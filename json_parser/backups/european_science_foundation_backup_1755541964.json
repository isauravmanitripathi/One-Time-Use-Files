It was established in\n1974 and its offices are located in Strasbourg, France (headquarters).\n\nESF Member Organizations are research-performing and research-funding\norganizations, academies and learned societies across Europe.\n\nAfter four decades of stimulating European research through its networking,\nESF undertook a re-alignment and re-calibration of its strategic vision and\nfocus. The launch of its Expert division \"Science Connect\" beginning of 2017\nmarks the next phase of its evolution and has been born out of an\nunderstanding of the science landscape, funding context and the needs of the\nresearch community."
