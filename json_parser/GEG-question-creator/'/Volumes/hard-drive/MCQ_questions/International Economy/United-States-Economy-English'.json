      "correct": 2,
      "explanations": {
        "0": "Incorrect. Political independence disrupted British trade privileges, prompting economic shifts rather than continuation of old trade dependencies.",
        "1": "Incorrect. Agriculture actually grew in importance post-independence, rather than declining.",

      "options": [
        "Being second largest by PPP implies the U.S. has a smaller population compared to the country ranked first, affecting total economic output.",
        "The difference suggests that the U.S. economy is more export-oriented, which inflates nominal GDP relative to PPP.",
        "Nominal GDP reflects the U.S. economy's size in current market exchange rates, while PPP accounts for cost of living differences, indicating the U.S. has higher price levels relative to other countries.",
        "Nominal GDP and PPP rankings are unrelated metrics and do not provide insights into economic structure or living standards."
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanations": {
        "0": "Incorrect. While population affects total GDP, PPP rankings primarily reflect price level adjustments, not population size directly.",
        "1": "Incorrect. Export orientation affects trade balance but does not directly explain the nominal vs PPP ranking difference.",
        "2": "Correct. Nominal GDP uses current exchange rates, which can be influenced by currency strength and price levels. PPP adjusts for cost of living and inflation differences, so the U.S. ranking lower by PPP suggests relatively higher domestic prices compared to other countries.",

        "The disparity suggests the U.S. dollar is undervalued, indicating potential for currency appreciation.",
        "The U.S. should increase its population size to boost its PPP share in the global economy.",
        "This difference implies the U.S. has relatively higher price levels, which may affect the cost competitiveness of its exports.",

      "correct": 2,
      "explanations": {
        "0": "Incorrect. The U.S. dollar is generally considered strong; an undervalued dollar would increase nominal GDP relative to PPP, not decrease it.",
        "1": "Incorrect. Population size affects total GDP but does not directly influence PPP-based economic share, which adjusts for price levels.",
        "2": "Correct. Higher domestic price levels mean goods and services are more expensive, reducing the U.S.'s PPP share and potentially making exports less competitive internationally.",

      "options": [
        "The U.S. dollar's dominance as a reserve currency is independent of the U.S. economic performance since World War II, relying solely on geopolitical factors.",

        "0": "Incorrect. The dollar's reserve status is closely tied to both economic performance and geopolitical influence; it is not independent of U.S. economic fundamentals post-WWII.",
        "1": "Correct. The large U.S. Treasuries market provides liquidity and safety for global investors, and the petrodollar system anchors demand for dollars internationally. These factors reinforce the dollar's reserve currency status, which supports economic stability including low unemployment and inflation.",
