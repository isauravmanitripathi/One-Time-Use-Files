              "question": "Which of the following best describes the relationship between Sierra Leone's external debt and its foreign exchange and gold reserves as of 31 December 2017?",
              "options": [
                "The foreign exchange and gold reserves cover less than one-third of the external debt, indicating potential vulnerability in debt servicing capacity.",
                "The reserves are irrelevant to external debt management as they are primarily used for domestic monetary policy.",
                "The external debt and reserves are approximately equal, implying balanced external financial health.",
                "The reserves exceed the external debt, suggesting a strong position to repay debts without additional borrowing."

              "correct": 0,
              "explanations": {
                "0": "Correct. With reserves at $478 million and debt at $1.615 billion, reserves cover less than one-third of debt, highlighting potential challenges in meeting external obligations (bullet points 1 and 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Foreign exchange and gold reserves are critical for external debt servicing, especially for paying interest and principal on foreign obligations.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The figures are not approximately equal; there is a substantial gap between debt and reserves.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Reserves do not exceed external debt; they are significantly lower, so this is factually incorrect."

              "question": "Analyzing Sierra Leone's import partners and external financial statistics from 2017, which comprehensive strategy would best enhance economic stability?",
              "options": [
                "Diversify import sources to reduce concentration risk, increase foreign exchange reserves through export promotion, and implement prudent debt management to lower external debt levels.",
                "Prioritize reducing imports from all partners equally without considering trade volumes or economic ties, while maintaining existing debt and reserves.",
                "Eliminate imports from countries with less than 5% share to concentrate trade with major partners and use reserves to finance increased imports.",
                "Focus solely on increasing foreign exchange reserves by borrowing more from major import partners to finance imports and maintain current debt levels."

              "correct": 0,
              "explanations": {
                "0": "Correct. This strategy synthesizes insights from all bullet points: diversification reduces risk (bullet point 0), boosting reserves aids in debt servicing (bullet point 2), and managing debt prudently addresses the high external debt (bullet point 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Reducing imports indiscriminately may disrupt supply chains and economic relations; ignoring debt and reserves is imprudent.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Eliminating imports from smaller partners may reduce diversification benefits and increase dependency risks; using reserves to finance more imports without increasing exports can worsen external imbalances.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Borrowing more to increase reserves without managing debt levels can exacerbate financial vulnerability."
