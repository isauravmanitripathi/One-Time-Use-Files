                "Inflation and real GDP contraction are unrelated and caused by independent external shocks.",

                "Rising inflation stimulates economic growth by encouraging higher consumer spending.",

                "1": "While contraction in GDP can affect inflation, typically demand-pull inflation decreases during recessions. The statement reverses the usual causality and does not explain the sharp inflation rise.",

                "3": "High inflation reduces consumers' real income, leading to lower demand for goods and services, which in turn contracts real GDP growth. This cause-effect relationship aligns with Sudan's 200.1% inflation and −20.3% real GDP growth in 2024."
