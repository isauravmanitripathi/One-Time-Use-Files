US influence and broader security calculations affected the larger pattern (bullet points 3 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Economic difficulties mattered (post‑war customs union failed), but the principal obstacle to a defence union was geopolitical—alliances and great‑power pressures—rather than purely affordability. The consultative body addressed political rather than economic constraints (bullet points 4 and 5).",
                "2": "Correct. The United States opposed a Scandinavian defence union and signalled support only for integration into the Atlantic system; Denmark and Norway accepted U.S. guarantees and joined NATO (bullet points 3 and 4). Given the Cold War security dilemma, a full defence union was politically and diplomatically costly. By contrast, Hans Hedtoft’s proposal for a consultative interparliamentary body (1951–52) offered a lower‑risk, non‑militarised means of cooperation acceptable to states with differing alignments and sensitivities (bullet points 4 and 5).",

US pressure and the differing security choices of Denmark and Norway (moving into NATO) were decisive factors; moreover, a consultative body could accommodate Sweden’s neutrality (bullet points 2, 3 and 5)."

The coalition mixes Social Democrats (who emphasise welfare and sustainability — Ilmari Nurminen and Ingalill Olsen — and also include Denmark's Henrik Møller who can provide cultural legitimacy) with Centre parties that prioritise Growth & Development (Jaspur Langgaard and Joakim Strand) and welfare (Inga Sæland).

Fiscal consolidation that cuts welfare contradicts the positions of several coalition members (welfare advocates like Ilmari Nurminen and Inga Sæland, and the Green Left’s welfare stance in the Faroe Islands).

                "1": "Incorrect. The passage does not make an absolute claim that supranational institutions never work in larger, diverse states; it argues political costs and strategic constraints make such moves difficult without adaptation and consensus.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The passage emphasizes political, constitutional, and strategic factors (not just economic disparities) as decisive obstacles to transplanting the Nordic model to India.",
                "3": "Correct. This option encapsulates the passage's multifaceted reasoning: even if cultural affinity and institutional cooperation lower costs (as in Nordic case), India's focus on sovereignty, treaty conflicts with existing alliances, and distributional politics mean wholesale transfer of the Nordic model would face major political obstacles."
