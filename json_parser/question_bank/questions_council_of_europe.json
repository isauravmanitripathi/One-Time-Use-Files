Bullet point 7 describes the Assembly’s proposal for a trans‑national court as a radical, innovative idea that foreshadowed the European Convention on Human Rights (opened for signature 1950) and the creation of the European Court of Human Rights.

Giving the Commissioner standing to litigate would create role confusion and potential politicisation, and could duplicate or strain the specialized judicial function of the ECHR (bullet 5). Instead, enhancing the Commissioner’s monitoring, reporting and formal referral channels to PACE and the Committee (bullets 3 and 2) preserves institutional complementarities, consistent with the CoE’s mixed model (bullet 0).",

The Commissioner’s role is designed for promotion, awareness‑raising, country visits and good‑practice advice (bullet 6). Granting direct litigatory powers risks politicising the office, blurring promotion and prosecution functions, and overlapping with the ECHR’s judicial mandate (bullet 5).",

Limiting litigation to systemic cases after other mechanisms have been used sounds like a compromise, yet it still risks blurring functions and creating parallel prosecutorial discretion within an office meant for promotion (bullet 6).

It enables leveraging comparative advantage rather than forcing institutional change.",

A full merger would be politically and legally complex, risk diluting specialised technical credibility (a comparative strength of semi‑autonomous bodies), and could undermine the nimbleness that allows Partial Agreements to be mobilised rapidly (for example in crisis responses).

Reinstatement can be interpreted as diplomatic normalization, but evidence from the Russia case shows that readmission split member states and did not reliably deter subsequent aggressive conduct (Russia was later suspended and excluded after the 2022 invasion — Index 1 and Index 3). Thus deterrence is not the strongest rights‑protection rationale.",

Suspension of parliamentary voting rights affects political participation in the assembly, but such procedural steps do not automatically nullify treaty obligations or eliminate individual access to judicial remedies while membership continues. The Russia case shows the opposite: participation rights were used as leverage, while legal remedies under the ECHR remained a central concern (Index 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While Russia’s withholding of dues from 2017 did create material strain on the CoE budget (Index 2), the primary pro‑reinstatement argument emphasized protection of citizens’ legal access to the ECtHR rather than an immediate fix to budgetary problems. Financial motives were secondary and would not, by themselves, justify reversing punitive measures aimed at state conduct (Index 1).",
                "3": "Correct. A central argument used by supporters of Russia's 2019 readmission (notably France and Germany) was that keeping Russia inside the CoE preserved Russian citizens’ access to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) under the ECHR, thereby protecting individual remedies (see bullet points Index 4 and Index 5). This trade‑off reflects the engagement‑versus‑accountability dilemma highlighted in the case study (Index 0 and Index 1)."

The bullet point (index 14) highlights strategic benefits (e.g., greater ability to contribute to policymaking) and also cautions that organisations are exposed to \"heightened scrutiny\" and obligations.

                "0": "Incorrect. The cluster warns against securitization only insofar as it should strengthen resilience; it does not advocate bypassing democratic safeguards. In fact, it calls for hardening legal, ethical and political systems domestically (Bullet 15) and active civil society oversight (Bullet 16).",
                "1": "Correct. This option captures the cluster's strategic rationale: erosion of norms in international organisations can translate into strategic vulnerabilities when adversaries exploit those forums (Bullet 15). Preserving multilateral integrity is thus tied to national security interests (Bullet 16).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The recommendations favour multilateral governance reform and transparency, not unilateral imposition of standards for national advantage. Treating institutional resilience as a security priority is about protecting the rule-based order, not securing preferential treatment (Bullets 15–16).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While stronger governance can have positive economic side-effects, the cluster frames the issue in strategic and normative terms—not primarily as a vehicle for short-term economic gain (Bullets 15–16)."

This option integrates the cluster’s dual recommendations: use domestic legal and prosecutorial tools to investigate and prosecute corrupt conduct when appropriate (Bullet 14), and press for internal governance and transparency reforms within the forum to prevent recurrence (Bullets 15–16). Together these steps both punish wrongdoing and strengthen institutional resilience.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Relying solely on the forum’s internal ethics mechanisms may be insufficient—cluster lessons show international processes can be constrained, and domestic courts played a corrective role in the Volontè case (Bullet 14). A combined domestic and multilateral approach is preferred (Bullets 14–16).",

                "1": "Incorrect. A global convention could help but is a long-term, uncertain prospect; the cluster advocates using existing domestic legal mechanisms proactively while pressing for internal reforms rather than waiting for new multilateral instruments (Bullet 14 and 15).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Public naming and blacklisting may have some deterrent effect but, without legal accountability and institutional reforms, is unlikely to prevent determined actors from exploiting governance gaps. The cluster emphasises prosecutorial action and governance strengthening (Bullets 14–16).",

This option reflects the cluster’s synthesis: proactive domestic legal tools to investigate and prosecute corruption in international contexts (Bullet 14), coupled with strengthening institutional governance and transparency in multilateral organisations and leveraging civil society oversight (Bullets 15–16).

The statement is over‑deterministic.",
                "1": "Correct. This option captures a realistic unintended consequence: securitising institutional integrity risks constraining the openness and plural oversight (including civil society and academia) that help detect corruption. The cluster advocates treating resilience as national security but also stresses the role of civil society and political safeguards (Bullets 15–16), implying that poor implementation could undermine those actors.",
                "2": "Incorrect. This is unrealistic; treating institutional resilience as a security priority may require resources and trade-offs. The cluster does not claim such measures come without costs; it instead argues for integration into policy and funding priorities (Bullet 15), not a no-cost reallocation.",
