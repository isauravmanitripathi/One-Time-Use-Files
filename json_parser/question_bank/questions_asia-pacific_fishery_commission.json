While MCS (bullet 4) is important to combat IUU and protect legitimate fishers, enforcement alone does not reframe management to account for habitat and multispecies interactions.

While voluntary withdrawal is possible, there is no strong evidence that metropolitan states routinely leave regional technical commissions simply to avoid compliance.

The historical churn referenced (bullet 5) more commonly points to territorial/representation changes than unilateral policy avoidance.",

Expulsion or formal sanction for failing to follow technical recommendations is unlikely in the FAO regional commission context because APFIC primarily offers advisory, capacity building and cooperative functions (bullet 9).

                "2": "Incorrect. Although the EU represents some fisheries interests multilaterally, APFIC membership is organized around states with jurisdiction or fisheries interests in the Asia‑Pacific region. A straightforward transfer of national membership to a supranational actor is uncommon. Moreover, the cluster highlights that non‑regional metropolitan states appear in APFIC because of overseas territories and extraterritorial jurisdiction (bullet 7), not because they are subsumed by a supranational representative in this forum.",
                "3": "Correct. The most plausible explanation — consistent with how regional FAO commissions have historically evolved — is that membership changes often reflect administrative reclassification, decolonization, or shifts in how overseas territories are represented. Metropolitan states like the Netherlands have historically been members primarily because of extraterritorial fisheries interests; when territories achieve different legal status or successor states assume jurisdiction, the metropolitan state’s membership may cease or be superseded. This interpretation aligns with the cluster point noting historical churn, withdrawal, administrative reclassification or decolonization as drivers of membership change (bullet 5) and with the broader pattern that APFIC’s membership follows jurisdictional and fishing activity footprints rather than strict continental geography (bullet 7)."
