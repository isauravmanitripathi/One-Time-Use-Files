The creation of an alternative venue in Singapore was designed to provide a geographically proximate forum for Asia–Pacific parties and to underline the Tribunal’s international character (Bullet 4).

The nine‑year judge terms create long‑tenured membership while the three‑year President/Vice‑President cycles (bullet points 3 and 4) enable regular leadership rotation. Together, these features preserve institutional memory and provide continuity in case assignment and administrative agenda, while still enabling periodic renewal of leadership and perspectives (bullet points 4 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Chamber composition and case assignment are influenced by staggered terms and leadership rotation, which tend to increase predictability rather than render it entirely unpredictable (bullet points 3, 4 and 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While the President has administrative influence, the President is elected only for a three‑year period from among judges who serve nine years; this limits continuous nine‑year control by any single President. The institutional design balances leadership influence with collective bench continuity (bullet points 3 and 4).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Wholesale changes every three years are unlikely because only the leadership posts rotate on a three‑year cycle; judges retain nine‑year terms, so the underlying bench changes more slowly (bullet point 3). The staggered leadership is designed to avoid abrupt jurisprudential shifts (bullet points 4 and 5)."

Provisional measures can be ordered to preserve rights or the status quo where urgency exists, but they are generally used to prevent further harm or preserve assets, not as the bespoke expedited remedy designed specifically for immediate release of detained vessels; moreover, provisional measures do not always direct release and the procedure is distinct from 'prompt release' (bullet point 3 and 4).",

The bullet point specifically notes provisional measures and their environmental consequences.

Provisional measures are intended as interim, urgent remedies and do not determine final rights (i.e., they do not resolve the merits such as delimitation). They can have operational (e.g., halting activities), environmental (preventing damage) and diplomatic consequences (affecting negotiations). Therefore India should expect an urgent, binding interim order (subject to compliance and enforcement realities) but not an immediate final settlement.",

This option conflates roles incorrectly.",

The bullet point highlights ITLOS’s core functions including “expedited prompt release relief” and “provisional measures where urgency demands.” Prompt release is specifically an expedited procedure for detained ships and crew, emphasizing quick release upon security/bail and addressing immediate liberty and economic impacts. Provisional measures are urgent interim steps to prevent serious or irreparable harm pending final adjudication, often with environmental/resource implications.",

The bullet point notes ITLOS’s core functions and explicitly mentions the “frequent interplay with diplomatic settlement” and operational, resource, environmental and diplomatic consequences.
