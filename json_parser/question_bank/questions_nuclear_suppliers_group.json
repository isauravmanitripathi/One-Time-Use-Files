The NSG does not have a formal rule that membership is strictly limited to NPT parties; in practice the group has debated non‑NPT participation and has had discussions (Seoul plenary 2017) about criteria (bullet 1).

The measures mirror the combination that helped make the India arrangement politically acceptable: India’s pledge not to transfer sensitive items, placing designated civilian facilities under IAEA safeguards, and delineation of civilian versus military facilities so suppliers could apply safeguards (see indexed 5). Framing these as legally enforceable and verifiable addresses concerns about precedent and robustness (see indexed 6 and indexed 9).",

Accession to the NPT by a non‑NPT state would indeed resolve many normative issues, but it is neither a realistic immediate condition for many states nor what occurred in India’s case.
