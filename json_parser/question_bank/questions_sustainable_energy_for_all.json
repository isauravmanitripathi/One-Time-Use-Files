                "3": "Incorrect. Legal/funding documents are important (bullet point 12) but focusing exclusively on them misses programmematic, diplomatic and financial interactions that determine strategic relevance (bullet point 14); a broader analytical frame is required."

                "Suspend all contacts with SEforALL until its legal status and funding sources are fully documented in academic literature.",

                "0": "Incorrect. Complete suspension is overly cautious and counterproductive. Bullet point 12 advises verification, but bullet point 14 underscores the strategic value of engagement; thus a balanced, conditional approach is preferable.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Offloading engagement to private sector partners neither resolves verification issues nor ensures alignment with national strategic objectives; bullet point 14 suggests governments have a stake in these forums and should manage engagements proactively with appropriate safeguards.",
                "2": "Correct. This option operationalizes cautious engagement: include clauses that require verification of funding/legal arrangements and use the recommended verification sources—SEforALL’s official publications and annual reports, UN announcements, reputable news and professional records—as suggested in bullet point 13, while recognizing the strategic importance of engagement noted in bullet point 14.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Informal engagement via media/events without verification fails to address the citation‑gap risks highlighted in bullet point 12 and does not provide due diligence needed for government partnerships."
