Consequently, from 1 January 2008 EFDA was reorganised to focus on preparing for ITER operation, coordinating scientific and personnel readiness, and developing the knowledge base for DEMO rather than direct procurement or operational contracting (bullet 4).",

The legal Domestic Agency model mandated separation of legal/contractual delivery, and F4E assumed those responsibilities (bullet 3), so EFDA did not retain the full pre‑2008 procurement/operational role after reorganisation (bullet 4).",
