These steps are designed to increase predictability and reduce misperception in the short term.",
                "1": "Incorrect. DDR is important for post‑conflict stabilization but is not an immediate preventive tool to defuse an ongoing stand‑off. UNODA links DDR to post‑conflict programs, not short‑term crisis prevention (bullet 0 and 5).",

                "3": "Incorrect. Withdrawing from transparency instruments like the UN Register may increase secrecy and suspicion. UNODA’s Register is meant to normalise openness and reduce uncertainty; selective participation is a practice states use, but outright withdrawal is counterproductive for immediate crisis management (bullet 6 and 7)."
