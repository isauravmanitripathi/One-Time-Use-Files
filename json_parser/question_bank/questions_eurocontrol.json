Redundancy is useful but insufficient without strong governance (bullets 0, 3).",

While a central repository like the EAD reduces fragmentation and improves authoritative access to AIPs and NOTAMs (bullet 3), it also changes workflows, system interfaces and incident responses. Maintaining safe, harmonised operations across multiple ANSPs still requires structured training (ALC) and competence development for controllers and technical staff (bullet 6). Thus centralisation does not eliminate training needs; it shifts and may intensify them.",

Bilateral/regional agreements (for example MUAC — Bullet Point 2) can produce operational pockets of success but lack the network-wide regulatory framework, technology coordination and funding scale required for pan‑European modernisation. The emergence of SES, delegated mandates and SESAR (Bullet Point 6) shows the need for broader institutional cooperation.",
