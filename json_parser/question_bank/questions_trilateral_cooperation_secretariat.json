This phased sequence eased consensus‑building and legitimized the project before committing to a binding framework (bullet 0)."

This option aligns with the conclusion that participation fits India’s preference for institutionalised, consensus‑based mechanisms and linkage of security with development (bullet 12). It combines soft power (cultural/educational exchanges) and economic integration (trade, connectivity) to reduce misperceptions and de‑escalate tensions (bullet 9), broadening the constituency for cooperation (bullet 7).",

Exclusive focus on hard economic projects ignores the recommended mixed toolkit that includes cultural diplomacy and civil‑society engagement to broaden support and amplify normative influence (bullet 7, 9, 11). Such a narrow approach risks political backlash and reduced legitimacy.",

While security cooperation is relevant, prioritising military and intelligence coordination contrasts with India’s emphasis on soft power and pragmatic development linkages noted in the chapter (bullets 7 and 12).

While cultural programmes are important for soft power (bullet 7), one‑off grand festivals are resource‑intensive, produce short‑term publicity rather than sustained credibility, and do little to address structural constraints such as M&E, financing, or political fissures (bullets 10 and 11). They are therefore the least reliable strategy to strengthen long‑term viability.",
