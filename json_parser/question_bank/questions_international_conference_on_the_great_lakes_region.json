This option captures the analytical membership logic set out in the cluster: ICGLR membership reflects broader regional interdependence where instability (especially in the DRC and adjacent areas) creates political, humanitarian and economic externalities—armed groups, refugee movements and illicit resource flows—that cross borders and therefore justify including non‑riparian states in a collective framework (bullets 0, 4, 2, 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While expanding membership can increase legitimacy in some contexts, this is a general diplomatic rationale and does not directly address the operational reasons underlying ICGLR membership. The cluster emphasises concrete cross‑border security and resource linkages (bullets 0, 1, 4), not mere size or prestige.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although geopolitical balancing can influence regional organisations, the cluster explicitly explains inclusion in terms of transnational security, governance and resource externalities rather than as a device for balancing larger powers.

It recognises porous borders and regional spill‑over dynamics (bullet 2 and 3).",

Relocation could be argued to enhance perceived neutrality; however, the cluster highlights the Secretariat’s historical role in Bujumbura as an administrative hub closely tied to programme coordination and diplomatic engagement in the Great Lakes theatre (bullet 3). Moving farther from the lake basin risks weakening those close operational ties more than it guarantees impartiality.",

This option aligns with cluster insights: the Secretariat in Bujumbura has historically been central to programme coordination and diplomatic engagement in the Great Lakes (bullet 3). Relocating to a more distant, non‑core capital could weaken immediate responsiveness to crises centred in the DRC and neighbouring riparians and disrupt existing administrative and diplomatic networks critical for addressing security, displacement and illicit resource exploitation (bullets 0, 1, 2, 4).",

Bilateral arrangements may be expedient in some cases but they fragment regional responses and fail to address the multi‑state, cross‑border dynamics of the Great Lakes region that the ICGLR exists to manage (bullets 1–3, 4).

Angola is included in the ICGLR because of cross‑border linkages with the DRC in security and resources (bullet 1), and while it borders the DRC, describing it as a major maritime power providing seaports ‘critical to lake trade routes’ is misleading—the lakes’ inland waterways are not served by Angola’s seaports in a direct way.

The ICGLR treats the Great Lakes as a politically and socially interconnected space where porous borders and local conflicts can quickly become regional problems (bullet 2 and 3). Consequently, purely hydrological/environmental approaches miss conflict, displacement, governance and illicit resource dynamics (bullet 4), so policies must integrate security, governance and socio‑economic dimensions.",
