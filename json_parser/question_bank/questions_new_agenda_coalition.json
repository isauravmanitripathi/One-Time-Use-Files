While moral leadership is part of middle‑power behaviour (bullet 1), unilateral reductions by NAC members (none of which are nuclear-armed) would be symbolic and unlikely to produce the verifiable, multilateral commitments NAC seeks. The coalition focuses on persuading nuclear-armed states and pressing for operational commitments, not unilateral gestures by non-nuclear states (bullets 2, 4, 5).",

NAC lacks the institutional authority, secretariat or enforcement mechanisms to impose binding military inspections; it operates through persuasion and procedural influence within the NPT process rather than coercive enforcement (bullets 0, 2, 3). Forcing inspections is also unrealistic politically and not aligned with NAC tactics.",

                "Join the TPNW immediately to signal commitment to humanitarian principles and then seek bilateral safeguards from neighbouring states to preserve deterrence.",
                "Declare a unilateral commitment to no‑first‑use (NFU) combined with phased, verifiable confidence‑building measures (data exchanges, notifications, narrow verification on non‑deployed items) and demand parallel security guarantees and non‑discriminatory implementation.",
                "Propose a global, immediate, legally binding timetable for irreversible dismantlement applicable to all states, with intrusive on‑site inspections enforced by a new UN body.",
                "Continue current posture without additional transparency, arguing that engagement yields no tangible security benefits and risks revealing operational vulnerabilities."

                "0": "Why incorrect: Immediate accession to TPNW would clash with India’s strategic posture as a non‑party to the NPT and its emphasis on strategic autonomy and credible deterrence (bullet 11). It also fails to address verification and equity concerns central to the practical‑versus‑prohibitionist dilemma (bullet 12).",
                "1": "Why correct: This option aligns with bullet points 10–12: it favours practical, verifiable, incremental measures that respect verification challenges (bullet 10), preserves India’s deterrent through NFU and selective transparency, and insists on non‑discrimination and security guarantees (bullets 11 and 12). It represents a realistic reconciliation of deterrence with disarmament engagement.",
                "2": "Why incorrect: A universal, immediate dismantlement timetable is impractical given the contested technical and political issues around verification, intrusiveness, and dual‑use ambiguities identified in bullet point 10, and would be unacceptable to states that prioritise deterrence and security guarantees (bullets 11 and 12).",
                "3": "Why incorrect: Non‑engagement ignores international expectations and the diplomatic opportunity presented by humanitarian discourse and NAC initiatives (bullet 11). It also forgoes influence over verification norms (bullet 10) and could harm India’s credibility in disarmament fora."
