                "Assume harmonization improved quality because co‑financings increased in frequency after agreements were signed",
                "Compare sectoral allocation of concessional finance (e.g., energy, SMEs, health) before and after cooperation and infer quality improvement from shifts in sectoral focus",
                "Compare pre‑ and post‑harmonization project performance metrics (disbursement speed, cost overruns, compliance incidents), analyze harmonized due diligence documents to identify changes, and conduct stakeholder interviews to understand operational impacts",
                "Rely solely on the text of harmonization clauses in the partnership agreements to conclude that harmonization must have improved execution"

              "correct": 2,
              "explanations": {
                "0": "Flawed inference. An increase in co‑financings alone does not prove improved project quality or faster execution; frequency may rise for many reasons (political will, funding availability) unrelated to harmonized safeguards (Bullet Point 1).",
                "1": "Indirect and incomplete. Sectoral shifts in concessional finance allocation may indicate strategic targeting but do not directly measure whether harmonized safeguards improved project quality or speed of execution—these require performance and implementation data (Bullet Point 1 and Bullet Point 3).",
                "2": "Correct. A credible test requires combining quantitative before‑and‑after project performance indicators (execution speed, cost and compliance metrics) with document analysis of harmonized safeguards/due diligence (to see what changed) and qualitative stakeholder interviews (to capture implementation realities). This directly follows the research agenda outlined to evaluate harmonization effects and project quality (Bullet Point 1 (Index 10) and Bullet Point 3 (Index 12)).",
                "3": "Insufficient. Contractual clauses show intent but do not measure outcomes; without empirical performance data and implementation insights, one cannot conclude that harmonization improved execution (Bullet Point 1; Bullet Point 3)."
