The UEBL (1921) is an example where closer economic integration was achieved while expressly preserving Luxembourgish prerogatives and administrative autonomy (bullet points 0 and 2).

This option accurately reflects the trade‑offs highlighted for BLEU: its official naming and drafting in multiple languages embodies accommodation of linguistic pluralism (bullet 2), which supports legitimacy and transparency, but it also is a non‑trivial design matter because language rights and legal precision can intersect and complicate interpretation (bullet 1).",
