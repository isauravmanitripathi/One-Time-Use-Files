                "1": "Incorrect. OHCHR does not have enforcement powers such as imposing binding sanctions. Its tools are normative, monitoring, reporting, advocacy and technical assistance (bullet points 0, 3 and 4). Enforcement actions are the province of member states and other UN political organs.",

This option synthesizes OHCHR’s three interlinked functions: system‑wide coordination, secretariat support to intergovernmental bodies such as the Human Rights Council, and operational/diplomatic engagement through advocacy, reporting and state engagement (bullet points 2 and 3).

The text highlights funding variability (voluntary contributions) as a primary driver of uneven field presence (bullet point 5).",

US$201.6 million and ~3.7% of the UN regular budget for 2018–19) gives context to resourcing (bullet point 6), the explanation is incomplete: the key operational constraint emphasized in the material is reliance on voluntary funds and variable resource availability, which more directly drive unpredictability and uneven presence (bullet point 5).",

While the EOSG is influential (bullet 3/index 3), directly trying to block or delay a rapporteur’s report is generally impractical and outside the routine remit of member‑state engagement; moreover, the Office’s mission support during visits is a more appropriate channel for shaping content.",
