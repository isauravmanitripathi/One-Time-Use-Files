Reducing threats may be an indirect or long‑term effect if rights‑compliant reforms reduce grievances (bullet points 2, 4, 5), but it is not a guaranteed immediate outcome.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While OHCHR attention can shape international narratives and influence multilateral forums (bullet point 3), an automatic or uniform improvement in bilateral relations with all strategic partners is unlikely; reactions vary by partner and depend on strategic calculations rather than solely on human‑rights reporting.",

The Vienna Declaration provided a modern political reaffirmation and impetus for strengthening the UN human‑rights machinery, and General Assembly resolution 48/141 formally created the High Commissioner and the Office as the authorized interlocutor with States (bullets 1, 2 and 3).

Reassigning the entire budget to a new thematic priority is a strategic programme decision with fiscal and policy implications that go beyond routine delegated authority.

The cluster indicates OHCHR‑NY can and does influence both normative framing and operational outcomes (Bullets 10, 11 and 12).
