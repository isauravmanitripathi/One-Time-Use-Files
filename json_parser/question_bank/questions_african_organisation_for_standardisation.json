While ARSO’s membership is commonly cited as 43 member states (bullet point 1), the scenario describes an exporter from an African country in contact with ARSO processes.

Tariff barriers are a different category of trade barriers; the scenario describes repeated failure despite harmonized standards and ARSO alignment, pointing to non-tariff/technical conformity issues rather than tariffs. The cluster focuses on technical barriers and quality infrastructure (bullet points 1 and 2).",

This option synthesizes key points from the cluster: while ARSO develops and aligns continental standards with international norms (bullet point 3), actual market access depends on national-level adoption of those continental standards and on functioning quality infrastructure (testing, inspection, certification, accreditation, metrology) so producers can prove conformity (bullet point 2). A failure at the national implementation or conformity-assessment level explains why exporters may still be denied entry."

Combining (A) and (C) addresses both the supply side (building quality infrastructure and conformity assessment capacity — bullet point 2) and the governance/adoption side (political and legal adoption of continental standards by national regulators and private sector actors — bullet point 2 and 1). This combination is aligned with ARSO’s operational mandate to harmonize standards and promote quality infrastructure and to advocate for adoption by national regulators (bullet points 1 and 2).",

Strengthening quality infrastructure (testing, inspection, certification, accreditation, metrology) is essential (bullet point 2) and would significantly reduce technical barriers.

While encouraging adoption (C) is useful, relying primarily on bilateral agreements (D) fragments the market and does not address systemic deficiencies in continental harmonization or quality infrastructure.

Dismissing alignment ignores a major category of non‑tariff barriers that ARSO seeks to address.",

Acceptance in external markets also depends on demonstrable conformity through testing, certification and accreditation and on national adoption of continental standards (bullet points 2 and 3). Therefore alignment alone does not automatically secure market access.",

This option integrates the three cluster points: ARSO aligns continental standards with international benchmarks (bullet point 3), but improved export competitiveness requires functioning quality infrastructure (testing, inspection, certification, accreditation, metrology) and the adoption of continental standards by national regulators and the private sector (bullet points 1 and 2).

Governance and resource arrangements materially affect the pace and legitimacy of harmonisation, so dismissing those factors is inconsistent with the cluster.",

The founding character as an intergovernmental initiative (bullet point 1, index 3) implies state leadership and predictable member funding, which confers political legitimacy and financial stability.
