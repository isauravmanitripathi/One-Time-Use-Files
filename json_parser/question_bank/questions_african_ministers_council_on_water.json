              "options": [
                "Opportunity because AMCOW aggregates diverse national priorities offering scalable channels for cooperation; constraint because heterogeneity of basin hydropolitics, island and Sahelian needs, and AU politics (including contested memberships) require regionally differentiated programming and careful multilateral coordination.",
                "Opportunity because AMCOW centralizes all donor funding decisions at continental level; constraint because its technical capacity is limited for on‑the‑ground implementation.",
                "Opportunity because uniform continental membership simplifies programming; constraint because AMCOW’s statutes prevent bilateral projects with external partners.",
                "Opportunity because contested memberships (e.g., SADR) give India leverage to pick preferred partners; constraint because donor coordination is unnecessary when AMCOW membership is broad."

              "explanations": {
                "0": "Correct. This option captures the dual nature described: AMCOW aggregates varied priorities across river basins, islands and Sahel regions (opportunity for scalable South–South cooperation) while the heterogeneity and AU politics (including contested memberships) mean India must pursue regionally differentiated programmes, coordinate with multilateral partners, and conduct rigorous basin-level analysis to realize measurable benefits.",
                "1": "Incorrect. AMCOW does not centralize all donor funding decisions; donors still act bilaterally and multilaterally. While technical capacity is a consideration, the primary constraint highlighted is political heterogeneity and contested memberships rather than merely implementation capacity.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Near‑universal membership does not 'simplify programming'—the bullet points stress heterogeneity (river hydropolitics, island scarcity, Sahel drought). Also, AMCOW statutes do not categorically prevent bilateral projects with external partners; the issue is more about AU politics and coordination.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Contested memberships do not automatically give India leverage to pick partners; on the contrary, they can complicate donor behaviour and ministerial participation. Saying donor coordination is unnecessary contradicts the need for coordination emphasized in the bullets."

              "options": [
                "Design multilateral, AMCOW‑anchored programmes with neutral technical selection criteria, basin‑level pilots in willing riparians, and coordination mechanisms that include political risk mitigation templates — combining institutional review, basin analysis and donor coordination.",
                "Focus on cultural and awareness exchanges (sanitation campaigns, workshops) that avoid technical interventions and thereby sidestep contested membership issues.",
                "Channel all activities exclusively through multilateral donors (World Bank, AfDB) without AMCOW involvement, thus insulating India from AU political disputes.",

              "explanations": {
                "0": "Correct. This option aligns with the recommended approach: use AMCOW’s continental platform, apply neutral technical criteria, focus on basin‑level pilots in willing riparians, and include political risk mitigation templates informed by institutional review and basin analysis. That combination addresses both technical effectiveness and diplomatic sensitivity (as highlighted in the bullets).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Cultural and awareness programmes are useful but insufficient for demonstrative technical projects (e.g., desalination, groundwater recharge). Avoiding technical interventions altogether does not exploit India’s comparative advantages nor does it address the need for measurable development and strategic dividends emphasized in the text.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Exclusively using multilateral donors might insulate India to an extent, but bypassing AMCOW foregoes a continental platform that aggregates national priorities and enables scalable South–South cooperation. The recommendations call for coordination with multilateral partners, not exclusion of AMCOW.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Bilateral projects outside AMCOW may avoid some AU politics but risk undermining AMCOW’s role, create duplication, and may be viewed as sidestepping continental processes — potentially provoking diplomatic friction rather than mitigating it. The bullets emphasise using AMCOW as a structured channel and developing engagement templates to manage diplomacy."
