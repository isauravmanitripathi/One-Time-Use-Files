Weak monitoring and lack of independent verification undermine investor confidence and project bankability (private partners require credible performance data), exacerbate delays and cost overruns (implementation problems go undetected), and make it hard to demonstrate beneficiary impacts or ensure financial sustainability post‑implementation.
