                "0": "Correct — This is a realistic policy risk: relying solely on UNCDF’s catalytic, pilot‑oriented support might lead India to underinvest in longer‑term engagement and capacity‑building. The bullets indicate UNCDF’s strength is catalytic and modestly funded; to achieve sustainable strategic outcomes India must complement catalytic interventions with sustained engagement (Bullets 12 & 13).",
                "1": "Incorrect — The bullets explicitly portray UNCDF as a complementary partner rather than a competitor. The risk of competition crowding out Indian investments is low if roles are coordinated; moreover this option misreads UNCDF’s mandate (Bullet 12).",
                "2": "Incorrect — The concern in this option is the opposite of good practice. The bullets suggest UNCDF’s catalytic financing is valuable; limiting it to advisory roles would underutilise its comparative advantage rather than being a risk to mitigate (Bullets 12 & 13).",
                "3": "Incorrect — The bullets state UNCDF has modest core funding and a catalytic mandate; expecting it alone to resolve systemic governance issues is unrealistic, but the statement here is a mischaracterisation (UNCDF does not have large core funding). The actual risk is over‑reliance on catalytic inputs without long‑term commitments (Bullets 12 & 13)."
