              "options": [
                "A combination of mounting cost growth, schedule delays and complex transnational integration/industrial‑policy risks made the French‑derived conventional design unaffordable and strategically less attractive, prompting Australia to pursue a nuclear solution with AUKUS partners.",
                "Because the 2009 Defence White Paper explicitly excluded nuclear propulsion, Canberra reversed course only due to a change in government policy that unambiguously mandated nuclear submarines.",
                "The decision was driven solely by Naval Group’s technical inability to adapt the French Barracuda (nuclear) design into a safe and effective diesel‑electric platform, leaving no viable conventional alternative.",

                "0": "Correct. The cancellation reflected multiple interacting problems: years of cost growth and schedule slips that pushed program estimates toward much higher figures (bullet 6), the transnational nature of the design that blended a French hull with U.S. systems and an Australian industrial content which created complex integration and industrial‑policy risks (bullets 3 and 4), and the strategic judgment that a nuclear‑propelled pathway with US/UK partners better met long‑term security requirements (bullet 0). These combined factors made the Attack‑class as proposed unaffordable and operationally or industrially risky, motivating the AUKUS shift.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The 2009 Defence White Paper did rule out nuclear propulsion in the near term and set the intention for a conventional successor (bullet 1). The 2021 pivot therefore involved reversing that earlier policy stance in response to later program realities; it was not a simple one‑time policy mandate but a response to evolving cost, schedule and strategic considerations.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Technical adaptation challenges were a factor—reconfiguring a design derived from a nuclear hull for diesel‑electric propulsion added complexity (bullet 2)—but the cancellation cannot be attributed solely to Naval Group’s inability to adapt the design. Cost escalation, industrial policy requirements and strategic recalibration were central drivers (bullets 6, 4 and 0).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While alliance options with the US/UK were decisive in the pivot, it is inaccurate to say the decision was driven solely by an offer of immediate delivery with no industrial conditions. The move reflected broader affordability and sovereign‑capability concerns as well as strategic alignment; moreover, there were significant industrial and training implications tied to nuclear propulsion that could not be described as having 'no domestic industrial conditions' (bullets 4 and 5)."

This captures the balanced approach indicated by the episode: contractual design that includes control gates and off‑ramps helps manage legal and financial exposures (bullet 15 and 16), phased investment reduces the risk of wasted long‑term commitments in human capital and infrastructure (bullet 14), and alliance‑compatible pathways preserve interoperability while limiting sovereign isolation (bullet 20).

While domestic sovereignty can be desirable, pursuing it irrespective of cost often proves difficult and expensive in isolation (bullet 20) and does not eliminate the need for long‑term investments in people, regulation and infrastructure (bullet 14).

The realistic path to enable rotational SSN basing while respecting non‑proliferation and domestic political realities is a combination of steps: establish clear domestic legal and regulatory frameworks for nuclear‑propelled vessels (since the deal concerns propulsion not weapons, but HEU use raises sensitive regulatory issues — bullet 2), negotiate detailed bilateral basing and fuel‑handling agreements with the US/UK (bullet 2), conduct environmental assessments and public consultations to address domestic concerns (bullet 6), and coordinate with international bodies or partners on safeguards and transparency where relevant. These measures balance operational needs with legal/safety and political legitimacy.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Stationing nuclear warheads would change the fundamental character of the arrangement and contradict the stated focus on propulsion rather than weapons (bullet 2), likely violate Australia’s non‑proliferation posture and provoke severe domestic and regional backlash (bullets 4 and 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Secret bilateral arrangements that bypass domestic law and public debate would aggravate domestic political opposition and international mistrust (as exemplified by the diplomatic fallout and public upset over the submarine contract cancellation), and would not resolve regulatory or safety requirements for HEU and naval nuclear propulsion (bullets 2 and 6).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Building civilian HEU production is unnecessary, politically fraught, and would raise greater proliferation concerns; moreover, unilaterally exempting SSNs from safeguards would undermine international non‑proliferation norms (bullet 2)."

LEU propulsion is technically attractive for non‑proliferation, but current operational SSN designs typically use HEU; switching to LEU would require major design changes and is not a simple avoidance of safeguards (Bullet 1 — Index 7).

While HEU reduces refuelling needs, it does not make industrial development simpler; secure handling, specialised maintenance and stringent security protocols increase domestic institutional complexity. A skilled workforce is still required for reactor support, maintenance and submarine systems. LEU is not inherently too complex for domestic industry; it simply entails different infrastructure.",

This option synthesises the technical trade‑offs: US/UK naval reactors have historically used HEU enabling life‑of‑ship cores (bullet 6), which reduces logistical complexity associated with refuelling but creates significant security and non‑proliferation challenges because HEU (~93% U‑235) is weapons‑usable. By contrast, French LEU proposals (bullet 6) typically require mid‑life refuelling (~every 10 years), creating industrial demands for refuelling infrastructure, supply chains and regulatory frameworks even though LEU (<6%) has lower proliferation risk. The SSN‑AUKUS design and domestic build plans (bullet 3) must therefore accommodate whichever fuel cycle choice is made.",

The incompatibility claim ignores the fact that design choices (e.g., SSN‑AUKUS derived from UK SSNR — bullet 3) can be paired with different reactor/fuel approaches through programme decisions; the real issue is industrial/regulatory adaptation."

                "0": "Incorrect. It is unlikely that national defence industries in AUKUS countries would dissolve; instead, they are more likely to be integrated, restructured or strengthened through joint projects. The bullet points to specific industrial commitments, not outsourcing leading to dissolution.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Universal liberalisation of arms markets is implausible given sensitive technologies like nuclear propulsion and strategic considerations. The bullet implies closer, selective industrial collaboration rather than global equal access.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Complete transparency of sensitive technology‑transfer agreements is unlikely because states preserve strategic ambiguity and protect commercial and security interests. The bullet’s emphasis on regulatory harmonisation and industrial commitments suggests negotiated, often classified arrangements rather than full public disclosure.",
                "3": "Correct. The bullet describes a shift towards operational programmes with detailed technology transfers and industrial commitments. Such processes commonly produce preferential supply chains and close industrial linkages among partners, accelerating capability delivery for members and raising entry barriers for non‑members — a direct industrial and diplomatic ramification that India should monitor for lessons and early warning."
