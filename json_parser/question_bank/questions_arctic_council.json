Unilateral military buildup escalates tensions and undermines cooperative problem‑solving; retrospective endorsement would be unlikely given the Council's technical remit and the political sensitivities (bullets 0 and 3). It risks turning the Arctic into an arena of open competition, as characterized in great‑power rhetoric.",
                "2": "Correct. The Ottawa Declaration deliberately excluded \"military security\" to keep the Council technical and consensus‑based, insulating it from great‑power rivalry (bullet 0). The Council's comparative advantage lies in technical cooperation—SAR coordination, pollution response, scientific assessment and sustainable development standards—which are also politically palatable even amid tensions (bullet 1). Using separate diplomatic or military channels to handle security matters preserves the Council's functionality and avoids politicizing its technical work (bullet 3).",

Seeking urgent binding orders for both liability and boundary delimitation would be slow and could impede timely SAR and pollution response; delimitation remains a political/legal process beyond the Council's technical remit (bullets 1 and 6).",

The CLCS issues technical recommendations about continental‑shelf limits but does not resolve political boundary delimitation; overlapping determinations still require bilateral or multilateral negotiation (bullet 6).
