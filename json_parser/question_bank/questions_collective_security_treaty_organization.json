The CSTO’s full‑consent consensus model safeguards minority positions and member sovereignty but can lead to paralysis when a single member blocks action (bullet 5 / index 4). Formal mechanisms therefore protect against unilateral commitments (bullet 1 / index 0; bullet 3 / index 3). However, informal power asymmetries—especially Russia’s political and military weight—can shape outcomes and enable influential states to sustain continuity or exert pressure outside formal collective channels, including bilateral arrangements with the host state (bullet 6 / index 5). This combination explains the sequence described.",
