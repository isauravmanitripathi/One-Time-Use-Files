There is no general prohibition in international law that prevents an organisation from accepting host-state financing; the issue is political legitimacy and member‑state consent, not a blanket legal ban. The cluster highlights political and diplomatic dynamics rather than a legal prohibition (bullets 0 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While domestic public opinion in a prospective host can matter, the primary barrier illustrated in the cluster was lack of sufficient external diplomatic support (the 22–14 vote and broader member reluctance), not domestic opposition in the prospective host (bullets 3 and 4).",
                "2": "Correct. The Qatar episode shows that promises to finance a new HQ and cover relocation costs are powerful inducements (bullet 0 and bullet 5), but relocation decisions hinge on broad diplomatic support among member states. Bullet 5 explicitly notes that material incentives rarely substitute for the wider diplomatic backing needed to effect relocations.",

The Qatar offer explicitly pledged to cover construction and relocation costs (bullet 0 and bullet 5), so underestimation of costs was not presented as the proximate reason for failure; instead the withdrawal followed a failure to obtain member-state support (bullet 4)."

Annex 13 tasks contracting states, through their national investigation bodies, with investigations, coordinated with other states and ICAO guidance if needed. Referring the probe to the Council would be impractical and inconsistent with ICAO’s operational model (bullet point 1 and 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Allowing the airline’s home State or the airline to conduct the investigation would create conflicts of interest and contradict Annex 13’s emphasis on independent, technical investigations by the State of Occurrence or an impartial national body. Commercial sensitivity is not a sufficient reason to cede investigative leadership (bullet point 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While the State of Registry has a legitimate interest and must be involved, Annex 13 does not automatically transfer the lead investigative role to the State of Registry. The State of Occurrence typically leads, and yielding leadership solely to avoid tensions would contravene Annex 13 norms and risk undermining the perceived impartiality and technical rigor of the probe (bullet point 1).",
                "3": "Correct. Annex 13 frames accident investigation as a technical exercise focused on preventing future accidents and improving safety rather than apportioning blame. The State of Occurrence has the primary responsibility to conduct the investigation but must invite accredited representatives from the State of Registry and State of the Operator (and others as relevant). Sharing factual, technical findings and coordinating with involved states helps manage diplomatic sensitivities while maintaining investigative integrity (bullet point 1). This approach balances sovereignty (State X’s investigative role) with inter‑state cooperation."

Participation in ICAO grants access to standards‑setting processes and timely operational information; exclusion limits an actor’s ability to contribute to and receive the full range of technical coordination, which can produce divergent procedures and increase safety/operational risks.

Obstacle limitation surfaces are part of the design envelope, but the A380 incompatibility with an E aerodrome is broader — it involves wingspan clearances, taxiway fillets, apron stands and pavement loading arrangements (bullets 4 and 5).

While a national ETS can be rigorous, applying it to flights into and out of the country raises extraterritoriality and legal controversy, as seen when the EU included flights within, into and out of the EEA (bullet 6).

However, it fails to address the larger share of emissions from international aviation and may be inadequate to meet climate objectives; moreover, it avoids but does not resolve the international governance question discussed in the cluster (bullets 1–4).",
                "2": "Correct. Under the historical bifurcation (Kyoto era) international aviation emissions have been delegated to ICAO rather than national inventories (bullet 1 and 2). ICAO is the specialized UN agency responsible for international flights (bullet 2 and 3) and later developed global measures (e.g., CORSIA) to provide a multilateral, uniform approach (editorial note bullet 0; MBMs and offsetting discussed in bullets 3 and 4). Relying on ICAO-led global measures preserves the international institutional allocation, reduces claims of extraterritoriality and aligns with the role ICAO plays in facilitating participation and providing technical guidance (bullet 5).",

Requiring foreign carriers to offset under a unilateral national regime effectively imposes domestic rules on international actors, raising extra‑territoriality and sovereignty issues similar to those provoked by the EU ETS (bullet 6).

Moreover, CO2 and NOx are subject to different policy regimes (bullet 2); focusing exclusively on both without considering operability and other emissions is unrealistic.",

This option synthesises recommendations from Bullet Point 1 (Index 14): advocate a federated architecture to preserve domestic control, rapidly operationalise national standards (Remote ID, secure APIs) for plug‑and‑play integration, and negotiate MOUs for access, evidence and data protection. It also reflects Bullet Point 2 (Index 15) that political design—preserving sovereignty, calibrating access, harmonising standards and sequencing through interoperable federated steps—determines the ledger’s value.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While centralisation may simplify technical interoperability, Bullet Point 2 emphasises that value depends less on a single technological choice and more on political design that preserves state sovereignty. A centralized ICAO-hosted ledger risks undermining sovereign prerogatives and is likely to generate diplomatic resistance and operational constraints for states like India (Bullet Points 14 & 15).",
