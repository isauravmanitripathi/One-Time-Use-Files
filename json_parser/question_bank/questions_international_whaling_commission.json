Using the Committee’s evidence strengthens technical legitimacy, and combining that with coalition-building and domestic stakeholder engagement aligns with how states operate within the IWC—where science, law and normative claims intersect and where domestic constituencies matter (bullet points 4, 5 and 7). This approach leverages institutional rhythm and respects the Commission’s procedural design rather than trying to bypass it.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Special (intersessional) meetings are distinct and have been rare (only five between 1949 and 2007) and are intended for urgent or technical matters (bullet point 3). Requesting one immediately is politically costly, unlikely to succeed routinely, and may be seen as an attempt to politicise procedure rather than build evidence-based consensus (bullet points 3 and 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Bilateralism can yield benefits, but deferring multilateral engagement ignores the continuous scientific advisory stream (annual Scientific Committee) and the multilateral nature of marine governance (bullet points 4, 6 and 7). Waiting until a future plenary cedes agenda-setting and narrative control to other actors and weakens India’s influence.",
                "3": "Incorrect. NGO and media-led reputational strategies can be powerful (bullet point 5) but relying primarily on them risks domestic blowback and may not produce the scientific or legal basis needed in IWC deliberations. Effective diplomacy typically combines scientific evidence, coalition-building and targeted public outreach rather than depending only on activism."

The Commission’s debates split along pro- and anti-whaling lines, shaped by domestic economic interests, cultural practices and diplomatic alignments; coupled with an organised anti-whaling movement and media attention, meetings became highly politicised (bullet points 4 and 5). Science, law and normative claims intersect in these fora, producing high reputational stakes for delegations (bullet points 0 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Special meetings were rare (five between 1949 and 2007) and are meant for urgent or technical issues (bullet point 3). They are not the principal reason for the IWC’s sustained politicisation—which stems from deeper state interests and activist engagement (bullet points 4 and 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The Scientific Committee’s annual work provides continuous technical advice and is generally seen as a stabilising, evidence-based input rather than the main source of manipulation (bullet point 6). While scientific findings can be contested politically, the statement overstates intentional manipulation by host states as the primary cause (contradicted by bullet points 4, 5 and 6).",

While many early meetings were held in the UK and the Secretariat was UK-based (bullet points 1, 2 and 6), concentration of hosts alone does not explain the Commission’s politicisation.

The IWC’s history—founded under the 1946 Convention and meeting frequently in the UK where the Secretariat was based—reflects administrative origins and Western institutional centrality (bullet points 0, 1 and 6). Later global hosting indicates increased geographic inclusivity, but agenda-setting still requires diplomatic coalition-building and scientific engagement; hence India must invest diplomatically and in scientific inputs to shape outcomes (bullet point 7).",

Withdrawal would remove treaty obligations but also remove the state from the Convention; it is therefore not the pathway to remain within the ICRW while avoiding the specific measure.

Excluding the contentious issue sounds pragmatic but is often impractical: the controversy shapes member identities and mandates (the IWC’s mandate was framed historically by debates around whaling — bullet 1).
