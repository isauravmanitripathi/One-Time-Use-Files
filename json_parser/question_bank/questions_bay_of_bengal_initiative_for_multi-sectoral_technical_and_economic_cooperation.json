Bullet 0 explains the Secretariat was created to transition BIMSTEC from an ad hoc, summit‑centred model to a standing institutional architecture for continuity in project implementation and record‑keeping. Bullet 3 and 4 emphasise the Secretariat’s role as institutional memory and that functioning secretariat is essential for medium‑term planning and reliable project delivery. Reverting would therefore undermine continuity, institutional memory and cause delays.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Although national ministries may have ownership, bullets 3 and 4 indicate that cross‑border projects require a coordinating institution to manage implementation and continuity; removing the Secretariat would likely fragment responsibility and slow progress, not speed it up.",
                "2": "Incorrect. This underestimates the Secretariat’s role. Bullets 0 and 3 show that summit declarations without a standing body to monitor, coordinate and implement decisions are insufficient to guarantee continuity across political cycles; hence significant change would occur.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While reduced overheads might seem attractive, bullets 0 and 4 indicate the Secretariat provides routine coordination and continuity crucial for implementation; the overhead savings are unlikely to offset the loss of institutional memory and predictable coordination, which typically increases delays rather than speeding approvals."

While Bhutan’s King is head of state, day-to-day executive authority rests with Bhutan’s Prime Minister and cabinet; thus the King would not normally be the one to sign executive cooperation instruments (bullet point 2). Sri Lanka’s head of government is the President, not the Prime Minister, so assigning signing to the PM is wrong (bullet point 2).",

Bhutan is a constitutional monarchy: the King is head of state but executive authority is exercised by the Prime Minister and cabinet, so the Prime Minister would normally sign executive agreements (bullet point 2). Sri Lanka has a presidential system where the President is both head of state and government and thus would sign (bullet point 2 and 5).
