Bullet point 1 emphasises that national hydrographic offices and their legal/budgetary frameworks must adopt and resource IHO measures; this often requires legislative support, capital investment and sustained funding for training. Bullet point 12 underlines that aligning national practice with IHO norms is both a technical necessity and strategic opportunity that requires continuous investment in training, institutional implementation and technological updating.

Non‑participation would likely elevate navigational risk for transiting ships, reduce the country’s influence over regional survey priorities and charting standards, and limit integration of hydrographic data into frameworks for maritime safety and environmental protection—precisely the functions the IHO provides and that are strategically important for maritime states (Bullet Points 1, 3, 4 and 5).",

The bullet emphasizes that IHO standardization reduces duplication, improves interoperability and materially enhances safety and operational effectiveness; divergence by a neighbour would fragment navigational data and create safety and defence interoperability gaps.
