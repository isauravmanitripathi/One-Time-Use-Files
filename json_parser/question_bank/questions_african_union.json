                "1": "Incorrect. Although the AU has greater institutional capacity than the OAU, it was not established to centralise sovereignty into a supranational government. The Constitutive Act emphasises both respecting member states’ sovereignty and pursuing collective action, reflecting a balance rather than an overriding of state authority (bullet point 2).",

The Sirte Declaration and the launch of the AU signalled a conceptual move away from the OAU’s decolonisation and solidarity emphasis toward an organisation with explicit institutional ambitions — stronger governance mechanisms, accelerated political and socio‑economic integration, and active conflict prevention and management (see bullet point 1 and bullet point 2).",

Statement A is correct because the AU (through the Peace and Security Council) has an explicit mandate for conflict prevention, management and authorisation of peace support operations and can act when member states are unable to respond effectively (bullet point 2 and bullet point 3). Statement B is incorrect because, while the AU emphasises sovereignty and territorial integrity, its mandate and practice recognise circumstances (e.g., threats to peace, humanitarian crises, or when the state is unable to act) where collective action may occur even without full domestic consent, subject to political constraints and member states’ will (bullet point 2 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Statement A is correct and Statement B is too absolute to be correct; thus 'neither' is not accurate. The AU balances respect for sovereignty with a mandate to protect peace and security, creating nuanced possibilities for intervention (bullet point 2 and 3).",

Phased procedural reforms and reliance on existing organs (e.g., Executive Council, AUC) are more feasible (bullet point 3 and bullet point 1).",
                "1": "Correct. One of the core practical constraints is the need to coordinate policies among multiple RECs and the dependence on member states’ political will and administrative capacity to implement continental policies (bullet point 2). A realistic mitigation combines institutionalised AU–REC protocols, phased implementation to allow RECs and states to adapt, and AUC‑led capacity building and technical assistance — measures consistent with the AU’s stated objective to coordinate and harmonise policies (bullet point 2 and bullet point 3).",

Statement 2 aligns with bullet point 1's call for assessing India's comparative advantage to shape complementary engagement, and statement 3 aligns with the recommendation to study participation in multilateral trust funds or innovative financing mechanisms to reduce donor dependency.

Option A aligns with the cluster's synthesis: the Constitutive Act provides a clearer normative scope and the Abuja Treaty intentionally outsources implementation to RECs (bullets 1 and 2). The problem is overlapping memberships and incoherence (bullet point 3). A pragmatic AU‑led harmonization and coordination approach preserves political legitimacy and REC strengths while addressing incoherence — realistic and consistent with the AU's evolutionary trajectory.",

Forcing states to choose a single REC (B) is politically implausible and infringes on sovereignty; it ignores the historical and political realities noted in the cluster, including the primacy of sovereignty that constrained early collective action (bullet point 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Relying solely on informal coordination and market adjustments (D) is insufficient. The cluster emphasizes that summit declarations can generate political momentum but implementation requires legal follow‑through and administrative capacity; informal mechanisms will not reliably resolve legal or policy incoherence from overlapping REC memberships (bullet point 3).",

Centralizing all authority at AU headquarters (C) would undermine the pragmatic leverage of RECs and is unlikely politically feasible given member states' concerns about sovereignty and the entrenched role of RECs (bullets 1 and 2).

Targeted capacity‑building and predictable finance align with India’s strategic culture of pragmatic burden‑sharing and South–South cooperation while respecting AU and member‑state sovereignty.

This option integrates bullet point 5’s insight that the AUC is less centralised, depends on member‑state political backing and external funding, and is constrained in implementation.

Military or defence support for peace operations may yield influence in security circles, but it does not address the AUC’s broader implementation constraints across trade, social affairs, infrastructure and the need for political buy‑in (bullet points 3 and 5).

Improved technical standards in pharmaceuticals, e‑commerce and energy planning foster predictable regulatory environments and secure supply chains that support logistics and mission sustainability for PSC operations (Bullet 1). Legal predictability (Bullet 2) also benefits when technical norms are harmonized, reducing disputes and facilitating mutual legal assistance and investment protection.",

Many STCs are under‑operational and need capacity building to harmonize standards that affect logistics and governance (Bullet 3). Evolving continental jurisprudence has implications for extradition, mutual legal assistance and investment protection, meaning legal cooperation and adjustment of bilateral agreements are important (Bullet 2).

Strict non‑interference ignores the practical operational impacts identified in Bullet Point 1 (e.g., need for contingency planning) and runs counter to the recommended proactive, coordinated engagement with AU/RECs in Bullet Point 2. Reducing contact would limit India’s ability to shape outcomes or protect its interests.",

Mapping coups and jihadist violence (Bullet Point 14) is crucial for Sahel policy and for designing assistance, but it is less directly tied to membership politics in North and East Africa compared with Western Sahara/Somaliland dynamics.",

The AU’s suspension mechanism is a collective disciplinary tool aimed at restoring constitutional order (bullet 3), but it does not impose specific legal obligations on external partners to sever bilateral ties.
