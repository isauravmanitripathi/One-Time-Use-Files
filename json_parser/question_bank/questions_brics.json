Enlargement to BRICS+ increases the pool of resources, projects and diplomatic outreach (bullet 1, bullet 4 timeline of expansion), which is likely to strengthen coordination and alternative finance channels in the near term; however, converting that into decisive leverage within long‑standing Bretton Woods governance structures is a gradual, resource‑ and coalition‑building process.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Fragmentation is a risk due to diverse interests, but the evidence of institutional steps (regular summitry, NDB, CRA) and the explicit outreach aim signpost coordination rather than collapse (see bullets 3, 5 and 6 on institutionalization and finance instruments).",

Currency unions require deep economic integration, legal frameworks and political convergence—none of which are immediate consequences of enlargement and are not part of BRICS’ stated toolkit (bullets 0 and 5).",

Requiring domestic ratification and using a phased status (such as partner/observer) until domestic procedures are complete balances respect for sovereignty with predictability.

Bullet 8 (Index 8) explicitly notes that adding sanctioned members increases pressure on global financial channels and creates incentives within BRICS to explore alternative payment and settlement systems and trade arrangements.

The cautious‑pilot posture aligns with India’s strategic autonomy and the risk‑management imperative: it allows technical exploration of reserve baskets/payments while protecting macro stability.

This option aligns with the cluster guidance that India should favour incremental institutionalisation and promote issue-based coalitions rather than grand centralisation (bullet 3 and 4).

This option integrates the chapter’s key themes: Russia promotes multipolarity and Global South representation (bullet points 0 and 1), seeks pragmatic financial alternatives without advocating immediate dollar abandonment (bullet point 2), supports outreach while cautioning against unfocussed universal enlargement (bullet point 4), and sometimes relies on high‑visibility symbolism that can outpace deliverables (bullet point 5). The result is strategic pragmatism accompanied by credibility risks.",

The chapter notes that while Russia uses symbolic imagery that can raise visibility (bullet point 5), Russian officials also emphasise pragmatic development of payment, settlement and reserve arrangements as preparedness rather than pure theatrics (bullet point 2). Thus the picture is not purely rhetorical.",
