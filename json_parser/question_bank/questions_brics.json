Enlargement to BRICS+ increases the pool of resources, projects and diplomatic outreach (bullet 1, bullet 4 timeline of expansion), which is likely to strengthen coordination and alternative finance channels in the near term; however, converting that into decisive leverage within long‑standing Bretton Woods governance structures is a gradual, resource‑ and coalition‑building process.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Fragmentation is a risk due to diverse interests, but the evidence of institutional steps (regular summitry, NDB, CRA) and the explicit outreach aim signpost coordination rather than collapse (see bullets 3, 5 and 6 on institutionalization and finance instruments).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Adoption of a single currency is a highly unlikely short‑term outcome. Currency unions require deep economic integration, legal frameworks and political convergence—none of which are immediate consequences of enlargement and are not part of BRICS’ stated toolkit (bullets 0 and 5).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While expansion raises BRICS’ political visibility, immediate coercive influence over World Bank/IMF governance is unlikely. Institutional change at Bretton Woods requires sustained capital and voting coalitions among major shareholders—factors that take time to build and are only partially addressed by enlargement (see bullet points 0 and 5 on aims and the NDB as an alternative)."

The CRA’s effectiveness is limited by reserve levels and activation rules (bullet 6); increasing capitalization and clarifying rules lowers frictions and political hesitation. The NDB’s impact depends on capitalization, project pipelines, governance parity, and cofinancing (bullet 5); strengthening these elements raises the bank’s ability to finance infrastructure credibly and at scale.",

Ad hoc bilateral swaps (liquidity lines) can help but are less reliable and predictable than a well‑capitalized, rule‑based CRA; restricting NDB lending to sovereign projects funded only from paid‑in capital ignores the utility of cofinancing and leverage which are essential for scaling projects (bullet 5).",

India therefore had to weigh the economic logic embedded in the label against strategic and institutional consequences as the analytic term acquired political life.",

Primakov’s multipolar concept (bullet 1) was an important geopolitical strand, but the cluster shows the tension arose because an investment label preceded and then intersected with geopolitical aims (bullets 0 and 2).

The most direct threat stems from portfolio growth outpacing capital augmentation: jump from ~US$15B to >US$32B in approvals (index 4) raises demands on balance-sheet capacity. Without realized increases in subscribed capital toward the US$100B target and effective use of callable capital/market borrowing (index 2 and index 3), the bank may face higher leverage and pressures on its credit standing.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Green projects (index 1) can have different risk-return profiles, but there is no clear evidence they inherently erode retained earnings to the point of threatening credit standing; the primary near-term risk is capital adequacy given growth (indexes 2–4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Geopolitical considerations linked to headquarters location (index 1) can create strategic challenges, but they are less directly tied to short-to-medium-term credit metrics than the mismatch between lending growth and capital/borrowing capacity (indexes 2 and 3).",

While membership expansion (index 6) changes governance dynamics, it does not in itself directly reduce creditworthiness; indeed, widening the shareholder base can strengthen capital prospects if new members subscribe capital.

The most fundamental challenge arises from the systems’ differing purposes and scopes: Pix is retail-focused (bullet 5), CIPS is tailored to RMB cross-border settlement (bullet 3), SPFS is a limited-reach Russian fallback (bullet 2), and SFMS is primarily domestic interbank messaging (bullet 4). These functional and currency specialisation differences — combined with differing correspondent networks and clearing roles — make reconciling consistent clearing and settlement behavior across an interconnected BRICS architecture especially difficult (bullets 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).",

Legal and sanction exposures are significant (bullet 1), but removing all political/jurisdictional risk through treaties is politically unlikely and addresses a separate dimension.

The point is facilitation of collective statements, not institutional weakening as the main intent.",
