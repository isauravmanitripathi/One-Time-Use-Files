Drawing on UNAIDS' mandate and institutional role, which approach best describes the programme's comparative advantage in this situation?",
              "options": [

UNAIDS was established as a joint UN programme to coordinate the international response to HIV/AIDS across public health, development and human rights domains (bullet 0) and, as a joint programme, it coordinates work of multiple UN agencies (notably WHO, UNICEF, UNDP) to align technical, normative and operational efforts in support of national responses (bullet 3). Its membership in the UN Development Group facilitates inter‑agency collaboration on cross‑cutting development and health issues (bullet 5), and its stated mission includes strengthening and supporting an expanded response—implying convening and coordination rather than direct service replacement (bullet 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. High-level advocacy and global targets are part of UNAIDS’ role, but remaining at the global visibility level while not engaging in operational alignment contradicts its mission to support an expanded and coordinated response and to align UN agency efforts at country level (bullets 1, 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Providing only targeted funding without coordination would fail to address the multisectoral nature of the epidemic. UNAIDS’ mandate emphasises multisectoral mechanisms and aligning UN system efforts rather than leaving coordination solely to donors and NGOs (bullets 0, 3, 5).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While service delivery is important, UNAIDS’ comparative advantage is coordination, advocacy and policy leadership rather than running large-scale direct service delivery; direct replacement of national services is not its typical operational role (bullets 0, 3)."

Civil-society engagement (bullet 6/index 5) is essential to reach migrants and marginalized groups who are often hard to access through government channels. Resource mobilization (bullet 7/index 6) ensures funds and programmatic inputs for rapid response, while high-level political leadership and inter-ministerial coordination (bullet 3/index 2 and the framing in bullet 1/index 0) provide the policy leverage and national-security framing necessary for cross-sectoral action. Strengthened M&E (bullet 5/index 4) allows real-time course correction and transparent reporting to reduce misinformation and maintain public confidence.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Legal and normative reforms and diplomacy (leadership/advocacy in bullet 3/index 2) are important for long-term stigma reduction and projecting normative leadership (bullet 0/index 0), but they are insufficient for immediate outbreak control. They must be combined with surveillance, service delivery and resource mobilization to manage acute public-health and security risks (bullets 3, 4 and 7).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While ART procurement and lab capacity are crucial (core technical roles in bullet 2/index 1 and lab networks in bullet 3/index 3), focusing only on supply-side expansion ignores the need for targeted surveillance, community outreach and political coordination. Without civil-society outreach the response may fail to reach migrants; without M&E and modelling, resource allocation may be inefficient (bullet 3/index 3; bullet 5/index 4).",

Increasing domestic funding and integrating with UHC (bullet 7/index 6) supports fiscal sustainability, but delaying targeted surveillance and outreach risks uncontrolled transmission in migrant corridors.

Biomedical prevention and treatment are essential, but UNAIDS operationalizes its mission through four interlinked components—preventing transmission; providing care and support; reducing vulnerability; and alleviating social, economic and health impacts (bullet 1). Focusing solely on biomedical measures neglects vulnerability and socioeconomic drivers that can undermine sustained epidemic control (bullet 2).",

UNAIDS explicitly advocates an expanded, comprehensive response that combines prevention, care/support, reducing vulnerability and alleviating social/economic impacts (bullet 1). Preventing escalation into a more severe/global pandemic is a repeatedly emphasised objective (bullet 2), and rights-based community engagement is part of UNAIDS’ emphasis on combining technical response with advocacy for human rights (bullet 6). Integrating these elements addresses both immediate transmission and the underlying determinants that can drive escalation.",

Networks such as GNP+ and other civil society actors played a crucial policy‑entrepreneur role, pressuring governments and international bodies to prioritize funding, rights and access (bullet 8). At the same time some countries (for example India) had already established national programmes before the UN programme was launched, demonstrating how domestic mobilisation and policy innovation can precede and enable international coordination (bullet 11).

This option succinctly captures the synthesis: UNAIDS' mixed roster demonstrates how soft power can produce practical public‑health gains (awareness, destigmatization, mobilisation), but India must recognise strategic stakes when transnational advocacy intersects with domestic policy and must cultivate and govern ambassadorial engagement to ensure substantive outcomes (Bullet Points 11 and 10).",

                "2": "Incorrect. Reducing the model to fundraising ignores its broader roles in destigmatization, normative leadership and diplomatic reach (Bullet Points 11 and 10). Fundraising is a component but not the sole purpose; India should assess multiple impact dimensions.",
                "3": "Incorrect. This overstates the efficacy of celebrity visibility. Bullet Point 11 explicitly notes the lesson is twofold: while the roster produces awareness and mobilisation, symbolic visibility alone is insufficient without governance and alignment to substantive goals."
