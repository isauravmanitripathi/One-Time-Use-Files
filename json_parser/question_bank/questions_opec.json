This conflicts with the coordinating purpose described in bullet 0 and worsens the enforcement limitations highlighted in bullet 5.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Transferring ownership of national oil companies to a central OPEC authority is impractical and politically implausible given members’ insistence on sovereignty over natural resources (historically emphasised in bullet 2). It also goes far beyond OPEC’s institutional remit (bullets 3 and 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Establishing a legally binding supranational enforcement body would run counter to OPEC’s nature and history. Bullet 4 shows policy is implemented through ministerial conferences and committees, and bullet 5 emphasises that enforcement relies on political pressure and market monitoring rather than binding sanctions. Creating a supranational authority would require ceding sovereignty that members have historically been reluctant to do.",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet 5 explains that enforcement in practice relies on market monitoring and political pressure; strengthening independent monitoring and transparency reduces information asymmetries and makes political incentives more effective. This approach fits within OPEC’s existing governance tools (ministerial conferences, technical committees — bullet 3) and leverages its principal instrument — coordinated production management (bullet 0) — without demanding supranational sanctions."

Without credible penalties, incentives to defect remain strong.",
                "1": "Correct. The cartel problem described (bullet 6) is a classic prisoner’s dilemma: members benefit individually from cheating. Weak enforcement (bullet 7) has historically left quotas unenforced. Transparent monitoring plus credible, graduated penalties creates the institutional credibility needed to align individual incentives with the collective logic of restricting supply (bullet 5) and reduces uncertainty about unilateral action (bullet 4 and 5). This addresses the core enforcement weakness within a state‑centered cartel (bullet 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Compensating compliant members might mitigate losses but creates complex side‑payments and requires an enforcement mechanism to collect from cheaters; it can be gamed and may still fail to change immediate profit incentives to cheat (bullet 6). Without monitoring and credible sanctions the scheme is vulnerable to abuse (bullet 7).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Bilateral import guarantees by buyers may reduce importer vulnerability but do not change internal supply incentives within OPEC. They could even undermine collective discipline by enabling individual members to form side deals, exacerbating cheating (contrary to the collective logic in bullet 5)."

While military intervention did occur in the pre‑OPEC era (e.g., 1953 Iran; bullet 3), the rise of OPEC did not primarily produce a new wave of successful military reversals of nationalization.

OPEC’s coordinated policy stance in the 1960s–70s gave producing states collective leverage against the Seven Sisters (bullet 2), addressing the pre‑OPEC punitive environment where unilateral nationalizations faced military and economic reprisals (bullet 3). By pooling bargaining power (bullet 5) and reducing the likelihood that any one state would bear the full cost of confrontation, nationalization became a more viable policy across the Middle East, North Africa and parts of Latin America (bullet 1 and 2)."

                "2": "Correct. The immediate price peak of 1979–1980 resulted from two linked Middle East disruptions — the Iranian Revolution and the Iran–Iraq War — which reduced effective regional supply and heightened geopolitical risk, driving nominal prices toward roughly US$40/barrel at the 1980 peak (bullet 1).

While coordination with non‑OPEC producers later became relevant, in late 2014 Al‑Naimi’s public stance was not to pursue an immediate new alliance while keeping Saudi production steady; his rationale focused on disciplining higher‑cost producers rather than external alliance building (bullet 7).",

While Vision 2030 (bullet 6) requires Saudi officials to manage long-term diversification, that program does not imply a preference for lower prices; in fact, Saudi fiscal needs and protecting investment returns typically favor price stability or higher prices.

The unanimity requirement of the five founding states (Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela) plus a three‑quarter supermajority gives the founders effective veto power over expansion.

                "2": "Correct. The strong geographic concentration of reserves in the Middle East (about 67% of OPEC’s proved reserves) coupled with OPEC’s large share of global reserves (≈79%) means that disruptions or policy choices in that region can have outsized effects on global supply and prices.
