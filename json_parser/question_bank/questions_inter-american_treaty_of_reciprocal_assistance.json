The Treaty mandates consultation among American states as the first step (bullet point 4); it does not require prior Security Council involvement.",
                "2": "Correct. TIAR’s central legal mechanic is a consultative obligation: parties must treat an armed attack or serious threat to a party as a matter of collective concern and consult on appropriate measures (bullet point 4). The Treaty expressly avoids imposing an automatic military commitment, leaving enforcement actions to subsequent political decisions by parties (bullet point 5). This makes consultation and collective decision‑making the immediate legal duty.",

Seeking bilateral guarantees from European powers would be impractical in 1944 (Europe was still at war) and would contradict the hemisphere‑wide focus of Latin American diplomacy.

Historically, Latin American exclusion from Dumbarton Oaks (Bullet 4) prompted diplomatic protest (e.g., Brazil) and Mexican initiative, producing the Chapultepec conference (Bullet 5).

The Rio Treaty did have institutional forums (like the OAS and Meeting of Consultation), but the tension arose from how those institutions were used and whether states trusted Washington—so the lack of formal forums oversimplifies the causes.
