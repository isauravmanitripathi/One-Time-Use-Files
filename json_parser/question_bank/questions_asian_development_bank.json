This explanation reflects the core reason for the adaptation finance gap noted in ADB’s report (bullet 4): adaptation often generates diffuse, localized and public‑good benefits (e.g., coastal resilience, water management) that do not produce clear revenue streams for private investors.

Basic votes do raise the floor for every member’s voice, but they are identical for all members and relatively small compared with share votes; relying solely on basic votes will not achieve parity with large capital contributors. Instead, basic votes are best leveraged collectively via coalitions of many small members (Bullets 1 and 4).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While share votes are proportional to subscribed capital, the ADB’s mixed formula (basic + share votes) means that marginal increases in capital yield diminishing returns to formal voting influence, especially for already large contributors (they typically have vote-to-capital ratios < 1). Large capital increases are also fiscally costly and do not guarantee proportional voting power (Bullets 1, 1, 4, 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Leadership positions (presidency, boards) do confer informal agenda-setting power, but they do not substitute for formal votes. Securing such posts is also politically challenging and not a reliable or sufficient route to block or carry votes; influence is most sustainable when combined with coalition-building and voting alliances (Bullet 6).",
                "3": "Correct. Because the ADB requires coalition-building for most decisions (no single member or pair holds a majority) and small members collectively enjoy amplified voting weight due to basic votes, a middle-sized member can maximize influence by forming and leading coalitions of smaller members. This leverages the aggregate voting power of those whose vote-to-capital ratios exceed 1 and aligns with the institutional reality that coalition-building, agenda-setting and alliances are central to decision-making (Bullets 1, 3, 4, 5, 6)."
