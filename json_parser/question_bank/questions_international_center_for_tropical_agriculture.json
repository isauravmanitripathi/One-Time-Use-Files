                "1": "Why incorrect: While farmer adoption is a factor, the statement is overly deterministic. Resistance to new technologies is situation-dependent. The core issue for the Alliance is aligning interventions with agrobiodiversity and landscape contexts, not universal farmer rejection.",

While CIAT’s ex situ collections (over 65,000 accessions and with Future Seeds raising capacity to 250,000) are crucial for biodiversity preservation and breeding raw material (bullets 0 and 1), ex situ conservation does not maintain the dynamic evolutionary processes and farmer selection that generate locally adapted traits. Hence relying mainly on ex situ holdings neglects in‑situ adaptation and social processes critical for long‑term resilience.",

Physical conservation alone does not remove socio‑economic barriers—such as extension, market incentives, and seed distribution—that determine whether smallholders can access and adopt improved germplasm. CIAT’s role includes providing material, but socio‑economic interventions are needed to translate genetic resources into livelihoods (bullets 1 and 2).",

Breeding requires evaluation, crossing, local testing and seed systems to deliver adapted varieties; ex situ collections are raw material but not a substitute for active breeding infrastructure.",

A large inventory is an insurance against genetic loss (bullet 1), but it does not guarantee immediate food security during crises unless germplasm can be rapidly multiplied, distributed, and accepted by farmers.

Strategic conservation commonly prioritizes under‑represented or high‑risk taxa and those with outsized importance for vulnerable populations. CIAT’s mission emphasizes providing breeding raw material and insurance against erosion (bullet 1), which suggests targeted as well as balanced investments rather than strict equality.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Tropical forages are important for livestock systems and livelihoods (approx. 23,000 accessions, bullet 1), but the argument for exclusive prioritization is weak. Importance should be balanced against representation gaps and food security urgency; exclusive focus on forages would neglect staple crops critical to smallholder diets.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although common bean has the most accessions (approx. 37,000, bullet 1) and remains vital for breeding, higher absolute numbers do not necessarily imply the highest marginal benefit from further investment. The existence of many accessions may reflect duplication; targeting under‑represented but high‑value crops like cassava can yield larger risk‑reduction benefits.",

This option synthesizes key insights: CIAT’s conserved diversity underpins food/nutrition and feed security (Bullet 1) and collaboration with CGIAR gene banks brings benefits (germplasm access, joint research) but requires calibrated ABS and safeguarding policies to preserve domestic benefit and biosecurity (Bullet 2).

                "0": "Incorrect. While international centers can have vulnerabilities, the cluster emphasizes diversified engagement rather than withdrawal. Sole domestic investment increases risks of missing global diversity and collaborative research benefits (bullets 12 and 14).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Banning imports and collaborations is extreme and counterproductive; the cluster warns about geopolitical risks but recommends diversified partnerships and funding to hedge those risks, not isolation (bullets 12 and 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Germplasm governance is central to breeding and resilience; the claim that it does not affect food security contradicts the premise of the cluster, which treats gene banks and germplasm governance as essential global public goods (bullets 12 and 14).",
                "3": "Correct. This critique aligns with the ‘Future Seeds’ model recommending that being both partner and funder strengthens influence and secures technical access (bullet 12), and with the policy takeaways that call for domestic duplication but also proactive engagement with global gene banks (bullet 14). A combined strategy mitigates continuity risks and preserves access to global genetic diversity."
