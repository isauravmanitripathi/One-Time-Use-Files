This sequence follows the actionable next steps and recommendations (Bullet 14 and 13): start with a verification exercise to collect complete metadata, produce a searchable master table and GIS layer, then define a role matrix aligning stations to strategic functions, and finally use standardized records to plan regional exercises.

While military logistics can help during crises, the bullet argues that non-military threats are best mitigated by scientific and institutional capacity distributed across regions.
