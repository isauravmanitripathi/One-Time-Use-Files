This option synthesizes the key causal elements identified in the case: the idea originated in 1890 (seed) but major international disruptions (two world wars, Great Depression), shifting inter‑American relations, decolonization and Cold War dynamics delayed realization; the proximate conversion into an institution required both a timely geopolitical window and political entrepreneurship from national leaders (e.g., President Juscelino Kubitschek) to operationalize the bank (see bullets 1 and 2 and 3).",
                "1": "Incorrect. This overstates external coercion. The proximate impetus came from regional national leadership (Kubitschek) and regional consensus, not simply superpower pressure; moreover the region’s shifting affinities mattered but the explanation is incomplete (see bullet 3 and 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While technical capacity and finance matter, the historical account emphasizes that technocratic readiness alone did not produce the IDB; political entrepreneurship and a favorable geopolitical moment were decisive (see bullets 2 and 3).",
                "3": "Incorrect. A regional organization—the OAS—already existed and in fact played a central legal and organizational role in forging the IDB’s Articles of Agreement; the problem was not the absence of a regional body but the alignment of politics and timing (see bullet 4)."

While the IDB’s affiliates can make equity investments (bullet 4), relying solely on market mechanisms to deliver social inclusion and institutional strengthening ignores the Bank’s large non‑financial role (bullet 5) and convening function (bullet 6). Market investment alone is unlikely to address institutional weaknesses or design targeted social programs without technical assistance and policy dialogue (bullets 3 and 5).",

This option reflects the IDB’s blended operational model: providing sovereign lending for large physical investments (bullet 4) while coupling financing with non‑financial support—technical cooperation and capacity building—to design and implement social and institutional reforms (bullets 5 and 3). The IDB’s convening role helps coordinate ministries, multilateral partners and private investors for regional or cross‑border spillovers and ensures coherence (bullet 6). This integrated approach aligns with the Bank’s evolution from narrow infrastructure lending to a broader portfolio balancing physical investments, social inclusion and institutional reform (bullet 3).",

Guarantees are part of the IDB’s toolkit (bullet 4) and can mobilize private capital, but imposing strict fiscal consolidation as the primary condition and leaving social programs unfunded neglects the Bank’s practice of combining finance with technical assistance and policy advice (bullets 5 and 3).

This option reflects the cluster’s points: IDB’s operational outputs show both large sovereign‑guaranteed lending (US$12.7 billion approvals in 2023) and substantial private mobilization (US$5.3 billion in 2023) (Index 8). The 2024 sustainability metrics show high percentages across instruments (Index 9), but mobilizing private funds scales impact while adding complexity in risk allocation, pricing and oversight (Index 11). The key operational challenge is reconciling these demands to deliver measurable sustainability outcomes.",

Equalizing votes would strengthen formal regional control and ownership by borrowers (addressing the institutional division highlighted by the cartographic distinction).

Use MDB instruments (first‑loss tranches, partial credit guarantees, local‑currency facilities) to mobilize private capital into job‑rich sectors and to extend finance to small enterprises; 4. Strengthen domestic resource mobilization: modernize tax administration, broaden the tax base, and reduce evasion to expand fiscal space for social spending and strategic investments; 5. Build robust MEL systems within MDB‑supported programs to generate evidence on which instruments actually reduce poverty and enhance stability — disaggregated by region, gender, and vulnerable groups; 6. Pair regulatory easing with governance reforms (transparency, procurement, anti‑corruption) and enforceable environmental/social safeguards to minimize negative externalities; 7.
