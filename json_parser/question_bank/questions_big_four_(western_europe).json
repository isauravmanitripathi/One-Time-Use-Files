The technical focus is not sufficient to depoliticize the process.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The withdrawing state cannot unilaterally extend the Article 50 timetable or prolong transition indefinitely; extension requires unanimous agreement of all EU member states. Thus the government faces real time constraints that keep political debate and pressure on leadership active rather than removing it (bullet 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While Article 50 signals intent to leave, it does not automatically strengthen negotiating leverage. The two‑year default timeline (only extendable unanimously) can constrain the withdrawing state and create urgency, and domestic political divisions following a close referendum often weaken negotiating unity. Moreover, EU partners may exploit the limited timetable to extract concessions rather than simply accepting terms to preserve stability (bullets 0 and 1).",
                "3": "Correct. The sequence described (referendum → Article 50 → two‑year window → transition during which many EU rules still apply) matches the UK case. Maintaining EU rules in the transition reduces immediate legal/economic disruption but, because Article 50 sets a default two‑year negotiation window extendable only by unanimous member‑state agreement, it places time pressure on negotiators. That compression, combined with the narrow referendum margin and deep domestic divisions, tends to prolong domestic political debate and can trigger leadership changes or internal party conflict (bullets 0 and 1). This explains why bargaining space can be constrained even while short‑term stability is preserved."
