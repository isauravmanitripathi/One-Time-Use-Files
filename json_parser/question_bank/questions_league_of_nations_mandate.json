The mandate system legally framed administration as non‑annexatory (bullet 1), but there was no foolproof mechanism stopping administering powers from deriving long‑term political or economic benefits; several mandates, especially C‑class, were administered like colonies (bullets 5 and 7), and enforcement depended on political will (bullet 6).",

While Article 22 incorporated rhetoric of trusteeship and Wilsonian ideas of oversight (bullet 3 and 4), contemporaneous critiques note that the system did not reliably translate into rapid independence; many mandated territories experienced prolonged foreign administration (bullets 4 and 7). Treating the proposal as embodying only Wilsonian self‑determination overlooks the paternalism and political motives present (bullets 1, 3).",

The colonial resemblance cannot be attributed primarily to local resistance; rather it was due to the way mandatory powers exercised their authority within the hybrid legal framework.",

While some contemporaries and critics argued mandates were thinly veiled colonialism, the system was not simply a cosmetic rebranding; it had genuine international legal elements (Article 22, treaty obligations, League reporting and oversight) (bullet points 4 and 5). To say oversight was merely ceremonial overstates the case and ignores institutional mechanisms like mandatory reporting and PCIJ jurisdiction in some matters (bullet point 5).",

Similarly, C‑class mandates were often absorbed in practice rather than granted self‑government (bullet 5, 7).",

This option aligns with how mandates were classified and practised: B‑class mandates (largely former German African possessions) were considered less prepared and subject to more explicit administrative restrictions, often limiting political development (bullet 5). C‑class mandates (e.g., South West Africa and many Pacific islands) were treated as closely tied to the administering power’s territory and frequently administered in ways resembling colonial rule (bullet 5). League oversight via the Permanent Mandates Commission existed but its ability to curb such practices depended on the political will of powerful states (bullet 6), so the described outcomes are plausible (bullet 7)."

Embedding prior political pledges into a mandate (for example, the Palestine mandate embedding the 1917 Balfour Declaration) constrains the administering power to pursue specific national aims, which can institutionalise commitments favouring one community over others and thereby exacerbate nationalist tensions (bullet 6). The institutionalisation of such commitments under the League framework made them legally significant and politically contentious."

This option integrates the specific point that the Class B prohibition on bases represents an early attempt to decouple territorial control from basing rights (bullet 10) with the broader observation that the paternalistic framing and the gap between law and practice shaped newly independent states’ realist suspicions and insistence on sovereignty — positions India actively defended in the early UN era (bullets 9 and 11).
