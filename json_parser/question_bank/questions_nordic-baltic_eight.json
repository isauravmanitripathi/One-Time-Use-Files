                "1": "Correct. The NB8’s relatively high per‑capita income and concentrated institutional capacity (bullet points 2 and 3) together with strong governance indicators and regulatory quality (bullet point 4) enable resilience and policy agility. These attributes facilitate rapid intergovernmental coordination and the effective use of diplomatic, economic and administrative tools during security shocks. The NB8 also leverages overlapping institutional networks and alliance linkages (bullet point 6) to operationalize responses quickly.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Tourism revenues (bullet points 4 and 5) are economically significant but are neither the primary nor an immediate source of funding for defence cooperation. Defence and security responses rely more on institutional capacity, alliance commitments and government budgets than on tourism receipts.",

While there are linguistic commonalities within subgroups (North Germanic, Finnic, Baltic — bullet point 1), the NB8 is not unified by a single shared language across all members. Linguistic affinities underpin cultural flows in parts of the region but do not by themselves ensure coherent security policymaking."

The NB8’s strengths—high per‑capita GDP, strong governance, regulatory quality, innovation support and institutional performance (bullet points 2 and 3 and 4)—make niche multilateralism and targeted leadership (e.g., in climate, digital governance, Arctic policy) an effective way to magnify influence despite small population. This approach builds on institutional capacity and policy agility noted in the cluster.",

Finnic languages (Finnish and Estonian) are distinct within the NB8 (bullet point 1), and practical integration benefits from targeted bilateral cooperation (e.g., Finland–Estonia ties) combined with institutional backing from EU and NATO frameworks where applicable (bullet point 6).

The cluster describes a deliberate multichannel approach combining diplomacy (foreign ministers), parliamentary diplomacy (speakers and a parliamentary conference) and bureaucratic/political coordination (political directors).

The sequence mirrors the pattern described: foreign ministers voiced political support and EU encouragement in Valletta and triggered parliamentary engagement (bullets 3 and 4).

CBSS is an intergovernmental body with strengths in multilateral coordination across the broader Baltic Sea region (bullet 4), but it does not substitute for NB8 parliamentary legitimacy and the Nordic/Baltic parliamentary fora are important to secure domestic democratic buy‑in and legislative alignment (bullets 2, 3, 5, 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Implementing tools before parliamentary consensus risks democratic backlash, weak legitimacy and possible non‑ratification of enabling laws. This reverses the complementary roles described: parliamentary bodies provide legitimacy and shape positions, while governmental bodies deliver — sequencing matters for durability (bullet points 5, 6, 7).",
                "3": "Correct. This sequence uses parliamentary fora (Nordic Council and Baltic Assembly) to build democratic legitimacy, cross‑parliamentary consent and normative framing for enabling legislation, then leverages the intergovernmental Nordic Council of Ministers for programme design, budgeting and implementation. It reflects the critical institutional distinction (parliamentary bodies generate political traction and legitimacy; governmental bodies implement, fund and administrate) and the complementary roles necessary for durable cooperation (bullet points 5, 6 and 7; also bullets 1–4 for the specific institutions)."
