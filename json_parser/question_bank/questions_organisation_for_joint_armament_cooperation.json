A private consortium contracted individually by each state lacks the single programme executive role OCCAR provides (contracting on behalf of member states, lifecycle management and technical coordination). It would not ensure the institutional continuity and coherent long‑term sustainment OCCAR offers (Bullet Points 5, 6 and 7).",
                "2": "Incorrect. NATO can coordinate defence activities and logistics, but an integrated NATO procurement command with authority over national procurement would be inconsistent with the principle of states retaining sovereign control as practised by OCCAR (Bullet Point 3).",

While programme participation is possible without ratification, temporary full membership with voting rights is not the standard legal pathway.",

OCCAR’s two‑tier system allows participating states to join specific programmes and exercise programme‑level rights (bullet 5 and 6); they are not confined solely to observation. Thus option 3 understates the available avenue for substantive programme involvement.",
                "2": "Correct. OCCAR’s model is explicitly “programme‑first”: states with substantive involvement can participate at the programme level without acceding to the Convention (bullet 3). The organisation also maintains two tiers — full members (party to the Convention with voting rights) and participating states whose rights are limited to specific programmes (bullet 5). Examples (Turkey, Netherlands, etc.) show that states can have operational access without immediate ratification (bullet 6). Full voting rights require ratification and accession as a party to the Convention.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Industrial or financial contribution alone does not automatically confer OCCAR governance voting rights. OCCAR distinguishes programme participation from formal treaty party status; voting rights are a prerogative of full members (bullet 5) and accession requires ratification (bullet 3)."

Certification of the combined system is often the single most consequential bottleneck because it encompasses the safety, airworthiness and weapon‑release qualifications across multiple suppliers and the platform integrator (bullet 4).

While SSBNs and SSNs have different roles, AIP boats remain cost‑effective for congested waters; dismissing them fails to appreciate lifecycle upgradeability and industrial partnership potential (Bullet Point 9).",
                "1": "Incorrect. AIP diesel‑electric boats are not strategic nuclear deterrents; SSBNs provide strategic deterrence. AIP subs are optimized for stealthy littoral operations and sea‑denial, not nuclear strategic roles; nor should they replace unmanned and modular surface investments (Bullet Points 9, 7, 11).",
                "2": "Correct. This option recognises the U‑212 lesson: fuel‑cell AIP grants extended submerged endurance and low acoustic signature useful in littorals; India should pursue life‑cycle upgradeability (sensors, combat systems), industrial partnerships, and integrate subs into a layered approach that includes unmanned MCM and logistics—reflecting bullets on AIP advantages and cross‑cutting institutional lessons (Bullet Points 9, 7, 10, 11).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Even survivable platforms require robust life‑cycle support—spare parts, training, sustainment pipelines.
