                "Its headquarters in a prominent European city gives it political legitimacy and direct control over national river policies.",

While the Strasbourg headquarters links the Commission symbolically and practically to European institutions (bullet point 5), mere location in a European hub does not by itself explain institutional durability. Political legitimacy from location is secondary to the Commission’s technical, economically grounded mandate (bullet points 0 and 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. A small, connected membership contributes to effectiveness (bullet point 3), but the CCNR is not characterized by supranational authority that overrides national laws. Its durability stems from cooperative technical governance rather than legal supremacy over states (bullet point 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Multilingual practice is important for legal drafting and stakeholder engagement (bullet point 4), but multilingualism alone does not prevent political disputes. It facilitates inclusive procedures rather than being the primary cause of institutional endurance (bullet points 4 and 1).",
                "3": "Correct. This option captures the core of the argument: CCNR’s focus on technical regulation—safety and efficiency of navigation tied to shared economic interests—creates functional incentives for cooperation that persist across political regimes (bullet points 0 and 1). Technical rule‑making helps the Commission survive wars and regime changes because members prioritize stable commerce over transactional politics."

                "0": "Incorrect. Military or strategic importance can shape geopolitics, but the CCNR's inclusion of non‑riparians like Belgium was driven by economic and transport linkages rather than security concerns. Using security as the primary rationale risks militarizing a primarily regulatory, commercial institution (see bullets 0 and 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Historical treaties and dynastic links can matter in some contexts, but they do not provide the practical basis for contemporary membership where commercial interdependence is the determining factor. The CCNR evolved for practical navigational and commercial governance rather than purely historic ties (see bullets 0 and 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While riparian status is a traditional basis for membership, the CCNR example shows that non‑riparian actors with strong economic stakes (e.g., Belgium) have been granted formal roles because practical interests in navigation and commerce can outweigh a strict territorial rule. Relying only on riparian sovereignty would exclude important stakeholders and undermine regime effectiveness (see bullets 1 and 2).",
                "3": "Correct. The most persuasive justification is the material economic stake: a large fleet plus integrated port and canal networks mean that the state's trade competitiveness depends on the river's regulatory regime. The CCNR case of Belgium demonstrates how such economic presence translated into formal influence because rules on safety, locks, tariffs and traffic directly affected Belgian commerce (see bullets 2, 3 and 4)."

Divergent national standards may create competitive dynamics, but they tend to increase compliance and administrative costs for operators crossing borders, raising rather than lowering transaction costs.

This option synthesizes the CCNR’s core lesson: low‑politics technical bodies insulated from high politics, backed by treaty‑anchored legal frameworks and adaptive protocols, promote resilience, safety and economic security. However, great‑power politics can still reshape membership and authority, so institutional design must account for that vulnerability (Bullet points 1, 3, 4).",

Embedding membership criteria and amendment procedures at treaty level, together with neutral technical mandates and dispute settlement, reduces the likelihood that shifts in power alone will remake the commission’s authority while preserving its operational effectiveness (Bullet points 1, 3, 4).",
