                "2": "Correct. “Endorsed in principle” denotes political support but is not final admission.

This response reflects the balance between promoting regional integration (single trade bloc) and respecting state sovereignty (Bullets 0 and 6). Practical guidance also calls for verifying membership/suspension and following institutional processes rather than ad hoc measures (Bullet 4).",

While the UN can be involved in interstate matters, ECOWAS has its own legal and institutional mechanisms (Commission and Community Court of Justice) to address treaty breaches.

Using the Parliament as the primary enforcement mechanism would contravene the institutional roles set out in ECOWAS’s architecture (Bullet 6).",

Immediate military deployment would be disproportionate and inconsistent with ECOWAS’s normative emphasis on non‑aggression, democratic governance and rule‑based resolution of disputes.

The CFA franc’s euro peg is a monetary arrangement linked to institutional commitments and external arrangements, not an immediate consequence of a single state's AML/CFT deterioration.

Donors and investors typically respond to weakened AML/CFT by increasing conditionality or withdrawing to protect their own reputational and legal exposure; they do not immediately increase aid or investment.

Weak AML/CFT undermines confidence among international correspondent banks and correspondent-banking relationships, which often leads banks to de-risk or limit relationships with jurisdictions seen as high-risk.

                "0": "Incorrect. USD is a liquid currency but is not aligned with the XOF’s euro peg; denominating in dollars introduces an exchange‑rate mismatch relative to the region’s monetary anchor and can increase risk. Bullet Point 1 implies India should be mindful of the Franc Zone’s particular convertibility dynamics rather than defaulting to a generic global currency.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Denominating in INR prioritises India’s currency goals but creates significant currency mismatch and exposure for the borrower and local financial institutions, since XOF’s convertibility is tied to the euro. Bullet Point 1 flags these convertibility and systemic risks: using INR without robust hedging would transfer undue FX risk to partner countries and undermine project sustainability.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While denominating in XOF removes immediate transaction costs and is attractive for the borrower, doing so without hedging leaves India (and possibly the borrowing institution) exposed to systemic Franc Zone shocks and limits India’s ability to manage currency risk. Bullet Point 1 underlines the need to account for convertibility arrangements and systemic risks; absence of hedging or technical support ignores that guidance.",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet Point 1 emphasises that India must account for XOF convertibility arrangements and systemic Franc Zone risks in currency and financial risk management. Since the XOF is effectively pegged to the euro (and exposed to Franc Zone arrangements), denominating facilities in euros aligns with the currency anchor and reduces exchange‑rate friction for the borrower. Coupling this with explicit FX‑hedging support and capacity building for local banks addresses convertibility and systemic risks, consistent with the recommendation in Bullet Point 1 to target lines of credit and capacity‑building to strengthen financial risk management."

Bullet Point 1 explicitly links macroeconomic stability within UEMOA to political stability and therefore India’s security cooperation (counter‑piracy, counter‑terrorism, peacekeeping contributions, maritime security partnerships).
