The founding composition (bullet 2) explains the League’s initial membership base and diversity, but diversity alone does not explain deliberate institutional protections against integration.

The Charter entrenched state sovereignty/non‑interference and allocated one vote per state (bullet 4 and 5). Coupled with a culture of consensus and procedural rules that allow single states effective blocking power (bullet 5 and 6), these features let rulers publicly endorse Arab unity while structurally preventing supranational commitments that could constrain their domestic authority (bullet 6 and 7).",

While the Secretariat’s headquarters in Cairo (bullet 1) was the League’s institutional home and focal point for meetings, its location does not by itself explain why rulers engineered rules to prevent deeper integration. The centralisation of administrative functions did not grant coercive authority nor prevent blocking—the Charter’s procedural protections did (bullets 3–6)."

The League does have economic institutions (e.g., the Arab Monetary Fund) (Bullet Point 5), but lack of a financing vehicle is not the primary legal or political reason sanctions are hard to enforce.

The one‑state one‑vote rule and a culture of consensus, reinforced by the Charter’s emphasis on sovereignty and non‑interference (bullets 3, 4 and 5), most directly enable a single member to prevent collective enforcement. The League’s decision rules and absence of supranational enforcement mean that implementation depends on member consent (bullet 5), allowing procedural blocking."

The League is transregional, straddling Africa and West Asia with ten African members (Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Somalia, Sudan, Tunisia) and remaining members in West Asia/Arabian Peninsula (Bullet 5). This composition makes it necessary for the League to manage a transregional agenda that includes Mediterranean politics, Nile basin water issues, Sahel security and Gulf maritime matters (Bullet 5), so a balanced, transregional approach best fits institutional needs.",

Treating African members’ problems as primarily bilateral or sub‑regional ignores the League’s role in coordinating Arab states across continents and the fact that many issues (water, security, migration) cross national borders and retrace colonial and post‑colonial patterns of interdependence (Bullet 4, Bullet 5).",

Focusing exclusively on Gulf maritime issues would neglect the League’s significant African membership (ten of 22 members—Bullet 5) and the multiple regional intersections that the League routinely confronts (Bullet 5). Such a narrow posture would be mismatched to membership geography."

Non‑Arab observers typically seek access to diplomatic dialogue, platforms for economic and trade ties, diaspora engagement and cooperation on security matters—these are realistic immediate benefits (bullet 11). The realistic limitation is that observers cannot vote and the League itself has limited authority to make resolutions binding or enforce compliance (bullets 10 and 9).",

Observers are not automatically entitled to chair specialised committees—chairs are normally drawn from member states and committee arrangements reflect the League’s institutional rules (bullet 7).

The League was designed to resolve intra‑Arab disputes without external intervention (bullet point 1), but its founding instruments did not categorically ban collective action; rather, they combined supra‑national organs with strong protection of sovereignty (bullet point 2 and 3). The restriction is political and procedural, not an absolute legal prohibition.",

Domestic political drivers—ruling elites prioritising regime security and foreign policy autonomy—reduce incentives to cede authority (bullet point 6).

A wholesale transformation into a supranational body with compulsory enforcement would require deep constitutional changes and broad political will beyond a limited willingness to delegate authority.
