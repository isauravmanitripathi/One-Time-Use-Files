It is an overly blunt instrument that harms participants and delays innovation without guaranteeing resolution of geopolitical issues.",

Bullet 0 describes Eureka as a market‑oriented R&D network whose membership has selectively globalised; bullet 3 notes the practical effect of membership changes (Russia’s exit) on counts and projects. Strengthening institutional safeguards and diversifying partners (including utilising associated members listed in bullet 2) is a pragmatic, continuity‑preserving approach that reduces single‑point geopolitical vulnerability while keeping the network operational.",
                "2": "Incorrect — While associated countries (bullet 2) can help broaden partnerships, relying entirely on them is impractical: associated members are fewer (bullet 3), their status is different from full membership (bullet 2), and they cannot immediately substitute the depth of engagement or capacities of many existing full members (bullet 1). Diversification should be complementary, not wholesale replacement.",

The organisation deliberately expanded in waves (bullet 0) and includes many non‑Western and non‑European members (bullet 1 and 2). Such retrenchment would sacrifice the collaborative and market benefits that motivated expansion and would not necessarily eliminate geopolitical risk."
