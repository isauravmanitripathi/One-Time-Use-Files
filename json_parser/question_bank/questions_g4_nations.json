Forming an alternative security organization might increase the G4’s regional influence, but it would not compel the UN to recognize new permanent members and could fragment global security governance. This course undermines the G4’s stated aim of securing formal recognition within the UNSC framework (Bullets 1, 2) and bypasses, rather than resolves, the Charter’s legal constraints (Bullet 0).",
                "1": "Correct. The UN Charter makes formal change difficult because any amendment requires either ratification by all five P5 or sufficiently broad support that effectively neutralizes them (Bullet 0). Given this legal obstacle, the most viable non‑amendment route is to build overwhelming General Assembly backing and secure at least political acquiescence or non‑obstruction from P5 states. This leverages the G4’s sustained presence and legitimacy (Bullets 1, 4, 5) to create a political environment in which P5 are less willing to exercise veto against reform.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Increasing frequency of non‑permanent occupancy strengthens the G4’s political legitimacy (Bullets 3, 4, 5) but does not remove the formal legal barrier posed by the Charter. Non‑permanent seats are regionally allocated and limited to two‑year terms (Bullet 3), so this tactic alone cannot create a legally recognized permanent membership without addressing P5 consent or a Charter amendment (Bullet 0).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Economic coercion against P5 states is neither feasible nor likely to succeed—P5 are major powers with substantial resilience and counter‑leverage. Moreover, such coercion would damage the G4’s claim to be constructive stakeholders in international governance (Bullets 1, 2) and would likely harden P5 resistance, making Charter amendment even less attainable (Bullet 0)."

While the G4 is indeed a tactical coalition focused on UNSC seats rather than a broad economic/political alliance like the G7 (bullet 0), that fact alone does not explain the procedural impossibility. The core barriers are legal (Charter amendment requirements) and political opposition, not merely lobbying capacity.",

Article 108 (UN Charter) requires amendment adoption by a two‑thirds GA majority and ratification by two‑thirds of members, including all five P5 — a legal hurdle that effectively gives P5 veto power over expansion. Politically, organized opposition such as the Uniting for Consensus (led by Italy) and regional rivals who view individual G4 aspirants as competitors or security threats (especially around India and Japan) create further obstacles. (Sources: bullet points 4 and 5; contextualized by bullets 0 and 1.)",

This is factually inaccurate: each G4 member has repeatedly served as an elected non‑permanent member and has made significant UN contributions (e.g., India’s large troop contributions; Germany and Japan’s financial contributions). Thus lack of prior service or contributions is not the principal problem. (Counters bullet points 1 and 2/3.)"

                "1": "Correct. The G4 can legitimately point to extensive service (Bullets 4 and 5) to claim capability and legitimacy (Bullet 1), but legal change of Council composition is governed by the UN Charter and effectively constrained by the P5 veto/rats requirement (Bullet 0).

The Charter’s current structure reflects post‑World War II realities, which is why the original P5 are permanent (Bullet 0), but there is no explicit Charter clause that limits permanent membership only to WWII victors in absolute terms; rather, amending membership requires the process noted in the Charter. The G4’s argument focuses on contemporary legitimacy (Bullet 1), not a literal reading that excludes them by default.",
