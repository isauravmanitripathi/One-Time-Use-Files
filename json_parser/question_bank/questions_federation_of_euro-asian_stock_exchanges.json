While a bilateral relationship with a large exchange might bring liquidity or immediate access (a short‑term benefit), it does not offer the institutional breadth (post‑trade bodies, brokers’ associations, regional federations) that FEAS provides for systemic development (bullet 3). The question asks for the most compelling reason to prefer FEAS — systemic institution‑building outweighs one‑off liquidity gains.",
                "1": "Incorrect. There is no indication that FEAS imposes a single currency or that the secretariat’s location in Yerevan implies regulatory takeover (bullet 5). FEAS is an international non‑profit federation with regional focus and openness to international members (bullet 4); membership is about cooperation and capacity, not ceding monetary or regulatory sovereignty.",

As a non‑profit federation aimed at promoting cooperation and development across Eurasia (bullet 0 and 4), FEAS is designed to support the entire market ecosystem — from trade execution through post‑trade infrastructure — which is more suitable for comprehensive capacity building than a single bilateral deal focused mainly on cross‑listing or liquidity.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Membership of FEAS is not merely symbolic: the federation’s purpose is explicit promotion, support and development of capital markets across Eurasia (bullet 0), and it includes practical actors such as clearing/settlement entities and brokers’ associations (bullet 3). While domestic reforms are necessary, FEAS membership complements—not substitutes—those reforms through technical cooperation and regional standards."

Better to harmonise standards than restrict membership.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Bilateral liquidity agreements can improve market liquidity but do not resolve settlement risk arising from mismatched post‑trade rules or incompatible technical standards. Since FEAS’s membership composition emphasises post‑trade entities (bullet 3), solutions should engage those institutions directly.",
                "2": "Incorrect. A centralised trading platform might help execution but, if post‑trade processes remain dissimilar across jurisdictions, settlement risk persists. FEAS’s strength lies in its inclusion of post‑trade actors (bullet 3), so leaving those unchanged would be insufficient.",

Because FEAS explicitly includes clearing and settlement bodies (bullet 2 and 3), harmonising post‑trade standards and creating mutual recognition will directly address settlement risk across borders by aligning procedures, messaging standards, and cross‑border legal frameworks, thereby strengthening the entire trade‑to‑post‑trade ecosystem."

Bullet 5 notes the headquarters in Yerevan is of political and practical significance, highlighting Armenia’s ambition as a regional cooperation hub positioned between larger actors.
