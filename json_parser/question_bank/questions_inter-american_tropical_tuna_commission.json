Pushing for non-government actors to have direct votes would conflict with the Commission’s established governance and is unlikely to be a practical or immediate avenue for influence.",
                "1": "Correct. The IATTC was established as a treaty-based body to manage highly migratory tuna using a scientific basis (Bullet 0). Each member appoints Commissioners who make political decisions guided by the Commission’s scientific staff (Bullet 3 and Bullet 4). Therefore, investing in scientific capacity, collaborating with the IATTC scientific staff, and ensuring Commissioners are aligned with evidence-based management is the most effective, institutionally consistent route to influence.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Bilateral arrangements outside the IATTC risk undermining the multilateral, science-based management regime the Commission was created to provide (Bullet 0 and Bullet 2). Such an approach could isolate the state from collective decision-making and is inconsistent with the Commission’s design to admit coastal and distant-water states into a common management framework (Bullet 1 and Bullet 2).",

Relocating the secretariat is an extreme measure that does not align with how the Commission was designed to function; its headquarters in La Jolla were chosen to leverage proximity to major U.S. research institutions (Bullet 4). Even if achieved, relocation would not by itself guarantee sustained influence in scientific advice or Commissioner decisions."

The IATTC framework expects coordinated measures to manage shared stocks (bullets 0, 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Informal agreements may be quicker but lack the binding legal character of Commission resolutions and may not cover all flag states or high‑seas fishing, reducing effectiveness for shared stocks that range beyond a single state’s jurisdiction (bullets 0, 1, 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Scientific advice is essential, but relying only on advisory outputs without translating them into formal Commission measures and domestic law delays enforceable action.

The IATTC is a regional RFMO established under the 1949 Convention; its conservation measures derive legal effect through binding resolutions adopted by the Commission which members are expected to transpose into domestic law.

A pragmatic response that preserves scientific effectiveness is to build formal regional partnerships and capacity so coastal-state institutions can engage directly with the IATTC’s scientific staff and benefit from data exchange—addressing perceptions of imbalance without disrupting the Commission’s science-based mandate (Bullet 0 and Bullet 4).",

                "0": "Incorrect. Asymmetries have concrete operational effects—limitations in monitoring, enforcement and compliance—not merely ideological differences (Bullet Point 1). Mere normative leadership without technical or capacity contributions will have limited impact (Bullet Point 2 emphasises technical credibility and tangible capability).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While DWFNs may possess advanced fleets, the statement that they will adhere to norms overlooks incentives for IUU fishing in complex supply chains (Bullet Point 1). Naval diplomacy alone is expensive and limited in scope across the high seas; the IATTC example stresses cooperation and shared tools rather than unilateral enforcement (Bullet Point 2).",
                "2": "Correct. Bullet Point 1 highlights governance asymmetries—differences in capacity, economic dependence and negotiating power—which hinder enforcement. The practical mitigation, consistent with Bullet Point 2, is capacity‑building for coastal States and collaborative MCS mechanisms (shared surveillance, observer schemes, data exchange) within RFMOs, enabling collective enforcement and reducing opportunities for IUU exploitation.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Unilateral blacklists can be counterproductive and difficult to enforce legally on the high seas; the IATTC approach emphasizes multilateral, science‑based, cooperative tools (Bullet Points 1 and 2).

This option synthesises the IATTC lessons: technical credibility via science and observer presence, negotiating leverage through a credible secretariat role, adaptive measures to respond to shifting stocks, and capacity building to reduce governance asymmetries (Bullets 1 and 2). These measures collectively address both IUU and climate-driven mobility while enhancing India's leadership and compliance capabilities.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Socio‑economic programmes are important for resilience but insufficient by themselves to tackle IUU or the governance challenges posed by mobile stocks (Bullet Points 1 and 2). Minimal engagement in negotiations forfeits influence to shape adaptive, science‑based RFMO rules.",

Lacking investment in research and regional capacity undermines legitimacy and effectiveness (Bullet Point 2 stresses technical credibility and cooperative responses).",

Bullet Point 2 emphasises technical credibility and norm diffusion—science underpins rule‑making, supports adaptive management for shifting stocks, and strengthens legitimacy and cooperation. A balanced approach that combines technology, science, and diplomacy is therefore the strongest critique of the proposition.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While costs matter, technology is not always cheaper when deployed at scale and without cooperative frameworks; furthermore, cost‑effective long‑term solutions rely on science, shared MCS, and capacity building to handle climate-driven mobility and governance asymmetries highlighted in the IATTC case (Bullets 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Scientific credibility is highly relevant: robust data informs management measures, helps attribute compliance or non‑compliance, and underpins negotiations and legitimacy (Bullet Point 2). Data can deter IUU indirectly by enabling evidence‑based sanctions and cooperative measures (contrary to the option’s claim).",

The assertion that norm diffusion is only for wealthy States ignores the cooperative nature of high‑seas governance in which pooled norms and shared rules reduce enforcement costs and limit free‑riding (Bullet Points 1 and 2).
