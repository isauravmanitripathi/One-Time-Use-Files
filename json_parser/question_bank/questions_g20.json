That backlash could undermine the strategy.",

While exclusive reliance on PPP can obscure nominal external financing realities (a valid caution), the question asks for 'a key analytical risk' tied to G20 communiqués as described in the bullets.

G20 practice has been to invite the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU in its institutional capacity—e.g., Czech premiers attended in 2009 as the Council presidency rather than as Czech national leaders—reflecting the G20’s sensitivity to modes of institutional representation (bullet 8).",

The cluster explains that after 2008 the G20 assumed central coordinating functions in the global economic response, raising questions of democratic representation and legitimacy.
