The EPC was proposed and operationalised quickly as a continental, summit‑style space for broad political consultation that explicitly invites EU and non‑EU states (bullets 0, 2 and 3).

                "1": "Incorrect. The OSCE is an older pan‑European organisation with a broad security and co‑operation mandate, but it does not match the specific purpose, rapid political mobilisation and recent consensual creation the EPC represents following the 2022 crisis. Also, the OSCE’s mechanisms are not framed as the EPC’s model of high‑level, time‑bound political coordination created in direct response to the 2022 invasion (bullets 3, 4). The OSCE’s commitments are generally politically binding, but it is not the newly established rapid political forum described in the cluster (bullets 0–6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. NATO is a military alliance focused on collective defence and military‑political cooperation among its members. While NATO conducts political consultations, it is not designed as a broad pan‑European political forum meant to include many non‑NATO European states for soft‑law political statements; its remit is primarily defence‑oriented rather than a general political dialogue platform (bullets 0, 2, 3).",

The EPC was created as an intergovernmental forum to provide a high‑level, inclusive platform for political and strategic discussion across a wide European constituency (bullets 0, 1, 2). It is explicitly designed to operate through consultation, coordination and political statements rather than producing binding legislation, making it suitable for rapid, cross‑border political responses that include both EU and non‑EU states (bullets 0, 2, 5). The EPC’s inaugural summit in Prague (October 2022) and attendance by 44 countries demonstrate its convening capacity and inclusivity (bullets 4, 5).

The core institutional challenge emphasised in the source material concerns inter‑institutional relationships, not just funding.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While national sovereignty is a general concern, the most immediate institutional problem from institutionalisation is overlap with existing pan‑European bodies rather than direct constitutional crises within member states. Bullet point 6 explicitly flags the relationship with existing bodies (EU, NATO, Council of Europe) as a principal question.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The EPC was designed to be inclusive of both EU and non‑EU states (bullets 2 and 3). Institutionalising it does not inherently imply the EU would be excluded; rather, it raises questions about how the EPC and EU institutions would coordinate (bullet point 6).",

Evolving into a secretariat‑led organisation risks overlapping competencies with EU institutions (European Council, Council of the EU), NATO, and others, creating coordination problems and jurisdictional ambiguity (bullet points 2 and 6)."

The EPC’s lack of a permanent secretariat, core budget and standing staff (index 2) means there is no standing operational apparatus to coordinate rapid, Europe‑wide action, manage logistics, or translate summit-level decisions into immediate, practical measures.

Analytically, the EPC case demonstrates that short, politically mandated monitoring missions can create space and justification for durable institutional presences when on‑the‑ground conditions warrant escalation (index 4).
