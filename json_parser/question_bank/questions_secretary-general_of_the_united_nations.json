The Charter does not create a formal joint electoral college with the binding authority described here; instead, the selection process has been shaped by an interplay of the Security Council and General Assembly (Bullet Points 2–4).

While the Security Council has introduced procedural innovations (e.g., anonymous straw polls during Boutros‑Ghali’s selection), procedural adaptation alone does not by itself resolve the immediate consequence of a veto.

                "0": "Incorrect (this is a realistic risk). The bullet point recommends sustained campaigning, which is resource‑intensive; consuming diplomatic bandwidth is a plausible and realistic downside.",
                "1": "Incorrect (this is a realistic risk). Investing effort in global institutional leadership can attract domestic scrutiny over priorities and costs—consistent with the political trade‑offs implied by the two‑track approach.",
                "2": "Incorrect (this is a realistic risk). P5 members may resist measures that curtail their influence; the bullet point explicitly notes the need to reduce P5 gatekeeping and implies potential pushback that would complicate consensus‑building.",
                "3": "Correct (this is least likely). The bullet point acknowledges P5 gatekeeping and calls for reform plus campaigning as a pragmatic long‑term strategy; it does not suggest that such efforts will instantly remove veto power or produce immediate election outcomes. Instant neutralization of P5 vetoes is unrealistic."
