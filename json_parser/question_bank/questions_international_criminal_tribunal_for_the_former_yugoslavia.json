Which of the following consequences would most directly undermine the ICTY’s ability to deliver credible trials in that period?",

International staffing and rules help legitimacy (bullets 2, 6 and 3), but custody is not merely symbolic—Scheveningen served as an operational node linking transfer, trial and sentence enforcement (bullet 5), so its absence would materially weaken both perceived and actual fairness.",
                "1": "Correct. Bullet points 2, 3 and 5 together show that while procedural rules and prosecutorial capacity are essential, effective custody arrangements are operationally critical. The tribunal had no national prison and depended on state enforcement agreements; Scheveningen was designated as the primary detention centre (bullet 5). Without secure, appropriate detention, accused persons’ rights (treatment, access to counsel) and the ability to present a fair defence would be impaired, damaging legitimacy (bullet 3) even if legal norms and investigative capacity existed (bullets 2 and 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While detention logistics can complicate evidence preservation, the Office of the Prosecutor’s investigative work (bullet 6) is distinct from custodial capacity. The more direct effect of missing detention facilities is on custody, treatment and the accused’s right to counsel (bullet 2), which impacts trial fairness and legitimacy (bullet 3) rather than primarily impeding evidence collection.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The ICTY’s framework emphasized rights of the accused and effective representation (bullets 2 and 3). Trials in absentia would not substitute for custody where access to counsel, confrontation, and detention conditions matter; moreover, the tribunal’s procedures were designed around secure transfer and custody (bullet 5), so normal proceedings could not simply continue without detaining indictees."

The ICTY shows the need to develop legal instruments and custodial arrangements early rather than waiting to see the caseload (bullets 0, 2, 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Deferring rules drafting undermines the legal order necessary for fair trials (bullet 1). Recruiting staff locally contradicts the ICTY’s international staffing model (bullet 6) and may not afford the perception or reality of neutrality. Relying primarily on public relations ignores structural legitimacy secured by procedural safeguards (bullet 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Building facilities first delays operationalization; ICTY used pragmatic interim premises (Aegon building) to accelerate operations (bullet 4). Appointing prosecutors late would slow investigations and indictments, contrary to the ICTY’s rapid OTP operationalisation (bullet 0 and 6). Using domestic prisons without formal enforcement agreements ignores the ICTY’s reliance on state agreements for custody (bullet 5).",

This option synthesises key lessons from the ICTY’s start‑up: the tribunal pursued four interlocking strands—creating a juridical framework, building custodial infrastructure through state enforcement agreements, rapidly staffing the OTP and commencing investigations (bullet 0). Bullet 2 and 3 emphasise early drafting of procedural and defence rules to ensure due process and legitimacy, while bullet 5 and 6 show the operational necessity of detention arrangements and rapid staffing (including the OTP under Goldstone) to make the tribunal functional."

Enforcement agreements and neutral detention (bullet 5) are operationally important and can help legitimacy, but without the procedural framework and guaranteed access to counsel (bullet 2 and 3) such measures would not directly counter accusations of bias as effectively as defence guarantees.",

The explanation notes a limitation: custody and prosecutorial impartiality matter too (bullets 5 and 6).

Chapter VII has been used to establish judicial organs (e.g., the ICTY, as per resolution 827) — the claim that Chapter VII cannot create judicial organs is false (bullet 1 and 2).

This option integrates key features: creation by Security Council resolution under Chapter VII and removal of official capacity as a bar to prosecution (see bullets 3 and 6).

The ICTY’s Statute covered four substantive categories (grave breaches, violations of the laws or customs of war, genocide, crimes against humanity) (bullet 5), but permanent courts may have different statutory scopes. The phrasing 'limited only to the four categories in the Geneva Conventions' is inaccurate because crimes against humanity and some aspects of war crimes extend beyond the Geneva Conventions.",

Limiting transfers to cases where sentences are equated to time served ignores the large number of convicts who actually completed sentences in receiving states (58) and the broader capacity‑building rationale.

This hybrid approach reflects the ICTY practice: permanent judges formed the tribunal’s core for continuity and legitimacy, while ad litem judges—introduced and used increasingly from 2001—expanded capacity to process cases timely (bullet 5).

The ICTY procedures were explicitly designed to embed checks—nominations by states, Security Council screening, and General Assembly election—to reduce dominance by any single organ and secure broad political and normative legitimacy (bullet 4).

Which policy prescription best addresses the combined issues these incidents pose for courtroom management, transparency and public trust if India were designing a domestic or hybrid tribunal?",
              "options": [
                "Avoid prosecuting senior figures to prevent dramatic courtroom events and instead focus solely on lower‑level perpetrators to reduce media attention and political fallout.",
                "Prioritise secrecy and restricted media access to prevent sensationalism and thereby protect proceedings from being undermined by public reactions.",
                "Design robust courtroom management and mental‑health protocols, transparent contempt procedures protecting press freedom, and integrate prosecutions with complementary transitional justice measures (truth commissions, reparations, memorialisation) to bolster public resonance.",
                "Emphasise punitive sentencing to signal strong justice delivery; stronger sentences will offset courtroom incidents and build public trust regardless of procedural design."

              "correct": 2,
              "explanations": {
                "0": "Incorrect. Avoiding prosecution of senior figures reproduces critiques about selective justice and may undermine deterrence and accountability (Bullet Point 14). It also fails to address courtroom management or transparency concerns and could worsen perceptions of impunity (Bullet Point 17).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Restricting media access may reduce sensationalism short term but risks accusations of secrecy, undermining transparency and public trust; contempt and press freedom issues (Hartmann case) require clear rules rather than blanket secrecy (Bullet Points 14 and 15).",
                "2": "Correct. The incidents listed show courtroom management, press‑freedom and sentencing controversies affect legitimacy and public resonance (Bullet Point 14). Bullet Point 16 advises treating transitional justice as complementary to prosecutions. Robust procedures, transparent contempt rules and integration with reconciliation measures address legal fairness and public perceptions simultaneously (Bullet Points 16 and 17).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Heavier sentencing does not resolve courtroom management failures, press‑freedom concerns, or the need for reconciliation; moreover, controversial sentences have themselves provoked backlash at the ICTY (Vukovar/Ovčara, Dubrovnik cases—Bullet Point 14)."
