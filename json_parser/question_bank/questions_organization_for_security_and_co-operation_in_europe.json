The effective crisis‑management model in Kosovo required coordinated roles: NATO/KFOR for security and stabilization, UNMIK for political administration under UN auspices, and the OSCE for verification and institution‑building. This complementarity is explicitly noted as a lesson for mission design and orchestration (Index 10d) and summarised in the cluster’s lessons about mandate, security backing and actor roles (Index 11).

The claim that they are more effective than the UN for coercive action is contradicted by the Kosovo case: when protecting sovereignty norms and undertaking coercive tasks is required, states typically prefer UN legitimacy and clear security arrangements rather than consensus technical bodies lacking enforcement capacity (Indexes 10b, 10c, 11).",

Because the OSCE operating model in Serbia is state‑invited and therefore sensitive to official political will (bullet 6), strengthening domestic anchors — independent institutions plus an active civil society — helps embed reforms beyond the ebb and flow of ministerial politics and makes reforms more resilient."

At the same time, the OSCE's operating style—ministerials producing Decisions and Declarations and relying on participating States—relies heavily on consensus (bullet 33).
