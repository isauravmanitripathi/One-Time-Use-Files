                "1": "Incorrect. Unilateral border fortification contradicts the cooperative and integrative spirit of SICA (bullet point 2) and risks undermining sub‑regional arrangements like the CA‑4 that facilitate legal mobility (bullet point 6); it addresses symptoms but not root causes such as climate impacts and economic exclusion.",
                "2": "Correct. A coordinated migration‑management plus sustainable development corridor approach directly addresses interlinked problems described in bullet point 0 (migration flows, environmental vulnerabilities, trade corridors like the Inter‑American Highway) and aligns with SICA’s cross‑sectoral remit for political, economic, social and environmental integration (bullet point 2). Such an approach leverages cooperation rather than imposing supranational measures that would conflict with national sovereignty.",

While Costa Rica serving as the administrative hub produced operational centralization, the term was relatively long (ten years), not short, and the institutional design prioritized protecting sovereignty (one-judge-per-state) rather than explicitly subordinating independence to efficiency.

This enlargement enlarges market size and brings in economies with different structures and trade patterns, which increases the technical and political pressure on the CACM (the economic integration vehicle) to harmonize tariffs and trade rules across a more diverse membership (bullet points 4 and 6). This is the most significant institutional implication because CACM’s role is central to market integration and tariff coordination (bullet point 4).",

While enlargement may affect identity and cohesion, the statement understates the immediate functional implications for economic instruments: enlargement has concrete technical consequences for CACM’s operation (bullet points 4 and 6), not merely symbolic effects on political cohesion."

The bullet highlights that the CCJ shows both promise (clarifying obligations, managing disputes, promoting harmonization) and limits (constrained authority due to jurisdictional design and member states’ political choices).
