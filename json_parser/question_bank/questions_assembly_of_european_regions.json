The term “wider Europe” indicates participation beyond EU membership (bullet 3), so a non‑EU Caucasus region can use AER to coordinate with EU and non‑EU peers and amplify its voice in broader European forums.",

Working through broader interregional networks leverages scale, legitimacy and sustained advocacy more effectively than isolated bilateral arrangements.",

Such soft, long-term capacity-building creates networks and socialisation across borders rather than relying solely on administrative or symbolic measures."

The CRE’s founding (1985) and its institutionalisation as AER by 1987 created a durable channel for sub‑national actors to pursue collective interests across borders (bullet point 1).
