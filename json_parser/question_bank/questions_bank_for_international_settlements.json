The institutional logic described in the cluster emphasizes neutral siting and central bank ownership to foster trust and political neutrality among states and central banks (bullet 0). Early proposals (Wolff, Lévy, Luzzatti) explicitly recommended neutral locations and standing institutions rather than ad hoc bargains (bullet 4). This design insulated the forum from parochial national interests and promoted multilateral cooperation.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Subordinating the institution to fiscal policy would have undermined its neutrality. The historical emphasis was on central bank ownership (not treasury control) precisely because central banks were the actors responsible for liquidity and credit coordination (bullets 0 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While wartime innovations such as telegraphic links and foreign offices did reduce transaction costs and aided coordination (bullet 5), these are operational complements rather than the primary reason for neutral siting and shared ownership. The central rationale for neutral siting was political neutrality and legitimacy, not just cost saving.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The BIS model mixed private and public actors, but it did not cede emergency liquidity policy to private banks. Central banks maintained operational control; private actors were included to tap expertise and networks, not to set policy (bullet 0)."

Automatic open membership with one uniform rulebook risks lowering standards or imposing rules misaligned with national legal frameworks and sovereignty concerns (Bullet points 1 and 3).

                "2": "Correct. Suspension of a member injects geopolitical considerations into a forum that is formally technical, reducing the diversity of views and the representativeness of discussions. That change alters who has access and influence and sends a political signal about the BIS’s institutional stance, which can undermine the perceived legitimacy of collective pronouncements among middle powers and rising economies that feel excluded or disagree with the political signal (see bullet 7 and bullet 11). The closed elite nature of BIS deliberation also means these changes in composition materially affect which networks and perspectives shape outcomes (bullet 13).",

Technical debates benefit from diverse perspectives and comparative experience; narrowing participation can reduce the range of practical knowledge feeding into standards and can introduce bias, damaging both substance and perceived legitimacy (contrasts with bullet 7 and bullet 13)."

A chair from the private sector is likely to bring private‑sector perspectives into BIS discussions, altering emphasis in committees and working groups.
