Conditional, performance-based loans may protect macroeconomic concerns of larger members (bullet 5) but are poorly suited to address immediate adaptation needs of SIDS, who often require grant-based support due to limited fiscal space. Such an approach risks sidelining vulnerability and inclusion priorities central to ECLAC negotiations (bullet 5).",

Equal per-country allocation treats unequal needs as equal, which can be deeply unfair given the wide variation in vulnerability and capacity among ECLAC members (bullet 5). It would likely be opposed by both highly vulnerable states seeking greater support and donors/large economies expecting differentiated treatment (bullet 4).",

A vulnerability-weighted approach acknowledges the coexistence of diverse development profiles within ECLAC — SIDS and large economies (bullet 5) — and reflects the commission’s role as a platform for technical cooperation and blended financing (bullet 4). Including co-financing or matched funding brings extra‑regional donors and large members into the solution while addressing vulnerability-driven needs, improving acceptability across the membership."

If creditors do not accept meaningful nominal relief, the mechanism will not create fiscal space and therefore cannot finance the public green investments and redistribution ECLAC envisions (bullets 3–5).",
                "1": "Why D is incorrect: This is an overgeneralisation. ECLAC emphasises financing in fiscally sustainable ways (bullet 2 and 3). Whether redistributive measures are inflationary depends on macro conditions, financing modalities, and the composition of spending. The swap’s success depends more directly on creditor relief, governance and the quality of investments (bullets 3–5).",
                "2": "Why A is incorrect: While moral hazard is a theoretical concern, ECLAC’s design places emphasis on creditor agreement and governance conditions (bullets 4 and 5). The swap is not presented as an automatic or recurring creditor concession; it is conditional, negotiated and tied to monitoring. The design aims to avoid perverse incentives rather than assume automatic debt relief.",

ECLAC argues for integrating environmental and climate objectives into fiscal and investment policy (bullet 1) rather than concentrating responsibility solely within environmental ministries; therefore the swap is designed to feed public investment programmes across sectors, not overload environment ministries alone (bullets 2 and 5b)."

This option reflects the cluster’s adaptation of ECLAC’s debt‑swap idea to India (Bullet 10): where direct external debt swaps may be less applicable, India can use ring‑fenced green/resilience bonds, blended public‑private vehicles channelled through development banks, and sovereign climate guarantees to create protected fiscal flows and mobilise private capital for strategic resilience projects. It also aligns with the need for partnerships and strong governance (Bullet 11) and the broader conceptual linkage between fiscal policy, equity and green transformation (Bullet 12).",

While direct debt‑for‑nature swaps are central to ECLAC’s model, the cluster notes these are less immediately applicable to India given its creditor/debtor profile (Bullet 10). External commercial debt swaps are less feasible for India and do not incorporate the domestic financial engineering (green bonds, guarantees, blended finance) recommended for mobilising private capital and protecting fiscal flows.",
