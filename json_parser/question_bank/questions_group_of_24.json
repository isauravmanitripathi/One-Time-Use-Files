This nuanced evaluation aligns with the documented arrangement: the IMF provides secretariat services (logistics, meeting facilities, technical briefings) that facilitate the G‑24’s work, but that support is administrative and does not make the G‑24 an organ of the Fund or give the IMF control over policy positions (bullet 5).
