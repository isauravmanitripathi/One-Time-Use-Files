Bullet point 3 notes Saudi's influence on priorities, but bullet point 3 together with bullet point 4 makes clear that Shariah compliance is a core institutional characteristic enforced by Shariah supervisory boards. Even influential shareholders do not automatically bypass Shariah oversight, which is central to product eligibility.",

While Saudi may influence priority-setting (bullet point 3), there is no indication that IsDB would cede governance to other regional banks; decision-making remains within IsDB's sovereign bodies (bullet point 1 and 2). Delegation to bilateral partners is not the typical consequence of a major shareholder's influence.",

Bullet points 1 and 2 establish that IsDB is governed by sovereign representation and strategic direction is determined through member-state bodies; bullet point 3 explains Saudi Arabia's disproportionate influence via capital commitments and leadership roles. Therefore, Saudi can shape geographic emphasis and the mix of concessional versus commercial operations through its leverage, affecting program design and priorities."
