Using hosting primarily for a next‑quarter GDP spike misreads the strategic calculus.",

While bilateral deals sometimes occur around summits, the dataset and strategic notes emphasise agenda‑setting and visibility rather than guaranteed bargaining leverage. Trade concessions depend on underlying economic clout and leverage, not merely hosting (Indices 3 and 5). Treating hosting as a primary instrument to extract long‑term concessions overstates its direct negotiating power.",

Operational and security capabilities are necessary (Index 6) to host safely, but the purpose of demonstrating such capacity is supportive—it underpins hosting credibility.

Hosting provides a global stage to project competent governance, set agenda priorities and shape narratives—classic soft‑power benefits highlighted in the dataset’s strategic implication (Index 5). Repeated use of hosting to signal capability (Index 3) and the explicit note that summit diplomacy is used for agenda‑setting (Index 5) make this the most direct and enduring strategic payoff compared with transient or peripheral gains."

Concentrating in a single mega‑city can provide infrastructure advantages, but for a middle‑income host that lacks such capacity it risks prohibitive permanent costs and operational overload (Index 6).

It allows APEC members to sustain essential economic coordination (e.g., trade facilitation, customs cooperation, energy and food security) while reducing political frictions.

Electronic single‑window and simplified documentation speed clearance and lower compliance burdens next. Harmonized standards and MRAs reduce duplicative testing, and large transport projects are important but costlier and slower to implement, so placing them later maximizes near‑term gains with limited funds."

Delaying public engagement and agenda clarity risks backlash, security issues, and lost opportunities for coherent multilateral outcomes.",

While ceremony and publicity can project soft power, the bullet point warns that ceremony alone is insufficient; without stability, security and clear agenda, a summit can undermine objectives. Overemphasis on spectacle risks neglecting practical planning and stakeholder buy-in.",

The bullet point emphasises that hosts must plan beyond ceremony because domestic political stability, security planning, civil society engagement and agenda clarity jointly determine whether a summit enhances or undermines national strategic objectives.

This option mirrors the bullet point’s main assessment: APEC shows the promise of norm-setting and capacity building but also the limits of consensus, non-binding fora in delivering collective action on sharp geopolitical disputes. The recommended institutional response — relying on formal rule‑making institutions for enforceable commitments — is explicitly stated in the bullet.",

The constraining force here stems from legal mechanisms and diffusion of standards, not solely from who is excluded (see index 4 and index 3).",

                "2": "Correct. The combination of TRIPS‑plus intellectual property approaches and ISDS clauses in trade and investment agreements can increase legal and political risks for governments that regulate in the public interest. Even if APEC itself is non‑binding, the diffusion of liberalising standards (policy harmonisation risk) and the availability of ISDS in related agreements can produce strong incentives to avoid measures that might trigger costly arbitration — a point reflected in criticisms about specific legal mechanisms and the broader tension between trade agendas and regulatory sovereignty (see bullet points index 2, index 3 and index 5).",
