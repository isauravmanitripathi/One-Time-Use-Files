Tactical guest invitations (Index 6) let India shape deliberations on regionally relevant issues, and participation in complementary, issue-focused formats such as D-10 (Index 1) and GPAI (Index 2) yields policy influence on technology and democratic coalitions without destabilizing the G7’s institutional informality.",

The United States has the largest absolute trade volume (USD 6,786 billion) but its nominal GDP (USD 26,854.6 billion) is much larger, giving a low trade/GDP ratio (~25%).
