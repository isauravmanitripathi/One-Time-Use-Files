                "0": "Incorrect. While AIIB’s Beijing headquarters and China’s initiative give it geopolitical significance (bullet 0 and 1), accession by non‑regional states was driven more by the desire to engage with and influence a rapidly growing MDB rather than to obtain unilateral control over project selection. Governance of multilateral banks involves multiple members, not exclusive control by the founder.",
                "1": "Correct. Rapid accession by diverse non‑regional members signaled broad acceptance and interest in shaping the new bank’s governance and project pipeline, and membership offers opportunities to access infrastructure finance at scale (bullets 1 and 6). This option captures both the governance engagement motive and the practical financing benefits consistent with the cluster.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The AIIB focuses on infrastructure sectors and mobilizing long‑term finance (bullet 2), but accession does not guarantee immediate or substantial concessional financing irrespective of sector and creditworthiness. Lending depends on bank policies, project eligibility, and financing terms—so this claim overstates likely outcomes.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While members may coordinate, accession to AIIB is not primarily a mechanism to redirect all bilateral financing or consolidate resources away from other MDBs. The cluster emphasizes AIIB’s complementarity, scale and open membership (bullets 1 and 6) rather than serving as a tool to replace other MDBs or bilateral lenders."

Simply raising paid‑in capital equally is not practical because paid‑in capital is tied to share subscription and members' ability to pay; moreover, equal increases in paid‑in by all members do not change the relative distribution of share votes (which reflect shares subscribed).

Because the AIIB’s voting is numerically dominated by share votes (≈85%) and China holds ≈26.1% (so no unilateral control), major decisions typically require coalition building among large shareholders. India should therefore combine its vote weight with diplomatic coalition‑building among medium and large members and, where useful, rely on basic/founding‑member protections as bargaining leverage.

Although the World Bank and ADB have strong safeguard frameworks, insisting they lead exclusively ignores the non-zero-sum logic highlighted by Jim Yong Kim and others: additional multilateral capacity (like AIIB) can complement Bretton Woods institutions and expand options for recipient countries (bullets 1 and 5).

This synthesis aligns with the cluster: AIIB’s paid‑in capital as a percent of subscribed capital (about 20.0%) is markedly higher than older MDBs (bullet 0 and 5), indicating an emphasis on cash contributions early on. At the same time, AIIB’s lending‑to‑assets ratio is lower (22.3%) compared with ADB and IBRD (bullet 2 and 6), consistent with an institution in early portfolio build‑up and pipeline development rather than aggressive lending. Operational maturity and mandate also support this interpretation (bullet 3 and 6).",

The dual approach recognises the empirical pattern in 2016 where AIIB co‑financed six of nine projects with major MDBs (bringing safeguards, technical standards and reputation) while also originating three standalone operations where it assumed leadership (bullets 1, 5, 6, 7).

Bullet 0 notes AIIB pivoted into emergency health, budget support, credit lines and equity/fund investments while still maintaining some resilience and low‑carbon lending.
