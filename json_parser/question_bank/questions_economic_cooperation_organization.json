                "1": "Incorrect. The accession did not instantly impose full tariff harmonisation; instead frameworks like ECOTA were later agreed (bullet 4) and implementation was phased and uneven (bullet 4 and 6). There is no record that accession itself caused trade collapse.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The Secretariat is located in Tehran (bullet 2), but while location can affect perceptions, it is not described as an irreconcilable barrier. The primary constraints were uneven implementation, domestic capacities and political economy issues (bullet 6).",

Creating a binding framework that harmonises customs and rules of origin would address the core technical and legal barriers to an integrated market (bullet 2 on legal/organisational character points to need to move beyond purely intergovernmental coordination for such outcomes).",

Excluding smaller states via ad hoc bilateral arrangements weakens the ECO’s multilateral fabric and the principle of mutual advantage and sovereign equality (Bullet 13).

This option combines measures that promote value‑addition and regional value chains (tariff harmonization for intermediates, industrial parks, joint ventures) consistent with the ECO’s objective to mobilize and utilize material resources and move beyond raw exports (Bullet 7, Bullet 8). Mobilizing concessional multilateral finance aligns with the ECO’s principle of cooperating with regional and international organizations for technical assistance and legitimacy (Bullet 12). Keeping measures voluntary and incentive‑based respects sovereign equality and mutual advantage (Bullet 13) and is also compatible with India’s interest in partnering on technology and investment while avoiding supranational imposition.",

A donor‑controlled agency may accelerate funding but would bypass member ownership and the ECO secretariat’s coordination, risking sustainability and political buy‑in. Leaving interoperability to later stages contradicts the recommendation to invest in interoperable digital systems from the outset (bullets 10 and 12) and undermines scalable track‑and‑trace solutions.",

Bilateral MOUs tailored to each country risk fragmentation and lack of interoperability (contrary to the digitalisation recommendation) and can create duplicative systems and higher transaction costs. Reliance on ad‑hoc donor grants undermines sustainable financing and continuity (bullets 12 and 11). This approach also fails to clarify ECO‑level mandates and coordination (bullet 10).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Purely commercial, short‑term private operation may improve efficiency but risks excluding less profitable routes (hurting last‑mile connectivity and inclusion), and minimal state contribution undermines blended financing and shared ownership. It also sidesteps the need for coordinated mandates and interoperable systems across national postal operators (bullets 7, 10, 11, 13).",

This option integrates governance clarity (defining mandates and reporting lines) to prevent overlap and mission creep, invests in interoperable digital systems to reduce transaction costs and enable track‑and‑trace (cross‑cutting digitalisation), adopts a blended financing approach for continuity (member contributions + donor co‑financing + revenue‑generating services), and mainstreams inclusion and gender sensitivity — all recommended across the cluster (bullets 10, 12, 11, 13).
