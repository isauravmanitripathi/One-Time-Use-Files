Member states can use basin planning, data‑sharing protocols and prior consultation procedures in the Mekong Agreement (bullet 3) to coordinate mitigation measures among downstream countries (bullets 0 and 1). Because China/Myanmar are not full members (bullet 4), engagement with them must proceed via consultative and dialogue mechanisms rather than through enforcement under the Agreement.",

The 1995 Mekong Agreement (bullet 2) provides procedures for cooperation among its signatories, but upstream states that control the upper reaches (China, Myanmar) are not signatories and do not fall under its binding procedural obligations (bullet 3 and 4). Therefore the Agreement cannot be used to compel a non‑member to share data or change operations.",

While engineering measures may mitigate some impacts, unilateral downstream fixes ignore the interdependence of basin hydrology and may be costly, ineffective or politically contentious.
