                "1": "Correct — The Secretariat services meetings, coordinates information exchange and supports implementation of environmental and scientific protocols (bullet 1). India can best leverage the Secretariat’s convening power by coalition‑building at ATCMs, presenting coordinated scientific data and using the Secretariat’s platforms for transparency and agenda servicing to influence operational norms (bullet 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect — Secret bilateral agreements bypass the multilateral transparency and compliance mechanisms that the Secretariat helps maintain. Such an approach undermines norms and could erode India’s credibility in environmental governance at the ATCM (bullets 1 and 4).",

The Executive Secretary’s role is administrative, and substantive policy influence comes through Parties and ATCM processes rather than through personnel appointments alone (bullet 3)."
