                "1": "Correct. This option synthesises key SAT principles: use of drought‑tolerant, short‑duration crops and dryland legumes (bullet 4 and 5) reduces exposure to erratic monsoons (bullet 0). Intercropping with legumes and use of manures/targeted fertilisers addresses nutrient‑poor soils (bullet 1 and 3). Mulching and contour bunding conserve soil and moisture (bullet 5). Together these measures manage risk where irrigation is unreliable (bullet 1).",

While irrigation can reduce drought risk, large‑scale groundwater extraction is often infeasible or unsustainable in SAT due to limited resources, cost and socio‑technical constraints (bullet 1). Moreover, dependence on unreliable or costly irrigation neglects agroecological soil and crop management that build resilience (bullets 3, 5).",

This integrated strategy follows the cluster’s recommended starting points (bullet point 3 / Index 16) and the concluding rationale (bullet point 2 / Index 15): use ICRISAT program pages and annual reports for outputs and partnerships, ORCID/Google Scholar for verifying individual contributions (bullet point 1 / Index 14), and CGIAR/ICAR portals to validate registered varieties and formal partnerships—producing a credible, policy‑relevant account."
