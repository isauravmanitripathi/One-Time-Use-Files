While ICIC’s use of eminent intellectuals (bullet point 2) provided moral authority and networks, relying primarily on a small elite commission repeats the interwar model’s weakness: limited resilience to geopolitical shocks and biased representation (bullet points 3 and 4). It does not address the structural fragility revealed by World War II (bullet point 6).",

NGO technical expertise (as exemplified by the IBE — bullet point 6) is valuable for programmatic work in education, but an NGO‑only structure risks the same vulnerability to political disruption and limited authority that the interwar NGOs and commissions experienced (bullet points 0 and 6).

Julian Huxley’s intellectual stature and internationalist orientation shaped UNESCO’s early emphasis on universalist, expert‑led programmes in education, science and culture, with engagement from cross‑sector actors (Index 7).

The ISC (formerly ICSU and ISSC) focuses on global science collaboration and evidence production (bullet 6), which would bring strong scientific resources.

WFEO (and IUTAO networks) bring engineering and technical standards expertise (bullet 6), which could support infrastructure aspects of island sustainability, and IAU brings higher‑education coordination.

However, ASC membership itself spans a range of domains—from local networks (WFUCA) through culture, media and technical professions to island development (INSULA)—so the diversity of ASC organisations provides some mitigating breadth (bullets 3, 4, 5).

This option aligns with the cluster’s depiction of a multi‑layered field architecture: Cluster Offices enable resource optimisation (bullet point 4 and 2) but are balanced by National and Specialized Offices where local legitimacy or symbolic presence matters (bullet point 6).

National Offices do provide depth and proximity for direct policy support and programme delivery (bullet 4), which is crucial for mobilising heritage domestically (bullet 0).

Pre‑signed MoUs and rapid‑response protocols with technical partners such as BSI and ICOM, together with designated national points of contact, are specifically recommended to ensure swift mobilisation of expertise for threatened sites or collections (Index 8, 10).

                "2": "Incorrect. Relying entirely on international contributors neglects the need for local administrative responsibility and accountability. The cluster stresses domestic governance (explicit admin/patching responsibilities) even in open-source transitions (bullets 10 and 11).",
                "3": "Correct. The cluster emphasises verifying licensing after an open-source transition and the importance of explicit system-administration and patching responsibilities (bullet 10). It also warns that many installations were designed for older OS, creating compatibility and security concerns; thus ensuring supported OS versions or sandboxing is essential (bullet 10). Active domestic participation (contributing code/localisation) is encouraged but must be paired with operational governance (bullet 11) to ensure resilience (bullet 12)."
