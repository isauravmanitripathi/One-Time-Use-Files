The interwar experience showed that bodies centred on commissions and NGOs (ICIC and IIIC/IBE) produced valuable intellectual and technical work but proved fragile when confronted with geopolitics and war. Bullet points 0 and 5 describe the continuity from League initiatives to UNESCO’s eventual creation within the UN; bullet point 5 (IIIC’s role) and bullet point 6 (World War II interruption) underline the need for a more durable, state‑based institutional framework with political commitments and predictable resources.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While ICIC’s use of eminent intellectuals (bullet point 2) provided moral authority and networks, relying primarily on a small elite commission repeats the interwar model’s weakness: limited resilience to geopolitical shocks and biased representation (bullet points 3 and 4). It does not address the structural fragility revealed by World War II (bullet point 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. A well‑staffed secretariat (similar to the IIIC in Paris — bullet point 4) is important, but locating administrative capacity in one place without formal state commitments or intergovernmental backing fails to fix the core problem of durability and political legitimacy exposed by WWII (bullet point 6).",

NGO technical expertise (as exemplified by the IBE — bullet point 6) is valuable for programmatic work in education, but an NGO‑only structure risks the same vulnerability to political disruption and limited authority that the interwar NGOs and commissions experienced (bullet points 0 and 6). It would struggle to secure the sustained state commitment needed for global reach."

The Atlantic Charter (1941) and related wartime diplomacy provided the early moral and political foundation that extended Allied commitments to social, economic and cultural reconstruction and framed education, science and culture as safeguards against future conflict (bullet 0). The Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) acted as a practical wartime forum for planning educational reconstruction and international cultural cooperation (bullet 1). The United Nations Conference on International Organization (UNCIO) in San Francisco codified the UN Charter, which created the umbrella institutional architecture enabling recognition of specialised agencies like UNESCO (bullet 4). Together these three map to the roles asked in the question."
