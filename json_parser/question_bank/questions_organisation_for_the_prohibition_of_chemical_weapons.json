While high‑level diplomacy in The Hague is necessary (the OPCW’s policymaking happens there and The Hague carries legal and symbolic weight), delegating technical cooperation to ad hoc remote arrangements ignores the importance of proximate technical infrastructure (e.g., Rijswijk labs and equipment stores) that enable timely, rigorous verification and rapid deployment (see bullets 1, 3 and 4). Effective engagement requires both diplomacy and technical ties, not diplomacy alone.",
                "1": "Partially correct but incomplete. Bilateral technical partnerships with the OPCW’s Rijswijk facilities address the need for access to analytic and logistical capabilities (bullet 3 and 4), but a minimal diplomatic presence undervalues the policy, legal and institutional interactions centred in The Hague (bullet 1 and 2). The OPCW’s institutional life combines policy and technical dimensions; India needs both.",
                "2": "Correct. This option recognises the dual reality shown by the OPCW: location in The Hague matters for policy, law and diplomacy (bullets 1 and 2), while proximate technical infrastructure such as the headquarters’ neighbouring facilities and the Rijswijk laboratory enable timely, rigorous verification and operational participation (bullets 3 and 4). For India, planning should therefore combine diplomatic engagement, formal ties to technical/logistical apparatuses, and practical preparations for inspections and training (bullet 5).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Building domestic capacity is valuable, but avoiding direct operational involvement with OPCW facilities ignores how treaty implementation often requires interaction with an IO’s established infrastructure and complementary institutions (bullets 3, 4 and 5). Sovereignty concerns cannot substitute for the benefits of proximity to the OPCW’s verification and policymaking apparatus."

The Convention requires regulation, declarations and destruction of prohibited holdings, not prohibition of all toxic chemicals used for legitimate purposes (bullet 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. A purely voluntary reporting regime would not meet the CWC’s positive obligations for mandatory declarations and verification. Verification is the OPCW’s operational core and relies on mandatory declarations and routine inspections to assess compliance (bullets 4 and 5).",

The CWC imposes both negative obligations (to refrain from prohibited acts) and positive obligations (to declare holdings, destroy stockpiles, and establish domestic controls) and requires verification (bullets 2 and 4). Because the Convention addresses the full life cycle of chemicals and dual‑use technologies, effective national policy must cover civilian and military sectors and include mandatory declarations and acceptance of routine inspections (bullets 3, 4 and 5). This package therefore aligns with the CWC/OPCW framework.",

The ILO ruling underscores the need for formal, enforceable procedures rather than informal practices (bullet 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Very short terms with easy reappointment increase political leverage over the officeholder and incentivise accommodation to member states’ pressures. The ILO finding suggests the remedy is stronger, not weaker, procedural safeguards (bullet 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Granting a formal veto to powerful states would institutionalise disproportionate influence and could entrench the very state‑sponsored interference the reform seeks to prevent (as critics alleged in the Bustani case where U.S. pressure was cited; bullet 5). Protecting independence requires insulating leadership from single‑state dominance, not empowering it.",
                "3": "Correct. The Bustani episode and the ILO Administrative Tribunal ruling (bullets 5 and 6) show the risks when removals are politically driven and procedures are opaque. Codifying a high threshold for removal and requiring independent review would protect the executive from undue political pressure while still allowing states to remove leadership for legitimate causes. This directly addresses vulnerabilities noted in the OPCW case study about leadership independence and procedural propriety (bullet 0 and 6)."

The CWC framework and OPCW practice indicate that an FFM is structured to determine whether chemical agents were used and is less intrusive, but it does not undertake formal attribution.
