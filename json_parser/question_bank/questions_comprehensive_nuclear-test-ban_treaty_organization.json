Moreover, radionuclide positives need careful analysis of plume, background and source. Hence radionuclide data do not obviate seismic analysis and contextual assessment (bullets 6 and 7).",

The IMS is designed as a complementary network (seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound, radionuclide) because combining different sensing modalities improves detection sensitivity and discrimination between natural/industrial and nuclear events (bullet 5 and 6). Seismic data provide location and waveform clues; radionuclide detection can provide direct evidence of a nuclear detonation if gases/particulates are present; and IDC automated processing plus skilled analysts apply contextual and comparative methods to assess signals (bullet 7).",

These activities build evidence, reinforce norms, create political costs for testing (Index 12) and broaden stakeholder engagement.

Ocean acoustic propagation modelling refines source range/bearing estimates (Bullet point 2). The GCI is used to retrieve delayed station data when real‑time links are intermittent (Bullet point 6), and radionuclide sampling can be tasked although underwater detonations often yield limited particulate releases—noble gas monitoring may still be relevant but particulate signatures may be unlikely (Bullet point 4).

Authorization for an OSI is an internal CTBT process handled by the Executive Council following a State Party request. Thus a Security Council referral does not substitute for the required State Party request plus Executive Council approval (see bullet 3).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While OSIs are only available after the Treaty enters into force, the restriction in the options statement is too absolute. The key procedural barrier is who may request an OSI (only State Parties), not that inspections are categorically limited to territory of parties; furthermore, until entry into force OSIs cannot be conducted at all under the Treaty — but this option conflates two separate issues. The correct legal constraints are that OSIs are treaty mechanisms available after entry into force and that only State Parties can request them (bullets 0 and 3).",

A State Party (including a neighbouring one) can request an inspection even if the event is on foreign soil, but the Executive Council—a 51‑member body—must approve the inspection. Approval requires a deliberately high political threshold (at least 30 affirmative votes). This reflects the political gatekeeping described in the cluster (see bullets 0 and 3) and the role of the Executive Council in authorizing OSIs (bullet 3).",

This sequence follows the CTBT’s phased inspection methodology: the initial period (up to 25 days) emphasizes non‑intrusive/passive techniques such as aerial and ground reconnaissance, passive seismic monitoring, gamma surveys, and radionuclide (notably noble gas) sampling. If those methods indicate the need for more invasive investigation, the Executive Council can authorize a continuation (up to 60 days) during which active seismic experiments, ground‑penetrating radar, gravity/electric/magnetic surveys and limited drilling may be used. This balances sovereignty concerns with the need for conclusive evidence (see bullets 4, 5 and 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Performing intrusive measures simultaneously with passive methods on day one violates the escalation principle and the operational sequencing embedded in OSI procedures.

This approach aligns with practical and legal constraints: use IMS and other data to narrow search areas, apply passive, non‑intrusive techniques early (within the 25‑day initial period) to capture time‑sensitive signals such as short‑lived noble gas isotopes (xenon) and to refine location via passive seismic methods, and then seek a continuation to use active and intrusive techniques only if needed. It respects limits on team size and duration and leverages the prescribed sequencing that balances sovereignty and evidentiary needs (bullets 4, 5 and 6).",

The CTBT prescribes a 40‑inspector cap and restricts intrusive drilling to an authorized continuation period; logistics and sovereignty concerns also make unlimited drilling unrealistic (bullets 3, 4 and 6).",

While publication of IMS data can create diplomatic pressure, the CTBT framework provides for State Party requests and Executive Council approval to seek conclusive on‑the‑ground evidence; preparedness and careful sequencing (using IMS to focus effort and early passive sampling) is the more effective operational route (bullets 0, 3, 4 and 5).",

Visual and aerial reconnaissance are useful but insufficient by themselves; radionuclide (especially noble gas) sampling during the initial period is critical because some signals decay or dissipate rapidly.

The passage explains that advance declarations reduce ambiguity, ease the workload on C&C and OSI procedures, and diminish political risk that an unexplained event will trigger crisis escalation.
