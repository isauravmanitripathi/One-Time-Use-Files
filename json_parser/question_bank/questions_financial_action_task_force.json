Mutual Evaluations are FATF’s principal tool for assessing implementation in law and practice and often drive domestic reform by requiring changes in legislation, supervisory frameworks and prosecutorial practice (bullet 6 and 7). When combined with public identification of deficiencies and targeted guidance (bullet 5 and 6), they create reputational and economic pressure that encourages rapid domestic action, especially on emerging risks like virtual assets and terrorist financing (bullet 4 and 5).",

Immediate mandatory countermeasures and comprehensive international sanctions are characteristics associated with the highest level of concern (the blacklist) in extreme cases and with actions taken by other actors, not an automatic consequence of greylisting. Greylisting is labelled 'Other monitored jurisdictions' and is about increased monitoring and engagement rather than automatic sanctions (see bullets 6 and 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Greylisting does not automatically suspend membership rights nor does it physically exclude a country from financial markets. Rather it triggers monitoring, reputational effects and potential voluntary countermeasures by other actors; full suspension or market exclusion is not an automatic FATF procedure (bullets 6 and 4).",

FATF’s greylist identifies jurisdictions under increased monitoring to concentrate political pressure and practical countermeasures; FATF uses public reports, peer pressure and reputational leverage to encourage reform rather than issuing binding international law. This matches the listing regime's purpose and FATF’s role as a policy‑making body that shapes norms (bullets 6, 4 and 0).

                "0": "Incorrect. The chapter makes clear that naming does have real impact — it reshapes AML/CFT landscapes — so denying any impact is inconsistent with the analysis.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The claim is not supported by the chapter; it does not suggest a simple size‑based immunity. Rather, it emphasises that all states must translate international standards proportionately to avoid negative consequences.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While naming is powerful, the chapter does not claim reputational measures alone guarantee proportional or effective outcomes; it warns against equating regulatory proliferation driven by naming with actual security gains.",
                "3": "Correct. This option aligns with the chapter’s nuance: FATF’s naming power produces hard effects and incentives to comply, but without careful, evidence‑based domestic implementation these effects can lead to disproportionate regulation and unintended harms to humanitarian access, civil society, and inclusion."

                "0": "Incorrect. Volume of flows and staffing or instrument counts show scale but not proportionality or real improvements in security, nor do they measure humanitarian or inclusion impacts the chapter emphasises.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Public naming and fines measure pressure and enforcement intensity, but they do not indicate whether outcomes are proportionate or whether humanitarian actors and the financially excluded are adversely affected — a key concern in the chapter.",
                "2": "Correct. This set balances traditional security metrics (convictions) with measures that reflect proportionate, evidence‑based implementation (risk‑based exemptions) and monitors collateral effects on NGOs and vulnerable populations (banking access, remittance penetration). It directly addresses the chapter’s call to secure financial integrity without sacrificing humanitarian access, civil society vitality, or inclusion.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While legislative activity and STR counts reflect regulatory output and reporting, they are poor proxies for actual security outcomes and ignore humanitarian access and financial inclusion concerns highlighted in the chapter."
