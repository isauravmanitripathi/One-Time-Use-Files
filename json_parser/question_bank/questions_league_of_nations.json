The pivotal issue was binding commitments to collective action (Bullets 5, 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While financial burdens can be politically sensitive, the decisive League example was not fiscal objections but the constitutional question over who can commit the state to war. The Treaty of Versailles debate centred on Article X and legislative control rather than treaty dues (Bullets 5, 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Multilingual practices (French/German identities) were part of the League’s symbolic inclusiveness (Bullet 0), but they were not a principal reason for the U.S. Senate’s refusal to ratify. Constitutional and sovereignty concerns over collective security were paramount (Bullets 5, 6).",
                "3": "Correct. The League case shows that Article X‑type commitments that appear to bind states to collective action without requiring domestic legislative approval provoked constitutional objections. In the United States, Senate Republicans led by Lodge argued that only Congress could commit the nation to war; Wilson rejected reservations and ratification failed (Bullet 5). This demonstrates how domestic constitutional control over declarations of war can block international commitments that seem to bypass legislative authority (Bullets 1, 5, 6)."

This nuanced critique aligns with the cluster: the League did not arise from a single cause but from legal codification, philosophical legitimacy, precedent, and civil society (bullet 8). Figures like Roosevelt embodied a pragmatic mix of arbitration and acceptance of great‑power roles (bullet 7). Thus, while great‑power prerogatives constrained the League, it still embodied normative achievements and institutional forms rather than being categorically doomed from inception (bullets 8 and 10)."

The 14 December 1939 expulsion of the Soviet Union for invading Finland was largely symbolic: it reflected a still‑available punitive mechanism but was politically selective and too late to restore credibility. By then the League had suffered expulsions and mass withdrawals and effectively ceased to function as an effective international organisation with genuine enforcement capability (bullet 8).",
                "1": "Incorrect. This reverses the relationship: the League’s legal authority existed in form but lacked political and enforcement backing. Legal expulsions did not translate into practical reshaping of state behaviour because enforcement and great‑power support were missing (bullets 8, 11, 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The League’s capacity was not robust or impartial at this stage. The Soviet expulsion was one of the last high‑profile acts, but it occurred after the League had already been weakened by mass withdrawals, conquests, and the absence of key powers—so the mechanism was not effectively enforcing norms across the board (bullets 8, 11, 13).",

The Permanent Court could adjudicate legal disputes between parties consenting to its jurisdiction, but it was not designed to provide the kind of immediate political or military response needed in an act of aggression. Moreover, judicial processes are slower and dependent on consent, whereas the unanimity rule in the Assembly/Council directly hampered political decisions (see index 0 and index 4).",
                "2": "Plausible but not the best answer. The lack of a standing force was indeed a practical weakness, but it was the decision-making rule (unanimity) that often prevented the political will to authorize or organize collective measures in the first place. The absence of force mattered, but only after political approval—where unanimity was the main legal/political hurdle (see index 4).",

The bullet emphasizes that the League’s hybrid approach—combining technical assistance, norm-setting and coercive measures—was repeatedly constrained by geopolitical realities: notably the absence of crucial powers, domestic economic upheaval, and variable commitment to collective action. These factors undermined the credibility and enforcement capacity of coercive economic measures.",

The League lacked US financial and trade leverage (bullet 4) and no standing armed force (bullet 5). Moreover, European members often preferred bilateral bargains or protecting national interest over costly collective action (bullet 6), so relying on them alone overstates the League’s capacity.",

Great‑power politics and material leverage mattered greatly (bullets 3–5).

Structural rules (unanimity and voluntary sanctions) further reduced its ability to coerce recalcitrant states (bullet 6). Thus moral condemnation frequently failed to become effective coercion."

                "1": "Incorrect — This question foregrounds material analysis (paper, ink, annotations) and provenance work that, per the cluster, may require consultation of original physical items and paleographic techniques (bullet 2), so it does not minimize the impact of limitations.",
                "2": "Incorrect — This is a false assumption. The cluster urges careful integration of League records into analyses and notes limitations of digitization (bullet 2); digital availability does not eliminate the value of complementary national archival research (bullet 3).",
                "3": "Correct — This question leverages LONTAD’s clear strengths: digitization enables comparative, multilingual and cross‑regional study of debates and norm diffusion (bullet 1), and the archives are a crucial empirical resource for tracing how global institutional practices shaped actors in South Asia (bullet 3). It also avoids dependence on detailed provenance or paleography, which are noted limitations (bullet 2)."

It also emphasizes the continued importance of regional archives and contextual perspectives.",
