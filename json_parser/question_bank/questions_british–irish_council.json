Sending a technical delegation is useful but, when the UK is host, representation can vary (from PM to senior ministers) and sub‑state visibility can be lower than when the jurisdiction hosts (bullet 2). Reliance on UK representation risks diluting the island’s distinct profile.",
                "2": "Correct. Hosting the summit locally provides the Crown Dependency with the highest visibility because BIC practice rotates hosting across all member jurisdictions (including Crown Dependencies) and frequently selects symbolic venues (e.g., national cultural sites, government houses) to lend gravitas and public diplomacy impact (bullets 3 and 4).

A supranational secretariat with directive powers contradicts the BIC’s consultative, non‑supranational approach (bullet point 1) and would likely be politically unacceptable within a federal polity such as India, undermining state autonomy and the confidence‑building utility of a flexible forum (bullet point 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Sole reliance on ad hoc MoUs lacks the procedural regularity and public reporting that create predictable channels for confidence‑building and for identifying implementation gaps. The BIC highlights the value of regular communiqués and structured workstreams for continuity and accountability (bullet points 1 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While binding treaties provide legal enforceability, they are politically sensitive and often impractical at sub‑state or interstate levels where sovereignty concerns and domestic politics limit scope—precisely why the BIC model opts for non‑binding coordination (bullet points 1 and 2). Binding enforcement could impede rapid cooperation and deter participation by sub‑national actors.",
                "3": "Correct. This option mirrors the BIC’s legal‑institutional character as a consultative, non‑supranational forum whose outputs are typically non‑binding but enable coordination through regular workstreams and published communiqués that create accountability and allow longitudinal tracking (bullet point 1). The use of hosting patterns and symbolic venues is a strategic tool the BIC employs to project internal legitimacy and external messaging, useful for India’s public diplomacy in sub‑regional engagements (bullet point 2). This design balances political sensitivity (avoids formal treaty obligations), operational coordination (structured workstreams), and accountability (communiqués and reports)."

The BIC showcases the value of involving sub‑state actors and regional workstreams for practical coordination (bullet points 1 and 2).",

This option captures the BIC’s practical strengths: structured, non‑binding workstreams and provisions for extraordinary meetings—including virtual convening—facilitate rapid, predictable, multi‑level coordination and confidence‑building without the need for new treaties (bullet points 1, 2, and 4). Regular communiqués provide transparency and can guide implementation and public messaging during crises (bullet points 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Automatic deployment under binding mutual aid treaties might ensure swift action, but such treaties are often absent, politically sensitive, or too rigid for sub‑state coordination.

The cluster highlights that the BIC’s durability and comparative value stem from combining inclusivity of sub‑state actors, procedural regularity (summits, workstreams, communiqués) and operational flexibility via non‑binding coordination (bullet points 1 and 4). Comparative analysis with Nordic Council and Benelux (bullet point 3) is recommended to isolate variables enabling sub‑state engagement; this combination is the most plausible explanatory variable.",
