While greater institutional demands could follow a shift toward accession, the immediate and necessary legal/institutional change would not automatically be the creation of an independent secretariat. The EaP’s deliberate administrative choice to rely on the Commission and EEAS (Bullet 4) reflects flexibility rather than a rigid linkage that would force a secretariat; accession negotiations could be handled through existing EU bodies.",
                "1": "Incorrect. AAs and DCFTAs are tools to approximate EU rules and integrate partners economically (Bullets 5,6). Even with an accession promise, such agreements would remain relevant as instruments to align legislation and markets prior to any possible membership; they would not become obsolete.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although a clear accession prospect can incentivise reforms, the EaP experience shows reforms are contingent on many factors (domestic politics, conditionality, EU leverage). The EaP instead used targeted incentives (trade, visa facilitation) and conditionality (Bullets 4,5,7). An across‑the‑board rapid acceleration in all partners is unlikely given uneven engagement (e.g., Belarus) and differing domestic constraints (Bullet 3).",
                "3": "Correct. The EaP was deliberately designed without an accession promise (Bullet 0) and Russia explicitly criticised the initiative as encroaching on its sphere of influence (Bullet 2). Including an accession promise would likely heighten geopolitical tensions with Russia and undermine the EaP’s role as a multilateral forum responding to partner demand (Bullets 0,2). The design sought to balance deeper ties without a formal membership offer precisely to avoid that escalation (Bullets 0,4)."

Multilateral platforms are useful for peer learning (Bullet 5) but relying exclusively on them would reduce the EU’s ability to offer tailored incentives and technical assistance. Given Belarus’s specific governance limitations (Bullet 3), multilateral peer pressure alone is unlikely to produce sustained reforms.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Immediate suspension might signal firmness but risks driving Belarus further from engagement and reducing leverage for gradual reform; the EaP was explicitly designed to combine incentives and normative aims to promote gradual change (Bullets 0,4). Evidence suggests engagement conditionality (carrots + sticks), rather than total cut‑off, is more consistent with EaP practice.",
                "3": "Correct. The EaP operates on a dual‑track design combining bilateral tailored agreements (AAs, DCFTAs, sectoral cooperation) with multilateral forums (Bullet 5). Mobility and visa liberalisation under the EaP are explicitly contingent on benchmarks (Bullet 7). Belarus’s uneven engagement reflects governance concerns (Bullet 3), so a calibrated bilateral approach that ties assistance and mobility to measurable reforms leverages the ENP/EaP mix of incentives and conditionality (Bullets 4,5,7) while allowing targeted cooperation where possible."

A condition‑based engagement aligns with the EaP’s stated objectives of promoting democracy, governance and parliamentary dimension while acknowledging the political reality of an authoritarian partner (bullet 0).

The documented practice of the EaP suggests the EU’s most realistic and effective approach in such contexts mixes targeted assistance (supporting rule of law, public administration and civil society), quiet bilateral cooperation in technical domains (energy diversification, connectivity) and offering conditional incentives under a differentiated ‘‘more‑for‑more’’ framework (bullet points 3, 4, 5 and 6). This reduces the risk of public backlash or escalation that the great power could exploit (bullet point 5) while preserving channels for incremental reform and resilience‑building (bullet points 2 and 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. The EaP was not designed as a military/security alliance and large‑scale security guarantees or military assistance would both exceed its remit and risk direct confrontation with the neighboring power. Historically, the Summit track emphasised political association, economic integration and resilience rather than securitisation (bullet points 0, 2 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Offering full Association Agreements and immediate visa liberalisation irrespective of reform undermines conditionality and risks the Vilnius‑type backlash where outside pressure can override domestic decision‑making (bullet point 5). It also ignores partner capacity and political will (bullet point 4).",

Cutting off engagement and relying primarily on sanctions and public condemnation can close constructive channels (technical groups, civil society) that are crucial for sustained reform and may push the partner further into the great power’s orbit (bullet points 4 and 6).
