A centralised committee risks ignoring local contexts and reducing legitimacy.",

CTA’s Strategic Pillar I and the broader operational model (Bullets 0 and 1) promote consultative, evidence‑based, multi‑level policy processes that explicitly integrate farmers’, private sector, civil society, research institutions and vulnerable groups, coupled with capacity building to avoid tokenistic participation. Institutionalising funded multi‑stakeholder fora with capacity development aligns with these lessons and strengthens legitimacy and implementation.",

Regional trade liberalisation can create opportunities (CTA supports trade as part of upgrading, Bullet 2), but taken alone it risks exposing smallholders to competition and does not ensure inclusive market access or the domestic mechanisms (finance, aggregation, information, localized advisories) needed for them to benefit. Without complementary interventions the poorest may be further marginalised.",

Climate‑proofing production is necessary, but CTA highlights that resilience requires integrating smallholders into markets, improving finance and strengthening information/communication systems (Bullets 2 and 3).

This approach addresses digital divides, gendered barriers and local relevance, and builds lasting capacity.",
