This option reflects how observer status functions in practice: a flexible instrument that allows targeted cooperation (knowledge, funding, technical input) while explicitly preserving governance rights and preventing binding decision‑making (bullets 2 and 3). Defining sectoral scope (e.g., environment, maritime safety) balances benefits and integrity and aligns with CBSS practice of tailoring observer roles.",

The CBSS has historically engaged extra‑regional partners as observers to leverage expertise and resources (bullet 4 and 5), so exclusion is unnecessarily rigid.",

While observers commonly attend meetings and participate in working groups (bullet 1 and 2), granting full observer privileges without tailored limits risks diluting the host organisation’s governance integrity. The CBSS uses observer status flexibly to extend cooperation while preserving decision‑making (bullet 3), so unrestricted privileges are suboptimal."

Converting contested neighbours into full members would extend governance authority and could be counterproductive politically; observers provide a middle path to engage without granting decision‑making power (bullets 2 and 3). The CBSS has instead used suspension and observer roles as calibrated responses.",

Harmonising protocols before mapping capacities and establishing working groups is premature: standardisation should be informed by real capabilities and stakeholder inputs. The recommended sequencing emphasises mapping and pilots before finalising SOPs/data‑sharing agreements so protocols reconcile privacy, investigative needs and operational realities.",
                "2": "Correct. This sequence mirrors the recommended next steps: start with mapping existing capacities (to know what is available), then set SMART targets to guide action, create inter‑agency groups for coordination, pilot interoperability to test arrangements, harmonise protocols/data‑sharing based on lessons learned, invest in capacity building to scale up, secure blended funding to finance scaling, and establish independent monitoring and evaluation. It also reflects the Baltic Sea Region lesson of institutionalising multi‑sectoral cooperation and building interoperable, tested systems for resilience and protection.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While funding and training are essential, starting with blended funding and large‑scale training before mapping capacities risks misallocation and poor prioritisation. It also neglects piloting interoperability and setting SMART targets early—both recommended in the sequence—and runs counter to the macro‑regional lesson of testing mutual aid arrangements before scale‑up."

Blended funding is explicitly recommended: combining national budget allocations (ensuring ownership and sustainability) with bilateral/multilateral grants and targeted donor projects (providing seed money, technical assistance and risk sharing) allows pilots to be trialled and scaled.
