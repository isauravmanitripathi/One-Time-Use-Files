While bilateral outreach is useful, avoiding the UNHRC entirely forfeits the opportunity to contest narratives and mobilise multilateral support within the Council’s deliberative settings. The regular-session calendar provides predictable fora for such engagement (bullet points 1–4); wholesale non-engagement neglects a key multilateral avenue.",

Establishing a permanent, recurring agenda item fixes an enduring institutional space to examine a specific country/territory complex, transforming episodic concerns into routine parts of council work.

Operational secrecy and denial may delay scrutiny but do not remove legal accountability or reduce the risk of adverse findings; indeed, lack of transparency was a core criticism in the Goldstone episode (bullets 9 and 12).

Bullet 13 highlights institutional preparedness — robust, transparent domestic investigative mechanisms that meet international standards reduce the likelihood of adverse international findings and help preserve strategic autonomy.

Even though Myanmar is not a party to the Rome Statute (bullet 4), the ICC has argued it can assert jurisdiction over crimes with cross‑border elements (for example, deportation into Bangladesh) where the effects or part of the conduct occurred in the territory of a State Party.

Domestic prosecutions in Myanmar could in principle try individuals (bullet 3), but they depend on Myanmar’s cooperation and willingness to meet international standards of impartiality and due process—something the military leadership has categorically refused (bullet 6).

However, the 58 abstentions represented a substantial bloc reluctant to take a definitive position, revealing political divisions (bullet point 6 and 7). The state’s subsequent announcement of withdrawal but continued attendance as an observer shows that suspension has both symbolic and practical effects but does not entirely sever diplomatic engagement (bullet point 2 and 3).",

Abstentions are not equivalent to opposition; they do not count toward the two‑thirds threshold, and they often signal reluctance or political calculus rather than full support for suspension (bullet points 1, 6 and 7). Also, a GA suspension does not itself guarantee automatic prosecution (bullet points 4 and 5).",

Suspension from the HRC is a political and procedural sanction within UN bodies; it does not in itself compel international courts to assume jurisdiction or override national sovereignty.

The HRC’s invocation of “genocide” is legally resonant because the 1948 Genocide Convention creates obligations on states to prevent and punish genocide and to cooperate in securing those ends. Consequently, such language typically triggers calls for independent, impartial fact‑finding and mechanisms to assess whether the specific elements of the crime—especially intent to destroy in whole or in part—can be established. At the same time, HRC resolutions are generally non‑binding (bullet points 3 and 4).",

While a judicial body ultimately determines criminal guilt, the HRC’s use of the term is not purely rhetorical; it has legal resonance under the Genocide Convention and prompts fact‑finding and preventative obligations (bullet points 3 and 4).

Withdrawal by a major power is more likely to damage leverage than to galvanize decisive action (bullet points 1, 6, 7).",
                "2": "Correct. When influential states publicly rebuke the Council and withdraw (as the US did under the Trump administration), it undermines the institution’s perceived legitimacy and can reduce collective political will to act.

This approach reflects India’s cautious but engaged posture: attending to admissibility and confidentiality because of concerns about politicized allegations and federal implications, while using the Advisory Committee to influence normative development through technical expertise (Bullet Point 8).
