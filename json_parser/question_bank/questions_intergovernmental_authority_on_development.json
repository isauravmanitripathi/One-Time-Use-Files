Bullet points 2 and 3 indicate IGADD’s technical origins and the practical choice to place the headquarters in Djibouti; bullet point 3 explicitly notes long-term consequences for accessibility, diplomatic posture and administrative continuity. Bullet point 0 frames IGAD as a case study where headquarters location was one of the factors that helped transform a narrow technical remit into a broader political-security role by facilitating summit-level interaction and external engagement.",
                "1": "Incorrect. This understates the empirical effect described in bullet point 3: the headquarters choice produced long-term consequences beyond symbolism, affecting accessibility and diplomatic posture and thereby contributing to institutional evolution (bullet point 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While limited local resources can matter operationally, the IGAD case (bullet points 2 and 3) emphasizes that location affected diplomatic posture and continuity rather than deterministically constraining mandate expansion. The organisation ultimately expanded its scope despite the HQ being in Djibouti (see bullets 4, 5 and 6).",

Legal changes to mandate and membership occurred later via formal amendment (Letter of Instrument; bullet point 5).

Such a narrow approach risks missing transboundary drivers and the benefits of coordinated regional responses (bullets 3 and 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Bilateral trade deals may yield short‑term gains but do not address cross‑cutting security and disaster risks that are transboundary in nature. IGAD’s role includes regional trade facilitation and conflict prevention/management (bullets 4 and 6), and leaving security solely to national militaries overlooks the need for regional coordination and mediation (bullet 7).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Technical committees provide specialised inputs (bullet 5), but without political direction from the Assembly and Council the responses risk being fragmented or politically unimplementable. IGAD’s structure balances technical work with high‑level policy oversight to ensure coherent regional action (bullet 5).",
                "3": "Correct. IGAD has evolved from a narrow drought‑focused body into a regional organisation whose mandates explicitly link disaster management with development, trade and security (see bullets 0 and 4). Its institutional architecture (Assembly, Council, Secretariat, technical committees) and instruments (infrastructure planning, transboundary resource management, mediation and early‑warning systems) are designed to deliver integrated responses (bullets 5 and 6). An integrated regional approach therefore best fits IGAD’s expanded mandate and comparative advantage."

Bullet point 4 states that Eritrea’s 1993 accession reinforced geographic comprehensiveness and introduced new bilateral and multilateral dynamics that the institution needed to manage.

                "1": "Incorrect. Change from a technical to a political-security remit typically follows recognition of broader regional problems and high-level political momentum (bullet point 4), not an instantaneous shift caused solely by accession. Legal and summit-level steps were needed (bullet points 5 and 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Bullet point 4 contradicts this: accession did have tangible effects by introducing new dynamics. Moreover, the organisation’s substantive agenda did change, but through a process involving political recognition and formal amendment (bullets 4 and 5), not merely formal membership paperwork.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The evidence in bullet point 4 points to increased political diversity and the need to manage new tensions, not reduced diversity. New members usually add new bilateral issues and political complexity, which complicates consensus rather than simplifying it."
