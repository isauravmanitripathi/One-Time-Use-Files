                "1": "Incorrect — While higher yields may be achieved short term, this approach prioritizes uniform commercial varieties that can erode genetic diversity on farms, reduce dietary diversity and micronutrient availability (bullet 4 and 5), and increase vulnerability to pests, climatic extremes and market shocks (bullet 0).
