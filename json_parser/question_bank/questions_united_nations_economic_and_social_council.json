Given the one‑year, facilitative presidency (bullets 1 and 6), the most effective approach is to leverage agenda‑setting and convening authority to spotlight particular SDGs and to orchestrate inter‑agency and stakeholder consultations (bullet 7).

ECOSOC itself issues principally non‑binding policy recommendations that require political will and operational partnerships for implementation (bullet 1); specialized agencies provide the operational capacity to carry out those recommendations (bullet 3). Engaging NGOs with consultative status (bullet 6) helps build coalitions and amplify normative influence. Together these actions use ECOSOC’s real levers—agenda setting, technical input, partnerships and civil‑society engagement—without assuming powers ECOSOC does not possess.",

While regional commissions (bullet 5) can regionalize agendas and assist states, they do not have the power to issue binding mandates, nor can ECOSOC reliably coerce Member States through debate alone—ECOSOC’s outputs are chiefly normative and non‑binding (bullet 1). Relying on coercion overlooks the need for operational partnerships with specialized agencies to implement programmes (bullet 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. ECOSOC does not have authority to issue binding decisions that directly obligate Member States; its role is to produce principally non‑binding policy recommendations that depend on political will and partnerships (bullet 1). Bypassing specialized agencies ignores how operational implementation is actually carried out within the UN system (bullet 3). Centralizing implementation in the ECOSOC secretariat misunderstrands the division of labour across UN organs (bullet 0).",

Relying primarily on bilateral or donor projects external to the UN avoids leveraging ECOSOC’s comparative institutional strengths (agenda setting, normative leadership and consultative processes).
