The renaming in 1974 signalled three interrelated shifts: moving away from the short‑term, post‑war reconstruction focus toward longer‑term development planning and social policy; expanding the geographic scope (to include Pacific island states); and adopting an integrated economic and social mandate consistent with other UN regional commissions (see bullets 3 and 4).",

The commission’s evolution from a post‑war reconstruction body to an institution focused on integrated economic, social and environmental challenges (including capacity building and resilience) means its outputs—on economic stability, social development and climate resilience—are relevant to national and regional stability and thus to India's strategic culture (bullets 3, 6 and 7).",

The presence of major powers and politically sensitive membership (bullet 6) can politicise some issues, but many of ESCAP’s agendas (e.g., disaster risk reduction, SIDS finance) are technical and primarily affected by development heterogeneity rather than geopolitics.

Preserving a great power’s seat maintains the composition and voting dynamics of the Security Council, which matters directly for India’s security diplomacy, its bilateral manoeuvres with other great powers, and its campaign for UN reform. This reflects the point about Security Council politics and great‑power balance (bullet 1) and connects to how such decisions create broader precedents that affect regional security and norm‑building (bullet 4).",

Index 14 links development measures (health, supply chains, climate adaptation) to security outcomes rather than advocating militarisation of ESCAP’s platform; using ESCAP for formal defence pacts risks politicising the institution and undermining its technical-development role (Index 16).",
