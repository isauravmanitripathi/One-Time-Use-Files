Formatting errors can signal sloppiness, confuse interpretation, and undermine credibility with policymakers, so they should be addressed and documented."

This option embodies the bullet's recommendations: explicit definitional choices, standardizing or at least documenting temporal coverage, and acknowledging political asymmetries or omissions. These practices promote rigorous data hygiene and transparency, reducing misinterpretation and supporting cooperative outcomes."
