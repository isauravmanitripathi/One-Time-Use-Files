While bilateral agreements can yield short‑term gains for individual states, they fragment the Caribbean voice and undermine the ACS’s cross‑bloc strategy to present unified positions (bullet 2). Aggregating bilateral outcomes does not equal the coordinated policy dialogue and pre‑negotiation consensus building the ACS’s forums are meant to produce (bullet 4 and 5).",

This option reflects the ACS’s strategic approach of leveraging geographic proximity and regional cooperation to obtain advantage (bullet 2 and 3) and its institutional mechanism of using Special Committees, forums and project pipelines to build consensus and feed proposals into technical and financing apparatus (bullet 3 and 4). Targeted, issue‑based unity respects member diversity and is feasible given the ACS’s mandate.",

A single common external tariff and rapid supranational integration would theoretically strengthen bargaining by creating uniformity, but it runs counter to the ACS’s practical constraints: members have varied economic structures, tariff regimes and regulatory capacities (bullet 4 and 5). The ACS is designed to promote regionalism while acknowledging diversity; forced, rapid supranational rules are politically unrealistic and likely to fail."

This reflects the Convention’s availability in three languages and the membership’s linguistic plurality. (See index 1 on treaty availability in three languages; index 3 on membership and linguistic plurality; index 6 on Secretariat capacity.)",
                "1": "Incorrect. The ACS does not (and cannot practically) compel associate members or territories to abandon local languages. Instead it accommodates linguistic diversity via multilingual documentation and outreach—hence the need for Secretariat capacity in multiple languages. (See index 3 and index 6.)",
                "2": "Incorrect. While multilingual texts can create interpretive challenges, the ACS’s framework uses parallel official texts in three languages rather than creating a supranational adjudicative mechanism.

                "0": "Incorrect. Cross‑basin perspectives are presented as beneficial for comprehensive proposals, not as inherently undermining coherence. The cluster suggests they can improve regional proposals when coupled with formal coordination, so harmonisation is difficult but not impossible (Bullet 1 and Bullet 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. The cluster does not imply inevitability; it recommends formal governance tools to achieve alignment. Claiming observer networks always harmonise plans ignores political and institutional frictions that can persist without deliberate mechanisms (Bullet 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While funding and leadership matter, harmonisation is not conditional solely on India’s financial dominance. The cluster emphasises compact engagement, technical partnerships and formal coordination rather than unilateral financial leadership as the path to aligned outcomes (Bullet 1 and Bullet 2).",
                "3": "Correct. The cluster argues that observer networks should be used to coordinate proposals and formalise coordination (annual forum or joint secretariat) to reduce duplication and align strategic plans (Bullet 1). However, alignment is an outcome that depends on design, incentives and political will; it is not automatic. The synthesis (Bullet 2) presents the observer ecosystem as a template that can enable outcomes without over‑extending commitments, implying intentional design is required."
