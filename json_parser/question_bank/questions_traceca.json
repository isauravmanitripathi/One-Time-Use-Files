TRACECA’s Secretariat and donor architecture exist to coordinate projects and ensure integrated corridor development (bullet points 2 and 3).",

TRACECA’s core practical work is explicitly multimodal—covering road, rail, maritime and intermodal interfaces—and focuses on corridor development and logistics nodes to create faster, more cost‑effective links to Europe (bullet points 1 and 5). Coordinated corridor projects reduce bottlenecks across modes and borders, which directly addresses transit time and cost for a land‑locked state.",

Expanding national roads alone ignores the intermodal nature of international trade: without connections to rail and maritime ports and intermodal terminals, road improvements cannot by themselves knit the region into reliable links to European markets as TRACECA intends (bullet points 1 and 5)."

The cluster underscores the value of coordinated project planning and TRACECA’s role in harmonisation rather than piecemeal approaches (Bullet Points 1 and 3).",
                "2": "Correct. The cluster highlights the need for appropriately structured finance (Bullet Point 3). A blended model with IFI/donor concessional finance plus national commitments and performance‑based private contracts spreads risk and resources.

Bullet Point 13 explicitly notes that TRACECA’s working‑group institutional design offers a pragmatic template for India’s multilateral connectivity initiatives, emphasising the integration of sector specialists and diplomats and the inseparability of connectivity and security (customs, border management, anti‑smuggling).

The cluster identifies operational complexity—integrating customs, security screening and multimodal connections—as critical to preventing new bottlenecks (Bullet Point 3). Joint border management with harmonised procedures and shared processing converts physical capacity into efficiency while TRACECA’s coordination and technical standards aid harmonisation (Bullet Point 1). Inclusion of conservation protocols recognises the need to protect the historic asset (Bullet Point 2).",
