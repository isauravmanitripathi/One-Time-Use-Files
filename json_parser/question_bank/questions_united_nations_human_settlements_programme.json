Donor flows are influenced by mandate clarity, performance and political priorities, not merely headquarters location. The bullet points emphasize regional engagement, not guaranteed donor increases (bullet point 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While physical distance from New York/Geneva may affect proximity to some UN headquarters functions, the placement was a deliberate policy choice to enhance regional engagement rather than a surrender of institutional influence.

Colocation can create synergies rather than inevitable duplication; UN‑Habitat’s mandate and operational activities are distinct (urban development, slum upgrading, capacity building) and can complement UNEP’s environmental work (bullets 0 and 6). Duplication is a risk to be managed but not an inevitable outcome."

This sequence follows the practical recommendations in the cluster: verify the nature of membership (consult UN‑Habitat partners/affiliates registry — bullet point 3), map courses and research to priorities like urban resilience and disaster management (bullet point 3), engage through joint research and city‑level pilots to develop scalable demonstrators (bullet point 3), and institutionalize findings into training (staff colleges and civil services training — bullet point 4). This approach balances due diligence, targeted capacity building and mainstreaming."
