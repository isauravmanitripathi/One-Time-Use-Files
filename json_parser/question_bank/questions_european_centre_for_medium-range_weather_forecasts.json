The general case study of ECMWF shows the need to trade off scientific/technical needs, legal jurisdiction and political choices (bullet 0), while retaining multinational staffing and governance to preserve scientific capacity (bullet 4) and modelling outputs (bullet 2).",

Even though distribution can reduce perceived political friction, the ECMWF experience shows that evenly splitting expensive, specialised assets (like HPC and archives) can be inefficient and undermines economies of scale and model coherence (bullet 5). It also fails to address jurisdictional alignments required for programme funding/contracting (bullet 6).",

Locating all functions solely on scientific optimality ignores legal and contractual realities highlighted by ECMWF’s Copernicus move (bullet 6) and the political leverage host states exercise via infrastructure offers (bullet 5).
