India cannot quickly obtain DAC membership to alter norms for a single project, and the DAC’s authority is about donor reporting and ODA norms rather than case‑by‑case project eligibility (bullet 4).

This synthesis reflects the cluster’s theme that OECD partner initiatives shape standards but do not entirely displace bilateral options (bullet 0).",

Immediate full adoption without negotiation risks domestic revenue loss, misfit with India’s legal and administrative systems, and possible capture of policy choices by dominant member philosophies (bullets 1, 2 and 6). Phased, negotiated implementation is the recommended approach (bullets 2 and 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Ignoring OECD processes forfeits opportunities to negotiate protections and timelines via missions and the Secretariat (bullet 2), and underestimates the normative and practical effects of OECD standards on fiscal flows (bullet 1). Combining domestic reform with international engagement is superior.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Refusing participation sacrifices India's ability to shape timelines and technical modalities, increasing fiscal risk (bullet 2). The chapter advocates engagement—technical or negotiated—rather than outright rejection (bullet 6)."
