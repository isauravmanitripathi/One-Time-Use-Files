It also neglects how safety and regulatory harmonisation shape supplier behaviour (bullet 10, 13).",
                "1": "Correct. Strengthening and aligning domestic regulatory institutions with international best practice reduces perceived regulatory risk for suppliers and demonstrates India’s capacity to maintain high safety standards. This facilitates deeper technology cooperation and improves export competitiveness for Indian firms by making them credible partners in future international supply chains. This answer directly connects to the point that NEA members’ priorities (safety‑centric regulation) condition technology availability and contractual terms (bullet 10) and to the policy recommendation to strengthen domestic regulatory institutions to facilitate cooperation (bullet 12). It also engages the technocratic emphasis of NEA and the need to weigh it within India’s strategic choices (bullet 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Solely waiting for international consensus delays needed domestic reforms. Multilateral engagement (IAEA) is valuable (bullet 12), but postponing regulatory upgrades undermines near‑term procurement prospects because NEA suppliers prioritise demonstrable regulatory capacity (bullet 10). Combining domestic reform with multilateral engagement is the recommended approach.",

While industrial subsidies and procurement guarantees may support domestic industry, they do not address the supplier’s concerns about regulatory governance, safety culture or waste management that often dictate technology transfer terms. Without regulatory alignment, subsidies alone may not convince NEA suppliers to share advanced technology (bullet 10) and could weaken India’s standing in multilateral technical collaborations (bullet 12)."
