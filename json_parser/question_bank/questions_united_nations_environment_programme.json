Maurice Strong’s convening role and subsequent institutional shaping (bullet 1) and the use of coalitions and transitions (bullet 6) indicate that sustained environmental diplomacy, coalition-building, and institutional engagement are the most effective levers for a rising power.",

Bilateral and domestic measures are important, but the cluster emphasises UNEP’s role in shaping multilateral norms and treaties that alter state behaviour (bullet 0 and 6). Avoiding multilateral engagement would forgo opportunities to shape global norms and financing mechanisms (e.g., Montreal Protocol, bullets 3 and 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While having a national Executive Director could provide influence, appointments are made by the UN Secretary-General and reflect geopolitical calculations (bullet 5 and 6). Moreover, UNEP’s historical lessons (bullet 0 and 1) show that personalities catalyse agendas but sustained influence requires broader institutional and diplomatic engagement rather than single-person control.",

Financial contributions can matter, but the cluster points out that agenda influence often depends on informal coalition-building during transitions and managerial appointment processes (bullet 6).

Appointments are made by the UN Secretary-General (bullet 5) and lobbying the Secretary-General matters; however, the cluster emphasises that informal coalition-building during transitions is a standard and effective continuity mechanism for shaping agendas (bullet 6). Direct lobbying alone without coalition support is less likely to succeed.",

Maurice Strong converted the 1972 Stockholm conference momentum into a permanent UN environmental organ (bullet 0) and Mostafa Tolba later catalysed diplomatic action on stratospheric ozone that led to the Montreal Protocol (bullet 1).

Thus while important, it is less directly instrumental than mechanisms that produce political commitments.",

Bullet 10 explicitly states that implementation and legal potency vary according to member states’ political will, financial resources, technical capacity and the strength of secretariats and RACs, and that ratification thresholds and national implementation capacity shape outcomes as much as treaty texts.
