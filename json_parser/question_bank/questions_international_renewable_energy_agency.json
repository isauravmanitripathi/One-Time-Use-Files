Postponing technical follow‑up reduces the announcement’s substantive impact.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While legal enforceability may be desirable, waiting for a binding treaty is unnecessary and contrary to the Day’s intended use. The UNGA resolution is non‑binding but creates political momentum and predictable policy windows that states routinely use for announcements (bullet points 3 and 4). Relying solely on treaty processes misses opportunities for timely finance and cooperation.",
                "2": "Correct. The International Day is designed as a predictable calendar moment for policy windows, public diplomacy and multi‑stakeholder events (bullet points 2, 3, 4, 5). Coordinating timing with IRENA’s technical network lends credibility and data support (bullet points 1 and 2), while inviting NGOs and partners concentrates advocacy and visibility (bullet point 5 and 6). This integrated approach uses the Day’s political legitimacy and practical function as a coordination point.",

The Day is intended to function as a recurring political focal point for timed announcements and partnerships (bullet points 3 and 5); routine budget timing is less likely to attract international partners or media attention."

While aligning the Day with IRENA links it to an existing technical and policy network (bullet points 0 and 1), a plausible governance risk is that excessive reliance on one institution could centralize agenda‑setting and potentially sideline alternative technical views or actors not integrated into IRENA’s processes.

Bullet Point 1 emphasises state and non‑state interaction—not exclusive private governance—as central to IRENA’s creation.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Although permanent statutes and a centralised HQ provide long‑term clarity, Bullet Point 1 shows that insisting on fully settled arrangements delayed operations; instead, interim mechanisms allowed IRENA to function while members negotiated details. Starting rigidly could stall formation and exclude less powerful or diverse states.",
                "2": "Incorrect. A rotating temporary secretariat without interim rules would likely produce operational chaos and uncertainty. Bullet Point 1 highlights the importance of interim legal instruments to manage activity during institutional infancy; ad hoc decision‑making would undermine credibility and continuity.",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet Point 1 explicitly lists mechanisms—Preparatory Commission, interim rules and decentralised site arrangements—that enabled IRENA’s rapid operationalisation while managing member diversity.

Bullet Point 1 recommends transparency and clear rules rather than privileging specific states—exclusive privileges risk politicisation and reduced legitimacy.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Informal power‑sharing may stabilise leadership short‑term but increases opacity and risks capture by a few states. This runs counter to the lesson in Bullet Point 1 advocating transparent processes and clear interim governance to safeguard national and collective interests.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While seconding civil servants can build capacity, mandating only state‑seconded officials risks undermining the agency's technical independence and may not prevent turnover or politicisation. Bullet Point 1 emphasises transparent recruitment and interim rules rather than rigid composition rules that could weaken operational quality.",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet Point 1 highlights early governance fragility and leadership turnover, underscoring the need for transparent recruitment and clear interim rules. Such reforms institutionalise fairness, reduce patronage risks, and protect national interests by making selections predictable and procedurally defensible during formative years."

                "1": "Correct. Bullet Point 1 underscores that participation in knowledge production (like Rethinking Energy), technical assistance, capacity building and data products reduces information asymmetries and accelerates deployment while shaping norms on just transitions and technology transfer. Bullet Point 2 frames these as actionable lessons for India to leverage international expertise for domestic transformation and to influence global governance—so an integrated approach combining co‑production, domestic capacity building, data sharing and pragmatic diplomacy is optimal.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Domestic success is important but Bullet Point 1 and Bullet Point 2 argue that actively shaping multilateral knowledge and governance is necessary to influence norms and secure supportive mechanisms (e.g., tech transfer, financing). Norm‑shaping does not automatically follow domestic demonstration without proactive engagement.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Bilateral technology imports can speed deployment but bypassing agency knowledge production forfeits influence over global norms and limits access to shared data, capacity building and multilateral leverage described in Bullet Point 1.

Mobilising finance is important, but without parallel reforms to permitting, grid integration and regulatory frameworks (bullet point 5 / Index 4) and reliable resource data (bullet point 3 / Index 2), investments face higher risk and may not materialise or be efficient.

This set operationalizes the integrated monitoring called for.",
