While flexible funding can be valuable for rapid response, the 'Other' aggregate in the dataset is sizeable and shows a pronounced 2016 spike that obscures precise sectoral allocation (index 4).

Transparency and reporting improvements are important (index 1), but delaying necessary programme funding until further reporting refinements are achieved would neglect urgent capacity and security gaps.

The largest single sector over 2012–2016 is security system management and reform, and public sector policy/administrative management is also one of the top three sectoral totals (source: bullet index 3). The steady rise in commitments indicates growing programming scale (index 2). Combining security sector reform with administrative capacity building addresses both coercive and administrative dimensions of state resilience (index 5) and leverages UNDP's existing emphasis on governance and rule of law. This integrated approach is therefore most likely to strengthen institutional stability and resilience while aligning with where UNDP has concentrated resources."

Delegating implementation to international partners undermines the governance and state‑capacity goals emphasised in bullet 11 and runs counter to bullet 12’s note that India prizes institutional robustness and strategic autonomy.
