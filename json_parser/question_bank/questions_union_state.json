                "2": "Incorrect — The membership clause exists (bullet point 1), but the presence of an accession mechanism does not itself prevent supranational legislation; the main impediments are legal sovereignty and the treaty‑based, coordinating nature of institutions (bullet points 1 and 2). Moreover, accession has proven politically improbable, so it is not the strongest immediate constraint.",

Which inference for India’s policy‑making is most justified by the cluster’s combined lessons?",

                "When entering defence agreements, India should prioritise legal clarity, institutional choice and domestic legitimacy to avoid unintended loss of autonomy and regional cascading reactions.",

                "0": "Incorrect. The cluster does not claim that all bilateral pacts inevitably cause permanent loss of sovereignty; instead it highlights trade‑offs and suggests alternatives (modular ties, legal safeguards) for states unwilling to forgo autonomy (bullet 5 and 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Secrecy does not eliminate signalling; clandestine arrangements can still be discovered and may worsen mistrust. The cluster emphasizes transparency, parliamentary oversight and clear language to manage domestic and external reactions (bullet 6 and 4).",
                "2": "Correct. This inference synthesizes multiple bullets: the treaty’s consolidation and predictable operational/geopolitical effects (bullet 7), the sovereignty versus integration trade‑off (bullet 2), the need for meticulous legal articulation and parliamentary oversight (bullet 6), and the signalling/regional effects (bullet 4). Together they justify prioritising clarity and legitimacy to manage autonomy and regional reactions.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Emulating the Union State model would likely produce lock‑in, reduce flexibility and potentially provoke regional balancing; the cluster presents this as a cautionary example rather than a template for India (bullets 7, 3 and 1)."
