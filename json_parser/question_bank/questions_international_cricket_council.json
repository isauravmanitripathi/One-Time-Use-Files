While MCC centrality helped found the ICC (bullet point 2), consolidating all powers in a single body would reproduce imperial hierarchies and likely alienate emerging cricket nations—precisely what later institutional evolution (membership categories) sought to redress (bullet points 4 and 6).",

Promoting combined sub‑regional teams can be useful in certain contexts (the East Africa example in 1968 shows this path—bullet 4), but it is a narrower tactic and does not replace the wider diplomatic benefits of engaging individual new members to build durable coalitions (bullet 0).",
                "2": "Correct. The 1964 decision to admit non‑Test countries and the first Associates in 1965 created new interlocutors within the ICC. Engaging these new members through coalition‑building and development support is precisely the kind of soft‑power strategy highlighted in the cluster (bullet points 1, 3 and 0). It leverages expanded membership to increase influence without needing formal political power.",

Commercial innovation—such as the 1971 idea for a limited‑overs World Cup—was indeed a strategic tool for raising cricket’s profile (bullet 6). However, as a tactic for India’s diplomatic influence specifically, direct relationship‑building with new members better exploits the institutional opening created by admitting Associates (bullets 1 and 3)."

The admission of East Africa as a combined Associate illustrates the ICC’s willingness to accept non‑state or sub‑regional representation, a move linked to broader processes of decolonisation and regional diplomacy where new or small polities sought international sporting recognition (bullet 4).

The scale and cost reduce the marginal diplomatic return relative to alternatives.",

Hosting a revival of a women’s marquee event offers high symbolic diplomatic value (gender equality and progressive image), is strategically novel, and is likely to be politically and publicly resonant without the same massive scale and cost of senior men’s World Cups (bullet 0).

The ICC’s two‑tier, multi‑year league (bullets 0 and 1) creates predictable incentives and reduces transaction costs (bullet 5), rewarding boards that build sustained administrative competence and infrastructure. Long‑term investment is therefore the strategy most aligned with the league’s design and with maximizing chances of promotion and subsequent benefits.",

Combining a public spectacle (which mobilises domestic cohesion and commercial attention) with diplomatic outreach converts symbolic gains into tangible soft power — influencing foreign publics, attracting investment, and enabling nation branding — while also producing governance benefits like coordinated security planning for events and strengthened domestic institutions. This mirrors the bullet's assertion that awards matter beyond trophies by influencing diplomacy, cohesion, commercial flows and security planning.",

Allowing foreign governments to nominate Indian candidates would be operationally odd and could create perceptions of external influence, but it is not a typical or practical risk.

Such a layered approach addresses technical vectors (wearables) while preserving due process and sponsor confidence (bullets 0, 4).",

Leaving primary responsibility to national law enforcement ignores the transnational and sport‑specific intelligence needs the ICC recognised when creating the ACSU (bullet 2).

Sole reliance on turf maximises realism but is costly in maintenance, risks overuse of limited turf resources (20 pitches may still be insufficient if mismanaged; bullet 1 & 2) and sacrifices the availability advantages of synthetic nets (bullet 3) and indoor analysis (bullet 4). Extended hours to avoid overlap could lead to fatigue and diminishing returns, and may not be feasible operationally.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Using synthetic nets exclusively would maximise throughput but sacrifices match realism essential for high‑performance preparation (bullet 2), and outsourcing the gym work reduces integration of sport‑specific conditioning and rehabilitation (bullet 4). This approach undermines the GCA’s dual elite/development remit (bullet 0) and its value proposition to teams seeking turf simulation and on‑site high‑performance support.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While protecting turf quality is sensible, segregating the associate nation to synthetic and off‑site gyms undermines the GCA’s development mandate to serve associate nations (bullet 0). It also forgoes benefits of integrated camps—coaching exchange and reputation gains—and may be politically counterproductive. A mixed scheduling approach is more inclusive and efficient.",

Staggered timetabling addresses simultaneous usage and overlapping camps to maximise utilisation (bullet 1 & 2) while keeping costs reasonable by leveraging the lower‑maintenance synthetic surfaces for bulk work."
