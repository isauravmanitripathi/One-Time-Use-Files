                "1": "Incorrect. Narrowing activities generally discourages middle-power engagement because such states often seek platforms where they can exercise influence through operational commitments and agenda-setting. The Rio example shows middle powers engage when institutions have adaptable, substantive mandates.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Becoming a military alliance is not the necessary or likely outcome; the Rio case points to the need for combining security and non-security cooperation rather than converting into a pure military bloc.",
                "3": "Correct. The Rio analysis warns that failure to adapt mandates to globalization results in marginalization: the forum cannot address non-traditional threats (migration, cyber, health) and thus loses relevance. Institutional adaptability is essential to remain effective."

This option mirrors the Rio approach: using forums for political reintegration through preparatory-level agenda-setting, middle-power-led operational engagement, and phased confidence-building—methods that balance reintegration with credibility. The example of Cuba’s reintegration in Rio-type processes illustrates this gradual, platform-based strategy.",

The Rio experience shows middle powers use regional platforms strategically without wholesale surrender of sovereignty; reintegration and operational commitments are negotiated and calibrated.",
