Open-lake dosing would be inefficient, more likely to affect non-target organisms, and fiscally infeasible.",
                "1": "Correct. Targeting larvae in tributaries is both cost-effective and ecologically justified because sea lampreys spend most of their lifespan (often 3–7+ years) as concentrated, identifiable ammocoete (larval) populations in stream sediments; eliminating larvae prevents recruitment into the parasitic, fish-killing stage and yields outsized benefits for lake fisheries. Operational lampricide use (e.g., TFM) and tributary-scale interventions are designed for this purpose, allowing focused application, monitoring, and repeatable adaptive management (see bullets 1 and 2 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Stocking predator fishes does not address the root cause: sea lampreys directly parasitize and kill large predators, and without reducing lamprey recruitment, stocked fishes would suffer high mortality. Stocking can be a supplemental fishery management tool but is not a cost-effective substitute for controlling lamprey larvae concentrated in tributaries (bullets 0 and 1).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Habitat restoration yields long-term ecosystem benefits but does not immediately reduce lamprey recruitment; because larvae are concentrated and long-lived in stream sediments, delaying direct control until funding allows restoration would allow continued parasitic recruitment and further collapse of fisheries. The recommended operational focus is targeted tributary treatments that can be repeated adaptively while restoration proceeds (bullets 1 and 2)."
