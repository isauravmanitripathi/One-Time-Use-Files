The PLG’s remit explicitly includes practical issues such as climate response, maritime issues and development (Bullet 2 and Bullet 3), which can and do require legal and policy commitments. The mixed legal capacities therefore have practical implications beyond cultural symbolism.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Although the PLG provides a unified forum (Bullet 0), it was intentionally non‑treaty based (Bullets 4 and 5) and includes territories without sovereign treaty‑making capacity (Bullet 1). That prevents the Group from acting as a single international legal actor that can bind all members.",
                "2": "Correct. Bullet 1 and Bullet 2 emphasize that the PLG was created to give a distinct institutional voice while deliberately mixing sovereign and non-sovereign polities. Because some members lack full international legal capacity, the Group cannot unilaterally bind all members to international treaties—binding commitments depend on each member’s legal capacity or the assent of their administering powers.",

Bullet 1 cautions that differing international legal capacities shape external interactions, so automatic treaty extension is not a safe assumption."

The cluster points out that maritime resources (EEZs, fisheries) and migration/economic coordination were central concerns (bullets 1 and 2). Economic asymmetries and the cost of sustaining institutions were problems, but resource value existed — the issue was uneven capacities and external interference rather than no incentive at all (bullets 2 and 3).",

This option synthesises the core reasons identified across the historical moments: an enduring cultural impulse for a Polynesian‑bounded regionalism (bullet 0) met structural constraints — nineteenth‑century imperial encroachment and later institutional competition from established Pacific organisations (bullet 3) — as well as persistent practical problems like geographic dispersion, economic asymmetries among islands and the costs of maintaining interstate institutions (bullet 3). It captures both motivational and constraining factors referenced in the cluster (bullets 0 and 3, with the conclusion that the two moments trace an enduring aspiration — bullet 4)."

Bullet point 0 frames India’s interests around climate, maritime governance, resilience and diaspora dynamics — areas where capacity-building and technical cooperation yield tangible benefits. The pandemic-era shift to a resilience theme (bullet point 2 and 3) shows PLG prioritises non-military, adaptation-oriented cooperation. Working through PLG and targeted mini-lateral partnerships recognises both the group’s regional role and the practical hosting/implementation realities (bullets 4 and 5) — e.g., some members host repeatedly and logistical hubs (Auckland) are important — so India’s posture should be sustained, region-wide, adaptable, and oriented toward civil/security-diplomacy rather than exclusively military approaches.",

A mixed approach that builds bilateral ties while supporting PLG-wide initiatives is more effective (see bullet point 0 on strategic implications)."

                "1": "Correct. Bullet 16 highlights that rotating leadership affects continuity and agenda‑setting; bullet 17 draws direct lessons for India: respect local titles and institutional forms, plan for operational complications from frequent rotations, and base programs on verified, current records. This option integrates those points and prescribes practical mitigations.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While bilateral ties are important, dismissing multilateral engagement ignores the role of small organizations and local legitimacy. Bullet 17 argues for culturally informed constituency analysis and respect for institutional forms rather than sidelining multilateralism.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Avoiding political or institutional capacity work ignores strategic opportunities to build durable relationships; bullet 17 recommends culturally informed and verified approaches rather than withdrawal from institutional engagement."

                "1": "Correct. This option follows the detailed corrective and investigatory actions in bullet 14: verify the meaning of fields, recover missing entries using recommended sources (bullet 15), resolve anomalies (e.g., Tokelau) by consulting primary records and separating titles, then normalize formatting and add explanatory notes with citations. This sequence ensures accuracy, transparency, and policy relevance (bullet 17).",
