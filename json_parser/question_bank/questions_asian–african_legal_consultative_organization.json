AALCO Centres maintain panels of qualified arbitrators adapted to regional contexts (bullet 2 and 3), but they are international institutions intended for cross‑border disputes and typically apply rules that respect international arbitration norms. The choice of substantive law is a party decision and not constrained to the supplier’s domestic law; emphasising only local arbitrators and domestic law misstates the Centres’ role (bullets 1–3).",
                "2": "Correct. This option synthesizes the core advantages described in the AALCO Scheme: regionally based institutions provide proximate venues and panels adapted to Asia–Africa contexts (bullets 0–2 and 2–3), which can reduce travel and transaction costs (bullet 2). At the same time, AALCO Centres were designed to align procedure with international standards so awards remain enforceable internationally (bullet 2 and 3).",

While host governments have often extended privileges and immunities to the Centres (bullet 4), this does not equate to an absolute bar on judicial review or challenges of awards in all national courts. Immunities are variable by host state and concern institutional independence and operational privileges rather than blanket extraterritorial immunity of awards (bullet 4)."
