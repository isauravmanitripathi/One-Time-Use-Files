              "explanations": {
                "0": "Correct. The CRPD’s rapid uptake resulted from a combination of factors: active state diplomacy (e.g., Mexico and New Zealand’s leadership), sustained DPO participation operationalizing “nothing about us without us,” and a strong normative consensus around equality, accessibility and participation (bullets 0, 3, 4, 5). These combined political leadership and civil-society legitimacy were crucial to achieving quick and broad ratification.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Narrowing scope to avoid contentious issues may secure short-term agreement but undermines the rights‑based thrust that made the CRPD broadly acceptable. During negotiations, contestation over equality, accessibility and participation shaped bargaining (bullet 3), and the eventual comprehensive scope contributed to the treaty’s legitimacy and widespread ratification (bullet 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While states and organizations sometimes engaged in esteem-seeking during negotiations, the CRPD’s success depended on institutionalized civil-society participation and coordinated state leadership rather than uncoordinated prestige competition (bullets 3 and 4). Over-reliance on prestige without civil-society buy-in risks weak implementation and limited legitimacy.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Early UN activity (1971–1993) relied on non‑binding soft law that proved insufficient to secure full rights protection (bullet 1). The move to a binding treaty was driven by recognition that soft law alone was inadequate (bullet 2), so postponing a binding instrument would likely slow progress rather than accelerate ratification."

It also reflects guiding principles such as autonomy, participation and non‑discrimination (bullet 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect — Emphasising medical rehabilitation and professional decision‑making preserves the medical model and limits autonomy. CRPD obligations go beyond medical care to encompass civil and political rights, reasonable accommodation and support for decision‑making so persons can exercise legal capacity (bullets 2, 3 and 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect — While funding and social protection are important, relying on segregated institutions and guardianship is contrary to the CRPD's paradigm shift away from charity and custodial models toward agency, autonomy and inclusion.

The critique ignores substantive issues of cybersecurity, transparency and privacy posed by assistive electronics (bullet 7 index6) and the continuing need for multiple modalities—low‑tech braille/tactile, physical accessibility and safeguarded assisted voting—to achieve full inclusion (bullets 4, 5 and 6).",
                "2": "Why option A is incorrect: This overstates technology’s reach. While electronic aids (audio, screen readers, tactile overlays) can restore autonomy for many voters (bullet 3 index2), they introduce significant security, transparency and privacy risks that must be mitigated (bullet 7 index6). Additionally, some voters may rely on braille or other low‑tech methods (bullet 4 index3), and a universal ban on assisted voting could exclude those for whom electronic options remain unsuitable.",
