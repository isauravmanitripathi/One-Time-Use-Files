Combining insulation for the scientific apparatus with formal government representation balances credibility and policy influence.",

The early CIESM model paired oceanographic knowledge with fisheries outcomes (bullet 1); focusing only on economics would neglect essential scientific inputs for sustainable management.",
                "2": "Correct — Vinciguerra and Krümmel’s proposal explicitly linked coordinated oceanographic work to improving the fishing industry (bullet 1).

Thus delimitation around the basin does not strictly exclude adjacent or non‑coastal participants (see index 3).",

The formal relocation of the headquarters to Monaco by 1970 (bullet 3) is a symbolic geographic shift, but codified governance (bullet 4)—including French as the official language—suggests cultural-linguistic influence persisted.

                "0": "Incorrect. The cluster emphasises that institutional memory and long rhythms contribute to resilience (bullet 13). It is unrealistic to assume structure alone ensures rapid replication; historical depth and sustained practice matter, so the claim that history is irrelevant is not supported.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The cluster indicates CIESM influences norms and policy through scientific authority and partnerships but does not guarantee immediate binding treaties. CIESM’s strength is in soft power and translating science into policy inputs rather than creating instant legal obligations (bullets 12–13).",
                "2": "Correct. While CIESM’s design features (epistemic communities, mixed membership, UN partnerships, institutional rhythms) foster influence (bullets 10–13), the Indian Ocean’s intense geopolitical competition could undermine perceived neutrality and constrain collaboration. Bullet 12 notes CIESM’s soft-power role through routine, non-coercive means, but that presumes a political environment amenable to scientific diplomacy; in highly contested theatres, such mechanisms may face limitations.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The cluster describes mixed membership as an advantage that extends influence beyond formal treaty circles (bullet 12), not as an automatic marginalisation of extra‑regional contributors. The problem is more likely political contestation than the inherent structure of mixed membership."
