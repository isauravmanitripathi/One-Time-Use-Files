                "1": "Correct — This option captures the economic role of subordinated (junior or mezzanine) financing: it sits behind senior debt in the repayment hierarchy and absorbs losses first, creating a loss‑absorption buffer that lowers expected losses for senior lenders and can produce a rating uplift for senior debt. That uplift improves perceived creditworthiness and helps mobilise institutional capital on commercial terms (see bullet points 3 and 4 and the EIB objectives in 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect — Subordination changes loss allocation between creditors, but it does not selectively transfer political or regulatory risks solely to mezzanine investors. Those risks remain part of the project's risk profile; subordination primarily affects credit hierarchy and expected loss for seniors (bullets 3 and 4).",

Increasing paid-in capital strengthens capitalization (bullet 2, bullet 3), which is one factor rating agencies consider (bullet 4). A stronger capital base can marginally improve creditworthiness and borrowing terms, enabling the Bank to mobilize more absolute lending. However, because the EIB uses a leverage model (bullet 3) — issuing bonds and relending proceeds — the leverage ratio (loans per euro of paid-in capital) could change even as absolute capacity grows.",

The official's claim omits key caveats: guarantees create contingent liabilities that can become real fiscal costs if loans default, and mobilisation depends on private bank appetite — guarantees do not ensure lending if banks retrench. Therefore guarantees are not risk‑free alternatives to nationalisation and require careful governance and monitoring (combines policy rationale, contingent liability and operational challenge points).",

The Roadmap and just transition approach (bullets 3, 4 and 6) explicitly target public investments, regional support and social measures as well as private sector mobilisation, so public entities and strategic infrastructure will also be affected.",
                "1": "Incorrect — The characterisation of an immediate and total withdrawal is exaggerated. The EIB announced an end to financing new fossil fuel projects (bullet 4), but that does not equate to an abrupt pullout from all existing investments. The realistic effect is a structural tightening of future finance for fossil fuels and a gradual reallocation to low‑carbon projects (bullet 5), not an instantaneous crisis.",
                "2": "Correct — The EIB’s deliberate shift to Paris‑alignment and its fossil fuel exit (bullets 0, 1, 4, 5) signal a reorientation of public finance norms that can reshape global financing architecture. This will make it harder for projects inconsistent with a 1.5 °C pathway to secure public backing and will create incentives to pivot toward renewables, grid modernisation and other low‑carbon investments (bullets 3 and 4). For Indian actors, this changes the envelope of available international public finance and influences how private capital is mobilised, with implications for strategic energy choices and national security planning.",

The Bank’s decisions can reshape private investor expectations and global capital flows; therefore, India’s financing environment and strategic calculations are likely to be affected."

The West Building’s monumental design and purpose-built facilities embodied institutional consolidation (bullet 1 and 0) and provided administrative infrastructure for expanded operations (bullet 5). Symbolic visibility and administrative capacity combine to enhance legitimacy and negotiating credibility with governments and other multilateral banks (bullet 6), facilitating translation of political aims (enlargement, cohesion) into financed projects (bullet 0 and 7).",

Bullet 10 states that multiple offices in one country often reflect distinct mandates—Ankara versus Istanbul is given as an example where one may be political liaison and the other a commercial or origination hub. For Indian stakeholders this distinction matters: governmental cooperation and policy dialogue are best handled through the political liaison, while project negotiation, origination and private‑sector deals are managed through the commercial hub.
