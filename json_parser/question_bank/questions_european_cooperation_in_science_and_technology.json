                "2": "Incorrect. The dossier describes COST as an open, intergovernmental science cooperation mechanism focused on transparent networking activities; it is not a vehicle for classified acquisition or evasion of procurement norms. Suggesting it be used for clandestine transfers misunderstands its stated purpose and governance expectations (Bullets 0, 2 and 6).",

The dossier explains that the COST Association’s principal instrument is investigator‑led, transnational ‘COST Actions’ that fund networking activities—conferences, meetings, short‑term missions and training—to maximise mobility and knowledge exchange, and explicitly does not fund primary research or major capital equipment (Bullets 2 and 3). This model is attractive for science diplomacy and building collaborative research capacity without the overhead of funding large projects (Bullet 0)."

This design directly responds to the fragmentation noted in the 1960s and the need for collective capacity (bullet 0, bullet 1).",

While strategic and defence considerations informed the urgency to act (bullet 0, bullet 1), COST’s chosen instruments were open, cooperative and civilian-focused (networking, mobility), not secretive defence programmes. COST emphasised harmonisation and exchange rather than classified command structures (bullet 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Private industry-led consortia were not COST’s primary vehicle. COST was an intergovernmental mechanism intended to link national public research systems and create shared agendas, complementing rather than replacing public or private funding (bullet 2, bullet 6, bullet 7).",

That centralised execution enables speed and operational coherence — useful for time‑sensitive engagement — but because preparation (EB) and execution (Administration) are closely linked within a central structure (bullet 2, bullet 3), it also concentrates responsibility and raises the need for safeguards (e.g. transparency, conflict‑of‑interest controls).",
