                "0": "Incorrect. This mixes accurate elements (Marshall Plan/OEEC influence and later NATO/Warsaw Pact developments) but misstates sequencing and causation. The EDC (a supranational defence proposal) never became a reality in the early phase; NATO had already been established in 1949 and the Warsaw Pact formed in 1955 (Index 6). The immediate institutionalisation of bipolarity in 1948–50 rested more on the Allied Council’s paralysis and the reciprocal creation of Western and Eastern institutions (Indexes 1–3), rather than a single set of military treaties alone.",
                "1": "Incorrect. These institutions were important to postwar reconstruction (Council of Europe, OEEC, Ruhr authority — Indexes 4, 2) and to proposals for defence (Pleven Plan — Index 6), but this option omits the crucial role of the Soviet boycott and of explicit Eastern bloc responses (Index 1 and 3) that consolidated the bipolar order. It therefore does not fully explain the transition from wartime cooperation to bipolarity.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While the Hague Congress and Council of Europe (Index 4), OEEC (Index 2), ECSC (Index 5) and the ECHR contributed to Europe’s normative and institutional evolution, they were not the primary, immediate causes of the shift from wartime collaboration to an institutionalised East–West bipolarity. The decisive turning points in 1948 were political/security breakdowns and reciprocal bloc institution‑building (Indexes 1, 2, 3).",
                "3": "Correct. The sequence described in option A captures the immediate mechanisms that converted wartime cooperation into a bipolar order: the 1948 Czechoslovak coup crystallised Western fears (Index 1), the Soviet boycott of the Allied Control Council incapacitated the wartime administrative mechanism for Germany (Index 1), Western states responded with security and institutional measures such as the Treaty of Brussels/Western Union and Ruhr arrangements (Index 2), and the Soviet counterpoint — creation of Comecon — institutionalised an Eastern bloc economic order (Index 3). Together these developments created parallel Western and Eastern institutional structures and hardened the bipolar division (Index 0)."

Conditionality and monitoring are core to the accession process: chapters are closed only when benchmarks are met so that the candidate can implement the acquis effectively after accession.

Supranational jurisprudence (bullet 12) shapes the legal environment, but it does not in itself prevent micro‑supervisory action—the practical limitation stems from the allocation of micro‑supervisory powers between EU bodies and national authorities (bullet 10).

This answer synthesises the core critiques: legal instruments like Article 7 require high procedural thresholds and therefore grant leverage to the targeted state; political divisions among members and the diplomatic costs of escalation further reduce the mechanism's deterrent potency (bullet points 2 and 3). The result is that activation is slow, costly and often ineffective in practice.",

Some backsliding states (e.g., Hungary) can be economically significant and thus wield influence; the main issues are procedural thresholds and political divisions (bullet points 2 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The EU does possess formal legal instruments (e.g., Article 7, infringement procedures); the problem is not absence of instruments but the political and procedural hurdles in using them (bullet points 2 and 3).",

This answer synthesises the EU lessons: India’s strategic culture (emphasis on sovereignty and non‑interference) may favour informal persuasion and incentives, but the EU experience also shows that credible, rule‑based conditionality, monitoring, capacity‑building and distributional management improve long‑run institutional resilience (bullet points 12, 10 and 11). A hybrid approach balances political feasibility with effectiveness.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Purely avoiding governance engagement may limit political costs short term but neglects the role of norms, conditionality and institutional measures in building long‑run resilience. The EU example suggests that doing nothing on governance forfeits leverage to shape stable, rule‑based regional orders (bullet point 12).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Wholesale replication of EU legal mechanisms ignores India's differing strategic culture and the political costs and practical difficulties the EU faces in deploying Article 7‑style tools (bullet points 3 and 12). It risks diplomatic backlash and may be politically infeasible in India’s neighbourhood.",

Unconditional assistance and open mobility build goodwill and soft power (bullet point 11) but, without monitoring and capacity‑building, carry risks of capture, clientelism and brain‑drain (bullet points 1 and 11).
