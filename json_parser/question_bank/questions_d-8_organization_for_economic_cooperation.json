Sudden removal of subsidies is a blunt instrument that can exacerbate short‑term poverty and inequality, conflicting with the D‑8 focus on socio‑economic development and targeted social policy measures (bullets 0, 5 and 6). It also violates the cooperative, dialogic approach stressed in the founding principles (bullet 2).",

Establishing a Statistical and Investment Facilitation Unit within the existing Istanbul Secretariat aligns with the D‑8’s purposes of trade facilitation and investment promotion (bullet 1/2) and leverages the Secretariat’s coordinating role (bullet 2/3). It also directly addresses the documented data‑consistency problems—by producing clear, membership‑consistent datasets and investor guidance that state whether Azerbaijan is included and the reference years (bullet 4/5). This creates an actionable foundation for attracting FDI and designing trade measures.",

The D‑8 was established to deepen cooperation among countries that do not have identical economic structures (bullets 0 and 1). Jumping to a customs union would likely fail politically and economically without first addressing heterogeneity and information asymmetries.",

This option matches the strategic logic in the source material: the Roadmap target is a political ambition (Index 10) and achieving it depends on sectoral focus (Index 11) plus infrastructure, regulatory harmonisation, customs/logistics and financing (Index 12). A phased, targeted approach reduces risks from base-year or commodity price effects (Index 8) and builds genuine connectivity and value-chain integration needed for durable trade expansion.",

While tariff liberalisation can lower border barriers, doing it alone without concurrent infrastructure and regulatory alignment is unlikely to deliver sustainable or equitable gains. Bullet (Index 10) emphasises that the $500 billion is a declared ambition needing evidence, and Bullets (Index 11) and (Index 12) show that sectoral priorities (agriculture, energy, transport) require infrastructure investment, regulatory harmonisation and customs/logistics improvements—elements postponed in this option.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Exchange-rate and subsidy-led measures can produce short-term trade increases but are vulnerable to macro volatility and do not tackle the underlying barriers to intra-regional trade (infrastructure, harmonisation, customs). The source emphasizes the need for targeted project implementation and financing (Index 12) and warns that nominal trade growth can reflect price/exchange effects (Index 8), so relying on such measures is insufficient."

This option aligns with the strategic points in the cluster: NPRI offers a mechanism to internationalize innovation but exposes IP governance as an interface between economic diplomacy and security (Bullet 7). TTEN emphasises licensing, matchmaking and commercialization but requires harmonized legal regimes and financing instruments (Bullet 8). A targeted framework with IP reciprocity and vetting preserves the benefits of access and commercialization while guarding against leakage of dual‑use technologies and ensures reciprocal gains (Bullet 9). Conditional licensing and benefit‑sharing help address asymmetric gains and build trust among partners.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While open access speeds diffusion, it undermines the need for robust IP frameworks and reciprocity noted for both NPRI and TTEN (Bullets 7 and 8). Freely licensing sensitive or dual‑use technologies raises national‑security risks (Bullet 9) and can produce asymmetric economic benefits that disadvantage domestic industry and strategic interests.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Blanket export bans protect security in theory but are counterproductive operationally: they stifle commercialisation, prevent India from projecting leadership (e.g., in health or clean tech — Bullets 11 and 9), and undermine trust with partners. The cluster emphasises guarded, governance‑based approaches rather than blanket closures (Bullets 7–9)."
