While ALBA has a treaty label (see bullet 0), in practice its durability has been undermined by weak bureaucratic institutionalization and reliance on patron financing rather than legally enforceable supranational mechanisms (bullets 4 and 6). Thus the claim that ALBA ensures durable protection that will outlast patron changes overstates its institutional strength (bullet 7).",
                "1": "Incorrect. ALBA deliberately presents an alternative to liberalized, market‑driven trade (bullet 3). Its instruments include barter, preferential bilateral trade and non‑market mechanisms (bullet 3 and 5), so it does not primarily integrate members into market‑driven trade regimes.",
                "2": "Correct. This captures the central trade‑off set out in the cluster: ALBA delivers rapid socio‑economic outcomes through mechanisms like subsidized Venezuelan oil and social programs (bullet 5), but its cohesion and program continuity are heavily dependent on political will and major patrons, and it lacks deep bureaucratic institutionalization—making programs vulnerable to funding cuts and domestic turnover (bullets 4 and 7).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While ALBA’s ideology can limit cooperation with some U.S.‑aligned frameworks (bullet 6), it does not provide robust legal safeguards against funding cuts—the opposite is a key vulnerability (bullet 7). Also, membership does not automatically block all other bilateral cooperation."

Immediate, wholesale substitution of hard currency with barter/TCP transactions (bullet point 4, 5) is impractical and risky: TCP emphasises social objectives and preferential terms, but it was designed as a complement to, not a complete replacement for, monetary arrangements. Sudden elimination of currency use would strain complex multi‑sector trade and lacks the institutional scaffolding SUCRE aimed to create (bullet point 6/7).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While the Cuba–Venezuela oil‑for‑services model yielded rapid social provision (bullet points 3 and 4), replicating it exactly risks patron dependence and fiscal vulnerability for the patron state; figures around oil shipments and personnel are often cited but require verification (bullet point 4), and such one‑sided dependence undermines long‑term sovereignty and resilience (bullet point 0).",
                "2": "Correct. SUCRE was explicitly promoted within ALBA to reduce reliance on the US dollar (bullet point 6/7). Combining a regional payments mechanism with diversified partners reduces exposure to a single patron, while transparent institutional arrangements and limits on long‑term unilateral energy commitments address patron‑dependency and governance risks highlighted in analyses of ALBA’s energy diplomacy and barter mechanisms (bullet points 0, 5, 6, 7).",

A single patronage deal may deliver quick services (mirroring the Cuba–Venezuela foundation—bullet point 2–4) but increases political and economic dependence on that patron, reproducing the soft power/patronage concerns ALBA both exemplified and attempted to institutionalise against (bullet point 0).

Bullet 5 and 11 note ALBA’s responsiveness to leadership as a source of fragility; speed of decision‑making alone does not guarantee continuity or fiscal sustainability.",
                "1": "Incorrect. External outreach (bullet 10’s Russia example) can provide geopolitical signalling and occasional support, but inviting extra‑regional patrons without institutional safeguards risks politicizing the bloc and trading one patron dependency for another (bullet 12). It does not substitute for internal legal and financial mechanisms necessary for resilience.",
                "2": "Incorrect. High‑visibility programs (bullet 10 on Cuban medical diplomacy) produce legitimacy but do not create predictable institutional continuity. Bullet 11 cautions that many program claims lack independent verification; relying solely on soft‑power programs and patron funding perpetuates dependence (bullet 10) and vulnerability to patron shocks (bullet 11).",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet 7 highlights that ALBA functioned more as a political/programmatic alliance dependent on executive will rather than a deeply institutionalized organization. Bullet 12 explicitly recommends legal‑institutional depth (predictable dispute resolution, financing mechanisms) to ensure continuity across domestic political cycles. Diversifying funding addresses bullet 10 and 11’s warning about overdependence on Venezuelan subsidies and fiscal vulnerability. Together, binding rules plus diversified finance reduce fragility when regimes change."

This legal nuance is particularly important when engaging maritime-dominant members like Venezuela and Cuba (bullets 5 and 0).",

The EEZ does not confer full territorial sovereignty equivalent to land territory; coastal states have specific sovereign rights (resources, marine scientific research, etc.) but do not have blanket authority to exclude foreign warships from transit or impinge on all naval operations.
