Attempting a confrontational, Europe‑wide reconstruction programme would have collided with the political realities of the Cold War; polarization prevented comprehensive Europe‑wide programmes and would likely have rendered the commission ineffective or politically partisan (see Bullet Points 3 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Rather than being wound up, ECE adapted by narrowing to technical cooperation and later expanded after 1991. The commission’s persistence, rooted in operational assets and technical work, proved more effective than dissolution (see Bullet Points 2 and 6).",
                "2": "Correct. The ECE, confronted with Cold‑War polarization, deliberately confined its work to technical and sectoral topics of common interest (transport standards, statistical practices, technical cooperation) to preserve a neutral forum for cooperation. This pragmatic adaptation maintained relevance without triggering bloc confrontation (see Bullet Points 5 and 6).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Aligning with a single bloc would sacrifice the commission’s neutrality and its ability to act as a cross‑bloc technical forum. The historic ECE resisted such alignment and instead preserved an apolitical technical remit; alignment was the route the Soviet bloc took with COMECON and Western states with the OEEC (see Bullet Points 4 and 5)."

The presence of transcontinental and non‑European members (bullet points 4 and 5) and the resulting Euro‑Atlantic/Eurasian scope (bullet point 6) are the primary institutional reasons UNECE can serve as a bridge between European, Eurasian and North American regulatory regimes. This membership composition creates the political and technical network required for cross‑regional convergence.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Geneva as a headquarters (bullet point 2) offers logistical and diplomatic advantages, but physical location does not by itself enable cross‑regional regulatory convergence; the enabling factor is the diverse membership and the commission’s mandate to develop regional instruments.",

While the OEEC coordinated Marshall Plan reconstruction and provided practical capacity in the West, it did not function as a supplement to a neutral ECE; rather it became an alternative forum aligned with Western states.

The pattern of admissions (founding cohort in 1947; mid‑1950s enlargement; entries in the 1960s; large early‑1990s wave after the USSR and Yugoslavia dissolved; isolated later accessions) reflects an interplay of geopolitics (historical phases) and the commission’s functional needs.
