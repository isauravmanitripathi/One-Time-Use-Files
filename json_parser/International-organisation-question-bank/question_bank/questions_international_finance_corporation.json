                "1": "Why option A is incorrect: While an IBRD sovereign loan can provide finance, it increases public debt because it is sovereign‑backed and thus fails to preserve separation from public debt—a core IFC principle. It also does not directly mobilize private capital into the firm and risks creating contingent liabilities for the state (relates to bullets 0,4,5,6).",

It preserves public fiscal space while leveraging private capital and technical support.",

This option captures IFC’s distinct mandate: unlike IBRD/IDA that lend to governments, IFC works directly with private firms (from SMEs to large corporations) and through intermediaries (local banks, funds) using debt, equity and structured products to stimulate employment and market development (bullet points 2 and 4). That direct private‑sector focus was the gap IFC was created to fill (bullet point 3).",

This option captures the key trade‑offs: local‑currency lending reduces borrower FX mismatch and helps deepen local markets (bullets 4 and 5) but increases IFC’s market‑risk and hedging needs, often funded via swaps and innovative instruments (bullet 4).
