The historical record shows that while scientists generated and refined the idea (see bullet point 1, Index 0), the transition to a durable intergovernmental body required government engagement to provide legal personality, sustained funding and state commitments (see bullet point 5, Index 4).

                "2": "Correct. The cluster cautions that officer lists from secondary outlines may be outdated; such inaccuracies affect access, networks and institutional priorities. The recommended mitigation is to verify personnel and tenure data from NPMO’s primary records and plan contingencies that account for secretariat continuity (see Bullet Point 5 and Bullet Point 2, and relate to continuity issues in Bullet Point 1 and policy implications in Bullet Point 4).",
                "3": "Incorrect. The primary risk identified concerns personnel and tenure verification, not fabricated scientific datasets; wholesale re‑generation of datasets is neither necessary nor advised as the first mitigation step (see Bullet Point 5)."
