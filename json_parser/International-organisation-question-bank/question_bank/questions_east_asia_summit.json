                "1": "Incorrect — While consensus among a more diverse membership can make agreement harder, complete paralysis (no joint statements at all) is unlikely. The EAS has a track record of producing communiqués and joint statements even on sensitive issues, though these are often watered‑down (see bullets 4 and 5 on institutional character and outputs, and bullet 3 on expansion).",
                "2": "Correct — The EAS’s summit‑level, consultative character and decision‑making by consensus combined with limited bureaucracy (bullets 4 and 5) mean that inclusion of additional great powers (bullet 3) tends to broaden the strategic footprint but also produces politically significant yet non‑binding and often deliberately diluted statements rather than strong, enforceable outcomes. ASEAN’s procedures and centrality (bullet 1) further channel agenda‑setting but do not compel substantive enforcement.",
                "3": "Incorrect — The addition of the US and Russia increases political weight, but the EAS’s institutional design (summit format, consensus decision‑making, lack of enforcement mechanisms and strong secretariat — bullet 4) makes the rapid creation of enforceable multilateral security mechanisms improbable."

Given the EAS’s limited bureaucracy and non‑binding outputs (bullets 4 and 5), implementation is typically achieved through ASEAN structures, ministerial processes and targeted bilateral/plurilateral follow‑up—an approach consistent with how EAS initiatives have been operationalized (bullet 5 and the agenda areas in bullet 6).",

Yet consensus alone does not preclude rapid action when political will exists; operational capacity and administrative arrangements matter more for swift deployment.",
                "1": "Partially correct but not the strongest constraint — The summit orientation (bullet 4) means the EAS emphasizes high‑level political dialogue. However, many summit forums can trigger operational mechanisms through subsidiary bodies; the bottleneck for rapid disaster relief is more often administrative and logistical rather than simply the summit focus.",
                "2": "Correct — The EAS’s limited standing bureaucracy and absence of a strong separate secretariat (bullet 4), together with its reliance on ASEAN structures for follow‑up (bullet 4), are the principal constraints on rapid, operational disaster relief. Without dedicated administrative and logistical capacity, summits can produce helpful political statements (bullet 5), but translating them into immediate, coordinated field action is difficult (see also agenda relevance in bullet 6).",
                "3": "Incorrect — Annual sequencing after the ASEAN leaders’ meeting (bullet 1) shapes agenda‑setting but does not by itself prevent ad hoc or emergency meetings of relevant ministers or other mechanisms.

Inclusion of the United States and Russia in 2011 increased the EAS's inclusiveness and gave middle powers like India more room for strategic hedging and major‑power engagement (bullet 8 and 11). However, it also introduced greater complexity in consensus building and raised the management burden for ASEAN in balancing competing interests—consistent with the forum's symbolic and operational dual role (bullets 7 and 9) and ASEAN's procedural primacy (bullet 13).",

While U.S. interest in the region is relevant, there is no automatic causal chain that restricting EAS membership to the Plus Three would draw the U.S. deeper into EAS‑style multilateralism.

While consensus protects ASEAN’s inclusiveness, rigidly applying a full consensus requirement across all domains tends to lock the forum when membership is politically heterogeneous (index 0).

India can therefore pursue selective engagement in areas where its interests are best served without committing to the deeper financial integration projects that have characterised ASEAN+3 (bullet 4 and bullet 5). This captures both the opportunity (platform, influence) and the dilemma (managing overlap and commitments noted in bullet 0).",

While ASEAN+3 has developed important financial instruments like the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMI) and has been the forum for monetary cooperation (bullets 2 and 3), India is not a member of ASEAN+3. Moreover, the CMI’s existence shows capacity for crisis finance but not automatic access or political acceptance for new members to shape monetary integration; deeper monetary integration ambitions also ran into political limits (bullet 4). Thus immediate accession is neither factual nor the most realistic strategic assessment."
