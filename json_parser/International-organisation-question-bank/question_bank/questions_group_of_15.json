Bullet 4 explains that the G‑15’s minimal institutional design produces lower administrative costs and greater flexibility in agenda setting — useful for quick coordination. Bullet 5 shows the TSF in Geneva supplies essential research, secretariat functions and liaison with global institutions (WTO, UNCTAD), which is critical for shaping negotiating positions. Together they allow low‑cost, technically informed influence on North–South negotiations (Bullet 0 and 3).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Formalizing binding decisions and appealing directly to industrialized states shifts the forum’s nature away from South–South cooperation and undermines the G‑15’s role as a platform to shape North–South dialogue constructively (Bullet 1). The question demands an internally focused, low‑cost mechanism to coordinate developing countries’ positions, not external bargaining strategies.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Reliance solely on rotating leadership and ad hoc non‑state actor mobilization neglects sustained technical support. Bullet 4 warns that dependence on rotating leadership can weaken institutional memory and follow‑up; without the TSF (Bullet 5) research and liaison capacity will be limited, reducing effectiveness in complex WTO negotiations.",
                "3": "Incorrect. A heavy, permanent bureaucracy would increase administrative costs and contradict the G‑15’s pragmatic low‑cost approach (Bullet 4). It could improve continuity but is inconsistent with the resource‑constrained, flexible coordination the question requires."

The approach emphasizes coordination and amplification rather than binding enforcement.",

This option directly mirrors the practical uses listed in Bullet Point 1 (cluster index 0): constructing timelines, mapping host‑rotation patterns, identifying peaks of member activism, and tracing leaders’ involvement are the explicit methodological utilities of a summit breakdown. These uses are particularly suited to analyzing how a specific summit (e.g., New Delhi 1994) combined economic reform, leadership initiative and multilateral outreach to reshape strategic conceptions.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Bullet Point 1 and Bullet Point 2 (cluster index 1) suggest summit breakdowns are useful for mapping patterns and influences, not for mechanically predicting exact binding domestic policy enactments. Summits often influence agendas and signaling; they rarely guarantee immediate or precise legislative outcomes.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While trade data can be one of many outcomes to examine, Bullet Point 1 emphasizes structural and processual analyses (timelines, host patterns, activism, leader involvement) rather than treating summits mainly as instruments to measure short‑term bilateral trade fluctuations. Relying primarily on trade computations risks missing institutional and normative dimensions highlighted in the cluster.",

The cluster explicitly treats summit records as substantive sources for analyzing policy projection and strategic priorities (see Bullet Point 1 and the focus on the 1994 New Delhi summit).

Bullet Point 2 explicitly notes that India’s 1994 hosting occurred at a formative moment for its economic policy and illustrates using multilateral fora to project economic and strategic priorities. This interpretation captures the multicausal, projection‑oriented role of the summit.",

While external forums can influence policy discourse, Bullet Point 2 stresses that the hosting illustrated India’s use of multilateral fora to project its priorities during a moment of domestic reform and leadership initiative—not that reforms were entirely externally driven.

Bullet Point 2 points to both institutional strengths (trans‑regional convening capacity) and weaknesses (dependence on individual leaders and shifting global priorities). Institutionalizing processes—standing secretariat, clearer rules, continuity mechanisms—directly addresses those weaknesses by reducing reliance on episodic leaders and ad hoc agendas.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Strict alignment with dominant global institutions might increase short‑term visibility but does not solve the internal weaknesses identified (dependence on leaders, shifting priorities). Bullet Point 2 implies the need to learn from past failing rather than subsume the forum’s identity under larger institutions, which could erode the South–South purpose.",

Increasing reliance on charismatic leaders would perpetuate that weakness rather than mitigate it.

Bullet Points 1 and 2 emphasize broader conceptions of national security and strategic projection through multilateral outreach, which are not well captured by a narrow, immediate budgetary analysis.",

This question directly operationalizes the cluster’s claim (Bullet Point 1) by asking about mechanisms linking economic reform, leadership initiative and multilateral outreach to shifts in national security conception.
