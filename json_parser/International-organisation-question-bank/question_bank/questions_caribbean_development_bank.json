Concessional finance lowers debt burden for capital works, TA strengthens institutional capacity for maintenance, and targeted grants protect the most vulnerable—an integrated approach consistent with sectors emphasised by the Bank (infrastructure, climate resilience) (bullet 5).",

Recruiting nationals into CDB staff (Index 8) does strengthen regional ownership, cultural knowledge and representation, which can incrementally increase influence. However, staffing alone does not directly increase access to capital or immediate co‑financing resources; it is a longer‑term, indirect lever.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Non‑regional members are typically non‑borrowing and their role is usually filled by external states/institutions; a small borrowing member cannot realistically change its membership category by simply increasing paid‑in capital. Even if possible, formal classification changes are institutional and political, and may not be feasible or timely. This distracts from the practical mechanisms described in the bullets (Index 7).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Having a country office can improve oversight and responsiveness (Index 9), but lobbying to relocate a country office is a high‑cost, uncertain, and time‑consuming strategy. It may bring proximity benefits for one country but is unlikely to be approved merely to serve a single small member and does not directly secure additional capital or formal influence over Bank strategy.",
                "3": "Correct. Partnering with non‑regional (non‑borrowing) members leverages their capital, technical expertise and political support (Index 7). Such arrangements can improve project finance availability and broaden influence through co‑financing relationships and technical partnerships that increase negotiating leverage and access to resources."

Arthur Lewis combined concessional lending focused on agriculture and infrastructure with an insistence on administrative efficiency and institutional independence while engaging external partners such as the Inter‑American Development Bank and USAID to strengthen legitimacy and capacity, thereby exemplifying a regional multilateral response to the development finance needs of small states with design features and practices that bear on economic resilience and regional strategic stability.",

Strategic influence built through development finance and institutions aligns better with long-term stability (Bullet Point 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Conditional loans tied to procurement can provide short-term economic leverage but often undermine local ownership and legitimacy. The CDB’s emphasis on regional governance, administrative rigour, and partnerships suggests that influence derived from supportive, credible institutions is preferable (Bullet Points 1 and 2).",

Bullet Point 2 explicitly notes that larger external contributors can secure influence and regional stability by investing in regionally governed instruments rather than exclusively bilateral channels.

Symbolic features alone would not secure the legitimacy or functional partnerships that the CDB attained (Bullet Points 1 and 3).",

Its value lay in being sensitive to multiple currencies and small-state scales, not in imposing monetary union.

                "0": "Incorrect. Lack of harmonization does not automatically block access to multilateral funds—access is more directly related to accreditation and partner arrangements. The principal effect of non-harmonized procedures is higher administrative burden, not outright fund denial (Bullet Point 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While harmonization helps, it is not the sole determinant of measurable resilience outcomes. Other elements—such as readiness grants, accreditation, and institutional sustainability—also shape outcomes (Bullet Point 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although dealing with multiple procedures might spur some capacity building, unharmonized requirements typically overwhelm small institutions and raise costs rather than productively enhancing long-term sustainability; the CDB model recommends harmonization to ease burdens (Bullet Point 1).",
                "3": "Correct. The CDB lessons warn that without harmonization, co-financing arrangements can impose heavy administrative burdens on recipients, increasing transaction costs and undermining implementation even if financing is available (Bullet Point 1)."
