Which OLA division’s advice would be most determinative for the Secretary‑General’s high‑level legal position on these issues, and why?",
              "options": [

GLD indeed advises the Secretariat on many operational and administrative legal matters—including aspects of mission administration and privileges/immunities in practice (bullet point 3)—but when the decisive, organization‑wide legal interpretation that will guide the Secretary‑General is required, OLC opinions carry the heavier institutional weight (bullet point 2).",
                "1": "Correct. The OLC is the principal legal adviser within OLA and issues authoritative opinions to the Secretary‑General on high‑level questions such as mandate scope, immunities, privileges, responsibility and accountability (bullet point 1 and 2). OLC guidance frequently shapes the Secretary‑General’s course of action in contentious mandate and liability questions—precisely the issues in the scenario.",
                "2": "Incorrect. COD promotes codification and progressive development of international law and supports bodies like the ILC (bullet point 4). While COD shapes long‑term normative frameworks, it does not typically provide the immediate, authoritative operational opinions that determine a Secretary‑General’s position on a particular mandate or status‑of‑forces arrangement.",
                "3": "Incorrect. DOALOS specializes in maritime law and UNCLOS implementation (bullet point 5); it is relevant where maritime legal questions arise, but it is not the OLA division that issues the overarching authoritative legal opinions on mandates, immunities and UN liability for peace operations."

While OLC provides authoritative opinions on high‑level legal questions (bullet point 2), delimitation disputes heavily rely on technical maritime inputs and progressive normative work—functions primarily performed by DOALOS and COD. GLD’s role in contracts/procurement (bullet point 3) is peripheral to delimitation law‑making and technical boundary determination.",
                "2": "Incorrect. GLD addresses operational and administrative legal matters (bullet point 3) and DOALOS handles maritime issues (bullet point 5), but DOALOS alone cannot fulfil the role of shaping progressive international law—COD’s engagement with the ILC and normative processes is needed to influence long‑term legal development.",

DOALOS is the UN focal point for maritime law, offering technical assistance, capacity building, and guidance on UNCLOS implementation and maritime boundary issues (bullet point 5).

While OLA divisions issue legal advice, the description highlights their role in enabling targeted engagement rather than unilaterally imposing uniform positions on Member States (bullet point 0). The divisions provide specialised interlocutors rather than centralised coercive authority over Member States’ legal choices.",

The cluster description emphasises that OLA’s deliberately subject‑oriented internal organisation—six specialised divisions—covers advisory, operational, normative and registry tasks and that understanding this architecture is essential for states such as India for targeted diplomacy, treaty practice and operational engagement (bullet point 0). By engaging the right division (OLC for mandates and immunities—bullet point 1, GLD for operational legal issues—bullet point 2, COD for law‑making processes—bullet point 3, DOALOS for maritime matters—bullet point 4), India can tailor its legal inputs and negotiations effectively.",

                "The proposition is correct for bilateral treaties but not for multilateral treaties, because only multilateral instruments require public registration.",

                "0": "Incorrect. This understates the role of procedure. While procedures do not themselves create obligations, the Treaty Section’s recording and publication create legal facts (e.g., visibility, official date of signature/receipt) that have practical and legal significance.",
                "1": "Correct. This aligns with Index 18 and synthesizes the cluster: though largely procedural, depositary and registration functions are foundational—they convert diplomatic acts into lasting legal facts that are custodied, recorded and published, making commitments visible, verifiable and manageable.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Both bilateral and multilateral treaties benefit from registration and publicity. Article 102 and the Treaty Section’s functions apply broadly, and the claim that only multilateral instruments require public registration is false (see Index 17 and 18).",
                "3": "Incorrect. This is partially true but framed as the best evaluation it is weaker than option 0. The functions are procedural but their publicity and certitude can and do have durable legal and political effects (see Index 16 and 17)."

                "0": "Correct. This option draws on Index 15 and Index 17: reservations, declarations and interpretative statements can be used to define the legal effect of certain provisions; their registration and circulation fixes those legal positions publicly. This allows states to shape what is publicly binding while operational details that do not amount to formal treaty obligations can, where appropriate and lawful, be handled through other mechanisms, always mindful of Article 102’s transparency requirements.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Article 102 contains no general exemption that permits non‑publication on national security grounds. The publication regime is designed to bring treaties into the public international record (Index 17), so invoking a formal exemption is not a reliable legal strategy.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Relying on secret side‑agreements is risky and contrary to the transparency goals of Article 102; while such side‑deals have been used historically, they are constrained by the publicity regime (Index 17) and pose legal and political risks.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Avoiding signature or deposit to bypass registration is impractical if the parties want binding cooperation. Also, not signing sacrifices the legal framework and predictability that registration aims to secure (see Index 16 and 18)."
