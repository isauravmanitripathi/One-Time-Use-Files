While the Korean War did change political calculations and increased U.S. willingness to anchor Pacific security (see bullet 5), the specific omission of an automatic mutual‑defense clause is best explained by U.S. domestic constitutional concerns rather than operational tempo needs.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Australia and New Zealand, particularly under Spender’s leadership, insisted on a formal treaty rather than informal assurances precisely because they feared the temporary nature of executive promises. They did not favor informal guarantees (see bullet 3 and bullet 7).",
                "2": "Correct. U.S. negotiators were strongly influenced by domestic constitutional politics—Senate ratification and Congress’s war‑declaring powers—and therefore resisted treaty language that could be read as surrendering congressional prerogatives. This produced a pact that avoided an article‑by‑article automatic mutual‑defense clause (see bullet 5 and bullet 6).",

Attempting to allow US visits under inspections would have risked maintaining some operational ties but at the cost of undermining the government’s domestic legitimacy and provoking public backlash because inspections could not overcome US refusal to confirm or deny (bullets 2, 3, 5).",

                "1": "Incorrect. While alliances sometimes offer exceptions, the operational practices underpinning ANZUS — routine port access, naval interoperability and intelligence sharing — depended on partner predictability and the US policy of ambiguity. A narrow written exception would not have reconciled those operational needs with verification constraints (bullets 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Technically, if the US abandoned deliberate ambiguity, some reconciliation might have been possible; however, this underestimates the strategic reasons for US ambiguity and the near‑impossibility of a unilateral US policy reversal without wider deterrence consequences. Thus it was not a realistic or low‑cost solution (bullet 5).",

New Zealand’s approach (bullets 4, 5, 6) did preserve alliance ties with lower combat exposure and provided valuable interoperable capabilities.

This choice recognises the trade‑offs showcased by both countries: New Zealand’s niche, interoperable contributions offered political sustainability and operational value (bullets 4, 5, 6), while Australia’s large, diverse deployment provided scale necessary for intensive combat and broader reconstruction roles (bullet 3). Depending on mission demands (combat intensity, reconstruction needs, legal mandates — e.g. the role of UNSC resolutions in other contexts, bullet 2), either model may be preferable.

Domestic policy papers illuminate bilateral politics but excluding UN documents would omit the core legal authorization and international administrative experience critical to understanding the intervention and transition (bullets 10 and 7). A comprehensive analysis requires multiple source types (bullet 13).",

This option mirrors the recommended research approach (bullet 13): UNSCR 1264 provides the legal mandate (bullet 10), UNTAET reports cover transitional governance and institution‑building (bullet 7), official histories and defence white papers explain operational decisions by Australia/New Zealand, and operational accounts (e.g., Cosgrove) plus deployment records give tactical detail. Scholarly critiques contextualise militia behaviour and Indonesian involvement—allowing critical, multi‑perspective analysis and source bias assessment.",

Heavy mechanized forces for high‑intensity interstate warfare are important for other contingencies but are ill‑suited to stabilization tasks that require policing, civil‑military coordination, and legitimacy obtained through multilateral endorsement, which the bullet emphasizes.",

Domestic political consolidation is not guaranteed; interventions lacking legal multilateral backing can produce domestic controversy, legal challenges, and political backlash.

                "Limiting engagement strictly to trade negotiations and avoiding any military or logistical cooperation",

                "0": "Incorrect. Restricting engagement to trade ignores the strategic utility of practical defence cooperation; moreover the trade–security nexus can itself be leveraged negatively, so avoiding all military cooperation is neither necessary nor optimal for influence (Index 11).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Seeking immediate access to high‑end, especially nuclear technologies, risks legal and normative conflicts (as with New Zealand and AUKUS) and can compromise autonomy; ANZUS shows such high‑end integrations are exclusionary and politically fraught (Index 8 and Index 11).",
                "2": "Correct. The ANZUS case demonstrates that operational ties and interoperability can be rebuilt via AUSMIN dialogues, joint training, RIMPAC participation, port visits and HADR (e.g., Kaikōura response) without requiring convergence on high‑end capabilities or nuclear policies—this preserves autonomy while enhancing cooperation (Index 10 and Index 13).",
                "3": "Incorrect. A formal mutual defence treaty would constrain autonomy and may provoke domestic controversy; ANZUS’s evolution suggests alternative institutional mechanisms often replace broad treaty commitments when symmetry is absent (Index 11 and Index 13)."

                "1": "Correct. The post‑1985 ANZUS experience suggests institutional evolution toward bilateral mechanisms when trilateral symmetry fails, and demonstrates how practical cooperation can deepen ties without full convergence. A layered strategy—leading inclusive minilaterals for practical cooperation, retaining bilateral channels, and protecting domestic legal/normative constraints and trade policy—best balances influence and autonomy (Index 10, Index 11, Index 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Exclusive high‑end integrations (like AUKUS) can increase capability but tend to exclude partners and may conflict with domestic norms; the ANZUS lesson warns that such architectures can be asymmetric and politically divisive (Index 8 and Index 11).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Solely focusing on trade neglects defence and operational dimensions that shape regional influence; moreover the trade–security nexus can itself constrain policy, so security partnerships remain important if carefully managed (Index 11)."
