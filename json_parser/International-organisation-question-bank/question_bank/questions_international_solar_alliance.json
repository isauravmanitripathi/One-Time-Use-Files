The ISA emphasises solar and distributed solutions for access (Bullet 3 — index 2; Bullet 6 — index 5).",

A balanced strategy that combines centralised and distributed approaches addresses both capacity ambitions and access goals (Bullet 3 — index 2; Bullet 6 — index 5).",

Emissions intensity targets (India’s pledged 33–35% reduction — Bullet 5 — index 4) are important, but they do not by themselves resolve the operational challenge that capacity‑based targets can overstate actual non‑fossil generation (Bullet 7 — index 6). Thus balancing capacity deployment modes is the more immediate trade‑off in this context.",

While technology choice matters, ISA’s mandate and India’s targets are not about excluding wind; in fact the 175 GW target historically included wind (Bullet 4 — index 3). The more salient trade‑off for access and targets is centralised vs distributed deployment, not solar vs wind alone.",

PV converts global horizontal irradiance effectively (including diffuse and direct components) and benefits strongly from high GHI.

CSP’s principal technical advantage arises where DNI is high because CSP systems concentrate direct sunlight; when paired with thermal storage they can deliver dispatchable (firm) power and raise effective capacity factors and economic viability (bullets 1 and 3).

This sequence aligns with ISA’s three pillars: off‑grid/distributed solutions for immediate access using concessional and blended finance and standardized procurement (bullet 3); parallel investment in R&D and systems integration (storage, forecasting, grid flexibility) to handle intermittency as capacity grows (bullet 4 and bullet 6); and then scaling local manufacturing and industrial policy once demand, capacity and learning have developed to capture value chains (bullet 5).

While ideally both should proceed in parallel (bullet 12 recommends legal certainty and operational readiness), the question asks which has the more immediate effect on transaction costs and private investor participation. Operational tools (B) act more directly and quickly than securing treaty status alone."
