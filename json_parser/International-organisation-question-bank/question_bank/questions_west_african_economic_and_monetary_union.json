Given the 1962 arrangements—reserve pooling in an operations account in the French Treasury, an overdraft backstop, and France’s convertibility guarantee at a fixed parity—what is the most prudent short‑to‑medium term policy strategy for the member to preserve the peg and avoid a crisis?",

Combining temporary liquidity support with credible fiscal consolidation and conditionality preserves the peg and addresses the structural cause of reserve depletion.",

Abandoning convertibility and floating the currency would restore nominal monetary autonomy but at the cost of forfeiting the stability and external confidence provided by the French guarantee and reserve pooling (bullet points 2, 3 and 4). This is a drastic option with heavy economic and political consequences and is not the prudent short‑to‑medium term strategy when a regulated overdraft and conditional adjustment can be used.",

Direct central‑bank financing of the budget would increase liquidity in the short term but undermine the peg because the arrangement (reserve pooling, parity and convertibility) constrains independent monetary expansion.

This option captures the central trade‑off identified in UEMOA’s strategic implications (Index 13): unpegging grants greater sovereignty and flexibility in monetary policy but risks the loss of the credibility and stability the external anchor provides (higher inflation, exchange‑rate volatility), and it would affect geopolitical and investor relationships tied to the euro peg.

UEMOA already operates a diversified architecture with 32 international operating accounts across multiple countries and currencies (bullet 5), and the geographic/currency dispersion reflects the necessity to hold foreign assets to facilitate trade and manage cross‑border liquidity (bullet 6). Expanding and diversifying these operational balances is the most effective response to preserve smooth settlement.",

Although France’s unlimited convertibility guarantee (bullet 4) preserves a formal fiscal backstop, termination of the operations account (bullet 3) removed the operational channel for liquidity management (bullet 2). Relying solely on a political or legal guarantee without adequate transactional balances and reserves would leave the union exposed to immediate settlement frictions and operational shortfalls.",

Floating the CFA franc and eliminating reserve/settlement arrangements is an extreme policy shift that would increase volatility and require large reserves and strong market credibility to avoid disorderly depreciation. The union’s existing practice of holding diversified foreign assets (bullets 5 and 6) suggests the practical preference is to manage cross‑border liquidity rather than abandon coordinated arrangements.",

Attempting to recreate an identical operations account would likely be politically and legally difficult after the 2019 revision; moreover, the practical lesson from the change is the need for autonomous transactional capacity (bullets 2 and 3).
