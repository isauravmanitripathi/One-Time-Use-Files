A flexible, multi-speed architecture with opt-in, project-based cooperation acknowledges SAARC’s extreme heterogeneity (Bullet 1), allows smaller states to participate according to capacity and interest (Bullets 3 and 4), and addresses institutional feasibility noted in the cluster (Bullet 0). This balances Indian leadership capacity with respect for diversity.",

It also notes India’s dominance and smaller members’ suspicion of India preferring bilateral or sub‑regional mechanisms (Index 11 and Index 12).

Which combination best explains the transition from intermittent dialogue to formal institutionalisation?",

                "1": "Incorrect. The Soviet intervention (bullet 5) was a significant external shock that raised regional anxieties, but it did not on its own create an institution like SAARC. Domestic agency (Bangladesh, smaller states) and historical precedents were essential to convert shock into formal cooperation (bullets 1,2,4,6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While Bangladesh’s leadership (bullet 2) and resource concerns (bullet 4) were crucial, treating them as sufficient ignores the enabling role of earlier intellectual precedents (bullet 1) and the urgency imparted by the Afghan crisis (bullet 5). Institutionalisation typically requires both agency and conducive structural conditions; excluding either weakens the causal account (bullet 0).",
                "3": "Correct. The emergence of SAARC was not the result of a single cause but the interaction of several strands. Early post‑colonial forums (Asian Relations Conference, Baguio, Colombo Powers Conference) created an intellectual and diplomatic precedent that normalised regional dialogue even though they did not create institutions (bullet 1). Bangladesh’s diplomatic initiative after independence, and its unsuccessful bid to join ASEAN, gave agency and impetus for a South Asian vehicle (bullet 2). Smaller states’ practical concerns — especially shared resources like transboundary rivers as highlighted by Nepal — made concrete cooperation feasible across security divides (bullet 4). Finally, the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan acted as a security shock that increased the perceived need for regional mechanisms for dialogue and confidence‑building (bullet 5). Together these factors explain the shift from episodic dialogue to institutionalisation (bullet 0)."

Bullet 6 spells out the historical diplomatic sequence: Bangladesh led consultations among South Asian representatives at the UN in New York (Sept 1979–1980) and drafted a working paper; representatives met in Colombo in April 1981; foreign secretaries convened a Committee of the Whole in Colombo in Sept 1981 identifying areas for cooperation; and in 1983 in Dhaka foreign ministers adopted the Declaration on SAARC and launched the Integrated Programme of Action (IPA). This demonstrates a gradual, pragmatic, technocratic progression from idea generation to formal ministerial adoption driven by regional actors (bottom‑up and institutional learning), consistent with bullets 2 and 3."

A plausible unintended effect is centralisation of visibility around dominant languages/authors and misperception of FOSWAL's governmental status.
