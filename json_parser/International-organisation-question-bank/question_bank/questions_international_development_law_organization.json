IDLO gained diplomatic reach and normative influence (bullet 7), but expansion is contingent on resources, mandates and member state agreements rather than an automatic operational scaling or budgetary access.",
                "1": "Correct. The IDLO experience shows that conversion from an NGO to an IGO expanded diplomatic access and embedded the organisation within multilateral policy processes (bullet points 6 and 7). It also opened possibilities for more sustained state contributions and enhanced political legitimacy (bullet 6). However, formal state membership can bring political dynamics and constraints that shape programming choices—so benefits are accompanied by new governance and political trade‑offs (bullet 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The opposite is more likely: IGO status institutionalises state membership and can increase the influence of member states on priorities. IDLO’s case points to enhanced political legitimacy but also to greater involvement of governments (bullet 6), so autonomy from donor/state priorities is not guaranteed.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While IGO status brings prestige, IDLO’s transition produced concrete changes in governance, funding dynamics and policy influence (bullet 6 and 7).

                "1": "Incorrect. While judicial and prosecutorial strengthening could improve law enforcement effectiveness, IDLO’s programs emphasize accountable governance and rule‑of‑law principles rather than expanding military coercive power (bullets 1 and 2). The outcome described conflates capacity-building for civilian justice with militarization, which is not the typical downstream effect highlighted in the cluster (bullet 0).",

IDLO’s mandate to promote rule of law (bullet 0) and programmatic tools such as access to justice, judicial and prosecutorial training (bullet 2) are designed to strengthen civilian legal institutions and dispute-resolution mechanisms. Strengthened civilian justice institutions increase legitimacy and provide non‑coercive avenues for resolving grievances, which can reduce the military’s domestic role and improve civil–military relations.",

The cluster explicitly notes downstream effects on legitimacy and security institutions (bullets 0 and 2), so claiming no effect on civil–military relations understates the security relevance."
