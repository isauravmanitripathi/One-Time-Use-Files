Slow ratification and sovereignty mistrust (bullet 4) impede the formation of universal rules, which historically had led to episodic, crisis‑driven standard setting (bullet 3).

Collective action by small states cannot substitute for the tonnage threshold, so the system does not primarily advantage smaller states (bullet point 13).",
                "1": "Incorrect. The dual rule does not eliminate the need for iterative updating. IMO conventions frequently use frameworks plus technical annexes and later amendments to respond to new risks and technologies, so iterative amendments remain necessary (bullet point 13).",
                "2": "Correct. The dual entry‑into‑force mechanism increases the practical legal effect of conventions (by ensuring coverage of fleet tonnage) but can delay formal entry into force since both numerical and tonnage thresholds must be met—making monitoring of ratifications and tonnage essential. This reflects IMO’s institutional practice noted in the cluster (bullet point 13) and is evident in conventions such as MARPOL (bullet point 8).",

While ratification by large maritime states can satisfy tonnage thresholds, the dual requirement still necessitates sufficient numbers of states to ratify; it does not necessarily accelerate universal compliance.

Stronger safety oversight also contributes to fewer emergency events requiring national maritime authorities' responses (bullets 7, 10).",

                "1": "Incorrect. Hardware and technology upgrades matter but are insufficient without legal standards, inspections and enforcement mechanisms; governance reforms are necessary to ensure sustained compliance and labour protections, as indicated by the bullet point.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Industry-led mechanisms can contribute, but they often lack comprehensive coverage and enforcement necessary to protect seafarer labour rights and vessel safety for larger fishing vessels. The bullet point emphasises state-level governance and labour protection as central opportunities.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Diplomatic efforts to hasten entry into force are useful, but delaying domestic action until the Agreement becomes binding forfeits immediate opportunities to improve safety and labour protection. The bullet point suggests proactive domestic measures are valuable despite limited international legal reach."
