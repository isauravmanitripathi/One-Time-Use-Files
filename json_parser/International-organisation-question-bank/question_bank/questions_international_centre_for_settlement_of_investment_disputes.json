The ICSID Convention created a neutral multilateral forum for arbitration and conciliation and provided that awards under the Convention are generally binding with an enforcement mechanism among Contracting States (see bullet points 1 and 7). This structure reduces direct intervention by a respondent State’s domestic courts and enhances cross‑border enforceability.",
                "2": "Incorrect.

While the IBRD (World Bank) was instrumental in drafting and disseminating the Convention (bullet points 0 and 4), ICSID awards are not enforced by IBRD staff supervision.

While insulating disputes from domestic political pressures was an objective (bullet point 0 and 1), ICSID’s case‑by‑case method was motivated primarily by a substantive concern for factual justice and procedural neutrality rather than a decision to sacrifice predictability for politics (bullet points 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Correct. Broches intentionally designed ICSID as a neutral forum that would resolve disputes on a case‑by‑case basis through arbitration and conciliation to account for differing factual matrices; this flexible approach is defended as better able to deliver just outcomes tailored to individual circumstances, even if it may yield less doctrinal uniformity (bullet points 1 and 2).",

Although uniform standards can increase predictability, Broches rejected imposing generalized, uniform outcomes irrespective of differing factual matrices; thus the claim that uniform standards would be unequivocally superior ignores the trade‑offs he sought to manage (bullet point 2)."

The cluster synthesizes both perspectives: tribunals can make investors whole where domestic remedies fail (Index 7), but large awards provoke sovereignty and public‑interest concerns and intense political and policy reflection (Index 12). This balanced assessment explains why targeted reforms—transparency, ethics, appellate mechanisms, treaty rebalancing—are advocated (Index 9, 11).",

                "2": "Incorrect. This equally absolutist opposite ignores legitimate public‑interest and sovereignty concerns; defenders’ emphasis on investor expectations (Index 7) is only part of the picture, and the cluster emphasizes polarized reactions that drive reform debates (Index 12).",
                "3": "Incorrect. This absolutist position mirrors one side of the polemics (e.g., Jeffrey Sachs’ denunciation) but ignores defenders’ arguments that tribunals sometimes enforce legitimate expectations; the cluster describes a contested, not monolithic, view (Index 12, 7)."
