The transformation stemmed from a mix of domestic politics and public opinion that produced a categorical legal ban (bullets 1, 2, 5) plus the U.S. NCND policy: because Washington would not confirm whether a ship carried nuclear weapons or was nuclear‑propelled, the categorical nature of New Zealand’s law meant practically no U.S. warship could be admitted (bullet 3).

The cluster highlights that ANZUS demonstrates the interplay of domestic legal regimes, public politics and diplomatic instruments with military requirements; it advises watching how partners reconcile domestic constraints with emergent capabilities (especially under AUKUS), since mismatches can lead to unpredictable policy shifts (Bullet Point 2).",
