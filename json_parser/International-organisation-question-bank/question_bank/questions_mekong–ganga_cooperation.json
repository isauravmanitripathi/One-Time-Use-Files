Financing is important (bullet 5(b) and 6) and donor dependence can delay activities, but the question asks for the single institutional shortcoming most plausibly explaining lack of progress despite political backing. Even with imperfect finances, a designated focal point and secretariat can often prioritize, re‑schedule and mobilize resources; their absence more directly stops coordination and reporting (bullets 4–5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. A six‑year timeframe (bullet 2) aims to ensure continuity across electoral cycles and is a design strength rather than a cause of immediate project stagnation. The core implementation failure in this scenario is operational (lack of focal points/secretariat), not the existence of a medium‑term horizon.",
                "2": "Correct. Bullet points 4 and 5 emphasize that ministerial adoption provides political legitimacy but does not ensure delivery. Effective implementation requires designated national focal points and routine secretariat support (bullet 5(c)) to coordinate, report and maintain institutional memory. Without these coordinating actors, projects stall even with high‑level endorsement because no one is responsible for day‑to‑day follow‑through.",

The immediate institutional shortcoming that blocks implementation is operational coordination (bullet 5(c)), not ceremonial absence at reviews (bullet 3 discusses review rhythm importance but not as the primary operational coordinator)."

This option aligns with bullet point 1 (use of virtual SOMs shows adaptability) and bullet point 2 (the MGC’s strength is institutional continuity and soft‑power cooperation). Digital dashboards plus virtual meetings preserve consensus modalities while improving oversight and transparency.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Transforming the forum into a legally binding, majority‑voting entity would contradict the cautious, consensus‑oriented approach described in bullet point 2 and risks diminishing partner buy‑in.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Mandating in‑person inspections by a single lead country would undermine the MGC’s consensus‑driven, multilateral character (bullet point 2) and could be politically sensitive among Mekong partners.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Offloading oversight to external banks may speed implementation but would weaken the MGC’s institutional role and continuity (bullet point 2) and may reduce the diplomatic and soft‑power benefits India derives from the forum."

                "1": "Incorrect. The bullets describe the MGC as focused on soft‑power cooperation and institutional continuity (bullet point 2), not as an economic exploitation vehicle; this option mischaracterizes the forum’s stated orientation.",
                "2": "Correct. Bullet point 2 emphasizes India’s cautious, consensus‑driven, process‑oriented engagement and soft‑power focus — traits Mekong partners would find non‑threatening and reliable but possibly slow to achieve transformational outcomes. Bullet point 1 shows resilience but not necessarily rapid strategic impact.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The virtual SOMs in 2020 illustrate adaptation and continued engagement (bullet point 1), not unwillingness to engage. They maintained diplomatic routines and project oversight virtually."
