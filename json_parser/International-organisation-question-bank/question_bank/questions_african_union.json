The Constitutive Act emphasises both respecting member states’ sovereignty and pursuing collective action, reflecting a balance rather than an overriding of state authority (bullet point 2).",
                "2": "Correct. The Sirte Declaration and the launch of the AU signalled a conceptual move away from the OAU’s decolonisation and solidarity emphasis toward an organisation with explicit institutional ambitions — stronger governance mechanisms, accelerated political and socio‑economic integration, and active conflict prevention and management (see bullet point 1 and bullet point 2).",

While the OAU had limitations, the transformation was not a rejection of continental cooperation; rather it sought to modernise and institutionalise pan‑African objectives.

While the Abuja Treaty (referenced in bullet point 19) addresses economic integration, the AU's mandate (e.g., Constitutive Act) and subsequent policy instruments expanded into governance and human security. Reducing the AU to only economic matters ignores the broader institutional roles the AU now plays (bullet point 18).",

This aligns with the normative openness described in the cluster that legitimises Caribbean participation in AU-led policy dialogue (bullet points 0 and 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. The AU’s diaspora outreach is normative and programmatic (culture, remittances, reparations, development cooperation) rather than a security pact imposing collective defence obligations; nothing in the cluster indicates the AU would assume military commitments to Caribbean states (bullet points 0 and 1).",

Full AU membership with equal voting entails legal, constitutional and mandate changes and raises technical issues about representation and voting rights—matters flagged as requiring clarity to avoid mission drift (bullet point 6).
