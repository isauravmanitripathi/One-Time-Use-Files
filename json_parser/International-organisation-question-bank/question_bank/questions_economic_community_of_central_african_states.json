The cluster explicitly cites massive arrears that crippled Secretariat operations (index 3) and political-security fragmentation from conflicts in the Great Lakes and the DRC that produced opposing alignments among members (index 4). Together these two factors — financial incapacity and intra-regional conflict — most plausibly and directly produced the dormancy and loss of operational cohesion.",

The documented proximate causes are arrears and conflict (indexes 3 and 4), not simple expansion or bureaucracy overload.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Enlargement and economic heterogeneity can complicate consensus, but the cluster points specifically to financial collapse and security fragmentation — conflicts like the Second Congo War — as the decisive drivers of inactivity (indexes 3 and 4), rather than economic diversity per se.",

The revival efforts asked the Secretariat to obtain UNECA assistance, but the paralysis is attributed mainly to internal arrears and security fragmentation (indexes 3 and 4), not a sudden withdrawal of external support."

The cluster states Angola's move from observer to full member in 1999 was accompanied by creation of a Deputy Secretary-General post as a negotiated political concession (index 2).

BEAC is the regional central bank that can provide regional liquidity operations, not that it is prohibited from providing liquidity (bullet 2).

Moreover, national governments have limited ability for unconstrained monetary financing because of the union's institutional architecture and convergence expectations (bullets 0 and 2).",

This option synthesises several linked constraints: the Central African CFA franc (XAF) is pegged to the euro and is managed by the regional central bank (BEAC), which implies member states cede substantial national monetary autonomy and cannot unilaterally devalue (bullets 1 and 2). Because monetary policy and currency issuance are regionalised under BEAC, conventional national monetary responses (exchange‑rate adjustment, independent interest‑rate policy) are constrained (bullet 2). Fiscal responses are also politically and institutionally constrained by the monetary‑union convergence framework, making large deficit financing politically and institutionally difficult (bullet 2 and 0). These constraints are especially binding for oil‑dependent states facing commodity shocks (bullet 6).",

While regional integration aims to provide stability, CEMAC lacks an established mechanism of large, unconditional fiscal transfers across members comparable to a federal budget (bullet 0).

The progression from a five‑day deliberation producing a political non‑aggression pact in 1994 to a standing, ratified treaty establishing COPAX in 1999 reflects an incremental institutionalization — moving from ad hoc confidence‑building among a subset of states to a formal, treaty‑based mechanism for prevention, management and resolution of conflicts (see Bullet Points 0, 1, 2 and 3).
