The facts in bullet 1 show that eight states signed while Bolivia, Suriname and Uruguay abstained and Venezuela was deliberately not invited; PROSUR was publicly presented as an alternative to UNASUR.

Given that many secondary summaries require further verification (bullet 2), the recommended corrective measure is to consult primary documents (official communiqués or presidential speeches) and then use the formally accepted denomination(s), optionally clarifying translations in parentheses.
