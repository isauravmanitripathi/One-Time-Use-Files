Moreover, deferring technical compliance would conflict with the requirement members demonstrate effective export controls; India's accession required institutional strengthening prior to or alongside membership (bullet 10), and transfer of sensitive technologies is governed by export control practices and political judgment (bullets 3 and 12).",

This option mirrors the Chile lesson: regime membership is pursued for substantive control improvements and reputational signaling, and success depends on legal/institutional reforms, measurable plans, and continuous engagement with members (Bullet points 7 and 10). It also addresses the political dimension of consensus (Bullet points 8 and 9) by emphasising transparency and dialogue.",

The primary effect is to require both technical compliance and political acceptance.",

Bullet point 9 notes that delays or failures may reflect technical gaps or geopolitical considerations, showing how consensus can both protect regime standards and open the process to politicisation."
