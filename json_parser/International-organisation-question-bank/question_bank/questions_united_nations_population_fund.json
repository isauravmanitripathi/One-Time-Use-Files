This inference directly reflects Bullet Points 1 and 2: the combination of demographic analytics (UN DESA), normative guidance (CPD), and operational programming (UNFPA) influences resource allocation, service planning, and the framing of long-term security challenges—key concerns for strategic-culture analysts.",
                "3": "Incorrect. This is a common misconception. The bullets emphasize that population issues are not merely technical; they inform normative guidance and operational choices and therefore materially affect strategic framing and resource prioritization."

While India has domestic capabilities, Bullet Point 1 and 2 underscore the added value of UN analytics, norms, and operational programming that inform long-term security framing and resource prioritization. Domestic institutions may not fully replicate the global comparative analytics, normative consensus, or operational support UN bodies provide.",
                "2": "Correct. Bullet Point 1 highlights that institutional interaction at the UN level collectively influences how India anticipates risks and plans services. Treating entities as isolated severs the feedback loop between analytics (UN DESA), normative framing (CPD), and operational capacity (UNFPA), producing gaps in anticipatory capacity and implementation.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Although some policy autonomy may increase, the bullets indicate that losing integrated inputs from UN entities undermines anticipatory analytics, normative alignment, and operational options—diminishing, not enhancing, effective long-term planning."
