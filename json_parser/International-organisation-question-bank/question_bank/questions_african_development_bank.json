This option directly aligns with Bullet 13: supporting renewable manufacturing and grid infrastructure enhances climate resilience and stabilises supply chains by creating local capacity and regional integration.

Sustainable supply-chain stabilization requires infrastructure, capacity-building and policy reforms, not just short-term aid (contrasts with Bullet 13).",

This option captures the strategic consideration in the cluster: treating MDB procurement channels as extensions of economic diplomacy by encouraging Indian companies to bid in strategic regions and supporting them with information dissemination, bid-preparation assistance, credit and insurance.
