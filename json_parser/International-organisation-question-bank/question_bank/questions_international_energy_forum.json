Together they indicate a pattern: shocks produce fragmentation and mistrust, and subsequent instability or economic pain creates incentives to create formal cooperative mechanisms to manage expectations and reduce volatility.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While markets can adjust over time, Bullets 0 and 1 show that both shocks and gluts caused strategic and political problems (vulnerability, fiscal strain) that national ad hoc measures alone could not reliably resolve — hence the move toward institutional dialogue rather than reliance on self‑correction.",

Bullet point 11 highlights the Secretariat model anchored in a ministerial Executive Board and an annual Programme of Work as making the IEF a distinctive convening institution.

                "0": "Incorrect. While national measures (SPR, bilateral deals) are important, the cluster highlights the complementary role of JODI in reducing uncertainty and aiding coordination; it does not diminish the value of multilateral data (bullets 15 and 19).",
                "1": "Incorrect. The cluster treats JODI as a practical, policy‑relevant multilateral initiative, not merely academic. It recommends sustained engagement and using JODI proactively in diplomacy and market interventions (bullets 18 and 19).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The cluster argues the contrary—active participation yields substantive strategic benefits beyond passive receipt of data, including influence over standards, improved domestic decision‑making and diplomatic tools (bullets 16, 15 and 18).",
                "3": "Correct. The cluster explicitly states that JODI exemplifies how multilateral cooperation on information provision can reduce uncertainty, stabilise markets and strengthen energy security (bullet 19). For India, robust engagement is a pragmatic necessity and a way to shape the informational environment underpinning policy and strategic choices (bullets 15 and 19). Active participation and improving national statistics also enhance India’s influence (bullet 16)."
