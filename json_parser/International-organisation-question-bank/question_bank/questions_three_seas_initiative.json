It also addresses the geostrategic aim of reducing vulnerabilities by diversifying routes and suppliers (bullet point 6).",

Imposing tariffs is a trade policy instrument and would not directly remedy the infrastructural orientation or the single‑route/single‑supplier dependencies that 3SI targets.

Bullet 6 explains that although there is an associated investment fund and platforms to leverage capital, project implementation continues to rely on national budgets, EU funding instruments, multilateral development banks and bilateral arrangements coordinated under 3SI’s project pipeline. A blended-finance approach aligns with this multi-source, coordinated model and maximizes deliverability.",

A concurrent, phased approach recognises the complementary strengths of road (tactical mobility, dispersed routing) and rail (high-volume throughput, cost‑efficient heavy lift) and aligns with TSI’s multi‑modal transport objectives (bullet point 5).",
