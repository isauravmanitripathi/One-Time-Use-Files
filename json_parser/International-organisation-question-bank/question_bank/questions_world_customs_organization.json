It synthesizes the WCO’s instruments (HS, RKC, Data Model, SAFE) and activities (capacity building, operational cooperation) to achieve faster, sustainable trade facilitation and anti‑illicit trade outcomes (bullets 5, 6, 7).",
                "2": "Incorrect — Training and technical assistance are necessary, but implementing SAFE in isolation will not address underlying problems of inconsistent classification (HS), cumbersome procedures (RKC) or lack of data interoperability (Data Model).

The Revised Kyoto Convention (bullet 6) promotes simplified, standardized procedures and legal certainty, which help accelerate legitimate trade while enabling controls to be applied efficiently. Combined, SAFE provides the security architecture and RKC provides procedural facilitation; both are central to the dual objective.",

The Harmonized System (bullet 4) is crucial for tariff classification, trade statistics and customs automation, which supports trade facilitation, while SAFE provides security. However, HS does not address procedural simplification and legal frameworks the way the RKC does; without RKC-type reforms, facilitation objectives may be hampered despite classification improvements.",

The WCO Secretariat provides technical leadership and coordination (bullet 0 and 3), but it does not possess powers to impose binding sanctions or conduct cross-border policing.

RKC (procedural simplification) and HS (classification and statistics) together strengthen facilitation and administrative accuracy, but they lack the explicit risk-based supply-chain security mechanisms, electronic data exchange standards and public–private security partnerships that the SAFE Framework provides. Thus this pair would underperform on the security objective."
