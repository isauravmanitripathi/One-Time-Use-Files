While demonstrating commitment, this risks political backlash and fiscal shortfalls without safeguards or compensation (bullets 2 and 3).",

The Customs Union of 2010 changed transit dynamics (bullet 5), but infrastructure and bilateral transit agreements remained important practical constraints.",

The ‘four freedoms’ (goods, services, capital, people) were only adopted in principle with the Eurasian Economic Space in 2012 (bullet 6), and the Customs Union that removed many tariff barriers initially applied concretely to Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia from 1 January 2010 (bullet 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The EAEC’s evolution was largely intergovernmental and incremental rather than an immediate supranational transfer of sovereignty. Legal and institutional authority increased progressively (bullets 4 and 5), but member states retained substantial control and the supranational architecture of the European Union was not replicated instantly.",
                "3": "Correct. The EAEC followed a phased approach—coordination, then a Customs Union (2010) and later the Eurasian Economic Space with the ‘four freedoms’ (2012) (bullets 4, 5, 6). Joining in 2008 would most likely give access to harmonisation processes and customs‑related benefits where the Customs Union applied, while deeper liberalization and regulatory convergence would occur only later and unevenly."

It aligns with the Community’s operational logic of regulatory harmonization plus policy convergence to raise welfare (bullets 2 and 3).",

                "0": "Incorrect. Summit declarations demonstrate political will but, without following through with practical low‑politics measures and building institutions, they risk being cosmetic. The EAEU case shows summit politics must be backed by administrative capacity and institutions (Index 7).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Sudden full market opening may deliver economic gains but can generate severe domestic disruption and political backlash. The EAEU lesson recommends phased approaches to balance market benefits and political feasibility (Index 7).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Immediate comprehensive legal commitments can provoke strong domestic resistance and lack the administrative capacity or political consensus to implement them — a key caution from the EAEU’s lesson that sequencing and domestic buy‑in matter (Index 7).",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet point 1 (Index 7) emphasises that phasing matters: beginning with practical, lower‑politics measures such as tariffs and customs is a useful template to manage domestic resistance and build momentum before moving to legally binding, higher‑politics commitments."

Focusing only on security safeguards while refusing economic concessions precludes realising economic gains and does not address asymmetric dependencies arising from market integration; the EAEU shows integrated economic arrangements must be designed holistically (Indexes 7 and 8).",

This aligns with the EAEU lessons: balance market benefits and strategic costs by managing asymmetries (compensatory mechanisms), building safeguards, and planning for externalities and crises while proceeding incrementally from low‑politics to higher‑commitment stages (Index 7)."
