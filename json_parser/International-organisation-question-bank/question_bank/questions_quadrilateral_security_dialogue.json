Strict non‑alignment and avoidance of security cooperation would not address India’s genuine strategic anxieties—territorial disputes and Chinese military posture on the Tibetan Plateau—that make multilateral security conversations attractive. India’s own strategic culture combines balancing with engagement, so complete non‑alignment is unlikely and incongruent with the region’s security dynamics (bullets 9, 13).",
                "2": "Correct. The practical posture reflected in the 2008 episode is hedging: using informal consultative mechanisms (like the original Quad) and rhetorical emphasis on inclusive regionalism to manage strategic anxieties without provoking escalation. This preserves autonomy and economic ties while allowing security cooperation—consistent with India’s historical balancing and the durable pattern of hedging in the region (bullets 8, 9, 12, 13).",

              "question": "Between 2017 and 2022 India faced the challenge of reconciling long‑standing strategic autonomy with deeper cooperation in the Quad. Given the developments in that period (renewed meeting tempo, naval‑leadership engagement, ministerial meetings, Malabar expansion, and political legitimation), which policy approach best characterises India's posture within the Quad?",

The available evidence points to India maintaining its preference for strategic autonomy while pragmatically deepening cooperation — increased meetings (2017–2019), naval chiefs’ engagement at Raisina, ministerial meetings, Malabar's invited expansion, and political legitimation by leaders (bullets 1–6). This combination is best described as strategic hedging: selective, issue‑based cooperation without formal alliance commitments (bullet 0)."

The naval chiefs’ meeting at Raisina (bullet 2) was an early and concrete sign that maritime and security cooperation were central, showing sectoral deepening.

The Malabar invitation (bullet 4) signalled operational progression toward interoperability, yet it was an exercise‑level/defence‑operational step rather than a cross‑cutting institutional mechanism for regular policy coordination.

Joint standards for secure 5G and other emerging technologies (i) and a coordinated pandemic preparedness mechanism (iii) align with the cluster’s view that Quad convergence is likeliest on technology standards and pandemic preparedness — practical, lower‑risk, high‑value domains that deepen institutional cooperation without forcing binding defense commitments (Bullet Point 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Pairing mutual basing (ii) with pandemic preparedness (iii) mixes an unlikely high‑risk security step with a plausible low‑risk cooperation area. The cluster suggests basing or permanent deployments are not part of the likely incremental trajectory (Bullet Point 1).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Including mutual permanent basing rights (ii) is inconsistent with the cluster’s diagnosis. Permanent basing implies formalized security commitments and would be higher risk; the cluster suggests Quad cooperation will prioritize lower‑risk areas such as standards for emerging technologies rather than permanent basing (Bullet Point 1)."

                "0": "Incorrect. The cluster does not claim non‑military cooperation is irrelevant; rather, it suggests such cooperation is where the Quad can deliver meaningful institutional deepening. Non‑military initiatives can influence regional stability and norms even if they do not equal military deterrence (Bullet Point 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Immediate deterrence through unified military commitments requires coherent, shared threat perceptions and formalized defense arrangements, which the cluster identifies as unlikely. The Quad’s current trajectory is incremental and pragmatic, not an instant military deterrent (Bullet Point 1).",
                "2": "Correct. This option aligns with the cluster’s conclusion that the Quad is a significant but imperfect instrument: it can advance resilience in supply chains, health security, and tech standards (low‑risk, high‑value areas) while not serving as a direct substitute for formal alliances or established multilateral institutions. This preserves India’s strategic autonomy and reflects the Quad’s limitations (Bullet Points 1 and 2).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Transforming into an economic union that replaces ASEAN is implausible and inconsistent with the cluster’s description. The Quad lacks the broad membership and institutional mandate of ASEAN; the cluster portrays it as a focused, flexible platform rather than a regional institutional replacement (Bullet Point 2)."
