                "1": "Incorrect. School feeding supports attendance and learning (bullets 4 and 6) and is valuable for older children, but it does not protect infants in the critical early development window. Therefore, while complementary, it is suboptimal as the immediate priority to prevent long‑term stunting and cognitive loss.",

Vocational training may increase later workforce readiness (bullet 0 and 4), but it does not prevent early childhood malnutrition or its irreversible effects on cognition and school attainment (bullet 3).

Targeted nutrition interventions—therapeutic and supplementary feeding for pregnant women and young children—directly interrupt the causal chain food shortages → hunger → malnutrition → poor health → reduced cognitive development (bullets 3 and 6).

It would weaken the institutional coordination and public‑system legitimacy emphasized in bullet 14 and the integrated approach in bullet 16. A mixed, transparent procurement model with safeguards is preferable.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While reduced dietary diversity can be a concern, the proposed safeguard (imposing strict national menus with 'exotic' items) is unrealistic and counterproductive—it would ignore regional diets and procurement capacity. Bullet 15 emphasizes adapting menus to regional diets rather than imposing uniform stipulations.",
                "2": "Correct. Procuring heavily from local suppliers can stimulate rural incomes but also risks creating price spikes or crowding out other buyers if not managed—this is precisely the kind of market disruption that bullet 15 warns against. A phased procurement approach, price‑stability clauses and diversified sourcing help balance benefits to local producers without destabilising local markets, aligning with the need for market safeguards and rigorous M&E.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Centralised procurement that seeks the cheapest suppliers can exclude smallholders and local producers, worsening the problem of benefiting local economies. The risk described (decline in farmer incomes) is mischaracterised relative to the stated procurement plan; the better safeguard is ensuring procurement practices that intentionally include small producers, not centralisation as suggested, which could conflict with bullets 14 and 15."

The programme’s value lies in its multi‑sectoral returns, not solely in producer support (bullets 15 and 16).",

Although fiscal sustainability is an important consideration (bullet 14), dismissing school feeding as an inappropriate security tool overlooks its high leverage: modest recurring costs can yield large gains in human capital and stability. Properly embedded in fiscal and institutional frameworks, it can be sustainable and strategically valuable (bullets 14 and 16).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Treating school feeding as only a welfare transfer misses its multifunctional nature. Bullet 16 emphasizes that school feeding links human development, local economic stimulation and state legitimacy—roles that extend beyond short‑term welfare.",

This option captures the synthesis from bullet 16: school feeding is more than a transfer—it's a strategic, relatively low‑cost instrument that advances education (attendance, learning), gender parity (girls’ enrolment), health (nutrition, deworming, WASH), and local stability via procurement and economic stimulation. Those combined effects can strengthen state legitimacy and societal resilience, making it relevant to national‑security planning."

While district‑level innovation is valuable, absence of formal state or national coordination risks fragmented delivery, inconsistent financing, weak accountability and missed opportunities for integrated services that enhance state legitimacy and resilience (bullet 16).
