The DN membership documentation explicitly identifies domestic lead agencies for each member (bullet points 0 and 2) and highlights that lead agencies vary widely across states (bullet point 4). Therefore the pragmatic first step is to consult DN’s published list to see which agency plays that role in comparable members and then identify the equivalent domestic body, recognising that responsibilities may be held by finance, interior, presidency offices, culture/media/tech departments, or specialised agencies.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Although some members coordinate DN activity from the President’s/Prime Minister’s Office (bullet point 2 lists some presidency offices), this is not universal (bullet point 4). Treating the executive office as the default contact overlooks the documented diversity of lead-agency arrangements and may bypass the technical body responsible for digital-government work.",
                "2": "Incorrect. DN is a voluntary peer-learning coalition, not a diplomatic treaty mechanism (bullet point 3). While embassies can facilitate introductions, the membership list is intended to clarify practical technical contact points (bullet point 6), so contacting an embassy first is unnecessarily indirect and risks missing the correct technical lead.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While DN focuses on digital-government themes, the evidence shows there is no single institutional home across members (bullet point 4). Not all members use a dedicated digital ministry—examples include ministries of finance, interior, and presidency offices—so assuming a dedicated digital ministry will exist risks misidentifying the correct contact."

The numeric labels (Digital 5/7/9) do offer reputational signalling (Bullet 2), but the DN’s substantive value comes from active policy experimentation, benchmarking and shared toolkits (Bullets 1, 4, 5).

Effective comparative projects therefore need flexible stakeholder mappings and explicit coordination mechanisms to ensure relevant ministries and offices are engaged—consistent with DN’s peer-learning remit across technical themes (bullet point 3) and the signalling role of identifying lead agencies (bullet point 6).",

Moderate, calibrated market openness preserves incentives for investment while protecting critical data and strategic industries (bullet 3). This allocation therefore balances short-term security with long-term industrial depth and human capital formation (bullet 0).",
