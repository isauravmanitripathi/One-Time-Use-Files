Benelux did not create a supranational order that could unilaterally override national law in the manner of later EU competences; rather it combined intergovernmental coordination with judicial cooperation where appropriate (e.g., Benelux Court).

The Benelux experiment combined a practical customs union (a concrete policy deliverable) with intergovernmental organs and cooperative mechanisms that respected national sovereignty while achieving integration.

The Benelux cluster suggests that federal accommodation—especially asymmetric devolution tailored to cultural-linguistic groups—can mitigate conflict while preserving national-level coordination, a lesson applicable for India.",

Temporary or ad‑hoc special statuses can be useful short‑term measures but are unlikely to provide the durable, structured accommodation necessary for persistent cleavages.
