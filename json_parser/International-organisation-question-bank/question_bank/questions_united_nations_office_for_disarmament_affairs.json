This captures UNODA’s dual role: synthesizing legal/technical expertise for treaties and standards (bullet 1), servicing negotiations and fora (bullet 2), and providing practical preventive and post‑conflict programmes (bullet 0). Those combined activities create normative expectations and practical measures that influence national doctrine, procurement and export control choices (bullet 3).",

The Article 7 database aggregates national reports containing data on stockpiles, clearance and victim assistance, enabling identification of reporting gaps and facilitating comparative assessments of national practice.
