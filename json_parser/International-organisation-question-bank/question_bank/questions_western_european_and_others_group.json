This answer captures the nuanced institutional and diplomatic implications presented in the cluster: the rotation is an informal convention that aims for equitable distribution (bullet 1) and shapes candidacy planning, coalition‑building and bargaining (bullet 0). The flexibility aids diplomatic negotiation but also allows informal deal‑making and can introduce unpredictability compared with a codified statute. The composition of WEOG (bullet 6) and the variety of past presidents (bullet 3) illustrate both inclusion and the need for bargaining.",

Based on the cluster’s analysis, which strategic calculus and immediate lobbying tactic would most likely have increased its chance of gaining de facto access before formal admission?",

                "Adopt a wait-and-see approach, avoiding any engagement with WEOG until formal de jure admission is guaranteed, to preserve neutrality and avoid domestic criticism.",
                "Assess potential political benefits (e.g., access to electoral caucuses) against costs (identity, diplomatic commitments), then seek observer attendance at WEOG meetings and cultivate key sponsors (e.g., Australia, Canada, US) to normalize participation incrementally.",
                "Offer explicit policy concessions (e.g., voting alignment on specific issues) in exchange for guaranteed votes for de jure membership, formalizing the deal through written bilateral agreements."

                "0": "Incorrect. Forcing immediate de jure membership via extraordinary GA action was unlikely and contrary to historical patterns described in Bullet Point 21; de facto incremental access typically preceded formal admission.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Avoiding engagement would forfeit opportunities to build relationships and gain de facto access. Bullet Point 23 recommends outreach and incremental entry strategies rather than passivity.",
                "2": "Correct. This reflects Bullet Point 22’s question about how small states calculated costs/benefits and used lobbying strategies, and Bullet Point 21’s evidence that de facto seat access often came via observer attendance and negotiation trajectories with states like Australia, Canada and the US. Incremental, sponsor-based normalization is the historically plausible path.",

This synthesizes Bullet Point 24’s concluding synthesis that procedural language, coalition politics and normative persuasion intersect, and Bullet Point 22’s reference to South Africa’s exclusion showing norms can change membership outcomes—but often via procedural routes and coalition management (Bullet Points 21–24).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While great-power influence matters, the cluster argues that layered diplomacy—including small-state outreach, procedural texts, and normative persuasion—shapes access; it does not reduce outcomes to unilateral great-power decisions (see Bullet Points 23 and 24).",
