While national accreditation can secure portability (see Bullet 0 / Index 7 and Bullet 1 / Index 8), it is not the only route; joint-degree partnerships have also achieved recognised accreditation and can combine portability with domestic control (e.g., UNU-MERIT's recognitions noted in Bullet 3 / Index 10).",
