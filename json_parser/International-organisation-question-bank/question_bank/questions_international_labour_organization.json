The Governing Body is the executive council that sets programme and budgetary directions between Conferences (bullet 5), but it does not replace the ILC’s supreme policy‑making role in adopting Conventions.

This option recognises both facts: governments have proportionally greater representation at the ILC (bullet 4), but the ILO’s distinct legitimacy and functional strength derive from tripartism—bringing governments, employers and workers together on an equal institutional footing in policy processes (bullet 3). As a result, contentious proposals usually require negotiation and accommodation to secure effective support and subsequent implementation (bullets 3 and 5).",

There is no indication that political attendance causes the Governing Body to refuse supervisory responsibilities; rather, the Governing Body is mandated to manage and supervise implementation (Index 10). The presence of political leaders tends to increase visibility rather than prompt delegation to external bodies (Index 11).",
                "1": "Incorrect. This option incorrectly suggests that high‑level attendance overrides the tripartite structure and removes the Governing Body’s role. In reality, the Governing Body performs concrete managerial and supervisory functions between Conferences (Index 10), and high‑level attendance complements rather than replaces institutional roles (Index 8).",
                "2": "Correct. The ILC elects the Governing Body which acts as the executive council managing the ILO between Conferences, determining agendas and supervising implementation (Index 10). Occasional attendance by heads of state and prime ministers highlights the ILC’s political resonance (Index 8), which can amplify national attention to Conference outcomes and facilitate implementation when political leaders engage.",

While some high‑level attendance may be symbolic, the evidence points to substantive political resonance (Index 8) and an active Governing Body elected by the ILC that supervises implementation (Index 10). Conference decisions therefore benefit from both technical follow‑up and potential political support."

However, standardized, comparable indicators can mask local heterogeneity and context-specific drivers of vulnerability (e.g., local labour institutions, migration patterns, community-level grievances). Therefore, policymakers should complement ILO indicators with local data and qualitative insights when addressing security risks.",

Restricting participation to government officials reduces multi‑stakeholder engagement (trade unions, employers, civil society) that is central for comprehensive labour governance (bullet 8) and weakens regional inclusivity and long‑term impact (bullets 12, 10).",
                "1": "Incorrect. One‑off seminars and limited stakeholder invitation produce limited systemic change. Translating materials is useful (bullet 7) but insufficient without sustained programmes, scholarships, multi‑stakeholder participation and technical cooperation projects that create durable institutional change (bullets 9, 10, 12).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While the LL.M. (bullet 12) is valuable for legal and policy officers, using it as the sole instrument ignores operational training, broader stakeholder engagement, and regional activities (bullets 9, 8). Academic accreditation alone cannot deliver the practical, multi‑actor capacity and regional leadership outcomes needed for security and development objectives (bullets 11, 13).",

It synthesizes India‑specific cooperation opportunities and strategic aims described in the cluster (bullets 12, 11, and 9) — delivering both normative policy transfer and on‑the‑ground capability enhancement while projecting regional influence."

Strengthening monitoring and assistance directly targets implementation gaps.",

Testimony can be sidelined if the CSO lacks connections to delegations or broader political weight (see Bullet Point 1 and constraints in Bullet Point 2).",

Coalition‑building and advocacy are identified as a principal mechanism through which CSOs turn evidence into influence: by forming alliances across countries and linking international advocacy with domestic mobilization they alter bargaining dynamics at the ILC and in preparatory processes (Bullet Point 1). This strategy helps overcome access asymmetries and visibility gaps (Bullet Point 2) by amplifying evidence and creating political pressure that delegations must reckon with.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Knowledge production is valuable (Bullet Point 1) and technical reports become de facto evidence, but producing long manuals without strategic coalition or advocacy risks limited uptake due to access barriers and agenda fragmentation (Bullet Point 2). Documentation must be paired with advocacy channels to influence outcomes effectively.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Partnering with better‑resourced NGOs can increase visibility, but it reproduces resource asymmetries and raises representativeness questions (Bullet Point 2). Reliance on intermediaries may dilute the grassroots organisation’s perspectives and reduce the accountability of claims (Bullet Point 3 recommends capacity support and transparent channels instead)."

Testing is still required to identify people living with HIV and link them to ART; moreover, U=U messages require viral suppression via treatment, which presumes diagnosis and linkage to care—so complacency is not a plausible widespread cause of low uptake (Bullets 10, 8).",

The cluster highlights persistent stigma and discrimination in many workplaces, uneven social protection coverage, and difficulties linking workplace programmes to reliable treatment and continuity of care—especially in low‑resource settings (Bullets 10, 8, 12). VCT@WORK’s effectiveness hinges on employer commitment to non‑discrimination, confidentiality, legal protections, and reliable linkage to ART—if these are weak, uptake will remain low (Bullet 8).",

While union dynamics can influence programmes, the cluster does not indicate that trade union engagement typically reduces uptake; on the contrary, active involvement of employers and unions is seen as supportive of policy design and implementation (Bullet 9).
