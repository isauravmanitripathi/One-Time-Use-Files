Enlargement and departures were shaped by geopolitics (Finland’s associate status due to Cold War constraints), domestic political processes (Norway’s referendums rejecting EEC/EU membership in 1972 and 1994), and the pull of deeper integration in the EEC/EU leading some members to leave EFTA for the EU (bullets 5, 6, 7).",

By contrast, a non‑accession successor agreement (e.g., Turkey 1995–2021) results from negotiation and will reflect the specific scope the parties choose to cover; it can be modern and wide‑ranging but remains as a treaty between states rather than a handover to a supranational policy (bullet points 4 and 5).",

This option reflects the explicit research avenues in Bullet Point 5 (Index 11): primary sources (EFTA archives, Portuguese budgetary and development records, legal instruments, accession documents) plus secondary literature on Portugal’s recovery and EFTA’s role provide a comprehensive basis for rigorous historical and policy analysis."
