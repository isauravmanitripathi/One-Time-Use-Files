The West Nordic Council is an inter‑parliamentary cooperative forum intended to coordinate parliamentary engagement and influence policy, not to exercise supranational binding legal authority over states.

Multilingualism is an explicit feature of the Council (local‑language variants in Greenlandic, Faroese, Icelandic and Danish) and is presented as reinforcing a shared regional outlook rather than impeding cooperation. Therefore, language differences are not a strong argument in favor of relying on pan‑Nordic institutions (Bullet Point 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While fragmentation is a possible risk, the historical justification for the West Nordic Council was the opposite concern — that pan‑Nordic bodies were not adequately addressing particular West Nordic concerns.

The West Nordic Council was created to give the North‑Atlantic subregion a common parliamentary voice because certain North Atlantic issues — notably fisheries, maritime safety and environmental protection — were not fully addressed through wider Nordic bodies (Bullet Point 2).

The listing (bullet 0) explicitly shows venue rotation across polities, and bullet 2 interprets this as signaling egalitarian hosting—so venue choice likely has symbolic and practical value beyond individual presidencies.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Weak institutionalization would be better evidenced by irregular meeting rhythm or missing years. But bullet 2 highlights a durable annual rhythm (meetings recorded every year from 1985 onward), which suggests institutional continuity despite rotation of venues; rotation itself does not imply weakness.",
                "2": "Correct. Bullet points 0 and 2 record rotation of venues among Greenlandic, Faroese and Icelandic towns and interpret this as signalling an egalitarian hosting norm. Rotating meeting sites across member polities is a common practice to underline parity and shared ownership in small regional assemblies, so inferring an egalitarian norm is well supported by the data.",

Bullet 2 emphasizes rotation among Greenlandic, Faroese and Icelandic towns as an egalitarian norm, not dominance by one polity. Isolated repetitions do not justify concluding dominance without further evidence."

Adding executives could create an intergovernmental body with different capacities, but it would also change the Council’s character from a parliamentary forum (Bullet Point 1).
