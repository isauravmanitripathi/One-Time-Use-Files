The 1335 Congress was motivated by pragmatic economic objectives — creating alternative trade routes to circumvent Vienna’s staple — and demonstrated how coordinated economic policy could serve broader political ends (bullets 1 and 0). The modern Visegrád Group intentionally evokes this precedent to justify and shape cooperative economic and political strategies rather than to revive medieval institutions wholesale.",

Prague does have the highest GDP (PPP) per capita (bullet 6), which supports co‑financing and strong utilisation, yet the decision criterion here emphasises aggregate congestion reduction and metropolitan scale — Prague’s metro (≈2.65 million) is smaller than Budapest’s (bullet 2), so aggregate commuter impact would likely be less.",
