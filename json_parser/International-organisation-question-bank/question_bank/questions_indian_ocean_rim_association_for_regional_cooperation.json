This option reflects IORA’s development‑oriented regionalism (bullet 0) and its operational model which favours projects with multi‑stakeholder participation and a coordinating Secretariat (bullet 1). Incorporating green port tech and trade facilitation links to IORA priority areas (trade facilitation, maritime transport, and Blue Economy—bullets 4 and 5) while targeted skills and entrepreneurship for women aligns with the cross‑cutting Women’s Economic Empowerment focus (bullet 5). Aligning with SDGs and donor priorities helps resource mobilisation and legitimacy (bullet 2). The approach also respects IORA’s objective to promote sustainable growth, shared benefits and liberalisation through capacity building (bullet 3 and 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. A defence‑led, security‑first framing neglects IORA’s development and multi‑stakeholder project orientation (bullet 1) and the explicit priority areas focusing on trade, ports, tourism and Blue Economy (bullet 4 and 6). While maritime security is a priority, IORA favours cooperative, civilian‑led measures in development contexts rather than primarily militarised infrastructure delivery.",

While attracting FDI is part of IORA’s project typology (bullet 6), offering relaxed environmental and labour standards undermines IORA’s emphasis on sustainable, balanced development and environmental governance under the Blue Economy (bullets 0 and 5).

Rapidly pushing for enforcement‑level mandates and a standing force is likely impractical given institutional constraints, sovereignty concerns, and the consensus challenges of an expanded membership (bullet 8 and 9).

Delegating leadership to multilateral donors may reduce India’s normative influence in the region and forego opportunities to leverage Indian institutions for sustained mentorship (Bullet 9 and 10).

This option integrates Bullets 9, 10 and 11: ISDP is described as a low‑risk, high‑value mechanism that should consolidate partnerships and build resilience; practical steps include funded pilots, Indian technical capacity for mentorship, and modular toolkits to translate goodwill into institutional change while reducing non‑traditional security pressures.",
