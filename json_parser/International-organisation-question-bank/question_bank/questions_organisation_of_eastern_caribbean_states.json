The coexistence of OECS, CARICOM and the CSME illustrates a layered approach to regional governance: OECS focuses on intensive, tailored integration among Eastern Caribbean states (shared courts, financial governance, sectoral agencies), CARICOM provides a wider framework, and the CSME represents deeper economic union among select members. This layered model allows small‑island states to pursue integration instruments matched to their scale and specific constraints (see bullet points 5 and 6).",

While some duplication can occur, the OECS was formed purposefully to provide deeper, more immediate solutions to small‑island structural problems (pooled public goods, harmonised regulation) that a broader organisation may not prioritise.

                "1": "Incorrect. The cluster attributes clear symbolic significance to the date and venue (bullet 2); treating them as irrelevant ignores how such acts function as deliberate signals of maturity and identity.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Though the unveiling had internal cohesion aspects (bullet 3), bullets 2 and 7 emphasise that the emblem also serves external signalling functions and broader branding in international fora.",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet 2 explains that the adoption and first raising on 21 June 2006 was a deliberate institutional act of self‑presentation and branding, and that choosing Basseterre functioned as a host‑state signal embedding the unveiling in the organisation's territorial and political geography."

This option synthesises the practical analytic lessons and semiotic programme in the OECS example: bullet 5 endorses numerically explicit design elements for membership parity; bullet 1 explains the alternation of orange (dynamism) and white (peace) balancing activism and legitimacy; and bullets 3 and 7 emphasise concentric, numerically coded composition for unity, outreach and recognisability.",
