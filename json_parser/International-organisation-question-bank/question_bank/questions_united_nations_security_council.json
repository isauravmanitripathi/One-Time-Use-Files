The inclusion of the veto was primarily a practical and political compromise to ensure that great powers would remain engaged in the system and be willing to carry out enforcement measures. This reflects lessons from the interwar period when major‑power absence or disengagement undermined collective security (bullet points 6 and 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although colonised and newly independent peoples were wary of great‑power privilege—and this wariness influenced postwar attitudes—the veto was not designed to preserve colonial hierarchies. On the contrary, it was an attempt to ensure enforcement by powerful states, even if it institutionalised privilege in practice (bullet points 5, 6 and 0).",

This option accurately synthesizes the different modes: Korea’s Council authorization depended on the Soviet absence (removing a veto) enabling a US-led coalition (bullet 2); Suez produced UNEF as a consent-based peacekeeping innovation when enforcement was politically unavailable (bullet 3); Congo (ONUC) saw Hammarskjöld’s Secretariat take operational initiative, using peacekeeping and coercive measures to restore central authority (bullet 4).",

This misstates the record: Korea involved Security Council authorization of force because the Soviet veto was absent (a procedural contingency), not Secretariat-initiated peacekeeping.

Binding character does not depend on a simple majority of Council members; decisions on substantive matters in the Security Council require affirmative votes including the concurrence (i.e., no veto) of all P5 members for them to be adopted as Council decisions.

This option is consistent with the cluster observation about India: given India’s long‑standing emphasis on multilateral institutions and a rules‑based order, the pragmatic route is to engage within Security Council subsidiary bodies that operationalize sanctions and counter‑terrorism obligations.

ENEL (which established the primacy of EU law over conflicting national law) as an analogue for how pooled sovereignty can function, and the NWF argues regional entities could be eligible without formal Charter amendment through flexible interpretation by the General Assembly and Security Council — but such models face formidable legal and political challenges given the Charter’s conception of membership and voting rights in terms of states.",

                "1": "Correct. This option synthesizes key insights: semi‑permanent seats expand representational continuity without adding veto holders (bullet 7) but fall short of permanent status and prestige, meaning aspirants will likely continue to seek fuller reforms. Regional rivalries and the centrality of P5 politics remain significant obstacles (bullets 12 and 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Semi‑permanent seats improve continuity but do not equate to permanent membership with veto power and associated prestige; the cluster notes aspirant states (like India) value permanence and may not be satisfied by semi‑permanent arrangements (bullet 13). Regional rivalries are therefore unlikely to dissipate solely because of such a change (bullet 12).",

Semi‑permanent seats do not eliminate the relevance of regional coalitions; in fact, regional rivalries and competing claims often shape who benefits from new seat categories (bullet 12).
