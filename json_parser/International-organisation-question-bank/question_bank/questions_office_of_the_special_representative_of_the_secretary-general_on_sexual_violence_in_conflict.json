While reparative and psychosocial services are essential (bullet 3 notes victim‑responsive measures as part of a holistic response), deferring accountability risks perpetuating impunity and undermines survivors’ trust in justice. The TOE’s approach is to link reparative measures with accountability rather than postpone prosecutions.",

Bullet points 0 and 3 explain that the TOE is mandated to link international norms to national capacity‑building, and its first operational priority is collaborating with national civilian and military legal and judicial officials to address impunity and strengthen capacity to investigate and prosecute conflict‑related sexual violence. Strengthening national investigations and prosecutions directly targets the legal gaps enabling impunity while enabling concurrent survivor‑centred measures.",

On the contrary, it required system‑wide monitoring and reporting to prompt accountability (bullet points 2 and 3).",

Immediate international referral can be appropriate in some contexts (bullet 10), but an uncompromising push for coercive multilateral action risks conflicting with India’s emphasis on sovereignty and phased engagement (bullet 11) and may foreclose cooperative solutions that build lasting domestic capacity (bullets 13, 14).",

Unilateral military or law‑enforcement action by Indian contingents inside another sovereign state would violate UN and international norms and India’s stated preference for respecting sovereignty and using cooperative measures (bullets 11, 12). Peacekeepers should operate under UN mandate and doctrine (bullet 12).",

This option synthesises the use of SRSG monitoring/mapping and targeted measures where evidence is strong (bullet 10) with India’s preference for capacity‑building, state ownership and survivor‑centred assistance (bullets 11, 14).
