By the time of the Tokyo Round (bullet 4), negotiators confronted non‑tariff barriers and sector‑specific regulatory issues, prompting new instruments to clarify how existing GATT rules applied to emerging practices (bullet 0). Thus the substantive reason for the shift was the changing nature of residual trade barriers after tariff liberalization.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The shift was not primarily driven by a rise in bilateral trade requiring bilateral solutions. The Tokyo Round produced multilateral and plurilateral instruments to address sectoral problems (bullet 4 and bullet 5), showing the response remained multilateral in character where possible (bullet 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While sovereignty concerns always matter, the premise that tariffs could not be negotiated multilaterally is wrong—tariffs were the main subject of successful early multilateral rounds (bullet 1). The move to NTMs reflected the nature of remaining barriers, not principally a concession that tariffs were untouchable.",
                "3": "Incorrect. This option implies cynical motives only and treats NTMs as mere protectionist camouflage. Although NTMs could be used protectionistically, the Tokyo Round produced instruments (bullet 4) to discipline such measures (bullet 0), indicating the shift was a policy response to real regulatory barriers rather than solely a cover for protectionism."

However, reliance on an Article XX paragraph is not sufficient by itself; the measure must also pass the chapeau test — i.e., it must not constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade. The Dispute Settlement Mechanism (DSM) adjudicates such claims (bullet 3), and panels examine both whether the measure fits a listed exception and whether it is being applied consistently with the chapeau (bullet 5 and 6).",

Avoiding regional agreements and dispute mechanisms overlooks the WTR’s finding that both forums can provide benefits, including capacity building and dispute remedies (indices 8 and 9).

While RTAs can provide immediate market access (index 8), the WTR warns about the limits of relying solely on regionalism: it can fragment rules and leave smaller players exposed if they disengage from multilateral norm‑formation (index 9). Exclusive focus on RTAs risks missing out on shaping global rules and mobilizing broader coalitions.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The dispute‑settlement system is valuable but not a standalone solution (index 8). The WTR underlines that institutions may need adaptation and that strategic engagement—negotiations, coalitions, and domestic policy—matters alongside litigation (index 9 and 12).",

The WTR tracks the coexistence of multilateral and regional approaches and emphasizes that states should diagnose where cooperation is fraying and where coalitions are forming (index 8 and 9).

The Forum imposes limits on political lobbying and stresses institutional neutrality; stating an intention to lobby aggressively is likely to conflict with the code of conduct and participation rules and could lead to refusal or restrictions (source bullet 3).

The Secretariat commonly denies or delays accreditation for insufficient documentation, unclear governance, lack of demonstrated relevance or absence of verifiable outputs (see source bullet 4).

Market‑access commitments and legal adjustments often depend on the applicant’s specific tariff structures, services sectors, and domestic regulations; they are not readily standardizable.

The consensus rule governs approval of accession, but it does not on its face prohibit standardization; the principal barrier is practical and political (members’ desire for tailored concessions), not a formal legal prohibition.
