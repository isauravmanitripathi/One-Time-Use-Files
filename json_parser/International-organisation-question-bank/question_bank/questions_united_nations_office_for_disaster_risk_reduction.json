Advising on linking relief to 'Build Back Better' also reflects the Sendai Framework priority on enhancing preparedness and recovery (bullet point 5). Facilitating links to operational humanitarian agencies is consistent with UNDRR's coordination and advocacy role.",

Bullet point 3 and the mention of field presences in bullet point 4 indicate UNDRR does have regional and field engagement to support states. Declining involvement would undermine its convening and capacity-building remit described in bullet point 1.",

However, it was more normative guidance than the decisive policy instrument that directly justified statutory national institutions like India’s DM Act.",
                "2": "Correct. The Hyogo Framework for Action (bullet 6) explicitly framed DRR as a precondition for development success and called for national policy, institutional capacity, risk assessment and early warning systems—providing the specific normative logic that countries used to justify domestic laws and national authorities (as reflected in India’s 2005 Act and NDMA).",

UNDRR's role as custodian of the Sendai monitoring framework (bullet point 6) makes support for reporting systems a natural comparative advantage.",

Starting with WSSD‑style policy linkages (bullet 5) is important, but without earlier coordination mechanisms and technical base the linkage to implementation will be weak.

The historical evolution (bullets 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) shows an incremental pathway: IDNDR established technical foundations; Yokohama introduced prevention, community involvement and mainstreaming; ISDR/UNISDR created a coordination mechanism; and later instruments (WSSD, HFA) linked DRR explicitly with sustainable development and national policy—suggesting that combining technical work, community engagement, coordination and then mainstreaming into development policy is the pragmatic sequence for low‑capacity states."

                "2": "Incorrect. No program, including ARISE, can immediately eliminate all disaster risks. The bullet realistically frames ARISE as a pathway to materially strengthen capacity when adapted—an incremental, pragmatic improvement rather than a panacea.",
                "3": "Correct. This option aligns with the bullet’s message: ARISE channels private resources and expertise into DRR in a pragmatic and results‑oriented way; when adapted to local institutions, it can materially strengthen capacity, reduce vulnerability, and serve development and national security aims."

                "0": "Incorrect. The bullet does not suggest technological incompatibility as the main barrier. Rather, it points to institutional adaptation. Technologies can usually be integrated if institutions and incentives are aligned.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The bullet explicitly connects disaster resilience with national security and developmental imperatives in India, making option 4 inaccurate and contrary to the stated context.",
                "2": "Correct. The bullet stresses that ARISE’s tools, if adapted to local institutional realities, can materially strengthen India’s capacity. Therefore, a key challenge is the potential misalignment between private incentives and local institutions—addressable by policy, regulatory and institutional adaptations.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While capital allocation is always a consideration, the bullet specifically highlights the need to adapt ARISE tools to local institutional realities rather than a global shortage of private capital. There is significant private capital globally; the issue is channeling it effectively into DRR."
