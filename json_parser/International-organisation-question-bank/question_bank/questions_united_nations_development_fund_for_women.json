This response captures the dual nature described in the material: as a voluntary fund UNIFEM had programming flexibility to support innovative, pilot activities (bullets 0, 3, 4), but reliance on voluntary contributions also meant funding was less predictable and could limit the ability to scale pilots without deliberate strategies to build evidence and influence national policy (bullets 0, 3).",
