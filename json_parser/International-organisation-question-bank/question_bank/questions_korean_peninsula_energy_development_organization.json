Interim energy assistance alone was not intended to be a permanent replacement for the LWRs; the Framework linked disabling plutonium facilities to reactor construction.

The Agreed Framework was an explicit reciprocal deal: freeze and disable plutonium‑capable facilities (notably at Yongbyon) in return for LWR‑produced civilian energy and interim fuel supplies.
