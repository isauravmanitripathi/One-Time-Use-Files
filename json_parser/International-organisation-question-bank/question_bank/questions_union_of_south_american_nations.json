A formal coordination framework (e.g., MOUs, joint workplans) is the best way to build on complementarities while managing overlaps in surveillance, procurement, and funding (bullet 4). It clarifies comparative advantages and funding streams (bullet 4 and 5), enables shared systems (surveillance, pooled procurement) and specifies how SHC’s networks and ISAGS interact with PAHO/WHO and other regional mechanisms (bullets 0, 3, and 4).

The fragment stresses that many actions were driven by domestic politics rather than formal treaty amendment, and suspension is not identical to formal withdrawal (Index 8); legal status should be checked against official depositary and UN notifications (Index 12).",
                "2": "Correct. The dossier highlights the legal distinction between political suspension and formal withdrawal—suspension commonly reflects political disagreement and has different legal consequences from treaty withdrawal (Index 8). Analysts are advised to consult ratification records and depositary communications as well as UN treaty‑status notifications to verify formal status (Index 12 and Index 10).",
