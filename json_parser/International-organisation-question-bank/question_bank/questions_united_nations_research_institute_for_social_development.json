Integrating SSE with local social protection and municipal legal recognition aligns with UNRISD’s programme emphasis on socially inclusive sustainable development (Index 2) and the tripartite framing linking social policy to stability (Index 1). Preferential public procurement and capacity-building make SSE scalable without relying on volatile capital or provoking elite capture.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Privatization and CSR-led absorption tend to subordinate social objectives to corporate priorities and may neither provide stable livelihoods nor address exclusion. UNRISD’s social policy and sustainable development programmes (Index 2 and Index 5) emphasize public-policy supports and community forms rather than substitution of public responsibility by private actors.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Heavy central standardization can undermine the locally embedded, democratic governance of SSE organizations. UNRISD evidence (Index 5) stresses context-sensitive, participatory models and knowledge-sharing (SSE Knowledge Hub) rather than rigid top-down control, which can stifle innovation and local ownership.",

Therefore, integrating progressive social policies and conflict-sensitive resource governance addresses structural drivers of instability and complements, rather than replaces, security measures.",

Although military capacity is part of national security, UNRISD’s research (Index 0 and Index 1) emphasizes that tackling social drivers—inequality and governance—is essential for long-term stability. Overreliance on hard-security measures risks neglecting legitimacy deficits that fuel unrest.",

The Politics of Domestic Resource Mobilization project (Index 4) underscores the need for progressive fiscal instruments and carefully designed redistribution to sustain social investment without provoking elite backlash. Combining progressive taxation, local revenue-sharing, regulation of speculative financial practices, and participatory oversight addresses both economic distribution and governance—reducing grievance drivers.",

                "1": "Incorrect. Aligning entirely with donor priorities may secure resources but reduces autonomy and the ability to pursue critical or innovative agendas; this can diminish perceived credibility and limit influence among academic, NGO, and policy communities (contradicts bullet 2).",
                "2": "Correct. The combination of UN institutional placement (which confers legitimacy and direct access to intergovernmental fora and national processes) together with governance independence and mixed funding (which creates autonomy to pursue critical or innovative research) is exactly how a small, research‑focused institute can exert outsized influence (see bullets 0, 1, 2). Institutional placement opens doors; autonomy and diverse funding let the institute pursue non‑consensus agendas that attract attention and credibility.",
