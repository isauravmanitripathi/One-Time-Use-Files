The tribunals were conceived as temporary Chapter VII organs to ensure prompt, binding remedies for mass atrocities while the more time‑consuming project of creating a permanent institution (the ICC) proceeded.

This option synthesizes the distinction that the IRMCT is a residual, transitional body created under UNSC Resolution 1966 (Chapter VII) to complete the ICTY/ICTR’s work, and is not a standing, treaty‑based court like the ICC. Mislabeling could mislead policymakers about permanence, jurisdictional reach and obligations (Bullets 0, 1, 6).",

Legal obligations and expectations toward the IRMCT are shaped by its UN Security Council mandate and the Mechanism’s administrative arrangements, not merely by popular labels or domestic law alone.

Blanket cessation of cooperation with a UN‑mandated residual mechanism is impractical: the IRMCT’s functions (e.g., arrests, witness programs, enforcement) require international assistance and its UN administrative ties mean political reliability is subject to UN processes, not simple unreliability (Bullets 4, 7).",

Bullet 3 explicitly identifies the Office of the Prosecutor as responsible for remaining investigative/prosecutorial tasks including monitoring enforcement and cooperating with national authorities.

Geographic balance across regions is important for representativeness and global legitimacy (Bullet Point 1), and it helps perceptions of fairness, but it does not directly counteract great‑power bargaining in the roster-preparation process; GA election more directly dilutes Security Council dominance.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While Security Council preparation of the roster is part of the mechanism, it is precisely this step that subjects selections to geopolitical bargaining and great‑power dynamics (Bullet Point 1). Hence roster preparation by the Security Council tends to raise, not mitigate, concerns about exclusive influence.",
                "2": "Incorrect. National prosecutorial experience is a valuable qualification (Bullet Point 4) but does not primarily address geopolitical legitimacy or perceptions of great‑power capture. It helps functional competence rather than the specific concern about exclusive influence over selection.",
                "3": "Correct. Election by the UN General Assembly gives a wider multilateral endorsement that mitigates the perception of exclusive great‑power control inherent in Security Council processes. This directly addresses the representativeness/legitimacy tension noted in the roster process and is explicitly identified as a legitimacy-enhancing feature in the cluster (see Bullet Point 1). For a state like India—sensitive to sovereignty and great‑power bargaining—GA endorsement is therefore the most effective single factor for perceived fairness."

Reappointment possibilities and thorough documentation directly address both continuity and scheduling: reappointment allows retention of experienced judges across episodes, while detailed records and handover protocols preserve institutional memory when turnover occurs.
