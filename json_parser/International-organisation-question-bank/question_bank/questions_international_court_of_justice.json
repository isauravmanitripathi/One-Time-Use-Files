This option captures the PCA model: a permanent administrative bureau (registry-like secretariat) providing continuity and support, combined with a list-based, consent-dependent method for constituting tribunals, preserving state control over who adjudicates each dispute (see bullet points 1, 2 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Compulsory jurisdiction removes the need for state consent in each case. The PCA’s design — and the Hague-era compromise more generally — emphasized consent-based adjudication; proposals for compulsory or standing jurisdictions were controversial and deferred at the 1907 conference (see bullets 3, 4 and 5).",

Bullet 1 shows continuity and re‑election norms—experienced, respected jurists are likely to be re‑elected—while bullets 4 and 5 explain that legal‑tradition representation and customary practice favor candidates who embody recognized legal systems (here, common law).

Accumulating short‑term national presence is impractical because the presidency is not routinely filled by deliberate national turn‑taking, and repeated presidencies by a country reflect longstanding prominence of individual jurists rather than orchestrated short terms (bullet 4 and bullet 5).

Although provisional measures are legally binding in principle (bullet 10), the ICJ lacks an enforcement apparatus comparable to the Security Council’s Chapter VII tools.

This follows directly from the source’s conclusion that the ICJ is best treated as a complementary instrument to be deployed selectively alongside diplomatic, political, and, when necessary, coercive measures. Selective use when legal clarity and jurisdictional basis exist maximises the Court’s utility while recognising its limits.",

This captures the core trade‑off discussed in Bullet 1 (index 0) and Bullet 4 (index 3): non‑coercive mechanisms (reporting, review) can be politically palatable and help build normative pressure, but where states face high political stakes or powerful actors resist, such measures may not be enough without stronger enforcement or political solutions.",

Non‑coercive institutional mechanisms are valuable, but Bullet 3 (index 2) and Bullet 4 (index 3) imply states will still rely on political and diplomatic measures when enforcement is uncertain. Reporting mechanisms do not eliminate the need for complementary political strategies.",

Bullets 1 and 4 (indices 0 and 3) note that the most advantaged states have little incentive to cede leverage, so transparency alone is unlikely to overcome entrenched opposition.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Non‑coercive measures like reporting and review are unlikely to secure immediate, unconditional compliance from all states.

While ICJ judgments may be cited in domestic proceedings and can influence national law, they do not automatically create enforceable domestic obligations in every legal system.
