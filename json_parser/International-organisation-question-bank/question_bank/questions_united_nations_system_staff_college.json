Although economies of scale and resources were considerations, the primary rationale was not to centralize personnel management or to subsume agencies’ training units. The evolution emphasized system‑wide coherence, knowledge management and capacity building rather than simply cost‑centred consolidation (Bullets 0–4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although the Turin pilot used an existing agency facility, the project was intended to demonstrate inter‑agency cooperation and to lead to institutionalization, not merely to be a temporary logistical test. The sequence from study to proposal to pilot to formal endorsement shows long‑term intent (Bullets 1–5).",

This option synthesizes the core drivers seen across the cluster: recognition in the 1993 feasibility study that ad hoc agency training was inadequate (Bullet 1 and 2), acceptance of a joint proposal in 1995 providing momentum (Bullet 3), pilot activities using an agency facility in Turin to demonstrate practical cooperation (Bullet 4), and high‑level endorsement that linked the concept to senior leadership (Bullet 5). Together these elements explain why a coherent, system‑wide training institution was needed."
