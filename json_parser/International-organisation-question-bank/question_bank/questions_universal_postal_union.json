By joining the UPU a state accepts the Universal Postal Convention and the technical/operational standards that make international exchange tractable, which creates predictable routing, rates and treatment of mail while not abrogating national sovereignty. This synthesis draws on the UPU's founding and near‑universal membership (Index 0), its core purpose of harmonizing terms for international mail and standards (Index 2), and the fact that membership obligations are mutual and binding rather than sovereignty‑transferring (Index 3).

Routing through an intermediary country’s postal system by using its postal codes may be necessary in some contexts but is exposed to political sensitivities, potential delays, returns, seizure, and changing bilateral relations (Bullets 7 and 10).

                "1": "Incorrect. The DPG (.post) focuses on technical oversight, standards, accreditation and operational governance rather than setting national postal rates or prescribing cloud vendors; domestic monopoly enforcement is outside its remit (Bullet Point 1).",

This option lists responsibilities aligned with the .post group’s remit: technical oversight, standards coordination, accreditation, and operational governance, including cybersecurity and participation in trust frameworks—precisely the accreditation-relevant items national operators must document (Bullet Point 1; also linked to Bullet Points 4 and 5 for security and standards).",
