Bullet Point 2 also emphasizes consulting treaty and governance texts for formal procedural rights rather than assuming that practice will quickly resolve ambiguity.",

Although the EU is represented in the Council by the Commissioner and the Presidency (bullet 2), the Energy Community is a distinct legal framework for Contracting Parties.

The Council’s role is strategic and procedural (adoption of instruments and policy), not operational management of day-to-day national regulator functions (bullet 0, bullet 3).

This answer recognises both the internal legal functioning (i.e. Community organs acting to prolong the arrangement) and the political/legitimacy questions such unilateral institutional action can raise vis‑à‑vis contracting parties and the evolving EU relationship.",

While treaty amendments often require explicit amendment procedures, the Energy Community’s institutional practice (see bullet 4 and 5) shows that the Ministerial Council exercised its competence to extend duration.

This directly reflects the strategic rationale in Bullet 3: India’s strategic culture emphasizes internal cohesion and autonomy, so managing social and environmental dimensions of energy policy strengthens resilience against internal unrest and external vulnerabilities. It also complements Bullet 4’s call for aligned law and institutions."

                "1": "Incorrect. Creating an ETA is primarily an institutional/governance reform; it does not inherently shift financial responsibility to the state nor replace the need to remove barriers and mobilise private capital as described in Bullet 2.",

This option echoes Bullet 4’s concluding normative lesson: embedding statutory clarity, robust appraisal mechanisms and genuine stakeholder inclusion aligns law, institutions and political instruments to achieve efficient, equitable and environmentally prudent transitions.

                "Immediate reduction in carbon intensity since infrastructure upgrades directly eliminate the need for fossil fuels.",

                "0": "Incorrect. Infrastructure upgrades help reduce system constraints but do not, by themselves, immediately cut carbon intensity if subsidies and preferential treatment keep fossil generators economically advantaged (see Bullet 2). Social opposition can also delay the deployment of low‑carbon assets.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While technical and regulatory improvements attract capital (Bullet 2), remaining distortions such as subsidies and lack of stakeholder inclusion can deter or misdirect private investment; therefore mobilisation is not guaranteed.",
                "2": "Correct. This aligns with Bullets 1, 3 and 4: failing to institutionalise participation and remove distortions risks social friction and legitimacy problems. The Energy Community experience shows transitions that ignore social/political factors encounter protests, delays and increased political risk.",
                "3": "Incorrect. This is overly optimistic and neglects the social and political dimensions highlighted in Bullets 1 and 3. Technical fixes alone often leave social grievances unaddressed, leading to resistance."
