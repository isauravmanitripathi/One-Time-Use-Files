This option reflects the chapter’s argument: failing sustained commitment and resources undermines operator capabilities, organisational learning and data-driven improvement, which increases accident risk and affects public safety, energy security and strategic credibility (Bullet point 3 and Bullet point 4). It also means India misses the benefits of operator-led peer-learning models that strengthen technical, managerial and cultural capabilities (Bullet point 4 and Bullet point 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While stronger regulatory involvement might occur if operators disengage, centralising operational responsibilities is neither practical nor desirable; it could blur roles and reduce operator ownership of safety culture. Bullet point 2 emphasises that WANO’s role is complementary and that regulators retain legal authority, but it does not support the idea that state takeover improves safety or strategy.",
                "3": "Incorrect. This underestimates the value of WANO engagement. WANO offers benchmarking, peer review expertise and confidential learning networks that national programmes alone may struggle to replicate (Bullet point 5). The chapter recommends active participation and investment rather than assuming national efforts suffice."

                "0": "Incorrect. The bullet highlights substantive technical benefits (learning, safety culture) beyond mere symbolism; framing engagement as mainly symbolic understates those concrete advantages.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While concerns about exposure of operational details may exist, the bullet argues the opposite—that engagement strengthens resilience and legitimacy without ceding operational autonomy; it presents engagement as beneficial rather than inevitably erosive.",
                "2": "Correct. This option synthesizes the dual technical and political calculation expressed in the bullet—substantive engagement accelerates safety performance and culture, strengthens legitimacy, enables mutual learning to reduce global accident risk, and does so without ceding operational autonomy.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The bullet contends that international collective improvements via WANO do lower accident probability and consequences and that participation is a pragmatic pathway—thus engagement offers distinct advantages over purely domestic initiatives."
