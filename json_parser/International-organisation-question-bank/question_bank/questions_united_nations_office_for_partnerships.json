                "1": "Incorrect. Allowing a donor to pick a single agency and informing the Advisory Board afterwards would risk misalignment with UN priorities and bypass the required oversight.

UNDEF deliberately uses small‑to‑medium grants because catalytic, context‑specific interventions by local CSOs can be more effective for participation, social inclusion and rights protection than large, generic programs (bullets 1 and 3).",

While national campaigns may reach more people numerically, UNDEF’s premise is that durable peace and democratic consolidation depend on active, independent civil society and local ownership; broad coverage does not guarantee inclusion, protection of rights, or empowerment of marginalized groups (bullet 0 and 1).",

Also, careful design reduces domestic controversy; therefore a blanket expectation of no effect coupled with high controversy is not the most probable combination.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Small, targeted grants are not designed to cause regime change; predicting rapid regime change followed by instability misreads UNDEF’s niche and risks (bullet point 19 — Index 19) and ignores the political sensitivity that would actually constrain such outcomes (bullet point 16 and 17 — Index 16 and 17).",
                "2": "Correct. Supporting non‑partisan, SDG‑focused civic monitoring is likely to improve governance and service delivery (bullet point 15 — Index 15), thereby reducing drivers of instability in neighbouring states and serving non‑kinetic security interests (bullet point 18 — Index 18). If funding is modest, conditional, compliant with domestic laws and accompanied by clear communication and safeguards, it can signal India’s commitment to democratic norms with limited domestic controversy (bullet point 16 and 17 — Index 16 and 17). This aligns with UNDEF’s small‑grant, localised niche that requires M&E and protections (bullet point 19 — Index 19).",

UNDEF‑style programmes tend to be narrowly focused on accountability and service delivery rather than forcing geopolitical realignment (bullet points 15 and 19 — Index 15 and 19). Domestic responses will vary and can be managed through legal compliance and communication (bullet point 17 — Index 17)."

The bullet states UNDEF demonstrates how international institutions can operationalize democracy support in ways that intersect with security and development objectives — buttressing democratic resilience and SDG accountability while managing risks and legal/political contexts.
