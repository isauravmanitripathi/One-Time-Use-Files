While some critics argued trusteeship could resemble continued control, the contemporaneous evidence (the Majuro sign) is better read as a demand for the end of trusteeship consistent with aspirations for self‑government rather than proof of total institutional failure.

The strongest normative objection focuses on mandate fidelity: the Trusteeship Council’s founding purpose was to supervise trust territories as part of the post‑World War II decolonization framework (bullet 0).
