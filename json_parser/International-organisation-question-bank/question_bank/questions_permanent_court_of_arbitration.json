While the adviser is right to reject the exclusive-UN-membership claim, it is incorrect to suggest that cooperation with the PCA subjects a State to direct supervision by the UN Secretariat over PCA-administered cases. The PCA’s institutional independence means UN Secretariat supervision does not apply (see bullets [5] and [1]).",

While the compromis defines the legal and factual perimeter, tribunals have traditionally interpreted reasonably related remedies as falling within that perimeter if they address the questions submitted.

The bullet cautions that PCA jurisprudence is useful for doctrinal guidance but warns against relying solely on domestic measures; it recommends prudent, legally informed statecraft that integrates adjudication with broader policy—not avoidance of adjudication altogether.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Exclusive reliance on adjudication ignores the enforcement and political limits highlighted in the bullet. The PCA offers doctrinal guidance but outcomes are tied to consent and political realities, so adjudication alone may be insufficient to manage the trade‑offs.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Prioritizing investor protection at the expense of sovereignty may be politically or strategically untenable; the bullet emphasizes balancing maritime rights and investor protection and warns of enforcement and political constraints, so an unbalanced approach is not recommended.",
                "3": "Correct. This option captures the central lesson: PCA jurisprudence provides legal guidance on sovereignty and investor protection, but policymakers should integrate adjudication into a broader strategy (diplomatic, domestic policy) because enforcement and political acceptance are not guaranteed—matching the bullet’s recommendation for prudence in using international adjudication."

Investor–state arbitration is only one strand of PCA’s caseload and does not by itself provide the full precedent framework for maritime or territorial disputes; national security policy requires broader consideration of sovereignty, delimitation, and political enforcement issues highlighted in the bullet.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The bullet warns that PCA outcomes are tied to state consent and political realities; jurisprudence is instructive but does not remove the need for diplomacy or regional politics.",
                "2": "Correct. This option aligns with the bullet’s synthesis: PCA jurisprudence offers doctrinal guidance on sovereignty and maritime rights useful for policy formulation, but policymakers must recognize enforcement limits and the role of political context when applying legal principles to national security.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The bullet does not advise abandoning international jurisprudence; rather, it recommends using PCA cases prudently as part of legally informed statecraft. Dismissing international law entirely would ignore valuable doctrinal guidance."

                "1": "Incorrect. The bullet explicitly lists investor–state arbitration as one among several areas in the PCA’s case history, which also includes territorial sovereignty, maritime delimitation and jurisdiction, and fisheries. Thus the PCA does have relevant precedents beyond investor–state cases.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Enforcement through domestic courts is not automatic; the bullet warns about enforcement limits and the need to integrate adjudication into broader statecraft, including diplomatic efforts to secure compliance.",
