The EPO is the executive organ responsible for substantive examination and grant (bullet point 2), but it does not handle post‑grant enforcement or national-level formalities—those remain with national authorities or the UPC/unitary system after grant (bullet points 3 and 6).

                "3": "Correct. The text advises users to always verify current status on the EPO’s official website and consult the EPC for entry‑into‑force dates because statuses (e.g., accessions, validations) change over time and have direct strategic and legal implications for filing and post‑grant steps (Bullet 16)."

                "0": "Incorrect. Signing an extension or validation agreement does not mean the state surrenders its sovereign IP policy. These arrangements allow national effect of EPO grants but do not equate to full membership or loss of policy autonomy; the layered approach is explicitly presented as preserving tailored engagement (Bullets 14 and 15).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While validation/extension involve legal formalities, they have important policy significance: they are instruments that enable states to engage with international patent systems in a calibrated manner without immediate full harmonisation, affecting access to innovation and strategic choices (Bullet 14 and 15).",
                "2": "Correct. This captures the nuance emphasized in the bullet points: extension and validation mechanisms illustrate a calibrated pathway to international IP linkages that preserve a state's ability to tailor engagement according to national priorities, therefore they are more than mere administrative conveniences (Bullet 14 and 15).",
                "3": "Incorrect. The statement is factually unsupported. The bullet points make no distinction based on state size, and validation/extension are available mechanisms irrespective of a state's population or size; moreover, the EPO has provisions and examples of varied states engaging through these mechanisms (Bullet 16 advises checking current statuses, but does not limit eligibility by size)."
