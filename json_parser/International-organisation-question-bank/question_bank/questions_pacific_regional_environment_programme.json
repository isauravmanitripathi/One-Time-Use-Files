Bullet points 2 and 3 list these territories and their administering states; bullet point 4 highlights that mixed legal personalities affect treaty‑making capacity and legal obligations, making directly binding commitments more legally complex for these entities.",

Bullet point 4 emphasizes the mixed legal personalities within SPREP and how degrees of international personality and treaty‑making capacity differ across members, so a blanket statement of equal capacity is wrong.",

Bullet point 3 explicitly notes that the Cook Islands and Niue are self‑governing in free association and exercise international personality; bullet point 4 contrasts these with other non‑sovereign forms, so they are less likely to be the primary constraint in concluding binding agreements.",

                "0": "Incorrect. A donor-managed, top-down approach undermines regional ownership and may increase volatility rather than predictability (Bullet 11). Immediate domestic legal imposition without differentiated assistance ignores capacity asymmetries (Bullet 11 and lesson 4).",
                "1": "Correct. This option mirrors SPREP lessons (Bullet 13): institutionalisation to build regional ownership (lesson 1), integration of environmental governance with security/development institutions (lesson 2), pragmatic acceptance of design trade-offs by retaining inclusive rules while mitigating their limits (lesson 3), and using predictable pooled financing plus differentiated capacity-building (lesson 4). It balances legitimacy with practical levers.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Bilateral platforms under Indian control risk undermining regional ownership (contradicts lesson 1) and insisting on majority voting ignores the political acceptability concerns SPREP faced (Bullet 11 and lesson 3). Avoiding integration with security institutions contravenes lesson 2.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Rapidly imposing a binding treaty administered externally neglects the need for regional ownership and capacity/financing supports (lessons 1 and 4). SPREP shows external administration without local institutionalisation weakens legitimacy (Bullet 13)."
