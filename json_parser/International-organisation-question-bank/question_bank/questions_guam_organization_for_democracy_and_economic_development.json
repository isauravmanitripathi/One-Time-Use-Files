                "1": "Incorrect. Immediate collective accession to the EU/NATO was unrealistic given the members' domestic conditions and international constraints. The charter (Bullet 3) committed members to accelerate European integration as a goal, but not to instant bloc accession; the process was framed as gradual and normative rather than an immediate legal step.",
                "2": "Correct. The formation of GUAM reflected a desire to institutionalise cooperation outside Russian‑dominated mechanisms, advance democratization and sovereignty, and exploit strategic transport/energy corridors linking the Black Sea and beyond. Bullets 0 and 1 point to an informal consultative forum with normative and strategic aims; Bullet 3 (the Yalta charter) shows later formalisation around democratic and Euro‑Atlantic objectives, and Bullet 2 highlights geographic/connectivity ambitions.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While countering Russian dominance was a motivation, the historical record shows GUAM began as an informal consultative forum focused on political norms, sovereignty and economic corridors rather than a military containment pact. Bullet 0 emphasises diversification away from Russian‑dominated structures and normative goals rather than military alliance formation."

While extending geographic reach had implications for access and transit (Bullet 2), the archival evidence points to broader connectivity and strategic aims rather than a narrow objective of securing Black Sea port access. Furthermore, the withdrawal’s timing is linked to political events (Bullet 4), not new sea routes.",
                "1": "Correct. Uzbekistan’s accession (Bullet 2) expanded GUUAM’s geographic reach into Central Asia and raised prospects for linking Black Sea and Central Asian transit corridors. Its withdrawal in 2005 followed the Andijan crackdown and increasing international criticism; Bullet 4 explains that domestic political crises and regime security considerations precipitated estrangement from Western‑oriented forums and the official notification of withdrawal.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Uzbekistan’s membership was not a durable, irreversible pro‑Western realignment. The six‑year membership (1999–2005) ended decisively after domestic repression and the international fallout from Andijan (Bullet 4), indicating that domestic politics rather than only economic factors drove the exit.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While tensions could involve normative disagreements, the proximate cause of Uzbekistan’s definitive estrangement was the Andijan events in 2005 and resulting international condemnation (Bullet 4). The withdrawal was explicitly linked to regime security concerns and distancing from Western‑oriented forums, not merely charter text disputes."

Militarisation could alienate potential external investors and partners and is inconsistent with the grouping’s historical emphasis.",
                "1": "Correct. Historical experience shows GUAM started as a consultative forum that sought gradual institutionalisation and normative clarity (Bullets 1 and 3). Its strategic salience derived from transport and energy corridors (Bullet 0) and the expansion into Central Asia via Uzbekistan (Bullet 2). Revitalisation therefore requires stronger institutions, engagement with external patrons for investment and political support, and harmonised legal/regulatory regimes—an approach consistent with past practice and constraints.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While Uzbekistan’s geographic position mattered (Bullet 2), the historical record (Bullet 4) shows that membership is sensitive to domestic politics; treating Uzbekistan’s re‑entry as a panacea ignores the institutional, financial and political work required to build corridors. Successful revival needs multilateral institutionalisation and external financing rather than relying on one country’s participation alone.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Centralising decisions in one member would undermine the multilateral, consultative nature of GUAM and risk domestic political pushback; historically GUAM’s effectiveness depended on cooperative institutional mechanisms (Bullets 1 and 3). Additionally, no single member had the capacity or legitimacy to unilaterally implement cross‑regional corridor projects."

                "1": "Correct. The 2001 Yalta charter formalised GUUAM's commitment to democratic values, Euro‑Atlantic integration, security and sustainable development (Bullet 3). This normative codification sharpened ideological expectations and thereby exposed sensitivity to domestic political developments in member states; when Uzbekistan faced the Andijan crisis and international condemnation, tensions and ultimate withdrawal followed (Bullet 4).",

The Uzbekistan case (Bullets 2 and 4) shows that when a member state experienced significant internal repression (Andijan, 2005), international condemnation and regime security considerations produced estrangement from Western‑oriented forums.
