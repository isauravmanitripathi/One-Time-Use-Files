IRRI’s founding model combined the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations’ technical capacity and funding with the Government of the Philippines as host (bullet points 1 and 3). This tripartite arrangement provided scientific leadership, access to philanthropic networks for translation and dissemination, and host‑country resources (land, political backing) needed for field trials and long‑term experimentation (bullets 0 and 2). That combination enabled focused applied research and rapid diffusion characteristic of the Green Revolution linkage (bullet 4).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While multilateral agencies can provide neutrality and legitimacy, IRRI’s origin depended on concentrated philanthropic technical leadership and funding rather than being driven mainly by a UN agency. The Ford and Rockefeller Foundations supplied central organisational and applied research impetus (bullet 3), a dynamic that differs from standard multilateral funding models.",
                "2": "Incorrect. A fully decentralized network without a stable central site would limit the ability to conduct coordinated long‑term field trials, germplasm collections and experimentation in tropical ecologies—roles that IRRI’s Los Baños site performed and that helped form its institutional identity and operational strength (bullet 2).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Corporate ownership might accelerate commercialization but could compromise public‑good objectives, restrict open germplasm exchange, and shift priorities from broad food security to profit. IRRI’s effectiveness derived from philanthropic commitment to a public‑good research agenda and host‑state partnership (bullets 1 and 3), not private corporate control."

A temperate capital would impair these core experimental functions and reduce the representativeness of results.",

Donor interest is not primarily determined by remoteness; in IRRI’s case, philanthropic foundations actively supported locating the institute where it could do relevant experiments (bullets 1 and 3).

While safeguarding autonomy is important, the cluster’s first lesson shows that deep technical challenges are often addressed through transnational public–private institutions that combine philanthropic capital, scientific authority and host‑state anchoring (Bullet 11). Total rejection would forgo benefits of cooperation that materially contributed to food security (Bullet 8).",
