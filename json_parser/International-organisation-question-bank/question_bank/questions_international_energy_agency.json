                "Grant full membership provisionally while the country builds stocks, relying on political commitment to meet the 90‑day level later.",

                "0": "Incorrect. The IEA’s rules (IEP Agreement) set explicit operational criteria for full membership, including OECD membership and the 90‑day stock obligation. A provisional full membership contradicts the legal and operational requirements: the Agency retains formal entry conditions rather than ad hoc provisional admittance (bullets 3, 5, 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While demand‑reduction plans and efficiency commitments are essential (and required of members in emergencies), they do not replace the formal stockholding and OECD membership conditions for full membership. The IEA converts paper commitments into practical emergency tools, but the 90‑day net import stock rule is a specific operational precondition (bullets 6, 7, 2).",
                "2": "Correct. The IEA requires prospective full members to be OECD members and to hold emergency oil stocks equal to 90 days of net imports; countries that cannot meet these criteria are typically offered partnership or association arrangements for cooperation, while full membership is withheld until formal criteria (OECD status and stock obligations) are satisfied. This balances inclusiveness with the Agency’s practical focus on collective preparedness (bullets 5, 6, 3, 1).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Automatic admission without meeting the stock and OECD criteria would undermine the IEA’s founding aim to ensure reliable supplies through shared, enforceable obligations. The Agency institutionalised concrete obligations (like the 90‑day rule) to prevent future energy shocks, so enlargement without those safeguards would weaken collective preparedness (bullets 0, 1, 6)."

The IEA’s Association Programme is explicitly designed to let non‑members engage in its work without full membership, giving access to statistics, analysis, and cooperation while avoiding full political commitments (bullet 4). This route lets a country benefit from the IEA’s Emergency Response System frameworks, data and modelling (bullets 5 and 6) while retaining more policy autonomy than full membership would likely entail (bullet 0).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Full membership can grant greater formal influence in governance, but the IEA’s origins and membership composition (established under the OECD in 1974 and historically representing industrialised economies) mean full membership can involve political and institutional commitments that may impinge on strategic autonomy and require long-term alignment with member priorities (bullets 1 and 4). It may also be slower and politically costly than other engagement modes.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Building independent capacity for data and SPRs is necessary, but exclusive reliance on domestic measures forfeits the advantages of international statistical comparability, scenario analysis, and coordinated emergency mechanisms provided by the IEA (bullets 2, 6 and 7). A hybrid approach — domestic strengthening plus association with the IEA — is generally more effective.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Bilateral arrangements can yield targeted benefits but are less likely to provide the comprehensive, standardised statistics, scenario modelling and multilateral emergency coordination frameworks that the IEA offers (bullets 2 and 6). Bilateral ties also leave gaps in comparability and multilateral legitimacy that the IEA’s collective mechanisms supply."

While full membership provides the most comprehensive rights and a seat at the core decision table, the cluster indicates that association programmes, partnerships and outreach enable meaningful cooperation on statistics, best practices and crisis coordination without full membership.

The cluster emphasizes that participation can reduce vulnerability to supply shocks through pooled responses and improve strategic foresight; the claim that engagement only increases vulnerability is one-sided and ignores reciprocal benefits (Bullet points 1 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Informal engagement without data-sharing or peer review would not realistically provide the full benefits of membership (data, networks, visibility and policy advice). The IEA’s reciprocity principle means benefits are tied to obligations (Bullet points 0 and 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Full accession brings clear obligations — regular data sharing, adherence to collective emergency arrangements and participation in peer reviews — which can constrain unilateral emergency policy options. It is not true that accession imposes no meaningful constraints (Bullet points 2 and 3).",
                "3": "Correct. This captures the nuanced strategic calculus described: association or selective peer-review engagement can provide access to IEA data, analytical products and networks (benefits, Bullet point 1) while allowing India to limit commitments that would bind its unilateral emergency responses (trade-offs and sovereignty concerns, Bullet points 3 and 5). It reflects weighing mutual gains against sovereignty costs (Bullet points 5 and 6)."

The Davos episode shows how such narratives are contested precisely because of these stakes (bullets 0 and 4).",
