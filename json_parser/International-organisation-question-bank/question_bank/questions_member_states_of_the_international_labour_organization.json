Article 1 clause 4 provides the constitutional pathway for non‑UN entities: admission by the International Labour Conference requires a qualified political decision — a two‑thirds vote of delegates present, and that two‑thirds must include two‑thirds of government delegates.

This answer integrates main lessons: treaty obligations often persist after withdrawal (bullet 8); withdrawal is blunt and rarely cancels legal obligations (bullet 12); and the ILO’s pattern — all 19 withdrawing states were later readmitted — shows that withdrawal does not reliably eliminate scrutiny or consequences and is reversible depending on domestic politics and reforms (bullet 9).",
                "1": "Partially correct but incomplete. While withdrawal can reduce short‑term fiscal or political costs (e.g., due non‑payment motives in Lesotho and Vietnam — bullet 11), it fails to account for legal persistence and the likelihood of eventual readmission or continued obligations (bullets 8 and 9).",
                "2": "Incorrect. This contradicts the documented ILO experience: withdrawal does not reliably remove legal obligations (bullet 8) and can impose reputational and political costs rather than serving as a reliable escape hatch (bullet 12).",
                "3": "Incorrect. The existence of replacement agreements is not a precondition observed in ILO cases. The primary constraints are legal persistence and reputational dynamics (bullets 8, 9, 12), not the technical act of concluding replacement treaties."

                "1": "Incorrect. There is no blanket ILO rule of automatic continuity tied to any regime change. In this instance continuity resulted from the specific procedural fact that the withdrawal was rescinded before its effective date; the political context (regime change from Sukarno to Suharto) explains why the rescission occurred but is not itself a procedural basis for continuity (bullets 3, 4).",
                "2": "Incorrect. UN membership or a UN withdrawal announcement is not an automatic determinant of ILO membership.

                "1": "Incorrect. While capacity constraints are often cited, the bullet point emphasizes that the decision to remain outside the ILO is rarely attributable to a single factor. Treating it as purely administrative overlooks political, legal and strategic considerations.",

This option directly mirrors the bullet point’s main insight: non‑membership reflects an intersection of domestic legal self‑perception, small‑state policy imperatives, capacity constraints and overarching political strategy, revealing how states weigh international engagement against sovereignty, development models and political stability.",

Immediate full accession may undermine domestic political stability or clash with national legal self‑perception if reforms are politically sensitive; the bullet point suggests states weigh engagement against sovereignty and stability, favoring calibrated approaches."
