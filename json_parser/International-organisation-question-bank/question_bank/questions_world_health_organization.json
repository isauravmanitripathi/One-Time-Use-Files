Forming a coalition to pool flexible funds and engaging philanthropies via multilateral mechanisms exploits the practical complementarities of non‑state actors (surveillance, R&D, delivery) while countering single‑donor agenda setting.

This nuanced critique aligns with the cluster: while financial contributions matter, structural features—small assessed core vs large earmarked voluntary funds—mean that broader strategies (coalition‑building, governance/transparency reforms, strategic engagement with philanthropies, and strengthening domestic/regional capacity) are necessary to reduce vulnerability to politicised funding (bullets 11, 12, 13, 7).",

Temporal comparisons often reveal layered motives: mature landscaping indicates custodial continuity, while glazed entries, new barriers and signage point to responses to new security regimes, accessibility requirements and representational strategies (bullet 5).
