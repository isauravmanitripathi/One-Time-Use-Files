Bullet 1 explains that IOTC was established by a multilateral treaty (the Agreement) approved by the FAO Council and that it entered into force after acceptance by the tenth party.

Bullet point 13 highlights that the opinion alters expectations about licensing, enforcement, reporting and negotiation of access arrangements and intensifies regional pressure to recognize Mauritius as the coastal authority. The practical consequence is likely greater routing of negotiations through Mauritius or multilateral processes, plus demands for harmonized reporting and enforcement cooperation.",
                "1": "Incorrect. There is no basis in the cluster to suggest the IOTC would dissolve; rather, the opinion produces a reclassification within IOTC terms and pressures the institution and states to adapt governance and reporting arrangements.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The cluster suggests the opposite: the opinion makes regional, multilateral engagement (e.g., recognizing Mauritius’ functional authority) more salient, rather than replacing regional cooperation with bilateral UK‑state deals.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The cluster points to increased transparency and standardized practices, not a turn toward secrecy. States are more likely to press for clearer, multilateral arrangements to manage the legal ambiguity created by the advisory opinion."
