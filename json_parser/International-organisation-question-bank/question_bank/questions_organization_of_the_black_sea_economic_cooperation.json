While observers can participate in technical work (bullet 5), the cluster does not state they automatically receive voting rights in technical committees; generally decision‑making and formal voting power reside with members (bullet 4). Assuming automatic veto/blocking powers overstates typical observer privileges.",

Bullets 0 and 1 emphasize that BSEC centers on economic cooperation while explicitly aiming to foster peace and stability; bullet 1 and bullet 6 (PERMIS functions) explain how programmatic activity and dialogue create indirect security benefits and space for political engagement, but do not promise instant conflict resolution.",

The EAEU configures tariffs, standards and market access across member states (Bullet 2), so engaging at the bloc level helps India anticipate and address bloc-wide preferences.

This multilevel engagement aligns with the analytic inference that India should anticipate bloc-level preferences while using bilateral channels (Bullet 0 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While bilateral agreements can yield benefits, ignoring the EAEU is risky because the EAEU establishes customs union arrangements, collective tariff/standards regimes and regulatory harmonization that affect market access across its members (Bullet 1 and 2). Bilateral goodwill cannot override bloc-level legal and administrative frameworks, so this approach is unlikely to minimize regulatory friction.",

Informal confirmations may be useful but are insufficient as a sole verification mechanism; they lack the documentary corroboration and risk acting on unreliable verbal assurances. This falls short of the recommended cross‑checking and institutional safeguards (bullets 14 and 17).",

This option implements a multi-layered verification: cross-checking PERMIS (bullet 17) with shared digital repositories (bullet 14) and direct contact with coordinators plus a brief field audit reduces the chances of acting on stale or incorrect data. It combines durable institutional practices and operational verification, aligning with bullets 14 and 17.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Relying solely on PERMIS ignores the caution in bullet 17 to cross‑check operational details and risks acting on outdated or incomplete information. The recommendation explicitly advises cross‑checking against PERMIS rather than treating it as the only source.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Waiting for a formal rotation ceremony delays action and risks inaction or missed opportunities. It does not proactively verify records or preserve momentum, contrary to the emphasis on continuity and timely verification in bullets 14 and 17."
