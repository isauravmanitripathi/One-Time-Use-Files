While the 2007 Agreement gave the MSG a legal personality enabling external relations, it did not make the MSG equivalent to sovereign states in treaty‑making capacity.

A conditional associate‑member framework recognises the reality of Indonesia’s regional linkages while using the MSG’s institutional capacities (established under the 2007 Agreement) to require transparency, human‑rights dialogue and formal consultative safeguards for non‑state members like FLNKS.

A strict non‑intervention posture avoids immediate confrontation but risks eroding the MSG's credibility given its institutional capacity to articulate collective positions.

                "1": "Correct. Expanding MSG product schedules from 4 to 6 digits aligned the grouping’s tariff headings with the international Harmonized System (HS) six-digit standard (bullet 4). That alignment typically reduces ambiguity in customs classification, lowers administrative and compliance costs, and makes preferential rules of origin and tariff preferences under agreements (such as the MSG Trade Agreement of 1993 — bullet 1) easier to apply in practice. Technical harmonisation (refer to bullet 3) is intended to improve trade facilitation rather than being a mere formality.",

The change from 4- to 6-digit headings is more than a technicality: it aligns the MSG with international customs classification norms (bullet 4) and supports practical implementation of the 1993 trade agreement (bullet 1). This has measurable effects on reducing classification disputes, streamlining customs procedures and enabling smoother preferential trade.",

While greater harmonisation does constrain ad-hoc national variation in classification practices, moving to the internationally accepted HS 6-digit headings does not itself force uniform external tariff policy across sovereign members.

                "2": "Correct. This option captures the multi-dimensional reality: demographic and economic scale confer bargaining leverage (Index 5, 6, 7, 8), but those advantages are mediated by political sensitivities around Indonesia’s subnational representation and the inclusion of independence movements (Index 9), as well as small states’ capacity constraints (Index 5).
