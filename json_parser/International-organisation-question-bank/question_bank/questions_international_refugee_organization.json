The Search demonstrates that narrative films can significantly affect public perceptions by making distant crises emotionally resonant; it combined professional stars with real DP contexts to influence audiences (bullet point 2). Saying such films have negligible impact ignores their rhetorical power.",

The Search (1948), supported by the IRO, used narrative cinema with star power and award‑winning child performances to render the refugee crisis emotionally legible to broad publics (bullet points 1 and 2). Such personalization tends to build empathy and can create political space for humanitarian policies and funding.",
