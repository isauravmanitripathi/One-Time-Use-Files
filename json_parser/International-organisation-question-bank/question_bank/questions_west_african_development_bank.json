Relying on English as the working language (a common pragmatic choice) risks excluding francophone/lusophone stakeholders during negotiations and can create asymmetries in influence. Bullet 0 indicates sensitivity to multiple languages; post‑hoc translation can miss nuances and weaken equitable participation. It also sidelines BCEAO involvement and regional governance dynamics (bullets 3–4).",

A trilingual approach with bilingual liaison officers directly addresses cross‑linguistic inclusivity and reduces misinterpretation. Involving the BCEAO (bullets 3 and 4) recognizes the bank's embeddedness in regional monetary and governance frameworks, helping align program design with regional policy and strengthening legitimacy among member governments.",

Additionally, imposing only two languages may still disadvantage some stakeholders and ignores the need to integrate BCEAO and member governments into negotiation processes (bullets 3–4). Cost savings do not outweigh risks to equitable participation."
