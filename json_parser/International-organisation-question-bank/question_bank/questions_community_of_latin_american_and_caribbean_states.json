Therefore, it is unlikely that trade and development would be wholly sidelined in favor of ideology.",

The summit combined calls for deeper intra‑regional coordination and a desire for greater autonomy (bullets 1 and 2) with explicit anti‑hegemonic rhetoric that sought institutional alternatives to U.S. influence (bullet 3). This mix makes it likely CELAC will strengthen regional voice and cooperation while also creating parallel institutions and potential duplication with bodies like the OAS — producing both increased autonomy and institutional friction rather than seamless replacement.",
                "2": "Incorrect. There is no evidence that CELAC would immediately impose coordinated sanctions isolating the U.S. and Canada. The forum was conceived as an intra‑regional coordination mechanism (bullet 1) and external actors, notably the U.S., adopted a cautious \"watch and see\" approach (bullet 6), suggesting a more measured dynamic than abrupt economic isolation.",

Although some leaders (e.g., Hugo Chávez) suggested CELAC could supplant the OAS (bullet 3), member states were heterogeneous (bullet 4 and 5) and many preferred pragmatic economic cooperation (bullet 4). The summit’s composition and cautious external reactions (bullet 6) point toward gradual, contested change rather than an immediate and total institutional takeover."

The summit had a clear stated focus on trade expansion and economic development amid the global financial crisis (bullet 0 and 1), and centrist leaders emphasized these pragmatic priorities (bullet 4).

CELAC’s founding reflected a preference for intergovernmental coordination, strengthening ties with subregional mechanisms, and responsible inclusion (Bahia Declaration priorities and the deliberate pairing of co‑chairs). Given the uneven early buy‑in, pragmatic institutional choices — continuity mechanisms, consultative and rotational procedures, and a focus on cooperative (non‑binding) agendas like disaster response and social development — best align with the organization’s character and increase legitimacy (bullets 1, 3, 5, 6).",

Inviting the United States and Canada to join would run counter to one of the foundational motives for CELAC — to create a forum less dependent on Washington and Ottawa and to enhance regional autonomy. The original membership deliberately excluded those two countries (bullets 0, 3).",

Creating a supranational federation with binding enforcement contradicts CELAC’s intergovernmental origins and would likely exacerbate resistance from states wary of ceding sovereignty.

This option integrates the CELAC lessons: it uses soft power and human‑capital investment to build normative influence while respecting sovereignty through co‑design and flexibility (Bullet Point 16 and 14).
