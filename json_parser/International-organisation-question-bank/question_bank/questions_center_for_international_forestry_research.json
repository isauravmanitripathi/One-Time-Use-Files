Integrating infrastructure planning with land‑use regulations, tenure clarity and livelihood safeguards aligns with CIFOR’s mandate to shape policy and reconcile forest management with forest-dependent livelihoods (bullets 1 and 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Biodiversity offsets and private financing can be part of solutions but, by themselves, they often fail to address root drivers such as agricultural expansion, infrastructure siting and governance weaknesses that CIFOR highlights (bullets 3 and 4). Offsets risk legitimizing loss rather than preventing landscape-level change that affects livelihoods (bullet 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Strict protected areas may reduce certain pressures but excluding local use can undermine the livelihoods and rights of forest-dependent people, a core concern of CIFOR’s mandate (bullet 2). Moreover, CIFOR recognizes drivers beyond protection—infrastructure and agricultural policy must be managed in an integrated way (bullets 3 and 4).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Stronger law enforcement is important (bullet 4) but CIFOR stresses that drivers frequently lie outside the forestry sector and therefore enforcement alone—after the fact—won’t address upstream decisions on infrastructure and agricultural policy that cause land‑use change (bullets 3 and 4)."
