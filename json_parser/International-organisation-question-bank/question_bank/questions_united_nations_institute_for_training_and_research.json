By funding targeted programmes aligned with India’s priorities—disaster resilience, maritime humanitarian coordination, capacity assistance to neighbouring LDCs and SIDS (Bullet 10)—India can project soft power and acquire comparative policy knowledge (Bullet 9).

This option combines structural and diplomatic measures that mitigate the impact of shorter leadership rotations: an engaged Board provides strategic oversight and fiduciary continuity (Bullet Point Index 9), formalized multi‑year partnerships and knowledge‑management address loss of institutional memory associated with shorter tenures (Bullet Point Index 7), and diplomatic engagement with the Secretary‑General’s office preserves influence over appointments and priorities (Bullet Point Index 12).

The CIFAL network's decentralised, locally embedded approach (Index 7) and its suitability for subnational engagement (Index 11) can produce uneven uptake across states. Without central coordination or harmonisation mechanisms, different states might adapt international norms divergently, leading to policy fragmentation and potential federal tensions. Managing this requires careful alignment between state initiatives and national frameworks (Index 12).",

While increased subnational engagement with international actors raises governance questions, it does not automatically cause constitutional invalidation or a wholesale loss of central authority.
