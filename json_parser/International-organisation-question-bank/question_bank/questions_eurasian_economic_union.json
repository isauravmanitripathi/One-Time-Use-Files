Voluntarist or opt‑in designs are more compatible with the CIS political baseline (Bullet 1) and the flexible approach to integration (Bullet 2 and Bullet 0). However, the question asks for the most accurate assessment of creating a permanent court with compulsory jurisdiction — compulsory jurisdiction would still run contrary to the non‑supranational intent, even if membership were voluntary.",
                "1": "Correct. The Belavezha Accords (Dec 1991) emphasized state sovereignty and territorial integrity and explicitly articulated cooperation 'without creating a supranational state' (Bullet 1). While later instruments (e.g. CIS Agreement Article 7) envisage coordination via common institutions (Bullet 2), the political and legal baseline established in 1991 constrains the acceptability of any permanent body with compulsory supranational jurisdiction. The broader historical trajectory also shows a preference for flexible, intergovernmental mechanisms rather than ceding sovereignty to supranational organs (Bullet 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The 1993 Treaty on the Creation of an Economic Union set stepwise objectives (free trade area, customs union, free movement) but did not establish a permanent supranational court with compulsory jurisdiction (Bullet 3). The treaty envisaged deeper economic integration steps, not the immediate creation of supranational judicial bodies.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Although Article 7 of the CIS Agreement (8 Dec 1991) prescribes coordinated activity through common institutions (Bullet 2), this must be read against the Belavezha Accords’ clear political commitment to sovereignty and avoidance of a supranational state (Bullet 1). Thus invoking Article 7 alone overstates the permissiveness of the founding framework."

The text notes that the accession protocol never entered into force because several key parties did not ratify it (including Ukraine and others) and that this 'limited Ukraine’s participation in deeper, legally binding integration projects' (Bullet 4). Deeper commitments like customs unions or surrendering autonomous trade instruments typically require ratified treaties, so non‑ratification kept Ukraine outside those binding arrangements.",
                "1": "Incorrect. MFN obligations are WTO concepts applying between WTO members; non‑ratification of a CIS accession protocol did not automatically place Ukraine under other CIS members’ WTO MFN obligations. Moreover, the cluster distinguishes between regional treaty practice and WTO rules (Bullet 6); non‑ratification affected Ukraine’s legal standing within CIS/Economic Union instruments rather than automatically altering WTO status.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Non‑ratification of the accession protocol did not preclude Ukraine from concluding future bilateral or trilateral arrangements—such arrangements are separate instruments (see Bullet 6). The failure to ratify limited participation in the specific multiliteral Economic Union framework but did not legally prohibit bilateral deals.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Signature alone does not generally create binding obligations absent ratification; the cluster explicitly notes that the Ukraine accession protocol never entered into force because it lacked ratification (Bullet 4). Therefore Ukraine was not fully bound in the same way as those who ratified."

Using synthetic control as a robustness check for prominent cases addresses concerns about a suitable control group.

The Eurasian Economic Commission was explicitly designed as the supranational regulatory agency to centralise rule‑making and oversee implementation (bullet 4). Where a national measure conflicts with Union commitments, the EEC can advance harmonisation or mutual recognition and EAEU dispute-resolution mechanisms can be invoked; this pathway directly addresses the institutional remit and is consistent with the Union’s legal architecture (bullets 3 and 4).

The cluster records a real instance of a mid‑chairmanship leadership change in Kyrgyzstan in 2017 (bullet 4) and the institutional description emphasises that the presidency rotates among member states and that agenda‑setting is a function of the chairing state (bullet 1).

The EEU’s pivot to Asia is framed and pursued as a diversification strategy: it seeks new markets (ASEAN, Vietnam, India, Israel), leverages its members’ transit geography for connectivity (rail/road/energy corridors), and aims to reduce dependence on any single partner or corridor—objectives consistently reflected in its institutional outreach and connectivity negotiations (bullets 0 and 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While energy and resource corridors are relevant (Korea’s initiative includes energy), the EEU’s stated measures are broader—targeting manufacturing supply chains, transit connectivity, trade regimes and institutional cooperation across East and South Asia—not merely resource extraction deals (bullets 2, 3, 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Cooperation with China’s BRI is an important element but the EEU is not positioning this as an exclusive replacement for Western finance. The union is simultaneously engaging other actors (South Korea, ASEAN, Vietnam, Israel, India) to balance financing, standards and corridors—showing a diversification rather than single‑partner dependence (bullets 4, 3, 5, 6).",

While geopolitics inevitably colors international economic choices, the EEU’s actions (institutional talks with ASEAN, FTAs with Vietnam, expert groups on Israel/India, and engagement with Korea and China) are oriented toward expanding trade, transit and market access rather than forming security or military alliances.

The technical constraint of differing gauges requires practical solutions (transshipment, bogie-change, dual-gauge) that affect handling costs and throughput (Bullet 9). The nature of financing and implementation by Chinese SOEs/policy banks creates durable financial and governance linkages and influences cost, contractual terms and long-term viability (Bullet 7). Lianyungang’s role as gateway is relevant to throughput potential (Bullet 8). These factors together most directly determine commercial viability.",

If a member state tried to sign a purely national goods FTA, it could not legitimately alter the EAEU's common external tariff or unified rules of origin unilaterally — those effects are governed by Union competence (bullet point 0).

The EEU’s geopolitical leverage rests on its large hydrocarbon endowment (bullet 3) and the strategic arteries—pipelines and rail—through which those resources reach markets (bullet 4). Reducing demand via renewables and efficiency, and diversifying supply with LNG and non‑EEU pipeline sources, attacks leverage on both the demand and supplier sides. Over 5–15 years this reduces market power, increases supply security and diminishes the strategic value of EEU corridors (bullets 3 and 4). This approach also mitigates risks stemming from the EEU’s concentration of production in low‑density, politically centralized areas (bullet 0, bullet 5).",

It ignores the economic root causes (resource concentration and lack of diversified supply) and could escalate geopolitical tensions; moreover, control is difficult across the vast low‑density terrain described in the EEU (bullet 0) and is not a constructive energy policy.",
