The Arabic-language Charter that mandates harmonisation in defence and foreign policy (bullets 4 and 6) provides the legal and normative foundation for coordinated action.

Pegging to the US dollar avoids establishing a common monetary authority but sacrifices independent monetary policy and the coordinated framework needed for a lasting single currency.

                "2": "Why correct: PPP GDP per capita is more informative for cross-country comparisons of living standards because it adjusts for price-level differences (bullet 11).

Aggregate GCC hydrocarbon wealth and policy choices have direct implications for India's macroeconomic stability (bullet 13 and 8).",

              "options": [
                "Publicly align with the US–GCC security initiatives by joining joint exercises and offering basing/logistical access to Western forces to demonstrate solidarity and secure energy supplies.",

                "0": "Why option A is incorrect: Accepting basing/logistics offers and publicly aligning with US–GCC security steps could secure nearer‑term interoperability benefits (bullet 2 and 3) but risks constraining India’s diplomatic manoeuvrability with Iran and some GCC states that have independent ties with Tehran (bullet 3 and 4). It also needlessly ties India’s posture to external coalition dynamics rather than preserving strategic autonomy (bullet 0).",
                "1": "Why option B is correct: This option balances security and economic concerns. Diversifying energy suppliers and expanding strategic petroleum reserves addresses energy‑security implications arising from joint statements about market stability and production (bullet 4) while strengthening naval and maritime domain awareness protects India’s lines of communication, evacuation planning and regional deterrence (bullet 2 and 3). It preserves diplomatic space to engage both GCC states and Iran rather than forcing a public alignment (bullet 0 and 6).",
                "2": "Why option C is incorrect: While diplomacy is valuable, attempting to broker a public détente as a principal response and simultaneously reducing naval posture misreads the situation. The joint statement’s emphasis on defence cooperation and maritime security (bullets 2 and 3) implies persistent risks to shipping and regional stability; diminishing naval readiness would undermine India’s ability to protect its interests (bullet 2 and 3).",
                "3": "Why option D is incorrect: Imposing punitive trade measures on GCC states would be counterproductive economically and diplomatically. GCC countries are major energy suppliers and sources of investment for India (bullet 4), and punitive measures would reduce India’s leverage and harm energy security while offering little to change their alignment with the US (bullet 6)."

Simultaneously, India can exploit openings by crafting complementary bilateral initiatives—energy deals, security dialogues, or contingency planning—that operate alongside US–GCC coordination (bullet 4 and 2). This answer captures both constraint and opportunity.",

Many GCC states have longstanding ties with India and economic interdependence (bullet 4), so hostility is unlikely as a direct outcome.",
                "3": "Why option D is incorrect: The joint reaffirmation tends to align GCC foreign policy more closely with the US, not to free them to pivot rapidly to third parties. So increased freedom to pivot toward India is not the most likely primary implication (bullet 6)."

While GCC mechanisms provide a multilateral platform, bullet point 1 clarifies that GCC‑level agreements implicate all six members but do not bypass domestic processes; bullet point 0 also notes variable member enthusiasm. Therefore, decisions are not automatically binding across states without domestic ratification.",

The GCC deliberately maintains a denser, institutionalised set of security and economic instruments tailored to the Gulf’s strategic environment, and its reluctance to enlarge is rooted in preserving political‑institutional compatibility rather than avoiding duplication with the Arab League (bullet 6).

Egypt and Iraq do have strategic stakes in Gulf affairs (Egypt via Red Sea/Arab Sea approaches; Iraq via land border with Kuwait) and the GCC already uses flexible formats to engage geographically adjacent and non‑Gulf Arab states. The GCC’s non‑expansion is better explained by political/regime considerations than by simple lack of maritime adjacency (bullets 3 and 4).",

The GCC’s primary integrative factor is shared monarchical governance and comparable elite structures; the council’s deliberate policy privileges political similarity and security alignment over enlargement. Bringing in republics like Egypt and Iraq would introduce divergent political systems and popular politics, producing institutional and security frictions that the GCC has historically avoided (bullets 2 and 1). The GCC often engages these states through flexible formats (e.g., GCC+3) instead of full membership, which preserves internal homogeneity while enabling cooperation (bullet 6). The photograph of larger meetings (bullet 0) illustrates this preference for expanded engagement without formal enlargement.",

The council’s membership stability since 1981 stems chiefly from shared regime type and security alignment rather than concerns that new members are economically weaker. Moreover, the GCC has substantial financial mechanisms, and economic arguments have not driven the refusal to enlarge (bullet 2)."

The key factor underpinning the GCC’s denser institutionalisation is political homogeneity: all members are Arab monarchies with similar elite structures, which fosters trust and makes it practical to develop formalised security, economic and political instruments tailored to the Gulf’s unique strategic environment (bullet 2 and bullet 6). The GCC’s formation in 1981 and its stable membership reflect a deliberate policy choice to build a sub‑regional organisation with deeper integration than the broader Arab League (bullet 1 and bullet 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While the GCC is a sub‑regional body focused on the Gulf, its creation was not driven by geographic isolation from the Arab world. Many GCC members maintain active ties across the Arab League and beyond (bullet 6). Geographic factors (land borders and maritime adjacencies) shape strategic concerns, but institutional density is primarily a product of shared regime type (bullets 3 and 4 do not by themselves explain institutional depth).",

The Gulf states are actually highly economically interdependent in certain areas (energy markets, labour flows, investment) and have the fiscal capacity to institutionalise cooperation. The notion that institutionalisation compensates for weak market ties is not supported by the GCC’s record; instead, political similarity and security imperatives are central drivers (bullets 2 and 6).",

While external powers often engage with the GCC (as in GCC+3 meetings and U.S. participation, bullet 0 and 6), the GCC’s institutional development stems primarily from internal political alignment among monarchies and regional strategic needs rather than being created under direct external direction. External involvement supplements but does not explain the GCC’s denser institutionalisation (bullet 6)."

Land borders (and fixed links) exist between some members but are of limited relevance to a maritime incident; a coordinated regional approach is preferable (bullet 3 and 6).",

Given the centrality of chokepoints (Strait of Hormuz, Bab al‑Mandeb) and maritime adjacencies to Gulf security, coordinated naval measures and multilateral diplomacy—supported where necessary by external partners—best preserve cohesion and manage escalation (bullets 5 and 4)."

Bullet 2 underscores that defence, maritime security and counter‑terrorism partnerships with GCC states are mediated through head‑of‑state ties and ministerial channels and that bilateral collaborations matter for Indian naval planning.

Economic engagement is important, but assuming security “naturally follows” overlooks the explicit defence and maritime cooperation needs highlighted in Bullet 2 and the necessity of head‑of‑state level engagement noted in Bullets 3 and 4.
