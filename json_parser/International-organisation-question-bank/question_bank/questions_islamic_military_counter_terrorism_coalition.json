              "question": "The IMCTC lists a binary “Military role” indicator (Yes/blank) for members while its legal and operational instruments remain subject to interpretation and documentation. From a legal-policy standpoint, what is the most immediate implication for planners seeking to mount a coalition operation under the IMCTC?",

                "Delegate operational planning to UN or regional organisations because IMCTC lacks legitimacy for military operations.",

Although the IMCTC has a lead sponsor and political momentum (Saudi Arabia noted as lead sponsor in bullet 3), the binary ‘Yes’ does not legally substitute for consent on command, force posture or ROE (bullet 2). Relying solely on the lead sponsor risks legal incoherence and breaches of national restrictions.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Treating all ‘Yes’ entries as merely symbolic would foreclose the coalition’s operational utility even where substantive commitments exist (bullets 1 and 3). The better approach is to convert expressed willingness into documented legal/operational frameworks rather than abandoning joint action altogether.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While UN or regional endorsement can add legitimacy in some cases, it is not necessarily required nor the only practical route. The IMCTC is a distinct political‑military forum (bullet 0) and the primary deficiency is lack of internal operational documentation (bullet 0 and 2), which should be addressed directly rather than automatically deferring to other organisations.",
                "3": "Correct. The dataset and footnote α make clear that the binary military indicator only records willingness to provide assistance and does not specify scale, conditions, command or rules of engagement (bullets 1 and 2). Given that IMCTC’s legal and operational instruments are ‘subject to interpretation and further documentation’ (bullet 0), planners must secure detailed SOPs, ROE and command agreements to ensure lawful, coherent and accountable coalition operations."

The dataset does not show an automatic central command with binding authority over national forces—indeed, the absence of documented command arrangements is a key interpretive caution (bullet 2). The problem for fragile states is more about capacity and coherent national consent than formal subordination.",
                "1": "Incorrect. IMCTC’s initial exclusivity was to OIC members (bullet 0), but that is a membership criterion, not a legal prohibition on participation by states experiencing internal conflict. The limitation is practical capacity and authority, not formal legal exclusion.",
                "2": "Incorrect. There is no evidence in the dataset that IMCTC membership imposes a standing obligation to maintain expeditionary forces. Bullet 1 clarifies the table’s ‘Military role’ is binary and does not quantify scale or readiness.",
                "3": "Correct. Bullet 4 explicitly notes that membership includes states with ongoing internal conflicts (e.g., Libya, Somalia, Mali) whose domestic instability complicates outward military commitment. Footnote α and the membership table (bullets 1 and 3) show that ‘Yes’ denotes willingness but not capacity, command arrangements, or legal mandates—so fragmented authority and limited expeditionary capability are the most plausible constraints."

Bullet 0 and 4 show the IMCTC was framed within OIC membership (initially 34 OIC members) which provides a shared diplomatic/religious architecture that can ease political coordination (advantage).

The risk of sectarian rhetoric (Bullet 13) further suggests the coalition could remain largely symbolic unless structural reforms are made.",
