                "1": "Incorrect. Inviting Indian institutions to regional camps promotes collaboration and capacity-building (bullet 14) and strengthens institutional ties, but this measure is institutionally focused and less likely—on its own—to create a broad public-facing platform that projects influence across the region as effectively as a contest-based outreach (bullet 15).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Bilateral training programmes are valuable for capacity-building and bilateral goodwill (bullet 14) but tend to be country-by-country and may not scale network formation or project India’s influence region-wide as directly as a regionally linked contest would. They are more focused on capability transfer than large-scale regional socialisation (bullet 15).",
                "3": "Correct. Establishing parallel contests tied to diplomatic outreach most directly combines projection of influence and network formation. A contest functions as a visible public diplomacy instrument that socialises participants, builds cross-border networks, and projects educational leadership (bullet 15), while the explicit diplomatic linkage allows India to scale influence across multiple countries even without SEAMEO membership (bullet 14)."

Bullet 4 explicitly states that hand‑washing and tooth‑brushing cannot be made feasible or sustainable without basic sanitation works and reliable water access; if water is intermittent the physical precondition for those routines is absent, causing breakdown even when consumables and initial activities exist (bullets 2 and 3 explain the routines and interventions).",

Bullet 14 highlights that regional and multilateral partnerships exemplify soft‑power diplomacy and development cooperation that strengthen ties and create norms in neighbouring states. Bullet 16 adds that collaboration between regional organisations, bilateral partners and technical centres can deliver human‑security outcomes—pooling strengths to institutionalise practices.",

This aligns directly with bullet 16, which presents Fit For School as an instructive case showing the leakages and leverage points—funding streams, institutionalisation, monitoring—that determine whether interventions become sustainable public goods or remain pilots.
