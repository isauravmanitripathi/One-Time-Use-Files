It neglects the need for joint policy frameworks and regional standards (bullet point 2, Index 1) and ignores how ESCWA leverages multilateral cooperation (bullet point 6, Index 5).",
                "1": "Why option D is not appropriate as a sole response: Improving statistics is important (bullet point 5, Index 4) but delaying policy action until perfect data is available can allow the dispute to escalate. ESCWA typically combines statistical support with immediate policy dialogue and operational assistance (bullet point 2, Index 1); thus data improvement should accompany, not precede, mediation and capacity‑building.",
                "2": "Why option A is not the best: Producing regional standards leverages ESCWA’s normative role (see bullet point 2, Index 1) but alone it omits the operational follow‑through—technical assistance, capacity‑building and joint monitoring—that is necessary for implementation across borders (bullet point 5, Index 4). In a geopolitically sensitive subregion (bullet point 1, Index 0), standards without operational facilitation risk non‑compliance and limited conflict mitigation.",

Convening stakeholders also uses ESCWA’s role as a regional forum (bullet point 1, Index 0) and its ability to cooperate with regional organizations (bullet point 6, Index 5) to build consensus and joint management mechanisms, addressing both political and technical dimensions of a transboundary dispute."
