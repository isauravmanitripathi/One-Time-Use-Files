While the Board of Governors is the highest decision‑making body and can set broad policy (bullet 1 — index 1), it does not imply an immediate or automatic ability to alter voting shares; changing voting entitlements or capital structures would typically require formal procedures set out in the Articles of Agreement and political consensus, not simply a routine majority vote. Thus this option overstates the Board’s immediate corrective power.",

The official website and governance documents are authoritative sources for rules and updates (bullet 0 — index 0), but they do not autonomously change formal voting weights or appointment powers in reaction to contributions. Any adjustment to formal entitlements would have to follow the Articles of Agreement and the bank’s established amendment procedures rather than be dynamically altered via web updates.",
                "2": "Correct. The NDB’s governance design deliberately uses a rotational presidency among founding members and an informal allocation of the four Vice‑Presidential posts so that other founding members occupy executive positions when the President is from one founding member (bullets 3, 4 and 5 — indices 3, 4, 5). This institutional arrangement shares agenda‑setting power and reduces the prospect of permanent dominance, but it is primarily about parity of offices and influence rather than automatic changes to formal voting rights or capital‑based entitlements (bullet 0 and 2 — index 0 and 2 explain the role of governance documents and the Boards).",

Equal voting in the governors’ forum can promote formal equality (bullet 1 — index 1), but it is a procedural measure that may not address asymmetries in agenda control, executive representation, or informal influence.

This arrangement not only signals equality symbolically but also distributes agenda‑setting power and visible leadership roles, which can be politically more effective in demonstrating parity than purely procedural equal‑vote rules."
