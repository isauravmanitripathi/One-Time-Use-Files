Priority runs from the original filing: to claim priority in other member states, the applicant must file first in the country of the original filing and then claim that date elsewhere. Filing first in a target country and then filing in India would not make the subsequent Indian filing the original filing for priority purposes (see bullet point 4).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Public disclosure after filing is risky and does not substitute for filing in each jurisdiction. Disclosure can destroy novelty in some jurisdictions and does not trigger the Paris Convention’s priority protection; priority requires timely filings in other countries within the prescribed period (see bullet point 4 and implications for legal certainty in bullet point 5).",
                "2": "Incorrect. National treatment (a core Paris principle) requires equal legal treatment for foreign applicants in a member state but does not grant protection in a country without a local filing or recognized priority claim. Separate filings (or other treaty mechanisms) are still needed to obtain patents in each jurisdiction (see bullet points 4 and 5).",
                "3": "Correct. The Paris Convention establishes the right of priority, permitting an applicant who files in one Union member to claim that original filing date in other member countries within fixed priority periods — generally 12 months for patents (see bullet point 4). Using that right, the startup can stagger filings (reducing immediate costs) while preserving the earliest filing date for substantive examination and enforcement in each country (legal certainty referenced in bullet points 4 and 5)."

One of the Paris Convention’s two core principles is national treatment, which obliges contracting states to accord to nationals of other Union members the same protection it grants its own nationals, eliminating discriminatory barriers (see bullet point 4). That means a member cannot lawfully give domestic applicants materially better substantive rights solely on the basis of nationality.",

Because substantive rights and dispute resolution are governed by national law, the international registration may be vulnerable in designated jurisdictions. Practical mitigation includes filing transformation (where available) or national applications in concerned jurisdictions and contesting the revocation in India—this aligns with the need for coordinated management of national and international records (bullets 8 and 12).",

Bullet 0 indicates WIPO frames such outreach as technical assistance, while Bullet 1 suggests the strategic effects are subtle and better met by constructive alternatives rather than procedural obstruction.",
                "1": "Why option B is not the best: Strengthening India's domestic position is necessary but inadequate on its own. Bullet 5 explains that access to multilateral processes can be shaped by geopolitical leverage; without outward engagement India loses influence over regional administrative standards and networks that affect supply chains (Bullet 1).",
                "2": "Why option A is not the best: Encouraging rapid accession alone risks creating only a legal shell without the institutional capacity to benefit from treaty membership. Bullet 0 shows WIPO’s outreach included technical assistance and training, not merely accession; Bullet 1 indicates that harmonization can create administrative networks that advantage a rival, so accession without capacity‑building may be insufficient to counter the rival’s deeper commercial integration.",

Building partners’ capabilities to use PCT/Madrid/Hague and WIPO databases (Bullet 2) and linking IP policy to supply‑chain and technology‑security reduces asymmetric dependence and preserves maneuverability (Bullet 5)."

Chapter II provides an optional international preliminary examination that typically results in an IPER — a more detailed, authoritative opinion on patentability prior to national phase entry (bullet 6).

International publication of the PCT application and ISR normally occurs around 18 months from the priority date, making technical content publicly available (bullet 5).

                "0": "Correct. The cooperative’s claim stresses a causal connection between environment (flora, altitude) and product qualities, which aligns with the stricter Appellation of Origin standard (bullet 1). The Lisbon System provides international protection for AO (and, after the Geneva Act, GIs) via an international registration (bullet 0). However, because the 1958 Agreement and the 2015 Geneva Act coexist and contracting parties may be party to one or both, applicants must check which instrument applies to each target territory (bullet 3 and bullet 5 regarding procedural verification).",
                "1": "Incorrect. National trademarks serve different functions and obtaining multiple national trademarks is more costly and administratively burdensome compared with Lisbon international registration (bullet 5). Moreover, trademarks do not directly protect appellations of origin or geographical indications as such and may be less suitable to prevent misuse of a territorial name (bullet 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Historically, the Lisbon regime required that a name be protected or recognized in its country of origin before international registration (bullet 5). The Geneva Act modified and modernized aspects, but it did not universally and automatically eliminate all national conditions for every contracting party—applicants must verify current requirements for the jurisdictions of interest (bullet 5 and bullet 3).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While the Geneva Act explicitly broadened scope to include GIs (bullet 0 and 3), this option downplays the relevance of the strong environmental causation alleged. A GI typically fits products where reputation or cultural factors are central rather than a demonstrable causal link; here AO is a better fit (bullet 1 vs bullet 2)."

The PCT provides an efficient international filing route and useful information (international search report and optional Chapter II examination) but it does not itself grant patents; national/regional offices decide patentability in the national phase (bullet 1). For dual‑use or sensitive biotech, the prudent policy is to allow participation in WIPO systems to support commercialization while calibrating domestic implementation—screening, licensing, or conditional national phase entry—to protect security (bullet 6 and bullet 4). This aligns with the evolutionary governance trade‑offs of participating in treaties while preserving national controls (bullet 5)."

The GII’s methodology and publishing partnerships have evolved (including changes in partners such as academic sponsors) and such shifts can change indicator selection, weighting and presentation. These methodological changes can materially affect year‑to‑year comparability of ranks even if underlying national fundamentals are unchanged (bullet points 1 and 5).",

Appointment is made through a two‑stage process in which a Coordination Committee (a limited electoral forum) recommends a candidate and the General Assembly confirms (bul. 4). Therefore, influencing the selection by building a coalition within that smaller forum is an effective way to secure a leader who will prioritise access to medicines and align the Secretariat’s work accordingly (bul. 2, bul. 4, bul. 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While the General Assembly confirms appointments, it is not the primary body that selects the DG—recommendation comes from the Coordination Committee (bul. 4).

This option reflects the analysis that long tenures provide policy continuity (Bullet Point 1, Index 7) and that contested transitions can recalibrate priorities and redistribute political energy across issues (Bullet Point 1). The forward outlook stresses that leadership contests are strategic competitions requiring states to cultivate coalitions and participate in elections and deliberations (Bullet Point 3, Index 9), making contested moments opportunities for influence.",

This aligns with the cluster’s strategic implications: WIPO leadership that emphasises stringent enforcement without development-sensitive approaches can strain India's objectives regarding technology transfer, public-health access and strategic autonomy (Bullet Point 2, Index 8).
