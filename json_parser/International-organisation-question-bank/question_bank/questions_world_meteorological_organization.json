                "1": "Incorrect. Extremely long fixed terms emulate historical consolidation but reduce opportunities for renewal and may perpetuate representational imbalances. The WMO experience shows benefits from long tenures for standards but also highlights the need for mechanisms to promote innovation and diversity.",

Historical evidence: Davies (1956–1979) and Obasi (1984–2003) used extended tenures to consolidate standards and build programmes, suggesting a too‑short single term would hinder such efforts.",

Limiting the Secretary‑General to two terms (about 8–12 years) balances sustained leadership for substantive programmes (reflecting benefits seen under Davies and Obasi) with periodic infusion of new perspectives (addressing the transitional role seen under Wiin‑Nielsen). Institutionalizing deputy roles and knowledge management draws on Swoboda’s establishment of Secretariat practices to preserve continuity beyond any individual tenure."
