CGIAR affiliation (being a specialised research centre since 1986) enhanced the centre’s research credibility and global linkages (bullet 1), but that alone does not fully explain the later expansion in membership. Legal/political reorientation and mandate change are more directly tied to states deciding to join a continental body (bullet 0 and 2).",

While hosting a statutory headquarters in Abidjan anchors operations geographically (bullet 1), there is no strong reason to believe HQ location by itself produced the broad membership expansion; expansion is better explained by mandate and institutional identity changes (bullets 0 and 2)."

While funding can attract participation, the bullets highlight that WARDA was rebranded to AfricaRice to reflect an expanded continental focus (bullet 0) and membership increased to 28 states (bullet 2). That context makes the mandate change a more direct explanation than purely funding availability.",

The bullets indicate AfricaRice already combines intergovernmental African ownership and CGIAR technical affiliation (bullets 0 and 1), which are valuable for partners seeking established channels for research and uptake.",
                "1": "Correct. AfricaRice’s evolution from WARDA to a continental body and its expansion in membership (bullets 0 and 2) mean it is institutionally positioned to operate across many African states. Its status as a specialised research centre within the CGIAR system (bullet 1) brings technical credibility, networks, and capacity that can help scale and adapt innovations continent-wide — a strong strategic rationale for a development partner seeking broad impact.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While a sub-regional consortium may have advantages in focus and contextual depth, the bullets show AfricaRice was explicitly rebranded to serve a broader continental mandate (bullet 0) and has enlarged membership (bullet 2), and CGIAR affiliation (bullet 1) adds value; these are not simply diluting factors but can enable wider diffusion of results.",

The claim that a smaller consortium guarantees stronger policy uptake across all African states is logically inconsistent: a West African consortium cannot ensure uptake across all African states.

Statement A is correct because ministerial and technical representation links AfricaRice programming to national policies and facilitates uptake by national systems (bullet point 1).

Short-term projects exacerbate vulnerability to funding fluctuations (Bullet Point 3).",

This option balances stability and innovation: predictable core funding (greater member-state contributions and co-financing) reduces volatility and underpins long-term functions such as training, co-design and technology transfer (Bullet Point 1), while competitive grants sustain program diversity and innovation (Bullet Point 3). Sustained policy engagement is preserved through continued evidence-generation and dialogue (Bullet Point 2).",

                "1": "Incorrect. International partners may provide some buffers, but many seed systems and dissemination networks are local and require in-country capacity. Funding uncertainty can therefore severely affect domestic operations even if some external collaborations persist (bullet point Index 18).",

While operational activities like distribution are affected, the statement downplays how critical sustained funding is for multi-year breeding programs and staff retention. Breeding programs depend on continuity across seasons and generations, so funding shocks can disrupt core research activities (see bullet point Index 18).",

Reliance on commercial sales alone is unlikely to cover the sustained, upfront costs needed to maintain breeding pipelines and dissemination at scale (related to bullet point Index 18).",

Multi-year core funding aligns with the biological and institutional realities described in the bullet point: breeding needs predictable, long-term investment; staff retention requires job stability; and scaling dissemination and seed systems needs sustained coordination and resources (bullet point Index 18).",
