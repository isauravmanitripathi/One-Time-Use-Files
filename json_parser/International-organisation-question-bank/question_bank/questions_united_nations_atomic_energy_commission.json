The strategy of evenly distributing weapons under supervision contradicts UNAEC’s explicit disarmament aim to eliminate atomic weapons and other mass‑destruction-capable weapons from national armaments. The Commission sought elimination and safeguards, not managed proliferation (Bullet point 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While moral and ethical concerns were part of the post‑war discourse, UNAEC’s mandate went beyond moral suasion to include concrete technical governance mechanisms (information exchange, controls, safeguards and inspections). Relying only on moral suasion would ignore the legally and technically oriented tasks assigned (Bullet point 1).",
                "2": "Correct. This option encapsulates the two complementary strands in UNAEC’s mandate: technical measures (information exchange, safeguards, inspection arrangements) and political disarmament (measures to ensure atomic energy was used only for peaceful purposes). It reflects the Commission’s effort to pair transparency and technical oversight with political agreements to prevent use as instruments of mass destruction (Bullet points 0 and 1).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Direct UN administration of all atomic materials was not the practical or stated approach; UNAEC sought controls, safeguards and inspections while reconciling state sovereignty concerns, not wholesale UN takeover. The mandate emphasized proposals for controls and safeguards rather than immediate international ownership (Bullet points 0 and 1)."

                "0": "Incorrect. Scientific exchange can continue even with limited mutual trust; the bullet points show information exchange was a separate strand of UNAEC’s mandate. While trust facilitates exchange, the more direct problem from refusing inspections is verification failure (Bullet point 1).",
                "1": "Correct. Refusal to accept inspections directly undermines safeguards — the arrangements designed to detect violations and evasions and to protect complying states. UNAEC paired technical verification (inspections) with political measures to ensure peaceful use; without inspection access, the safeguards cannot function effectively (Bullet point 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While refusal to accept inspections complicates eventual elimination of weapons, elimination is a broader political objective; the immediate and most direct effect is on verification/safeguards. Elimination would be jeopardized secondarily but is not the immediate mechanism compromised (Bullet point 1).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Moral arguments were part of the post‑war context, but UNAEC explicitly included technical governance (information exchange, safeguards, inspections).

The record shows an emphasis on controls, inspections and disarmament proposals rather than immediate global administration (Bullet points 1 and 2).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While politics includes symbolic acts, the documented urgency — the Assembly’s instruction and UNAEC’s swift submissions — indicates substantive intent to produce actionable proposals (science exchange, controls, elimination, safeguards), not mere symbolism (Bullet point 2 and 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The urgency was about governance and non‑proliferation, not freezing technological development. There is no indication the aim was to lock in technical designs; rather it was to create institutional arrangements for peaceful use and prevention of weaponization (Bullet points 0 and 1).",

The rapid timetable reflects post‑war hopes and anxieties: policymakers wanted to act while the moment of cooperation after WWII still existed and before nuclear knowledge and capabilities spread or geopolitical rivalry (e.g., US‑Soviet tensions) made agreement impossible. The haste aimed to constrain the technology’s destructive potential through timely controls and safeguards (Bullet points 0 and 2)."

                "1": "Incorrect. Moral commitments and scientific exchanges are important but do not fulfill the UNAEC’s requirement for safeguards and inspections necessary to prevent covert weaponization. Technical verification mechanisms are central to the Commission’s mandate (Bullet points 0 and 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While national declarations and peer review can build transparency, they are insufficient to guarantee detection of evasions and thus do not fully protect complying states. UNAEC stressed inspections as a core safeguard, so absence of onsite verification weakens protection (Bullet point 1).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Allowing immediate unilateral withdrawal undermines the credibility and stability of a disarmament regime and would weaken protections for complying states by enabling easy exit after clandestine non‑compliance.

Bullet points emphasize political dimensions alongside technical ones, not unilateral scientific obstruction (Bullet points 0 and 1).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While timing was important (the Assembly urged quick action in 1946), the problem was not merely procedural speed. Rapid action reflected real anxiety, but even with more time, deep political divisions and security dilemmas between states would still have complicated consensus (Bullet point 2 and 1).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Funding constraints are secondary to the political issues of sovereignty, verification, and security guarantees. The core difficulty was reconciling technical verification with the political will of states to disarm — not simply financial capacity (Bullet points 0 and 1).",

This option synthesizes the core tension highlighted by the bullet points: UNAEC’s mandate blended technical governance (information exchange, safeguards, inspections) with political disarmament (elimination of weapons).
