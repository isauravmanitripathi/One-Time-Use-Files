This option recognises the trade‑offs discussed in the cluster: pooled commitments (state + central bank) are credible mechanisms for crisis prevention (Bullet Point 5) and the GAB provides an early example of this (Bullet Point 1). At the same time, elite groupings can shape international monetary stability and thereby affect the policy space of emerging economies (Bullet Point 5). The NAB’s expansion (Bullet Point 3) also shows the model’s evolution toward broader inclusion."

This option recognises the trade‑off implicit in the bullets: observers reduce information asymmetries and align choices with international norms via standardised frameworks (bullet point 3 and 4), but heavy reliance on those same frameworks can encourage convergence and reduce the exploration of innovative or divergent policy options (an unintended constraint on policy variety). This also ties to the limit that observer input is advisory—useful but not a substitute for diverse perspectives (bullet point 0 and 4)."
