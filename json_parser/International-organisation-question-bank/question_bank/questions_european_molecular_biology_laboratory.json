Bilateral MoUs can target specific collaborations and are less costly initially, but they lack the embedded preferential access across the organisation's sites, the broader training pipelines, and the network effects that membership modalities (even associate) provide (Index 7 and 10). They also do not scale as easily for national capacity-building goals.",
                "2": "Correct. Associate membership typically allows reduced financial/legal commitments while conferring many cooperative benefits — preferential access to facilities, training and fellowships — thus maximizing scientific returns for constrained budgets (bullet points Index 8 and 10). It also avoids the heavier governance obligations and long-term financial burden associated with full membership (Index 11), while still embedding the country in collaborative networks (Index 7).",

Full membership gives governance and agenda-setting influence (Index 11) but requires substantial and sustained political and financial commitments and potential domestic obligations to sustain participation (Index 7), making it ill-suited for the stated constrained-budget objective."
