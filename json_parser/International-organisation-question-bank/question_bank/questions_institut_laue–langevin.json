Peak flux does not automatically translate to better steady‑state resolution.",

Neutron reflectometry is excellent for depth profiles (thickness, roughness, scattering‑length density) of layered structures (bullet 4), but standard reflectometry primarily yields depth‑resolved (out‑of‑plane) information rather than lateral inhomogeneities and in‑plane correlations. Using thermal neutrons further reduces sensitivity to the large lateral length scales and slow dynamics that cold neutrons probe (bullet 2).",
