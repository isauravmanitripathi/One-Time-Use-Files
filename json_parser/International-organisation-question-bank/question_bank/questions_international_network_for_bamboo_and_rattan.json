Given that INBAR’s membership is broad (open to UN Member States and IGOs) and currently medium-sized (50 members) India has scope to lead regional work (bullets 0 and 1). The Council meets only biennially (bullet 2), so relying solely on it would leave long gaps for implementation oversight. The Board of Trustees meets annually and provides technical continuity and the ability to steer policy between Council sessions (bullet 3). The Director General is centralised in executive accountability and is both on the Board and head of the Secretariat (bullet 5), and the Executive Management handles programme delivery and member affairs (bullet 6). Therefore, engaging the Board plus sustained collaboration with the DG and Executive Management offers the most practical route to influence programme design, donor relations and implementation between Council sessions.",

Negotiating outside INBAR would limit access to institutional knowledge, donor relationships and the Secretariat’s implementation capacities (bullets 5 and 6), and could also alienate other Member States.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While the Council provides political oversight (bullets 2 and 4), it meets only every two years (bullet 2), which limits its utility for continuous programme leadership. Political leadership at Council sessions is important for high‑level mandates, but it does not provide the frequent technical or operational touchpoints needed for leading regional initiatives on an ongoing basis (bullet 3).",

Focusing only on the Host Country Affairs Directorate could help secure local pilots (bullet 6), but it neglects the need for broader coalition‑building and technical endorsement by the Board for scaling and for donor confidence.

                "1": "Incorrect. Although there are interconnections (for example, the DG’s dual role, bullet 5), INBAR’s design intentionally follows familiar multilateral norms (bullet 4) with relatively clear role demarcations: political oversight (Council), technical continuity (Board), and execution (Secretariat). The structure is meant to enable, not prevent, technical continuity and operational implementation.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The Secretariat does not independently overrule the Board or Council. The Director General centralises operational accountability (bullet 5) and links implementation to the Board by being a Board member, but this is designed to ensure coordination and accountability rather than unilateral policy setting (bullets 3 and 5).",

This option synthesises the governance pattern: the Council provides political oversight at the member‑state level and meets biennially (bullets 2 and 4), the Board of Trustees—composed of appointed experts—meets annually and provides technical continuity and interim oversight (bullet 3), and the Secretariat, led by a Director General who sits on the Board, is responsible for day‑to‑day management and implementation (bullets 5 and 6).

While alignment with UN processes improves access to development financing and political platforms, it does not guarantee financing — observer status and agreements open channels but do not guarantee funds. Also, such alignment does not inherently reduce the need for private sector partnerships; in fact INBAR’s cooperation with UNIDO and engagement with UNCTAD (bullets 5 and 6/Indices 5 and 6) are designed to strengthen private sector linkages.",

Aligning with global agendas (UN Decade — bullet 4/Index 4) could shift emphasis toward global priorities, yet INBAR’s strategy (bullet 0/Index 0) explicitly aims to elevate bamboo from local livelihood resource to global policy instrument. Trade‑offs exist, but they are programmatic and can be managed through country engagement and stakeholder inclusion.",

While INBAR’s embedding (bullet 0/Index 0) into the UN system increases technical credibility, policy influence and channels to financing, its observer statuses (e.g., UNGA — bullet 1/Index 1, ECOSOC — bullet 2/Index 2, UNCTAD — bullet 6/Index 6) are explicitly non‑voting. This means INBAR gains diplomatic access and agenda‑setting ability but lacks formal decision‑making authority within UN bodies — a fundamental institutional limitation when trying to secure binding policy outcomes or votes."
