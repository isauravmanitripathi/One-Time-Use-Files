Observer status is an established category but does not typically confer the extensive participatory rights of full members; moreover, the Movement tends to use dialogue partner/guest status as a flexible way to allow participation without full membership commitments.

Observers are not required to adopt NAM positions as members are, nor do they automatically receive privileged confidential status that binds them politically.

This option captures the core legal‑political nature of NAM observer status: it permits attendance at summits and meetings, access to documents, and the right to make statements and liaise informally while typically excluding voting rights and collective obligations (see bullets 0 and 1 on the category and privileges, and bullet 2 on typical limitations). It aligns with the state's goal of engagement without formal constraint (bullet 5 on India’s use of observer flexibility)."

Argentina — Latin American representation and evidence of NAM’s reach in the Americas, offering potential multilateral platforms for India‑Argentina engagement; 2. Armenia — post‑Soviet state indicating NAM associations beyond classic Cold‑War members and reflecting post‑1991 realignments; 3. Bosnia and Herzegovina — post‑Yugoslav Balkan state recalling the Yugoslav legacy within NAM and continuing successor‑state ties to Movement institutions; 4. Brazil — major Latin American power signifying NAM’s attraction to influential regional actors and multilateral convergence on development and South–South cooperation; 5. China (1992) — parenthetical year likely marks a formal change (e.g., increased engagement, observer status or an institutional link); China’s relationship to NAM is complex and represents a diplomatic variable India must manage; 6. Costa Rica — Central American state reinforcing NAM’s trans‑regional associations in Latin America; 7. Croatia — post‑Yugoslav state highlighting fragmentation of the Yugoslav NAM legacy into multiple successor‑state relationships; 8. El Salvador — Central American inclusion reinforcing regional diversity within NAM‑related lists; 9. Kazakhstan — Central Asian state with post‑Soviet foreign policy balancing, signaling NAM relevance in Central Asia pertinent to India’s interests in connectivity, energy, and diaspora; 10. Kyrgyzstan — Central Asian republic underscoring the Movement’s post‑Cold War geographic diffusion; 11. Mexico — major regional actor in North America/Latin America demonstrating NAM’s negotiated presence in hemispheric diplomacy; 12. Montenegro — small Balkan state reflecting further traces of Yugoslav successor states’ ties with NAM constructs; 13. Paraguay — Latin American presence consistent with the list’s regional cluster; 14. Russia (2021) — parenthetical year suggests a recent formal step in Russia’s relationship with NAM (e.g., observer accreditation, a specific communiqué or declaration), with implications for India’s triangular diplomacy involving Moscow and NAM members; 15. Serbia — especially significant because Josip Broz Tito’s Yugoslavia was a founding NAM pillar alongside India (Jawaharlal Nehru); Serbia’s inclusion carries symbolic and practical relevance for India’s historical NAM ties and contemporary bilateral relations; 16. Tajikistan — Central Asian entry reflecting NAM’s appeal or associative links in a region relevant to India’s security and connectivity concerns; 17. Ukraine — not typically regarded as a core NAM actor; its presence is atypical and likely reflects observer/guest interactions or particular historical episodes and requires documentary verification; 18.

                "2": "Correct. The bullet stresses NAM’s flexibility and low‑commitment nature — inviting guests broadens voices and expertise and functions as a platform for outreach and normative influence for India, without imposing binding obligations. This contrasts with formal alliances that typically involve legal, military, or long‑term commitments.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Guest invitations may aid diplomatic pressure or normative stances but do not in themselves create binding economic sanctions; such measures require separate legal/political mechanisms."

                "0": "Incorrect. This contradicts the bullet, which says the practice broadens voices and expertise and serves diplomatic/informational functions rather than excluding them.",
                "1": "Correct. The bullet clearly links the lack of a permanent guest category and event‑specific invitations to NAM’s ethos of flexibility and consensus, broadening voices and expertise while keeping formal decision‑making with members. It underscores a balance between outreach and low commitment.",

This option aligns with the bullet’s dual insight: NAM’s invitation practice is useful for outreach and normative influence but cannot substitute for formal security arrangements when hard guarantees are needed.
