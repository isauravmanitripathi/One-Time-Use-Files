While true (bullet 3 and 4) — operational emphasis on training and technical cooperation distinguishes it from pure charity — the question asks which founding feature most clearly exemplifies the design choice. The summit‑level founding (option A) speaks directly to the Plan’s political intent and institutional character.",

Soedjati Djiwandono, bullet 1; Boediono, bullet 4; Adenan, bullet 5; Ananda Krishnan, bullet 6), but a roster of notable alumni tends to spotlight exceptional cases while ignoring the broader distribution of outcomes among all scholars.
