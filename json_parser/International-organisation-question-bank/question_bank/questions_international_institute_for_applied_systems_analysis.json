Instituting transparent funding rules, independent peer review, and conflict-of-interest safeguards directly addresses the requirement in bullet 5 to maintain research independence while accommodating member support described in bullet 4. This approach preserves IIASA's transnational, interdisciplinary mission (bullet 0) and enables decision-relevant applied research.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While securing funds is important (bullet 4), accepting earmarked funds without governance increases risk of perceived or real national influence, undermining the institute's claim of research independence (bullet 5). Reputation alone is insufficient safeguard.",

Although diplomatic neutrality is part of IIASA’s founding ethos (bullet 0 and 2), the statement wrongly asserts that IIASA avoids modelling; in fact, systems modelling and scenario analysis are core methodological tools (bullet 4). Independent consultants may be neutral but often lack the long‑term interdisciplinary infrastructure IIASA provides.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While IIASA is located near Vienna and the Laxenburg campus has symbolic and practical value for collaboration (bullet 2), physical proximity does not confer legal authority. The institute’s influence stems from evidence, policy relevance and diplomacy rather than any automatic legal force.",

IIASA explicitly privileges policy‑orientation and interdisciplinary systems analysis over pursuing narrow disciplinary theoretical research (bullets 1 and 4). Deep single‑discipline work can be valuable technically but may not deliver the integrated, policy‑relevant outcomes needed for a transboundary problem.",

This option synthesizes the institute’s founding purpose as a diplomatic‑through‑science initiative to bring researchers from different political blocs together (bullet 0 and 2) and its institutional identity and methods: policy‑oriented, interdisciplinary teams using systems modelling and scenario analysis to address cross‑boundary problems (bullets 1, 3, 4). That combination makes an IIASA‑style institute especially suited to transboundary, politically sensitive environmental problems where producing actionable policy options under uncertainty is required."
