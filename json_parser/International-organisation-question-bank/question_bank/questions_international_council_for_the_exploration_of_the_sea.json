The bullet points note that early presidencies were long and irregular (notably 1920–1938) while from mid‑20th century onward terms become shorter and commonly three years (bullet point 4). This pattern is most plausibly explained by institutional professionalisation and the formalisation of governance norms (e.g., explicit term lengths, rotation schedules) that improve accountability and predictability — a common evolution as organisations mature (bullet point 2 places ICES among long‑lived organisations where such formalisation supports continuity).",
