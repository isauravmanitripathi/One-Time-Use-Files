There is no support for the claim that normative development was abandoned.",

Bullet 1 notes Diallo’s unusually long early tenure which likely provided continuity during the Convention’s formative years (organizational establishment and normative development). Bullet 6 describes the post‑2007 pattern of ~6‑year tenures aligned with UN senior appointment norms allowing leaders to implement multi‑year strategic plans — i.e., operationalization and implementation. Together these suggest a balance between early institution‑building and later programmatic leadership.",

Bullets 2–5 and 6 indicate post‑2007 leaders serve ~6‑year tenures and pursue medium‑term strategic agendas (e.g., operationalizing instruments, land degradation neutrality, finance mobilization). Engaging early in a leader’s term lets India align proposals with the incoming leader’s strategic priorities and with intersecting global agendas (Bullet 4 and 5 reference climate and restoration linkages), increasing uptake.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The bullets emphasize that the Secretariat plays an active role in operationalizing the Convention and mobilizing finance (Bullets 2–5). Dismissing engagement with the Secretariat ignores an important pathway for implementation support; timing engagement with leadership cycles is a better strategy.",

While state-level implementation is important, the bullet point emphasizes the need for institutional mechanisms and sustained political support—which typically require central coordination to ensure nationwide uptake, standards and international engagement.

The bullet point explicitly states that realizing the CST's potential requires sustained political support, targeted funding, institutional mechanisms for uptake and willingness to lead on scientific cooperation in the Global South.

The bullet point positions the CST as producing actionable science useful for combating desertification and drought, and highlights India's engagement as a way to support regional stability and scientific diplomacy.
