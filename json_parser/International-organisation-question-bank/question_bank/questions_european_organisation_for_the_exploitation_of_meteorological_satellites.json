While indigenous Cal/Val capability is important (and recommended), doing that prior to consulting mission documentation and key Cal/Val literature is inefficient and delays operational uptake. The recommended approach is to first understand the mission specifics and published cross‑calibration results and then invest in targeted Cal/Val infrastructure aligned to identified gaps.",

The bullet highlights the need to monitor Cal/Val reports and invest in indigenous Cal/Val infrastructure so countries can understand and correct uncertainties and biases. Without local Cal/Val, operational products are likely to retain higher uncertainty and potential biases, undermining decision‑making.",
