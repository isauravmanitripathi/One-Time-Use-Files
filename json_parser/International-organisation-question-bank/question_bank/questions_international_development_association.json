Bullet Point 7 emphasises that creditworthiness and market access are distinct from per capita income; Bullet Point 11 warns that the risk of graduation affects long‑run stability and policy space. Graduation can tighten fiscal options if concessional flows end before commercial sources are reliable.",

This aligns with Bullet Point 11, which advises analysts to treat access to concessional finance and the risk of graduation as factors affecting policy space and long‑run stability.

This option captures the nuanced reality: IDA targets core public goods (transport corridors can be included) and can use grants for humanitarian/global public goods where repayment capacity is absent. However, IDA’s performance-based allocation (CPIA) and assessments of repayment and implementation capacity shape the form and scale of assistance. In fragile, low-CPIA settings, IDA may favor grants or smaller, carefully structured interventions rather than large concessional credits — balancing development, fiscal sustainability, and institutional constraints (bullets 1, 2, 4 and 6)."
