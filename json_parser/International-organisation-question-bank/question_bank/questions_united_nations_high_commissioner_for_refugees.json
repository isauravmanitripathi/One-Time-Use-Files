The IRO had already lost political traction by the late 1940s, prompting the search for a continuing mechanism; member states did not intend to transfer responsibilities back to the IRO (bullet 0). The temporary UNHCR mandate was a compromise reflecting sovereignty concerns (bullet 2).",

The chapter cites UNHCR partnerships—most notably with FAO under SSAR in Tehran on 28 September 2016—as illustrative of the protection‑plus‑livelihoods approach that links humanitarian response to food security and local economies.
