                "1": "Correct. The ERC’s dual role both heads OCHA (operational and coordination responsibilities) and chairs the IASC (the primary forum for agreeing common approaches across UN agencies, I/NGOs and donors). That institutional positioning enables a senior UN humanitarian voice to shape policy, align agency approaches and advocate for pooled funding instruments—thereby influencing donor engagement. (See bullet points 0 and 1; leadership transitions like the appointment of a new ERC are material because priorities and management style shape inter‑agency relations and donor engagement—bullet 3.)",

The ERC’s policy voice and advocacy (including on pooled funding) materially affect inter‑agency coordination and donor responses, especially during leadership transitions (bullets 0, 1 and 3).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While any senior leader can influence agendas, the ERC’s role is designed to coordinate rather than to promote OCHA programmes. The IASC is a multi‑agency forum where consensus is sought; the ERC’s chairing role is meant to build common approaches, not to impose OCHA bias. This option overstates the conflict and ignores OCHA’s mandate to ensure predictable, principled action (bullet 0) and the IASC’s collective nature (bullet 1)."

                "1": "Incorrect. FTS is a transparency and tracking tool for funding flows (bullet 5); publishing funding information is not an effective mechanism to negotiate acceptance or the operational use of military assistance. This approach risks politicising transparency without addressing operational civil–military coordination or humanitarian access (bullets 4 and 6).",
                "2": "Incorrect. OCHA does not command or directly operationally deploy military assets; direct military operations remain under state and military command. While coordination with military actors is essential, OCHA’s strength lies in convening, setting humanitarian civil‑military parameters and coordinating civilian-led sectoral responses (see bullets 4 and 6). Directly coordinating military deployments risks blurring humanitarian neutrality and civilian primacy (bullet 0).",

Verifying and contextualising first prevents knee‑jerk punitive responses that would undermine impartial humanitarian action and create bad precedents.",
