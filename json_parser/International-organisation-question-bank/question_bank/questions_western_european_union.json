                "0": "Incorrect. Reallocation can reduce securitisation pressures, but it does not guarantee insulation; social/cultural issues can still become entangled with security politics depending on context (see bullets 7 and 8).",
                "1": "Correct. The historical lesson cautions that reallocating roles serves as strategic political signalling as well as administrative reform — such signals can be interpreted by other actors and affect regional perceptions and alignments (see bullet 10).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Specialisation tends to reduce but not necessarily eliminate duplication; coordination remains important and cannot be assumed unnecessary (see bullets 9 and 10).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While transaction costs may fall in targeted areas, the transfer is not guaranteed to reduce political attention for all policies and can have diplomatic side‑effects; the statement is overstated (contrasts with bullets 10 and 11)."
