Although agroforestry sequesters carbon in woody biomass and soils and yields co‑benefits (bullet point indexed 5), accurately quantifying soil carbon changes, ensuring permanence, and managing leakage are well‑known MRV challenges. These complexities affect the credibility of credits under REDD+ and NDC accounting and are a major obstacle to scaling finance.

Thus, complete independence and a single stable funding source are not guaranteed.",

The main governance risk is that international research agendas—even when well‑intentioned—may not fully capture local socio‑ecological complexities, cultural practices or governance conditions. This misalignment can produce maladaptation or ineffective policies. The ICRAF model’s strength lies in NARS partnerships and targeted research precisely to mitigate this risk, so India must ensure that partnerships are genuinely co‑designed and locally grounded.",

The bullet point suggests leveraging partnerships as a policy instrument rather than ceding sovereignty.",

While there is a risk of underinvestment in domestic capacity if partnerships are poorly structured, the ICRAF model explicitly emphasises systematic NARS partnerships and capacity building rather than outsourcing all research, so immediate wholesale loss of capacity is not the principal inherent risk."

A punitive, mandatory tree-planting approach with little capacity building is contrary to the bullet point’s emphasis on supportive measures—scientific input, technology transfer and extension capacity—to make agroforestry viable and effective for both ecosystem services and livelihoods.",

Relying solely on carbon credits overlooks the multimodal ecosystem benefits and institutional support the bullet point says ICRAF can help provide (technology transfer, extension capacity).

The bullet point focuses on capacity building and policy support rather than fiscal windfalls or automation-induced staffing changes.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The bullet point emphasizes supporting extension and evidence for policies, not promoting large-scale conversion to commercial plantations or causing smallholder displacement. ICRAF’s research and capacity building are intended to help sustainable, context-appropriate agroforestry, often benefiting smallholders rather than displacing them.",

The bullet point specifically notes ICRAF’s inputs are relevant to National Agroforestry Policy and state initiatives—so centralization and policy elimination are not plausible outcomes.",

Moreover, the bullet point focuses on ICRAF’s role in scientific inputs and evidence for policy instruments—MRV and technical design of carbon projects are better matches to that role than quick fixes to tenure.",

One of the main technical barriers to agroforestry carbon projects is developing MRV systems that accurately quantify carbon in heterogeneous, multipurpose systems.

The bullet point mentions ICRAF’s research offers scientific inputs relevant to national and state policies, supports technology transfer and capacity building for extension services, and provides evidence for instruments like PES and carbon finance.

A known risk of carbon-focused incentives is monoculture planting of species that maximize carbon but harm biodiversity and local livelihoods. ICRAF’s scientific inputs and extension-focused capacity building can guide the design of diversified systems that meet both carbon and socio-ecological objectives.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While market dynamics can change, the scenario of immediate universal adoption collapsing carbon markets is unlikely as a direct consequence of carbon finance. Moreover, ICRAF cannot guarantee carbon prices; its role is in evidence, MRV design and capacity building rather than market guarantees.",
