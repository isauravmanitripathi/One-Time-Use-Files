That informal, coalition‑style structure enabled it to grow well beyond the original 77 members while retaining the name as a historical memory (bullet 0). The absence of a treaty and formal legal personality made accession and issue‑based participation easier and less procedural.",

This option captures the G77's consistently articulated view that while all states have environmental obligations, developed countries bear greater historical responsibility and greater capacity to act (CBDR). The G77 stresses per‑capita and cumulative historical emissions as justification for differentiated treatment and links acceptance of commitments to assured finance and technology transfer (Bullets 4 and 5).",
