                "1": "Incorrect. Although Euratom is practically integrated with EU institutions, it retains its own treaty (Euratom Treaty, 1957) and separate legal personality. Therefore accession cannot simply follow standard EU accession procedures as if it were fully absorbed into EU law (see bullet points 1, 2 and 6).",

Euratom has a distinct treaty basis (bullet 2 and 6) and, despite deep institutional integration (bullet 2 and 3), changes in membership or external relations often require bespoke legal arrangements specific to Euratom rather than automatic coverage by changes in the EU treaties (bullet 6).",

While a full pooling of military capabilities would have been a logical way to centralize control, political realities—national strategic concerns, particularly over deterrence—and external actors (US/UK/Soviet reactions) prevented any treaty language that would have transferred control of weapons to a supranational body (bullets 2, 3 and 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. No Treaty of Rome instrument prohibited national nuclear programs or mandated disarmament. Instead, the Treaties created civil cooperation mechanisms while allowing national sovereignty over military capabilities to remain intact (bullets 1, 2 and 5).",
                "2": "Correct. The final design of Euratom reflected a compromise: it created supranational mechanisms for cooperation in civil nuclear research, fuel cycle development and resource-pooling, while member states retained sovereign control over weapons and military uses. This outcome follows from France's dual civilian and strategic aims and external pressures that made states reluctant to cede authority over sensitive military capabilities (see bullets 1, 2, 3 and 4 for France's aims and investments, and bullet 5 on external constraints and fears about rearmament).",
                "3": "Incorrect. The US and UK promoted intergovernmental technical forms (later seen in the NEA) to preserve state control, but Euratom itself was established as a community with supranational elements for civil nuclear matters. Thus describing Euratom as merely an intergovernmental technical agency is inaccurate (see bullet 4 on external preferences and bullet 1 on the creation of Euratom)."

                "1": "Correct. Euratom’s dual status — a distinct treaty-based organisation (de jure) but practically governed via many EU organs (de facto) — means the European Parliament’s powers over Euratom are more limited than in other EU policy areas, provoking concerns about transparency and democratic control (bullet points 1, 2 and 3 and explicitly 4).",

External actors and Soviet propaganda also constrained any move toward centralized military control (bullets 4 and 5).",

They also risk inefficiencies and political isolation that Euratom aimed to mitigate while still preserving sovereign control over military matters (bullets 2 and 4).",
                "2": "Correct. Euratom's origins show the rationale for pooling costly civilian investments (research, infrastructure, human capital) while carefully protecting national strategic prerogatives. The Louis Armand economic case made cooperation attractive for cost-sharing; the final institutional form maintained national control over weapons due to political sensitivities and external pressure. Hence a model that pools civilian resources but includes safeguards and explicit military exclusions best reflects those lessons (bullets 2, 3 and 4; also bullet 5 on constraints).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Outsourcing to an external ally sacrifices strategic autonomy and repeats the very dependence Euratom's principal architect (France) sought to avoid.
