Such linkages are strategic and negotiated rather than automatic safeguards against Chair capacity shortfalls (bullet points 5 and 6).",
                "1": "Correct. The Secretariat is administratively hosted at the Chair’s mission and executes Plenary mandates by drafting documents and coordinating communications (bullet points 3 and 4). Dependence on the Chair’s capacity causes fluctuations in operational capacity and risks continuity and institutional memory gaps (bullet point 6 and 7). Reduced Secretariat capacity therefore most directly leads to weaker drafting/coordination and the risk of fragmented or slower collective positions.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although PRs may take on greater burden, decentralization typically increases coordination burden and can slow operations rather than increase capacity—coordination challenges and heterogeneity among members already complicate unified action (bullet points 2, 4 and 6).",
                "3": "Incorrect. There is no institutional mechanism that automatically suspends AOSIS from UN processes due to a weak Chair; AOSIS operates as a coalition within the UN system and continues to function through its governance chain (bullet points 0 and 4)."

While tourism and fisheries are important to many SIDS economies, they do not confer the kind of global economic leverage needed to shape major multilateral climate outcomes. This distractor confuses small but critical economic sectors with international bargaining power—bullet points 1 and 6 show small, undiversified economies and negligible emissions, not economic leverage.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While some large states may engage bilaterally with SIDS for strategic reasons, AOSIS’s core effectiveness stems from its multilateral coalition-building, moral framing and technical coordination (bullet 0), not primarily from bilateral geopolitical patronage.",
                "2": "Incorrect. AOSIS members are not in a position to control UN voting outcomes collectively as a blocking minority in a way that makes them pivotal; their strength is normative and procedural within specific fora like UNFCCC, not procedural veto power. This conflates political mechanics of the UN with the coalition’s actual strategy (bullet 0).",
                "3": "Correct. AOSIS was established to consolidate and amplify the voices of small island and low‑lying coastal states (bullet 0). Its influence comes from coordinated diplomacy, pooling technical resources, and framing their plight as existential (bullet 4), which creates moral urgency and legitimate claims for differentiated treatment and finance (bullets 2 and 5).

                "2": "Correct. AOSIS’s three-tier governance places operational decision-making and negotiation management with the Plenary of Permanent Representatives between Heads meetings; the PRs are responsible for translating Heads guidance into negotiating mandates, approving draft statements and coordinating with other negotiating blocs (bullet points 1, 2 and 4). This makes the Plenary the appropriate mechanism to reconcile political ambition with pragmatic negotiability.",

It also complicates the institutional partnerships India is encouraged to build in Bullet 1, because short terms reduce the window for program development and implementation.",

                "1": "Correct — This option reflects the conclusion that AOSIS combined principled, legally informed advocacy with investments in people to magnify its voice, offering a modular template for India and middle powers: normative/legal expertise plus human capital development to shape norms and build partnerships (bullet 17). It also resonates with the policy recommendations to institutionalise advisory capacity and support SIDS capacity‑building (bullet 14).",
                "2": "Incorrect — The cluster emphasises normative and legal expertise allied with human capital development as the template (bullet 17), not a primary reliance on hard power; honours reflect principled advocacy rather than coercive capability.",
                "3": "Incorrect — Outsourcing expertise undermines institutionalised advisory capacity recommended for extending normative leadership (bullet 14). Awards do not negate the need for in‑house or mission‑level legal and technical capacity (bullet 14 and 16)."

                "0": "Correct — This answer captures the cluster’s balanced view: honours help in fundraising and partnership building (bullet 14) but are not comprehensive proof of impact (bullet 15). To convert accolades into real negotiation gains requires institutionalised legal and technical advisory capacity, investments in people with retention metrics, and rigorous monitoring/tracing of outcomes (bullets 14, 16, 17).",
                "1": "Incorrect — The cluster warns against assuming honours automatically yield normative leadership without institutional and evaluative follow‑through (bullets 15 and 16). Publicity without monitoring and advisory capacity is insufficient (bullet 14).",
                "2": "Incorrect — This is an overreaction. The cluster recognises honours as valuable indicators that can help attract co‑funding and deepen partnerships (bullet 14 and 17), even if they are not definitive proof of negotiation impact (bullet 15).",
                "3": "Incorrect — Co‑funding is an important outcome but does not by itself establish causal improvement in negotiation outcomes; the cluster calls for tracing causal chains and evaluating actual policy effects (bullet 16 and 15)."
