Thus, additional measures (multi‑year pledges, reserve funds, improved monitoring) remain necessary (bullet 13).",

From a strategic perspective focused on sustainability and national sovereignty, which choice is preferable and why?",
              "options": [
                "A is preferable because immediate adoption of established UNICRI frameworks guarantees rapid compliance with international norms and reduces domestic administrative burden.",

                "1": "Correct. The bullet advocates that while UNICRI’s partnership model aligns with India’s needs, benefits will be maximised only if engagement is calibrated — specifically by mapping roles, protecting policy autonomy and channeling international expertise into domestically owned reforms and capacity‑building. Co‑design (B) meets these criteria and supports sustainability.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The outcomes of A and B are not equivalent: A risks dependency and loss of domestic ownership while B fosters capacity and autonomy. The bullet implies a clear preference for calibrated engagement like B.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Rejecting external partnerships outright overlooks the bullet’s point that UNICRI’s specialised knowledge and multilateral cooperation are valuable; the recommendation is to engage but calibrate, not to isolate."

                "2": "Correct. The bullet specifies that benefits from UNICRI engagement will be maximised only if roles are mapped, policy autonomy is protected, and international expertise is channelled into domestically owned reforms and capacity‑building. The absence of these mechanisms directly signals misalignment.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The number of experts is a logistical matter; the bullet focuses on the structural conditions (role mapping, autonomy, domestic ownership) necessary to maximise benefits, not on headcount."
