                "2": "Incorrect. While per‑capita GDP avoids simple aggregation differences, it does not address the specific problem of fluctuating aggregate metrics caused by changing membership (Bullet 4) and can misrepresent the bloc's market size which is critical in trade negotiations (Bullets 0 and 5).",

Therefore, the company's recourse is not limited to awaiting national implementing legislation (Bullets 2,3).",
                "1": "Incorrect — While states retain security prerogatives, the Community's legalisation (direct applicability, supremacy and direct effect) reduces the margin for unfettered unilateral action. Security measures that violate Community norms can be challenged; national courts are not obliged to give absolute priority to national security claims over binding Community law (Bullets 3,4,5).",
                "2": "Incorrect — This reflects a common misconception. The Andean Community's direct effect doctrine empowers individuals and firms to invoke Community rights before national courts; they do not have to rely only on interstate enforcement. The AGHV complements this by adjudicating disputes and ensuring uniform interpretation (Bullets 2,3,6).",
                "3": "Correct — This option synthesizes the Community's supranational legal traits: directly applicable acts do not require transposition and can operate within domestic systems; legal supremacy means conflicting national measures should yield to Community norms; and direct effect allows private parties to invoke rights before national courts. The Andean Court of Justice (AGHV) exists to interpret Andean law and ensure uniform application, so national courts may refer questions or apply Community law directly (Bullets 1,2,3,6). The security context does not automatically negate these legal mechanisms; instead it becomes subject to legal review (Bullet 4)."

The Andean notes point to institutional fragility and political volatility as causes of reversal (bullet 0 and 3), so institutional strengthening is the opposite of the pattern observed in exits.",

Chile's 1976 and Venezuela's 2006 exits are cited as instances where domestic inflection points and political shifts precipitated withdrawal, demonstrating the centrality of domestic politics to regional durability (bullet 2 and 3)."

The core tradeoff illustrated by the Andean Community is between pooled sovereignty through supranational institutions and the economic gains of deeper integration (bullet 0). The creation of supranational bodies (for example the Andean Court of Justice) and efforts like a Common External Tariff were mechanisms to secure legal predictability and market access (bullets 2 and 5).

                "0": "Correct. Bullet 21 explicitly notes that hosting institutions projects soft power but must weigh centralisation costs. Centralisation can concentrate authority and resources, generate perceptions of bias, erode regional ownership, and make the hosted institution vulnerable to domestic political shifts — risks that require mitigation through inclusive governance arrangements and sensitivity to member-state concerns. Bullet 22 also implies the need to verify evolving competencies and political volatility.",

On the contrary, hosting can complement participation if governance and conflict-of-interest safeguards are designed appropriately. Bullet 21 recommends prioritising regional financial instruments alongside hosting, while bullet 22 warns about verifying institutional statutes and competencies beforehand.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Hosting does not automatically transfer supranational legal authority over trade and investment to the host country. Supranational competencies are defined by treaties and statutes (bullet 22); hosting is primarily about location and symbolic influence (bullet 21), not legal control.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Centralisation can sometimes improve coordination, but it does not eliminate the need for inter-ministerial coordination within India; indeed, engaging multi-layered regional bodies requires internal bureaucratic mechanisms (bullet 21). Assuming it removes the need for coordination ignores operational realities noted in bullets 21 and 23."

Exclusive reliance on ad hoc bilateral measures sacrifices the predictability, professional networks and material means that well-designed regional institutions provide (bullet 23).

This option aligns with the concluding synthesis (bullet 23) recommending deliberate institutional investments to gain predictability and capacity for transnational risk management, while respecting India's autonomy and pragmatic multilateralism.

Because seats, competencies and practices can change, primary-source verification is essential to avoid legal and operational surprises.",

This hybrid posture mirrors Sánchez’s final analytic judgement and practical checklist: cautious institutional strengthening, realistic sequencing, attention to distributive effects, and retention of diplomatic remedies and security carve-outs to protect essential autonomy (Bullets 16, 15, 14).",

                "3": "Incorrect. Maximal legalization neglects the chapter’s warning that deeper institutionalization can constrain political flexibility and strategic autonomy; it ignores the need for carve-outs and sequencing (Bullets 14 and 16)."
