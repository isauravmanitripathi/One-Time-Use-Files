                "1": "Incorrect. While host states retain certain legal powers, the CIP case shows that legal anchoring does not necessarily equate to complete political subordination. CIP maintained an international remit and integrated into CGIAR despite being created by Peruvian law (bullet 0 and 1).",
                "2": "Correct. The Peruvian decree creating CIP in 1971 legally embedded the center in Peruvian territory and law while not preventing CIP from joining CGIAR in 1972 and functioning as a globally oriented research center. This shows that domestic legal instruments can provide durability and a legitimate hosting framework while coexisting with outward‑looking international missions (bullet 0 and 1).",

                "1": "Why option D is incorrect: Short‑term food aid addresses immediate hunger but not long‑term resilience or poverty reduction, and mechanization may not be appropriate for steep, fragmented highland plots. CIP’s mission emphasizes sustained food security through crop science, resource management and value‑chain work (bullet 1) rather than one‑off aid or indiscriminate mechanization.",
                "2": "Why option A is incorrect: Large‑scale irrigation and blanket input subsidies target lowland, irrigated cereal systems more effectively. Highland marginal lands have biophysical constraints (slope, altitude, cooler temperatures) that limit cereal expansion. CIP’s historical orientation toward mountain/highland agro‑ecosystems (bullet 3) and its crop focus on potato/sweet potato (bullet 2) make irrigation‑centric cereal strategies a poor fit for sustainable resilience in these areas.",

Infrastructure lending can support agricultural systems but, without embedded research cooperation, it misses opportunities to transfer technical know-how, build institutional linkages, and create R&D pathways for Indian entities (bullets 11 and 12). It also does not directly address biosafety or IP frameworks (bullet 13).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Outsourcing to private multinationals can accelerate commercialization but raises concerns about equity, local capacity-building, and political backlash; it may also complicate IP and biosafety governance and undermine soft-power benefits derived from public-good research (bullets 11, 12 and 13).",
                "2": "Correct. Long-term, co-funded integrated partnerships reflect the CIP–ICIPE lesson that linking breeding with entomology and pest management yields greater impact (bullet 12). When combined with capacity-building and clear biosafety/IP/regulatory arrangements they serve as effective agricultural diplomacy (bullet 11), open opportunities for Indian research entities, and mitigate biosecurity and legal risks (bullet 13). Such partnerships are also visible institutional signals that can be tracked (bullet 14).",

One-off trainings and showcases generate short-term goodwill but lack the sustained institutional engagement needed to create research opportunities or systemic improvements in breeding, pest management and seed systems (bullets 12 and 14).
