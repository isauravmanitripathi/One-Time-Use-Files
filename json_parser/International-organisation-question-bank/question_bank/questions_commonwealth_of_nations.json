The Statute of Westminster (1931) provided the enabling framework, but it produced different effects depending on whether a dominion immediately adopted, internalised, or delayed adoption. Therefore, internal legal routes and later adoptions could produce materially different constitutional consequences (see Index 8, Index 12, Index 9).",

Domestic enactments that asserted sovereign functions did not tie authority more tightly to the UK Crown; often they did the opposite by internalising autonomy (Index 8). The notion that later adoptions somehow sever ties more completely ignores the variety of ways in which sovereignty could be asserted domestically or through formal adoption (Index 9, Index 10).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Later explicit adoption did not operate as a wholesale invalidation of prior domestic measures; nor did internalisation guarantee immutable international recognition against future constitutional change. The legal relationships were more complex and contingent upon domestic enactments and political choices (see Index 8 and Index 9).",
                "3": "Correct. South Africa’s approach in 1934 — asserting sovereignty by domestic statutes such as the Status of the Union Act and the Royal Executive Functions and Seals Act (Index 8) — is an example of internalising the Statute’s principles without a discrete adoption instrument. That domestic route can enable immediate assertion of control over constitutional arrangements and executive functions. By contrast, dominions that adopted the Statute later (e.g., New Zealand in 1947, per the timeline in Index 12) recognised legal equality but the timing delayed the full exercise of independent constitutional capacities. This explains how uneven adoption processes produced distinct legal legacies (Index 9) and contributed to divergent constitutional paths (Index 10)."

By contrast, a dominion that asserts sovereignty through domestic legislation (as South Africa did in 1934 with the Status of the Union Act and related Acts — Index 8) demonstrates how internal enactment can preserve or create the legal and institutional capacity for autonomous foreign policy and constitutional control over security institutions.

The blended option reflects the pragmatic governance logic in the cluster: cross‑appointments can supply expertise and perceived neutrality in the short term (bullet points 0 and 1) while time‑limited use coupled with capacity‑building addresses the trade‑offs of slowed indigenisation and accountability concerns (bullet point 2). Negotiating regional arrangements and democratically reviewing JCPC status align with motives of regional integration and legal autonomy (bullet point 4) and manage sovereignty signals (bullet point 5).",
                "1": "Incorrect. While recruiting Commonwealth judges addresses short‑term expertise (bullet points 0 and 1) and retaining JCPC appeals preserves an external check (bullet point 3), indefinitely postponing capacity building neglects long‑term sovereignty and indigenisation risks (bullet point 2 and interpretation in bullet point 5). It also risks political backlash.",

Immediate abolition of JCPC appeals and abrupt indigenisation may assert sovereignty (bullet point 6) but risks functional collapse or weakened rights protection if domestic capacity is insufficient (bullet point 3).

It avoids the structured benefits and checks provided by judicial institutions (bullet points 0, 3 and 4) and is not one of the mainstream options discussed in the cluster."

                "2": "Correct. Imposing temporary exchange controls and negotiating phased repayment protects scarce foreign reserves from sudden convertibility-driven drains (a key concern in the late 1940s) and preserves bargaining leverage.

The bullet point (14) explicitly attributes the gradual erosion of the sterling area in the 1950s–1960s to the twin forces of decolonisation and the UK's reorientation toward Europe.

Exhausted sterling balances reduced dependence on the UK as a guarantor of external liquidity, incentivizing newly independent states to diversify trade and financial partners.

The late-1940s tensions over sterling balances and subsequent spending by 1950 (bullet point 14) strengthened claims for economic autonomy and were intertwined with decolonisation dynamics.",

While some sterling was eventually used in different ways, there was no uniform or immediate blanket conversion into US dollars by the dominions; instead, the late-1940s debates and 1950 exhaustion of balances (bullet point 14) reflect complex policy choices rather than a single immediate dollar-conversion outcome.",

At the same time, interpretive signage, community programmes and oral‑history initiatives can openly address the ambivalences of imperial categorisation and local memory—acknowledging how an egalitarian aesthetic both honoured sacrifice and reflected bureaucratic imperial logics in places like India (bullet point 5). This approach balances conservation, legal/administrative realities (CWGC stewardship per bullet point 0 and site distribution in bullet point 1), and local contextualization.",

Asking the CWGC to abandon its identical‑marker policy misunderstands both the Commission’s founding rationale (equal recognition regardless of rank; bullet point 2) and the legal/organisational framework under which it operates (bullet point 0).

              "options": [
                "Because financial transfers from former imperial capitals are the primary driver of sports adoption in post‑colonial states, ensuring sustained international engagement and visibility.",

While financial support can help, the cluster emphasises institutional continuity rather than external subsidies as the main reason sports persist across the Commonwealth. It is the pre‑existing organisational templates and transnational networks (clubs, schools, coaching traditions) that matter most (bullet point 3/index 3 and bullet point 1/index 1), not primarily direct financial transfers from former imperial capitals.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Global sports media can amplify visibility but the cluster highlights that adoption and sustained influence depend on durable institutional ties (schools, governing bodies, rivalries) rather than immediate commercialisation. The Rwanda case (bullet point 0/index 0) and diffusion mechanisms (bullet point 3/index 3) show slower, institutional processes rather than instant commercial payoff.",
                "2": "Incorrect. This overstates the effect and misreads the evidence. The cluster describes adaptation and hybridisation of sports rather than the erasure of local identity. Sporting practices are repurposed for local meanings and national mythologies (bullet point 4/index 4), so sports more often coexist with local identities than simply replace them.",
                "3": "Correct. This option synthesises the cluster’s central insights: sports such as cricket were institutionalised under British rule through schools, clubs and governance (bullet point 3/index 3) and therefore created durable ‘supply chains’ (coaching, rule-books, governance). The Rwanda stadium example (bullet point 0/index 0) shows how those structures enable a country to adopt the sport in locally meaningful ways that also link it into Commonwealth networks—an effective mechanism of soft power (bullet point 1/index 1)."

This option combines two core cluster insights: the historical diffusion of sports via colonial institutions—schools, garrison towns, clubs and governance—created durable sports infrastructures (bullet point 3/index 3).

The cluster points out that the Anglophone southern and antipodean core (UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa) sustain frequent bilateral tours, coaching exchanges and exert shared governance influence within federations (bullet point 5/index 5).

The cluster indicates the opposite tendency: imported sports are often adapted and hybridised rather than simply erasing local forms (bullet point 0/index 0 and bullet point 3/index 3).

The claim that stadium investments are necessarily more cost-effective is an unsubstantiated positive assertion and overlooks the cluster’s caution that sports operate through institutional and cultural channels (bullet point 3/index 3 and bullet point 1/index 1). Cost‑effectiveness depends on objectives; the cluster suggests complexity rather than automatic efficiency.",
