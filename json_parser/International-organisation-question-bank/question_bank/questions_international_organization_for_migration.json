                "1": "Incorrect. Voluntary financing is the opposite of assessed contributions. Assessed contributions are predictable and negotiated at the UN level; voluntary financing increases donor discretion rather than channeling funds through assessed mechanisms.",

While governance bodies set strategic direction, IOM’s reliance on voluntary financing and its dispersed operational footprint mean that decisions must be backed by resources and field capacity.

Thus a combined approach is necessary to leverage strengths and manage political/financial dynamics.",

This mirrors the NGOs’ framing (Bullets 5 and 6): the ICCPR’s prohibition on arbitrary detention and rights to due process are robust human‑rights norms binding on states, and outsourcing operations does not remove state obligations to prevent arbitrary detention and ensure legal remedies (Bullet 3).

This integrated approach is most likely to close operational gaps identified in the controversy.",
