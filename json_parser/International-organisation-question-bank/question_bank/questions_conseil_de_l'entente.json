The Conseil’s original purpose combined political cooperation with concrete financial instruments and administrative continuity (bullet points 1–3).",
                "1": "Incorrect. An ad hoc consultative council sacrifices regular institutional coordination and the administrative capacity associated with a permanent Secretariat (bullet point 2). Relying on external donors also weakens intra-regional financial solidarity and control over assistance priorities, contrary to the Mutual Aid Fund's intent (bullet point 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Rotating Secretariats reduce continuity and institutional memory, undermining the administrative core needed for sustained coordination (contrasts with bullet point 2). Bilateral loans lack the pooling benefits and cross-subsidization that a mutual fund provides (bullet point 3), so they are less effective at smoothing asymmetries.",

This option combines the two institutional strengths emphasized in the cluster: a permanent Secretariat in a hub (bullet point 1 & 2) provides administrative continuity, coordination and logistical visibility, while a pooled Mutual Aid and Loan Guarantee Fund (bullet point 3) embodies financial solidarity and directly targets asymmetries by guaranteeing loans and providing assistance to poorer members."

                "0": "Incorrect. While economic change is possible, the Mutual Aid Fund’s purpose (bullet point 3) is to smooth asymmetries rather than trigger uncontrolled industrialization. Rapid industrialization is neither a direct nor the most salient risk arising specifically from a pooled loan guarantee mechanism.",
                "1": "Correct. A pooled financial instrument intended to assist poorer members (bullet point 3) can create leverage for wealthier members, especially if they contribute a larger share or control disbursement conditions. This can lead to political influence or conditionality, producing dependency or asymmetrical power relations—an important political-economic risk in compact groupings drawn from unequal post‑colonial economies (bullet point 0).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The existence of a Mutual Aid Fund does not automatically entail monetary union. The Conseil de l’Entente was a compact (bullet point 0) focused on cooperation and financial solidarity, not the imposition of a single currency—this option describes a different form of integration not implied by the Fund.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The Secretariat’s permanent presence in one city (bullet point 2) could generate competition to host institutions, but the Fund itself is not the primary driver of such rivalry.

Adding members like Togo (1966) bolstered the council’s regional legitimacy and made its core institutions—permanent Secretariat in Abidjan (bullet point 2) and the Mutual Aid and Loan Guarantee Fund (bullet point 3)—more effective instruments to manage asymmetries among newly independent states.",
                "2": "Incorrect. There is no indication that accession necessitated relocating the Secretariat; in fact, since 1966 the Secretariat was maintained in Abidjan (bullet point 2), which was chosen for continuity and logistical advantages.",
                "3": "Incorrect. The Conseil’s institutional framework focused on coordination and financial solidarity (bullet points 2 and 3) rather than immediate monetary unification.

The Conseil de l’Entente, formed by former colonies (bullet point 0), functioned as a compact for regional cooperation, preserving sovereignty while creating targeted pooled instruments like the Mutual Aid and Loan Guarantee Fund (bullet point 3) and maintaining an administrative Secretariat in Abidjan for coordination (bullet point 2).

Those characteristics explain its role as a formative early post‑colonial sub‑regional arrangement that institutionalized cooperation tailored to member capacities.",
