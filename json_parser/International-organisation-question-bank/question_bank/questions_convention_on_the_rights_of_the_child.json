The Vienna debates and subsequent practice show that many states accept broad universal principles (e.g., protection of children) but resist specific obligations — often through reservations, alternative standards or selective compliance (see bullets 0, 1, 4, 5). Material and political constraints make reservations and negotiated domestic adaptations a common outcome.",

The Committee on the Rights of the Child (General Comment No. 8) interprets Article 19 as obliging States to prohibit and eliminate corporal punishment in all settings, including the home (Index 9). Article 19’s protective and procedural safeguards also support measures to prevent violence and provide remedies (Index 7). India's existing school ban under the Right to Education demonstrates partial alignment but highlights the need for comprehensive legislative reform, funded child‑protection services, parental support and public education to ensure effective implementation (Indexes 12, 11, 13). A combination of prohibition, resources and education addresses both legal obligation and enforcement challenges (Indexes 9, 11, 13).",

While prohibiting corporal punishment in schools aligns with some domestic measures (Index 12), retaining a 'reasonable chastisement' defence for the home conflicts with the Committee’s interpretation that States should prohibit corporal punishment in all settings (Index 9). Relying solely on awareness campaigns does not satisfy the Committee’s call for legislative prohibition and robust child‑protection mechanisms (Indexes 9, 11).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Piecemeal judicial pronouncements and reliance on case law alone will not create the comprehensive framework called for by UNCRC implementation—States are obliged to review and amend legislation and build institutional capacity (Indexes 13, 11). Ad hoc judicial regulation is insufficient for uniform protection and enforcement (Indexes 7, 12).",

Non‑binding measures and voluntary programmes are important for cultural change and parenting support (Index 13), but the Committee’s guidance and the protective aims of Article 19 require legal prohibition and enforceable safeguards across settings (Indexes 9, 7).

Judicial interpretation can be important, but relying primarily on courts ignores the administrative work (training, monitoring, institutional redesign) needed to ensure public bodies actually change practice; Sweden found legislative status alone did not guarantee uniform application without harmonisation and capacity building (bullet point 22).",

Practical implementation (improved birth registration, names, documentation) directly reduces statelessness risk and facilitates access to services, including education (linking to Article 29’s goals — bullet 4).",

Article 7 implementation enhances legal identity that is a prerequisite for accessing education; meaningful change in educational access can occur even before full realization of Article 29 standards.
