Investment in cold chains, processing and market linkages coupled with nutrition education and inter-ministerial coordination aligns with the aquatic foods system perspective that foregrounds the full value chain (capture/farming → processing → distribution → consumption → waste), and treats food-systems management, climate resilience and nutrition as cross-cutting priorities (relates to bullet points 1, 3 and 4).",

Combining this with nutrition-sensitive aquaculture (species selection, processing and consumption pathways targeted at women and children) ensures those productivity gains translate into improved dietary quality and micronutrient intake (bullets 4,5).

Strengthening public extension and biosecurity systems addresses multiple systemic constraints simultaneously: it reduces ecological and disease risks (bullet 16), builds farmer capacity in husbandry and diagnostics (bullet 15, 17), and can be designed to prioritise equitable access for women and marginalized castes/tribes (bullet 18). Bullet 19 highlights that genetic and input improvements deliver public‑good returns only if accompanied by biosecurity, extension and inclusive policies, making this investment the most catalytic under budget constraints.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Development of affordable, nutritious feeds (bullet 17) is a high‑impact area and would raise productivity, but feed improvements alone cannot manage disease risks, guarantee market access, or ensure women and marginalized groups benefit (bullets 15, 16, 18).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Cold‑chain and transport subsidies (bullet 17) strengthen market linkage and reduce post‑harvest losses, but without upstream investments in biosecurity, extension and inclusive access, producers may be unable to supply reliably or may be excluded. Market infrastructure is necessary but insufficient as the single top priority."
