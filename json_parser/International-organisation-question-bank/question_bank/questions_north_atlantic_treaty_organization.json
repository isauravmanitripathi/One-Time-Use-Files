Avoiding Greenland’s institutions undermines the very governance sensitivities the Danish state must manage (bullet 5).",

This option reflects the pragmatic accommodation described: alliance operational needs (Thule’s critical missile‑warning and space capabilities) can prompt limited national exceptions, but because Greenland has substantial home‑rule and the arrangement is politically sensitive, any expansion should be negotiated with Greenlandic authorities, be transparent and time‑limited, and include parliamentary oversight—balancing alliance utility and domestic constitutional realities (bullets 3, 4 and 5).",

Although Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, unilaterally expanding US activities would risk severe political backlash and legal disputes because Pituffik/Thule’s arrangements are politically and legally sensitive due to Greenland’s substantial home‑rule (bullet 5). The Nordic precedent emphasizes calibrating accommodation to local governance realities (bullets 4 and 5).",

Although organisational reforms (e.g., the Defence Planning Committee’s disbandment in 2010) contextualised the return, France’s reintegration had substantive diplomatic and operational implications: it restored French influence within NATO decision‑making and reflected a concrete policy shift, not mere symbolism (bullet 7).",
                "2": "Correct. France’s trajectory is best read as pragmatic balancing: Gaullo‑Mitterrandism emphasized strategic autonomy, but by 2009 France judged that rejoining NATO’s integrated command would yield operational benefits while still retaining core national capabilities (e.g., its independent nuclear deterrent). This interpretation aligns with the description of long‑standing independence followed by a negotiated return under Sarkozy and organisational changes in NATO (bullets 6 and 7).",
