Appointment of an international supervisory body (or commissioner) contributed strongly to enforcement (bullet point 5 and 6) by blocking harmful government actions, but such a commission is an oversight tool; it does not itself constitute an account in which creditor funds are insulated from diversion as the segregated external loan account does.",

Pledging security revenues (customs, alcohol/tobacco monopolies) into a separate account was another important safeguard (bullet point 4 and 5), but it secures the repayment stream rather than directly holding and protecting the creditor funds themselves. It is complementary to, not a substitute for, segregated external loan accounts.",

The League loans used segregated external loan accounts specifically to hold creditor funds earmarked for deficit financing and to insulate those funds from diversion — an arrangement described as a core governance instrument (bullet point 3).

The EFO (Economic and Financial Organization) embodied multilateral normative/statistical work while the BIS focused on central-bank coordination and financial stability (bullet points 14 and 15). Historical evidence from the interwar period suggests these were complementary strands — standardized data and analytic benchmarks informed diagnosis and legitimacy (EFO), while the BIS provided technical coordination for liquidity and bank cooperation. Combining both approaches aligns with how interwar governance influenced exchange-rate policy and external liquidity as elements of national security thinking (14, 15, 16).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Unilateral protectionist measures were a common interwar response, but the coexistence of EFO and BIS represents institutionalized alternatives that influenced policy repertoires and legitimized multilateral surveillance and central-bank cooperation (14, 15, 17). The historical lesson is about how technical networks shaped acceptable policy responses, not that institutional engagement was ineffective (17, 19).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While multilateral benchmarks provided important diagnostic and normative guidance (14, 16), relying exclusively on them overlooks the BIS’s role in technical coordination and crisis management (15). The interwar record shows that norms alone were insufficient to deal with immediate liquidity needs and financial stability tasks, which central-bank cooperation addressed.",

Excluding multilateral statistics neglects the role of standardized data and analytic instruments in shaping perceptions of vulnerability and legitimizing policy choices (16, 19)."

Hence, India should build epistemic communities, support personnel diffusion, use academic/philanthropic channels, and combine technical work with political strategy to convert ideas into outcomes.",
