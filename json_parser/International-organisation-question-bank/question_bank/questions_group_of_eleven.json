This option identifies the core tradeoff: rescheduling reduces short‑term repayment pressure and is less costly for creditors’ balance sheets than forgiveness (bullet 3 and 4).

The case study indicates the Group of Eleven is a reported coalition making a joint request (bullet points 0 and 5) rather than an institutionalized rival to the G8. Its heterogeneous membership (bullets 1–3) and limited public facts (bullet 6) make immediate institution-building improbable.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Seeking unilateral political recognition on territorial disputes is too narrow and unlikely to explain a collective request to the G8 by a diverse group. The bullets indicate multiple possible substantive requests (bullet point 6) but do not suggest a shared territorial dispute across the membership (bullet points 1–3). A collective economic or governance-oriented appeal is more consistent with the group’s composition and the G8’s remit (bullet point 4).",

Sending a joint request to the G8 is best understood as an attempt by smaller and mid-sized states to engage directly with actors who control significant financial and political levers, thereby amplifying bargaining leverage (bullet point 5 and 6). The G8’s disproportionate influence over finance, security and global governance norms (bullet point 4) makes direct appeals a logical tactic for states that lack such influence individually (bullet points 1–3).",

The Group’s cross-regional composition (bullet points 2–3) can increase its normative legitimacy when addressing a forum like the G8 (bullet point 4), signaling a broad coalition of developing and middle-income states (bullet point 3).

Given the Group’s composition of lower-, middle- and upper-middle-income developing states across regions (bullets 1–3), and the G8’s disproportionate influence over finance and global governance (bullet point 4), coordinated demands for debt relief, concessional financing and climate finance are the most plausible and coherent.

While effective for targeted projects, they do not as clearly preserve the direct creditor–debtor servicing relationship in the way reprofiling does.",
                "1": "Why this is incorrect: Debt‑for‑development swaps (bullet 2) can strongly guarantee local spending on social programmes because cancellation is explicitly tied to spending commitments. However, they can alter the form of the creditor–debtor relationship (because part of the debt is cancelled) rather than preserve it. The question asks specifically about preserving the sovereign debt relationship while ensuring resource direction, which points to reprofiling rather than cancellation-based swaps.",
                "2": "Why this is incorrect: Outright unilateral debt cancellation severs parts of the creditor–debtor relationship (bullet 0) and, unless paired with conditions, does not by itself guarantee that the fiscal gains are channelled into social programmes. It therefore fails the question’s dual requirement to preserve the relationship while ensuring targeted spending.",
                "3": "Why this is correct: Reprofiling with conditionalities (bullet 2) keeps the debt on the books (albeit on different terms), so the formal creditor–debtor relationship is preserved, while the conditionalities are designed to ensure that the fiscal space created is channelled into agreed development expenditures. This instrument therefore balances continuity of debt relations (reprofiling) with targeted social outcomes (conditionalities), matching the requirement in the question."

                "1": "Why this is correct: Creditor‑funded trust funds (bullet 2) absorb portions of debt service and disburse grants externally. This can weaken domestic fiscal accountability, reduce the visible responsibility of debtor governments for social provisioning (bullet 3), and create incentives to rely on external funds rather than reforming domestic revenue or spending practices. That externalisation of responsibility is a clear pathway to moral hazard.",
