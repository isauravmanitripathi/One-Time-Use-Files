This aligns with Bullets 10 and 12: the MTCR functions through normative, practical controls and information‑sharing among members rather than a binding enforcement mechanism. Because adherents are not full members, they may not participate fully in confidence‑building or disclosure practices, limiting the regime’s capacity to compel action against them.",

This option synthesizes Bullet 11’s emphasis on geopolitical and symbolic significance of India’s accession—widening full membership beyond the Western supplier core—and notes the practical effects: international recognition of export‑control capabilities, easing defence cooperation under clarified arrangements, and obligations to maintain stringent controls. It also highlights the diplomatic signalling of integration into global security governance.",
