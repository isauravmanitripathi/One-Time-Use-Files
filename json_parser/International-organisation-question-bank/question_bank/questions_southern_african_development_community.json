The change was additive, not a replacement of priorities.",

Facilitating movement of people is one element of socio-economic integration (bullet 2 and 3), but the transition to SADC entailed comprehensive expansion across many policy areas including security and institutional strengthening (bullet 6), not a singular focus on migration.",
                "2": "Correct. The shift from SADCC to SADC (bullet 6) reflected the post-apartheid and post–Cold War environment that made it necessary to broaden the agenda beyond purely economic coordination to include political and security cooperation (bullets 1 and 3). The 1992 SADC Treaty created a wider institutional architecture to support this integration of development, security and governance roles.",

                "1": "Incorrect. Maritime access benefits coastal states, but a landlocked member cannot rely solely on island/coastal coalitions; it still needs overland corridors and customs harmonization to connect to ports.

The Organ on Politics, Defence and Security focuses on conflict prevention, mediation and security cooperation (bullet 4 and 5) but deploying forces as a prerequisite for infrastructure investment is disproportionate and politically sensitive. Sustainable reduction of trade costs typically requires combined infrastructure and customs measures coordinated through civilian institutions (bullets 5 and 6).",

A tiered approach combines the economies of scale from regional initiatives (FTAs, corridors) with targeted bilateral or subregional programs that account for differing needs, institutional capacities and policy priorities.

                "0": "Incorrect. Designing a uniform offer based on historical aggregates ignores the snapshot’s caution about uneven economic geography and institutional overlaps. Assuming harmonization will follow is optimistic and risks failed negotiations.",
                "1": "Incorrect. AU communiqués provide important political signals, but relying primarily on them and assuming rapid institutional implementation contradicts the snapshot’s advice to map overlaps and frictions and base decisions on recent, granular data.",
                "2": "Correct. This option operationalizes the chapter’s methodological takeaway: use up-to-date, country-level economic and demographic data and explicitly account for institutional overlaps and political frictions to craft differentiated, practicable offers and choose appropriate partners.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Updating GDP alone is insufficient. The snapshot emphasizes country-level granularity beyond aggregates and attention to institutional and political factors; applying a one-size-fits-all template remains risky."
