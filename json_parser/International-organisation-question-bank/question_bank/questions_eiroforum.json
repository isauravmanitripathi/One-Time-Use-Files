The primary financial impact is positive (cost savings); procurement centralisation typically fosters collaboration (by standardising equipment and interfaces) and can facilitate staff exchanges and harmonised user‑support rather than deteriorating collaboration (bullets 6 and 7).",

                "3": "Incorrect. Shared procurement tends to centralise and coordinate purchasing rather than increase individual administrative autonomy. It usually reduces supplier fragmentation instead of diversifying suppliers, because larger, coordinated tenders favor specific suppliers able to meet scale and interoperability requirements (bullet 6)."

Exclusive control and commercialisation may yield short‑term national gains but runs counter to EIROforum’s emphasis on multinational access, shared use, and reduction of duplication.
