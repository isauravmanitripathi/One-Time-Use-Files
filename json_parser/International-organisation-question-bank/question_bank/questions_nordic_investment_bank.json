Blended finance aligns with the NIB-style hybrid mandate (bullet point 1 and 2) by combining public-policy objectives (infrastructure, resilience) with market discipline. Public credit enhancement mitigates political/fiscal risks (bullet point 2 and 3), while market-rate tranches preserve credit discipline and attract private capital.

This option aligns with the cluster’s mapping: connectivity (transport corridors), energy systems (grids and renewables), industrial capacity (industrial parks), and fiscal resilience/public utilities (capitalising utilities and buffers) — all tangible assets underlying national security (Bullet 2).
