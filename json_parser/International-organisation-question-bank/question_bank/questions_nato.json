While Iraq did not directly attack NATO territory, the salient reason for not invoking Article 5 was political: NATO sought to reassure Turkey and deter spillover without converting the situation into a collective‑defense war.

This is reversed: NATO does not necessarily have binding global obligations for collective defense beyond its Article 6 scope, and Berlin Plus does not oblige NATO to act whenever EU territories are attacked—it provides arrangements enabling the EU to use NATO assets under specific conditions (bullet points 4 and 5).",
                "3": "Correct. The Lisbon Treaty’s Article 42(7 imposes an obligation of aid and assistance on EU members that applies globally to specified territories, whereas NATO’s Article 6 historically limited collective defense geographically (to areas north of the Tropic of Cancer). This creates a ‘double framework’ for states that are both EU members and NATO allies, meaning EU obligations may exist where NATO’s collective‑defense guarantee does not automatically apply. Berlin Plus provides a formalized mechanism for the EU to employ NATO assets and capabilities for EU‑led crisis management when NATO elects not to act (bullet points 4 and 5)."

                "The coalition commander will simply reallocate tasks to nations without caveats, eliminating any operational impact from the restrictive caveats.",
                "The absence of liaison authority will have minimal effect because commanders can invoke coalition standing orders to override national caveats in operational settings.",
                "Operational cohesion and tempo will degrade due to mismatched capabilities and task refusals, increasing the need for diplomatic resolution and tailored tasking.",

                "0": "Incorrect. While reallocation is a possible mitigation, it assumes sufficient uncaveated forces exist and ignores the operational cost and feasibility limits. Bullet 1 stresses early mapping of caveats and liaison to avoid such brittle ad hoc solutions.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Commanders cannot unilaterally override national caveats; the alliance’s intergovernmental character means national legal limits persist (Bullet 3). Standing coalition orders rarely remove the need to negotiate national constraints.",
                "2": "Correct. The cluster indicates that caveats and the lack of liaison/negotiating authority are central operational facts that shape what commanders can command; heavy caveats without negotiation mechanisms reduce cohesion and tempo and necessitate diplomatic/political engagement to resolve conflicts (Bullets 1 and 3).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Restrictive caveats increase legal and operational complexity, not certainty for commanders; they limit what tasks forces can lawfully undertake. The cluster recommends harmonising ROE and anticipating operational costs (Bullets 1 and 2)."

                "0": "Incorrect. Accepting multinational ROE as domestically binding risks contravening domestic constitutional and legal obligations. Bullet 2 cautions against diluting national legal responsibilities and advocates harmonisation without surrendering legal control.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Avoiding formal liaison may seem to preserve flexibility but will increase friction and unpredictability; the cluster recommends proactive liaison structures to negotiate caveats and tasks (Bullet 1 and 2).",
                "2": "Correct. This option aligns with the cluster’s recommendations for non‑NATO states: preserve national legal controls through explicit conditions, anticipate caveats and their costs, invest in liaison mechanisms with negotiating/blocking authority, and harmonise ROE/LOAC while protecting constitutional obligations (Bullet 2). It balances operational contribution with preservation of sovereignty and legal compliance (Bullets 1 and 3).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Delegating disciplinary and criminal jurisdiction to a coalition undermines national sovereignty and contradicts the cluster’s clear point that enforcement of discipline and criminal jurisdiction remains a national matter (Bullet 3)."
