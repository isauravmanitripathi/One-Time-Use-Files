                "1": "Incorrect. The WTO is a separate legal regime; while some claims might overlap, the EPA contains its own dispute settlement provisions and invoking the WTO instead would be procedurally complex and unlikely to be the most direct or effective initial strategy to manage EPA-related ECJ jurisdictional exposure.",

The Revised Treaty (2001) establishing the CSME introduced concrete commitments for free movement, common policies and institutional reforms — deepening integration and placing new legal and policy obligations on states.

A tiered approach balances inclusivity (formal recognition) with pragmatism (focus resources on major instruments), and the addition of drafting and interpretative rules addresses the legal complexities and budgetary implications identified in the linguistic evolution and administrative effects (bullet points 3, 4 and 5).

This option reflects a calibrated approach that reconciles sovereignty concerns with collective action: by limiting transfers to clearly defined functional areas (trade facilitation, health emergency coordination, dispute settlement) the state gains tangible benefits of deeper integration while preserving core sovereignty. Sunset clauses and periodic reviews provide political reassurance and institutional flexibility—addressing the dilemmas noted in the chapter about reconciling sovereignty with collective action and the need for institutional innovation (CSME, CCJ) while managing administrative and legal pluralism.",

Using only per capita income risks misclassification of countries that are small, highly vulnerable, or have limited administrative capacity (e.g., small island states). The bullet points list LDCs and MDCs but do not state criteria — highlighting the danger that income alone ignores size, vulnerability, and structural constraints, leading to misallocated support and inappropriate policy prescriptions (connects to Bullets 1 and 2 / Indices 8 and 9).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Income classification alone does not automatically reduce migration pressures. Migration is driven by labour markets, historical mobility, family ties and irregular flows (see migration overview), so this option overstates the effect of income categorization (contradicts Bullet 3 / Index 10 and diaspora bullets).",
                "2": "Incorrect. While income per capita is objective, it is insufficient alone to capture multidimensional development needs (e.g., vulnerability to disasters, structural constraints).

Also, receiving 63 entries (bullet 1) signals substantial, not insufficient, regional artistic engagement; therefore the inference that the region lacks talent is unfounded.",

The premise that the contest was merely ceremonial contradicts the stated intent: CARICOM launched the competition as a deliberate cultural‑diplomacy and soft‑power initiative to reinforce identity and legitimacy (bullet 0). Also, endorsing one song without transparent or perceived‑legitimate selection could actually undermine, not automatically consolidate, regional legitimacy (bullets 2 and 3).",

This option recognizes the core strategic rationale set out in the case: using an anthem as cultural diplomacy to reinforce collective identity, visibility and political legitimacy (bullet 0). It also correctly identifies an institutional limitation: although the competition received substantial engagement (63 entries — bullet 1), the public was not recorded as a formal part of the selection mechanism and judges were nominated by member states alongside the CARICOM Secretariat (bullet 2 and 3). Those features can create perceptions that the outcome lacks broad popular endorsement, even if artistically strong.",

Moreover, 63 submissions (bullet 1) indicate meaningful engagement irrespective of award amounts."

A mixed approach balancing transparency and public participation is preferable.",
                "1": "Correct. The concrete governance risk is a perceived lack of transparency and limited popular legitimacy because the record does not show the public as a formal part of the selection process despite broad regional engagement (bullets 1 and 2). The best reform preserves artistic standards (retaining expert judges) while increasing legitimacy — publishing criteria and scores and adding a formal public‑vote or feedback loop would mitigate public perception problems without discarding expert assessment.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Sixty‑three entries (bullet 1) is substantial regional engagement and does not indicate poor artistic quality; the problem described in the case is not quantity but the selection mechanism and public involvement. Increasing prize money could attract more entries but does not directly address transparency or legitimacy concerns (bullets 1, 2, 3).",

Centralizing nomination and judging within the Secretariat would likely worsen perceptions of Secretariat/state dominance (bullet 2 notes both member states and the Secretariat were involved in nominations).
