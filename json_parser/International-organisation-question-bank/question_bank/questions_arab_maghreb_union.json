It represents a gradualist, economy‑first approach rather than the instant political unification the hypothetical state seeks.",

The Union of African States (e.g., Ghana–Guinea) was an attempt at concrete political union between specific states, but it was limited in scope and more of a bilateral/experimental union rather than a broad ideological call for immediate continent‑wide federation. Thus it is less representative of a general movement for immediate pan‑African federation than the Casablanca Group."

                "0": "Incorrect — The AMU history contradicts the notion of guaranteed short-term success. Attempts at mediated solutions (e.g., UN processes mentioned in bullet 11) did not quickly translate into sustained institutional reform; the union remained paralysed because underlying rivalries and enforcement weaknesses persisted (bullet 10).",
                "1": "Correct — This aligns with the cluster: third-party mediation has limited effectiveness unless it is paired with measures that build reciprocity (technical cooperation) and strengthen institutional resilience to political shocks. The AMU’s experience shows external mediation without internal confidence-building and enforcement mechanisms is unlikely to produce durable integration (bullets 10 and 11).",
                "2": "Incorrect — While mediators can help, the AMU example (bullet 11 references UN involvement, e.g., Baker Plan II) shows that neutrality and external authority alone did not resolve the paralysis. Bullet 10 underscores that weak enforcement and deep bilateral rivalries can blunt the impact of mediation.",
                "3": "Incorrect — Labeling all external mediation as invariably counterproductive overstates the case. The cluster acknowledges external actors (UN, AU, EU — bullet 11) as actors in the process; the problem was that external efforts did not sufficiently address bilateral rivalries and weak enforcement (bullet 10), not that mediation is always harmful."
