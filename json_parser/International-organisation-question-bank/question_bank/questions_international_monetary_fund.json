Financing fiscal expansion with central‑bank credit increases the money supply and domestic credit—precisely what the monetary approach warns against (Bullet point 4).

Income redistribution and wage controls are distributional tools and, without addressing money growth or fiscal financing, can worsen inflationary pressure; increasing central‑bank lending contradicts the monetary‑approach prescription to limit domestic credit (Bullet point 4) and undermines program credibility (Bullet point 0).",

Bullets 2–6 show continuity in nationality (U.S.) and the predominance of technical/state-economics backgrounds (banker, Treasury official, diplomat with finance experience, economists and senior civil servants).

The chapter cautions that conditionality perceived to undermine social stability or democratic agency can be read through a security lens, with consequences for internal cohesion, state legitimacy, and external alignments—governments may face reputational and political costs that push them toward alternative partners or nationalist postures (Bullets 6 and 7).",
