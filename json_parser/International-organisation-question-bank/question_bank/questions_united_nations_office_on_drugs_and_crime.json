Vienna addresses are instruments for both technical engagement and diplomatic signalling; omitting normative language reduces domestic and international political gains.",

                "3": "Incorrect: seeking exemptions or conditional partnerships publicly risks undermining India's credibility on compliance and can backfire diplomatically. This is inconsistent with building legitimacy through multilateral endorsement and technical integration (bullet point 8), and it politicises what should be technical norm‑shaping (bullet point 9)."

Harsher penalties focus on punitive deterrence and reflect a security-only framing, whereas the WDR encourages alignment of domestic responses with international best practice that balances health and governance concerns (bullets 0 and 6). Evidence and modelling (bullets 4 and 5) often show that punishment-alone strategies do not reduce harms from potent synthetics (bullet 2).",

Sole reliance on military-style supply suppression ignores the WDR's focus on mapping trends, data triangulation and informing public-health responses (bullets 1, 4, 5). Such a narrow approach can miss hidden markets (bullet 5) and may not address overdoses caused by potent synthetics (bullet 2).",

Public education may be part of a response but is insufficient alone.",

This option synthesises key points: initiation of drug use in adolescence (bullet 5) means early interventions can reduce lifetime risk behaviours, and outbreaks among young, mobile or marginalised cohorts can undermine public trust and stress health systems (bullet 5).
