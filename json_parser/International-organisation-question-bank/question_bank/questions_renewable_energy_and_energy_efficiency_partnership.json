                "Engagement offers pathways to strengthen energy security, accelerate clean energy deployment and influence standards, but requires careful management to ensure alignment with strategic priorities and measurable contributions.",
                "Engagement will automatically and unambiguously strengthen India’s energy security because more partners mean more resources.",
                "Engagement undermines national sovereignty and therefore India should avoid participation in such multistakeholder platforms.",

                "0": "Correct. This option reflects the nuanced conclusion in bullet 13—REEEP’s architecture offers pathways to strengthen energy security and influence standards, but heterogeneity necessitates careful management—and ties back to bullet 10’s emphasis on preserving policy autonomy.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Bullet 13 cautions that while engagement offers opportunities, heterogeneity and scale require careful management; benefits are not automatic and depend on alignment with national objectives (bullet 10).",
                "2": "Incorrect. The bullet points argue against outright avoidance; instead they recommend internal coordination and evaluation to preserve autonomy while engaging (bullets 10 and 12).",
                "3": "Incorrect. While commercial interests are part of the multistakeholder mix (bullet 13), the platform also provides normative and technical assistance; blanket limitation would forgo benefits. The recommendation is management and alignment, not exclusion."

                "1": "Correct. Bullet 12 recommends examining REEEP’s internal governance and coordination mechanisms—how roles are allocated, disputes managed, and priorities set—to determine fit with India’s inter-ministerial processes. Requesting governance documents and project dossiers for India-related initiatives directly addresses transparency and accountability needs.",
