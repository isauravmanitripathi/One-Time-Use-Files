The process preserves an annual rhythm but deliberately keeps the capacity for extraordinary sessions to allow rapid political responses (bullets 3 and 4). Historically, extraordinary summitry (e.g., Skopje 25 Oct 2000) demonstrates this flexibility; delegating technical work to FMs while heads provide political endorsement aligns with bullet 5’s principle that ministerial groundwork precedes summitry.",

                "0": "Incorrect. A permanent centralized body could increase responsiveness but risks reducing member ownership and could be politically unacceptable in fraught regions. SEECP’s model uses distributed responsibility (rotated ownership) rather than centralization.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While predictability is valuable, forbidding extraordinary meetings undermines responsiveness. SEECP’s lesson is the need for both routine and capacity to respond ad hoc, not exclusivity of one over the other.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Relying solely on informal ad hoc networks sacrifices the benefits of regular institutional interaction—continuity, agenda-setting, and trust-building—that the SEECP’s ministerial foundations provide.",
                "3": "Correct. The SEECP exemplifies a balance between ritualized regularity (regular ministerial and head-of-state tracks) and ad hoc responsiveness (extraordinary sessions, mechanisms for partial participation). A regular calendar fosters predictability and institutional memory, while rules for extraordinary sessions and flexible participation allow timely responses to crises."

              "explanations": {
                "0": "Incorrect. Rotated ownership and mechanisms for partial participation are designed to manage disagreement, but they do not eliminate diplomatic standoffs or force full consensus. They facilitate continued engagement despite disputes, but do not compel unanimity.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Crisis-resilient modalities like virtual meetings help continuity but do not automatically create binding legal obligations. They are operational adaptations; transforming informal practices into binding law requires separate legal processes which SEECP does not primarily exemplify.",
                "2": "Correct. While the SEECP’s adaptability (rotated ownership, partial participation, crisis-resilient modalities) enhances durability and inclusiveness, it can also diffuse responsibility for implementation and produce uneven follow-through. With no permanent dominant actor or centralized enforcement, accountability may be fragmented—an acknowledged trade‑off in flexible regional formats.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Flexibility and decentralized ownership do not guarantee centralized enforcement; on the contrary, they often reduce central enforcement capacity. SEECP’s strengths are legitimacy and adaptability, not centralized enforcement across members."
