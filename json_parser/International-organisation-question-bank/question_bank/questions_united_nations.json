Colonial and protectorate territories were represented as parts of colonial empires at the UN’s founding (bullet point 4), but new states could not credibly claim representation on behalf of colonial possessions of other powers.

Although the Security Council is central for collective security (bullet point 5), its permanent membership and veto (bullet point 5 & 6) made it difficult for small or new states to secure actions against the wishes of major powers. Relying primarily on the Council risks marginalisation when great‑power interests conflict.",

The Charter enshrined a broad institutional remit (peace and security, friendly relations, human rights, economic and social cooperation) and created multiple forums beyond the Security Council (bullet point 5 & 6). Early membership and maps reflected colonial legacies (bullet point 4), and the Security Council’s structure—with permanent seats and veto—meant great‑power agreement was a precondition for decisive action (bullet point 5 & 6). Newly independent states historically found greater scope to shape outcomes through the General Assembly and specialised agencies, building moral and numerical majorities and addressing economic/humanitarian issues where the veto was less disabling."

The final arrangement did not mirror the Four Policemen literally: while the idea influenced major‑power privilege, France—initially sidelined—was subsequently secured a permanent seat through diplomacy (bullet 11). Also, the presence of five permanent members (including France) and the inclusion of China diverged from an exclusive four‑policeman model.",

Upgrading a non‑member’s status typically reshapes diplomatic space and legal argumentation—enabling broader participation in General Assembly debates and some UN activities and increasing symbolic and normative leverage—while leaving Security Council prerogatives and vetoes unchanged (Index 7 and Index 11). This makes such upgrades strategically useful for diplomatic influence even without hard security impacts (Index 10).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Observer upgrades do not confer full membership rights, and therefore do not include participation in Security Council votes or automatic access to all UN funds and programmes. Full membership requires Security Council recommendation and General Assembly admission under the Charter (Index 7 and Index 11).",
                "2": "Incorrect. An upgrade of observer status (e.g., Palestine’s 2012 upgrade) does not change the Security Council’s formal powers or the P5 veto. Security Council gatekeeping remains intact, so such an upgrade does not diminish veto rights or directly alter Security Council decision‑making (see bullet points Index 7 and Index 11).",

Status upgrades can have tangible diplomatic and legal effects—e.g., greater access to GA debates, the ability to join certain treaties or bring legal claims in some fora—so they are more than mere ceremony (Index 7 and Index 9)."

In practice, creating a formal organ tends to increase bureaucratic procedures and can constrain ad‑hoc coalition‑making.

A voluntary P5 code of conduct (or political agreement) to refrain from vetoing resolutions addressing mass atrocities is the most feasible short‑term pathway because it does not require amending the UN Charter. The text describes the veto as a core legal and political obstacle (Index 1) and notes that meaningful change to veto rules would practically necessitate Charter amendment under Article 108/109—requiring P5 consent (Index 1, Index 3). By contrast, voluntary restraint is an incremental, politically negotiated option that can be pursued through diplomatic coalitions, General Assembly pressure, and civil society advocacy (Index 0), and several states and groups have proposed such restraint mechanisms precisely because they avoid the near‑insurmountable legal hurdle of amendment.",

Transferring veto prerogatives to regional organizations (NWF proposal) is conceptually aimed at reducing unilateral deadlock (Index 5), but it faces major legal and political barriers: the UN Charter prescribes state membership and the attribution of Security Council seats to states, so substituting regional organizations would require novel legal interpretation and Charter amendment; it also raises questions about regional legitimacy and internal accountability. Thus, it is not a short‑term feasible alternative.",
