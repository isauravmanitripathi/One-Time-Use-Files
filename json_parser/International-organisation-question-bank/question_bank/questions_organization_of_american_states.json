Bullets 1 and 2 explain Bolívar’s ambitious supranational design, and bullet 2 (Index 2) specifically identifies the absence of prerequisites — domestic stability, elite consensus across states, and mechanisms to overcome centrifugal nationalism — along with civil war and state breakup, as the principal reasons the 1826 project proved politically fragile.",

Bullets 1, 3 and 4 show the shift from Bolívar’s ambitious supranational blueprint to the 1889–90 and 1901–02 conferences that created a technical secretariat (Commercial Bureau/International Commercial Bureau). Bullet 6 explicitly frames this as an ambition‑versus‑feasibility trajectory: maximalist visions often yield to minimal, technical forms that are politically sustainable.",

                "Continuity of personnel (e.g., Alberto Lleras Camargo moving from Pan American Union to first OAS Secretary General) provided institutional memory and legitimacy that allowed the organization to proceed despite domestic turmoil; the lesson is to invest in technocratic continuity to insulate diplomacy from episodic domestic shocks.",

Bullet 6 documents Alberto Lleras Camargo’s continuity from Director General of the Pan American Union to the first OAS Secretary General and later national leader, showing how personnel continuity smoothed institutional transition even after the Bogotazo destabilized conference proceedings. Bullet 0 frames this as part of a broader pattern where leadership continuity can sustain institutional life when domestic politics intrude. The practical lesson is to cultivate experienced technocrats and institutional memory to preserve diplomacy during domestic crises.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Bullet 4 and bullet 5 show the OAS adapted to new postwar security imperatives (TIAR, Charter) rather than being frozen by prior institutional designs. The evidence (bullet 6) suggests that carried‑over personnel facilitated adaptation and legitimacy rather than blocking reform.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Systemic pressures (e.g., Cold War, bullets 4 and 5) mattered, but the Bogotá example (bullet 6) demonstrates the decisive role of individual and institutional continuity in navigating those pressures. Domestic and personnel factors did materially influence multilateral outcomes, not negligible ones.",

While bullet 1 and bullet 2 highlight U.S. centrality (e.g., Pan American Union building in Washington), the Bogotá case emphasizes continuity within the multilateral secretariat rather than simple capture by the U.S. Bullet 6 shows domestic leaders within the inter‑American system exercising stewardship, so continuity cannot be reduced to external dominance alone."

Human‑rights institutions (bullet 6) were important in the OAS trajectory, but the inter‑American case (bullets 3–5) shows that security arrangements and treaties (e.g., TIAR, Charter) were built in parallel with normative instruments, not postponed until norms were fully institutionalized.",
                "2": "Incorrect. While alignment with a great power provided deterrence for some American states (bullet 5 references U.S. leadership), the inter‑American experience (bullet 4) also shows the limits of relying solely on extra‑regional security guarantees—World War II taught that unilateral or extra‑regional assurances could fail—so subordination risks losing regional autonomy and legitimacy.",
                "3": "Correct. This option synthesizes lessons across bullets: bullet 2 shows the move from ad hoc diplomacy to permanent secretariat (Pan American Union) matters for institutionalization; bullet 3 and bullet 4 demonstrate how neutrality and collective approaches (Good Neighbor policy debates and TIAR) were used to manage regional security; bullet 5 shows the value of a formal charter and institutional apex. Bullet 6 underlines leadership continuity. Together these suggest a treaty-backed institution with norms and leadership continuity is most faithful to the inter‑American learning."

Together these indicate Buenos Aires built the institutional foundations that Bogotá later used to formalize security arrangements and human‑rights instruments.",

Bullet 2 notes Washington’s centrality symbolically, but bullet 3 shows smaller states actively proposed ambitious agendas in the 1930s, and bullet 5 shows broad multilateral participation at Bogotá. Thus Bogotá cannot be reduced to mere U.S. ratification.",
