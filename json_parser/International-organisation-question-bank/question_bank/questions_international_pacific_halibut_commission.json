While chartering commercial vessels is cost-effective and historically used by the IPHC (bullet point 5), assuming statistical adjustments can fully correct for gear selectivity is optimistic.

While university campus locations often foster closer academic collaboration and student engagement, the relocation to an industrial/maritime neighborhood is described as offering logistical, maritime advantages rather than enhanced formal academic ties. Bullet point 9 emphasizes logistical advantages; bullet point 11 highlights vessel‑based sampling as a scientific practice, not campus partnership.",

The move to an industrial/maritime area most directly supports operational needs tied to marine science—easy access to ports and berthing, quicker launch and recovery of research vessels, and proximity to gear and cold‑chain logistics. This aligns with the text noting logistical advantages of Interbay and the IPHC’s reliance on vessel‑based sampling and temperature profiling (bullet points 9 and 11)."
