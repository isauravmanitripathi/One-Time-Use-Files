The Danube Commission’s strength lies in being a standing, multilateral body that combines technical management, harmonised rules and operational coordination while respecting national competence: it consults national “special administrations”, issues uniform standards (e.g., traffic rules, pilotage), and leaves implementation and legal authority to contracting parties (bullets 0, 5, 6). This design balances collective action with sovereignty.",

Turning immediately to a universal forum risks sidelining the Commission’s specialized expertise and the riparians’ operational role.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The European Commission has significant competencies within EU member states, but not all Danube riparians are EU members (bullet point 5), and the Danube Commission already provides a multilateral technical forum that includes non-EU riparians. Moreover, navigation-specific technical regulation and operational coordination (dredging schedules, buoying, pilotage) are core tasks of the Commission (bullet points 1 and 6), which a supranational political body might not be best positioned to manage directly without marginalizing non-EU riparians.",

Bilateral treaties can handle very local, specific agreements, but the Danube is a multi-state system where navigation continuity, harmonized standards and traffic rules require multilateral coordination (bullet points 1, 5 and 6). A series of bilateral deals risks producing incompatible technical standards and fragmented pilotage systems across shared reaches (bullet points 5 and 6).",

It has institutional continuity and legitimacy for managing dredging, navigational aids, hydrographic surveys and related operational matters (bullet points 0, 5, 6). Because the dispute centers on technical navigation operations and involves riparian operational coordination, the Commission is the tailored forum to adjudicate or coordinate practical measures while allowing riparians to negotiate trade-offs between navigational needs and environmental concerns."

However, this also meant the Commission’s composition and policies became more directly shaped by regional political dynamics—Cold War divisions, successor-state politics after Yugoslavia’s dissolution, and EU accession processes all influenced membership, influence, and alignments (bullet point 5). This answer captures the trade-off between enhanced riparian agency and increased sensitivity to regional politics.",

The 1948 body did not sever legal continuity from earlier regimes; rather it reconstituted the Commission while tracing its lineage to earlier international arrangements (the Paris Conferences of 1856 and 1921) that established free navigation regimes (bullet point 2). Therefore legal legitimacy continued even as membership logic changed (bullet points 2 and 3).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although non-riparian powers had resources and influence historically, the post-1948 body retained technical expertise among the riparians and continued to carry out core river-commission functions (maintenance, dredging, hydrography, pilotage coordination) (bullet points 5 and 6). The reconstitution reorganized authority rather than necessarily degrading technical capacity.",
                "3": "Incorrect. While reducing the formal role of non-riparian great powers shifted control toward riparians (bullet point 3 and 4), it did not eliminate geopolitical tensions. The Commission subsequently operated through periods (Cold War, Yugoslavia’s breakup, EU integration) when regional politics strongly affected alignments and the Commission’s operation (bullet point 5).

International cooperation remains possible where relevant.",

                "1": "Correct. This option is consistent with the cluster: strategic diplomacy and use of transitional governance mechanisms protect riparian rights and allow participation without forfeiting sovereignty (Bullet 12). Demand for clear competence delineation and accountability addresses risks of politicisation and shifting influence (Bullets 7 and 9). Precedent‑based multi‑stakeholder approaches reduce political risk (Bullet 11).",

                "3": "Incorrect. Immediate pursuit of EU membership is unrealistic for many states (e.g., Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova) and is not a near‑term mitigation strategy; moreover, accession comes with its own legal and political costs and does not align with the graduated, safeguard‑oriented approach recommended (Bullets 8 and 12)."
