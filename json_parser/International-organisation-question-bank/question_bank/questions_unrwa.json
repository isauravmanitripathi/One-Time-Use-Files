This package addresses multiple dimensions highlighted across the cluster: independent investigations and transparent reporting directly tackle accountability and reputational concerns (bullet point 7 and 11); strengthened vetting and disciplinary processes reduce recurrence risk (bullet point 7); a contingency/reserve fund mitigates vulnerability from voluntary funding shocks (bullet point 8); and deeper coordination with UN bodies and NGOs supports protection, contingency planning and continuity of services (bullet point 13). These measures also help protect neutrality and the safety of staff and facilities (bullet points 9 and 10) while remaining politically feasible compared with sweeping structural changes.",
                "1": "Incorrect. Ceasing independent investigations and relying only on internal reviews would weaken credibility (bullet point 7 and 11). Publicly blaming member states and privatizing services risk politicizing humanitarian assistance and could reduce neutrality and coordination (bullet points 9, 11, 13), exacerbating funding and access problems (bullet point 8).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Moving to mandatory assessed contributions would be transformative but politically unrealistic in the short term and would require General Assembly action; immediate centralization and removal of local hiring would undermine operational effectiveness and community legitimacy (bullets 8, 10, 13).",

Redefining refugee eligibility is a highly political move that touches the core of UNRWA’s mandate and would likely generate intense political backlash and further donor fracturing (bullet point 11). Shifting entirely to private providers and moving the agency under a different UN agency ignores operational realities, coordination needs (bullet point 13) and the indispensability of UNRWA’s long‑term footprint (bullet point 10)."

Together these measures balance immediate shock absorption and long‑term resilience."

                "0": "Incorrect. Neutral inaction may avoid immediate entanglement, but it also fails to defend multilateral institutions and can produce reputational costs for appearing indifferent to humanitarian consequences—contrary to the cluster’s recommendations (Bullet 15).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Public condemnation may curry favour with some partners but risks alienating the host state, diminishing India’s leverage, and producing medium‑term costs (humanitarian fallout, erosion of multilateral tools). The cluster suggests a more calibrated mix (Bullet 14, Bullet 15).",
                "2": "Correct. This posture aligns with the cluster’s prescription: defend multilateral norms publicly (to preserve the international legal‑political terrain), use private diplomacy to manage coalitions, and keep operational options open—thus minimizing reputational loss while preserving strategic autonomy (Bullet 14, Bullet 15).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Secret engagement aimed solely at reversal of the ban might preserve autonomy temporarily, but lack of transparent multilateral defence and donor engagement risks reputational damage and undermines cooperative problem solving. The cluster recommends combining visible multilateral defence with private diplomacy and operational flexibility (Bullet 14, Bullet 15)."
