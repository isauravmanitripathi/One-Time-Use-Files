                "0": "Incorrect. While Grotius' mare liberum articulated freedom of the seas (bullet 1), the three-mile practice and Bynkershoek's reasoning represented a narrowing of that ideal. These early practices did not affirm perpetual oceanic freedom but rather contributed building blocks for later jurisdictional claims, so they did not delay but rather influenced the evolution toward codified zones.",
                "1": "Incorrect. The three-mile rule and Bynkershoek did not justify unlimited coastal sovereignty; they justified a limited belt of coastal control tied to enforcement reach (bullet 2 and 3). UNCLOS' zones are therefore not a simple expansion of unlimited sovereignty but a complex allocation reflecting multiple interests.",
                "2": "Incorrect. Although economic and environmental pressures were central drivers of later change (bullet 3), the early juridical concepts were not merely quaint. They provided practical and conceptual precedents (enforcement-based limits) that influenced later legal design, so dismissing them overlooks their formative role (bullets 1–3).",
                "3": "Correct. The three-mile rule was tied to the practical reach of coastal enforcement (popularly the range of shore-based cannon) and van Bynkershoek explicitly grounded maritime jurisdiction in enforcement capability. This illustrates how technological and operational realities shaped legal norms — a dynamic that carried forward into the zonal regime of UNCLOS, which allocates jurisdiction according to functional categories (territorial sea, contiguous zone, EEZ, continental shelf) and enforcement capacities (see bullets 1 and 2)."

While the coastal State has sovereign rights over natural resources and jurisdiction over some economic activities (bullet point 4), it does not have full sovereignty like in the territorial sea; freedoms of navigation and overflight remain for other States (bullet point 5), so blanket licensing and fees for routine transit are not supported by UNCLOS.",
                "1": "Partially misleading and therefore incorrect. It is true that the coastal State may regulate activities related to exploitation of living and non‑living resources in the EEZ (bullet point 4). However, the option implies that the coastal State may otherwise freely regulate passage, which is false: freedom of navigation/overflight continues to apply to vessels not engaged in exploitation (bullet point 5).",
                "2": "Correct. UNCLOS distinguishes between the coastal State’s sovereign rights for exploration, exploitation and management of natural resources and its jurisdiction over certain economic activities in the EEZ, on the one hand, and the preservation of other States’ freedoms of navigation and overflight, on the other (see bullet point 4). The principle of freedom of the seas is balanced against coastal‑state rights (bullet point 5). A blanket requirement to license and charge fees for ordinary transit through the EEZ would infringe the navigation and overflight freedoms that UNCLOS preserves for other States.",
                "3": "Incorrect as stated. The coastal State does have jurisdiction to adopt laws for marine environmental protection in the EEZ (bullet point 4), but environmental measures must be reasonable, non‑discriminatory and consistent with the freedoms of navigation and overflight. A wholesale licensing regime for all transit justified broadly on environmental grounds would likely be disproportionate and inconsistent with UNCLOS’s balance between coastal rights and freedom of the seas (bullet point 5)."

In the immediate postwar environment, unilateral assertions proved effective in creating practice that later influenced customary law and regional claims (see also Latin American declarations, bullet 6).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Mare liberum (bullet 1) posits oceanic freedom, which does not provide a legal basis for a coastal state's unilateral resource jurisdiction. Using that doctrine would undermine rather than support a claim to seabed resources.",

Bilateral agreements with fishing states might address fishing access but would not by themselves establish widely recognized sovereignty or jurisdiction over seabed minerals. Historical practice shows unilateral proclamations and regional assertions (e.g., Latin American 200 nm claims, bullet 6) produced more immediate shifts in state practice.",

UNCLOS establishes that baselines normally follow the low-water line as shown on large-scale charts, and where coasts are unstable a state may validly adopt straight baselines (subject to legal criteria). Because baselines are the reference for all maritime zones, unilateral attempts to manipulate baselines to expand entitlements are likely to be contested. Other states can challenge such baselines and seek resolution through UNCLOS dispute-settlement mechanisms; in practice, this creates strategic consequences and incentives for negotiated settlement or adjudication.

Bullet Index 11 highlights that because the ISA will be central to any future deep‑seabed mining regime, India benefits from active engagement to influence rule‑making and benefit‑sharing. Bullet Index 12 emphasises the role of environmental risk and the precautionary principle, so investing in scientific capacity and baseline studies supports credible environmental stewardship.

This mixed strategy best advances India’s strategic, economic and normative interests.",
