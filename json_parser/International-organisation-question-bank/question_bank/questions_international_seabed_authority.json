While bullet 5 records calls for delay or moratoria grounded in the precautionary principle and concerns about slow recovery, an open‑ended moratorium until ‘absolute scientific certainty’ is achieved is impractical and unlikely to be politically acceptable.

Consequently, robust environmental regulation, baseline monitoring (photographic/video and sensor data—bullet 5), and clearly defined thresholds before escalation to extractive phases are scientifically warranted despite the exploratory label (bullets 0 and 1).",

Even non‑intrusive methods are not entirely impact‑free (e.g., noise, light, shading, vessel presence) and avoiding all drilling/coring may preclude answering key questions about quantity/quality and geotechnical properties (bullet 1). Moreover, restricting methods as a blanket condition does not address cumulative or long‑term risks; hence conditional relaxation is not a sound substitute for precautionary regulation."

                "1": "Incorrect. Private capital plays a role, but deep‑sea exploration is capital‑intensive, technologically demanding and politically sensitive; most large contractors operate with state sponsorship or within state consortia, and states remain central in access and policy influence (see bullet point 9).",

Without agreed environmental rules, liability and benefit‑sharing, states and state‑sponsored contractors may pursue exploitation to secure strategic minerals, increasing environmental risk because appropriate operational standards and monitoring are absent.

This combination responds to both the loss of external coverage (Bullet 3) and member‑state/environmental concerns about diminishing transparency (Bullet 4).",

                "Approach B is more effective because demonstrating hard power compels ISA members to adopt regulations favourable to a security‑dominant state.",

ISA governance is primarily shaped through technical standards, scientific evidence and normative coalitions—activities like observatories, atlases, training and African outreach enhance India’s institutional influence and legitimacy in standard‑setting (bullet 14 on science diplomacy; bullet 19 on strategic significance of modest commitments; bullet 16 on creating coalitions).",
                "1": "Incorrect. The two approaches are complementary but not equivalent; technical engagement is far more directly relevant to ISA rule‑making than hard‑security postures (bullets 14 and 19 emphasize the role of evidence and norms).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Hard security may influence strategic dynamics in the region, but ISA’s formal regulatory processes are not resolved through coercion; they require technical credibility and multilateral consensus, which are gained via science diplomacy and capacity‑building (contrast with bullet 14 and 19).",

Economic incentives are an important tool but not the only effective one; they cannot substitute for technical credibility and coalition‑building required to influence ISA standards (bullet 18 on integration with development policy complements but does not replace scientific engagement)."
