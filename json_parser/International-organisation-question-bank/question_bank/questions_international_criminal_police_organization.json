It facilitates notices (e.g., Red Notices) and cooperation, but arrest and extradition remain subject to national laws and judicial processes. This option conflates Interpol’s notice functions with legally binding arrest orders, which is a common misconception.",
                "2": "Correct. Interpol’s core role is to facilitate police cooperation by providing operational support, investigative expertise, access to forensic and communications systems, and training to member police services (see bullet point 1 and 6). These capabilities are precisely what a national police force lacking specialized forensic capacity would request and what Interpol historically and currently provides.",

Interpol may assist by sharing information or coordinating requests, but it cannot bypass bilateral or domestic legal instruments (bullet points 1 and 6 indicate facilitation and technical support, not extraterritorial policing)."

While operational urgency is important, history and Interpol’s post‑war legal framework (notably Article 3 as highlighted in the overview) prohibit the organization from intervening in political matters.

Forwarding the request without scrutiny shifts responsibility but fails to meet Interpol’s duty to filter requests for political motivation; it risks exporting politicized requests to other states.

Thus, rules mediate outcomes without fully removing political dynamics.",
