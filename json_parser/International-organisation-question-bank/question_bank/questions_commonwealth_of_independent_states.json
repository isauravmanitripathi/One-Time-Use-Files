This response aligns with the CIS’s practical institutional character (bullet point 2) and membership heterogeneity (bullet point 4): states often implement commitments selectively and participation is politically contingent. Bullet point 3 shows the CIS can facilitate cross‑border law enforcement and trade corridors in functional domains without requiring full political engagement. Combining selective CIS technical engagement with alternative economic arrangements (bullet point 6 highlights that deeper integration for some states occurs via the EAEU or other mechanisms) allows the state to keep benefits while limiting exposure to politicised CIS organs (bullet point 5 illustrates the political risk dimension).",

Full alignment with the EAEU and active participation in CIS political organs increases economic integration and potential security cooperation but also deepens political ties to Russia, thus raising the very political exposure the state wants to minimise (bullet points 5 and 6). This strategy trades risk reduction for greater dependency.",

Immediate, blanket withdrawal may close off useful technical cooperation (trade facilitation, law‑enforcement coordination described in bullet point 3) and is politically costly (bullet point 5 shows withdrawals often follow conflict and can escalate tensions).

So increased leakage is not a likely consequence of well‑designed digital reform.",

Domestic liberalisation alone does not mitigate external legal risks (e.g., sanctions, reservation lists, ISDS exposure) nor does it secure market access absent diplomatic engagement.

Metal type and fineness directly influence intrinsic bullion value: silver (even at 900 vs 925 fineness) contains significant silver content and thus higher bullion value than copper‑nickel (bullet 3). The fineness difference, while modest, does change the amount of pure silver per coin and thus affects bullion value and can influence collector pricing.
