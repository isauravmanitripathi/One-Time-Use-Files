The pattern is one of legal aspiration constrained by geopolitical reality (bullet 0).",

The Nuremberg and Tokyo tribunals (1945–46) operationalized concepts like crimes against humanity and provided procedural precedents (bullet 3), so doctrinal vacuum alone does not explain the failures of 1919/1937.",

This option integrates points across the cluster: the ILC and PrepCom deliberations (Bullets 1 and 3) show States debated scope and safeguards; ad hoc tribunals (Bullet 2) revealed political sensitivities about selective prosecutions; and the roll call of seven against (Bullet 6) included States with sovereignty/security concerns (e.g., the United States), as well as Israel’s specific objection to the population‑transfer war‑crime provision.

Tribunals therefore examine contextual evidence (scale, policies, demographic measures, statements) to infer intent rather than relying solely on the proffered purpose (bullet point index 3 and 4).

Crimes against humanity are designed to address widespread or systematic attacks against civilians and do not require the dolus specialis (specific intent to destroy a group as such) that defines genocide (bullet point index 5).

Genocide requires dolus specialis, and it is not ‘automatically’ available simply because attacks are large-scale; furthermore, political groups are excluded from genocide protection (bullet points index 2, 4, and 5).

While large‑scale killings are a strong contextual indicator, isolated threats by low‑level perpetrators and the absence of coordination reduce the probative force for proving the specific intent required for genocide.

The Genocide Convention and Rome Statute place specific obligations on States to prevent and punish genocide with respect to the narrowly defined protected groups (national, ethnical, racial, religious) (bullet point index 0 and 4).

This assessment captures the nuanced design of Article 8bis: it targets leadership-level criminal responsibility, aligns with UN Charter practice, was activated through politically sensitive ratification and ASP steps, sets a high ‘manifest violation’ threshold that limits prosecutions, and preserves important roles for the Security Council and national jurisdictions.

While questions of immunities for state officials and peacekeepers can complicate arrest and surrender (practical and political obstacles), they do not automatically preclude jurisdiction.

A Security Council referral can define the temporal scope of jurisdiction for a referred situation, and if the Council specifies the 2004–2006 period it could bring that period within ICC investigations even for a state that ratified later (bullet points 7 and 8).

Invoking broad immunities and blanket non‑cooperation may preserve short‑term sovereignty claims, but it risks reputational damage, possible Security Council action (which can override non‑party status in practice), and accusations of impunity. It neither credibly addresses atrocity crimes nor prevents referrals (bullet points 8, 9, 10 and 11).",

Crime Z (Mar 2025) occurred after the 1 July 2002 baseline (so not excluded by the baseline alone) but still predates the Statute’s entry into force for India (2 March 2026 in this scenario).

Repressing civil society is a possible reaction, but it is strategically risky: it undermines rule of law domestically and can backfire by increasing international criticism.

The Bemba sequence (conviction for sexual violence in March 2016; appeals overturning conviction in June 2018; ICC’s refusal to compensate for losses during lengthy detention — bullet 5) underlines a normative lacuna: the Court’s existing remedial architecture focuses heavily on victim reparations but lacks a clear compensatory regime for those ultimately acquitted or whose convictions are reversed.

Domestic courts can review executive action under national constitutional law — as in South Africa — and can require parliamentary approval or set aside executive-only withdrawals; such domestic invalidation can lead governments to revoke notifications. Separately, ICC competence covers crimes committed while the state was party to the Statute, which includes conduct during the one-year period before withdrawal becomes effective (i.e., investigations and proceedings concerning pre-withdrawal conduct remain within the Court’s competence). (See bullets 4, 6, 5, 7, 0.)",

The ICC does not adjudicate the domestic constitutionality of a state’s executive acts; domestic courts can determine whether the executive complied with internal constitutional or statutory procedures. While the ICC’s jurisdictional questions turn on treaty status (the UN notification timeline), domestic judicial findings can prompt governments to revoke notifications or otherwise change course, as occurred in South Africa and the Gambia. Thus it is incorrect to say the Rome Statute ‘automatically remains in force until the ICC rules on domestic legality.’ The ICC does not engage in that domestic legality review.

                "3": "Correct. The divergent outcomes are best explained by domestic political change and judicial review. The Gambia’s change of government after the December 2016 election led the incoming administration to rescind the withdrawal; South Africa’s domestic courts found the executive’s unilateral withdrawal unconstitutional or procedurally defective, prompting revocation; by contrast, Burundi’s government remained in power and its notification became effective after one year.

Experience from 2016–17 does not show unified international support following withdrawal announcements; instead, withdrawals often attract criticism, scrutiny and potential operational friction.

Although the ICC prosecutes individuals, a state’s withdrawal signals positions on international justice and can affect diplomatic relations, cooperation in investigations, and perceptions of rule-of-law commitments. The case studies demonstrate reputational effects beyond the Court’s prosecutorial scope. (See bullet 0.)"

This option reflects Rome Statute Article 127’s retroactivity rule and the practical reality that the ICC can continue to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed while the state remained a party. However, enforcement (including arrest) requires state cooperation; states not party to the Statute are not legally bound to effect arrests (bullet point 2). The case study emphasises this legal/practical tension (bullet point 0).",

Security Council referrals are one of the alternative bases for ICC jurisdiction, but they are independent mechanisms (bullet point 1). Article 127 deals only with withdrawal timing and non‑retroactivity, not any automatic Security Council role (bullet point 2).",

Article 127 provides that withdrawal takes effect one year after notification and does not retroactively eliminate the Court’s jurisdiction over crimes committed while the state was a party or that are otherwise within the Court’s jurisdictional reach (see bullet point 2). Therefore withdrawal cannot simply erase existing jurisdiction or invalidate ongoing investigations.",

While State Parties do have an obligation under the Rome Statute to cooperate with ICC arrest warrants, the obligation does not automatically translate into an uncontested, risk‑free action. The South African experience (Bullets 1–3) shows that immediate arrest of a visiting head of state raises complex diplomatic and constitutional challenges.

While Article 17 requires the ICC to assess whether a national process is genuinely investigating or prosecuting (index 1), not every flaw or interference automatically converts a case into one the ICC must take. The complementarity test looks to genuineness, meaning systemic or decisive interference may justify ICC action, but the immediate opening of an investigation without assessing the prospects of remediation or engagement would ignore the Statute’s residual design and the policy emphasis on supporting national systems (indexes 1, 0).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Referral to the UN Security Council is neither required nor a routine step under the complementarity regime. It would politicize the process further and is not a necessary precondition to assess national genuineness under Article 17 (index 1). The option also bypasses the more nuanced, evidence‑based evaluation and possible capacity‑building responses discussed in practice and scholarship (indexes 0, 6).",

This option best synthesizes the legal test in Article 17 (the ‘genuinely’ unwilling/unable standard) with practical policy discussions that urge the ICC to move beyond a purely accusatory role by supporting credible national prosecutions (indexes 1 and 0). It also reflects lessons from sensitive contexts (e.g., al‑Senussi) where political realities require calibrated engagement rather than immediate substitution (index 5), and mirrors prosecutorial practice that signals willingness to engage with national jurisdictions while preserving the ICC’s residual role (index 6).",
