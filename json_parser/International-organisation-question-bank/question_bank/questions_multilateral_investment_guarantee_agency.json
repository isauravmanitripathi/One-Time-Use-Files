Bilateral IPTs and home‑country insurers can provide some protection, but they do not match the layered credit enhancement and political‑risk underwriting credibility of MIGA.

Strengthening domestic guarantees can help, but domestic schemes typically lack the international credibility, scale and risk diversification that MIGA’s membership confers.
