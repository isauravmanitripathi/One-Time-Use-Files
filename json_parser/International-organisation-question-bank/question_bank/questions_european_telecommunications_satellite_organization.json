The Eutelsat example shows the value of a convention that codified a public‑interest mission (bullet 2 and 3) while later restructuring to separate public‑interest functions from competitive commercial activities (bullet 0). Effective spectrum/orbital coordination is a regulatory safeguard tied to public tasks, and a market‑oriented subsidiary allows commercial agility (bullet 4) while statutory oversight preserves policy goals.",

While informal coordination (like CEPT’s incubating role in 1977 — bullet 1) can foster cooperation, the Eutelsat Convention (bullet 2 and 3) shows that hard legal instruments are necessary to lock in public missions, governance arrangements and spectrum/orbital coordination as technology and markets evolve (bullet 4).",
