                "Examine NEAFC-related documents such as memoranda of understanding, formal notifications and minutes of meetings to confirm the precise scope and legal basis of cooperation.",

                "0": "Correct. The suggested verification step is to confirm the precise scope and legal basis in NEAFC documentation—MoUs, formal notifications and minutes—to establish whether obligations are substantive, conditional or limited to specific activities (Bullet 13). This is crucial because cooperation can be narrow or revocable (Bullet 11).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Press releases and statements may be useful for signalling intent but are insufficient to determine legal scope or bindingness; the recommended verification is documentary (Bullet 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Observer access or occasional data exchanges are indicators of cooperation but do not by themselves prove the legal scope or durability of obligations; CNCP commitments can be limited to such activities (Bullets 11 and 13).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Behavioural data like AIS can indicate compliance in practice but cannot substitute for documentary proof of legal commitments; moreover, behaviour can change and obligations may still be limited or revocable (Bullets 11 and 13)."

                "0": "Correct. This option synthesises the NEAFC-derived lessons: treat flag and port governance reforms as security tools to combat IUU and protect SLOCs; prioritise interoperability in MCS as part of compliance architecture; use graduated engagement to preserve flexibility; and verify the legal scope of cooperation through MoUs/notifications to guard against narrow or revocable commitments (Bullets 12, 10, 11, 13).",
                "1": "Incorrect. Keeping obligations vague preserves short-term flexibility but increases the risk that cooperation will be limited, conditional, or revocable, and will fail to materially improve enforcement or close registry/port loopholes (Bullets 11, 10 and 13).",
                "2": "Incorrect. Observer programmes and voluntary data help but do not address registry/port loopholes or the revocability/narrowness of CNCP obligations; without legal and governance reforms the measures may be insufficient (Bullets 10 and 11).",
                "3": "Incorrect. Technical interoperability and intelligence-sharing are necessary but not sufficient; without flag/port reforms and verified legal commitments, CNCP arrangements may remain limited or revocable and leave loopholes for IUU actors (Bullets 10, 11 and 12)."
