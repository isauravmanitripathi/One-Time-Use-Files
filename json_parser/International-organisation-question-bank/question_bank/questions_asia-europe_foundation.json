As a policy planner in India’s Ministry of External Affairs seeking to use ASEF channels to mitigate these risks without coercive measures, which ASEF pillar or instrument would be the most immediate and effective lever to rebuild cross‑societal trust and counter misperceptions?",

These activities are tailored to mitigate misperceptions and build societal trust, addressing identity‑based polarization as a non‑kinetic security challenge. While other pillars matter, cultural programming is the most immediate, low‑risk channel to engage civil society and diaspora networks and to restore social trust across borders.",
                "1": "Incorrect — Education exchanges (Bullet 3) reshape elite socialisation and produce longer‑term changes in networks and norms, useful for strategic culture, but they are slower to influence mass perceptions. Scholarships and academic ties are important for future resilience but not the most immediate instrument to counter an acute rise in identity‑based polarization.",
                "2": "Incorrect — Economic programmes (Bullet 4) create shared interests and can reduce incentives for conflict, but trade and SME linkages take time to build and may not address emotive identity narratives driving polarization. Economic measures are complementary but not the most direct lever for rebuilding societal trust in the short to medium term.",
                "3": "Incorrect — Governance projects (Bullet 3) strengthen institutions and transparency, which help long‑term resilience, but they are less immediate tools for countering popular misperceptions and social narratives. They address structural vulnerabilities rather than the cultural and identity drivers of polarization, and may not directly change public perceptions in partner societies as quickly as cultural engagement."

Greater reliance on co-financing allows ASEF to marshal non‑state resources and specialist expertise, enabling larger or more innovative programmes (bullet points 4 and 5).
