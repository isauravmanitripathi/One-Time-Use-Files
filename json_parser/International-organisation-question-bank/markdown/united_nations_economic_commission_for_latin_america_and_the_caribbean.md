Map showing the member states of ECLAC

The **United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean**
(**UNECLAC** , **ECLAC** or _**CEPAL**_ , in Spanish: _Comisión Económica para
América Latina y el Caribe_) is a United Nations regional commission to
encourage economic cooperation. The ECLAC includes 46 member states (20 in
Latin America, 13 in the Caribbean and 13 from outside the region), and 14
associate members which are various non-independent territories, associated
island countries and a commonwealth in the Caribbean. The ECLAC publishes
statistics covering the countries of the region and makes cooperative
agreements with nonprofit institutions. The headquarters of ECLAC is in
Santiago, Chile.

The ECLAC was established in 1948 as the UN Economic Commission for Latin
America. In 1984, a resolution was passed to include the countries of the
Caribbean in the name. It reports to the UN Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC).

## Themes and programs

### Implementing Sustainable Development Goals

A mapping of the ECLAC’s activities to the Sustainable Development Goals (in
2023) shows that its current work emphasizes four SDGs; namely, SDG 17 on
partnerships, SDG 8 on decent work, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, and SDG 16
on peace and justice. In practice, the ECLAC strives toward its own regional
paradigm, called Global Environmental Keynesianism, which promotes
multidimensional equality as the purpose of development. The commission seeks
to balance the new SDGs with its earlier focus on equality and to better
emphasize the environmental dimension of economic development.

The ECLAC has been working on a debt-swap strategy since 2016, titled the
_Debt forClimate Adaptation Swap and Caribbean Resilience Fund_. This fund
aims to reduce the debt and fiscal constraints for investment in green
industries, stimulate growth, promote economic transformation, and expand
fiscal space for public investment such as for the SDGs.
