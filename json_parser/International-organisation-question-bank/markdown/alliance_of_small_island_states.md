Intergovernmental organization

**Alliance of Small Island States** (**AOSIS**) is an intergovernmental
organization of low-lying coastal and small island countries. AOSIS was
established in 1990, ahead of the Second World Climate Conference. The main
purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of Small Island
Developing States (SIDS) to address global warming.

These island countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change and its
related effects on the ocean, including sea level rise, coastal erosion and
saltwater intrusion. The members are among the nations least responsible for
climate change, having contributed less than 1% to the world's greenhouse gas
emissions. These states advocate for international policy and mechanisms for
addressing the inequity of climate impacts.

## Organization

AOSIS is recognized as the negotiating voice for SIDS through the United
Nations (UN) system. Its highest decision make body is the biannual meeting of
the Heads of State and Government of Member States, which sets policy
direction and adopts regular Declarations and Communiques. The Plenary of
Permanent Representatives to the United Nations takes decisions, which are
implemented through a Secretariat hosted at the Permanent Mission of the
Chair.

## Mission

AOSIS' core focus areas are climate change, sustainable development and ocean
conservation.

SIDS are among the nations least responsible for climate change, having
contributed less than 1% to the world's greenhouse gas emissions. They are
particularly vulnerable to its effects, with some islands at risk of becoming
uninhabitable due to sea level rise. AOSIS has consistently raised this threat
of uninhabitability created by climate change in climate negotiations.

SIDS, of which AOSIS is predominantly comprised, account for less than 1% of
the global GDP, territory, and population, meaning that individually SIDS hold
little political weight in international climate negotiations. The aim of
AOSIS is to amplify the voices of its members by joining together states which
face similar issues. This is to increase their ability to influence climate
negotiations and raise awareness for its concerns.

## Actions

AOSIS has been very active from its inception. It has played a leading role in
the global arena in raising awareness on climate change and advocating for
action to address climate change. The creation of the alliance marked the
beginning of the growth in influence of SIDS in climate politics. Despite
their size and their relatively small economic and political weight, AOSIS
member states have pulled above their weight in climate change negotiations.

AOSIS played an important role in establishing the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and was an important actor in the
negotiations of the Framework in 1992. Its advocacy was instrumental to the
inclusion of references to the greater vulnerability and special needs of SIDS
in Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC. However, AOSIS was unsuccessful in its attempts
to persuade nations to include commitments to specified greenhouse gas
emission reduction targets in the Framework.

AOSIS continued to advocate for the special needs of SIDS during the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the 'special case' of SIDS was recognised
in Agenda 21, the political action plan which resulted from the Summit. AOSIS'
proposal to create an 'international insurance fund', funded by developed
countries to compensate SIDS for damage caused by climate change, was turned
down. In Rio, AOSIS broadened its mandate beyond climate change to also
include the sustainable development of SIDS. AOSIS negotiated for the
inclusion of a small program area on the sustainable development of small
islands in Agenda 21. Agenda 21 was not legally binding, and some academics
contend that the program was too vague to promote meaningful action.

AOSIS did manage to secure the inclusion in Agenda 21 of a call for a global
conference on this issue, which led to the first Global Conference on the
Sustainable Development of Small Island States, held in Barbados in 1994.
AOSIS played a prominent role at the Conference. It was the first UN
conference entirely devoted to SIDS. The Conference resulted in the
translation of Agenda 21 into a more comprehensive programme, the Barbados
Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing
States. The five year review of the Barbados Conference, conducted at a
special session of the UN General Assembly in 1999, found that the SIDS
efforts to make progress towards sustainable development had been limited,
while the ten year review of the Barbados Conference, which took the form of
an international meeting in Mauritius in 2005, found that its implementation
was largely unsuccessful.

AOSIS put forward the first draft text in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations as
early as 1994. AOSIS member states Fiji and Antigua and Barbuda were the first
states to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 1998.

AOSIS has used formal and informal meetings scheduled in advance of UN climate
change conferences to raise awareness and political momentum for its mission.
AOSIS has also used the media to raise awareness for its concerns. For
example, in the lead up to the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in
Copenhagen, members of the cabinet of the Maldives, an AOSIS member state,
held an underwater cabinet meeting to create awareness of the threat that
climate change poses to the very existence of the Maldives. The stunt garnered
international attention.

At the UN Climate Change Conference in Berlin in 1995, AOSIS advocated very
strongly for a commitment to timetables and target measures for climate
change. It gained the support of developed nations including China, Brazil,
and India. AOSIS had advocated since 2008 for the inclusion of a temperature
target to restrain global warming to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. Many
of the AOSIS member states were present at the Conference in Copenhagen.
Democracy Now! reported that members from the island state of Tuvalu
interrupted a session of the Conference on 10 December 2009 to demand that
global temperature rise be limited to 1.5 °C instead of the proposed 2 °C.
This advocacy continued in the lead up to the 2015 UNFCCC in Paris. AOSIS
initiated the negotiating agenda item which would lead to the inclusion of the
1.5 °C target and was important in gaining support for its inclusion from
vulnerable African and Asian countries and LDC countries. According to writer
and activist Mark Lynas, the inclusion of the 1.5 °C target in the Paris
Agreement was 'almost entirely' due to the advocacy of SIDS and other
developing countries.

At the 2013 Warsaw climate change conference, AOSIS pushed for the
establishment of an international mechanism on loss and damages stressed by
the wreckage of Supertyphoon Haiyan. As the existence of many AOSIS member
states are put at risk by climate change, AOSIS has threatened lawsuits. The
results of a recent review of the literature show that potential liability for
climate change-related losses for AOSIS is over $570 trillion. AOSIS raised
this issue again at the 2015 UNFCCC in Paris. AOSIS was instrumental in the
inclusion of Article 8 in the Paris Agreement, which 'recognizes the
importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage' caused by
climate change, although the article does not 'provide a basis for any
liability of compensation'. As in previous climate agreements, AOSIS members
were among the first to ratify the Paris Agreement, with Fiji ratifying first,
followed days later by the Republic of Marshall Islands, Palau, the Maldives,
and others.

AOSIS member state Fiji co-hosted the UN Oceans Conference in 2017. Ministers
from AOSIS member states, including Fiji, Tuvalu, and Palau used this
conference to again raise awareness of the real risk that the impact of
climate change poses to the very existence of their nations and to advocate
for action to address climate change. Fiji also presided over the 2017 UN
Climate Change Conference, making it the first SIDS to preside over a UN
conference on climate change, although the event took place in Bonn due to
Fiji's remote location, small size and limited infrastructure.

Agreement was reached suddenly at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change
Conference (COP28) on the final day. Anna Rasmussen who was the chief
negotiator for AOSIS was shocked to find that the decision had been made while
the AOSIS delegation was not present.

## AOSIS membership

AOSIS has a membership of 39 global states, of which 37 are members of the UN
while 2 (Cook Islands and Niue) participate within UN agencies. The alliance
represents 28% of the developing countries, and 20% of the UN's total
membership.

AOSIS has a heterogeneous membership with member states spread across many
different global regions. While AOSIS' focus is on SIDS, its membership also
includes several low-lying coastal countries, for example Belize and Guyana,
and larger islands, for example Papua New Guinea. Member nations also vary
economically, with AOSIS including both wealthy nations, such as Singapore, as
well as least developed countries (LDCs), such as Haiti. Some scholars contend
that AOSIS' heterogeneity has weakened its effectiveness, particularly in
regard to its lobbying for sustainable development.

The common factor which unites AOSIS members is their particular vulnerability
to climate change.
