International financial institution

The **International Monetary Fund** (**IMF**) is an international financial
institution and a specialized agency of the United Nations, headquartered in
Washington, D.C. It consists of 190 member countries, and its stated mission
is "working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability,
facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable
economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world." The IMF acts as a
lender of last resort to its members experiencing actual or potential balance
of payments crises.

Established in July 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference based on the ideas of
Harry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, the IMF came into formal existence
in 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the
international monetary system. For its first three decades, the IMF oversaw
the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rate arrangements. Following the
collapse of this system in 1971, the Fund's role shifted to managing balance-
of-payments difficulties and international financial crises, becoming a key
institution in the era of globalization.

Through a quota system, countries contribute funds to a pool from which they
can borrow if they experience balance-of-payments problems; a country's quota
also determines its voting power. As a condition for loans, the IMF often
requires borrowing countries to undertake policy reforms, known as structural
adjustment. The organization also provides technical assistance and economic
surveillance of its members' economies.

The IMF's loan conditions have been widely criticized for imposing austerity
measures that can hinder economic recovery and harm the most vulnerable
populations. Critics argue that the Fund's policies limit the economic
sovereignty of borrowing nations and that its governance structure is
dominated by Western countries, which hold a disproportionate share of voting
power. The current managing director and chairperson is Bulgarian economist
Kristalina Georgieva, who has held the position since 1 October 2019.

## Functions

Board of Governors International Monetary Fund (1999)

According to the IMF itself, it works to foster global growth and economic
stability by providing policy advice and financing to its members. It also
works with developing countries to help them achieve macroeconomic stability
and reduce poverty. The rationale for this is that private international
capital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to
financial markets. Such market imperfections, together with balance-of-
payments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without
which many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances
through measures with adverse economic consequences. The IMF provides
alternate sources of financing such as the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility.

Upon the founding of the IMF, its three primary functions were:

  * to oversee the fixed exchange rate arrangements between countries, thus helping national governments manage their exchange rates and allowing these governments to prioritize economic growth, and
  * to provide short-term capital to aid the balance of payments and prevent the spread of international financial crisis.
  * to help mend the pieces of the international economy after the Great Depression and World War II as well as to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as infrastructure.[_citation needed_]

The IMF's role was fundamentally altered by the floating exchange rates after
1971. It shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with IMF loan
agreements to determine whether a shortage of capital was due to economic
fluctuations or economic policy. The IMF also researched what types of
government policy would ensure economic recovery. A particular concern of the
IMF was to prevent financial crises, such as those in Mexico in 1982, Brazil
in 1987, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial
crisis, from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and
currency system. The challenge was to promote and implement a policy that
reduced the frequency of crises among emerging market countries, especially
the middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows.
Rather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their
function became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance
of member countries. Their role became a lot more active because the IMF now
manages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.[_citation needed_]

In addition, the IMF negotiates conditions on lending and loans under their
policy of conditionality, which was established in the 1950s. Low-income
countries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of
time with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the
Standby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Non-
concessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through
the Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the
Precautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The
IMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to
members facing urgent balance-of-payments needs.

## Surveillance of the global economy

The IMF is mandated to oversee the international monetary and financial system
and monitor the economic and financial policies of its member countries.
Accurate estimations require a degree of participatory surveillance. Market
sizes and economic facts are estimated using member-state data, shared and
verifiable by the organization's other member-states. This transparency is
intended to facilitate international co-operation and trade. Since the demise
of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s,
surveillance has evolved largely by way of changes in procedures rather than
through the adoption of new obligations.

The Fund typically analyses the appropriateness of each member country's
economic and financial policies for achieving orderly economic growth, and
assesses the consequences of these policies for other countries and for the
global economy. For instance, The IMF played a significant role in individual
countries, such as Armenia and Belarus, in providing financial support to
achieve stabilization financing from 2009 to 2019. The maximum sustainable
debt level of a polity, which is watched closely by the IMF, was defined in
2011 by IMF economists to be 120%. Indeed, it was at this number that the
Greek government-debt crisis started in 2010.

In 1995, the International Monetary Fund began to work on data dissemination
standards with the view of guiding IMF member countries to disseminate their
economic and financial data to the public. The International Monetary and
Financial Committee (IMFC) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination
standards and they were split into two tiers: The General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) and the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

The executive board approved the SDDS and GDDS in 1996 and 1997, respectively,
and subsequent amendments were published in a revised _Guide to the General
Data Dissemination System_. The system is aimed primarily at statisticians and
aims to improve many aspects of statistical systems in a country. It is also
part of the World Bank Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Poverty
Reduction Strategic Papers (PRSPs).[_citation needed_]

The primary objective of the GDDS is to encourage member countries to build a
framework to improve data quality and statistical capacity building to
evaluate statistical needs, set priorities in improving timeliness,
transparency, reliability, and accessibility of financial and economic data.
Some countries initially used the GDDS, but later upgraded to SDDS.[_citation
needed_]

Some entities that are not IMF members also contribute statistical data to the
systems:

  * Palestinian Authority – GDDS
  * Hong Kong – SDDS
  * Macau – GDDS
  * Institutions of the European Union: 
    * The European Central Bank for the Eurozone – SDDS
    * Eurostat for the whole EU – SDDS, thus providing data from Cyprus (not using any DDSystem on its own) and Malta (using only GDDS on its own)[_citation needed_]

A 2021 study found that the IMF's surveillance activities have "a substantial
impact on sovereign debt with much greater impacts in emerging than high-
income economies".

## Conditionality of loans

IMF conditionality is a set of policies or conditions that the IMF requires in
exchange for financial resources. The IMF does require collateral from
countries for loans but also requires the government seeking assistance to
correct its macroeconomic imbalances in the form of policy reform. If the
conditions are not met, the funds are withheld. The concept of conditionality
was introduced in a 1952 executive board decision and later incorporated into
the Articles of Agreement.[_citation needed_]

Conditionality is associated with economic theory as well as an enforcement
mechanism for repayment. Stemming primarily from the work of Jacques Polak,
the theoretical underpinning of conditionality was the "monetary approach to
the balance of payments".

### Structural adjustment

Some of the conditions for structural adjustment can include:

  * Cutting expenditures or raising revenues, also known as austerity.
  * Focusing economic output on direct export and resource extraction,
  * Devaluation of currencies,
  * Trade liberalisation, or lifting import and export restrictions,
  * Increasing the stability of investment (by supplementing foreign direct investment with the opening of facilities for the domestic market),
  * Balancing budgets and not overspending,
  * Removing price controls and state subsidies,
  * Privatization, or divestiture of all or part of state-owned enterprises,
  * Enhancing the rights of foreign investors vis-a-vis national laws,
  * Improving governance and fighting corruption,

These conditions are known as the Washington Consensus.

### Benefits

These loan conditions ensure that the borrowing country will be able to repay
the IMF and that the country will not attempt to solve their balance-of-
payment problems in a way that would negatively impact the international
economy. The incentive problem of moral hazard—when economic agents maximise
their own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full
consequences of their actions—is mitigated through conditions rather than
providing collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess
internationally valuable collateral anyway.

Conditionality also reassures the IMF that the funds lent to them will be used
for the purposes defined by the Articles of Agreement and provides safeguards
that the country will be able to rectify its macroeconomic and structural
imbalances. In the judgment of the IMF, the adoption by the member of certain
corrective measures or policies will allow it to repay the IMF, thereby
ensuring that the resources will be available to support other members.

As of 2004[update], borrowing countries have had a good track record for
repaying credit extended under the IMF's regular lending facilities with full
interest over the duration of the loan. This indicates that IMF lending does
not impose a burden on creditor countries, as lending countries receive
market-rate interest on most of their quota subscription, plus any of their
own-currency subscriptions that are loaned out by the IMF, plus all of the
reserve assets that they provide the IMF.

## History

### 20th century

Plaque Commemorating the Formation of the IMF in July 1944 at the Bretton
Woods Conference The Gold Room within the Mount Washington Hotel, where the
Bretton Woods Conference attendees signed the agreements creating the IMF and
World Bank First page of the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund, 1 March 1946, Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs archives

The IMF was originally laid out as a part of the Bretton Woods system exchange
agreement in 1944. During the Great Depression, countries sharply raised
barriers to trade in an attempt to improve their failing economies. This led
to the devaluation of national currencies and a decline in world trade.

This breakdown in international monetary cooperation created a need for
oversight. The representatives of 45 governments met at the Bretton Woods
Conference in the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in
the United States, to discuss a framework for postwar international economic
cooperation and how to rebuild Europe.[_citation needed_]

There were two views on the role the IMF should assume as a global economic
institution. American delegate Harry Dexter White foresaw an IMF that
functioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay
their debts on time. Most of White's plan was incorporated into the final acts
adopted at Bretton Woods. British economist John Maynard Keynes, on the other
hand, imagined that the IMF would be a cooperative fund upon which member
states could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through
periodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and act as
the United States government had during the New Deal to the great depression
of the 1930s.

The IMF formally came into existence on 27 December 1945, when the first 29
countries ratified its Articles of Agreement. By the end of 1946 the IMF had
grown to 39 members. On 1 March 1947, the IMF began its financial operations,
and on 8 May France became the first country to borrow from it.

The IMF was one of the key organizations of the international economic system;
its design allowed the system to balance the rebuilding of international
capitalism with the maximization of national economic sovereignty and human
welfare, also known as embedded liberalism. The IMF's influence in the global
economy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. Its membership
began to expand in the late 1950s and during the 1960s as many African
countries became independent and applied for membership. But the Cold War
limited the Fund's membership, with most countries in the Soviet sphere of
influence not joining until 1970s and 1980s.

The Bretton Woods exchange rate system prevailed until 1971 when the United
States government suspended the convertibility of the US$ (and dollar reserves
held by other governments) into gold. This is known as the Nixon Shock. The
changes to the IMF articles of agreement reflecting these changes were
ratified in 1976 by the Jamaica Accords. Later in the 1970s, large commercial
banks began lending to states because they were awash in cash deposited by oil
exporters. The lending of the so-called money center banks led to the IMF
changing its role in the 1980s after a world recession provoked a crisis that
brought the IMF back into global financial governance.

In the mid-1980s, the IMF shifted its narrow focus from currency stabilization
to a broader focus of promoting market-liberalizing reforms through structural
adjustment programs. This shift occurred without a formal renegotiation of the
organization's charter or operational guidelines. The Ronald Reagan
administration, in particular Treasury Secretary James Baker, his assistant
secretary David Mulford and deputy assistant secretary Charles Dallara,
pressured the IMF to attach market-liberal reforms to the organization's
conditional loans.

During the 20th century, the IMF shifted its position on capital controls.
Whereas the IMF permitted capital controls at its founding and throughout the
1970s, IMF staff increasingly favored free capital movement from 1980s
onwards. This shift happened in the aftermath of an emerging consensus in
economics on the desirability of free capital movement, retirement of IMF
staff hired in the 1940s and 1950s, and the recruitment of staff exposed to
new thinking in economics.

### 21st century

The IMF provided two major lending packages in the early 2000s to Argentina
(during the 1998–2002 Argentine great depression) and Uruguay (after the 2002
Uruguay banking crisis). However, by the mid-2000s, IMF lending was at its
lowest share of world GDP since the 1970s.

In May 2010, the IMF participated, in 3:11 proportion, in the first Greek
bailout that totaled €110 billion, to address the great accumulation of public
debt, caused by continuing large public sector deficits. As part of the
bailout, the Greek government agreed to adopt austerity measures that would
reduce the deficit from 11% in 2009 to "well below 3%" in 2014. The bailout
did not include debt restructuring measures such as a haircut, to the chagrin
of the Swiss, Brazilian, Indian, Russian, and Argentinian Directors of the
IMF, with the Greek authorities themselves (at the time, PM George Papandreou
and Finance Minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou) ruling out a haircut.

A second bailout package of more than €100 billion was agreed upon over the
course of a few months from October 2011, during which time Papandreou was
forced from office. The so-called Troika, of which the IMF is part, are joint
managers of this programme, which was approved by the executive directors of
the IMF on 15 March 2012 for XDR 23.8 billion and saw private bondholders take
a haircut of upwards of 50%. In the interval between May 2010 and February
2012 the private banks of Holland, France, and Germany reduced exposure to
Greek debt from €122 billion to €66 billion.

As of January 2012[update], the largest borrowers from the IMF in order were
Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Romania, and Ukraine.

On 25 March 2013, a €10 billion international bailout of Cyprus was agreed by
the Troika, at the cost to the Cypriots of its agreement: to close the
country's second-largest bank; to impose a one-time bank deposit levy on Bank
of Cyprus uninsured deposits. No insured deposit of €100k or less were to be
affected under the terms of a novel bail-in scheme.

The topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by the IMF in April
2013, for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled "Sovereign Debt
Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and
Policy Framework". The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,
summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and
Jamaica. An explanatory interview with deputy director Hugh Bredenkamp was
published a few days later, as was a deconstruction by Matina Stevis of _The
Wall Street Journal_.

In the October 2013, **Fiscal Monitor** publication, the IMF suggested that a
capital levy capable of reducing Euro-area government debt ratios to "end-2007
levels" would require a very high tax rate of about 10%.

The **Fiscal Affairs** department of the IMF, headed at the time by Acting
Director Sanjeev Gupta, produced a January 2014 report entitled "Fiscal Policy
and Income Inequality" that stated that "Some taxes levied on wealth,
especially on immovable property, are also an option for economies seeking
more progressive taxation ... Property taxes are equitable and efficient, but
underutilized in many economies ... There is considerable scope to exploit
this tax more fully, both as a revenue source and as a redistributive
instrument."

#### Response and analysis of coronavirus

In late 2019, the IMF estimated global growth in 2020 to reach 3.4%, but due
to the coronavirus, in November 2020, it expected the global economy to shrink
by 4.4%.

In March 2020, Kristalina Georgieva announced that the IMF stood ready to
mobilize $1 trillion as its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was in
addition to the $50 billion fund it had announced two weeks earlier, of which
$5 billion had already been requested by Iran. One day earlier on 11 March,
the UK called to pledge £150 million to the IMF catastrophe relief fund. It
came to light on 27 March that "more than 80 poor and middle-income countries"
had sought a bailout due to the coronavirus.

On 13 April 2020, the IMF said that it "would provide immediate debt relief to
25 member countries under its Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT)"
programme.

## Member countries

IMF member states

IMF member states not accepting the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4

Former IMF states/non-participants/no data available

Not all member countries of the IMF are sovereign states, and therefore not
all "member countries" of the IMF are members of the United Nations. Amidst
"member countries" of the IMF that are not member states of the UN are non-
sovereign areas with special jurisdictions that are officially under the
sovereignty of full UN member states, such as Aruba, Curaçao, Hong Kong, and
Macao, as well as Kosovo. The corporate members appoint _ex-officio_ voting
members, who are listed below. All members of the IMF are also International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) members and vice versa.

Former members are Cuba (which left in 1964), and Taiwan, which was ejected
from the IMF in 1980 after losing the support of the then United States
President Jimmy Carter and was replaced by the People's Republic of China.
However, "Taiwan Province of China" is still listed in the official IMF
indices. Poland withdrew in 1950—allegedly pressured by the Soviet Union—but
returned in 1986. The former Czechoslovakia was expelled in 1954 for "failing
to provide required data" and was readmitted in 1990, after the Velvet
Revolution.

Apart from Cuba, the other UN states that do not belong to the IMF are Monaco
and North Korea. Liechtenstein became the 191st member on 21 October 2024.

### Qualifications

Any country may apply to be a part of the IMF. Post-IMF formation, in the
early postwar period, rules for IMF membership were left relatively loose.
Members needed to make periodic membership payments towards their quota, to
refrain from currency restrictions unless granted IMF permission, to abide by
the Code of Conduct in the IMF Articles of Agreement, and to provide national
economic information. However, stricter rules were imposed on governments that
applied to the IMF for funding.

The countries that joined the IMF between 1945 and 1971 agreed to keep their
exchange rates secured at rates that could be adjusted only to correct a
"fundamental disequilibrium" in the balance of payments, and only with the
IMF's agreement.

### Benefits

Member countries of the IMF have access to information on the economic
policies of all member countries, the opportunity to influence other members'
economic policies, technical assistance in banking, fiscal affairs, and
exchange matters, financial support in times of payment difficulties, and
increased opportunities for trade and investment.

### Board of Governors

The board of governors consists of one governor and one alternate governor for
each member country. Each member country appoints its two governors. The Board
normally meets once a year and is responsible for electing or appointing an
executive director to the executive board. While the board of governors is
officially responsible for approving quota increases, special drawing right
allocations, the admittance of new members, compulsory withdrawal of members,
and amendments to the Articles of Agreement and By-Laws, in practice it has
delegated most of its powers to the IMF's executive board.

The board of governors is advised by the International Monetary and Financial
Committee and the Development Committee. The International Monetary and
Financial Committee has 24 members and monitors developments in global
liquidity and the transfer of resources to developing countries. The
Development Committee has 25 members and advises on critical development
issues and on financial resources required to promote economic development in
developing countries.[_citation needed_]

The board of governors reports directly to the managing director of the IMF,
Kristalina Georgieva.

### Executive Board

25 Executive Directors make up the executive board. The executive directors
represent all 191 member countries in a geographically based roster. Countries
with large economies have their own executive director, but most countries are
grouped in constituencies representing four or more countries.

Following the _2008 Amendment on Voice and Participation_ which came into
effect in March 2011, seven countries each appoint an executive director: the
United States, Japan, China, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Saudi
Arabia. The remaining 17 Directors represent constituencies consisting of 2 to
23 countries. This Board usually meets several times each week. The board
membership and constituency is scheduled for periodic review every eight
years.

### Managing Director

The IMF is led by a managing director, who is head of the staff and serves as
chairman of the executive board. The managing director is the most powerful
position at the IMF. Historically, the IMF's managing director has been a
European citizen and the president of the World Bank has been an American
citizen. However, this standard is increasingly being questioned and
competition for these two posts may soon open up to include other qualified
candidates from any part of the world. In August 2019, the International
Monetary Fund has removed the age limit which is 65 or over for its managing
director position.

In 2011, the world's largest developing countries, the BRICS states, issued a
statement declaring that the tradition of appointing a European as managing
director undermined the legitimacy of the IMF and called for the appointment
to be merit-based.

On 28 June 2011, Christine Lagarde was named managing director of the IMF,
replacing Dominique Strauss-Kahn

Former managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn was arrested in connection
with charges of sexually assaulting a New York hotel room attendant and
resigned on 18 May. The charges were later dropped. On 28 June 2011 Christine
Lagarde was confirmed as managing director of the IMF for a five-year term
starting on 5 July 2011. She was re-elected by consensus for a second five-
year term, starting 5 July 2016, being the only candidate nominated for the
post of managing director.

### First Deputy Managing Director

The managing director is assisted by a First Deputy managing director (FDMD)
who, by convention, has always been a citizen of the United States. Together,
the managing director and their First Deputy lead the senior management of the
IMF. Like the managing director, the First Deputy traditionally serves a five-
year term.

### IMF staff

IMF staff have considerable autonomy and are known to shape IMF policy.
According to Jeffrey Chwieroth, "It is the staff members who conduct the bulk
of the IMF's tasks; they formulate policy proposals for consideration by
member states, exercise surveillance, carry out loan negotiations and design
the programs, and collect and systematize detailed information." Most IMF
staff are economists. According to a 1968 study, nearly 60% of staff were from
English-speaking developed countries. By 2004, between 40 and 50% of staff
were from English-speaking developed countries.

A 1996 study found that 90% of new staff with a PhD obtained them from
universities in the United States or Canada. A 1999 study found that none of
the new staff with a PhD obtained their PhD in the Global South.

## Voting power

Voting power in the IMF is based on a quota system. Each member has a number
of **basic votes** , equal to 5.502% of the **total votes** , plus one
additional vote for each special drawing right (SDR) of 100,000 of a member
country's quota. The SDR is the unit of account of the IMF and represents a
potential claim to currency. It is based on a basket of key international
currencies. The basic votes generate a slight bias in favour of small
countries, but the additional votes determined by SDR outweigh this bias.
Changes in the voting shares require approval by a super-majority of 85% of
voting power.

In December 2015, the United States Congress adopted a legislation authorising
the 2010 Quota and Governance Reforms. As a result,

  * all 190 members' quotas will increase from a total of about XDR 238.5 billion to about XDR 477 billion, while the quota shares and voting power of the IMF's poorest member countries will be protected.
  * more than 6 percent of quota shares will shift to dynamic emerging market and developing countries and also from over-represented to under-represented members.
  * four emerging market countries (Brazil, China, India, and Russia) will be among the ten largest members of the IMF. Other top 10 members are the United States, Japan, Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy.

### Effects of the quota system

The IMF's quota system was created to raise funds for loans. Each IMF member
country is assigned a quota, or contribution, that reflects the country's
relative size in the global economy. Each member's quota also determines its
relative voting power. Thus, financial contributions from member governments
are linked to voting power in the organization.

This system follows the logic of a shareholder-controlled organization:
wealthy countries have more say in the making and revision of rules. Since
decision making at the IMF reflects each member's relative economic position
in the world, wealthier countries that provide more money to the IMF have more
influence than poorer members that contribute less; nonetheless, the IMF
focuses on redistribution.

### Inflexibility of voting power

Quotas are normally reviewed every five years and can be increased when deemed
necessary by the board of governors. IMF voting shares are relatively
inflexible: countries that grow economically have tended to become under-
represented as their voting power lags behind. Currently, reforming the
representation of developing countries within the IMF has been suggested.
These countries' economies represent a large portion of the global economic
system but this is not reflected in the IMF's decision-making process through
the nature of the quota system. Joseph Stiglitz argues, "There is a need to
provide more effective voice and representation for developing countries,
which now represent a much larger portion of world economic activity since
1944, when the IMF was created." In 2008, a number of quota reforms were
passed including shifting 6% of quota shares to dynamic emerging markets and
developing countries.

### Overcoming borrower/creditor divide

The IMF's membership is divided along income lines: certain countries provide
financial resources while others use these resources. Both developed country
"creditors" and developing country "borrowers" are members of the IMF. The
developed countries provide the financial resources but rarely enter into IMF
loan agreements; they are the creditors. Conversely, the developing countries
use the lending services but contribute little to the pool of money available
to lend because their quotas are smaller; they are the borrowers. Thus,
tension is created around governance issues because these two groups,
creditors and borrowers, have fundamentally different interests, and low-
income "borrowing" members lack meaningful representation in IMF decision-
making.

The criticism is that the system of voting power distribution through a quota
system institutionalizes borrower subordination and creditor dominance. The
resulting division of the IMF's membership into borrowers and non-borrowers
has increased the controversy around conditionality because the borrowers are
interested in increasing loan access while creditors want to maintain
reassurance that the loans will be repaid.

## Use

In 2008, the SAIS Review of International Affairs revealed that the average
overall use of IMF credit per decade increased, in real terms, by 21% between
the 1970s and 1980s, and increased again by just over 22% from the 1980s to
the 1991–2005 period. Another study has suggested that since 1950 the
continent of Africa alone has received $300 billion from the IMF, the World
Bank, and affiliate institutions.

A study by Bumba Mukherjee found that developing democratic countries benefit
more from IMF programs than developing autocratic countries because policy-
making, and the process of deciding where loaned money is used, is more
transparent within a democracy. One study done by Randall Stone found that
although earlier studies found little impact of IMF programs on balance of
payments, more recent studies using more sophisticated methods and larger
samples "usually found IMF programs improved the balance of payments".

### Exceptional Access Framework – sovereign debt

The Exceptional Access Framework was created in 2003 when John B. Taylor was
Under Secretary of the US Treasury for International Affairs. The new
Framework became fully operational in February 2003 and it was applied in the
subsequent decisions on Argentina and Brazil. Its purpose was to place some
sensible rules and limits on the way the IMF makes loans to support
governments with debt problem—especially in emerging markets—and thereby move
away from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for
ending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. The reform
was closely related to and put in place nearly simultaneously with the actions
of several emerging market countries to place collective action clauses in
their bond contracts.

In 2010, the framework was abandoned so the IMF could make loans to Greece in
an unsustainable and political situation.

The topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by IMF staff in April
2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled "Sovereign Debt
Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and
Policy Framework". The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,
summarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and
Jamaica. An explanatory interview with deputy director Hugh Bredenkamp was
published a few days later, as was a deconstruction by Matina Stevis of _The
Wall Street Journal_.

The staff was directed to formulate an updated policy, which was accomplished
on 22 May 2014 with a report entitled "The Fund's Lending Framework and
Sovereign Debt: Preliminary Considerations", and taken up by the executive
board on 13 June. The staff proposed that "in circumstances where a
(Sovereign) member has lost market access and debt is considered sustainable
... the IMF would be able to provide Exceptional Access on the basis of a debt
operation that involves an extension of maturities", which was labeled a
"reprofiling operation". These reprofiling operations would "generally be less
costly to the debtor and creditors—and thus to the system overall—relative to
either an upfront debt reduction operation or a bail-out that is followed by
debt reduction ... (and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has
lost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with
high probability ... Creditors will only agree if they understand that such an
amendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an
operation involving debt reduction ... Collective action clauses, which now
exist in most—but not all—bonds would be relied upon to address collective
action problems."

## Impact

According to a 2002 study by Randall W. Stone, the academic literature on the
IMF shows "no consensus on the long-term effects of IMF programs on growth".

Some research has found that IMF loans can reduce the chance of a future
banking crisis, while other studies have found that they can increase the risk
of political crises. IMF programs can reduce the effects of a currency crisis.

Some research has found that IMF programs are less effective in countries
which possess a developed-country patron (be it by foreign aid, membership of
postcolonial institutions or UN voting patterns), seemingly due to this patron
allowing countries to flaunt IMF program rules as these rules are not
consistently enforced. Some research has found that IMF loans reduce economic
growth due to creating an economic moral hazard, reducing public investment,
reducing incentives to create a robust domestic policies and reducing private
investor confidence. Other research has indicated that IMF loans can have a
positive impact on economic growth and that their effects are highly nuanced.

## Criticisms

### General

Anarchist protest against the IMF and corporate bailout in April 2009

Overseas Development Institute (ODI) research undertaken in 1980 included
criticisms of the IMF which support the analysis that it is a pillar of what
activist Titus Alexander calls global apartheid.

  * Developed countries were seen to have a more dominant role and control over less developed countries (LDCs).
  * The Fund worked on the incorrect assumption that all payments disequilibria were caused domestically. The Group of 24 (G-24), on behalf of LDC members, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) complained that the IMF did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. This criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. Then LDCs found themselves with payment deficits due to adverse changes in their terms of trade, with the Fund prescribing stabilization programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. Faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the G-24 argued for more time for LDCs to adjust their economies.
  * Some IMF policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that deflationary effects of IMF programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. Moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor.
  * The IMF's initial policies were based in theory and influenced by differing opinions and departmental rivalries. Critics suggest that its intentions to implement these policies in countries with widely varying economic circumstances were misinformed and lacked economic rationale.

ODI conclusions were that the IMF's very nature of promoting market-oriented
approaches attracted unavoidable criticism. On the other hand, the IMF could
serve as a scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international
bankers. The ODI conceded that the IMF was insensitive to political
aspirations of LDCs while its policy conditions were inflexible.

Argentina, which had been considered by the IMF to be a model country in its
compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced
a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused
by IMF-induced budget restrictions—which undercut the government's ability to
sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health,
education, and security—and privatisation of strategically vital national
resources. Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal
federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly. The crisis
added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South
American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic
problems. The post-2000s trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the
region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic
policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this
crisis.[_citation needed_]

In 2001, the Independent Evaluation Office, an autonomous body, was
established to conduct independent evaluations of policies and activities of
the International Monetary Fund.

In 2006, a senior ActionAid policy analyst Akanksha Marphatia stated that IMF
policies in Africa undermine any possibility of meeting the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) due to imposed restrictions that prevent spending on
important sectors, such as education and health.

In an interview (2008-05-19), the former Romanian Prime Minister Călin
Popescu-Tăriceanu claimed that "Since 2005, IMF is constantly making mistakes
when it appreciates the country's economic performances". Former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere, who claimed that debt-ridden African states were
ceding sovereignty to the IMF and the World Bank, famously asked, "Who elected
the IMF to be the ministry of finance for every country in the world?"

Former chief economist of IMF and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor
Raghuram Rajan who predicted the 2008 financial crisis criticised the IMF for
remaining a sideline player to the developed world. He criticised the IMF for
praising the monetary policies of the US, which he believed were wreaking
havoc in emerging markets. He had been critical of "ultra-loose money
policies" of some unnamed countries.

Countries such as Zambia have not received proper aid with long-lasting
effects, leading to concern from economists. Since 2005, Zambia (as well as 29
other African countries) did receive debt write-offs, which helped with the
country's medical and education funds. However, Zambia returned to a debt of
over half its GDP in less than a decade. American economist William Easterly,
sceptical of the IMF's methods, had initially warned that "debt relief would
simply encourage more reckless borrowing by crooked governments unless it was
accompanied by reforms to speed up economic growth and improve governance",
according to _The Economist_.

### Conditionality

The IMF has been criticised for being "out of touch" with local economic
conditions, cultures, and environments in the countries they are requiring
policy reform. The economic advice the IMF gives might not always take into
consideration the difference between what spending means on paper and how it
is felt by citizens. Countries charge that with excessive conditionality, they
do not "own" the programmes and the links are broken between a recipient
country's people, its government, and the goals being pursued by the IMF.

Jeffrey Sachs argues that the IMF's "usual prescription is 'budgetary belt
tightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts'". Sachs wrote that
the IMF's role as a generalist institution specialising in macroeconomic
issues needs reform. Conditionality has also been criticised because a country
can pledge collateral of "acceptable assets" to obtain waivers—if one assumes
that all countries are able to provide "acceptable collateral".

One view is that conditionality undermines domestic political institutions.
The recipient governments are sacrificing policy autonomy in exchange for
funds, which can lead to public resentment of the local leadership for
accepting and enforcing the IMF conditions. Political instability can result
from more leadership turnover as political leaders are replaced in electoral
backlashes. IMF conditions are often criticised for reducing government
services, thus increasing unemployment.

Another criticism is that IMF policies are only designed to address poor
governance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention
in markets, and too much state ownership. This assumes that this narrow range
of issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised
and differing contexts are ignored. A country may also be compelled to accept
conditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial
crisis in need of assistance.

On top of that, regardless of what methodologies and data sets used, it comes
to same the conclusion of exacerbating income inequality. With Gini
coefficient, it became clear that countries with IMF policies face increased
income inequality.

It is claimed that conditionalities hinder social stability and hence inhibit
the stated goals of the IMF, while Structural Adjustment Programmes lead to an
increase in poverty in recipient countries. The IMF sometimes advocates
"austerity programmes", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when
the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing
budget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax
rate. In _Globalization and Its Discontents_ , Joseph E. Stiglitz, former
chief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these
policies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the
purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds
for countries to carry out Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF "was not
participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and
ideology of the Western financial community."

Stiglitz concludes, "Modern high-tech warfare is designed to remove physical
contact: dropping bombs from 50,000 feet ensures that one does not 'feel' what
one does. Modern economic management is similar: from one's luxury hotel, one
can callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew
the people whose lives one was destroying."

The researchers Eric Toussaint and Damien Millet argue that the IMF's policies
amount to a new form of colonisation that does not need a military presence:

> Following the exigencies of the governments of the richest companies, the
> IMF, permitted countries in crisis to borrow in order to avoid default on
> their repayments. Caught in the debt's downward spiral, developing countries
> soon had no other recourse than to take on new debt in order to repay the
> old debt. Before providing them with new loans, at higher interest rates,
> future leaders asked the IMF, to intervene with the guarantee of ulterior
> reimbursement, asking for a signed agreement with the said countries. The
> IMF thus agreed to restart the flow of the 'finance pump' on condition that
> the concerned countries first use this money to reimburse banks and other
> private lenders, while restructuring their economy at the IMF's discretion:
> these were the famous conditionalities, detailed in the Structural
> Adjustment Programmes. The IMF and its ultra-liberal experts took control of
> the borrowing countries' economic policies. A new form of colonisation was
> thus instituted. It was not even necessary to establish an administrative or
> military presence; the debt alone maintained this new form of submission.

International politics play an important role in IMF decision making. The
clout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF
finances. The United States has the greatest number of votes and therefore
wields the most influence. Domestic politics often come into play, with
politicians in developing countries using conditionality to gain leverage over
the opposition to influence policy.

Academic Jeremy Garlick cites IMF loans to South Korea during the 1997 Asian
financial crisis as widely perceived by the South Korean public as a debt-
trap. Garlick writes that the public was generally bitter about submitting to
the conditions imposed by the IMF, which required South Korea to radically
restructure its economy and consult with the IMF before making economic
decisions until the debt was repaid.

In 2016, the IMF's research department published a report titled
"Neoliberalism: Oversold?" which, while praising some aspects of the
"neoliberal agenda", claims that the organisation has been "overselling"
fiscal austerity policies and financial deregulation, which they claim has
exacerbated both financial crises and economic inequality around the world.

In 2020 and 2021, Oxfam criticized the IMF for forcing tough austerity
measures on many low income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite
forcing cuts to healthcare spending, would hamper the recipient's response to
the pandemic.

### Support of dictatorships

The role of the Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial since the
late Cold War, because of claims that the IMF policy makers supported military
dictatorships friendly to American and European corporations, but also other
anti-communist and communist regimes, such as the Socialist Republic of
Romania. An example of IMF's support for a dictatorship was its ongoing
support for Mobutu's rule in Zaire, although its own envoy Erwin Blumenthal
provided a sobering report about the entrenched corruption and embezzlement
and the inability of the country to pay back any loans. In 2021, the IMF
approved a US$1 billion loan to the autocratic Uganda despite protests from
Ugandans in Washington, London and South Africa. Critics also claim that the
IMF is generally apathetic or hostile to democracy, human rights, and labour
rights. The controversy has helped spark the anti-globalization movement.

Arguments in favour of the IMF supporting dictatorships is the claim that
economic stability is a precursor to democracy. A 2017 study found no evidence
of IMF lending programs undermining democracy in borrowing countries, it found
"evidence for modest but definitively positive conditional differences in the
democracy scores of participating and non-participating countries".

A 2020 study found the reverse causality with democracy as a precursor to
economic stability. Critics highlight various examples in which democratised
countries fell after receiving IMF loans.

Party-based autocracies and democracies can face similar incentives when
considering agreements with IMF, in contrast to personalist and military
regimes.

### Impact on access to food

A number of civil society organisations have criticised the IMF's policies for
their impact on access to food, particularly in developing countries. In
October 2008, former United States president Bill Clinton delivered a speech
to the United Nations on World Food Day, criticising the World Bank and IMF
for their policies on food and agriculture:

> We need the World Bank, the IMF, all the big foundations, and all the
> governments to admit that, for 30 years, we all blew it, including me when I
> was president. We were wrong to believe that food was like some other
> product in international trade, and we all have to go back to a more
> responsible and sustainable form of agriculture.

— Former U.S. president Bill Clinton, Speech at United Nations World Food Day,
October 16, 2008

The FPIF remarked that there is a recurring pattern: "the destabilization of
peasant producers by a one-two punch of IMF-World Bank structural adjustment
programs that gutted government investment in the countryside followed by the
massive influx of subsidized U.S. and European Union agricultural imports
after the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture pried open markets."

### Impact on public health

A 2009 study concluded that the strict conditions resulted in thousands of
deaths in Eastern Europe by tuberculosis as public health care had to be
weakened. In the 21 countries to which the IMF had given loans, tuberculosis
deaths rose by 16.6%. A 2017 systematic review on studies conducted on the
impact that structural adjustment programs have on child and maternal health
found that these programs have a detrimental effect on maternal and child
health among other adverse effects.

### Reform

#### Function and policies

The IMF is only one of many international organisations, and it is a
generalist institution that deals only with macroeconomic issues; its core
areas of concern in developing countries are very narrow. One proposed reform
is a movement towards close partnership with other specialist agencies such as
UNICEF, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP).

Jeffrey Sachs argues in _The End of Poverty_ that the IMF and the World Bank
have "the brightest economists and the lead in advising poor countries on how
to break out of poverty, but the problem is development economics".
Development economics needs the reform, not the IMF. He also notes that IMF
loan conditions should be paired with other reforms—e.g., trade reform in
developed nations, debt cancellation, and increased financial assistance for
investments in basic infrastructure. IMF loan conditions cannot stand alone
and produce change; they need to be partnered with other reforms or other
conditions as applicable.

#### U.S. influence and voting reform

The scholarly consensus is that IMF decision-making is not simply
technocratic, but also guided by political and economic concerns. The United
States is the IMF's most powerful member, and its influence reaches even into
decision-making concerning individual loan agreements. The U.S. has
historically been openly opposed to losing what Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew
described in 2015 as its "leadership role" at the IMF, and the U.S.' "ability
to shape international norms and practices".

Emerging markets were not well-represented for most of the IMF's history:
Despite being the most populous country, China's vote share was the sixth
largest; Brazil's vote share was smaller than Belgium's. Reforms to give more
powers to emerging economies were agreed by the G20 in 2010. The reforms could
not pass, however, until they were ratified by the United States Congress,
since 85% of the Fund's voting power was required for the reforms to take
effect, and the Americans held more than 16% of voting power at the time.
After repeated criticism, the U.S. finally ratified the voting reforms at the
end of 2015. The OECD countries maintained their overwhelming majority of
voting share, and the U.S. in particular retained its share at over 16%.

The criticism of the American- and European-dominated IMF has led to what some
consider "disenfranchising the world" from the governance of the IMF. Raúl
Prebisch, the founding secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and
Development (UNCTAD), wrote that one of "the conspicuous deficiencies of the
general economic theory, from the point of view of the periphery, is its false
sense of universality".

## IMF and globalization

Globalization encompasses three institutions: global financial markets and
transnational companies, national governments linked to each other in economic
and military alliances led by the United States, and rising "global
governments" such as World Trade Organization (WTO), IMF, and World Bank.
Charles Derber argues in his book _People Before Profit,_ "These interacting
institutions create a new global power system where sovereignty is globalized,
taking power and constitutional authority away from nations and giving it to
global markets and international bodies". Titus Alexander argues that this
system institutionalises global inequality between western countries and the
Majority World in a form of global apartheid, in which the IMF is a key
pillar.

The establishment of globalised economic institutions has been both a symptom
of and a stimulus for globalisation. The development of the World Bank, the
IMF, regional development banks such as the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD), and multilateral trade institutions such as the WTO
signals a move away from the dominance of the state as the primary actor
analysed in international affairs. Globalization has thus been transformative
in terms of limiting of state sovereignty over the economy.

### International central bank digital currency

In April 2023, the IMF launched their international central bank digital
currency through their Digital Currency Monetary Authority, it will be called
the Universal Monetary Unit, or Units for shorthand. The ANSI character will
be Ü and will be used to facilitate international banking and international
trade between countries and currencies. It will help facilitate SWIFT
transactions on cross border transactions at wholesale FX rates
instantaneously with real-time settlements. In June, it announced it was
working on a platform for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that would
enable transactions between nations. IMF Managing Director Kristalina
Georgieva said that if central banks did not agree on a common platform,
cryptocurrency would fill the resulting vacuum.

## Scandals

Managing Director Lagarde (2011–2019) was convicted of giving preferential
treatment to businessman-turned-politician Bernard Tapie as he pursued a legal
challenge against the French government. At the time, Lagarde was the French
economic minister. Within hours of her conviction, in which she escaped any
punishment, the fund's 24-member executive board put to rest any speculation
that she might have to resign, praising her "outstanding leadership" and the
"wide respect" she commands around the world.

Former IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato was arrested in 2015 for alleged
fraud, embezzlement and money laundering. In 2017, the Audiencia Nacional
found Rato guilty of embezzlement and sentenced him to 4+1⁄2 years'
imprisonment. In 2018, the sentence was confirmed by the Supreme Court of
Spain.

## Alternatives

In March 2011, the Ministers of Economy and Finance of the African Union
proposed to establish an African Monetary Fund.

At the 6th BRICS summit in July 2014 the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India,
China, and South Africa) announced the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement
with an initial size of US$100 billion, a framework to provide liquidity
through currency swaps in response to actual or potential short-term balance-
of-payments pressures.

In 2014, the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was established.

## In the media

_Life and Debt_ , a documentary film, deals with the IMF's policies' influence
on Jamaica and its economy from a critical point of view. _Debtocracy_ , a
2011 independent Greek documentary film, also criticises the IMF. Portuguese
musician José Mário Branco's 1982 album _FMI [pt]_ is inspired by the IMF's
intervention in Portugal through monitored stabilisation programs in 1977–78.
In the 2015 film _Our Brand Is Crisis_ , the IMF is mentioned as a point of
political contention, where the Bolivian population fears its electoral
interference.
