Map showing the member states of the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific

The **United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific**
(**ESCAP** or **UNESCAP**) is one of the five regional commissions under the
jurisdiction of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It was
established in order to increase economic activity in Asia and the Far East,
as well as to foster economic relations between the region and other areas of
the world.

The commission is composed of 53 member states and nine associate members,
mostly from the Asia and Pacific regions. In addition to countries in Asia and
the Pacific, the commission's members includes France, the Netherlands, the
United Kingdom and the United States.

The region covered by the commission is home to 4.1 billion people, or two-
thirds of the world's population, making ESCAP the most comprehensive of the
United Nations' five regional commissions.

## History

The commission was first established by the Economic and Social Council on 28
March 1947 as the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East
(ECAFE) to assist in post-war economic reconstruction. Its main mandate was to
"initiate and participate in measures for facilitating concerted action for
the economic reconstruction and development of Asia and the Far East."

On 1 August 1974, the commission was renamed to the Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) by the Economic and Social Council
to reflect both the economic and social aspects of the Commission's work, as
well as geographic location of its members.

## Themes and programmes

### Implementing Sustainable Development Goals

The road map of ESCAP on coherent implementation of the Sustainable
Development Goals has not prioritized specific SDGs, but rather it has
identified priority areas. Third-party consultations have fed into this road
map, which also aimed to activate third parties, such as UN funds, specialized
agencies, and regional organizations, to provide more support to Member
States. The commission furthermore engages with other regional actors to link
their agendas to the SDGs. One example is the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) _Community Vision 2025_. However, regional agendas outside the
SDG framework are continually evolving, as exemplified by the new ASEAN
Recovery Framework and ASEAN’s Vision 2040.

ESCAP has also established novel tools to structure its support to its member
states and others. Examples include ESCAP’s _SDG Rapid Response_ facility,
used for individual and shared support requests, and its _SDG Helpdesk_ ,
which offers a platform with tools, knowledge products, expertise, good
practices, advice, opportunities for peer learning, and regional South-South
Cooperation. ESCAP also seeks to create interaction between debtors and
creditors with a focus on the small island states in the Pacific. To date,
this has been done through a Regional Debt Conference, rather than some more
permanent tool.
