Organization of 9 developing Muslim-majority Countries

The **D-8 Organization for Economic Cooperation** , also known as
**Developing-8** , is an organisation for development co-operation among
Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Turkey.
Azerbaijan was admitted to the organization as the 9th member on 19 December
2024.

The combined population of the nine countries is more than 1.28 billion or 63%
of all Muslims, or close to 16% of the world's population and covering an area
of 7.62 million square kilometres, 5% of world land area. In **2016** , trade
between the D-8 member states stood at approximately **$65 billion** , showing
substantial growth since its inception. By **2020** , this figure increased to
around **$133 billion** , reflecting the enhanced economic cooperation and
integration among member countries. In 2024, the total nominal GDP of the
eight nations reached approximately **$5.1 trillion** , underscoring their
collective economic significance. Transactions among these countries accounted
for an increasing share of global trade as they continue to pursue ambitious
goals, such as reaching a trade value of **$500 billion** by 2030 under the
D-8 Decennial Road map. This plan also focuses on expanding sectoral
cooperation in areas like agriculture, energy, and transportation, fostering
sustainable development across the member states.[_citation needed_]

## Purposes and objectives

The main areas of co-operation include finance, banking, rural development,
science and technology, humanitarian development, agriculture, energy,
environment, and health.

In the first Summit Declaration (Istanbul, 1997), the main objective of D-8 is
stated to be socio-economic development in accordance with the following
principles:

  * Peace instead of conflict.
  * Dialogue instead of confrontation.
  * Cooperation instead of exploitation.
  * Justice instead of double standard.
  * Equality instead of discrimination.
  * Democracy instead of oppression.

The fifth D-8 Summit Declaration (Bali, 2006) produced the following, as
illustration of the application of the group's objectives:

  * Commitment to work together to solve the problem of economic disparities within our countries.
  * Reaffirm commitment to enhance co-operation in the field of energy to develop alternative and renewable energy resources.
  * Emphasize the importance of D-8 in contributing to the economic development of its member countries and ensure that it promotes global trade.
