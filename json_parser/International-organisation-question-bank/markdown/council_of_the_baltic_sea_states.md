## History

The CBSS was established by the region's Foreign Ministers in Copenhagen in
March 1992 as a response to the geopolitical changes that took place in the
Baltic Sea region with the end of the Cold War. The CBSS founders were Hans-
Dietrich Genscher, Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Thorvald Stoltenberg, Lennart Meri,
Jānis Jurkāns, Algirdas Saudargas, Henning Christophersen, Paavo Väyrynen,
Andrei Kozyrev, Margaretha af Ugglas, and Krzysztof Skubiszewski. Since its
founding, the CBSS has contributed to ensuring positive developments within
the Baltic Sea region and has served as a driving force for multilateral
cooperation.

Since 1998 the CBSS has been served by a permanent international Secretariat
that is located in Stockholm, Sweden and funded by the Member States. The
highest institution of CBSS is the conference of foreign ministers, which
convenes once per year.

On 3 March 2022, a declaration from 11 members of the CBSS suspended Russia
from the Council's activities with immediate effect as a result of 2022
Russian invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Belarus, with observer status, was
suspended from participating in CBSS activities.

### Presidencies

The Council Presidency rotates between the ten Member States on an annual
basis. The European Union does not hold the Presidency. Each Presidency lays
down a set of specific priorities to guide the works of the Council for the

## Structure

### Committee of Senior Officials

The Committee of Senior Officials (CSO) consists of high-ranking
representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the ten CBSS Member
States as well as of a high-level representative of the European Union. The
CSO serves as the main discussion forum and decision-making body for matters
related to the work of the Council between Ministerial Sessions. The CSO
monitors, facilitates and aims to coordinate the work of all CBSS structures.

The period chaired by each country rotates on an annual basis and follows the
Council Presidency. The CSO Chairman is a representative, usually at
ambassadorial level, appointed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the
country which holds the Council Presidency.

A number of CBSS structures are operating under the auspices of the CSO.

The CSO monitors the work of the Expert Groups and coordinates the work
undertaken in the agreed three long-term priorities 'Regional Identity',
'Sustainable & Prosperous Region' and 'Safe & Secure Region'.

### Expert Groups

  * CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Maritime Economy
  * CBSS Expert Group on Children at Risk
  * CBSS Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings

The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development, which managed the Baltic
2030 Action Plan, ceased its operations in 2023.

### Secretariat

A Permanent International Secretariat of the CBSS was established following a
decision taken at the 7th Ministerial Session of the CBSS in 1998 in Nyborg,
Denmark. The Secretariat was officially inaugurated at its premises on the
island of Strömsborg in Stockholm on 20 October 1998. From November 2010 until
July 2020 the Secretariat was located at Räntmästarhuset at Slussplan 9,
Stockholm, Sweden. Since July 2020, Momma Reenstiernas Palace at Wollmar
Yxkullsgatan 23 is the new home of the CBSS Secretariat.

The mandate of the Secretariat is as follows:

  * to provide technical and organisational support to the Chairman of the CBSS and the structures and working bodies of the Council;
  * to ensure continuity and enhanced coordination of CBSS activities;
  * to implement the CBSS Information and Communication Strategy;
  * to maintain the CBSS archives and information database;
  * to maintain contacts with other organisations operating in and around the Baltic Sea region, the national authorities of Member States and the media.

### Strategic partners

Since the 10th Ministerial Session of the CBSS in 2001, the Council has
intensified efforts to coordinate CBSS activities with other organisations
actively working to advance regional cooperation in the Baltic Sea Region. The
CBSS has taken the initiative to organise annual coordination meetings,
(organised and presided over by the CSO Chair), with the participation of
Baltic Sea regional organisations, thus providing a more structured channel
for involving the strategic partners to voice their concerns and coordinate
their efforts with the CBSS and other organisations such as:

  * B7 Baltic Seven Islands
  * BASTUN
  * BCCA
  * Baltic Sea Forum
  * BSPC
  * BSRUN
  * BSSSC
  * BUP
  * Business Advisory Council
  * CPMR
  * HELCOM
  * IOM
  * NGO Forum
  * OECD
  * ScanBalt
  * UBC
