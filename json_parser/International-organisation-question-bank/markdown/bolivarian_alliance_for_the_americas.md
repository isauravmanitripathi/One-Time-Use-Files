Intergovernmental organization of Latin American and Caribbean states

**ALBA** or **ALBA–TCP** , formally the **Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples
of Our America** (Spanish: _Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra
América_) or the **Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America –
Peoples' Trade Treaty** (Spanish: _Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de
Nuestra América – Tratado de Comercio de los Pueblos_), is an
intergovernmental organization based on the idea of political and economic
integration of Latin American and Caribbean countries.

Founded initially by Cuba and Venezuela in 2004, it is associated with
socialist and social democratic governments wishing to consolidate regional
economic integration based on a vision of social welfare, bartering and mutual
economic aid. The ten member countries are Antigua and Barbuda, Bolivia, Cuba,
Dominica, Grenada, Nicaragua, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint
Vincent and the Grenadines and Venezuela. Suriname was admitted to ALBA as a
guest country at a February 2012 summit.

## History

Late Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, founder of ALBA

The agreement was proposed by the government of Venezuela, led by Hugo Chávez
as an alternative to the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA or ALCA in
Spanish, an agreement proposed by the United States), which never
materialized.[_citation needed_]

This Cuba–Venezuela Agreement, signed on 14 December 2004, by Presidents
Chávez and Fidel Castro, was aimed at the exchange of medical and educational
resources and petroleum between the two nations. Venezuela began to deliver
about 96,000 barrels of oil per day from its state-owned oil company, PDVSA,
to Cuba at very favorable prices. In exchange, Cuba sent 20,000 state-employed
medical staff and thousands of teachers to Venezuela's poorest states. The
agreement also made it possible for Venezuelans to travel to Cuba for
specialized medical care, free of charge.[_self-published source?_]

When it was launched in 2004, ALBA had only two member states, Venezuela and
Cuba. Subsequently, a number of other Latin American and Caribbean nations
entered into this 'Peoples' Trade Agreement' (Spanish: _Tratado de Comercio de
los Pueblos_ , or TCP), which aims to implement the principles of ALBA.
Bolivia under Evo Morales joined in 2006, Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega in
2007, and Ecuador under Rafael Correa in 2009. Honduras, under Manuel Zelaya,
joined in 2008, but withdrew in 2010 after the 2009 Honduran coup d'état. The
Caribbean nations Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the
Grenadines and Saint Lucia also joined.

Jamaica, at the invitation of Chávez, and Mexico, at the invitation of Ortega,
were invited to join the ALBA countries. Chávez also invited the countries of
Central America to join ALBA, and invited Argentina to use SUCRE. In the 11th
Summit of ALBA in February 2012, Suriname, Saint Lucia and Haiti requested
admission to the organization. Haiti was granted the special status of
permanent member and the other two countries were named special members, while
awaiting their full incorporation.

In July 2013, Chávez was honored posthumously by the nine member countries of
the group and special guests Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana and
Haiti at the group's 12th Presidential Summit in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

In December 2014, Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis were accepted as full
members during the 13th Summit of the Alliance, which occurred in Havana,
Cuba.

Ecuador withdrew from ALBA in August 2018. Bolivia's interim government
withdrew in November 2019 during the political crisis, but the newly elected
government of Luis Arce rejoined following the 2020 Bolivian general election.

Amid the international isolation Russia is facing due to the invasion of
Ukraine, ALBA invited Russia to participate at the 2023 ALBA Games.

### Virtual currency

In October 2009, ALBA leaders agreed at a summit in Bolivia to create a
virtual currency, named the SUCRE. "The document is approved," said Bolivian
President Evo Morales, the summit host. President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez
announced "The sucre [is] an autonomous and sovereign monetary system that
will be agreed upon today so that it can be implemented in 2010." As of 2015,
the virtual currency is being used to compensate trade between Bolivia, Cuba,
Nicaragua, and especially Ecuador and Venezuela.

XIV ALBA-TCP summit, 2017

### PetroCaribe

Based on the earlier San José Accords (1980) and Caracas Energy Accords (2000)
between Venezuela and a number of Caribbean states, Petrocaribe was founded in
2005 to facilitate oil trade under a concessionary financial agreement. The
initiative has provided the Caribbean member states with important hydrocarbon
resources, which many do not possess on their territories, in exchange for
services and goods. In the case of Cuba, a nation largely deprived of oil
since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Petrocaribe has provided oil in
exchange for medical doctors.

### Other energy initiatives

As part of Cuba's efforts to spread its Energy Revolution campaign through
ALBA, Cuban social workers traveled to 11 countries in the Caribbean and Latin
America to help develop energy efficiency projects in those countries.

### TeleSUR

Launched in 2005, TeleSUR is a media network that provides news and current
affairs broadcasts throughout the ALBA bloc. The network has an internet based
television channel and is a cooperative effort between the governments of
Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.

### PETROSUR

PETROSUR is an inter-governmental energy alliance between Venezuelan PDVSA,
Argentinean YPF, and Brazilian Petrobras nationalized oil companies. The goal
of this initiative is to provide funding for social welfare programs within
these nations.[_citation needed_]

## ALBA at the UNFCCC

AlBA also speaks on behalf of its member states, if they find a common
position in intergovernmental meetings of the UNFCCC.

## Criticism

In July 2018, President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador distanced himself from ALBA,
stating that the organization "has not worked for a while." In August 2018,
Ecuador officially withdrew from ALBA.[_citation needed_]

Karen Longaric, appointed as foreign minister by Jeanine Áñez's interim
government, announced the formal departure of the country from ALBA in
November 2019 over "interference" in Bolivia's political crisis. Bolivia
remained in ALBA after the Áñez government was defeated in the 2020 Bolivian
general election.[_citation needed_]
