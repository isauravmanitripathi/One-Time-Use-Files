The **Central American Integration System** (Spanish: _**Sistema de la
Integración Centroamericana**_ , or **SICA**) has been the economic and
political organization of Central American states since 1 February 1993. On 13
December 1991, the ODECA countries (Spanish: _Organización de Estados
Centroamericanos_) signed the Protocol of Tegucigalpa, extending earlier
cooperation for regional peace, political freedom, democracy and economic
development. SICA's General Secretariat is in El Salvador.

In 1991, SICA's institutional framework included Guatemala, El Salvador,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. Belize joined in 1998 as a full
member, while the Dominican Republic became an associated state in 2004 and a
full member in 2013. Mexico, Chile and Brazil became part of the organization
as regional observers, and the Republic of China, Spain, Germany, Georgia and
Japan became extra-regional observers. SICA has a standing invitation to
participate as observers in sessions of the United Nations General Assembly,
and maintains offices at UN Headquarters.

Four countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua) experiencing
political, cultural and migratory integration have formed a group, the Central
America Four or CA-4, which has introduced common internal borders and the
same type of passport. Belize, Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic
subsequently joined the CA-4 for economic integration.

## History

### First Central American Court of Justice

Between 14 November and 20 December 1907, after a proposal by Mexico and the
United States, five Central American nations (Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua) took part in the Central American Peace
Conference in Washington, D.C. sponsored by United States Secretary of State
Elihu Root. The five nations, all former Spanish colonies, had previously
tried to form a political alliance. Their first attempt was the Federal
Republic of Central America, and the most recent effort was the founding of
the Republic of Central America 11 years earlier.

The participants concluded the conference with an agreement creating the
Central American Court of Justice _(Corte de Justicia Centroamericana)_. The
court would remain in effect for ten years from the final ratification, and
communication would be through the government of Costa Rica. It was composed
of five judges, one from each member state. The court heard ten cases, five of
which were brought by private individuals (and declared inadmissible) and
three begun by the court. The court operated until April 1918 from its
headquarters in Costa Rica; despite efforts beginning in March 1917 (when
Nicaragua submitted a notice of termination of the agreement), it then
dissolved.

Reasons for the agreement's failure include:

  * No effective system of judicial procedure
  * Judges were not independent of their respective governments.
  * Jurisdiction was too broad to satisfy its member states.[_citation needed_]

Integration System. Considering them, the total area reaches 2 351 224 km².

### Organization of Central American States

At the end of World War II, interest in integrating the Central American
governments began. On 14 October 1951 (33 years after the CACJ was dissolved)
the governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua
signed a treaty creating the Organization of Central American States
_(Organización de Estados Centroamericanos_ , or ODECA) to promote regional
cooperation and unity. The following year (12 December 1952), ODECA's charter
was amended to create a new Central American Court of Justice (_Corte
Centroamericana de Justicia_ , or CCJ) without the time limit of its previous
incarnation.

The Charter of San Salvador was ratified by all Central American governments,
and on 18 August 1955 their foreign ministers attended its first meeting in
Antigua Guatemala. The Declaration of Antigua Guatemala authorized subordinate
organizations of ODECA to facilitate economic cooperation, better sanitation
and progress in the "integral union" of the Central American nations.

The Central American Common Market, the Central American Bank for Economic
Integration (BCIE) and the Secretariat for Central American Economic
Integration (SIECA) were established by the five Central American nations on
13 December 1960 at a conference in Managua. All nations ratified the
membership treaties the following year. Costa Rica joined the CACM in 1963,
but Panama had not yet joined. The organization froze during the 1969 war
between Honduras and El Salvador; in 1973 ODECA was suspended, and progress
toward regional integration ground to a halt.

### Revival

In 1991 the integration agenda advanced with the creation of the SICA, which
provided a legal framework to resolve disputes between member states. SICA was
supported by the United Nations General Assembly in a resolution of 20
December 1993. SICA includes seven Central America nations and the Dominican
Republic, which is part of the Caribbean. Central America has several
supranational institutions, such as the Central American Parliament, the
Central American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common
Market. The Central America trade bloc is governed by the General Treaty for
Economical Integration (the Guatemala Protocol), which was signed on 29
October 1993. The CACM has removed duties on most products throughout the
member countries, and has unified external tariffs and increased trade within
its members. The bank has five non-regional members: Argentina, Colombia,
Mexico, the Republic of China and Spain.

All SICA members are also part of the Mesoamerica Project, which includes
Mexico and Colombia. Haiti admitted to join SICA in 2013 as a regional
observer[_citation needed_] and the Dominican Republic became a full member on
27 June 2013.

### Expulsions and rejections

Guatemala, Panama, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica appealed SICA to expel
Nicaragua from SICA membership and reject admission of Russia as a SICA extra-
regional observer due to Daniel Ortega regime's support for Russia during the
ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war since 2014.

## Economic integration

### Unified Central American currency

The Central American Bank for Economic Integration has not introduced its own
common currency, and dollarization is possible. However, for formal purposes
the US Dollar is sometimes referred to as "Central American Peso" pegged 1:1
to the Dollar. There are no coins or notes in this currency and it is little
known outside of legal circles. Central America is increasing its regional
economic development, accelerating its social, political and economic
integration. The region has diversified output and price and wage flexibility;
however, there is a lack of business-cycle synchronization, dissimilar levels
of public-sector debt, diverging inflation rates and low levels of intra-
regional trade.

## Policy integration

In the parliamentary body are proposals to consider regional air travel as
domestic travel, to eliminate roaming fees on telephone calls and to create a
regional penitentiary (affiliated with the Central American Court of Justice)
to address regional trafficking and international crimes.

## Headquarters

SICA's administrative centre is located in San Salvador, El Salvador.

## Institutions

### Central American Parliament

Parlacen was born as a parliamentary body emulating the Federal Republic of
Central America, with Costa Rica an observer. It evolved from the Contadora
Group, a project launched during the 1980s to deal with civil wars in El
Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Although the Contadora Group was dissolved
in 1986, the concept of Central American integration is implicitly referenced
in several countries' constitutions. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement (among
other acts) agreed to the creation of a Central American Parliament composed
of 20–22 directly-elected deputies from each country. Costa Rica has not
ratified the agreement, and is not represented in the Parlacen. Parlacen is
seen by some (including former President of Honduras Ricardo Maduro) as a
white elephant.

### Central American Court of Justice

The CCJ's mission is to promote peace in the region and the unity of its
member states. The Court has jurisdiction to hear cases:

  * Between member states
  * Between a member state and a non-member state accepting the court's jurisdiction
  * Between states and a resident of a member state
  * Concerning the integration process between SICA and member states (or persons)

The court may offer consultation to the region's supreme courts. In 2005, it
ruled that Nicaraguan congressional reforms (which removed control of water,
energy and telecommunications from President Enrique Bolaños) were "legally
inapplicable".[_citation needed_] As of July 2005, the CCJ had made 70
resolutions since hearing its first case in 1994.
