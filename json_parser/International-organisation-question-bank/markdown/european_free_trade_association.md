Regional trade organization and free trade area

The **European Free Trade Association** (**EFTA**) is a regional trade
organization and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland,
Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The organization operates in parallel
with the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the
European single market and are part of the Schengen Area. They are not,
however, party to the European Union Customs Union.

EFTA was historically one of the two dominant western European trade blocs,
but is now much smaller and closely associated with its historical competitor,
the European Union. It was established on 3 May 1960 to serve as an
alternative trade bloc for those European states that were unable or unwilling
to join the then European Economic Community (EEC), the main predecessor of
the EU. The Stockholm Convention (1960), to establish the EFTA, was signed on
4 January 1960 in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the "Outer
Seven": Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United
Kingdom). A revised Convention, the Vaduz Convention, was signed on 21 June
2001 and entered into force on 1 June 2002.

After 1995 only two founding members remained, namely Norway and Switzerland.
The other five, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, had
joined the EU at some point in the intervening years. The initial Stockholm
Convention was superseded by the Vaduz Convention, which aimed to provide a
successful framework for continuing the expansion and liberalization of trade,
both among the organization's member states and with the rest of the world.

While the EFTA is not a customs union and member states have full rights to
enter into bilateral third-country trade arrangements, it does have a
coordinated trade policy. As a result, its member states have jointly
concluded free trade agreements with the EU and a number of other countries.
To participate in the EU's single market, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway
are parties to the Agreement on a European Economic Area (EEA), with
compliances regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court.
Switzerland has a set of multilateral agreements with the EU and its member
states instead.[_dubious – discuss_]

## Membership

### History

EFTA member states

Former members, which left to join the EU

Rest of EU member states

On 12 January 1960, the Convention establishing the European Free Trade
Association was initiated in the Golden Hall of the Stockholm City Hall. This
established the progressive elimination of customs duties on industrial
products, but did not affect agricultural or fisheries products.

The main difference between the early EEC and the EFTA was that the latter did
not operate common external customs tariffs unlike the former: each EFTA
member was free to establish its individual customs duties against, or its
individual free trade agreements with, non-EFTA countries.

The founding members of the EFTA were: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal,
Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During the 1960s, these countries
were often referred to as the "Outer Seven", as opposed to the Inner Six of
the then European Economic Community (EEC).

Finland became an associate member in 1961 and a full member in 1986, and
Iceland joined in 1970. The United Kingdom and Denmark joined the EEC in 1973
and hence ceased to be EFTA members. Portugal also left EFTA for the European
Community in 1986. Liechtenstein joined the EFTA in 1991 (previously its
interests had been represented by Switzerland). Austria, Sweden, and Finland
joined the EU in 1995 and thus ceased to be EFTA members.

Twice, in 1972 and in 1994, the Norwegian government had tried to join the EU
(still the EEC, in 1973) and by doing so, leave the EFTA. However, both the
times, the membership of the EU was rejected in national referendums, keeping
Norway in the EFTA. Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 due to the
2008–2011 Icelandic financial crisis, but has since dropped its bid.

### Other negotiations

Members of the European Union (blue) and  
EFTA (green)

Between 1994 and 2011, EFTA memberships for Andorra, San Marino, Monaco, the
Isle of Man, Turkey, Israel, Morocco, and other European Neighbourhood Policy
partners were discussed.

#### Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino

In November 2012, after the Council of the European Union had called for an
evaluation of the EU's relations with Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino, which
they described as "fragmented", the European Commission published a report
outlining the options for their further integration into the EU. Unlike
Liechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA via the EFTA and the Schengen
Agreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of
agreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to
the current situation:

  1. A Sectoral Approach with separate agreements with each state covering an entire policy area.
  2. A comprehensive, multilateral Framework Association Agreement (FAA) with the three states.
  3. EEA membership, and
  4. EU membership.

However, the Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the
major issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was
dismissed in the near future because "the EU institutions are currently not
adapted to the accession of such small-sized countries". The remaining
options, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and
were recommended by the commission. In response, the Council requested that
negotiations with the three microstates on further integration continue, and
that a report be prepared by the end of 2013 detailing the implications of the
two viable alternatives and recommendations on how to proceed.

As EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU member states, the
consent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join
the EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr Støre, then
Foreign Minister of Norway which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA
membership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their
integration into the internal market due to their different requirements from
those of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified
association would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, Støre's
successor, responded to the commission's report in late 2012 by questioning
whether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet
the obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway would be
open to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decided
to submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision
on the matter. Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission
to the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to
discuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not
impede the functioning of the organization. However, he suggested that the
option of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside of both
the EFTA and the EU, should be considered. On 18 November 2013, the EU
Commission concluded that "the participation of the small-sized countries in
the EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political
and institutional reasons", and that Association Agreements were a more
feasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market.

#### Norway

The Norwegian electorate had rejected treaties of accession to the EU in two
referendums. At the time of the first referendum in 1972, their neighbour,
Denmark joined. Since the second referendum in 1994, two other Nordic
neighbours, Sweden and Finland, have joined the EU. The last two governments
of Norway have not advanced the question, as they have both been coalition
governments consisting of proponents and opponents of EU membership.

#### Switzerland

Since Switzerland rejected the EEA membership in a referendum in 1992, more
referendums on EU membership have been initiated, the last time being in 2001.
These were all rejected. Switzerland has been in a customs union with fellow
EFTA member state and neighbour Liechtenstein since 1924.

#### Iceland

On 16 July 2009, the government of Iceland formally applied for EU membership,
but the negotiation process was suspended in mid-2013, and in 2015 the foreign
ministers wrote to withdraw its application.

#### Faroe Islands (Kingdom of Denmark)

Denmark was a founding member of EFTA in 1960, but its membership ended in
1973, when it joined the European Communities. The autonomous territories of
the Kingdom of Denmark were covered by Denmark's EFTA membership: Greenland
from 1961 and the Faroe Islands from 1968. In mid-2005, representatives of the
Faroe Islands raised the possibility of their territory re-joining the EFTA.
Because Article 56 of the EFTA Convention only allows sovereign states to
become members of the EFTA, the Faroes considered the possibility that the
"Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroes" could join the EFTA on their
behalf. The Danish Government has stated that this mechanism would not allow
the Faroes to become a member of the EEA because Denmark was already a party
to the EEA Agreement.

The Faroes already have an extensive bilateral free trade agreement with
Iceland, known as the Hoyvík Agreement.

#### United Kingdom

The United Kingdom was a co-founder of EFTA in 1960, but ceased to be a member
upon joining the European Economic Community. The country held a referendum in
2016 on withdrawing from the EU (popularly referred to as "Brexit"), resulting
in a 51.9% vote in favour of withdrawing. A 2013 research paper presented to
the Parliament of the United Kingdom proposed a number of alternatives to EU
membership which would continue to allow it access to the EU's internal
market, including continuing EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the
Swiss model of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the
single market.

In the first meeting since the Brexit vote, EFTA reacted by saying both that
they were open to a UK return, and that Britain has many issues to work
through. The president of Switzerland Johann Schneider-Ammann stated that its
return would strengthen the association. However, in August 2016 the Norwegian
Government expressed reservations. Norway's European affairs minister,
Elisabeth Vik Aspaker, told the _Aftenposten_ newspaper: "It's not certain
that it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organization. It
would shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway's interests."

In late 2016, the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that her
priority was to keep the whole of the UK in the European single market but
that taking Scotland alone into the EEA was an option being "looked at".
However, other EFTA states have stated that only sovereign states are eligible
for membership, so it could only join if it became independent from the UK,
unless the solution scouted for the Faroes in 2005 were to be adopted (see
above).

In early 2018, British MPs Antoinette Sandbach, Stephen Kinnock and Stephen
Hammond called for the UK to rejoin EFTA.

## Relationship with the European Union: the European Economic Area

In 1992, the EU, its member states, and the EFTA member states signed the
Agreement on the European Economic Area in Porto, Portugal. However, the
proposal that Switzerland ratify its participation was rejected by referendum.
(Nevertheless, Switzerland has multiple bilateral treaties with the EU that
allow it to participate in the European Single Market, the Schengen Agreement
and other programmes). Thus, except for Switzerland, the EFTA members are also
members of the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises three member
states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and 27 member states of
the European Union (EU). It was established on 1 January 1994 following an
agreement with the European Economic Community (which had become the European
Community two months earlier). It allows the EFTA-EEA states to participate in
the EU's Internal Market without being members of the EU. They adopt almost
all EU legislation related to the single market, except laws on agriculture
and fisheries. However, they also contribute to and influence the formation of
new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a
formal decision-shaping process.[_citation needed_] One EFTA member,
Switzerland, has not joined the EEA but has a series of bilateral agreements,
including a free trade agreement, with the EU.

The following table summarises the various components of EU laws applied in
the EFTA countries and their sovereign territories. Some territories of EU
member states also have a special status in regard to EU laws applied as is
the case with some European microstates.

### EEA institutions

A Joint Committee consisting of the EEA-EFTA States plus the European
Commission (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant EU law
to the non-EU members. An EEA Council meets twice yearly to govern the overall
relationship between the EEA members.

Rather than setting up pan-EEA institutions, the activities of the EEA are
regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court. The EFTA
Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA
members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA).
Since Switzerland is not an EEA member, it does not participate in these
institutions.

The EFTA Surveillance Authority performs a role for EFTA members that is
equivalent to that of the European Commission for the EU, as "guardian of the
treaties" and the EFTA Court performs the European Court of Justice-equivalent
role.

The original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court: the European Court of
Justice was to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the
EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice ruled by the Opinion 1/91 that it
would be a violation of the treaties to give to the EU institutions these
powers with respect to non-EU member states. Therefore, the current
arrangement was developed instead.

### EEA and Norway Grants

The EEA and Norway Grants are the financial contributions of Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway to reduce social and economic disparities in Europe.
They were established in conjunction with the 2004 enlargement of the European
Economic Area (EEA), which brought together the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and
Norway in the Internal Market. In the period from 2004 to 2009, €1.3 billion
of project funding was made available for project funding in the 15
beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe. The EEA and Norway Grants
are administered by the Financial Mechanism Office, which is affiliated to the
EFTA Secretariat in Brussels.

## International conventions

EFTA also originated the Hallmarking Convention and the Pharmaceutical
Inspection Convention, both of which are open to non-EFTA states.

## Travel policies

### Free movement of people within EFTA and the EU/EEA

EFTA member states' citizens enjoy freedom of movement in each other's
territories in accordance with the EFTA convention. EFTA & EEA nationals also
enjoy freedom of movement in the European Union (EU). EFTA nationals and EU
citizens are not only visa-exempt but are legally entitled to enter and reside
in each other's countries. The **Citizens' Rights Directive** (also sometimes
called the "Free Movement Directive") defines the right of free movement for
citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the three EFTA
members Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein plus the member states of the EU.
Switzerland, which is a member of EFTA but not of the EEA, is not bound by the
Directive but rather has a separate multilateral agreement on free movement
with the EU and its member states.

As a result, a citizen of an EFTA country can live and work in all the other
EFTA countries and in all the EU countries, and a citizen of an EU country can
live and work in all the EFTA countries (but for voting and working in
sensitive fields, such as government / police / military, citizenship is often
required, and non-citizens may not have the same rights to welfare and
unemployment benefits as citizens).

## Portugal Fund

The Portugal Fund came into operation in February 1977 when Portugal was still
a member of EFTA. It was to provide funding for the development of Portugal
after the Carnation Revolution and the consequential restoration of democracy
and the decolonization of the country's overseas possessions. This followed a
period of economic sanctions by most of the international community, which
left Portugal economically underdeveloped compared to the rest of the western
Europe. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985 in order to join the EEC, the
remaining EFTA members decided to continue the Portugal Fund so that Portugal
would continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-
interest loan from the EFTA member states to the value of US$100 million.
Repayment was originally to commence in 1988, however, EFTA then decided to
postpone the start of repayments until 1998. The Portugal Fund was dissolved
in January 2002.
