Specialized agency of the United Nations

The **United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization**
(**UNESCO** /juːˈnɛskoʊ/) is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN)
with the aim of promoting world peace and security through international
cooperation in education, arts, sciences and culture. It has 194 member states
and 12 associate members, as well as partners in the non-governmental,
intergovernmental and private sector. Headquartered in Paris, France, UNESCO
has 53 regional field offices and 199 national commissions.

UNESCO was founded in 1945 as the successor to the League of Nations'
International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. UNESCO's founding
mission, which was shaped by the events of World War II, is to advance peace,
sustainable development and human rights by facilitating collaboration and
dialogue among nations. It pursues this objective through five major programme
areas: education, natural sciences, social/human sciences, culture and
communication/information. UNESCO sponsors projects that improve literacy,
provide technical training and education, advance science, protect independent
media and press freedom, preserve regional and cultural history, and promote
cultural diversity. The organization prominently helps establish and secure
World Heritage Sites of cultural and natural importance.

UNESCO is governed by the General Conference composed of member states and
associate members, which meets biannually to set the agency's programs and
budget. It also elects members of the executive board, which manages UNESCO's
work, and appoints every four years a Director-General, who serves as UNESCO's
chief administrator.

## History

### Origins

UNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced to a League
of Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a commission to study the
feasibility of having nations freely share cultural, educational and
scientific achievements. This new body, the International Committee on
Intellectual Cooperation (ICIC), was created in 1922 and counted such figures
as Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Robert A. Millikan, and
Gonzague de Reynold among its members (being thus a small commission of the
League of Nations essentially centred on Western Europe). The International
Institute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris in
September 1924, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC. However, the
onset of World War II largely interrupted the work of these predecessor
organizations. As for private initiatives, the International Bureau of
Education (IBE) began to work as a non-governmental organization in the
service of international educational development since December 1925 and
joined UNESCO in 1969, after having established a joint commission in 1952.

### Creation

After the signing of the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United
Nations, the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings
in London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945. On 30
October 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in
the Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United
States and the USSR. This was followed by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference
proposals of 9 October 1944. Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with
the recommendations of the United Nations Conference on International
Organization (UNCIO), held in San Francisco from April to June 1945, a United
Nations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural
organization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945 with
forty-four governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed
by Rab Butler, the Minister of Education for the United Kingdom, who had a
great deal of influence in its development. At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution
of UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory
Commission was established. The Preparatory Commission operated between 16
November 1945, and 4 November 1946 — the date when UNESCO's Constitution came
into force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state.

The first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946,
and elected Julian Huxley to Director-General. United States Army colonel,
university president and civil rights advocate Blake R. Van Leer joined as a
member as well. The Constitution was amended in November 1954 when the General
Conference resolved that members of the executive board would be
representatives of the governments of the States of which they are nationals
and would not, as before, act in their personal capacity. This change in
governance distinguished UNESCO from its predecessor, the ICIC, in how member
states would work together in the organization's fields of competence. As
member states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political
and historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular
during the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the
Soviet Union.

### Development

Among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism,
for example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration
of anthropologists (among them was Claude Lévi-Strauss) and other scientists
in 1950 and concluding with the 1978 Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice.

In 1955, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO saying that some of
the organization's publications amounted to "interference" in the country's
"racial problems". It rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership
of Nelson Mandela.

One of the early work of UNESCO in the education field was a pilot project on
fundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, which was launched in
1947. Following this project one of expert missions to other countries,
included a 1949 mission to Afghanistan. UNESCO recommended in 1948 that Member
countries should make free primary education compulsory and universal. The
World Conference on Education for All, in Jomtien, Thailand, started a global
movement in 1990 to provide basic education for all children, youths and
adults. In 2000, World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, led member
governments to commit for achieving basic education for all in 2015.

The World Declaration on Higher Education was adopted by UNESCO's World
Conference on Higher Education on 9 October 1998, with the aim of setting
global standards on the ideals and accessibility of higher education.

UNESCO's early activities in culture included the International Campaign to
Save the Monuments of Nubia, launched in 1960. The purpose of the campaign was
to move the Great Temple of Abu Simbel to keep it from being swamped by the
Nile after the construction of the Aswan Dam. During the 20-year campaign, 22
monuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and
largest in a series of campaigns including Mohenjo-daro (Pakistan), Fes
(Morocco), Kathmandu (Nepal), Borobudur (Indonesia) and the Acropolis of
Athens (Greece). The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in
1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and
Natural Heritage. In 1976, the World Heritage Committee was established and
the first sites were included on the World Heritage List in 1978. Since then
important legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been
adopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of
the Intangible Cultural Heritage) and 2005 (Convention on the Protection and
Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions).

An intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the
creation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible
for establishing the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) later
on, in 1954.

Arid Zone programming, 1948–1966, is another example of an early major UNESCO
project in the field of natural sciences.

In 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at
reconciling the environment and development, a problem that continues to be
addressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the
1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme.

UNESCO has been credited with the diffusion of national science bureaucracies.

In the field of communication, the "free flow of ideas by word and image" has
been in UNESCO's constitution since it was established, following the
experience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in
indoctrinating populations for aggression. In the years immediately following
World War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the
identification of needs for means of mass communication around the world.
UNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.
In response to calls for a "New World Information and Communication Order" in
the late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study
of Communication Problems, which produced the 1980 MacBride report (named
after the chair of the commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Seán
MacBride). The same year, UNESCO created the International Programme for the
Development of Communication (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote
media development in developing countries. In 1993, UNESCO's General
Conference endorsed the Windhoek Declaration on media independence and
pluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its
adoption, 3 May, as World Press Freedom Day. Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded
the UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize every 3 May.

### 21st century

### Changes in States' memberships

#### Israel, Palestine, and the United States

In 2011, UNESCO admitted Palestine as a member.

Laws had passed in the United States after Palestine applied for UNESCO and
WHO membership in April 1989 mean that the United States cannot contribute
financially to any UN organization that accepts Palestine as a full member. As
a result, the United States withdrew its funding, which had accounted for
about 22% of UNESCO's budget. Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to
UNESCO by freezing Israeli payments to UNESCO and imposing sanctions on the
Palestinian Authority, stating that Palestine's admittance would be
detrimental "to potential peace talks".

In 2013, two years after stopping payment of its dues to UNESCO, the United
States and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights, but without losing the right to
be elected; thus, the United States was elected as a member of the executive
board for the period from 2016 to 2019. In 2019, Israel left UNESCO after 69
years of membership, with Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon writing:
"UNESCO is the body that continually rewrites history, including by erasing
the Jewish connection to Jerusalem... it is corrupted and manipulated by
Israel's enemies... we are not going to be a member of an organization that
deliberately acts against us."

Also in 2023, the United States stated its intent to rejoin UNESCO, five years
after leaving, and to pay its US$600 million of back dues. The United States
was readmitted by the UNESCO General Conference that July. Three years later,
in 2025, however, the United States stated its intent to withdraw again, to be
effective as of December 2026.

#### Russia

In 2023, Russia was not renewed as member of the executive committee for the
first time, after failing to get sufficient votes.

### Cultural policies and Sustainable development

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and United Nations-wide efforts to
achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, the UNESCO reactivated in
2022 the cycle of MONDIACULT Conferences (World Conference on Cultural
Policies and Sustainable Development) whose first edition had been held in
Mexico City in 1982. The 2022 MONDIACULT conference was held again in Mexico,
and a 2025 edition is planned in Barcelona, Spain.

documents. These two distinct sets of information are published on the IATI
registry, respectively based on the IATI Activity Standard and the IATI
Organization Standard.

### New proposed lists

Two new UNESCO lists have been proposed.

The first proposed list would focus on movable cultural heritage such as
artifacts, paintings, and biofacts. The list could include cultural objects,
such as the Jōmon Venus of Japan, the _Mona Lisa_ of France, the Gebel el-Arak
Knife of Egypt, _The Ninth Wave_ of Russia, the Seated Woman of Çatalhöyük of
Turkey, the _David_ (Michelangelo) of Italy, the Mathura Herakles of India,
the Manunggul Jar of the Philippines, the Crown of Baekje of South Korea, _The
Hay Wain_ of the United Kingdom, and the Benin Bronzes of Nigeria.

The second proposed list would focus on the world's living species.

## Media

UNESCO and its specialized institutions issue a number of magazines.

Created in 1945, _The UNESCO Courier_ magazine states its mission to "promote
UNESCO's ideals, maintain a platform for the dialogue between cultures and
provide a forum for international debate". Since March 2006 it has been
available free online, with limited printed issues. Its articles express the
opinions of the authors which are not necessarily the opinions of UNESCO.
There was a hiatus in publishing between 2012 and 2017.

In 1950, UNESCO initiated the quarterly review _Impact of Science on Society_
(also known as _Impact_) to discuss the influence of science on society. The
journal ceased publication in 1992.

## Official UNESCO NGOs

UNESCO has official relations with 322 international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs). Most of these are what UNESCO calls "operational"; a
select few are "formal". The highest form of affiliation to UNESCO is "formal
associate", and the 22 NGOs with _formal associate_ (ASC) relations occupying

## Offices and headquarters

The Garden of Peace at UNESCO headquarters

The UNESCO headquarters is located at Place de Fontenoy in Paris, France.
Several architects collaborated on the construction of the headquarters,
including Bernard Zehrfuss, Marcel Breuer and Luigi Nervi. It includes a
_Garden of Peace_ which was donated by the Government of Japan. This garden
was designed by American-Japanese sculptor artist Isamu Noguchi in 1958 and
installed by Japanese gardener Toemon Sano. In 1994–1995, in memory of the
50th anniversary of UNESCO, a meditation room was built by Tadao Ando.

UNESCO's field offices across the globe are categorized into four primary
office types based upon their function and geographic coverage: cluster

## Controversies

### New World Information and Communication Order

UNESCO has been the centre of controversy in the past, particularly in its
relationships with the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and the
former Soviet Union. During the 1970s and 1980s, UNESCO's support for a "New
World Information and Communication Order" and its MacBride report calling for
democratization of the media and more egalitarian access to information was
condemned in these countries as attempts to curb freedom of the press. UNESCO
was perceived as a platform for communists and Third World dictators to attack
the West, in contrast to accusations made by the USSR in the late 1940s and
early 1950s. In 1984, the United States withheld its contributions and
withdrew from the organization in protest, followed by the United Kingdom in
1985. Singapore withdrew also at the end of 1985, citing rising membership
fees. Following a change of government in 1997, the UK rejoined. The United
States rejoined in 2003, followed by Singapore on 8 October 2007.

### China

UNESCO has been criticized as being used by the People's Republic of China to
present a Chinese Communist Party version of history and to dilute the
contributions of ethnic minorities in China such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.

### Israel

Israel was admitted to UNESCO in 1949, one year after its creation. Israel has
maintained its membership since then. In 2010, Israel designated the Cave of
the Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem – both in the West
Bank – as National Heritage Sites and announced restoration work, prompting
criticism from the Obama administration and protests from Palestinians. In
October 2010, UNESCO's executive board voted to declare the sites as "al-Haram
al-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs" and "Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb"
and stated that they were "an integral part of the occupied Palestinian
Territories" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of
international law. UNESCO described the sites as significant to "people of the
Muslim, Christian and Jewish traditions", and accused Israel of highlighting
only the Jewish character of the sites. Israel in turn accused UNESCO of
"detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage", and accused it of being
politically motivated. The Rabbi of the Western Wall said that Rachel's tomb
had not previously been declared a holy Muslim site. Israel partially
suspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon
declared that the resolution was a "part of Palestinian escalation". Zevulun
Orlev, chairman of the Knesset Education and Culture Committee, referred to
the resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a
scientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the
world.

On 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at Jordan's insistence,
censured[_clarification needed_] Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the
Mughrabi Gate Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that
Jordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing
bridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement,
saying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to
address the UNESCO committee over objections from Egypt.

In January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-
General, Irina Bokova, "indefinitely postponed" and effectively cancelled an
exhibit created by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre entitled "The People, The Book,
The Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the Jewish people and the Land
of Israel". The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January
in Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at
UNESCO argued that its display would "harm the peace process". The author of
the exhibition, professor Robert Wistrich of the Hebrew University's Vidal
Sassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism, called the
cancellation an "appalling act", and characterized Bokova's decision as "an
arbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people
and its history". UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the
year, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.

On 1 January 2019, Israel formally left UNESCO in pursuance of the US
withdrawal over perceived continuous anti-Israel bias.

#### Occupied Palestine Resolution

On 13 October 2016, UNESCO passed a resolution on East Jerusalem that
condemned Israel for "aggressions" by Israeli police and soldiers and "illegal
measures" against the freedom of worship and Muslims' access to their holy
sites, while also recognizing Israel as the occupying power. Palestinian
leaders welcomed the decision. While the text acknowledged the "importance of
the Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions",
it referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its
Muslim name "Al-Haram al-Sharif", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response,
Israel denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words "Temple
Mount" or "Har HaBayit", stating that it denies Jewish ties to the key holy
site. After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and
diplomats, including Benjamin Netanyahu and Ayelet Shaked, Israel froze all
ties with the organization. The resolution was condemned by Ban Ki-moon and
the Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and
Christianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and "to deny,
conceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines
the integrity of the site. "Al-Aqsa Mosque [or] Al-Haram al-Sharif" is also
Temple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism." It was also
rejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a "hateful
anti-Israel sentiment", and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over
Italy's abstention. On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the
resolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous "refusal to let
the body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their
conservation status". Despite containing some softening of language following
Israeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the
text. The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the
Temple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name – a significant
semantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering
condemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines
stated: "This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided
resolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO."

In October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw
from the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias.

### Palestine

#### Palestinian youth magazine controversy

In February 2011, an article was published in a Palestinian youth magazine in
which a teenage girl described one of her four role models as Adolf Hitler. In
December 2011, UNESCO, which partly funded the magazine, condemned the
material and subsequently withdrew support.

#### Islamic University of Gaza controversy

In 2012, UNESCO decided to establish a chair at the Islamic University of Gaza
in the field of astronomy, astrophysics, and space sciences, fueling
controversy and criticism. Israel bombed the school in 2008 stating that they
develop and store weapons there, which Israel restated in criticizing UNESCO's
move.

The head, Kamalain Shaath, defended UNESCO, stating that "the Islamic
University is a purely academic university that is interested only in
education and its development". Israeli ambassador to UNESCO Nimrod Barkan
planned to submit a letter of protest with information about the university's
ties to Hamas, especially angry that this was the first Palestinian university
that UNESCO chose to cooperate with. He never provided any evidence to support
his claim of ties to Hamas. The Jewish organization B'nai B'rith criticized
the move as well.

### Listing Nanjing Massacre documents

In 2015, Japan threatened to halt funding of UNESCO because of the
organization's decision to include documents related to the 1937 Nanjing
massacre in the latest listing for its "Memory of the World" program. In
October 2016, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida confirmed that Japan's
2016 annual funding of ¥4.4 billion had been suspended, although he denied any
direct link with the Nanjing document controversy.

### United States and UNESCO

The United States withdrew from UNESCO in 1984, citing the "highly
politicized" nature of the organization, its ostensible "hostility toward the
basic institutions of a free society, especially a free market and a free
press", as well as its "unrestrained budgetary expansion", and poor management
under then Director-General Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow of Senegal.

On 19 September 1989, US Congressman Jim Leach stated before a congressional
subcommittee:

> The reasons for the withdrawal of the United States from UNESCO in 1984 are
> well-known; my view is that we overreacted to the calls of some who wanted
> to radicalize UNESCO, and the calls of others who wanted the United States
> to lead in emasculating the UN system. The fact is UNESCO is one of the
> least dangerous international institutions ever created. While some member
> countries within UNESCO attempted to push journalistic views antithetical to
> the values of the west, and engage in Israel bashing, UNESCO itself never
> adopted such radical postures. The United States opted for empty-chair
> diplomacy, after winning, not losing, the battles we engaged in... It was
> nuts to get out, and would be nuttier not to rejoin.

Leach concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world
information order, money management, and arms control policy to be the
impetuses behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before departing from
UNESCO, a withdrawal from the IAEA had been pushed on him. On 1 October 2003,
the United States rejoined UNESCO.

On 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO it would again withdraw
from the organization, on 31 December 2018; Israel followed suit. The
Department of State cited "mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for
fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at
UNESCO".

The United States has not paid over $600 million in dues since it stopped
paying its $80 million annual UNESCO dues when Palestine became a full member
in 2011. Israel and the United States were among the 14 votes against the
membership out of 194 member countries. When the United States announced it
was rejoining the body in 2023, it also pledged to pay all past-due payments.

On 4 February 2025, the White House said to conduct a review of US membership
in UNESCO. On 22 July, Donald Trump decided that US will again withdraw from
UNESCO, effective at the end of 2026.

### Kurdish–Turkish conflict

On 25 May 2016, Turkish poet and human rights activist Zülfü Livaneli resigned
as Turkey's only UNESCO goodwill ambassador. He highlighted the human rights
situation in Turkey and the destruction of the historical Sur district of
Diyarbakir, the largest city in Kurdish-majority southeast Turkey, during
fighting between the Turkish army and Kurdish militants as the main reasons
for his resignation. Livaneli said: "To pontificate on peace while remaining
silent against such violations is a contradiction of the fundamental ideals of
UNESCO."

### Campaigns against illicit art trading

In 2020 UNESCO stated that the size of the illicit trade in cultural property
amounted to 10 billion dollars a year. A report that same year by the Rand
Organization suggested the actual market is "not likely to be larger than a
few hundred million dollars each year". An expert cited by UNESCO as
attributing the 10 billion figure denied it, saying he had "no idea" where the
figure came from. Art dealers were particularly critical of the UNESCO figure
because it amounted to 15% of the total world art market.

In November 2020, part of a UNESCO advertising campaign intended to highlight
international trafficking in looted artefacts had to be withdrawn after it
falsely presented a series of museum-held artworks with known provenances as
recently looted objects held in private collections. The adverts claimed that
a head of Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's collection since 1930 had been
looted from a Kabul Museum in 2001 and then smuggled into the US art market,
that a funerary monument from Palmyra that the Met had acquired in 1901 had
been recently looted from the Palmyra Museum by Islamic State militants and
then smuggled into the European antiquities market, and that an Ivory Coast
mask with a provenance that indicates it was in the United States by 1954 was
looted during armed clashes in 2010–2011. After complaints by the Met, the
adverts were withdrawn.
