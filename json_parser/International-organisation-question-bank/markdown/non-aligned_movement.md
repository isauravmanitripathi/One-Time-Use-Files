Group of countries not in major power blocs

The **Non-Aligned Movement** (**NAM**) is a forum of 121 countries that are
not formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. It was founded with
the view to advancing interests of developing countries in the context of Cold
War confrontation. After the United Nations, it is the largest grouping of
states worldwide.

The movement originated in the aftermath of the Korean War, as an effort by
some countries to counterbalance the rapid bi-polarization of the world during
the Cold War, whereby two major powers formed blocs and embarked on a policy
to pull the rest of the world into their orbits. One of these was the pro-
Soviet socialist bloc whose best known alliance was the Warsaw Pact, and the
other the pro-American capitalist group of countries, many of which belonged
to NATO. In 1961, drawing on the principles agreed at the Bandung Conference
of 1955, the Non-Aligned Movement was formally established in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, through an initiative led by Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito,
Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah,
Indonesian president Sukarno, and United Arab Republic president Gamal Abdel
Nasser.

This led to the first Conference of Heads of State or Governments of Non-
Aligned Countries. The purpose of the organization was summarized by Fidel
Castro in his Havana Declaration of 1979 as to ensure "the national
independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned
countries" in their "struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-
colonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation,
domination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc
politics."

The countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the
United Nations' members and contain 55% of the world population. Membership is
particularly concentrated in countries considered to be developing countries,
although the Non-Aligned Movement also has a number of developed nations.

The Non-Aligned Movement gained the most traction in the 1950s and early
1960s, when the international policy of non-alignment achieved major successes
in decolonization, disarmament, opposition to racism and opposition to
apartheid in South Africa, and persisted throughout the entire Cold War,
despite several conflicts between members, and despite some members developing
closer ties with either the Soviet Union, China, or the United States. In the
years since the Cold War's end in 1991, the movement has focused on developing
multilateral ties and connections as well as unity among the developing
nations of the world, especially those in the Global South.

## History

### Origins and the Cold War

Warsaw Pact in red. Josip Broz Tito, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Gamal Abdel Nasser,
pioneers of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Brioni Meeting

The term 'Non-Alignment' was used for the first time in 1950 at the United
Nations by India and Yugoslavia, both of which refused to align themselves
with any side in the multi-alliances involving Korean War. Drawing on the
principles agreed at the Bandung Conference in 1955, the Non-Aligned Movement
as an organization was founded on the Brijuni islands in Yugoslavia in 1956
and was formalized by signing the Declaration of Brijuni on 19 July 1956. The
Declaration was signed by Yugoslavia's president, Josip Broz Tito, India's
prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Egypt's president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. One
of the quotations within the Declaration is "Peace can not be achieved with
separation, but with the aspiration towards collective security in global
terms and expansion of freedom, as well as terminating the domination of one
country over another". According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, an ideologue of the
Congress party which ruled India for most part of the Cold War years, the Non-
Aligned Movement arose from the desire of Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders
of the newly independent countries of the third world to guard their
independence and sovereignty "in face of complex international situation
demanding allegiance to either two warring superpowers".

The movement advocates a middle course for states in the developing world
between the Western and Eastern Blocs during the Cold War. The phrase itself
was first used to represent the doctrine by Indian diplomat V. K. Krishna
Menon in 1953, at the United Nations.[_unreliable source?_]

But it soon after became the name to refer to the participants of the
_Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries_ first
held in 1961. The term "non-alignment" was established in 1953 at the United
Nations. Nehru used the phrase in a 1954 speech in Colombo, Sri Lanka. In this
speech, Zhou Enlai and Nehru described the Five Principles of Peaceful
Coexistence to be used as a guide for Sino-Indian relations called
_Panchsheel_ (five restraints); these principles would later serve as the
basis of the Non-Aligned Movement. The five principles were:

  * Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
  * Mutual non-aggression.
  * Mutual non-interference in domestic affairs.
  * Equality and mutual benefit.
  * Peaceful co-existence.

A significant milestone in the development of the Non-Aligned Movement was the
1955 Bandung Conference, a conference of Asian and African states hosted by
Indonesian president Sukarno, who gave a significant boost to promote this
movement. Bringing together Sukarno, U Nu, Nasser, Nehru, Tito, Nkrumah and
Menon with the likes of Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai, and Norodom Sihanouk, as well
as U Thant and a young Indira Gandhi, the conference adopted a "declaration on
promotion of world peace and cooperation", which included Zhou Enlai and
Nehru's five principles, and a collective pledge to remain neutral in the Cold
War. Six years after Bandung, an initiative of Yugoslav president Josip Broz
Tito led to the first _Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-
Aligned Countries_ , which was held in September 1961 in Belgrade. The term
_non-aligned movement_ appears first in the fifth conference in 1976, where
participating countries are denoted as _members of the movement_.

At the Lusaka Conference in September 1970, the member nations added as aims
of the movement the peaceful resolution of disputes and the abstention from
the big power military alliances and pacts. Another added aim was opposition
to stationing of military bases in foreign countries.

In 1975, the member nations which also were part of the United Nations General
Assembly pushed for the Resolution 3379 along with Arab countries and the
support of the Soviet bloc. It was a declarative non-binding measure that
equated Zionism with South Africa's Apartheid and as a form of racial
discrimination. The bloc voting produced a majority in the United Nations that
systematically condemned Israel in the following resolutions: 3089, 3210,
3236, 32/40, etc.

Some Non-Aligned member nations were involved in serious conflicts with other
members, notably India and Pakistan as well as Iran and Iraq.

#### Cuba's role

In the 1970s, Cuba made a major effort to assume a leadership role in the
world's non-alignment movement. The country established military advisory
missions and economic and social reform programs. The 1976 world conference of
the Non-Aligned Movement applauded Cuban internationalism, "which assisted the
people of Angola in frustrating the expansionist and colonialist strategy of
South Africa's racist regime and its allies." The next Non-Aligned conference
was scheduled for Havana in 1979, to be chaired by Fidel Castro, with his
becoming the de facto spokesman for the Movement. The conference in September
1979 marked the zenith of Cuban prestige. Most, but not all, attendees
believed that Cuba was not aligned with the Soviet camp in the Cold War.

However, in December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan's civil
war. Up until that time, Afghanistan was also an active member of the Non-
Aligned Movement. At the United Nations, nonaligned members voted 56 to 9,
with 26 abstaining, to condemn the Soviet Union. Cuba voted against the
resolution, in support of the USSR. It lost its nonaligned leadership and
reputation after Castro, instead of becoming a high-profile spokesman for the
movement, remained quiet and inactive. More broadly the movement was deeply
split over the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979, as many members of the Non-Aligned
Movement, particularly the predominantly Muslim states, condemned it.

### Post-Cold War

With the end of the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement transformed. The
breakup of Yugoslavia (a prominent founding member) in 1991–1992 also affected
the movement; the regular Ministerial Meeting of the Movement, held in New
York during the regular yearly session of the General Assembly of the United
Nations in 1992 suspended Yugoslavia's membership. The various successor
states of Yugoslavia have expressed little interest in membership, though
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia retain observer status.
India, another founding member, appears to have downgraded its emphasis on the
movement.

Membership applications from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Costa Rica were
rejected in 1995 and 1998 respectively. In 2004 Malta and Cyprus ceased to be
members when they joined the European Union, as required. Azerbaijan and Fiji
are the most recent entrants, both having joined the Movement in 2011.
Azerbaijan and Belarus, which joined in 1998, remain the only members on the
continent of Europe.

Since the end of the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement has felt forced to
redefine itself and to reinvent its purpose in the new world-system. A major
question has been whether any of its foundational ideologies, principally
national independence, territorial integrity, and the struggle against
colonialism and imperialism, apply to contemporary issues. The movement has
emphasized its principles of multilateralism, equality, and mutual non-
aggression in attempting to become a stronger voice for the Global South, and
an instrument that can promote the needs of member-nations at the
international level and strengthen their political leverage when negotiating
with developed nations. In its efforts to advance Southern interests, the
movement has stressed the importance of cooperation and unity amongst member
states. However, as in the past, cohesion remains a problem, since the size of
the organization and the divergence of agendas and allegiances present the
ongoing potential for fragmentation. While agreement on basic principles has
been smooth, taking definitive action _vis-à-vis_ particular international
issues has been rare, with the movement preferring to assert its criticism or
support rather than to pass hard-line resolutions.

The movement continues to see a role for itself: in its view, the world's
poorest nations remain exploited and marginalized, no longer by opposing
superpowers, but rather in a uni-polar world, and it is Western hegemony and
neo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself against. It
opposes foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs and aggressive
unilateral measures, but it has also shifted to focus on the socio-economic
challenges facing member states, especially the inequalities manifested by
globalization and the implications of neo-liberal policies. The Non-Aligned
Movement has identified economic underdevelopment, poverty, and social
injustices as growing threats to peace and security.

The 16th NAM summit took place in Tehran, Iran, from 26 to 31 August 2012.
According to the Teheran-based Mehr News Agency, representatives from over 150
countries were scheduled to attend. Attendance at the highest level included
27 presidents, two kings and emirs, seven prime ministers, nine vice-
presidents, two parliamentary spokesmen and five special envoys. At the
summit, Iran took over from Egypt as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement for the
period 2012 to 2015.

In 2016 Venezuela hosted the 17th NAM Summit.

Azerbaijan, host of the 18th NAM summit in 2019, holds the Non-Aligned
Movement presidency pending the 19th NAM summit, which took place in Kampala,
Uganda in January 2024.

## Organizational structure and membership

The movement stems from a desire not to be aligned within a
geopolitical/military structure and therefore itself does not have a very
strict organizational structure. Some organizational basics were defined at
the 1996 _Cartagena Document on Methodology_ The Summit Conference of Heads of
State or Government of Non-Aligned States is "the highest decision making
authority". The chairmanship rotates between countries and changes at every
summit of heads of state or government to the country organizing the summit.

Requirements for membership of the Non-Aligned Movement coincide with the key
beliefs of the United Nations. The current requirements are that the candidate
country has displayed practices in accordance with the ten "Bandung
principles" of 1955:

  * Respect for fundamental human rights and for the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations.
  * Respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations.
  * Recognition of the movements for national independence.
  * Recognition of the equality of all races and of the equality of all nations, large and small.
  * Abstention from intervention or interference in the internal affairs of another country.
  * Respect for the right of each nation to defend itself singly or collectively, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
  * Refraining from acts or threats of aggression or the use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any country.
  * Settlement of all international disputes by peaceful means, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations.
  * Promotion of mutual interests and co-operation.
  * Respect for justice and international obligations.

## Policies and ideology

Chairpersons of the NAM have included such diverse figures as Suharto, a
militaristic anti-communist; Nelson Mandela, a democratic socialist and famous
anti-apartheid activist; Mohamed Morsi, a conservative Islamist; Josip Broz
Tito, a Marxist–Leninist, Yugoslav leader; and Ernesto Samper, a Colombian
social liberal. Consisting of many governments with vastly different
ideologies, the Non-Aligned Movement is unified by its declared commitment to
world peace and security. At the seventh summit held in New Delhi in March
1983, the movement described itself as "history's biggest peace movement". The
movement places equal emphasis on disarmament. NAM's commitment to peace pre-
dates its formal institutionalization in 1961. The Brioni meeting between
heads of governments of India, Egypt and Yugoslavia in 1956 recognized that
there exists a vital link between struggle for peace and endeavours for
disarmament.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the NAM also sponsored campaigns for
restructuring commercial relations between developed and developing nations,
namely the New International Economic Order (NIEO), and its cultural
offspring, the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). The
latter, on its own, sparked a Non-Aligned initiative on cooperation for
communications, the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool, created in 1975 and later
converted into the NAM News Network in 2005.

The Non-Aligned Movement espouses policies and practices of cooperation,
especially those that are multilateral and provide mutual benefit to all those
involved. Almost all of the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are also
members of the United Nations. Both organizations have a stated policy of
peaceful cooperation, yet the successes the NAM has had with multilateral
agreements tend to be ignored by the larger, western- and developed- nation-
dominated UN. African concerns about apartheid were linked with Arab-Asian
concerns about Palestine and multilateral cooperation in these areas has
enjoyed moderate success. The Non-Aligned Movement has played a major role in
various ideological conflicts throughout its existence, including extreme
opposition to apartheid governments and support of guerrilla movements in
various locations, including Rhodesia and South Africa.

## Current activities and positions

### Reform of the UN Security Council

The movement has been outspoken in its criticism of current UN structures and
power dynamics, and advocating for the reforming of the United Nations
Security Council, stating that the organization has been used by powerful
states in ways that violate the movement's principles. It has made a number of
recommendations that it says would strengthen the representation and power of
"non-aligned" states. The proposed UN reforms are also aimed at improving the
transparency and democracy of UN decision-making. The UN Security Council is
the element it considers the most distorted, undemocratic, and in need of
reshaping.

### Self-determination of Puerto Rico

Since 1961, the organization has supported the discussion of the case of
Puerto Rico's self-determination before the United Nations.[_citation needed_]
A resolution on the matter was to be proposed on the XV Summit by the
Hostosian National Independence Movement but did not progress.

### Self-determination of Western Sahara

Since 1973, the group has supported the discussion of the case of Western
Sahara's self-determination before the United Nations. The movement reaffirmed
in its meeting (Sharm El Sheikh 2009) the support to the Self-determination of
the Sahrawi people by choosing between any valid option, welcomed the direct
converzations between the parties, and remembered the responsibility of the
United Nations on the Sahrawi issue.

### Sustainable developments

The movement is publicly committed to the tenets of sustainable development
and the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, but it believes that
the international community has not created conditions conducive to
development and has infringed upon the right to sovereign development by each
member state. Issues such as globalization, the debt burden, unfair trade
practices, the decline in foreign aid, donor conditionality, and the lack of
democracy in international financial decision-making are cited as factors
inhibiting development.

### Criticism of US foreign policy

In recent years the organization has criticized certain aspects of US foreign
policy. The 2003 invasion of Iraq and the War on Terrorism, its attempts to
stifle Iran and North Korea's nuclear plans, and its other actions have been
denounced by some members of the Non-Aligned Movement as attempts to run
roughshod over the sovereignty of smaller nations; at the most recent summit,
Kim Yong-nam, chairman of North Korea's parliamentary standing committee,
stated, "The United States is attempting to deprive other countries of even
their legitimate right to peaceful nuclear activities."

### NAM Centres

#### Centre for South-South Technical Cooperation

The Non-Aligned Movement Centre for South-South Technical Cooperation (NAM
CSSTC) as an intergovernmental institution, which enables developing countries
to increase national capacity and their collective self-reliance, forms part
of the efforts of NAM. The NAM CSSTC is located in Jakarta, Indonesia with a
South-South Technical Cooperation focus. The NAM CSSTC was set up a few years
after the Cold War to promote development in developing countries and to
accelerate growth. From 18 to 20 October 1995, in Cartagena de Indias, 140
nations gathered and accepted a final document stating in paragraph 313 of the
Final Document the establishment of the Centre for South-South Technical
Cooperation in Indonesia.

The organization aims to achieve the development goal of developing countries
to achieve sustainable human development and enable developing countries to be
equal partners in international relations, in accordance with the Final
Document.

The NAM CSSTC's main body is the board of directors. In addition, the Board of
Directors has a consultative arrangement with a Governing Council under the
leadership of the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of
Indonesia and its members include Ambassador of Brunei, Ambassador of Cuba and
Ambassador of South Africa. The head of the administrative officer of NAM
CSSTC is accredited by Ronny Prasetyo Yuliantoro, Director, current Indonesian
diplomat and Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to the Islamic Republic
of Iran, who began his term of office on 1 July 2018. The organization is
financed by Indonesia's volunteer contributions. The NAM CSSTC, its officers,
consists of a full-time staff who are not affiliated with any other
governmental institution except their head of the administrative officer, who
is typically nominated from Echelon-I or Echelon-II staff from the Indonesian
ministries. Some say the organization is a major endeavour to build NAM member
countries' capacities.

##### History

A few years before the NAM CSSTC was set up, the NAM summit in 1992 in Jakarta
to discuss efforts to strengthen collective autonomy and to review of the
international economic environment in order to step up South-South
cooperation.

After the admission of Brunei Darussalam to the NAM during the summit, the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia called for a South-South Technical
Cooperation Centre (now known as the NAM CSSTC) to be established by the
Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of Brunei
Darussalam with the aim of organizing different training, research and seminar
programmes and activities. The programme activities, aimed at eradicating
poverty, encouraging SMEs and the application of information communication
technologies.

##### Programmes

The NAM CSSTC carries out its activities through cooperation with NAM member
countries' training centres and specialists and other multilateral
organizations. Examples include Workshop on IUU fishing eradication, dispatch
of agricultural experts to Myanmar and international tissue culture training.

##### Evaluations

NAM CSSTC reports quarterly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic
of Indonesia and the NAM Coordinating Bureau in New York. Annually, the
Ministry and the Bureau will be given additional details on programmes and
events, including their assessments.

Other NAM Centres focus on the health, human rights (Center for Human Rights
and Cultural Diversity) and technology (Centre for Science and Technology of
the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries) sectors are each located in
Cuba, Iran and India.

Non-Aligned Movement Youth Organization (NAMYO) was established in October
2021.

### Cultural diversity and human rights

The movement accepts the universality of human rights and social justice, but
fiercely resists cultural homogenization.[_citation needed_] In line with its
views on sovereignty, the organization appeals for the protection of cultural
diversity, and the tolerance of the religious, socio-cultural, and historical
particularities that define human rights in a specific region. [_failed

A variety of ministerial meetings are held between the summit meetings. Some
are specialists, such as the meeting on "Inter-Faith Dialogue and Co-operation
for Peace", held in Manila, the Philippines, 16–18 March 2010. There is a
general Conference of Foreign Ministers every three years. The most recent
were in Bali, Indonesia, 23–27 May 2011 and Algiers, Algeria, 26–29 May 2014.

The 7th Summit was originally planned for September 1982 in Baghdad, the Iraqi
capital, during the Iran-Iraq War. On 21 July of that year, the Islamic
Republic of Iran Air Force executed the "Baghdad Operation", an effort to
disrupt that proposal by showing Baghdad's airspace was unsafe. Two McDonnell
Douglas F-4 Phantom II planes bombarded Al-Dura refinery with Mk82 bombs. One
plane returned damaged and the other (along with its pilot) was lost to Iraqi
defensive fire. Combined with threats by an Iranian-backed terror group to
kill the visiting heads of state, the effort was successful. On 11 August,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein announced that he would support Cuba's
suggestion of a summit in New Delhi to be held in 1983. "Iraq will take part
in the conference even if held in Tehran... We propose that the seventh
conference be held in India."

The Non-Aligned Movement celebrated its 50th anniversary in Belgrade on 5–6
September 2011.

An online summit titled "United Against Covid-19" conducted on 4 May 2020, on
the initiative of the chairman of the NAM for the 2019–2022 period, addressed
mainly the global struggle to fight the COVID-19 pandemics and supporting NAM
to increase its role in dealing with and mitigating the outcomes caused by
this disease in NAM, as well as other countries.

The Non-Aligned Movement celebrated its 60th anniversary in Belgrade, on 11–12
October 2021.

The Coordinating Bureau, also based at the UN, is the main instrument for
directing the work of the movement's task forces, committees and working
