Specialized body of the United Nations

The **United Nations Economic and Social Commission for West Asia** (**ESCWA**
; Arabic: الإسكوا) is one of five regional commissions under the jurisdiction
of the United Nations Economic and Social Council. The role of the Commission
is to promote economic and social development of Western Asia through regional
and subregional cooperation and integration.

The Commission is composed of 21 member states, all from the regions of North
Africa and the Middle East.

The Commission works closely with the divisions of the Headquarters in New
York and United Nations specialized agencies, as well as with international
and regional organizations. The League of Arab States, the Gulf Cooperation
Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation are among its regional
partners.

## History

The Commission was first established by the United Nations Economic and Social
Council on 9 August 1973 as the _United Nations Economic Commission for
Western Asia (ECWA)_. The Commission was the successor to the _United Nations
Economic and Social Office in Beirut (UNESOB)_ , which was absorbed into the
framework of ECWA. Its main mandate was to "initiate and participate in
measures for facilitating concerted action for the economic reconstruction and
development of Western Asia."

On 26 July 1985, in recognition of the social component of its work, the
Commission was renamed to the _United Nations Economic and Social Commission
for Western Asia (ESCWA)_ by the Economic and Social Council.

## Funding

The budget of Commission comes mainly from contributions from the United
Nations, but also from donations from governments, regional funds, private
foundations and international development agencies. In 2017, the total budget
of the Commission was US$27.4 million. Additionally, since 2014, the
Commission has received $7.1 million in voluntary contributions to help
implement national and regional activities.

The Commission has four main budgets: the regular budget, the regular
programme of technical cooperation (RPTC), the development account and the
extrabudgetary projects account:

  1. The _regular budget_ line item is voted on by the United Nations General Assembly on a biennial basis and provides the Commission with resources fulfil its mandate as laid out in the Strategic Framework. In 2017, the regular budget for ESCWA was $19.9 million.
  2. The _regular programme of technical cooperation_ line item works to support member states in formulating sustainable socioeconomic development policies. In 2017, the regular programme of technical cooperation budget for ESCWA was $2.3 million.
  3. The _development account_ line item helps fund capacity building projects at national, subregional, regional and interregional levels. In 2017, the development account budget for ESCWA was $1.9 million.
  4. The _extra budgetary projects_ line item supports economic and social development under the seven subprograms of the Commission: Economic Development and Integration, Gender and Women Issues, Governance and Conflict Issues, Natural Resources, Social Development, Statistics and Technology for Development. In 2017, the extra budgetary projects budget for ESCWA was $3.2 million.

## Themes and programs

### Implementing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The ESCWA launched the _Climate/SDGs Debt Swap–Donor Nexus Initiative_ in
December 2020. It is directed at debt relief and at enhancing fiscal space of
(middle-income) countries. This mechanism systematizes debt swaps, which allow
creditors to convert debt-serving payments into domestic investments for
indebted countries. Debtors thereby invest in climate or SDG-related programs,
while creditors may claim higher amounts of official development assistance or
climate finance without expanding their budgets.

### Women in the judiciary system

In 2019, ESCWA reported regarding the situation of women in the judiciary
system. The report found that "the number of female judges has significantly
increased in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon, the State of Palestine,
Morocco and Tunisia". However, "women’s presence remains marginal in most
other Arab States". At that time, two countries had not appointed female
judges yet: Oman and Somalia.

Other countries which already had female judges were: Iraq (1959), Morocco
(1961), Algeria (1962), Sudan (1965 or 1976), Lebanon and Tunisia (1966),
Yemen (1971), Syria (1975), Palestine (1982), Libya (1991), Jordan (1996),
Egypt (2003), Bahrain (2006), the United Arab Emirates (2008), Qatar (2010),
Mauritania (2013), and Kuwait (2020). In June 2021, Egypt announced that
female judges would take seats in Public Prosecution and State Council in
October that year.

## Controversies

### Israel-Palestine report controversy

On 15 March 2017, UNESCWA released a report accusing Israel (not a UNESCWA
member state) of being an "apartheid regime" due to Israel's relations with
Palestinians both inside and outside Israel. The report was officially
withdrawn and removed from UN websites after criticism from the Secretary-
General who said it had been issued by ESCWA without approval.

The document was co-authored by Richard Falk, professor of International Law
and Practice Emeritus at Princeton University and a former UN human rights
investigator for the Palestinian territories, and Virginia Tilley, professor
of Political Science at Southern Illinois University. It criticised Israel's
law of return for Jews. Falk and Tilley wrote: "Israel defends its rejection
of the Palestinians' return in frankly racist language: alleging that
Palestinians constitute a 'demographic threat' and that their return would
alter the demographic character of Israel to the point of eliminating it as a
Jewish state".

Rima Khalaf, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of
ESCWA, had said it was the first to accuse Israel of being a racist state
which had established an apartheid system. The report itself said it had
established on the "basis of scholarly inquiry and overwhelming evidence, that
Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid". Israel has condemned the report.
"We expected of course that Israel and its allies would put huge pressure on
the Secretary-General of the United Nations so that he would disavow the
report, and that they would ask him to withdraw it," Khalaf said to AFP.

UN Secretary-General António Guterres distanced himself from the report and
the document was removed from UN website on Friday, 17 March 2017. The
report's Executive Summary was also deleted from the United Nations
Information System on the Question of Palestine (UNISPAL).

On 17 March, Khalaf submitted her letter of resignation to Guterres. Following
the strong response from Israel, she wrote: "It is only normal for criminals
to pressure and attack those who advocate the cause of their victims." She
continued to stand by the report.
