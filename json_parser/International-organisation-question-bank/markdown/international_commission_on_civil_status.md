Intergovernmental organization

The **International Commission on Civil Status** , or ICCS (French:
_Commission internationale de l'état civil_ , or CIEC), is an
intergovernmental organisation whose aim is to promote international
cooperation in civil status matters and to improve the functioning of national
civil status services. It was provisionally founded in September 1948 in
Amsterdam, Netherlands, and officially recognised by an exchange of letters in
December 1949 and two protocols in 1950 and 1952. The organisation is seated
in Strasbourg, France, and its official language is French.

## Purpose

Founded after World War II in the context of millions of refugees, missing and
displaced people, the organisation's aim was to facilitate the cooperation
between states in establishing, recognising and validating civil status
documents, also known as vital records, such as birth, marriage and death
certificates. It did so by drafting international treaties such as the
Convention on the issue of multilingual extracts from civil status records,
which provides standard multilingual formats of vital records, allowing their
international acceptance without the need for translation or legalisation.
Later conventions drafted by the ICCS include the Convention on the
recognition of decisions recording a sex reassignment.

## Members

Current and former member states and observer states of the ICCS

The ICCS was created by five founding member states in 1948. In 1952, a
protocol opened the organisation to accession by any state. By 1999, 11 more
states had acceded to the ICCS, reaching a peak of 16 member states. After
2007, only one more state acceded and 12 states left the organisation,
resulting in only five member states by 2022. In 2024, the Francophone Notary
Association, representing 28 states, joined the organisation as a non-state
member.
