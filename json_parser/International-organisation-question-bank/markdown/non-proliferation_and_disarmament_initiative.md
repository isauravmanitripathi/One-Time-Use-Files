The **Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Initiative** (NPDI) is a coalition of
states within the framework of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)
formed in 2010.

In the Hague in 2013

## History

The coalition was formed in an effort to help implement the Final Document of
the 2010 NPT Review Conference, freshly adopted by consensus. It aims to:

  * encouraging greater transparency surrounding nuclear disarmament efforts
  * addressing the lack of substantive work in the Conference on Disarmament across the four core issue on its agenda
  * increasing support for and conclusion of key legal instruments that safeguard and govern nuclear activities and strengthening the NPT regime

On April 12, 2014, the twelve member countries denounced North Korea's atomic
program in the recent live-fire drills near the disputed border with South
Korea. The coalition issued a statement condemning North Korea' nuclear and
ballistic missile programmes and invited the said country to return to
compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement and the Nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
