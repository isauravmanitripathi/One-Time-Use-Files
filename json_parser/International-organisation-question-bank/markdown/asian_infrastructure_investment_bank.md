Multilateral development bank

The **Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank** (**AIIB**) is a multilateral
development bank and international financial institution that aims to
collectively improve economic and social outcomes in Asia. It is the world's
second largest multi-lateral development institution. Headquartered in
Beijing, China, the bank currently has 110 members, including 12 prospective
members from around the world. The breakdown of the 110 members by continents
are as follows: 42 in Asia, 26 in Europe, 22 in Africa, 10 in Oceania, 8 in
South America, and 2 in North America. The bank started operation after the
agreement entered into force on 25 December 2015, after ratifications were
received from 10 member states holding a total number of 50% of the initial
subscriptions of the Authorized Capital Stock.

The United Nations has addressed the launch of AIIB as having potential for
"scaling up financing for sustainable development" and to improve the global
economic governance. The starting capital of the bank was US$100 billion,
equivalent to 2⁄3 of the capital of the Asian Development Bank and about half
that of the World Bank. The bank was first proposed by China in 2013 and the
initiative was launched at a ceremony in Beijing in October 2014. It has since
received the highest credit ratings from the three biggest rating agencies in
the world, and has been seen since its inception as a potential rival or an
alternative to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

The proposal for the creation of an "Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank" was
first made by the Vice Chairman of the China Center for International Economic
Exchanges, a Chinese government think tank, at the Bo'ao Forum in April 2009.
The initial context was to make better use of Chinese foreign currency
reserves during the 2008 financial crisis.

The initiative was officially launched by General Secretary of the Chinese
Communist Party Xi Jinping on a state visit to Indonesia in October 2013. The
Chinese government has been frustrated with what it regards as the slow pace
of reforms and governance, and wants greater input in global established
institutions like the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank which it
claims are heavily dominated by American, European and Japanese interests.

At inception, the AIIB was explicitly linked to China's Belt and Road
Initiative. The AIIB was subsequently broadened to include investments with
states that are not involved with the BRI and its mission characterized more
generally as building "infrastructure for tomorrow," with a focus on green
infrastructure and connectivity.

In April 2014, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivered a keynote speech at the
opening of the Boao Forum for Asia and said that China was ready to intensify
consultations with relevant parties in and outside Asia on the preparations
for the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

The Asian Development Bank Institute published a report in 2010 which said
that the region requires $8 trillion to be invested from 2010 to 2020 in
infrastructure for the region to continue economic development. In a 2014
editorial, _The Guardian_ newspaper wrote that the new bank could allow
Chinese capital to finance these projects and allow it a greater role to play
in the economic development of the region commensurate with its growing
economic and political clout. But until March 2015, China in the ADB has only
5.47 percent voting right, while Japan and US have a combined 26 percent
voting right (13 percent each) with a share in subscribed capital of 15.7
percent and 15.6 percent, respectively. Dominance by both countries and slow
reforms underlie China's wish to establish the AIIB, while both countries
worry about China's increasing influence.

In June 2014 China proposed doubling the registered capital of the bank from
$50 billion to $100 billion and invited India to participate in the founding
of the bank. Thank was founded in Beijing in October 2014. On 24 October 2014,
twenty-one countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the
AIIB in Beijing, China: Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Kazakhstan,
Kuwait, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mongolia, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines,
Qatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Indonesia's
joining was slightly delayed due to their new presidential administration not
being able to review the membership in time. Indonesia signed the MOU on 25
November 2014.

The U.S. allegedly tried to keep Australia and South Korea from becoming
prospective founding members, after they expressed an interest in it. However,
both Australia and South Korea applied to join the bank in March 2015.

Hong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang announced in his budget speech in
February 2015 that the territory would join the AIIB. It did however not
become one of the prospective founding members and negotiated as part of the
Chinese delegation.

In early March 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George
Osborne, announced that the UK had decided to apply to join the Bank, becoming
the third Western country to do so after Luxembourg and New Zealand. The
announcement was criticised by the U.S. Obama Administration. A US government
official told _Financial Times_ , "We are wary about a trend toward constant
accommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power."
The official further stated that the British decision was taken after "no
consultation with the US." In response, the UK indicated that the subject had
been discussed between Chancellor Osborne and US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew
for several months preceding the decision. It was further stated that joining
the bank as a founding member would allow the UK to influence the development
of the institution. By encouraging Chinese investments in the next generations
of nuclear power plants, Osborne announced that "the City of London would
become the base for the first clearing house for the yuan outside Asia."

Following the criticism, the White House National Security Council, in a
statement to _The Guardian_ , declared,

> Our position on the AIIB remains clear and consistent. The United States and
> many major global economies all agree there is a pressing need to enhance
> infrastructure investment around the world. We believe any new multilateral
> institution should incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and the
> regional development banks. Based on many discussions, we have concerns
> about whether the AIIB will meet these high standards, particularly related
> to governance, and environmental and social safeguards [...] The
> international community has a stake in seeing the AIIB complement the
> existing architecture, and to work effectively alongside the World Bank and
> Asian Development Bank.

After the UK's decision to join the AIIB, a surge of new applications
followed, including several other European states – including Germany, France
and Italy – with a total number reaching 53 by the end of March. German
Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble stated, "We want to contribute our long-
standing experience with international financial institutions to the creation
of the new bank by setting high standards and helping the bank to get a high
international reputation." In March 2015, the South Korean Ministry of
Strategy and Finance announced that it, too, is planning to join the AIIB,
citing its potential in helping South Korean companies win deals in
infrastructural projects as well expanding South Korea's influence in
international banking as a founding member. States could indicate their
interest in becoming a Prospective Founding Member until 31 March 2015.

Negotiations took place in the framework of five Chief Negotiators Meetings
(CNMs) which took place between November 2014 and May 2015. The Articles of
Agreement, the legal framework of the bank, were concluded in the fifth CNM.
It was signed on 29 June 2015 by 50 of the named 57 prospective founding
members in Beijing, while the other seven signed later.

On 25 December 2015, the Articles of Agreement entered into force. On 16
January 2016, the board of governors of the bank convened its inaugural
meeting in Beijing and declared the bank open for business. Jin Liqun was
elected as the bank's president for a five-year term. 17 states (Australia,
Austria, Brunei, China, Georgia, Germany, Jordan, Luxembourg, Mongolia,
Myanmar, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore, South
Korea and the United Kingdom) together holding 50.1% of the initial
subscriptions of Authorized Capital Stock, had deposited the instrument of
ratification for the agreement, triggering entry into force, and making them
all founding members and bringing the Articles of Agreement, the bank's
charter, into force. 35 other states followed later, taking the amount of
Authorized Capital Stock held by the 29 members of the bank to 74%.

### AIIB within PRC policy thinking

#### Fostering long-term economic development

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank can be construed as a natural inter-
national extension of the infrastructure-driven economic development framework
that has sustained the rapid economic growth of China since the adoption of
the Chinese economic reform under Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. It stems from
the notion that long-term economic growth can only be achieved through
systematic, and broad-based investments in infrastructure assets – in contrast
with the more short-term "export-driven" and "domestic consumption"
development models favored by mainstream Western Neoclassical economists and
pursued by many developing countries in the 1990s and the first decade of the
21st century with generally disappointing results.

#### Infrastructure as regional integration and foreign policy tool

In his 29 March 2015 speech at the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) annual
conference, Xi Jinping said:

> [T]he Chinese economy is deeply integrated with the global economy and forms
> an important driving force of the economy of Asia and even the world at
> large. […] China's investment opportunities are expanding. Investment
> opportunities in infrastructure connectivity as well as in new technologies,
> new products, new business patterns, and new business models are constantly
> springing up. […] China's foreign cooperation opportunities are expanding.
> We support the multilateral trading system, devote ourselves to the Doha
> Round negotiations, advocate the Asia-Pacific free trade zone, promote
> negotiations on regional comprehensive economic partnership, advocate the
> construction of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), boost
> economic and financial cooperation in an all-round manner, and work as an
> active promoter of economic globalization and regional integration.

Xi insisted also that the Silk Road Fund and the Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank would foster "economic connectivity and a new-type of
industrialization [in the Asia Pacific area], and [thus] promote the common
development of all countries as well as the peoples' joint enjoyment of
development fruits."

Academic Suisheng Zhao writes that China's launching of the AIIB was intended
by China to reduce tensions caused by the United States' efforts to delay
reform of the Bretton Woods system, intended to provide international public
goods, and intended to provide China with increased participation in
international rule-making.

## Legal basis and membership

The Articles of Agreement form the legal basis for the Bank. 57 Prospective
Founding Members (PFM) named in annex A of the agreement are eligible to sign
and ratify the Articles, thus becoming a member of the Bank. Other states,
which are parties to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
or the Asian Development Bank may become members after approval of their
accession by the bank.

The Articles were negotiated by the Prospective Founding Members, with Hong
Kong joining the negotiations via China.

### Members

The 57 Prospective Founding Members can become Founding Members through:

  * Signing the Articles of Agreement in 2015
  * Ratifying the Articles of Agreement in 2015 or 2016

All Prospective Founding Members have signed the Articles, 52 of which have
ratified them, comprising 92% of the shares of all PFM. The formal actions
towards becoming a Founding Member are shown below, as well as the percentage
of the votes and of the shares, in the event all prospective founding states
become parties, and no other members are accepted.

In March 2017, 13 other states were granted prospective membership: 5 regional
(Afghanistan, Armenia, Fiji, Timor Leste and Hong Kong, China) and 8 non-
regional: Belgium, Canada, Ethiopia, Hungary, Ireland, Peru, Sudan and
Venezuela. In May 2017, 7 states were granted prospective membership: 3
regional (Bahrain, Cyprus, Samoa) and 4 non-regional (Bolivia, Chile, Greece,
Romania). In June 2017, 3 other states were granted prospective membership: 1
regional (Tonga) and 2 non-regional (Argentina, Madagascar). In 2018, 7 other
states were granted prospective membership: 1 regional (Lebanon) and 6 non-
regional (Algeria, Ghana, Libya, Morocco, Serbia, Togo). In 2019, 9 other
states were granted prospective membership: 9 non-regional (Djibouti, Rwanda,
Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Tunisia, Uruguay, Croatia, Senegal). In 2020,
Liberia were granted prospective membership. In 2021, 2 states were granted
prospective membership:1 regional (Iraq) and 1 non-regional (Nigeria). In
2023, 4 states were granted prospective membership: 4 non-regional
(Mauritania, El Salvador, Solomon Islands, Tanzania). They become members
after finishing their domestic procedures. As of July 2025, the total number

Regional members

#### Dependent territories

The Articles of Agreement provide for non-sovereign entities to become members
of the bank. In addition to the requirements for sovereign states, the
membership of dependent territories must be supported by the state responsible
for its external relations.

### Non-members

The Czech Republic, Nigeria, Iraq, Colombia, Ukraine are considering joining
the AIIB as members. Mexico, Japan and the United States have no immediate
intention to participate. Taiwan's request to become a Prospective Founding
Member was rejected by China as it does not consider the former to be a
sovereign state.

Taiwan

  * Taiwan applied for PFM to join the AIIB via Taiwan Affairs Office on 31 March 2015, possibly under the name "Chinese Taipei", but was rejected by the Multilateral Interim Secretariat of the AIIB on 13 April, without any reason stated. However, mainland China claims that there is the possibility for Taiwan to obtain membership at a later date. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that Taiwan should avoid creating a "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" situation. ROC Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ford announced in April 2016 that Taiwan was not being treated with "dignity" or "respect" during the registration process and Taiwan eventually chose to leave the decision to join to the new president.

United States – **No commitment**

  * The United States' officials have expressed concerns about whether the AIIB would have high standards of governance, and whether it would have environmental and social safeguards. The United States is reported to have used diplomatic pressure to try and prevent key allies, such as Australia, from joining the bank, and expressed disappointment when others, such as Britain, joined. The US' opposition to the AIIB, as well as its attempt to dissuade allies from joining was seen as a manifestation of a multifaceted containment strategy.

Japan – **"Under Consideration" / No commitment**

  * Masato Kitera, Tokyo's envoy in Beijing, stated previously that Japan might join the AIIB. Japanese Finance Minister Tarō Asō previously indicated interest in joining the AIIB, but later switched his stance. Yoshihide Suga, Japan's Cabinet Secretary, told the public that Japan was still seeking China's full explanation of the AIIB as he stated, "As of today, Japan will not join AIIB and a clear explanation has not been received from China" and "Japan is dubious about whether (the AIIB) would be properly governed or whether it would damage other creditors". He also stated that Japan is no longer considering whether or not to join the bank. The Japanese Government Spokesman also announced that Japan would not join the AIIB. Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe also added that Japan does not need to join the bank. But two years later, in May 2017, Shinzō Abe said joining the AIIB, created in part to fund the initiative, could be an option if governance questions were resolved. Toshihiro Nikai, secretary-general of the ruling party Liberal Democratic Party, suggested joining the AIIB.

## Shareholding structure

The Authorized Capital Stock of the bank is $100 billion (US dollars), divided
into 1 million shares of $100,000 each. Twenty percent are paid-in shares (and
thus have to be transferred to the bank), and 80% are callable shares. The
allocated shares are based on the size of each member country's economy
(calculated using GDP Nominal (60%) and GDP PPP (40%)) and whether they are an
Asian or Non-Asian Member. The total number of shares will determine the
fraction of authorized capital in the bank. Of the prospective founding
members, three states decided not to subscribe to all allocated shares:
Malaysia, Portugal, and Singapore, resulting in 98% of available shares being
subscribed.

Three categories of votes exist: basic votes, share votes and Founding Member
votes. The basic votes are equal for all members and constitute 12% of the
total votes, while the share votes are equal to the number of shares. Each
Founding Member furthermore gets 600 votes. An overview of the shares,
assuming when all 57 Prospective Founding Members have become Founding Members
is shown below (values in bold do not depend on the number of members):

Vote Type | % of Total Votes | Total Votes | Vote per Member | China

Total | **100** | 1,154,224 | varies | 300,834 (26.1%) | 3,102 (0.3%)   
  
## Governance

Name plaque of AIIB at its global headquarters in Beijing

The bank's governance structure is composed of the Board of Governors as the
top-level and highest decision-making body. It is composed of 1 governor for
each member state of the bank and in principle meets once a year. The board of
directors, composed of 12 governors, each representing one or more member is
responsible for daily operations and tasks delegated to it by the board of
governors. Nine of those members are from within the Asia-Pacific region and
three representing members outside the region.

Of the non-regional directors, 1 constituency is made up of EU member states
having the Euro as their currency, and 1 from other European countries.

New members are considered for admission only once a year. An overview of the
constituencies is shown below:

## Reception

The former President of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, has said that the need
for infrastructure in developing countries is great so that the activities of
new organizations would be welcome. The World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development
bank have all cooperated with the AIIB as a complement to the Bretton Woods
institutions and which further increases overall capacity for development
funds.

Economist C. Fred Bergsten describes the AIIB as "helping meet a clear need
for more infrastructure funding throughout Asia (and elsewhere)." He concludes
that the AIIB "has adhered to internationally agreed norms and best practices,
and is innovating some of its own." Additionally, Bergsten writes that China's
role in the AIIB "has clearly met the U.S. request for China to function as a
'responsible stakeholder' in the world economy."

### Geopolitical implication in Asia-Pacific and beyond

There is no consensus in the United States about the role of the AIIB. John
Ikenberry sees the AIIB as part of "China's emerging institutional
statecraft," but argues that it is not clear whether the institution will tie
China more deeply into the existing order or become a vehicle to challenge the
order. Phillip Lipscy (Stanford University) argues that the United States and
Japan should support the AIIB to encourage China's peaceful global leadership
and discourage China from pursuing coercive or military options. On the other
hand, Paola Subacchi (Chatham House) argues that the AIIB represents a threat
to US-dominated global governance.

Think-tanks such as Chatham House, the China Studies Centre at the University
of Sydney and the World Pensions Council (WPC) have argued that the successful
establishment of a new supranational financial powerhouse headquartered in PRC
would be facilitated by the large number of participating developed economies.
These experts observe that the establishment of the Beijing-based AIIB does
not necessitate rivalry, when economic cooperation is possible, and that the
decision by the UK to participate advances its own interests even if some of
its allies are opposed.

### Environmental record

Although the proposed bank declared "AIIB will learn from the best practice in
the world and adopt international standards of environmental protection,"
Oxford scholar of economics and energy policy Yuge Ma has argued that this may
be complicated in developing Asian countries.

### Political influence

In June 2023, Bob Pickard, a Canadian national and the global communications
director and official spokesperson of AIIB resigned, and fled from China.
Pickard said that the AIIB was dominated by Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
members who operate as an in-house secret police. He also claimed that all
information going to AIIB's president, Jin Liqun, was filtered through those
CCP officials, whose offices were the closest to Jin. Pickard went on to state
that the AIIB has one of the most toxic cultures imaginable. Later the same
day, Chrystia Freeland, the Deputy Prime Minister of Canada and Finance
Minister announced that Canada is freezing ties with the AIIB while carrying
out an investigation of the allegations and Canada's involvement in the AIIB.
In the following day, the AIIB launched an internal investigation and welcomed
the Canadian review, but called the allegation "baseless." In December 2023,
the Canadian Finance Ministry announced that it would be expanding its
investigation to include "an analysis of AIIB investments, its governance and
management frameworks, as well as an examination of whether its environmental
and social governance safeguards are effective and sufficient".

In the United Kingdom, AIIB faced criticism for having seconded HM Treasury
staff. Conservative MP Tim Loughton, who was impacted by a Chinese cyber
campaign, called for an audit of the UK's relationship with the AIIB.
According to a report by the Intelligence and Security Committee of
Parliament, Sir Danny Alexander's appointment as vice-president of the AIIB
was partially influenced by the Chinese government, intending to lend
credibility to Chinese investments through his name.
