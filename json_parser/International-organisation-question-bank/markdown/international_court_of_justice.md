Primary judicial organ of the United Nations

The **International Court of Justice** (**ICJ** ; French: _Cour internationale
de justice_ , **CIJ**), or colloquially the **World Court** , is the principal
judicial organ of the United Nations (UN). It settles legal disputes submitted
to it by states and provides advisory opinions on legal questions referred to
it by other UN organs and specialized agencies. The ICJ is the only
international court that adjudicates general disputes between countries, with
its rulings and opinions serving as primary sources of international law. It
is one of the six principal organs of the United Nations.

Established in June 1945 by the Charter of the United Nations, the Court began
work in April 1946. It is the successor to the Permanent Court of
International Justice (PCIJ), which was established by the League of Nations
in 1920. Its founding statute is an integral part of the UN Charter and draws
heavily from that of its predecessor. All UN member states are automatically
parties to the ICJ Statute. However, the Court's jurisdiction in contentious
cases is founded upon the consent of the states party to a dispute, which may
be given through special agreements or declarations accepting the Court's
compulsory jurisdiction.

The Court is composed of a panel of 15 judges elected by the UN General
Assembly and Security Council for nine-year terms. The composition of the
bench is required to represent the "main forms of civilization and the
principal legal systems of the world," and no two judges may be nationals of
the same country. The ICJ is seated in the Peace Palace in The Hague,
Netherlands, making it the only principal UN organ not located in New York
City. Its official working languages are English and French.

Since its first case was submitted in 1947, the Court has entertained 191
cases as of November 2023. While its judgments are binding on the parties and
final, the ICJ possesses no formal enforcement mechanism. Enforcement of its
rulings is ultimately a political matter for the UN Security Council, where it
is subject to the veto power of the five permanent members.

## History

The first permanent institution established for the purpose of settling
international disputes was the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), which was
created by the Hague Peace Conference of 1899. Initiated by the Russian Tsar
Nicholas II, the conference involved all the world's major powers, as well as
several smaller states, and resulted in the first multilateral treaties
concerned with the conduct of warfare. Among these was the _Convention for the
Pacific Settlement of International Disputes_ , which set forth the
institutional and procedural framework for arbitral proceedings, which would
take place in The Hague, Netherlands. Although the proceedings would be
supported by a permanent bureau—whose functions would be equivalent to that of
a secretariat or court registry—the arbitrators would be appointed by the
disputing states from a larger pool provided by each member of the convention.
The PCA was established in 1900 and began proceedings in 1902.

A second Hague Peace Conference in 1907, which involved most of the world's
sovereign states, revised the convention and enhanced the rules governing
arbitral proceedings before the PCA. During this conference, the United
States, Great Britain and Germany submitted a joint proposal for a permanent
court whose judges would serve full-time. As the delegates could not agree how
the judges would be selected, the matter was shelved pending an agreement to
be adopted at a later convention.

The Hague Peace Conferences, and the ideas that emerged therefrom, influenced
the creation of the Central American Court of Justice, which was established
in 1908 as one of the earliest regional judicial bodies. Various plans and
proposals were made between 1911 and 1919 for the establishment of an
international judicial tribunal, which would not be realized in the formation
of a new international system following the First World War.

### The Permanent Court of International Justice

The unprecedented bloodshed of the First World War led to the creation of the
League of Nations, established by the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 as the
first worldwide intergovernmental organization aimed at maintaining peace and
collective security. Article 14 League's Covenant called for the establishment
of a Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), which would be
responsible for adjudicating any international dispute submitted to it by the
contesting parties, as well as to provide an advisory opinion upon any dispute
or question referred to it by the League of Nations.

In December 1920, following several drafts and debates, the Assembly of the
league unanimously adopted the statute of the PCIJ, which was signed and
ratified the following year by a majority of members. Among other things, the
new Statute resolved the contentious issues of selecting judges by providing
that the judges be elected by both the council and the Assembly of the league
concurrently but independently. The makeup of the PCIJ would reflect the "main
forms of civilization and the principal legal systems of the world". The PCIJ
would be permanently placed at the Peace Palace in The Hague, alongside
Permanent Court of Arbitration.

The PCIJ represented a major innovation in international jurisprudence in
several ways:

  * Unlike previous international arbitral tribunals, it was a permanent body governed by its statutory provisions and rules of procedure
  * It had a permanent registry that served as a liaison with governments and international bodies
  * Its proceedings were largely public, including pleadings, oral arguments, and all documentary evidence
  * It was accessible to all states and could be declared by states to have compulsory jurisdiction over disputes
  * The PCIJ Statute was the first to list sources of law it would draw upon, which in turn became sources of international law
  * Judges were more representative of the world and its legal systems than any prior international judicial body

Unlike the ICJ, the PCIJ was not part of the league, nor were members of the
league automatically a party to its Statute. The United States, which played a
key role in both the second Hague Peace Conference and the Paris Peace
Conference, was notably not a member of the league. However, several of its
nationals served as judges of the court.

From its first session in 1922 until 1940, the PCIJ dealt with 29 interstate
disputes and issued 27 advisory opinions. The court's widespread acceptance
was reflected by the fact that several hundred international treaties and
agreements conferred jurisdiction upon it over specified categories of
disputes. In addition to helping resolve several serious international
disputes, the PCIJ helped clarify several ambiguities in international law
that contributed to its development.

The United States played a major role in setting up the PCIJ but never joined.
Presidents Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, Hoover, and Roosevelt all supported
membership, but did not get the two-thirds majority in the Senate required for
a treaty.

### Establishment of the International Court of Justice

Following a peak of activity in 1933, the PCIJ began to decline in its
activities due to the growing international tension and isolationism that
characterized the era. The Second World War effectively put an end to the
court, which held its last public session in December 1939 and issued its last
orders in February 1940. In 1942 the United States and United Kingdom jointly
declared support for establishing or re-establishing an international court
after the war, and in 1943, the U.K. chaired a panel of jurists from around
the world, the "Inter-Allied Committee", to discuss the matter. Its 1944
report recommended that:

  * The statute of any new international court should be based on that of the PCIJ;
  * The new court should retain an advisory jurisdiction;
  * Acceptance of the new court's jurisdiction should be voluntary;
  * The court should deal only with judicial and not political matters

Several months later at the Moscow conference in 1943, the major Allied
Powers—China, the USSR, the U.K., and the U.S.—issued a joint declaration
recognizing the necessity "of establishing at the earliest practicable date a
general international organization, based on the principle of the sovereign
equality of all peace-loving States, and open to membership by all such
States, large and small, for the maintenance of international peace and
security".

The following Allied conference at Dumbarton Oaks, in the United States,
published a proposal in October 1944 that called for the establishment of an
intergovernmental organization that would include an international court. A
meeting was subsequently convened in Washington, D.C., in April 1945,
involving 44 jurists from around the world to draft a statute for the proposed
court. The draft statute was substantially similar to that of the PCIJ, and it
was questioned whether a new court should even be created. During the San
Francisco Conference, which took place from 25 April to 26 June 1945 and
involved 50 countries, it was decided that an entirely new court should be
established as a principal organ of the new United Nations. The statute of
this court would form an integral part of the United Nations Charter, which,
to maintain continuity, expressly held that the Statute of the International
Court of Justice (ICJ) was based upon that of the PCIJ.

Consequently, the PCIJ convened for the last time in October 1945 and resolved
to transfer its archives to its successor, which would take its place at the
Peace Palace. The judges of the PCIJ all resigned on 31 January 1946, with the
election of the first members of the ICJ taking place the following February
at the First Session of the United Nations General Assembly and Security
Council. In April 1946, the PCIJ was formally dissolved, and the ICJ, in its
first meeting, was elected President José Gustavo Guerrero of El Salvador, who
had served as the last president of the PCIJ. The court also appointed members
of its Registry, mainly drawn from that of the PCIJ, and held an inaugural
public sitting later that month.

The first case was submitted in May 1947 by the United Kingdom against Albania
concerning incidents in the Corfu Channel.

## Activities

The Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, seat of the ICJ

Established in 1945 by the UN Charter, the court began work in 1946 as the
successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice. The Statute of the
International Court of Justice, similar to that of its predecessor, is the
main constitutional document constituting and regulating the court.

The court's workload covers a wide range of judicial activity. After the court
ruled that the United States's covert war against Nicaragua was in violation
of international law (_Nicaragua v. United States_), the United States
withdrew from compulsory jurisdiction in 1986 to accept the court's
jurisdiction only on a discretionary basis. Chapter XIV of the United Nations
Charter authorizes the UN Security Council to enforce Court rulings. However,
such enforcement is subject to the veto power of the five permanent members of
the council, which the United States used in the _Nicaragua_ case.

## Composition

The ICJ is composed of fifteen judges elected to nine-year terms by the UN
General Assembly and the UN Security Council from a list of people nominated
by the national groups in the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The election
process is set out in Articles 4–19 of the ICJ Statute. Elections are
staggered, with five judges elected every three years to ensure continuity
within the court. Should a judge die in office, the practice has generally
been to elect a judge in a special election to complete the term.
Historically, deceased judges have been replaced by judges from the same
region, though not —as often wrongly asserted— necessarily from the same
nationality.

Article 3 states that no two judges may be nationals of the same country.
According to Article 9, the membership of the court is supposed to represent
the "main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the
world". This has been interpreted to include common law, civil law, socialist
law, and Islamic law, while the precise meaning of "main forms of
civilization" is contested.

There is an informal understanding that the seats will be distributed by
geographic regions so that there are five seats for Western countries, three
for African states (including one judge of Francophone civil law, one of
Anglophone common law and one Arab), two for Eastern European states, three
for Asian states and two for Latin American and Caribbean states. For most of
the court's history, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council (France, USSR, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States) have
always had a judge serving, thereby occupying three of the Western seats, one
of the Asian seats and one of the Eastern European seats. Exceptions have been
China not having a judge on the court from 1967 to 1985, during which time it
did not put forward a candidate, and British judge Sir Christopher Greenwood
being withdrawn as a candidate for election for a second nine-year term on the
bench in 2017, leaving no judges from the United Kingdom on the court.
Greenwood had been supported by the UN Security Council but failed to get a
majority in the UN General Assembly. Indian judge Dalveer Bhandari took the
seat instead.

Article 6 of the Statute provides that all judges should be "elected
regardless of their nationality among persons of high moral character" who are
either qualified for the highest judicial office in their home states or known
as lawyers with sufficient competence in international law. Judicial
independence is dealt with specifically in Articles 16–18.

To insure impartiality, Article 16 of the Charter requires independence from
their national governments or other interested parties, stating, "No member of
the Court may exercise any political or administrative function, or engage in
any other occupation of a professional nature." In addition, Article 17
requires that judges do not show any prior biases on cases before them,
specifically, "No member may participate in the decision of any case in which
he has previously taken part as agent, counsel, or advocate for one of the
parties, or as a member of a national or international court, or of a
commission of enquiry, or in any other capacity."

Judges of the International Court of Justice are entitled to the style of
His/Her Excellency. Judges are not able to hold any other post or act as
counsel. In practice, members of the court have their own interpretation of
these rules and many have chosen to remain involved in outside arbitration and
hold professional posts as long as there is no conflict of interest. Former
judge Bruno Simma and current judge Georg Nolte have acknowledged that
moonlighting should be restricted.

A judge can be dismissed only by a unanimous vote of the other members of the
court. Despite these provisions, the independence of ICJ judges has been
questioned. For example, during the _Nicaragua_ case, the United States issued
a communiqué suggesting that it could not present sensitive material to the
court because of the presence of judges from the Soviet bloc.

Judges may deliver joint judgments or give their own separate opinions.
Decisions and advisory opinions are by majority, and, in the event of an equal
division, the president's vote becomes decisive, which occurred in the
_Legality of the Use by a State of Nuclear Weapons in Armed Conflict_ (Opinion
requested by WHO), [1996] ICJ Reports 66. Judges may also deliver separate
dissenting opinions.

In its 77 years of history, only five women have been elected to the Court,
with former UN Special Rapporteur Philip Alston calling for states to take
seriously questions of representation in the bench.

In 2023, judges elected to take office from 2024 did not include a Russian
member, so for the first time, from 2024 there will be no member from the
Commonwealth of Independent States. This is also the first time that Russia
would not have a judge on the ICJ, even going back to its predecessor, the
Soviet Union.

### _Ad hoc_ judges

Article 31 of the statute sets out a procedure whereby _ad hoc_ judges sit on
contentious cases before the court. The system allows any party to a
contentious case (if it otherwise does not have one of that party's nationals
sitting on the court) to select one additional person to sit as a judge on
that case only. It is thus possible that as many as seventeen judges may sit
on one case.

The system may seem strange when compared with domestic court processes, but
its purpose is to encourage states to submit cases. For example, if a state
knows that it will have a judicial officer who can participate in deliberation
and offer other judges local knowledge and an understanding of the state's
perspective, it may be more willing to submit to the jurisdiction of the
court. Although this system does not sit well with the judicial nature of the
body, it is usually of little practical consequence. _Ad hoc_ judges usually
(but not always) vote in favour of the state that appointed them and thus
cancel each other out.

### Chambers

Generally, the court sits as full bench, but in the last fifteen years, it has
on occasion sat as a chamber. Articles 26–29 of the statute allow the court to
form smaller chambers, usually 3 or 5 judges, to hear cases. Two types of
chambers are contemplated by Article 26: firstly, chambers for special
categories of cases, and second, the formation of _ad hoc_ chambers to hear
particular disputes. In 1993, a special chamber was established, under Article
26(1) of the ICJ statute, to deal specifically with environmental matters
(although it has never been used).

_Ad hoc_ chambers are more frequently convened. For example, chambers were
used to hear the _Gulf of Maine Case_ (Canada/US). In that case, the parties
made clear they would withdraw the case unless the court appointed judges to
the chamber acceptable to the parties. Judgments of chambers may have either
less authority than full Court judgments or diminish the proper interpretation
of universal international law informed by a variety of cultural and legal
perspectives. On the other hand, the use of chambers might encourage greater
recourse to the court and thus enhance international dispute resolution.

## Jurisdiction

Parties upon becoming a UN member Parties prior to joining the UN under
Article 93 UN observer states that are not parties  
---  
  
As stated in Article 93 of the UN Charter, all 193 UN members are
automatically parties to the court's statute. Non-UN members may also become
parties to the court's statute under the Article 93(2) procedure, which was
used by Switzerland in 1948 and Nauru in 1988, prior to either joining the UN.
Once a state is a party to the court's statute, it is entitled to participate
in cases before the court. However, being a party to the statute does not
automatically give the court jurisdiction over disputes involving those
parties. The issue of jurisdiction is considered in the three types of ICJ
cases: contentious issues, incidental jurisdiction, and advisory opinions.

### Contentious issues

First gathering after Second World War, Dutch newsreel from 1946

In contentious cases (adversarial proceedings seeking to settle a dispute),
the ICJ produces a binding ruling between states that agree to submit to the
ruling of the court. Only states may be parties in contentious cases;
individuals, corporations, component parts of a federal state, NGOs, UN
organs, and self-determination groups are excluded from direct participation,
although the court may receive information from public international
organizations. However, this does not preclude non-state interests from being
the subject of proceedings; for example, a state may bring a case on behalf of
one of its nationals or corporations, such as in matters concerning diplomatic
protection.

Jurisdiction is often a crucial question for the court in contentious cases.
The key principle is that the ICJ has jurisdiction only on the basis of
consent. Under Article 36, there are four foundations for the court's
jurisdiction:

  1. _Compromis_ or "special agreement", in which parties provide explicit consent to the court's jurisdiction by referring cases to it. While not true compulsory jurisdiction, this is perhaps the most effective jurisdictional basis, because the parties concerned have a desire for the dispute to be resolved by the court, and are thus more likely to comply with the court's judgment.
  2. Compromissory clauses in a binding treaty. Most modern treaties contain such clauses to provide for dispute resolution by the ICJ. Cases founded on compromissory clauses have not been as effective as cases founded on special agreement, since a state may have no interest in having the matter examined by the court and may refuse to comply with a judgment. For example, during the Iran hostage crisis, Iran refused to participate in a case brought by the US based on a compromissory clause contained in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and did not comply with the judgment. Since the 1970s, the use of such clauses has declined; many modern treaties set out their own dispute resolution regime, often based on forms of arbitration.
  3. Optional clause declarations accepting the court's jurisdiction. Also known as Article 36(2) jurisdiction, it is sometimes misleadingly labeled "compulsory", though such declarations are voluntary. Many such declarations contain reservations that exclude from jurisdiction certain types of disputes (_ratione materia_). The principle of reciprocity may further limit jurisdiction, as Article 36(2) holds that such declaration may be made "in relation to any other State accepting the same obligation...". As of January 2018, seventy-four states had a declaration in force, up from sixty-six in February 2011; of the permanent Security Council members, only the United Kingdom has a declaration. In the court's early years, most declarations were made by industrialized countries. Since the 1986 _Nicaragua_ case, declarations made by developing countries have increased, reflecting a growing confidence in the court. However, even those industrialized countries that have invoked optional declarations have sometimes increased exclusions or rescinded them altogether. Notable examples include the United States in the _Nicaragua_ case, and Australia, which modified its declaration in 2002 to exclude disputes on maritime boundaries, most likely to prevent an impending challenge from East Timor, which gained independence two months later.
  4. Article 36(5) provides for jurisdiction on the basis of declarations made under the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice. Article 37 similarly transfers jurisdiction under any compromissory clause in a treaty that gave jurisdiction to the PCIJ.

Additionally, the court may have jurisdiction on the basis of tacit consent
(_forum prorogatum_). In the absence of clear jurisdiction under Article 36,
jurisdiction is established if the respondent accepts ICJ jurisdiction
explicitly or simply pleads on the merits. This arose in the 1949 Corfu
Channel Case (U.K. v. Albania), in which the court held that a letter from
Albania stating that it submitted to the jurisdiction of the ICJ was
sufficient to grant the court jurisdiction.[_citation needed_]

### Incidental jurisdiction

Until rendering a final judgment, the court has competence to order interim
measures for the protection of the rights of a party to a dispute. One or both
parties to a dispute may apply the ICJ for issuing interim measures. In the
_Frontier Dispute_ Case, both parties to the dispute, Burkina Faso and Mali,
submitted an application to the court to indicate interim measures. Incidental
jurisdiction of the court derives from the Article 41 of its Statute. Similar
to the final judgment, the order for interim measures of the court are binding
on state parties to the dispute. The ICJ has competence to indicate interim
measures only if the _prima facie_ jurisdiction is satisfied.[_citation
needed_]

### Advisory opinions

Audience of the "Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral
Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government
of Kosovo"

An advisory opinion is a function of the court open only to specified United
Nations bodies and agencies. The UN Charter grants the General Assembly or the
Security Council the power to request the court to issue an advisory opinion
on any legal question. Organs of the UN other than the General Assembly or the
Security Council require the General Assembly's authorization to request an
advisory opinion of the ICJ. These organs of the UN only request an advisory
opinion regarding the matters that fall within the scope of their activities.
On receiving a request, the court decides which states and organizations might
provide useful information and gives them an opportunity to present written or
oral statements. Advisory opinions were intended as a means by which UN
agencies could seek the court's help in deciding complex legal issues that
might fall under their respective mandates.

In principle, the court's advisory opinions are only consultative in character
but they are influential and widely respected. Certain instruments or
regulations can provide in advance that the advisory opinion shall be
specifically binding on particular agencies or states, but inherently they are
non-binding under the Statute of the court. This non-binding character does
not mean that advisory opinions are without legal effect, because the legal
reasoning embodied in them reflects the court's authoritative views on
important issues of international law. In arriving at them, the court follows
essentially the same rules and procedures that govern its binding judgments
delivered in contentious cases submitted to it by sovereign states.

An advisory opinion derives its status and authority from the fact that it is
the official pronouncement of the principal judicial organ of the United
Nations.

Advisory opinions have often been controversial because the questions asked
are controversial or the case was pursued as an indirect way of bringing what
is really a contentious case before the court. Examples of advisory opinions
can be found in the section advisory opinions in the List of International
Court of Justice cases article. One such well-known advisory opinion is the
_Nuclear Weapons Case_.

On 23 July 2025, the court issued an advisory opinion regarding the State
obligations in respect of climate change, upon request by the General Assembly
to address two questions: the obligations of States under international law to
protect the climate system from anthropogenic emissions for States and for
present and future generations, and the legal consequences arising where
states, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the
climate system and other parts of the environment. This was the biggest case
in the history of the court, with 99 countries and more than 12
intergovernmental organizations heard over two weeks in December 2024.

## Examples of contentious cases

  * 1980: A complaint by the United States that Iran was detaining American diplomats in Tehran in violation of international law.
  * 1982: A dispute between Tunisia and Libya over the delimitation of the continental shelf between them.
  * 1989: A complaint by Iran after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by a United States Navy guided missile cruiser.
  * 1984: A dispute over the course of the maritime boundary dividing the U.S. and Canada in the Gulf of Maine area.
  * 1999: A complaint by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization regarding their actions in the Kosovo War. This was denied on 15 December 2004 because of lack of jurisdiction, the FRY not being a party to the ICJ statute at the time it made the application.
  * 2005: A complaint by the Democratic Republic of the Congo that its sovereignty had been violated by Uganda and that the DRC had lost billions of dollars worth of resources was decided in favour of the DRC.
  * 2011: A complaint by the Republic of North Macedonia (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) that Greece's vetoing of its accession to NATO violates the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995 between the two countries. The complaint was decided in favour of North Macedonia on 5 December 2011.
  * 2017: A complaint by the Republic of India regarding a death penalty verdict against an Indian citizen, Kulbhushan Jadhav, by a Pakistani military court (based on alleged espionage and subversive activities).
  * 2022: A complaint by Ukraine against Russia for violating the 1948 Genocide Convention, to which both Ukraine and Russia are parties, by falsely claiming genocide as a pretext for invading Ukraine. The International Association of Genocide Scholars supported Ukraine, who asked for expedited provisional measures directing Russia to halt its offensive. Russian representatives refused to appear. On 16 March, the ICJ ordered Russia to "immediately suspend the military operations", on a 13–2 vote with the Russian and Chinese judges in opposition. The order is binding on Russia, but the ICJ cannot enforce it.

## Relationship with UN Security Council

Article 94 establishes the duty of all UN members to comply with decisions of
the court involving them. If parties do not comply, the issue may be taken
before the Security Council for enforcement action. There are obvious problems
with such a method of enforcement. If the judgment is against one of the five
permanent members of the Security Council or its allies, any resolution on
enforcement could then be vetoed by that member. That occurred, for example,
after the _Nicaragua_ case, when Nicaragua brought the issue of the United
States' noncompliance with the court's decision before the Security Council.
Furthermore, if the Security Council refuses to enforce a judgment against any
other state, there is no method of forcing the state to comply. Furthermore,
the most effective form to take action for the Security Council, coercive
action under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, can be justified only
if international peace and security are at stake. The Security Council has
never done that so far.[_citation needed_]

The relationship between the ICJ and the Security Council, and the separation
of their powers, was considered by the court in 1992 in the _Pan Am_ case. The
court had to consider an application from Libya for the order of provisional
measures of protection to safeguard its rights, which, it alleged, were being
infringed by the threat of economic sanctions by the United Kingdom and United
States. The problem was that these sanctions had been authorized by the
Security Council, which resulted in a potential conflict between the Chapter
VII functions of the Security Council and the judicial function of the court.
The court decided, by eleven votes to five, that it could not order the
requested provisional measures because the rights claimed by Libya, even if
legitimate under the 1971 Montreal Convention, could not be _prima facie_
regarded as appropriate since the action was ordered by the Security Council.
In accordance with Article 103 of the UN Charter, obligations under the
Charter took precedence over other treaty obligations. Nevertheless, the court
declared the application admissible in 1998. A decision on the merits has not
been given since the parties (United Kingdom, United States, and Libya)
settled the case out of court in 2003.[_citation needed_]

There was a marked reluctance on the part of a majority of the court to become
involved in a dispute in such a way as to bring it potentially into conflict
with the council. The court stated in the _Nicaragua_ case that there is no
necessary inconsistency between action by the Security Council and
adjudication by the ICJ. However, when there is room for conflict, the balance
appears to be in favour of the Security Council.[_citation needed_]

Should either party fail "to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a
judgment rendered by the Court", the Security Council may be called upon to
"make recommendations or decide upon measures" if the Security Council deems
such actions necessary. In practice, the court's powers have been limited by
the unwillingness of the losing party to abide by the court's ruling and by
the Security Council's unwillingness to impose consequences. However, in
theory, "so far as the parties to the case are concerned, a judgment of the
Court is binding, final and without appeal", and "by signing the Charter, a
State Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with any decision of
the International Court of Justice in a case to which it is a party."

For example, the United States had previously accepted the court's compulsory
jurisdiction upon its creation in 1946 but in 1984, after _Nicaragua v. United
States_ , withdrew its acceptance following the court's judgment that called
on the US to "cease and to refrain" from the "unlawful use of force" against
the government of Nicaragua. The court ruled (with only the American judge
dissenting) that the United States was "in breach of its obligation under the
Treaty of Friendship with Nicaragua not to use force against Nicaragua" and
ordered the United States to pay war reparations.

## Law applied

When deciding cases, the court applies international law as summarized in
Article 38 of the ICJ Statute, which provides that in arriving at its
decisions the court shall apply international conventions, international
custom and the "general principles of law recognized by civilized nations." It
may also refer to academic writing ("the teachings of the most highly
qualified publicists of the various nations") and previous judicial decisions
to help interpret the law although the court is not formally bound by its
previous decisions under the doctrine of _stare decisis_. Article 59 makes
clear that the common law notion of precedent or _stare decisis_ does not
apply to the decisions of the ICJ. The court's decision binds only the parties
to that particular controversy. Under 38(1)(d), however, the court may
consider its own previous decisions and frequently cites them.

If the parties agree, they may also grant the court the liberty to decide _ex
aequo et bono_ ("out of equality, and for the good"), granting the ICJ the
freedom to make an equitable decision based on what is fair under the
circumstances. That provision has not been used in the court's
history.[_when?_] So far,[_when?_] the International Court of Justice has
dealt with about 180 cases.

## Procedure

The ICJ is vested with the power to make its own rules. Court procedure is set
out in the _Rules of Court of the International Court of Justice 1978_ (as
amended on 29 September 2005).

Cases before the ICJ will follow a standard pattern. The case is lodged by the
applicant, which files a written memorial setting out the basis of the court's
jurisdiction and the merits of its claim. The respondent may accept the
court's jurisdiction and file its own memorial on the merits of the case.

### Preliminary objections

A respondent that does not wish to submit to the jurisdiction of the court may
raise preliminary objections. Any such objections must be ruled upon before
the court can address the merits of the applicant's claim. Often, a separate
public hearing is held on the preliminary objections and the court will render
a judgment. Respondents normally file preliminary objections to the
jurisdiction of the court and/or the admissibility of the case.
Inadmissibility refers to a range of arguments about factors the court should
take into account in deciding jurisdiction, such as the fact that the issue is
not justiciable or that it is not a "legal dispute".

In addition, objections may be made because all necessary parties are not
before the court. If the case necessarily requires the court to rule on the
rights and obligations of a state that has not consented to the court's
jurisdiction, the court does not proceed to issue a judgment on the merits.

If the court decides it has jurisdiction and the case is admissible, the
respondent then is required to file a Memorial addressing the merits of the
applicant's claim. Once all written arguments are filed, the court holds a
public hearing on the merits.

Once a case has been filed, any party (usually the applicant) may seek an
order from the court to protect the _status quo_ pending the hearing of the
case. Such orders are known as Provisional (or Interim) Measures and are
analogous to interlocutory injunctions in United States law. Article 41 of the
statute allows the court to make such orders. The court must be satisfied to
have _prima facie_ jurisdiction to hear the merits of the case before it
grants provisional measures.

### Applications to intervene

In cases in which a third state's interests are affected, that state may be
permitted to intervene in the case and participate as a full party. Under
Article 62, a state "with an interest of a legal nature" may apply; however,
it is within the court's discretion whether or not to allow the intervention.
Intervention applications are rare, and the first successful application
occurred only in 1991.

### Judgment and remedies

Once deliberation has taken place, the court issues a majority opinion.
Individual judges may issue concurring opinions (if they agree with the
outcome reached in the judgment of the court but differ in their reasoning) or
dissenting opinions (if they disagree with the majority). No appeal is
possible, but any party may ask for the court to clarify if there is a dispute
as to the meaning or scope of the court's judgment.

## Criticisms

The International Court has been criticized with respect to its rulings, its
procedures, and its authority. As with criticisms of the United Nations, many
critics and opponents of the court refer to the general authority assigned to
the body by member states through its Charter, rather than to specific
problems with the composition of judges or their rulings. Major criticisms
include the following:

  * "Compulsory" jurisdiction is limited to cases where both parties have agreed to submit to its decision, and so instances of aggression tend to be automatically escalated to and adjudicated by the Security Council. ICJ rulings are legally binding on states but not enforceable without their approval or compliance.
  * The International Court does not enjoy a full separation of powers, with permanent members of the Security Council being able to veto enforcement of cases, even those to which they consented to be bound. Because the jurisdiction does not have binding force itself, in many cases, the instances of aggression are adjudicated by Security Council by adopting a resolution, etc. There is, therefore, a likelihood for the permanent member states of Security Council to avoid the legal responsibility brought up by International Court of Justice, as shown in the example of _Nicaragua v. United States_.
  * The court has been accused of judicial parsimony, with its rulings tending to dismiss submissions of parties on jurisdictional grounds and not resolving the underlying dispute between them.
  * The court has been accused of exhibiting a political bias, with past research finding "strong evidence" that judges at the ICJ "favour the state that appoints them", "favour states whose wealth level is close to that of the judges' own state", and "favour states whose political system is similar to that of the judges' own state."
