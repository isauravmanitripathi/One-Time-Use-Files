International organization

The **European Atomic Energy Community** (**EAEC** or **EURATOM**) is an
international organization established by the Euratom Treaty of 1957 with the
original purpose of creating a specialist market for nuclear power in Europe,
by developing nuclear energy and distributing it to its member states while
selling the surplus to non-member states. Having become one of the three
European Communities alongside the European Coal and Steel Community and the
European Economic Community following the merger of their executive bodies in
1967, the Euratom is _de facto_ under the authority of the European Union (EU)
but remains _de jure_ a separate organization.

It is legally distinct from the European Union although it has the same
membership, and is governed by many of the EU's institutions; but it is the
only remaining community organization that is independent of the EU and
therefore outside the regulatory control of the European Parliament. Over the
years its scope has been increased to cover a variety of areas associated with
nuclear power and ionising radiation as diverse as safeguarding of nuclear
materials, radiation protection, coordinating EU members' nuclear research
programmes for peaceful purposes, and construction of the International Fusion
Reactor.

Since 2014, Switzerland has also participated in Euratom programmes as an
associated state. The United Kingdom ceased to be a full member of the
organization on 31 January 2020. However, under the terms of the EU–UK Trade
and Cooperation Agreement, the United Kingdom participates in Euratom as an
associated state following the end of the transition period on 31 December
2020.

## History

signing the European customs union and Euratom Treaty in Rome, Italy
(Bundesarchiv, 1 April 1957)

The driving force behind the creation of the European Atomic Energy Community
(EURATOM) was France's desire to develop nuclear power and nuclear weapons
without having to rely on the United States and/or the United Kingdom. The
costs of nuclear development were also large, motivating France to share the
costs with the other member states of the European Coal and Steel Community
(ECSC). During the negotiations to create Euratom, the United States and the
United Kingdom sought to gain influence over nuclear development in Europe.
Hence, the US and the UK created the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) as
a way to limit the value of Euratom and gain influence over the spread of
nuclear technology. The Soviet Union launched a propaganda campaign against
Euratom, as it sought to stoke fears among Europeans that the organization
would enable West Germany to develop nuclear weapons for its own military
purposes.

The Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the
Château of Val-Duchesse in 1956 drew up the essentials of the new treaties.
Euratom would foster cooperation in the nuclear field, at the time a very
popular area, and would, along with the EEC, share the Common Assembly and
Court of Justice of the ECSC, but not its executives. Euratom would have its
own Council and Commission, with fewer powers than the High Authority of the
European Coal and Steel Community. On 25 March 1957, the Treaties of Rome (the
Euratom Treaty and the EEC Treaty) were signed by the six ECSC members and on
1 January 1958 they came into force.

The Common Assembly proposed extending the powers of the ECSC to cover other
sources of energy. However, Jean Monnet, ECSC architect and President, wanted
a separate community to cover nuclear power. The President of the European
Commission, Louis Armand, was put in charge of a study into the prospects of
nuclear energy use in Europe; his report concluded that further nuclear
development was needed to fill the deficit left by the exhaustion of coal
deposits and to reduce dependence on oil producers. However, the Benelux
countries and West Germany were also keen on creating a general single market,
although it was opposed by France due to its protectionism, and Jean Monnet
thought it too large and difficult a task. In 1957, Monnet proposed the
creation of separate atomic energy and economic communities to reconcile both
groups. To save on resources, these separate executives created by the Rome
Treaties were unified by the Merger Treaty in 1967. The institutions of the
EEC would take over responsibilities for the running of the ECSC and Euratom,
with all three then becoming known as the European Communities even if each
legally existed separately. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty set the foundation
of the European Union (EU), which absorbed the Communities into the European
Community pillar, while Euratom still maintained a distinct legal personality.

The European Constitution was intended to consolidate all previous treaties
and increase democratic accountability in them. The Euratom Treaty had not
been amended as the other treaties had, so the European Parliament had been
granted few powers over it. However, the reason it had gone unamended was the
same reason the Constitution left it to remain separate from the rest of the
EU: a strong anti-nuclear sentiment among the European electorate, which may
unnecessarily turn voters against the treaty. The Euratom treaty thus remains
in force relatively unamended from its original signing.

## EU evolution timeline

Since the end of World War II, sovereign European countries have entered into
treaties and thereby co-operated and harmonised policies (or _pooled
sovereignty_) in an increasing number of areas, in the European integration
project or the _construction of Europe_ (French: _la construction
européenne_). The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the
European Union (EU)—the principal framework for this unification. The EU
inherited many of its present responsibilities from the European Communities
(EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman
Declaration.

  1. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ _**c**_ _**d**_ _**e**_ Although not EU treaties _per se_ , these treaties affected the development of the EU defence arm, a main part of the CFSP. The Franco-British alliance established by the Dunkirk Treaty was _de facto_ superseded by WU. The CFSP pillar was bolstered by some of the security structures that had been established within the remit of the 1955 Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT). The Brussels Treaty was terminated in 2011, consequently dissolving the WEU, as the mutual defence clause that the Lisbon Treaty provided for EU was considered to render the WEU superfluous. The EU thus _de facto_ superseded the WEU.
  2. **^** Plans to establish a European Political Community (EPC) were shelved following the French failure to ratify the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC). The EPC would have combined the ECSC and the EDC.
  3. **^** The European Communities obtained common institutions and a shared legal personality (i.e. ability to e.g. sign treaties in their own right).
  4. **^** The treaties of Maastricht and Rome form the EU's legal basis, and are also referred to as the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), respectively. They are amended by secondary treaties.
  5. **^** Between the EU's founding in 1993 and consolidation in 2009, the union consisted of three pillars, the first of which were the European Communities. The other two pillars consisted of additional areas of cooperation that had been added to the EU's remit.
  6. **^** The consolidation meant that the EU inherited the European Communities' legal personality and that the pillar system was abolished, resulting in the EU framework as such covering all policy areas. Executive/legislative power in each area was instead determined by a distribution of competencies between EU institutions and member states. This distribution, as well as treaty provisions for policy areas in which unanimity is required and qualified majority voting is possible, reflects the depth of EU integration as well as the EU's partly supranational and partly intergovernmental nature.

## Withdrawal of the United Kingdom

The United Kingdom announced its intention to withdraw from the EAEC on 26
January 2017, following on from its decision to withdraw from the European
Union. Formal notice to withdraw from the EAEC was provided in March 2017,
within the Article 50 notification letter, where the withdrawal was made
explicit. Withdrawal only became effective following negotiations on the terms
of the exit, which lasted two years and ten months.

A report by the House of Commons' Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy
Committee, published in May 2017, questioned the legal necessity of leaving
Euratom, and called for a temporary extension of the United Kingdom's
membership of Euratom in order to allow time for new arrangements to be made
instead. In June 2017, the European Commission's negotiations task force
published a _Position paper transmitted to EU27 on nuclear materials and
safeguard equipment (Euratom)_ , titled "Essential Principles on nuclear
materials and safeguard equipment". The following month, a briefing paper from
the House of Commons Library assessed the implications of leaving Euratom.

In July 2017, an article published by the _The Independent_ questioned the
availability of nuclear power to the United Kingdom after 2019 if the country
were to withdraw from the Euratom Treaty, and the need for new treaties
relating to the transportation of nuclear materials. During the same month, an
article published by the _New Scientist_ stated that radioisotope supply for
cancer treatments would also need to be considered in new treaties.

British politicians speculated that the United Kingdom could retain its
membership in the EAEC. In 2017, some argued that this would require—beyond
the consent of the EU27—amendment or revocation of the Article 50 letter of
March 2017. The _Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018_ , making provision for
safeguards after withdrawal from Euratom, received royal assent on 26 June
2018.

The EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, outlining the United Kingdom's
relationship with the European Union from 1 January 2021 onwards, makes
provision for the country's participation "as an associated country of all
parts of the Euratom programme".

## Achievements

In the history of European regulation, Article 37 of the Euratom Treaty
represents a pioneering legislation concerning binding transfrontier
obligations with respect to environmental impact and protection of human
lives, especially regarding the dismantling of nuclear reactors.
