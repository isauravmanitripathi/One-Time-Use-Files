Latin American trade agreement

The **Pacific Alliance** (Spanish: _Alianza del Pacífico_) is a Latin American
trade bloc, formed by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru, which all border the
Pacific Ocean. The alliance was formed with the express purpose of improving
regional integration and moving toward complete freedom in the movement of
goods, services, capital and people between the four member states. Together,
these four countries have a combined population of more than 230 million
people and make up roughly 35 percent of Latin American GDP.

The following countries are full members, in the process of becoming full
members or observers. On 28 April 2011, then president of Peru Alan García
organized a meeting with the presidents of Chile, Colombia and Mexico at the
time. This working group issued the _Declaración de Lima_ , a statement of
intent to establish the Pacific Alliance. The initial goal of the alliance was
to further free trade with "a clear orientation toward Asia" and regional
economic integration.

Together, the four member states of the Pacific Alliance represent nearly 35
percent of Latin American GDP. If it were counted as a single country, the
Pacific Alliance would have a nominal GDP of US$2.02 trillion (US$4.32
trillion at PPP GDP rates), making it the 9th (or 7th) largest economy in the
world. According to the World Trade Organization, the countries of the Pacific
Alliance together exported roughly US$680 billion in 2019, almost twice as
much as Mercosur, the other predominant Latin American trade bloc.
Individually and collectively, the core countries of the Pacific Alliance have
been deemed "The Pacific Pumas" by political scientists, for their model of
economic and political development.[_citation needed_]

At the VII Pacific Alliance Summit in Cali, Colombia, on 22 May 2013, Costa
Rica signed a trade agreement with Colombia, and later in the summit received
approval for full membership from all the founding members. Costa Rica is
finishing up the process so it can be readily incorporated as the Alliance's
fifth member. At the same summit seven observers were admitted: the Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Honduras, Paraguay, Portugal, among
others.

## Projects

In addition to reducing trade barriers, the Pacific Alliance has begun several
other projects for regional integration, including visa-free tourist travel, a
common stock exchange, and joint embassies in several countries.

### Trade liberalization

In May 2016, the Pacific Alliance removed 92 percent of tariffs on goods
traded between members. Based on a 2013 agreement, the rest of the tariffs
will be removed by 2020.

On 26 January 2022, the Pacific Alliance signed its first collective free
trade agreement with a nation outside the alliance: Singapore. Singapore had
been a candidate for associate member status of the Pacific Alliance since
2017. As of February 2023, ratification of the PASFTA is ongoing.

### Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano

The Mercado Integrado Latinoamericano (MILA) originally integrated the stock
markets of Colombia (Colombia Stock Exchange), Chile (Santiago Stock
Exchange), and Peru (Lima Stock Exchange), and is seen as a foundation for the
Alliance's economic integration. These three stock markets began their
integration in November 2010; this made it Latin America's largest market
according to number of issuers, the second by market capitalization, and the
third by turnover.

The Mexican Stock Exchange began the process of incorporation into MILA and
its full incorporation was expected by the year 2014. The Mexican Stock
Exchange took the step of acquiring a total of 3.79 million shares of the Lima
Stock Exchange (BVL), equivalent to 6.7 percent of the shares of Series A of
that market. This is part of an agreement for a strategic partnership in order
to develop joint business activities and development of the stock markets of
Peru and Mexico, and eventually complete integration into MILA.

The Mexican Stock Exchange met the timeframe and announced the first trade
made as part of MILA on 2 December 2014. The trade on MIILA was a $1,415
purchase of 200 shares in Chilean retailer Falabella, executed by GBM Mexico
through GBM Chile. With the entry of Mexico into MILA, the integrated stock
market now counts 780 issuers among the four countries, making it the biggest
market by number of listed companies in Latin America, and the biggest in
terms of market capitalization, according to the World Federation of
Exchanges. The joint capitalization of the four bourses tops US$1.25 trillion,
making it larger than the US$1.22 trillion BM&F Bovespa.

### Joint diplomatic missions

Among the more important agreements that have been reached is the creation of
joint diplomatic missions (embassies, consulates, etc.) that will provide
citizens of Pacific Alliance member states with needed diplomatic services.
The Declaration of Cali highlights the importance of the opening of an embassy
shared between Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru in Ghana, as well as the
agreement between Chile and Colombia to share embassies in Algeria and Morocco
and between Colombia and Peru to share an embassy in Vietnam. The Declaration
of Cali encourages these countries to move forward on these initiatives. In
November 2014, Mexico opened its first trade office in Africa; located in
Casablanca and shared with the other Pacific Alliance members.

## Expansion

VI Summit of the Pacific Alliance, Santiago de Chile.

As of July 2018, there are 55 observer states of which two are candidate
countries, in process of full membership, which are the Central-American
countries of Costa Rica and Panama.

Canada has also been mentioned as a candidate to join the alliance, and called
a "natural fit" by Mexico's vice-minister of foreign affairs, Sergio Alcocer.
It has free-trade agreements with the four founding members, and has been
encouraged by regional leaders to join the alliance. However the Canadian
government has yet to upgrade its _observer_ status to _observer-candidate_ as
it is still determining whether or not to become a member.

Costa Rica began the process of joining on 10 February 2014 at the eighth
summit of the Alliance in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, when President Laura
Chinchilla signed a protocol at a plenary session finalizing the decision to
join the alliance. The country had since postponed its incorporation into the
alliance indefinitely, pending consultations by its presidential economic
council. However, on 8 July 2022, President Rodrigo Chaves Robles announced
that Costa Rica had applied to become a full member of the Alliance.

Ecuador has been critical of the alliance in conjunction with other leaders of
ALBA, but its president, Rafael Correa, has also speculated on a possible
future bid if integration advances in areas other than trade.

Guatemala has expressed concrete interest in joining the Pacific Alliance and
is pursuing trade deals with current members as a precursor to a possible
membership application.

Panama has expressed interest in joining the Alliance, and is an official
observer-candidate according to the website. Panama has already signed trade
deals with Colombia, Peru and Chile, and reached an agreement with Mexico to
sign a free-trade deal in March 2014. While fulfilling most of the criteria to
enter in the alliance, the country has so far refused to commit itself to full
membership.

Paraguay, a founding member of Mercosur and observer of the Pacific Alliance,
has begun pursuing free-trade deals with current members as a precursor to a
possible membership application. Paraguay was suspended from Mercosur
following the impeachment of Fernando Lugo, although Paraguay asked Mercosur
to lift the sanction. After the election and inauguration of Horacio Cartes,
Paraguay has so far claimed "Paraguay would not abandon Mercosur", but assured
it will seek to join the alliance. The government has said it is reportedly
considering joining the Pacific Alliance in addition to rejoining Mercosur.

U.S. Vice President Joe Biden expressed that the United States was willing to
join the Pacific Alliance as an observer on 23 May 2013, in Bogotá, Colombia,
during a bilateral meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.

Argentine President Mauricio Macri, during his campaign and in press
conferences after the election, has expressed his desire to bring his country
closer to the Pacific Alliance and also work on integration between the bloc
and his country's trade bloc Mercosur.

Uruguay has been encouraged to join the alliance by existing members Peru and
Colombia, and is reportedly considering the possibility of accession.

Honduras officially applied for formal membership in October 2016, with the
vocal support of Chile.

However, due to the Peruvian political crisis caused by the 2022 Peruvian self-coup attempt along with its subsequent protests, the summit was suspended until 2023.
