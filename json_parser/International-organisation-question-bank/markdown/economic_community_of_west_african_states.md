Formation of international cooperation among African States

The **Economic Community of West African States** (**ECOWAS** ; also known as
**CEDEAO** in French and Portuguese) is a regional political and economic
union of twelve countries of West Africa. Collectively, the present and former
members comprise an area of 5,114,162 km2 (1,974,589 sq mi) and have an
estimated population of over 424.34 million.

Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African
Economic Community (AEC), the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve "collective
self-sufficiency" for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc
by building a full economic and trading union. Additionally, ECOWAS aims to
raise living standards and promote economic development. The union was
established on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of Lagos, with its
stated mission to promote economic integration across the region. A revised
version of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993 in Cotonou, the
largest city in Benin.

ECOWAS's published principles include equality and inter-dependence of member
states, solidarity, self-reliance, cooperation and harmonization of policies,
nonaggression, promotion of human rights, economic and social justice, and
democratic governance.

Notably among ECOWAS's protocols and plans are the ECOWAS Free Movement of
Persons, Residences and Establishment Protocol and the Ecotour Action Plan
2019–2029. The _Free Movement of Persons Protocol_ permits citizens the right
to enter and reside in any member state's territory, and the _Ecotour Action
Plan_ aims to develop and integrate the tourist industry of each member state.

ECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, with member states
occasionally sending joint military forces to intervene in the bloc's member
countries at times of political instability and unrest.

In 2024, the military governments of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali jointly
announced their withdrawal from the bloc, after having been suspended
following respective military takeovers in these countries. The withdrawal
took effect on 29 January 2025. The three later went on to form the Alliance
of Sahel States, with the end goal of establishing a federation.

## Member states

ECOWAS currently has 12 member states: five French-speaking, five English-
speaking, and two Portuguese-speaking. All current members joined the
community as founding members in May 1975, except Cape Verde which joined in
1977.

Morocco officially requested to join ECOWAS in February 2017. The application
was endorsed in principle at the Summit of Heads of State in June 2017.
However, Morocco's bid for membership was stalled as West African economic
actors feared goods imported through Morocco's free trade agreements would
flood the market of states within ECOWAS.

### States that have withdrawn or been suspended

Arabic-speaking Mauritania was one of the founding members of ECOWAS in 1975
and decided to withdraw in December 2000. Mauritania signed a new associate-
membership agreement in August 2017.

Mali was suspended from ECOWAS on 30 May 2021, following its second military
coup within nine months. Guinea was also suspended on 8 September 2021,
shortly after a military coup took place in the country. Sanctions were placed
on both countries on 16 September. On 10 January 2022, Mali announced its
decision to close its borders and recalled several ambassadors with ECOWAS in
response to sanctions imposed for deferring elections for four years. On 28
January 2022, Burkina Faso was suspended from ECOWAS following a military
coup. Niger was suspended from ECOWAS after the 2023 coup d'état and
threatened with military intervention if President Mohamed Bazoum was not
restored to office, causing the Nigerien crisis. Additionally, ECOWAS closed
all land and air borders between other member states and Niger and instituted
a no-fly zone on all commercial flights to and from Niger. The suspension
removed all commercial and financial transactions and froze Niger's assets in
ECOWAS central banks. On 16 September 2023, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso
formed a military alliance, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), following
ECOWAS's threat to intervene to restore civilian rule in Niger. On 21 November
2023, Niger's military government asked the ECOWAS regional court to order the
lifting of sanctions imposed on the country. Until the coup, aid from
countries like the United States and international organizations like ECOWAS
accounted for almost half of Niger's annual budget. Following Niger's ECOWAS
suspension, Niger's neighbours closed their borders to the country and 70
percent of its electricity, coming from Nigeria, was cut off. While these
sanctions and consequences that have followed have affected the individuals
and economy of Niger, the government is not backing down. As a result of the
suspension, children have not been able to attend school due to lack of
supplies, and businesses are shutting down due to rising costs. Further, the
ECOWAS lawyer pointed out that the Nigerien government is not recognized by
ECOWAS and therefore does not have the power to ask the regional court for a
removal of these sanctions.

On 28 January 2024, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso announced via a joint
statement that they were withdrawing from ECOWAS "without delay". The three
nations, all of which are currently ruled by military juntas, accused ECOWAS
of implementing "inhumane" sanctions in order to reverse the coups in each
nation. Under the ECOWAS protocol, immediate withdrawal is not possible, and
the three member states could remain in the bloc for up to a year. ECOWAS said
in a statement that "Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali remain important members of
the Community and the Authority remains committed to finding a negotiated
solution to the political impasse."

On 24 February 2024, ECOWAS announced that it was lifting some sanctions
against Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. For Niger this included the border
closures, the freezing of central bank and state assets, the suspension of
commercial transactions, and the no-fly-zone for commercial flights to and
from Niger. However, the political sanctions and targeted sanctions would
remain in force. The communiqué said this was done for humanitarian reasons,
but it was seen as a gesture of appeasement to dissuade the three junta-led
states from withdrawing from the bloc. ECOWAS also lifted sanctions on Guinea
and Guinea-Bissau.

In December 2024, ECOWAS heads of state of the member countries met to
finalize the decision regarding the withdrawal of Mali, Niger and Burkina
Faso, united under the AES. President of Senegal, Basirou Diomaye Faye, stated
on 8 December 2024 that he was continuing to discuss with the three countries
remaining in ECOWAS, while maintaining the Alliance of Sahel States, which he
recognized as a security response in the Sahel region. On 12 December 2024,
ECOWAS President Bola Tinubu confirmed the political will of ECOWAS leaders to
reintegrate the three countries from the Alliance of Sahel States. On 15
December 2024, the Conference of Heads of State of ECOWAS adopted an exit
transition period for Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, which begins on 29 January
2025 and ends on 29 July 2025. During this transition period, ECOWAS has
indicated that any exit would be reversible. The AES rejected the
proposal.[_citation needed_] Celebrations were held in the three countries to
mark the formal exit on 29 January. ECOWAS noted the withdrawal, while calling
for the continuance of existing arrangements for the free movement of people
and goods, including requesting its own members still accept documents from
the departing countries.

The Foreign Ministers of the Alliance of Sahel States met on 26 January 2025,
in Ouagadougou "in anticipation of future talks with ECOWAS", The Ministers
reached a consensus on the overall approach to future negotiations with
ECOWAS, in the best interest of the Sahelian populations. From 29 January
2025, begins the beginning of a six-month "transition period" after the
official separation with the three Sahelian countries. The three Sahelian
countries rejected any possibility of reversing their decision.

In June 2025, the heads of state of ECOWAS will meet to finalize the
formalities for the countries' exit from the alliance of Sahel states.

## History

ECOWAS was formed initially from the region's former French, British and
Portuguese colonies, and independent Liberia, following post-colonial
independence throughout the region (particularly in the 1960s and 1970s). At
independence, many African states were challenged in increasing economic
development. Because these states could not address problems individually,
there was a need for a regional approach and thus ECOWAS was founded. ECOWAS
was formed to provide regional economic cooperation, but has since evolved to
include political and military cooperation, as well.

The union was established on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of
Lagos, with its stated mission to promote economic integration across the
region. A revised version of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993
in Cotonou. Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide
African Economic Community (AEC), the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve
"collective self-sufficiency" for its member states by creating a single large
trade bloc by building a full economic and trading union.

ECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, with member states
occasionally sending joint military forces to intervene in the bloc's member
countries at times of political instability and unrest. ECOWAS facilitates
peacekeeping through systematic collaboration with civil society, cooperation
with development policies, and other activities with the goal to meet sub-
regional security challenges. It has played an important role in monitoring
transitional election in West Africa, and these mediation efforts have even
been recognized within and outside the continent of Africa. In recent years
these included interventions in Ivory Coast in 2003, Liberia in 2003, Guinea-
Bissau in 2012, Mali in 2013, The Gambia in 2017, and Guinea-Bissau in 2022.
Since its creation, ECOWAS has sent peacekeeping forces seven times.

In 2011, ECOWAS adopted its development blueprint for the next decade, _Vision
2020_ , and, to accompany it, a Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST).
However, it has had trouble achieving the goals outlined in the policy.

Covering a region known as a "coup belt", ECOWAS, since the 1990s, has
attempted to defend the region's shift towards democracy against authoritarian
attacks. According to the BBC, since 1990, 78% of the 27 coups in sub-Saharan
Africa have taken place in former French colonies. This has led some to
question whether French influence in Africa has a destabilising effect. The
transition governments in Mali and Burkina Faso cancelled military agreements
that allow for French troops to operate on their territory, and in the case of
Mali, removed French as an official language. However, the group has been
cited for mild and ineffective responses in the early 2020s, when three member
countries experienced military coups d'état – two in Mali, one in Guinea, and
two in Burkina Faso. When a fourth member, Niger, experienced a coup d'état in
July 2023, ECOWAS was vocal in its condemnation and raised the possibility of
military action if the deposed president was not reinstated by 7 August 2023.
Due to the Nigerien military's refusal to restore civilian rule, ECOWAS
activated its standby force composed of all other members except for Mali,
Burkina Faso, Guinea and Cape Verde.

On 6 July 2024, the military leaders of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso signed a
new pact to form a confederation, a political union of sovereign states. The
confederation's stated goal is to provide mutual defense, pool resources to
build energy and communications infrastructure, establish a common market,
implement a monetary union under proposed currency _the Sahel_ , allow free
movement of persons, enable industrialization, and invest in agriculture,
mines and energy sectors, with the end goal of federalizing into a single
sovereign state. The move is seen as a strong move away from ECOWAS, which has
been pressing for a return to civilian rule.

## Structure

### Overall

ECOWAS consists of two operating institutions to implement policies: the
ECOWAS Commission and the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development (EBID) –
formerly known as the Fund for Cooperation, until it was renamed in 2001.

In addition, ECOWAS includes the following institutions: ECOWAS Commission,
Community Court of Justice, Community Parliament, ECOWAS Bank for Investment
and Development (EBID), West African Health Organisation (WAHO), and the
Inter-Governmental Action Group against Money Laundering and Terrorism
Financing in West Africa (GIABA).

ECOWAS includes two sub-regional blocks:

  * The West African Economic and Monetary Union (also known by its French-language acronym UEMOA) is an organisation of eight, mainly French-speaking, states within ECOWAS which share a customs union and currency union. Established in 1994 and intended to counterbalance the dominance of English-speaking economies in the bloc (such as Nigeria and Ghana), members of UEMOA are mostly former territories of French West Africa. The currency they all use is the CFA franc, which is pegged to the euro.
  * The West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), established in 2000, comprises six mainly English-speaking countries within ECOWAS which plan to work towards adopting their own common currency, the eco.

ECOWAS operates in three co-official languages—French, English, and
Portuguese.

### Regional security co-operation

ECOWAS nations signed a non-aggression protocol in 1990 along with two earlier
agreements in 1978 and 1981. They also signed a Protocol on Mutual Defence
Assistance in Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 29 May 1981, that provided for the
establishment of an Allied Armed Force of the Community.

### Community Parliament

The Community Parliament consists of 115 members, distributed based on the
population of each member state. This body is headed by the Speaker of the
Parliament, who is above the Secretary General.

Country  | Parliament Seats   
---|---  
Benin | 5   
Burkina Faso | 6   
Cape Verde | 5   
Gambia | 5   
Ghana | 8

### Expanded ECOWAS Commission

For the third time since its inception in 1975, ECOWAS is undergoing
institutional reforms. The first was when it revised its treaty on 24 July
1993; the second was in 2007 when the Secretariat was transformed into a
Commission. As of July 2013, ECOWAS now has six new departments (Human
Resources Management; Education, Science and Culture; Energy and Mines;
Telecommunications and IT; Industry and Private Sector Promotion). Finance and
Administration to Sierra Leone has been decoupled, to give the incoming Ghana
Commissioner the new portfolio of Administration and Conferences.

### Community Court of Justice

ECOWAS Community Court of Justice was created by a protocol signed in 1991 and
was later included in Article 6 of the Revised Treaty of the Community in
1993. However, the Court did not officially begin operations until the 1991
protocol came into effect on 5 November 1996. The jurisdiction of the court is
outlined in Article 9 and Articles 76 of the Revised Treaty and allows rulings
on disputes between states over interpretations of the Revised Treaty. It also
provides ECOWAS Council with advisory opinions on legal issues (Article 10).
Like its companion courts, the European Court of Human Rights and East African
Court of Justice, it has jurisdiction to rule on fundamental human rights
breaches.

### Sporting and cultural exchange

ECOWAS nations organise a broad array of cultural and sports events under the
auspices of the body, including the CEDEAO Cup in football, the 2012 ECOWAS
Games and the Miss CEDEAO beauty pageant.

The Community Heads of State and Government adopted African Traditional
Wrestling as the Community sport, and through its specialised agency in charge
of youth and sports development, the Ouagadougou-based ECOWAS Youth and Sports
Development Centre (EYSDC), has consistently organised the yearly ECOWAS
African Wrestling Tournament mainly in Dakar (Senegal) and Niamey (Niger)
based on a harmonized African wrestling code.

The Community, through the EYSDC, also organized 2 editions of ECOWAS
International Cycling tour, taking close to 100 riders from all member states,
from Lagos to Accra and then from Lagos to Abidjan. In addition to the sports
and well-being objective of the tour, the race also served to demonstrate and
put into practice ECOWAS protocol on free movement of goods and persons.

In 2019, the EYSDC instituted ECOWAS Abuja International Marathon. The first
edition brought together international marathoners from West Africa, Kenya,
Ethiopia and Cameroon.

Similarly, the Community, through its specialised agency, promotes regional
sports development by offering sponsorship to regional sports federations and
specialized disciplines such as the West African Deaf Sports Union (WADSU),
the West African Liaison Office of the International Council for Military
Sports (WALO-CISM), the Region 2 of the African Athletics Federation, and the
West African University Games (WAUG), among others.

### Youth

The ECOWAS Youth Policy Strategic Plan of Action (SPAO) is a 10-year plan that
aims to promote youth development and empowerment in the Economic Community of
West African States (ECOWAS). The SPAO was adopted in 2016 and is based on the
pillars of education and training, employment and entrepreneurship, health and
well-being, peace and security, and governance and participation.

The SPAO identifies a number of challenges facing youth in ECOWAS, including
high unemployment rates, lack of access to education and training, and poor
health outcomes. The plan sets out a number of strategies to address these
challenges, including investing in education and training, creating jobs and
supporting entrepreneurship, improving access to health care, promoting peace
and security, and strengthening youth participation in governance.

## Economic integration

### West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA)

Formed in 1994 on the basis of earlier arrangements whose roots lie in the
colonial era of French West Africa, the West African Economic and Monetary
Union, often referred to by its French acronym UEMOA, brings together eight
West African states of which seven were French colonies until the late 1950s.
The member countries use the West African CFA franc as their currency and
share common institutions including the Central Bank of West African States,
Banking Commission of the West African Monetary Union, Financial Markets
Authority of the West African Monetary Union, and (together with other African
countries of the Franc Zone) Regional Insurance Control Commission.

  * Ivory Coast (founding member)
  * Mali (founding member)
  * Niger (founding member)
  * Senegal (founding member)
  * Togo (founding member)

### West African Monetary Zone

Formed in 2000, the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) is a group of six
countries within ECOWAS that plan to introduce a common currency called the
eco. The six member states of WAMZ are Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria and
Sierra Leone who founded the organisation together in 2000 and Liberia who
joined on 16 February 2010. Apart from Guinea, which is francophone, they are
all English-speaking countries. Along with Mauritania, Guinea opted out of the
CFA franc currency shared by all other former French colonies in West and
Central Africa.

The WAMZ attempts to establish a strong stable currency to rival the CFA
franc, whose exchange rate is tied to that of the euro and is guaranteed by
the French Treasury. The eventual goal is for the CFA franc and eco to merge,
giving all of West and Central Africa a single, stable currency. The launch of
the new currency is being developed by the West African Monetary Institute
based in Accra, Ghana.

With the exit of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso from the body, two structural
options for a single currency could emerge: the "Sahel" for the AES and the
"Eco" for the ECOWAS member countries.

### The Free Movement of Persons, Residence and Establishment Protocol

In May 1979, ECOWAS adopted a Free Movement of Persons, Residence and
Establishment Protocol, which permits citizens to enter, reside, and establish
economic activities in the territory of member states. There were three phases
of implementation to achieve the goals of the protocol. Over the course of
five years, Phase I eliminated the need for visas for stays of up to 90 days
within the ECOWAS territory. Phase II attempted to extend residency to
citizens in host ECOWAS states to seek income-earning employment after
obtaining an ECOWAS residence card. Phase II also required member states to
grant migrant workers equal treatment in areas such as employment,
participation, social and cultural activities, and in certain cases of job
loss, re-employment, and training. Phase III centered on the facilitation and
establishment of business through the right of citizens to manage economic
activities in countries other than their country of origin. However, this
right has not been fully established in the ECOWAS region. While these three
phases promoting freedom of movement within the ECOWAS region is more advanced
than in any other regional grouping in Africa, only the first phase has been
fully implemented by all ECOWAS countries. The complete implementation of the
90-day visa-free window enhanced human mobility in the region, creating
positive effects on trade and economic development.

In December 2000, the ECOWAS passport was introduced as a common passport that
functions as an international travel document, and member states are currently
in the process of implementing a joint visa for non-ECOWAS citizens.
Additionally, ECOWAS has worked to ease the movement of people transported in
private and commercial vehicles by implementing policies that enable vehicles
to enter and reside in a State for up to ninety days. Most ECOWAS states have
instituted an ECOWAS brown card, which provides prompt, fair, and immediate
compensation for any motor accident which occurs outside a motorist's home-
country.

While monitoring committees exist to ensure all three phases of the protocol
are successfully implemented, their work is vague and has not been credited
with effective and efficient production of data. The largest challenges
assosicated within the implementation of the protocol occur due to lack of
commitment and enforceability. More so, there is a lack of access to readily
available migrant information in the ECOWAS region. This poses a barrier to
freedom of movement as immigration officials in member states are unaware that
individuals who hold valid travel documents can enter their country freely.
Therefore, West African migrants, who are entitled to enter through regular
channels, leave their countries without proper travel documents and enter
other countries illegally. This illegal and irregular entry poses a barrier
towards gaining reliable travel statistics.

For example, Francophone countries in the region have issued national identity
cards that can be used similarly to a passport. These cards permit citizens to
cross borders after presenting their identity cards. However, Anglophone
countries have only just begun distributing a similar form of identification.
Consequently, immigration officials in Anglophone countries commonly reject
Francophone national identity cards and do not permit Francophone citizens to
cross into their borders. Further, these structural barriers are exasperated
between different social classes. Middle-class individuals typically
experience a smoother border-crossing process than working-class individuals
and impoverished citizens who do not have travel documents and are not fluent
in the language of the countries they are crossing into.

## Transport

A Trans-ECOWAS project, established in 2007, plans to upgrade railways in this
zone.

## Tourism

In 2019, ECOWAS unveiled its Ecotour Action Plan 2019 – 2029. It focuses on
tourism heritage protection and development and on the development of
standards, regulations, and control systems. The plan includes five programs
for implementation, and detailed mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation.
Ecotourism is not specifically developed, yet it has been mentioned that the
program has the opportunity to create linkages between institutions and
stakeholder collaboration to suit ecotourism projects that prioritize
community, biodiversity, and socioeconomics. The Ecotour Plan prioritizes
local development, especially in generating skilled and unskilled jobs for
marginalized individuals, and aims to make the ECOWAS region a first-class
tourist destination in Africa. During its creation, ECOWAS ministers also
called on ecotourism programs to protect threatened biodiversity in the
Guinean Forests, which span into seven ECOWAS member states. Similar to the
Free Movement of People Protocol, Ecotour aims to integrate aviation and
ground transportation. ECOWAS hopes that this regional approach will allow
states to fight against pandemics such as COVID-19 to restore tourism and
ecosystems. Ecotour works to create increasing returns to its members'
economies by lowering transport costs, developing hospitality training centers
and creating a more integrated use of digital technology.

As of March 2023, Council members mentioned that phases one and two of the
Ecotour Action Plan have come to an end and that the community is moving into
phase three and four, which focuses on the development of tourist
accommodations establishments, and a proposal for a regional mechanism to
enforce tourist regulations. By the end of phase five, ECOWAS hopes to have
unified accommodations in hotels, ecolodges, motels, apart hotels, and
hostels. In April 2023, tourism experts met to amend the new text for tourist
accommodations in the ECOWAS region. This phase is critical to the success of
the Ecotour plan as the lack of a regulatory system has been a barrier to the
development of the tourism sector, despite its ability to increase member
states' economies. During this conference, ministers improved the tourism
industry by adopting standards for hotel services. Mrs. Massandjé Toure-Liste,
the ECOWAS Commission's Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture,
pointed out the improvements in the tourist sector due to the African
Continental Free Trade Area, a trade agreement signed by 44 members of the
African Union which creates a single market for goods and services. Mrs.
Toure-Liste praised the trade area for providing development opportunities,
economic growth, and boosting regional integration.

## Repatriation of cultural artefacts

ECOWAS has emerged as a key regional actor in the movement to repatriate
cultural property removed during colonial and post-colonial conflicts. In
2019, its Ministers of Culture adopted a Regional Action Plan for the return
of African cultural artefacts to their countries of origin, marking a formal
commitment to correct historical injustices and to safeguard regional
heritage.

West Africa’s museums, palaces and sacred sites suffered extensive plunder
under European colonial regimes. Artefacts ranging from royal regalia to
ritual objects were extracted and dispersed across Europe and North America.
This loss of cultural patrimony weakened local identities and deprived future
generations of tangible links to their past. By the late twentieth century,
ECOWAS member states recognised that repatriating such objects was essential
to restoring cultural continuity and promoting tourism and education in the
region.

Individual member states initiated bilateral requests for return of artefacts
as early as the 1960s, but these efforts often lacked coordination and
leverage. In December 2018, ECOWAS Heads of State adopted a Political
Declaration in Abuja instructing the Commission to develop a regional
mechanism for repatriation, reflecting a consensus that joint action would
carry greater weight in negotiations with former colonial powers. Critics
warned that without legal force, the plan risked being a symbolic gesture.

On 17 July 2019 in Cotonou, Benin, ECOWAS Ministers of Culture validated the
2019–2023 Regional Action Plan for the return of cultural artefacts. The Plan
sets out six strategic objectives, including establishing a legal framework,
mobilising financing, strengthening governance and mapping artefact
inventories held abroad. In May 2021, ECOWAS Commissioner Mamadou Traoré led
advocacy talks with Liberian authorities to encourage ratification of the 1970
UNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on cultural property,
underscoring ECOWAS’s role in driving member-state compliance with
international norms.
