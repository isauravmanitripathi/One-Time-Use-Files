**Sustainable Energy for All** (**SEforALL**) is an international organization
working in partnership with the United Nations, leaders in government, the
private sector, financial institutions and civil society with as goal to drive
further, faster action toward the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal
7, which calls for universal access to sustainable energy by 2030, and the
Paris Agreement, which calls for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit
climate warming to below 2 °C.

Launched by former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in 2011, SEforALL is now
an independent organization based in Vienna, Austria with a satellite office
in Washington, DC.
