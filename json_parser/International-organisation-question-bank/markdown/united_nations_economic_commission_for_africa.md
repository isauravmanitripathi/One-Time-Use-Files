Specialized body of the United Nations

The **United Nations Economic Commission for Africa** (**UNECA** or **ECA** ;
French: _Commission économique pour l'Afrique_ , CEA) was established in 1958
by the United Nations Economic and Social Council to encourage economic
cooperation among its member states (the nations of the African continent)
following a recommendation of the United Nations General Assembly. It is one
of five regional commissions.

The ECA has 54 member states, corresponding to the 54 member states of the
United Nations that lie within the continent of Africa or in oceans nearby the
continent. The ECA's mandate is to promote the economic and social development
of its member states, foster intra-regional integration, and promote
international cooperation for Africa's development.

On October 6, 2023, the UN Secretary-General appointed Claver Gatete of Rwanda
as the Executive Secretary of UNECA, replacing the Cameroonian Vera Songwe.

## Themes and programs

The commission's work is structured into seven program divisions:

  * African Centre for Statistics
  * Macroeconomic Policy
  * Social development Policy
  * Innovation and Technology
  * Regional integration and Trade
  * Capacity Development

### Implementing Sustainable Development Goals

The ECA seeks to balance the global Sustainable Development Goals with prior
regional agendas that are supported by governments. Notably this is done for
Agenda 2063, which was agreed on by the African Union a few months before the
launch of the SDGs in 2015. To better integrate the two agendas in country
plans and activities, UNECA has developed an online tool indicating synergies
and trade-offs and an integrated planning and reporting toolkit. In terms of
gaps, three of twenty Agenda 2063 goals do not align with any SDG (notably the
goals on the establishment of continental financial and monetary institutions
and on regional peace and stability, although perhaps these can be caught in a
broad definition of SDG 17).

The Regional Fora for Sustainable Development work as a coordination mechanism
and resemble a “mini-High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development
(HLPF)” in the region. The _Seventh African Forum on Sustainable Development_
, for example, was followed by efforts to seek more funding for the Congo
Basin by taking the conference outcomes to both the COP26 (the 26th conference
of the parties to the UN climate convention) in Glasgow in 2021 and to the
High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.

### Climate finance

The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in more debts for many countries and sparked a
global discussion on new financial mechanisms. All of the Regional
Commissions—except for the one for Europe, given the prevalence of high-income
countries in its membership—launched new initiatives, many linked to climate
finance. The ECA launched the _Liquidity and Sustainability Facility_ in 2021
to mobilize (private sector) capital, supported by an asset management firm
and a collateral management provider. Its objectives are to support the
liquidity of African sovereign eurobonds and incentivize SDG-related
investments on the continent.
