Multilateral disarmament forum

A meeting of the Conference on Disarmament in the Council Chamber of the
Palace of Nations

The **Conference on Disarmament** (**CD**) is a multilateral disarmament forum
established by the international community to negotiate arms control and
disarmament agreements based at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. The
Conference meets annually in three separate sessions in Geneva.

## History

The Conference was first established in 1979 as the **Committee on
Disarmament** as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the
international community. It was renamed the **Conference on Disarmament** in
1984.

The Conference succeeded three other disarmament-related bodies: the Ten
Nation Committee on Disarmament (1960), the Eighteen Nation Committee on
Disarmament (1962–1968) and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament
(1969–1978).

The Conference was created with a permanent agenda, also known as the
"Decalogue", which includes the following topics:

  * Nuclear weapons in all aspects
  * Other weapons of mass destruction
  * Conventional weapons
  * Reduction of military budgets
  * Reduction of armed forces
  * Disarmament and development
  * Disarmament and international security
  * Collateral measures; confidence building measures; effective verification methods in relation to appropriate disarmament measures, acceptable to all parties
  * Comprehensive programme of disarmament leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control

Additionally, all decisions of the body must be agreed upon by consensus
according to the rules and procedures of the conference.

## Relationship to the United Nations

The Conference is formally independent from the United Nations. However, while
it is not formally a UN organization, it is linked to it in various ways.
First and foremost, the Director-General of the United Nations Office at
Geneva serves as the Secretary-General of the Conference. Furthermore, while
the Conference adopts its own rules of procedure and agenda, the United
Nations General Assembly can pass resolutions recommending specific topics to
the Conference. Finally, the Conference submits a report of its activities to
the General Assembly yearly, or more frequently, as appropriate.

The Conference on Disarmament Secretariat and Conference Support Branch of the
United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, based in Geneva, provides
organizational and substantive servicing to the Conference on Disarmament, the
single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international
community.

## Work of the Conference

Initially, the Conference and its predecessors were successful in meeting
their mandate. They were instrumental in drafting numerous arms control
agreements: most importantly, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons (1968), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons
Convention (1993) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (1996).

However, the work of the body was stalled for over a decade, as members were
unable to agree on a work program after the passage of the Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Difficulties included strained relations between key
players, disagreement among members on the prioritization of issues, and
attempts of some countries to link progress in one area to parallel progress
in other areas.

Then, in 2009 a breakthrough was made by the body when it established several
working groups to tackle various topics under the Conference's authority.
These group focused on: negotiating a treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons (FMCT), creating practical steps to reduce
nuclear weapons, Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) and
addressing negative security assurances.

Due to the general dysfunction of the Conference and its limited membership,
negotiations for the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons took
place at the United Nations, and not at the Conference.
