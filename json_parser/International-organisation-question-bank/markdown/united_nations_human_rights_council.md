The **United Nations Human Rights Council** (**UNHRC**) is a United Nations
body whose mission is to promote and protect human rights around the world.
The Council has 47 members elected for staggered three-year terms on a
regional group basis. The headquarters of the Council are at the United
Nations Office at Geneva in Switzerland.

The Council investigates allegations of breaches of human rights in United
Nations member states and addresses thematic human rights issues like freedom
of association and assembly, freedom of expression, freedom of belief and
religion, women's rights, LGBT rights, and the rights of racial and ethnic
minorities.

The Council was established by the United Nations General Assembly on 15 March
2006 to replace the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR, herein
CHR). The Council works closely with the Office of the High Commissioner for
Human Rights (OHCHR) and engages the United Nations special procedures. The
Council has been strongly criticized for including member countries that
engage in human rights abuses.

## Structure

The members of the General Assembly elect the members who occupy 47 seats of
the Human Rights Council. The term of each seat is three years, and no member
may occupy a seat for more than two consecutive terms. The previous CHR had a
membership of 53 countries elected by the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC)
through a majority of those present and voting.

### Sessions

The UNHRC holds regular sessions three times a year, in March, June, and
September. The UNHRC can decide at any time to hold a special session to
address human rights violations and emergencies, at the request of one-third
of the member states. As of November 2023[update], there had been 36 special
sessions.

### Members

The Council consists of 47 members, elected yearly by the General Assembly for
staggered three-year terms. Members are selected via the basis of equitable
geographic rotation using the United Nations regional grouping system. Members
are eligible for re-election for one additional term, after which they must
relinquish their seat. United Nations member states outside the Council serve
as observer states.

The seats are distributed along the following lines:

  * 13 for the African Group
  * 13 for the Asia-Pacific Group
  * 6 for the Eastern European Group
  * 8 for the Latin American and Caribbean Group
  * 7 for the Western European and Others Group

### Suspensions

The General Assembly can suspend the rights and privileges of any Council
member that it decides has persistently committed gross and systematic
violations of human rights during its term of membership. The suspension
process requires a two-thirds majority vote by the General Assembly. The
resolution establishing the UNHRC states that "when electing members of the
Council, Member States shall take into account the contribution of candidates
to the promotion and protection of human rights and their voluntary pledges
and commitments made thereto", and that "members elected to the Council shall
uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights".

Under those provisions, and in response to a recommendation made by the
Council's members, on 1 March 2011 the General Assembly voted to suspend
Libya's membership in the light of the situation in the country in the wake of
Muammar Gaddafi's "violent crackdown on anti-government protestors"; Libya was
reinstated as a Council member on 18 November 2011.

On 7 April 2022, just days after photographic and video material of the Bucha
massacre emerged, the eleventh emergency special session of the General
Assembly suspended Russia from the council due to the gross and systematic
violations of human rights committed during the 2022 Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Deputy Permanent Representative Gennady Kuzmin said that Russia had
withdrawn from the council earlier in the day in expectation of the vote.
Russia was only the second Human Rights Council member to be suspended from
the UN body, after Libya in 2011, and it was the first permanent member of the
UN Security Council to be suspended from any United Nations body.

### Directly responsible subsidiary bodies

#### Universal Periodic Review Working Group

An important component of the Council consists of a periodic review of all 193
UN member states, called the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). The mechanism is
based on reports coming from different sources, one of them being
contributions from non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Each country's
situation will be examined during a three-and-a-half-hour debate.

The first cycle of the UPR took place between 2008 and 2011, the second cycle
between 2012 and 2016, and the third cycle began in 2017 and is expected to be
completed in 2021.

The General Assembly resolution establishing the Council provided that "the
Council shall review its work and functioning five years after its
establishment". The main work of the review was undertaken in an
Intergovernmental Working Group established by the Council in its Resolution
12/1 of 1 October 2009. The review was finalized in March 2011, by the
adoption of an "Outcome" at the Council's 16th session, annexed to Resolution
16/21.

First cycle: The following terms and procedures were set out in General
Assembly Resolution 60/251:

  * Reviews are to occur over a four-year period (48 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2008 and 2011;
  * The order of review should follow the principles of universality and equal treatment;
  * All Member States of the Council will be reviewed while they sit at the Council and the initial members of the Council will be first;
  * The selection of the countries to be reviewed must respect the principle of equitable geographical allocation;
  * The first Member States and the first observatory States to be examined will be selected randomly in each regional group to guarantee full compliance with the equitable geographical allocation. Reviews shall then be conducted alphabetically.

Second cycle: HRC Resolution 16/21 brought the following changes:

  * Reviews are to occur over a four-and-a-half-year period (42 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2012 and 2016;
  * The order of review will be similar to the 1st cycle;
  * The length of each Review will be extended from three to three-and-a-half hours;
  * The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the recommendations.

Similar mechanisms exist in other organizations: International Atomic Energy
Agency, Council of Europe, International Monetary Fund, Organization of
American States, and the World Trade Organization.

#### Advisory Committee

The Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights was the
main subsidiary body of the CHR. The Sub-Commission was composed of 26 elected
human rights experts whose mandate was to conduct studies on discriminatory
practices and to make recommendations to ensure that racial, national,
religious, and linguistic minorities are protected by law.

In 2006, the newly created UNHRC assumed responsibility for the Sub-
Commission. The Sub-Commission's mandate was extended for one year (to June
2007), but it met for the final time in August 2006. At its final meeting, the
Sub-Commission recommended the creation of a Human Rights Consultative
Committee to provide advice to the UNHRC.

In September 2007, the UNHRC decided to create an Advisory Committee to
provide expert advice with 18 members, distributed as follows: five from
African states; five from Asian states; three from Latin American and
Caribbean states; three from Western European and other states; and two
members from Eastern European states.

#### Complaint procedure

The UNHRC complaint procedure was established on 18 June 2007 (by UNHRC
Resolution 5/1) for reporting of consistent patterns of gross and reliably
attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of
the world and under any circumstances.

The UNHRC set up two working groups for its Complaint Procedure:

  * the _Working Group on Communications_ (WGC) – consists of five experts designated by the Advisory Committee from among its members, one from each regional group. The experts serve for three years with the possibility of one renewal. The experts determine whether a complaint deserves investigation, in which case it is passed to the WGS.
  * the _Working Group on Situations_ (WGS) – has five members, appointed by the regional groups from among its members on the Council for one year, which is renewable once. The WGS meets twice a year for five working days to examine the communications transferred to it by the WGC, including the replies of states thereon, as well as the situations which are already before the UNHRC under the complaint procedure. The WGS, on the basis of the information and recommendations provided by the WGC, presents the UNHRC with a report on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and makes recommendations to the UNHRC on the course of actions to take.

Filing a complaint

The Chairman of the WGC screens complaints for admissibility. A complaint must
be in writing, and cannot be anonymous. Examples provided by the UNHRC of
cases that would be considered consistent patterns of gross human rights
violations include alleged deterioration of human rights of people belonging
to a minority, including forced evictions, racial segregation and substandard
living conditions, and alleged degrading situation of prison conditions for
both detainees and prison workers, resulting in violence and death of inmates.
Individuals, groups, or NGOs can claim to be victims of human rights
violations or that have direct, reliable knowledge of such violations.

Complaints can be regarding any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a
particular treaty. Complaints are confidential and the UNHRC will only
communicate with the complainant, unless it decides that the complaint will be
addressed publicly.

The interaction with the complainant and the UNHRC during the complaints
procedure will be on an as-needed basis. UNHRC Resolution 5/1, paragraph 86,
emphasizes that the procedure is victims-oriented. Paragraph 106 provides that
the complaint procedure shall ensure that complainants are informed of the
proceedings at the key stages. The WGC may request further information from
complainants or a third party.

Following the initial screening a request for information will be sent to the
state concerned, which shall reply within three months of the request being
made. WGS will then report to the UNHRC, which will usually be in the form of
a draft resolution or decision on the situation referred to in the complaint.

The UNHRC will decide on the measures to take in a confidential manner as
needed, but this will occur at least once a year. As a general rule, the
period of time between the transmission of the complaint to the state
concerned and consideration by the UNHRC shall not exceed 24 months. Those
individuals or groups who make a complaint should not publicly state the fact
that they have submitted a complaint.

To be accepted complaints must:

  * be in writing and submitted in one of the six UN official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish);
  * contain a description of the relevant facts (including names of alleged victims, dates, location, and other evidence), with as much detail as possible, and shall not exceed 15 pages;
  * not be manifestly politically motivated;
  * not be exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass media;
  * not be already dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body, or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights;
  * be after domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless it appears that such remedies would be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged;
  * not use a language that is abusive or insulting.

  
The complaint procedure is not designed to provide remedies in individual
cases or to provide compensation to alleged victims.

Effectiveness

Due to the confidential manner of the procedure, it is almost impossible to
find out what complaints have passed through the procedure and also how
effective the procedure is.

There is a principle of non-duplication, which means that the complaint
procedure cannot take up the consideration of a case that is already being
dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body or other United Nations or
similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights.[_citation
needed_]

On the UNHRC website under the complaints procedure section there is a list of
situations referred to the UNHRC under the complaint procedure since 2006.
This was only available to the public as of 2014, however generally does not
give any details regarding the situations that were under consideration other
than the state that was involved.[_citation needed_]

In some cases the information is slightly more revealing, for example a
situation that was listed was the situation of trade unions and human rights
defenders in Iraq that was considered in 2012, but the UNHRC decided to
discontinue that consideration.

The complaints procedure has been said to be too lenient due to its
confidential manner. Some have often questioned the value of the procedure,
but 94% of states respond to the complaints raised with them.

The OHCHR receives between 11,000 and 15,000 communications per year. During
2010–11, 1,451 out of 18,000 complaints were submitted for further action by
the WGC. The UNHRC considered four complaints in their 19th session in 2012.
The majority of the situations that have been considered have since been
discontinued.[_citation needed_]

History shows that the procedure works almost in a petition like way; if
enough complaints are received then the UNHRC is very likely to assign a
special rapporteur to the state or to the issue at hand. It has been said that
an advantage of the procedure is the confidential manner, which offers the
ability to engage with the state concerned through a more [diplomatic]
process, which can produce better results than a more adversarial process of
public accusation.

The procedure is considered by some a useful tool to have at the disposal on
the international community for situations where naming and shaming has proved
ineffective. Also another advantage is that a complaint can be made against
any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a particular
treaty.[_citation needed_]

Due to the limited information that is provided on the complaints procedure it
is hard to make comments on the process itself, the resources it uses versus
its effectiveness.

#### Other subsidiary bodies

In addition to the UPR, the Complaint Procedure, and the Advisory Committee,
the UNHRC's other subsidiary bodies include:

  * _Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples_ , which replaced the CHR's Working Group on Indigenous Populations
  * _Forum on Minority Issues_ , a platform for promoting dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to national or ethnic, religious, and linguistic minorities
  * _Social Forum_ , a space for dialogue between the representatives of Member States, civil society, including grass-roots organizations, and intergovernmental organizations on issues linked with the national and international environment needed for the promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by all. It was established in 1997 in response to concerns regarding the impact of globalization on the realization of economic, social, and cultural rights. The appointment of Iran as Chair of the 2023 HRC Social Forum, which focused on "the contribution of science, technology, and innovation to promoting human rights, including in the context of post-pandemic recovery", drew condemnation.

### Special procedures

"Special procedures" is the general name given to the mechanisms established
by the Human Rights Council to gather expert observations and advice on human
rights issues in all parts of the world. Special procedures are categorized as
either thematic mandates, which focus on major phenomena of human rights
abuses worldwide, or country mandates, which report on human rights situations
in specific countries or territories. Special procedures can be either
individuals (called "special rapporteurs" or "independent experts"), who are
intended to be independent experts in a particular area of human rights, or
working groups, usually composed of five members (one from each UN region). As
of August 2017 there were 44 thematic and 12 country mandates.

The mandates of the special procedures are established and defined by the
resolution creating them. Various activities can be undertaken by mandate-
holders, including responding to individual complaints, conducting studies,
providing advice on technical cooperation, and engaging in promotional
activities. Generally the special procedures mandate-holders report to the
Council at least once a year on their findings.

#### Special procedures mandate-holders

Mandate-holders of the special procedures serve in their personal capacity,
and do not receive pay for their work. The independent status of the mandate-
holders is crucial to be able to fulfill their functions in all impartiality.
The OHCHR provides staffing and logistical support to aid each mandate-holders
in carrying out their work.

Applicants for Special Procedures mandates are reviewed by a Consultative
Group of five countries, one from each region. Following interviews by the
Consultative Group, the Group provides a shortlist of candidates to the UNHRC
President. Following consultations with the leadership of each regional
grouping, the President presents a single candidate to be approved by the
Member states of the UNHRC at the session following a new mandate's creation
or on the expiration of the term of an existing mandate holder.

Country mandates must be renewed yearly by the UNHRC; thematic mandates must
be renewed every three years. Mandate-holders, whether holding a thematic or
country-specific mandate, are generally limited to six years of service.

The list of thematic special procedures mandate-holders can be found here:

#### Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression

Protest at UN against China's re-election in the Human Rights Council

The amendments to the duties of the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of
Expression, passed by the Human Rights Council on 28 March 2008, gave rise to
sharp criticism from western countries and human rights NGOs. The additional
duty is phrased thus:

    (d) To report on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination, taking into account articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression

(quoted from p. 67 in the official draft record of the council). The amendment
was proposed by Egypt and Pakistan and passed by 27 votes to 15 against, with
three abstentions with the support of other members of the Organisation of the
Islamic Conference, China, Russia, and Cuba. As a result of the amendment over
20 of the original 53 co-sponsors of the main resolution – to renew the
mandate of the Special Rapporteur – withdrew their support, though the
resolution was carried by 32 votes to 0, with 15 abstentions. _Inter alia_ the
delegates from India and Canada protested that the Special Rapporteur now has
as his/her duty to report not only infringements of the rights to freedom of
expression, but in some cases also employment of the rights, which "turns the
special rapporteur's mandate on its head".

Outside the UN, the amendment was criticised by organizations including
Reporters Without Borders, Index on Censorship, Human Rights Watch, and the
International Humanist and Ethical Union, all of whom share the view that the
amendment threatens freedom of expression.

In terms of the finally cast votes, this was far from the most controversial
of the 36 resolutions adapted by the 7th session of the Council. The highest
dissents concerned combating defamation of religions, with 21 votes for, 10
against, and 14 abstentions (resolution 19, pp. 91–97), and the continued
severe condemnation of and appointment of a Special Rapporteur for North
Korea, with votes 22–7 and 18 abstentions (resolution 15, pp. 78–80). There
were also varying degrees of dissent for most of the various reports
criticising Israel; while on the other hand a large number of resolutions were
taken unanimously without voting, including the rather severe criticism of
Myanmar (resolutions 31 and 32), and the somewhat less severe on Sudan
(resolution 16).

## Israel and Palestine

The mandate of the UNHCR's Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian
territories is to investigate human rights violations by Israel. This is
because under international humanitarian law (IHL), as applied by the UNHRC,
Israel is considered the occupying power in the Occupied Palestinian
Territories (OPT), and therefore has the obligation of upholding human rights
throughout the territories which the special rapporteur is tasked with
investigating its adherence to. This was affirmed in an October 2023 report by
the UNHCR's s Francesca Albanese. A July 2024 landmark opinion by the UN's top
court, the International Court of Justice, also reaffirmed this, while stating
that Israel should dismantle settlements in the occupied West Bank and East
Jerusalem, and end its "illegal" occupation of those areas and the Gaza Strip
as soon as possible.

### 2006 creation of Agenda Item 7

The Council voted on 30 June 2006 to review the "Human rights situation in
Palestine and other occupied Arab territories".

> Item 7. _Human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied Arab
> territories_
>
>   * Human rights violations and implications of the Israeli occupation of
> Palestine and other occupied Arab territories
>   * Right to self-determination of the Palestinian people
>

The council voted on 30 June 2006 to make a review of alleged human rights
abuses by Israel a permanent feature of every council session. The Council's
special rapporteur on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is its only expert
mandate with no year of expiry, due to the ongoing nature of the occupation.
The resolution, which was sponsored by Organisation of the Islamic Conference,
passed by a vote of 29 to 12 with five abstentions.

### April 2009: Gaza report

On 3 April 2009, South African Judge Richard Goldstone was named as the head
of the independent United Nations Fact-Finding Mission to investigate
international human rights and humanitarian law violations related to the Gaza
War. The Mission was established by Resolution S-9/1 of the United Nations
Human Rights Council.

On 15 September 2009, the UN Fact-Finding mission released its report which
found that there was evidence "indicating serious violations of international
human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza
conflict, and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes, and
possibly crimes against humanity". The mission also found that there was
evidence that "Palestinian armed groups committed war crimes, as well as
possibly crimes against humanity, in their repeated launching of rockets and
mortars into Southern Israel". The mission called for referring either side in
the conflict to the UN Security Council for prosecution at the International
Criminal Court if they refuse to launch fully independent investigations by
December 2009.

Goldstone has since partially retracted the report's conclusions that Israel
committed war crimes, as new evidence has shed light upon the decision making
by Israeli commanders. He said, "I regret that our fact-finding mission did
not have such evidence explaining the circumstances in which we said civilians
in Gaza were targeted, because it probably would have influenced our findings
about intentionality and war crimes."

### July 2015: resolution

On 3 July 2015, UNHRC voted Resolution A/HRC/29/L.35 "ensuring accountability
and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied
Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem". It passed by 41 votes in
favor including the eight sitting EU members (France, Germany, Britain,
Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, Latvia and Estonia), one against (the
United States) and five absentions (India, Kenya, Ethiopia, Paraguay and the
Republic of Macedonia). India explained that its abstention was due to the
reference to International Criminal Court (ICC) in the resolution whereas
"India is not a signatory to the Rome Statute establishing the ICC".

### 2018 onwards

On 9 July 2021, Michael Lynk, the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories, addressing a session of the UN Human Rights
Council in Geneva said that Israeli settlements in the West Bank amount to a
war crime, and calling on countries to inflict a cost on Israel for its
illegal occupation. Israel, which does not recognize Lynk's mandate, boycotted
the session.

On 21 March 2022, Lynk submitted a report, stating that Israel's control over
the West Bank and Gaza Strip amounts to apartheid, an "institutionalised
regime of systematic racial oppression and discrimination". The Israeli
Foreign Ministry and other Israeli and Jewish organizations labelled Lynk as
hostile to Israel and the report baseless.

Following the 2021 Israel–Palestine crisis, the council voted on 27 May 2021
to set up a United Nations fact-finding mission to investigate possible war
crimes and other abuses committed in Israel and the occupied Palestinian
territories. The commission will report to the Human Rights Council annually
from June 2022. Unlike previous fact finding missions the inquiry is open
ended and will examine "all underlying root causes of recurrent tensions,
instability and protraction of conflict, including systematic discrimination
and repression based on national, ethnic, racial or religious identity."

Human Rights Watch agreed that the deteriorating situation in the Occupied
Palestinian Territories should be considered by the Council, and urged it to
look at international human rights and humanitarian law violations committed
by Palestinian armed groups as well, which the Council has done. HRW also
called on the Council to avoid the selectivity that discredited its
predecessor and urged it to hold special sessions on other urgent situations,
such as that in Darfur.

In 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan argued that the UNHRC should not have
a "disproportionate focus on violations by Israel. Not that Israel should be
given a free pass. Absolutely not. But the Council should give the same
attention to grave violations committed by other states as well".

On 20 June 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement that read:
"The Secretary-General is disappointed at the Council's decision to single out
only one specific regional item given the range and scope of allegations of
human rights violations throughout the world." Ban Ki-moon also reiterated the
importance of investigating and upholding international humanitarian law with
respect to the Israeli occupied Palestinian territories, stating in 2016 that
"History proves that people will always resist occupation...Palestinian
frustration and grievances are growing under the weight of nearly a half-
century of occupation. Ignoring this won't make it disappear. No one can deny
that the everyday reality of occupation provokes anger and despair, which are
major drivers of violence and extremism and undermine any hope of a negotiated
two-state solution."

Former president of the Council Doru Costea, the European Union, Canada, the
United States and Britain have at various times accused the UNHRC of focusing
disproportionately on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation
of the West Bank.

Speaking at the IDC's Herzliya Conference in Israel in January 2008, Dutch
Foreign Minister Maxime Verhagen criticized the actions of the Human Rights
Council actions against Israel. "At the United Nations, censuring Israel has
become something of a habit, while Hamas's terror is referred to in coded
language or not at all. The Netherlands believes the record should be set
straight, both in New York and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva",
Verhagen said.

In 2008 UNHRC released a statement calling on Israel to stop its military
operations in the Gaza Strip and to open the Strip's borders to allow the
entry of food, fuel and medicine. UNHRC adopted the resolution by a vote of 30
to 1, with 15 states abstaining.

"Unfortunately, neither this resolution nor the current session addressed the
role of both parties. It was regretful that the current draft resolution did
not condemn the rocket attacks on Israeli civilians," said Canada's
representative Terry Cormier, the lone voter against.

The United States and Israel boycotted the session. U.S. ambassador Warren
Tichenor said the Council's unbalanced approach had "squandered its
credibility" by failing to address continued rocket attacks against Israel.
"Today's actions do nothing to help the Palestinian people, in whose name the
supporters of this session claim to act," he said in a statement. "Supporters
of a Palestinian state must avoid the kind of inflammatory rhetoric and
actions that this session represents, which only stoke tensions and erode the
chances for peace", he added. "We believe that this council should deplore the
fact that innocent civilians on both sides are suffering", Slovenian
Ambassador Andrej Logar said on behalf of the seven EU states on the council.

At a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
responded when asked about its special session on Gaza, that "I appreciate
that the council is looking in-depth into this particular situation. And it is
rightly doing so. I would also appreciate it if the council will be looking
with the same level of attention and urgency at all other matters around the
world. There are still many areas where human rights are abused and not
properly protected", he said.

Dugard was succeeded in 2008 by Jewish Professor of international law Richard
Falk, who has compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians with the Nazis'
treatment of Jews during the Holocaust. After a conflict with the Palestinian
Authority's Mahmoud Abbas over his decision, under US pressure, to delay a
UNHCR vote on Richard Goldstone's report on violations of international
humanitarian law during the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza war, widely criticized among
Palestinians including calls on Abbas to stand down and the PA to be
dissolved, Abbas informally asked Falk to resign, accusing him of being among
other things "a partisan of Hamas". Falk disputed this and called the reasons
given "essentially untrue", with the actual motivation behind his call on
Abbas to cease his delaying of the UNHRC vote. The Israeli government
announced it would deny Falk a visa to Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza
Strip, at least until the September 2008 meeting of the UNHCR.

In July 2011, Richard Falk posted a cartoon that critics have described as
anti-Semitic onto his blog. The cartoon depicted a bloodthirsty dog with the
word "USA" on it wearing a kippah, or Jewish head covering. In response, Falk
was heavily criticized by world leaders in the United States, certain European
countries and Israel.

At UNHRC's opening session in February 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton criticized the council's "structural bias" against the State of
Israel: "The structural bias against Israel – including a standing agenda item
for Israel, whereas all other countries are treated under a common item – is
wrong. And it undermines the important work we are trying to do together."

In March 2012, the UNHRC was criticized for facilitating an event in the UN
Geneva building featuring a Hamas politician. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu castigated the UNHRC's decision stating, "He represents an
organization that indiscriminately targets children and grown-ups, and women
and men. Innocents – is their special favorite target". Israel's ambassador to
the UN Ron Prosor denounced the speech stating that Hamas was an
internationally recognized terrorist organization that targeted civilians.
"Inviting a Hamas terrorist to lecture to the world about human rights is like
asking Charles Manson to run the murder investigation unit at the NYPD", he
said.

The United States urged UNHRC in Geneva to stop its anti-Israel bias. It took
particular exception to the council's Agenda Item 7, under which at every
session, Israel's human rights record is debated. No other country has a
dedicated agenda item. The US Ambassador to UNHRC Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe
said that the United States was deeply troubled by the "Council's biased and
disproportionate focus on Israel." She said that the hypocrisy was further
exposed in the Golan Heights resolution that was advocated by the Syrian
regime at a time when it was murdering its own citizens.

On 19 June 2018, the United States pulled out of the UNHRC accusing the body
of bias against Israel and a failure to hold human rights abusers accountable.
Nikki Haley, US Ambassador to the UN, called the organisation a "cesspool of
political bias". At UNHRC's 38th Session on 2 July 2018, Western nations _de
facto_ boycotted Agenda Item 7 by not speaking to it. Israel had been
condemned in 78 resolutions by the Council since its creation in 2006—more
resolutions condemning Israel than the rest of the world combined.

## Other specific issues

### Indigenous peoples (EMRIP)

The Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP) was
established by the Human Rights Council, in 2007, with its mandate amended in
September 2016. This body provides the HRC with expert advice on the rights of
indigenous peoples, and helps member states to achieve the goals of the United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

### United States and UNHRC President

The Council's charter preserves the watchdog's right to appoint special
investigators for countries whose human rights records are of particular
concern, something many developing states have long opposed. A Council meeting
in Geneva in 2007 caused controversy after Cuba and Belarus, both accused of
abuses, were removed from a list of nine special mandates. The list, which
included North Korea, Cambodia and Sudan, had been carried forward from the
defunct Commission. Commenting on Cuba and Belarus, the UN statement said that
Ban noted "that not having a Special Rapporteur assigned to a particular
country does not absolve that country from its obligations under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights."

The United States said a day before the UN statement that the Council deal
raised serious questions about whether the new body could be unbiased.
Alejandro Wolff, US Deputy Permanent Representative at the United Nations,
accused the council of "a pathological obsession with Israel" and also
denounced its action on Cuba and Belarus. The UNHRC President Doru Costea said
that he agreed with Wolff, saying that the functioning of the Council needed
continuous improvement. He added that the Council must examine the behaviour
of all parties involved in complex disputes and not place just one state under
the magnifying glass.

### Defamation of religion

From 1999 to 2011, the CHR and the UNHRC adopted resolutions in opposition to
the "defamation of religion".

### Climate change

The Human Rights Council has adopted the Resolution 10/4 about human rights
and climate change.[_when?_] At its 48th the Council in Resolution 13
(A/HRC/48/13) recognized the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable
environment.[_when?_]

### Responses to crises

#### 2006: Lebanon conflict

At its Second Special Session in August 2006, the Council announced the
establishment of a High-Level Commission of Inquiry charged with probing
allegations that Israel systematically targeted and killed Lebanese civilians
during the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. The resolution was passed by a vote
of 27 in favour to 11 against, with 8 abstentions. Before and after the vote
several member states and NGOs objected that by targeting the resolution
solely at Israel and failing to address Hezbollah attacks on Israeli
civilians, the Council risked damaging its credibility. The members of the
Commission of Inquiry, as announced on 1 September 2006, were Clemente Baena
Soares of Brazil, Mohamed Chande Othman of Tanzania, and Stelios Perrakis of
Greece. The Commission noted that its report on the conflict would be
incomplete without fully investigating both sides, but that "the Commission is
not entitled, even if it had wished, to construe [its charter] as equally
authorizing the investigation of the actions by Hezbollah in Israel", as the
Council had explicitly prohibited it from investigating the actions of
Hezbollah.

#### 2015: Eritrea

In June 2015, a 500-page UNHRC report accused Eritrea's government of
widespread human rights violations. These were alleged to include
extrajudicial executions, torture, indefinitely prolonged national service and
forced labour, and widespread sexual harassment, rape and sexual servitude by
state officials. _The Guardian_ said that the report "catalogues a litany of
human rights violations by the 'totalitarian' regime of President Isaias
Afwerki 'on a scope and scale seldom witnessed elsewhere'". The report also
asserted that these serial violations might amount to crimes against humanity.

The Eritrean Foreign Ministry responded by describing the Commission's report
as "wild allegations", "totally unfounded and devoid of all merit", and
countercharged the UNHRC with "vile slanders and false accusations".

The vice chairperson of the subcommittee on human rights at the European
Parliament said the report detailed "very serious human rights violations",
and said that EU funding for development would not continue as at present
without change in Eritrea.

#### August 2018: Myanmar

In August 2018, the UNHRC released a research report concluding that six
generals in Myanmar armed forces should be prosecuted for war crimes as
related to the genocide against the Rohingya Muslims. The UNHRC conducted 875
individual interviews as part of this research, confirming that the Myanmar
army led a pogrom that claimed the lives of more than 10,000 Rohingyas.

#### 2018–2019: Yemen

A 2019 report for the UNHRC has said the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
have committed war crimes during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen.

#### November 2020: Egypt

The United Nations condemned the November 2020 arrest of three Egyptian human
rights advocates of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). The
activists were charged and detained for having a connection to terror groups.
EIPR said the detention was a "clear and co-ordinated response" of their work
against human rights violations in the country and the detention of the head
of EIPR, Gasser Abdel-Razek, was an attempt to end the human rights work in
Egypt.

#### 2022: Russia's invasion of Ukraine

The United Nations Human Rights Council voted 32–2 on 4 March 2022, with 13
abstentions, to create the International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, an
independent committee of three human rights experts with a mandate to
investigate alleged violations of human rights and of international
humanitarian law in the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

At its eleventh emergency special session, the UN General Assembly adopted a
resolution, with the required two-thirds majority of voting members, to
suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council over reports of gross and
systematic violations and abuses of human rights in the 2022 Russian invasion
of Ukraine. The measure required a two-thirds majority of the countries
present and voting, not counting abstentions. The measure passed with 93 in
favor, 24 against and 58 abstentions. After the suspension, Russia's Deputy
Permanent Representative, Gennady Kuzmin, announced that Russia had decided to
withdraw its Human Rights Council membership altogether. Doing so, Russia
restored its rights as an observer to participate in the council's
proceedings, while it lost the possibility to have its membership reinstated
and to vote or present motions.

#### November 2022: Iran

On 24 November 2022, the council held a special session on the deteriorating
human rights situation in Iran, in particular with regard to women and
children.

#### April 2024: Israel

On 5 April 2024, the council held a special session on the deteriorating
possible war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza Strip, in
particular with regard to genocide in Gaza. The council voted in favour of a
halt in all arms sales to Israel.

## Candidacy issues

### Syria

In July 2012, Syria announced that it would seek a UNHRC seat. This was while
there was serious evidence (provided by numerous human rights organizations
including the UN itself) that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had authorised
and funded the slaughter of thousands of civilians, with estimates of 14,000
civilians being killed as of July 2012 during the Syrian civil war. According
to UN Watch, Syria's candidacy was virtually assured under the prevailing
election system. Syria would have been responsible for promoting human rights
if elected. In response, the United States and European Union drafted a
resolution to oppose the move. In the end, Syria was not on the ballot for the
12 November 2012 election to UNHRC.

### Sudan and Ethiopia

In July 2012, it was reported that Sudan and Ethiopia were nominated for a
UNHRC seat, despite being accused by human rights organizations of grave human
rights violations. UN Watch condemned the move to nominate Sudan, pointing out
that Sudan's President Omar Al-Bashir was indicted for genocide by the
International Criminal Court. According to UN Watch, Sudan was virtually
assured of securing a seat. A joint letter of 18 African and international
civil society organizations urged foreign ministers of the African Union to
reverse its endorsement of Ethiopia and Sudan for a seat, accusing them of
serious human rights violations and listing examples of such violations, and
stating that they should not be rewarded with a seat. Sudan was not on the
ballot for the 12 November 2012 election to UNHRC, but Ethiopia was elected.

### Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabian-led airstrikes in Yemen, June 2015. Saudi Arabia is operating
without a UN mandate.

In September 2015, Faisal bin Hassan Trad, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the UN
in Geneva, was elected Chair of the UNHRC Advisory Committee, the panel that
appoints independent experts. UN Watch executive director Hillel Neuer said:
"It is scandalous that the UN chose a country that has beheaded more people
this year [2015] than ISIS to be head of a key human rights panel. Petro-
dollars and politics have trumped human rights." Saudi Arabia also shut down
criticism, during the UN meeting. In January 2016, Saudi Arabia executed the
prominent Shia cleric Sheikh Nimr who had called for free elections in Saudi
Arabia.

On 13 October 2020, Saudi Arabia lost its bid to win a seat on the U.N. Human
Rights Council. Saudi Arabia and China were competing for membership in a
five-way race for four spots with Pakistan, Uzbekistan, and Nepal. China
received 139 votes, Uzbekistan 164, Pakistan 169 votes, and Saudi Arabia came
in fifth with 90 votes, beaten by Nepal with 150 votes. Human Rights Watch
condemned the candidacy filed by China and Saudi Arabia, calling them "two of
the world's most abusive governments".

### Venezuela

When the UN General Assembly voted to add Venezuela to the UN Human Rights
Council in October 2019, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft
wrote: "I am personally aggrieved that 105 countries voted in favor of this
affront to human life and dignity. It provides ironclad proof that the Human
Rights Council is broken, and reinforces why the United States withdrew."
Venezuela had been accused of withholding from the Venezuelan people
humanitarian aid delivered from other nations, and of manipulating its voters
in exchange for food and medical care. The council had been criticized
regularly for admitting members who were themselves suspected of human rights
violations.

Sri Lanka came under increasing scrutiny in early 2012 after a presentation of
a draft UNHRC resolution addressing their accountability with regard to their
reconciliation activities, a resolution which was subsequently tabled by the
United States. The original draft resolution from the United States noted the
UNHRC "concern that the LLRC [Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]
report [did] not adequately address serious allegations of violations of
international law". The UNHRC resolution then:

    

    "1. Calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the constructive recommendations in the LLRC report and take all necessary additional steps to fulfill its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans,
    2\. Requests that the Government of Sri Lanka present a comprehensive action plan as expeditiously as possible detailing the steps the Government has taken and will take to implement the LLRC recommendations and also to address alleged violations of international law,
    3\. Encourages the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special procedures to provide, and the Government of Sri Lanka to accept, advice and technical assistance on implementing those steps and requests the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to present a report to the Council on the provision of such assistance at its twenty-second session."

Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva Tamara Kunanayakam pointed out that 80% of the
UNHRC's funding requirements are supplied by powerful nations such as the
United States and its allies. Also, key positions in the UNHRC are mostly held
by those who have served in the foreign services of such countries. Sri
Lanka's position is that this fact is significantly detrimental to the
impartiality of the UNHRC activities, especially when dealing with the
developing world. As a result, Sri Lanka, along with Cuba and Pakistan,
sponsored a resolution seeking transparency in funding and staffing the UNHRC,
during its 19th session starting in February 2012. The resolution was adopted
on 4 April 2012.

The original US UNHRC draft resolution that prompted the Sri Lankan, Cuban,
and Pakistani transparency initiative was thereafter significantly modified,
and passed in 2013. Narayan Lakshman, writing from Washington, D.C. for _The
Hindu_ , said the United States "watered down" the resolution, while UN Watch
described the revised resolution as "toned down". Lakshman noted that "an
entire paragraph calling for 'unfettered access'... by a host of external
observers and specialists was deleted", and the reworded resolution's demand
for international investigation into "alleged human rights violations" was
elevated but then "veer[ed] off towards an apparent preference for Sri Lanka
to conduct its own internal investigation". He noted that in general "weaker
language has been inserted in place of more condemnatory tone". The revised
resolution remained entitled "Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in
Sri Lanka" and was assigned UN code "A/HRC/22/L.1/Rev.1". As finally
submitted, the U.S. resolution was co-sponsored by 33 countries, including
three other members of the U.N. Security council at that time (the UK, France,
and Germany), and four other European nations (Ireland, Italy, the
Netherlands, and Switzerland). By a vote of 25 in favor—which included the
resolution sponsors and other EU countries, as well as South Korea—and 13
against, the resolution was adopted on 21 March 2013 (with nine countries
abstaining or absent).

### United States

The 43rd U.S. President George W. Bush declared that the United States would
not seek a seat on the Council, saying it would be more effective from the
outside. He did pledge, however, to support the Council financially. State
Department spokesman Sean McCormack said, "We will work closely with partners
in the international community to encourage the council to address serious
cases of human rights abuse in countries such as Iran, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma,
Sudan, and North Korea".

The U.S. State Department said on 5 March 2007 that, for the second year in a
row, the United States had decided not to seek a seat on the Human Rights
Council, asserting the body had lost its credibility with repeated attacks on
Israel and a failure to confront other rights abusers. Spokesman Sean
McCormack said the council had had a "singular focus" on Israel, while
countries such as Cuba, Myanmar and North Korea had been spared scrutiny. He
said that though the United States will have only an observer role, it will
continue to shine a spotlight on human rights issues. The most senior
Republican member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, supported the administration decision.
"Rather than standing as a strong defender of fundamental human rights, the
Human Rights Council has faltered as a weak voice subject to gross political
manipulation," she said.

Upon passage of UNHRC's June 2007 institution-building package, the U.S.
restated its condemnation of bias in the institution's agenda. Spokesman Sean
McCormack again criticised the Commission for focusing on Israel in light of
many more pressing human rights issues around the world, such as Sudan or
Myanmar, and went on to criticise the termination of special rapporteurs to
Cuba and Belarus, as well as procedural irregularities that prevented member-
states from voting on the issues; a similar critique was issued by the
Canadian representative. In September 2007, the US Senate voted to cut off
funding to the council.

The United States joined with Australia, Canada, Israel, and three other
countries in opposing the UNHRC's draft resolution on working rules citing
continuing misplaced focus on Israel at the expense of action against
countries with poor human-rights records. The resolution passed 154–7 in a
rare vote forced by Israel including the support of France, the United
Kingdom, and China, although it is usually approved through consensus. United
States Ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke about the
"council's relentless focus during the year on a single country – Israel,"
contrasting that with failure "to address serious human rights violations
taking place in other countries such as Zimbabwe, DPRK (North Korea), Iran,
Belarus and Cuba." Khalilzad said that aside from condemnation of the
crackdown of the Burmese anti-government protests, the council's past year was
"very bad" and it "had failed to fulfill our hopes".

On 6 June 2008, _Human Rights Tribune_ announced that the United States had
withdrawn entirely from the UNHRC, and had withdrawn its observer status.

The United States boycotted the Council during the George W. Bush
administration, but reversed its position on it during the Obama
administration. Beginning in 2009 however, with the United States taking a
leading role in the organization, American commentators began to argue that
the UNHRC was becoming increasingly relevant.

On 31 March 2009, the administration of Barack Obama announced that it would
reverse the country's previous position and would join the UNHRC; New Zealand
indicated its willingness not to seek election to the council to make room for
the United States to run unopposed, along with Belgium and Norway for the WEOG
seats.

On 19 June 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Ambassador to
the United Nations Nikki Haley announced that the United States, under
President Donald Trump, was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights
Council, accusing the council being "hypocritical and self-serving"; in the
past, Haley had accused it of "chronic anti-Israel bias". "When the Human
Rights Council treats Israel worse than North Korea, Iran, and Syria, it is
the Council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name. It is time for
the countries who know better to demand changes," Haley said in a statement at
the time, pointing to the council's adoption of five resolutions condemning
Israel. "The United States continues to evaluate our membership in the Human
Rights Council. Our patience is not unlimited."

In December 2020, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said that
the UN Human Rights Council was "a haven for despots and dictators, hostile to
Israel, and ineffectual on true human rights crises".

On 8 February 2021, following the election of Joe Biden, Secretary of State
Antony Blinken announced that the Biden administration would
reengage[_clarification needed_] with the UN Human Rights Council.

On 4 February 2025, President Trump reinstituted his policy and again withdrew
from the UN Human Rights Council as part of a larger motion for "ending U.S.
support for radical anti-American UN organizations." A White House Fact sheet
says the UN Human Rights Council "has demonstrated consistent bias against
Israel," and that it “has not fulfilled its purpose and continues to be used
as a protective body for countries committing horrific human rights
violations." However, this withdraw is confusing, since the last US term of
membership already ended on 1 January, spokesperson Pascal Sim responded that
US can't "withdraw" from an organization when they no longer be a member and
automatically be an observer.

### China

On 1 April 2020, China joined the United Nations Human Rights Council.

#### China's Xinjiang policies

In July 2019, UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Australia, Britain,
Canada, France, Spain, Germany, and Japan, signed a joint letter to the UNHRC
condemning China's mistreatment of the Uyghurs and other minority groups,
urging the Chinese government to close the Xinjiang internment camps.

In response, UN ambassadors from 50 countries including Russia, Nigeria,
Pakistan, Philippines, UAE, Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Angola,
Algeria, and Myanmar signed a joint letter to the UNHRC praising China's
"remarkable achievements in Xinjiang" and opposing the practice of
"politicizing human rights issues".

In August 2019, Qatar told the UNHRC president that it had decided to withdraw
from the response letter. Human rights activists praised Qatar's decision.

In October 2022, 17 countries voted in favor, 19 were against, and 11
abstained in a vote to hold a debate on Xinjiang at its next session,
rejecting a Western bid to debate China's Xinjiang abuses.

### Indonesia

In March 2017, at the 34th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council,
Vanuatu made a joint statement on behalf of Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the
Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands raising human rights violations in the
Western New Guinea, declared which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1963,
and requested that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights produce a report.
Indonesia rejected Vanuatu's allegations. Also, a joint NGO statement was
made. More than 100,000 Papuans have died during a 50-year Papua conflict.

The UNHRC expressed grave concern over ongoing human rights violations against
the Papuan people in Indonesia, citing a lack of accountability and
transparency in investigations, hindering reparations for victims.
Recommendations were made to intensify efforts to combat impunity and
prioritize investigations and reparations for victims.

## Criticism

The United States opposed the creation of the UNHRC during the George W. Bush
administration to protest the repressive states among its membership. In March
2009 the Obama administration reversed that position and decided to "reengage"
and seek a seat on the UNHRC. With the United States taking a leading role in
the organization, American commentators began to argue that the UNHRC was
becoming increasingly relevant.

The UNHRC has been criticised for the repressive states among its membership.
Countries with questionable human rights records that have served on the UNHRC
include Pakistan, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, China, Indonesia, and Russia.

In June 2021, US senator Bob Menendez, then Chair of the United States Senate
Committee on Foreign Relations, joined over 60 lawmakers from 18 countries in
urging the United Nations to launch a Commission of Inquiry into alleged
genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang. The letter, coordinated by
the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, cited credible evidence of
systematic abuses against Uyghurs and criticized the UN Human Rights Council
over failure to hold China accountable.

On 12 October 2021, the Human Rights Watch criticised UNHRC elections and
stated that UN member countries should refrain from voting for Cameroon,
Eritrea, United Arab Emirates, and other candidates as they hold abysmal
rights records. These countries were alleged not to meet the qualifications
for membership on the board. The UN director at Human Rights Watch, Louis
Charbonneau said that electing such serious rights abusers sends a terrible
message that the UN member states do not take the council's fundamental
mission to protect human rights seriously.

### Bloc voting

A Reuters report in 2008 said that independent human rights groups say that
UNHRC is being controlled by some Middle East and African nations, supported
by China, Russia and Cuba, which protect each other from criticism. This drew
criticism from the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the ineffectiveness of
UNHRC, saying it had fallen short of its obligations. He urged countries to
"drop rhetoric" and rise above "partisan posturing and regional divides" and
get on with defending people around the world.

Of the 53 countries which defended China's imposition of the Hong Kong
National Security Law following the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, at least 43
were participants in the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, with one Axios
reporter noting that "Beijing has effectively leveraged the UN Human Rights
Council to endorse the very activities it was created to oppose."

Ban Ki-moon also appealed for the United States to fully join the council and
play a more active role.

The UNHRC was criticized in 2009 for adopting a resolution submitted by Sri
Lanka praising its conduct in Vanni that year, ignoring pleas for an
international war crimes investigation.

### Accountability programme

On 18 June 2007, one year after holding its first meeting, the UNHRC adopted
its _Institution-building package_ , to guide it in its future work. Among its
elements was the Universal Periodic Review, which assesses the human rights
situations in all 193 UN member states. Another element is an _Advisory
Committee_, which serves as the UNHRC's _think tank_ and provides it with
expertise and advice on thematic human rights issues. A further element is a
_Complaint procedure_, which allows individuals and organizations to bring
complaints about human rights violations to the attention of the council.
