Teaching institute of the United Nations

The **United Nations Institute for Training and Research** (**UNITAR**) is a
dedicated training arm of the United Nations system. UNITAR provides training
and capacity development activities to assist mainly developing countries with
special attention to Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Small Island Developing
States (SIDS) and other groups and communities who are most vulnerable,
including those in conflict situations.

## History

The idea of a United Nations training and research institute was mentioned for
the first time in a 1962 resolution of the UN General Assembly. UNITAR was
founded in 1963, following the recommendation of the UN Economic and Social
Council to the General Assembly, which commissioned the UN Secretary-General
with the establishment of a United Nations Institute for Training and Research
as an autonomous body within the UN system.

The creation of UNITAR coincided with the addition of 36 States since 1960,
including 28 African States to the United Nations. That unprecedented wave of
decolonization created a critical need for assistance, as many of the newly
independent States lacked the capacity to train their young diplomats. Shaped
by its first four Executive Directors originally from newly independent
African States, the Institute's vision of training was developed considering
the very needs and priorities of recipient countries.

UNITAR commenced functioning in March 1965. The Institute originally had its
headquarters based in New York City. In 1993, UNITAR's headquarters were
transferred to Geneva (Switzerland).

## UNITAR today

Multiculturalism

The Institute provides training and learning services to national and local
government officials of UN member states and civil society representatives
from around the world. UNITAR strives to respond to the growing demand from UN
member States, especially the Least Developed Countries, for capacity
development in the thematic areas of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development.

UNITAR helps governments to understand climate change, chemicals and waste
management, and green economy. The institute also assists ministries of
finance through its courses on public debt management, finance and trade, and
it provides government officials with training in Peacekeeping and conflict
prevention. Through the United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT), the
Institute supports United Nations funds, programmes, specialized agencies and
Member States with satellite imagery analysis over their respective
territories, and provide training and capacity development in the use of
geospatial information technologies.

Since 2003, UNITAR provides courses to support municipal and regional leaders
dealing with complex public policies.

Another task of the institute is to organize knowledge sharing events for the
UN Secretary-General, including the annual seminar for Special Representatives
of the UN Secretary-General as well as strategic meetings for UN Departments.
UNITAR also spearheads UN inter-agency initiatives such as the one UN Learning
Platform on Climate Change or the Global Migration Group.

UNITAR's research activities are focusing on knowledge systems and their
practical applications. They support the Institute's training activities
through the provision of learning environments adapted to respond to the needs
of adult learners, thus facilitating the increase, efficiency and outreach of
the Institute's capacity development activities.
