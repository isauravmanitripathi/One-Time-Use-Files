The **International Pacific Halibut Commission** (**IPHC**) is an
International Fisheries Organization, having Canada and the United States as
its members, responsible for the management of stocks of Pacific halibut or
_Hippoglossus stenolepis_ within the Pacific waters of its member states. It
was founded by an international treaty concluded on March 2, 1923. The
original treaty has been revised three times (in 1953, 1976, and 1979). The
1979 amendment clarified the role of the IPHC in the management of the fishery
through the North Pacific Halibut Act of 1982.

It has carried out many activities including the use of chartered commercial
fishing vessels to undertake bottom trawls and long-lining for sampling fish
stocks, banding fish, recording water temperatures using bathythermographs,
etc., in the North Pacific and Bering Sea for many years. Also, staff have
been stationed at on-shore fish processing plants to sample catches, remove
otoliths to determine the age of the fish, and many other research activities.
The commission holds a regularly Annual Meetings and occasionally Special
Meetings as necessary.

Its offices were located on the campus of the University of Washington until
November 2010. The IPHC has since moved its offices to the Interbay
neighborhood of Seattle.
