European organization

The **Assembly of European Regions** (**AER**) is the largest independent
network of regions in wider Europe. Bringing together regions from 25
countries and 15 interregional organizations, AER is a forum for interregional
cooperation.

## Historical background

On 15 June 1985, at Louvain-la-Neuve (Walloon Brabant), 47 Regions and 9
interregional organizations founded the Council of the Regions of Europe
(CRE), which would later become the Assembly of European Regions in November
1987 at the second General meeting of the Regions of Europe in Brussels.

The year 1985 was proclaimed by the United Nations as the International Youth
Year. The same year AER launched its first programme, _Eurodyssey_ , designed
to promote and encourage youth mobility.

In 1990, AER's Tabula Regionum Europae released the inaugural map depicting
Europe not solely as a collection of countries but as regions. The following
year, the principle of subsidiarity emerged as AER's flagship initiative,
advocating for the involvement of regions in European and national decision-
making. Its impact was swiftly recognized, culminating in its inclusion in the
Maastricht Treaty of 1992.

The creation of the Committee of the Regions (CoR) in 1994 and the Chamber of
the Regions in the framework of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities
of Europe (CLRAE) in 1994, exemplified a victory for AER in advocating for the
regions in Europe.

In 1995, AER launched a campaign to promote regionalism in Europe. As a
result, 300 AER members adopted in 1996 the _Declaration on Regionalism in
Europe_ immediately initializing a reference document for new and developing
regions.

In 2002, AER presented its position on the “Future of Europe” to the European
Convention. AER actively contributed to the drafting of the European
Constitution, demonstrating strong political involvement. The final text
included all AER proposals, namely

  * The recognition of the regions as an important level of governance within Europe.
  * The extension of the principle of subsidiarity to regional and local levels.
  * The inclusion of regional cohesion in EU's objectives.

In 2008, AER established the _Youth Regional Network_ , Europe's first and
only platform of regional youth councils, parliaments, and organizations.

## Definition of "Region"

According to the AER statutes, in principle the term "region" refers to a
territorial authority existing at the level immediately below that of the
central government, with its own political representation in the form of an
elected regional assembly.
