Cooperation project between Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and Serbia

The **Craiova Group (Quadrilateral)** , **Craiova Four** , or **C4** is a
cooperation project of four European states – Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and
Serbia – for the purposes of furthering their European integration as well as
economic, transport and energy cooperation with one another. The Group
originated in a summit meeting of the heads of governments of Bulgaria,
Romania and Serbia, held on 24 April 2015 in the Romanian city of Craiova. At
the group's inaugural meeting, Romania's then-Prime Minister Victor Ponta
indicated that he was inspired by the Visegrád Group. Romania and Bulgaria
both joined the European Union in 2007, while Serbia has been in accession
negotiations since 2014. Since 2017 meeting in Varna, Bulgaria and the
inclusion of Greece, meetings have been quadrilateral.

One of the first initiatives, after a meeting in Vidin, Bulgaria, was to
strengthen the telecommunication networks in the border areas of the
countries. Other goals include helping Serbia join the European Union and the
construction of a motorway linking Bucharest, Sofia and Belgrade.

On 2 November 2018, Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov stated that Prime
Minister of Greece Alexis Tsipras proposed joint bid for the 2030 FIFA World
Cup by Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Greece during the meeting in
Thessaloniki.
