The **Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America** (Spanish:
_Foro para el Progreso e Integración de América del Sur_ , **PROSUR** ;
Portuguese: _Fórum para o Progresso e Desenvolvimento da América do Sul_ ,
**PROSUL** , Dutch: _Forum voor de Vooruitgang en Integratie van Zuid-Amerika_
, **FVIZA**) is an initiative by Sebastián Piñera and Iván Duque, for the
creation of an integration body to replace the Union of South American
Nations.

In the words of the Colombian president, who made the announcement on 14
January 2019, PROSUR would be "a South American coordination mechanism for
public policies, in defense of democracy, the independence of powers, the
market economy, the social agenda, with sustainability and with due
application". On 18 February 2019, the President of Chile, Sebastián Piñera,
said "this new forum will be open to all South American countries that meet
two requirements: full validity of the rule of law and full respect for
freedoms and human rights".

It has been characterised as a right-wing response to the left-wing UNASUR.

On April 3, 2022, the new president of Chile, Gabriel Boric, announced that
the country was suspending its participation in the alliance. Suriname joined
the alliance in 2022.

## Summits

The first PROSUR Summit, called the "Meeting of Presidents of South America",
took place on 22 March 2019 in Santiago, Chile. Eight South American countries
taking part (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay and
Peru) signed the _Declaration of Santiago for the renewal and strengthening of
South America_ , which begins the process of creating of PROSUR. The
representatives of Bolivia, Suriname and Uruguay abstained from signing the
declaration. Representatives from Venezuela were not invited to the summit in
Santiago.

The second PROSUR Summit took place on 12 December 2020; due to the COVID-19
pandemic, it was held virtually. The heads of state of Brazil, Chile,
Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru participated in the summit, with Prime
Minister Mark Phillips of Guyana and President Luis Lacalle Pou of Uruguay
invited as special guests. During the summit, the presidency pro tempore was
transferred from its inaugural holder, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera to
Colombian President Iván Duque. A presidential declaration was adopted to
formalize the transfer and promote regional cooperation between its members in
matters related to the pandemic.

The third PROSUR summit was held in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 26–27
January 2022; the 2022 summit of the Pacific Alliance was also held at the
same date and venue. It was attended by five heads of state; its host
President Iván Duque of Colombia, President Mario Abdo Benítez of Paraguay,
President Guillermo Lasso of Ecuador, Prime Minister Mark Phillips of Guyana
and President Sebastián Piñera of Chile. In representation of their respective
countries were Vice-president Hamilton Mourão of Brazil and Foreign Minister
of Peru Óscar Maúrtua. Argentina sent no delegation, while the President-elect
of Chile, Gabriel Boric, declined an invitation by President Sebastián Piñera
to attend the two summits in Colombia. During the summit, Mario Abdo Benítez
succeeded Iván Duque as president pro tempore but attended the summit
virtually due to having tested positive for COVID-19.
