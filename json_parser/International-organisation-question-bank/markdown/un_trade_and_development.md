Permanent intergovernmental body

The Headquarters of UNCTAD are located at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.

**UN Trade and Development** (**UNCTAD**) is an intergovernmental organization
within the United Nations Secretariat that promotes the interests of
developing countries in world trade. It was established in 1964 by the United
Nations General Assembly (UNGA) as the **United Nations Conference on Trade
and Development** but rebranded to its current name on the occasion of its
60th anniversary in 2024. It reports to both the General Assembly and the
United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). UNCTAD is composed of 195
member states and works with non-governmental organizations worldwide; its
permanent secretariat is at UNOG in Geneva, Switzerland.

The primary objective of UNCTAD is to formulate policies relating to all
aspects of development, including trade, aid, transport, finance and
technology. It was created in response to concerns among developing countries
that existing international institutions like GATT (since replaced by the
World Trade Organization), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the
World Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of
developing countries; UNCTAD would provide a forum where developing nations
could discuss and address problems relating to their economic development.

One of UNCTAD's principal achievements was conceiving and implementing the
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which promotes the export of
manufactured goods from developing countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD
was closely associated with the New International Economic Order (NIEO), a set
of proposals that sought to reduce economic dependency and inequality between
developing and developed countries.

UNCTAD conferences ordinarily take place every four years, with the first
occurring in Geneva in 1964; fifteen subsequent meetings have taken place
worldwide, with the most recent held in Bridgetown, Barbados, from 3–8 October
2021 (albeit virtually, due to the COVID-19 pandemic).

UNCTAD has 400 staff members and a biannual (2010–2011) regular budget of
US$138 million in core expenditures and US$72 million in extra-budgetary
technical assistance funds. It is a member of the United Nations Sustainable
Development Group, a consortium of UN entities that work to promote
sustainable socioeconomic development.

### Geneva, 1964

In response to developing countries (Least Developed Country, LDC) anxiety at
their worsening position in world trade, the United Nations General Assembly
voted for a 'one-off' conference. These early discussions paved the way for
new IMF facilities to provide finance for shortfalls in commodity earnings and
for the Generalised Preference Schemes which increased access to Northern
markets for manufactured imports from the South. At Geneva, the LDCs were
successful in their proposal for the conference with its secretariat to become
a permanent organ of the UN, with meetings every four years. At the Geneva
meeting, Raúl Prebisch—a prominent Argentinian economist from the United
Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)—became
the organization's first secretary-general.

### New Delhi, 1968

The New Delhi Conference, held in February and March 1968, was a forum that
allowed developing countries to reach an agreement on the basic principles of
their development policies. The conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for
schemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus in
persuading the North to follow up on UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing
generalized preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was
raised to 1% of the North's GNP, but the developed countries failed to achieve
the target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at
UNCTAD conferences.

The conference led to the International Sugar Agreement, which seeks to
stabilize world sugar prices.

### Santiago, 1972

The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was the third occasion on which
developing countries confronted the rich with the need to use trade and aid
measures more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world.
Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on
the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights
(SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In
Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite
preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and
between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in
the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the
Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal
dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final
agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that
further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm
commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed
by the conference.

### Nairobi, 1976, and Manila, 1979

UNCTAD IV, held in Nairobi in May 1976, showed relative success compared to
its predecessors. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper of April
1979 highlights one reason for success as being down to the 1973 Oil Crisis
and the encouragement of LDCs to make gains through producers of other
commodities. The principal result of the conference was the adoption of the
Integrated Programme for Commodities. The programme covered the principal
commodity exports and its objectives aside from the stabilisation of commodity
prices were: "Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world
inflation", the expansion of processing, distribution and control of
technology by LDCs and improved access to markets.

UNCTAD V, held in Manila in 1979 in the wake of the Nairobi Conference,
focused on the key issues of protectionism in developing countries and the
need for structural change, trade in commodities and manufacturing aid and
international monetary reform, technology, shipping, and economic co-operation
among developing countries. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper
written in 1979 focuses its attention on the key issues regarding the LDCs'
role as the Group of 77 in the international community.

### Belgrade, 1983

The sixth UN Conference on Trade and Development in Belgrade, 6–30 June 1983,
was held against the background of earlier UNCTADs which have substantially
failed to resolve many of the disagreements between the developed and
developing countries and of a world economy in its worst recession since the
early 1930s. The key issues of the time were finance and adjustment, commodity
price stabilisation and trade.

### Bridgetown, 2021

The fifteenth session of UNCTAD was originally scheduled for 2020 but was
delayed until 2021 due to COVID-19. This was the first time the conference was
held in a Small Island Developing State (SIDS).

## Achievements

One of UNCTAD's earliest and most notable accomplishments was the formulation
and implementation of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), which
offered special tariff concessions to exports of manufactured goods by
developing countries. Accepting this argument, the developed countries
formulated the GSP scheme under which manufacturers' exports and imports of
some agricultural goods from the developing countries enter duty-free or at
reduced rates in the developed countries. Since imports of such items from
other developed countries are subject to the normal rates of duties, imports
of the same items from developing countries would enjoy a competitive
advantage.

## Reports

UNCTAD produces a number of topical reports, including:

  * The Trade and Development Report
  * The Trade and Environment Review
  * The World Investment Report
  * The Economic Development in Africa Report
  * The Least Developed Countries Report
  * UNCTAD Statistics
  * Digital Economy Report (formerly known as the _Information Economy Report)_
  * The Review of Maritime Transport
  * The International Accounting and Reporting Issues Annual Review
  * The Technology and Innovation Report

## Other

UNCTAD conducts technical cooperation programmes such as ASYCUDA, DMFAS,
EMPRETEC and WAIPA.

In addition, UNCTAD conducts certain technical cooperation in collaboration
with the World Trade Organization through the joint International Trade Centre
(ITC), a technical cooperation agency targeting operational and enterprise-
oriented aspects of trade development.

UNCTAD hosts the Intergovernmental Working Group of Experts on International
Standards of Accounting and Reporting (ISAR).

### Partnership initiatives

UNCTAD is a founding member of the United Nations Sustainable Stock Exchanges
(SSE) initiative along with the Principles for Responsible Investment, the
United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP-FI), and the UN
Global Compact.
