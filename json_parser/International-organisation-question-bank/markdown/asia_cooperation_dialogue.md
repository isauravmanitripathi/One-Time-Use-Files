Intergovernmental organization

The **Asia Cooperation Dialogue** (**ACD**) is an intergovernmental
organization created on 18 June 2002 to promote Asian cooperation at a
continental level and to ensure coordination among different regional
organizations such as the ASEAN, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Eurasian
Economic Union, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the SAARC. It is
the first international organization to cover the whole of Asia. Its
secretariat is in Kuwait City.

## History

The idea of the Asia Cooperation Dialogue was raised at the First
International Conference of Asian Political Parties (held in Manila in
September 2000) by Surakiart Sathirathai, then deputy leader of the now
defunct Thai Rak Thai Party, on behalf of his party leader, Thaksin
Shinawatra, then Prime Minister of Thailand. It was suggested that Asia as a
continent should have its own forum to discuss Asia-wide cooperation.
Afterwards, the idea of the ACD was formally put forward during the 34th ASEAN
Foreign Ministers Meeting in Hanoi in July 2001 and at the ASEAN Foreign
Ministers Retreat in Phuket in February 2002.
