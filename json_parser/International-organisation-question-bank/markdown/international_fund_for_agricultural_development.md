Specialised agency of the United Nations

The **International Fund for Agricultural Development** (**IFAD)** is an
international financial institution and a specialised agency of the United
Nations that works to address poverty and hunger in rural areas of developing
countries. It is the only multilateral development organization that focuses
solely on rural economies and food security.

IFAD is involved in over 200 projects across nearly 100 countries. It funds
and sponsors initiatives that improve land and water management, develop rural
infrastructure, train and educate farmers in more efficient technologies,
build up resilience against climate change, enhancing market accessibility,
and more.

IFAD has 180 member states with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) and members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD). As of 2021, since its foundation, IFAD has provided
US$23.2 billion in loans and grants and coordinated an addition US$31 billion
in international and domestic co-financing.

## History

In the early 1970s, global food shortages led to widespread famine,
malnutrition, and mortality, particularly affecting the Sahel region of
Africa. The world required long-term, coordinated approaches to the structural
issues that were causing destitution and food shortages. IFAD was established
as an international financial institution in 1977 through United Nations
General Assembly Resolution 32/107 (15 December 1977) as one of the major
outcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference. The conference highlighted the
vital importance of addressing food insecurity and poverty in emerging
countries' rural communities. IFAD officially opened its headquarters in Rome,
Italy and convened its first governing council with 120 member states and it
is a member of the United Nations Development Group.

## Vision

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) envisions rural
communities that are inclusive, prosperous, and resilient, free from poverty
and hunger. Acknowledging that agriculture is the primary livelihood for
millions of rural people, IFAD addresses the challenges these communities
face, such as climate adaptation, economic instability, and food insecurity.

Through strategic partnerships and financing, IFAD supports initiatives that
enable rural populations to enhance productivity, access resources, and build
resilience. Its vision includes fostering innovation and advancing policies
that promote equity, with a focus on empowering groups often overlooked, such
as women, Indigenous Peoples, and youth.

## Criticism and debates

IFAD, alongside other United Nations Specialized Agencies and international
aid agencies, has been subject to a wide array of criticism from different
actors.

### Approach to food insecurity and poverty alleviation

**See also** **:** Washington Consensus

IFAD is often perceived as being in line with dominant economic ideologies,
and has seen critiques for falling short in reducing food insecurity and
hunger by not addressing structural challenges of the world economy. The
legacy of neo-liberal policies pushed for by international development
agencies has often drawn criticism, and although IFAD specifically targets
small-scale actors, prevalent debates about agriculture and aid effectiveness
extend to the role played by institutions such as IFAD. Many scholars oppose
the status quo and call for a change in the approach to food insecurity as
illustrated with the quote “The global food system, driven by neoliberal
economic policies, has transformed agriculture into an instrument for economic
development, often at the expense of local communities' food security and
autonomy”.

### Financialization of agriculture

The financialization of agriculture refers to the rising involvement of
finance in agriculture, which can take the form of access to credit markets,
commodification and trade of agricultural products, evolving regulations (to
allow new financial agreements between actors) and more. IFAD has targeted
financialization as a way of supporting food production and allowing markets
to deliver solutions. As such, some scholars have been vocal in their
criticism of financialization and its shortcomings, by exacerbating
inequalities (concentrating wealth among financial elites and agribusiness
corporations), heightening the fragility of the food system to shocks
(economic and environmental), stifling collective action to build ecologically
sound food systems, and leaving small-scale farmers more exposed to price
volatility due to contracted loans and financial derivatives. Moreover, many
have pointed to the commodification and trade of agricultural assets as a
reason for rising food prices around the world.

### Technocracy

IFAD has sometimes been branded by local actors and critiques as Technocratic,
offering one-size fits all solutions to specific contexts. International
development endeavors are often characterized by their multilateral nature,
and the omission of local actors and/or conflicting viewpoints may undermine
poverty alleviation efforts.

### Interpretation of mandate and constituent instruments

In 2009, a report published by Rutsel Martha (general counsel of legal affairs
at IFAD) titled _Mandate issues in the activities of the International Fund
for Agricultural Development (IFAD)_ looked at the issues regarding the
institutions interpretations of its law's: "Every action of an international
organization, including IFAD, expresses or implies some interpretation of the
organization’s law, in particular its constituent instrument. In other words,
IFAD’s actions, like those of other international organizations, imply a view
about the meaning of its law, and are therefore quintessentially
interpretative of the legal regulations that govern its existence and
operations". In this sense, multiple occasions have revealed how IFAD relies
on interpretations and auxiliary instruments to address its mission of
alleviating food insecurity. For example, it bypassed the original prerogative
stating "the Fund can only finance its developing Member States and
intergovernmental organizations in which those States participate" to extend
financing to NGO's under certain conditions.

In the late 1990's and early 2000's, IFAD again bypassed its original mandate
via legal instruments to deliver programs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
under accords with the Palestinian authority which was not a recognized member
state. The chairman of the 21st session of the governing council in his
closing statement stated: "“The long arms of hunger and poverty know no legal
or political boundaries, yet development aid very often faces constraints that
limit its outreach. During this Session we have overcome just such a
constraint by establishing a Fund for Gaza and the West Bank, a territory that
is not a Member State of IFAD. There is indeed satisfaction in overcoming
bounds and in reaching out to PEOPLE not to boundaries”. In response to this,
the United States representative stated that although “the United States
supports international efforts to assist the Palestinian people, not only to
improve day-to-day lives, but also to build a constituency for peace", because
of "US legal restrictions, our contributions and assistance cannot be used for
the proposed IFAD special fund". This situation revealed how IFAD is subject
to judicial and political challenges, which can undermine its mission. Rustel
Martha wrote of the incident that it highlighted "the fact that when
organizations embark on activities which cannot be clearly identified as
having been authorized by the constituent instrument, it may place membership
contribution at risk".

## Structure

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) relies on three key
entities for governance: the governing council, the executive board, and the
president.

### Governing Council

The IFAD is governed by its primary decision-making body, the **Governing
Council** , which holds full powers to make decisions. This council is
composed of representatives from all IFAD Member States and gathers on an
annual basis. It is attended by official delegates such as Governors,
Alternate Governors, and other appointed advisors. Observers, including
representatives from non-member states seeking membership, the Holy See, the
Sovereign Order of Malta, and approved UN agencies, intergovernmental and non-
governmental organizations, are also invited to attend.

The Governing Council has full authority over the fund's operations and makes
decisions on important matters such as the approval of new members, the
election of the President, issues concerning the permanent seat, the
administrative budget, and the establishment of policies, criteria, and
regulations.

Sessions of the Governing Council are led by the _Chairperson of the Bureau_ ,
which is made up of _one Chairperson_ and _two Vice-chairpersons_ , all
elected from among the Governors of member states for a two-year period. The
President also participates in Governing Council meetings without voting
rights.

### Executive Board

The general operations of the fund are managed by the **Executive Board** ,
which exercises authority either directly provided by Agreement of
Establishing the IFAD or delegated by the Governing Council. The Board is made
up of _18 members_ and as many as _18 alternate members_ , all elected from
the fund's members at the annual session of the Governing Council. Each member
serves a three-year term within allocated Lists and Sub-Lists. The fund's
president chairs the executive board, attending its meetings without voting
privileges.

### President

The President of the IFAD is appointed by the Governing Council with a two-
thirds majority vote and serves a term of four years, renewable once. Under
exceptional circumstances, the term may be extended by up to six months on the
recommendation of the executive board. The president oversees the fund's
operations, including organizing the staff and managing appointments and
dismissals, following regulations set by the executive board.

The President may appoint a _Vice-president_ to assist with assigned
responsibilities and serves as the fund's legal representative. The current
President of the IFAD is Alvaro Lario from Spain, who took over from Gilbert
Houngbo in late 2022. His term of office began on 1 October 2022, and will run
until 31 March 2027. As 2024, Álvaro Lario, who serves as the President of
IFAD, took on the additional role of Chair of UN-Water, the United Nations
Inter-Agency Mechanism on All Freshwater Related Issues, Including Sanitation.

## Membership

"Membership of the Fund shall be open to any State member of the United
Nations, or of any of its specialized agencies, or of the International Atomic
Energy Agency. Membership shall also be open to any groupings of States whose
members have delegated to it powers in fields falling within the competence of
the fund, and which is able to fulfil all the obligations of a Member of the
Fund" (Art. 3, sec. 1 of the Agreement Establishing IFAD).

IFAD currently has 180 member states, categorized into three main groups that
reflect the economic diversity and development priorities of its members.

List A includes high-income countries that contribute significantly to IFAD's
financial resources. These nations have declared themselves ineligible for
IFAD financing and do not qualify for Official Development Assistance (ODA) as
defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
Their role is crucial in providing funding for global agricultural development
initiatives.

List B includes member states from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) that also contribute to IFAD's resources. This category
comprises oil-rich countries that may be eligible for particular agricultural
development initiatives, demonstrating development aid.

List C includes developing nations eligible for IFAD money and services, many
of which also contribute to the organization's resources. This list is divided
into three regional sub-lists: C1 (countries in Africa), C2 (countries in
Europe, Asia, and the Pacific) and C3 (countries in Latin America and
Caribbean).
