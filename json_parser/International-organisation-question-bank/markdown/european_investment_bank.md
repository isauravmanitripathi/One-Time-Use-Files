The **European Investment Bank** (**EIB**) is the European Union's investment
bank and is owned by the 27 member states. It is the largest multilateral
financial institution in the world. The EIB finances and invests both through
equity and debt solutions companies and projects that achieve the policy aims
of the European Union through loans, equity and guarantees.

The EIB focuses on the areas of climate, environment, small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs), development, cohesion and infrastructure. It has played a
large role in providing finance during crises including the 2008 financial
crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 60 years since its inception in 1958 to
2018 the EIB has invested over 1.1 trillion euros. It primarily funds projects
that "cannot be entirely financed by the various means available in the
individual Member States".

The EIB is one of the biggest financiers of green finance in the world. In
2007, the EIB became the first institution in the world to issue green bonds.
In 2019 it committed to stop funding fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021.
The EIB plans to invest 1 trillion euros in climate-related projects by 2030
including a just transition. The EIB is not funded through the budget of the
EU. Instead, it raises money through the international capital markets by
issuing bonds. The EIB is rated triple-A, the most credit-worthy rating on the
bond market, by "the Big Three" credit rating agencies: Moody's, Standard and
Poor's, and Fitch. Each member state pays capital into the EIB's reserves
which is broadly in line with their share of EU gross domestic product.

The EIB was founded by the Treaty of Rome, which came into force on 1 January
1958. It was the first of the world's regional development banks and is
sometimes referred to as the largest multilateral development bank (MDB). The
EIB was established to facilitate equitable development in the EU through
lending to regions that are less developed and to support the EU's internal
market. The EIB is active in 140 countries throughout the world. It makes
around 10% of its investments outside the EU to support the European Union's
development aid and cooperation policies.

The EIB has been criticised and caused controversy for various actions and
inactions of its own (or projects it funded), including: insufficient
stakeholder consultation, lack of organisational transparency, climate change
response, defence and promotion of vegetarian and vegan values, tax avoidance,
and staff harassment.

## EIB role within the EU system

The European Investment Bank is the European Union's bank and is owned by the
member states of the European Union. Its role is to fund projects that achieve
the aims of the European Union.

Most of the EIB's activity (90%) takes place inside the European Union with
the aim of fostering European integration and development. It makes
investments outside Europe to support the EU's development aid and cooperation
policies. It is active in 140 countries which are grouped into: Enlargement
countries, European Free Trade Association (EFTA), EU Southern Neighbourhood,
EU Eastern Neighbourhood, Sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and Pacific, Asia and
Latin America, Central Asia and the United Kingdom.

As an independent body the bank takes its own borrowing and lending decisions.
It cooperates with other EU institutions, especially the European Commission,
the European Parliament, and the Council of the European Union.

## Financial products and services

The EIB lends to both the private and the public sector through various
financial products: Financing is the bank's main activity, it also provides
guidance on how to utilise additional sources of investment.

### Loans

The European Investment Bank provides long-term loans, typically up to 50% of
a project's overall cost, for the public and the private sector, and for small
and medium-sized businesses through intermediated lending partners. The EIB's
private sector financing of single large investment projects or investment
programmes start from €25 million. It offers framework loans starting from
€100 million to public sector entities for investment programmes that consist
of a number of smaller projects. Loans for both private and public sector
projects have to be aligned with one or more priorities of the EIB. Besides
direct debt financing or project finance for the private sector, the EIB makes
loans to intermediaries including Groupe BPCE (France), Deutsche Bank AG
(Germany), or Intesa Sanpaolo (Italy) that provide small and medium-sized
businesses with local and targeted funds up to €12.5 million and below the
EIB's threshold for direct private financing of €25 million.

### Equity

The European Investment Bank invests and co-invests in companies and funds
that focus on infrastructure, environment, or small- and medium-sized
enterprises and mid-size corporations in exchange for equity which allows
companies to raise capital by selling shares for short term costs or to
achieve long-term financial goals. In some cases, the EIB provides direct
quasi-equity financing to support companies aiming for financing to grow which
involves venture debt products for European companies in the field of biotech
and life sciences, software and ICT, engineering and automation, renewables
and clean technology. These investments, which are a relatively recent
addition to the bank's work, tend to be smaller than its previous limits on
the size of its deals, because they are aimed at startups and growth
companies. The European Investment Fund (EIF) supports the EIB by working with
SMEs and related financial partners (banks, guarantee, leasing and
microfinance institutions, private equity and venture capital funds etc.).

The EIB's investments in equity and debt funds usually cover 10% to 20% of the
fund size (with a maximum of 25%) and address climate action, infrastructure,
or private sector development and social impact goals.

### Guarantees

The EIB provides credit enhancement of senior debt using subordinated
financing, funded or unfunded guarantees and contingent credit lines. Credit
enhancement is the process of improving a company's creditworthiness by taking
internal and external measures. The EIB increases the protection of the senior
debt, enhances the credit rating and credit quality for project finance and
aims to help projects attract further private finance from institutional
investors. By offering guarantees to small and medium-sized enterprises or
mid-caps, the bank covers a portion of possible losses from a portfolio of
loans and sets the ground for additional financing. A guarantee is a legal
contract with which a third party (guarantor) promises to assume a borrower's
debt or other liabilities in the event of default.

### Advisory services and technical assistance

The European Investment Bank's advisory services are carried out by the
European Advisory Hub and are available for public and private projects inside
as well as outside the European Union. Besides advice on specific investment
mechanisms or market development, the services can involve strategic and
technical guidance on completing a project. Prior to a funding agreement with
the EIB or other investors, future clients can make use of the bank's
expertise in the fields of financial structuring, procurement and regulation,
or impact assessment, e.g. regarding a project's implications on climate
change. It does not offer advice related to the purchase or sale of securities
or any advisory services regarding project evaluation and audit.

#### fi-compass

fi-compass is a comprehensive advisory service platform developed by the
European Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group. It supports
EU shared management managing authorities and other stakeholders by providing
practical know-how and learning tools on financial instruments across the
Union. Financial instruments co-funded by EU shared management funds, such as
loans, guarantees, and equity investments, are efficient ways to invest in
growth and development across the European Union. These instruments leverage
public funding to attract additional private investments, contributing to EU
policy objectives like economic growth, job creation, and social cohesion. fi-
compass offers tailored advice on using financial instruments under various EU
shared management funds, including the European Regional Development Fund
(ERDF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the
European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), the European Maritime, Fisheries and
Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF), and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund
(AMIF).

### Mandates and partnerships

Apart from financing projects using its own resources, the European Investment
Bank establishes mandates and partnerships which help to fund riskier projects
and to blend loans with grants; which are disbursed funds or products that do
not require repayment. Mandates can also involve financial investment and can
be based on technical and financial advice.

The EIB has partnerships with organisations across the world, including the
European Commission and European External Action Service, the United Nations
(e.g. Sustainable Energy for All) or the International Fund for Agricultural
Development.

## Funding sources

2019 EIB donors conference

The European Investment Bank is a not for profit organisation. While it is a
European Union body, none of the European Investment Bank's funds come from
the European Union budget, the bank is financially autonomous. It has its own
resources and money raised through the international capital markets.

The EIB issues bonds to borrow money on capital markets which it then lends to
its clients, which is a common way for governments and corporations to borrow
money. Both parties agree on a fixed date when the loan is due to be paid back
usually including an interest rate. The EIB's bonds are purchased by retail
investors and institutional investors around the world.

The EIB focuses on long-term investment and is triple-A rated by Moody's,
Standard and Poor's, and Fitch. This allows the bank to borrow money at lower
rates to then lend it at lower rates to projects inside and outside Europe
that foster EU policy objectives.

In addition to benchmark bonds, public bonds, and private placements that vary
in terms of size, currencies, maturities, and structures, the bank offers
Green Bonds and Sustainability Awareness Bonds.

The European Investment Bank issued the first Green Bond in 2007, called a
Climate Awareness Bond. The EIB is the global leader of Green Bonds issuance
with over EUR 30.8bn raised in 2020 across 16 currencies. With the money
raised through Green Bonds, the EIB exclusively supports projects that
contribute to climate action in the renewable energy sector (including wind,
hydroelectric, solar and geothermal energy production) and the energy
efficiency sector (e.g. projects for district heating, co-generation, and
building insulation).

### Shareholders

The European Investment Bank's has capital from its shareholders, the member
states of the European Union. Each member state is subscribed in capital based
on its economic weight (expressed in gross domestic product) within the
European Union at the time of the country's accession to the European Union.

Following Brexit and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European
Union, the European Investment Bank's board of governors decided that the
remaining member states would proportionally increase their capital
subscriptions to maintain the same level of overall subscribed capital (EUR
243.3 billion). As of March 2020, the subscribed capital of the EIB has
increased by an additional EUR 5.5 billion, following the decision by two
member states to increase their capital subscriptions (Poland and Romania).
The EIB's total subscribed capital now amounts to EUR 248.8 billion. The
departure of the UK from the EU did not impact the EIB Group's AAA credit
rating.

## European Investment Bank Group

The EIB Group was formed in 2000. It is composed of the European Investment
Bank (EIB) and the European Investment Fund (EIF) and the EIB Institute.

### European Investment Bank

90% the European Investment Bank's activity takes place inside the European
Union with the aim of fostering European integration and development. It makes
investments outside Europe to support the European Union's development aid and
cooperation policies. It is active in some 140 countries throughout the world
in the following geographical areas: Enlargement countries, European Free
Trade Association (EFTA), EU Southern Neighbourhood, EU Eastern Neighbourhood,
Sub-Saharan Africa, Caribbean and Pacific, Asia and Latin America, Central
Asia and the United Kingdom.

It is one of the largest supranational lenders in the world. Since its
establishment in 1958, the European Investment Bank has invested over a
trillion euros.

### European Investment Fund

The European Investment Fund (EIF) is the European Union's venture capital
arm. It also provides guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). In 2018, 25 million SMEs in the EU made up 99.8% of all non-financial
enterprises, employed around 97.7 million people (66.6% of total employment)
and generated 56.4% of total added value (EUR 4,357bn).

The EIF supports businesses through all their stages of development; pre-seed,
seed-, and start-up-phase (technology transfer, business angel financing,
microfinance, early stage venture capital) to the growth and development
segment (formal venture capital funds, mezzanine funds, portfolio
guarantees/credit enhancement).

The European Investment Bank is the EIF's majority shareholder, holding 62% of
shares. The other main shareholder is the European Commission, which holds 29%
of shares. The EIF operates on the basis of specific mandates from the
European Council and the European Parliament, from the European Commission or
other public authorities, from the European Investment Bank or at its own
risk.

### EIB Institute

In 2012, the EIB Institute was created to promote and support social,
cultural, and academic initiatives with European stakeholders and the public
at large. It works on community and citizenship for the EIB Group. The EIB
Institute is an integral part of the EIB and does not have a separate legal
personality.

## Objectives and activities

EIB anti-corruption conference

The EIB is a not for profit organisation and provides long-term project
funding, guarantees and advice to further the goals of the European Union. It
is part of the European Commission's Investment Plan for Europe strategy which
aims to bridge investment gaps by taking on some of the risk in projects it
funds.

The bank funds projects in the areas of; climate, environment, innovation and
skills, infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises, cohesion and
development as well as crises including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2008
financial crisis. Since 1959 the European Investment Bank has signed almost
25,000 projects around the world. It funds projects both inside and outside
the EU that meet one of the criteria of; in less developed regions, where
projects can not be funded by individual member states and projects which
benefit multiple member states.

The bank aims to support sustainable economic growth both within the member
states of the European Union and externally. Because of its AAA credit rating
in the international markets the EIB is able to borrow and lend at low rates.
The bank pursues the objectives of the European Union by providing long-term
project funding, as well as guarantees and advice. The EIB Group (European
Investment Bank and European Investment Fund) supports companies, small
businesses and start-ups by cooperating with a wide network of commercial
banks, national banks and institutions, leasing companies, venture capital and
private equity funds, angel investors and various providers.

Within the European Commission's Investment Plan for Europe, the EIB Group and
the European Investment Fund for Strategic Investments are part of a plan
aimed at relieving investors of some of the risks inherent in projects.
Project financing is granted after preliminary screenings of the viability and
the carbon emissions associated with the projects.

### COVID-19 response

The European Investment Bank has provided financial resources for both
economic impacts of the pandemic and for health-related emergencies, the
search for a vaccine against COVID-19, and solutions to slow the spread of the
virus.

On 26 May 2020, the EIB Board of Directors approved the Pan-European Guarantee
Fund (EGF), a €25 billion fund which was endorsed by the European Council as
part of the overall European Union COVID-19 response package. All 27 EU member
states were invited to contribute to the fund in the form of guarantees
proportional to the respective share in the bank. Using the EGF, the EIB group
'aimed to mobilise' up to €200 billion of additional financing for small and
medium-sized European businesses from the private sector. European Union
companies are eligible to seek financing from the Pan-European Guarantee Fund
if they have financial issues due to the economic implication of the COVID-19
pandemic but could have been able to secure loans under pre-crisis
circumstances.

In December 2019, the European Investment Bank signed a €50 million loan to
help BioNTech work on cancer treatments. A new loan worth €100 million was
approved in June 2020 to support the company's vaccine trials and
manufacturing. BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine was approved for use by the UK drug
regulators in December 2020.

### Climate

The EIB Group, is one of the world's main financiers of climate action. The
EIB plans to invest 1 trillion euros in climate-related projects by 2030
including a just transition. As the EU's climate Bank, the European Investment
Bank Group committed in November 2019 to align its activities with the goals
and principles of the Paris Agreement by the end of 2020. In November 2020,
the EU member states approved the EIB Group Climate Bank Roadmap 2021–2025
that outlines its upcoming contributions to the European Green Deal and to
sustainable development outside the EU. By the end of 2021, the EIB will stop
financing all fossil fuel projects.

The EIB contributes to the European Green Deal which aims for Europe to become
the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050. It finances projects that; limit
global warming to 1.5 °C by the end of the decade, fight environmental
degradation, stop biodiversity loss and address inequalities caused by climate
change. In 2019, the European Investment Bank Group financed projects for
€19.3 billion to fight climate change.

### Innovation and skills

Since 2000, the EIB has financed projects which include skills development
with more than €210 billion of investment, including €14.4 billion in 2019.
This support targeted/aimed at; the development and commercialisation of new
products, economic processes and business models, increased investment in
research and development, education, upskilling and training and improved
connectivity and access through broadband and mobile networks. In addition;
the adoption and diffusion of digital and other emerging technologies and
empowering women's participation in the labour market.

### Development

The EIB Group finances sustainable projects and supports investments that
reduce poverty and inequality aims with the aim of contributing to stable
growth within the member states of the European Union, emerging markets and
developing countries. Since 2010 the EIB financing outside the European Union
reached €69.6 billion. In 2020 the European Investment Bank Group has offered
loans to more than 100 countries, financed vaccines, diagnostics and
treatments and invested €1.7 billion to help the Western Balkan countries
recover from the COVID-19 pandemic It also expanded its partnership with the
United Nations Development Programme and increased cooperation with the
Association of European Development Finance Institutions to assist impacted
businesses in developing countries, providing financing for €280 million
partnered with the World Health Organization to finance health care projects
in 10 African countries.

### Infrastructure

Since its foundation in 1958, the European Investment Bank has supported the
development of infrastructure for both EU member states and third countries.
In 2019, the EIB provided €15.74 billion to support infrastructure projects.
The EIB supports infrastructure projects involving; sustainable transport;
energy efficiency, urban development, digital networks, social housing and key
public buildings, cultural heritage and water and wastewater management.

### Small to medium size enterprises

The bank is part of InnovFin, the EU Finance for Innovators, a joint
initiative of the EIB Group in cooperation with the European Commission under
Horizon 2020). Through it the EIB Group provides direct financing to mid-caps.
The group also offers venture debt financing under the European Growth Finance
Facility, backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments.

The EIB Group works with a broad network of commercial banks, national
promotional banks and institutions, leasing companies, venture capital and
private equity funds, angel investors and service providers, including in
regions where access to finance is limited. Through intermediaries, the EIB
finances micro-enterprises (0–9 employees), small enterprises (10–49
employees), medium-sized enterprises (50–249 employees), mid-caps (250–3 000
employees).

In 2019 the EIB Group provided €25.52 billion in loans and other services to
386,600 SMEs and mid-caps which employ 4.4 million.

### Cohesion

As a supranational institution, the EIB focuses on economic, social and
territorial cohesion and solidarity within the member states of the European
Union and outside the EU. The EIB prioritises projects addressing inequalities
by providing jobs and education, public infrastructure and services, a
sustainable environment across the European Union. The EIB's annual target for
cohesion financing is 30% of all new operations in the EU, Pre-Accession and
EFTA countries which amounted to €16.13 billion in 2019. In 2023, the EIB
Group invested €36.2 billion in cohesion-related initiatives.

## History

The European Investment Bank was founded by the Treaty of Rome, brought about
the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), which came into force
on 1 January 1958. At the time the role of the bank was to provide financing
in the form of loans for Europe's infrastructure projects.

### 1960s

In 1962 the bank was authorised to finance projects also outside the European
Community (EC), which was created in 1957 by six member states – Italy,
France, West Germany, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands. These countries
had signed the Treaty of Rome to increase the cooperation among the European
countries after World War II. Also in 1962, the EIB issued its first loan
carried out in cooperation with the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The bank loaned funds to three Italian companies: Sincat and
Celene in Sicily, which needed funds to build a petrochemical complex, and
Mercure in Lucania, to exploit a seam of lignite to produce electricity.

In 1968 the EIB moved from Brussels to Luxembourg City, opened an office in
Rome and adopted the global loan facility for small and medium-enterprises
(SME) financing. The growing economies among the member states of the European
Community at the end of the 1950s and through the 1960s meant that the
countries themselves were able to finance their infrastructure development,
which lead to the EIB playing a supporting role.

### 1970s

The 1973–1975 recession in Europe and the first enlargement of the European
Community changed the EIB's role. The financial turmoil affecting the initial
EC members made it more difficult for the individual nations to pursue their
national policy objectives; the addition in 1973 of three new countries to the
European Community – United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark led to the EIB's
first capital enlargement. The larger financial base, coupled with the
development of European-wide policies at the European Parliament, led the bank
to draft its own regional lending policy starting from 1974.

Under its new policy and a more diversified economic and infrastructure
development, the EIB expanded its lending to include industrial development
loans in the depressed industrial regions of the growing EC membership. The
bank benefited from the creation of a new structural fund, the European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF), founded in 1975. The ERDF was created to
provide financial support for the development and structural adjustment of
regional economies, economic change, enhanced competitiveness as well as
territorial cooperation throughout the EU.

The EIB was the first European Community institution to directly handle the
construction of its own headquarters. The purchase of the site on the
Kirchberg plateau was agreed to by the Luxembourg government and the contract
between the grand duchy and the bank concluded in November 1972.

### 1980s

In the 1980 the EIB moved its headquarters to a new building, designed by the
British architect Sir Denys Lasdun. The complex known as West Building was
designed in the brutalist style on the Kirchberg plateau. Construction began
in 1974, inaugurated in 1981 and extended in 1995.

In the 1980s the EIB became responsible for assisting associate countries such
as Greece, Spain, and Portugal in achieving requirements for EC admission. In
1981, Greece joined the EIB and five years later, in 1986, Spain and Portugal
did the same. In 1987 the bank began focusing more on loans to finance small
and medium-sized enterprises, as well as 'innovative' companies,
telecommunications and urban transport initiatives among EC members.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the bank started to finance
projects in former Soviet states, lending to Poland, Romania, Hungary,
Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. The EIB increased investment in
the region toward the late 1990s as these countries prepared their
applications to join the 15 members of what by then had become the European
Union (EU).

### 1990s

In 1991 the bank contributed to the foundation of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and in 1993 it extended its activities
to the Baltic countries (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and to Latin American
and Asian countries. In 1994 the European Investment Fund (EIF)—whose logo
depicts a bridge symbolising the connection between public and private
finance—was established. In 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the EIB.

The European Investment Bank made its first borrowing operation in euros in
1997, over a year before the new European currency was launched, on 1 January
1999. In the same year the bank adopted a new logo which consisted of three
elements: a central blue stripe, representing Europe, and two grey lateral
shapes, representing the headquarters in Luxembourg.

### 2000s

In 2000 the EIB Group was created and the European Investment Bank became the
majority shareholder of the EIF, the specialist arm for providing risk
capital. Also in 2000 the Cotonou Agreement – signed in Benin's largest city
by the 15 member states of the European Union and 78 African, Caribbean and
Pacific Group of States (ACP Countries), replaced the Lomé Convention (1975).
Under the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement, the EIB expanded its cooperation with
non-EU countries outside Europe having agreements with the Union.

Following the Lisbon European Council in 2000, the EIB changed objectives. The
bank continued providing infrastructure and policy support to the European
Union, as well as contributing to achieving the Lisbon summit's stated
objective of making Europe a high-technology and knowledge-based economy.

In 2004, the EIB received a mandate from the European Union for operations in
Russia, Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine. In the same year the Czech Republic,
Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Malta and
Cyprus entered the European Union, followed by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007
and Croatia in 2013.

From 2002, the bank and the European Commission started coordinating their
efforts in investments aimed at mitigation and adaptation to climate change.
In 2007 the EIB issued the first Climate Awareness Bonds on the capital
markets, the world's first Green Bonds. The funds raised were earmarked to
match disbursements to EIB lending projects in the field of renewable energy
and energy efficiency.

### 2010s

The East Building, inaugurated in 2008 on the Kirchberg plateau was designed
by Ingenhoven Architekten in association with Werner Sobek. It was the first
building in continental Europe to obtain a Bespoke Building Research
Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM) certification of
"very good".

The European Fund for Strategic Investments was launched in 2014 led by the
European Commission and the EIB. Part of the Investment Plan for Europe, it
initially aimed to mobilise €315 billion and was then extended to €500 billion
by 2020. In 2016 the bank launched the Economic Resilience Initiative which
supports regions outside Europe significantly affected by the refugee crisis
through investments supporting growth, jobs, infrastructure and social
cohesion. In 2019 the bank agreed to stop funding fossil fuel projects by the
end of 2021.

### 2020s

In 2020 it announced the 'Climate Bank Roadmap 2021–2025' which will include
stopping funding for all high carbon projects. As part of the European
Guarantee Fund (EGF) to tackle the economic consequences of the COVID-19
pandemic the bank made available €200 billion of additional financing. The
bank is funding both efforts at containing the economic effects of the crisis
as well as healthcare related projects which; address immediate health-related
emergencies, research vaccines and mechanisms to limit the spread of the virus
e.g. testing.

As the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine entered its third year and while the
European Industrial Defence Strategy programme was debated, it became apparent
that EIB "policy" or "its rules explicitly" forbid defence investment. On 18
March 2024 more than half of the member states signed a letter asking the EIB
to reconsider its policy against defence expenditure.

## Controversies

### Projects

Some projects financed or under the appraisal procedure by the EIB have raised
objections from local communities as well as international and national NGOs,
on a variety of grounds including allegations of corruption in awarding
contracts, misallocation of funds, violation of laws, or displacing local
residents. These include the M10 motorway in Russia, the Gazela Bridge in
Serbia, Rača Bridge between Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the D1 motorway
in the Slovakia, Šoštanj Power Plant in Slovenia, the Bujagali Hydroelectric
Power Station in Uganda, the Nenskra Hydropower Plant in Georgia, the Trans
Adriatic Pipeline transporting natural gas from Azerbaijan to Europe starting
from Greece, through Albania to Italy, the Volkswagen emissions scandal also
known as Dieselgate, the Mombasa-Mariakani road project in Kenya, the Olkaria
geothermal development in Kenya, the Vinca incinerator in Belgrade, Serbia.

#### Transparency

The Transparency Policy of the EIB has been criticised by NGOs. In 2004, the
British human rights organisation Article 19 issued a memorandum in which it
accused the EIB of failing to meet international (including EU) standards on
openness. In 2010 the EIB updated its transparency policy following a public
consultation. The latest update of the Transparency Policy in 2015 also
followed a public consultation.

In 2024, EU prosecutors launched a corruption probe into former EIB senior
executives Werner Hoyer and Henry von Blumenthal. The two stand accused of
"corruption, abuse of influence, as well as the misappropriation of EU funds."

### Climate change

A 2011 report by the CEE Bankwatch Network accused the EIB of a lending policy
that failed its responsibility to further the EU goal of cutting carbon
emissions.

In 2019 the bank announced it would cease funding most fossil fuel projects by
the end of 2021, a decision approved by members representing 90% of its
capital. It will only fund energy projects capable of producing one kilowatt
hour of energy for less than 250 grams of carbon dioxide. EIB energy loans
were €21.3 billion in 2023, up from €11.6 billion in 2020, supporting energy
efficiency, renewable energy, innovation, storage, and new energy network
infrastructure.

The 2019 agreement received criticism for its limitations for continuing to
fund carbon-intensive activities including high carbon agriculture, airport
expansions and new conventional energy intensive plants including gas. In
November 2020 the EIB announced the "Climate Bank Roadmap 2021–2025" which
will include stopping funding high carbon projects, including a just
transition mechanism, increasing accountability and accelerating their
timetable for green funding to make more than 50% of annual financing
dedicated to green investment by 2025.

### Tax

In 2014, eleven NGOs demanded the release of an EIB report into allegations of
tax fraud by the Swiss commodity trader Glencore in Zambia related to the
Mopani Copper Mines. Following a recommendation of the European Ombudsman the
EIB released a summary which stated their investigation had been "non-
conclusive". The Ombudsman subsequently called this summary inadequate and
accused the EIB of failing to meet its own transparency policy. In response,
EIB stopped lending to Glencore in 2011 due to concerns about its corporate
governance.

The EIB reviewed its transparency standards applying to control functions by
including a new provision of the EIB Group's Transparency Policy of 2015
allowing the bank to disclose a summary after an investigation has been
closed.

Reports in 2010 and 2015, from a coalition of NGOs, implicated the EIB in tax
avoidance by lending to businesses that use tax havens. The EIB has been
constantly improving its procedures and standards including on governance and
tax matters. This includes the EIB's Environmental and Social Standards, the
Anti-fraud Policy, and the EIB Group Policy towards weakly regulated, non-
transparent and non-cooperative jurisdictions and tax good governance.

### Harassment

In 2021 EIB has been criticised related to its treatment of staff, following
several cases of harassment, bullying and suicide in its premises. The
European Parliament, in its annual report on the EIB in July 2021, referred to
its "serious concerns about allegations regarding harassment and the working
environment" at the EIB. In July 2022, the European Parliament again expressed
"serious concerns about the lack of social dialogue at the EIB, in particular
to address concerns about harassment allegations and the working environment".

## EIB structure

The EIB's departments prepare and implement the decisions of management
bodies. The departments carry out evaluation, appraisal and then finance
projects; assess and manage risks, run economic or financial background
studies and raise financial resources on the capital markets. Article 308 _et
seq._ of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)
establishes the EIB, and the Protocol (No 5) on the Statute of the European
Investment Bank is annexed to the TFEU.

### Governance

The European Investment Bank has three decision-making bodies: the Board of
Governors, the board of directors and the Management Committee. The board of
governors, who are the finance ministers of the European Union member states,
sets the direction of the European Investment Bank. The board of directors
oversees strategic direction. The Management Committee supervises daily
operations.

The European Investment Bank's president chairs the meetings of the management
committee. The members of the management committee are responsible solely to
the bank; they are appointed by the board of governors, on a proposal from the
board of directors, for a renewable period of six years. The president is also
chair of the board of directors.

Internal and independent controls aim to guarantee the integrity and soundness
of European Investment Bank's operations. These include Investigations, Audit
Committee, Compliance, Credit Risk, Financial Control, Internal Control,
Internal Audit, External Auditors, and Operations Evaluation. The bank also
cooperates with independent control bodies: European Court of Auditors, the
European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Ombudsman.

In 2018, seven EU governments demanded improvements in the governance and
structure of the institution as well as stricter cost controls. There were
concerns that EIB had been slow to implement recommendations raised by its own
audit committee, which aimed at improving the risk management and project
selection.

### Accountability

#### Internal control bodies

The EIB has four statutory bodies; the audit committee, the board of
governors, the board of directors and the management committee.

The audit committee functions as an independent control body and verifies the
bank's operations and the validity of its accounts. Its six independent
members are appointed for a non-renewable term of office of six consecutive
financial years by the board of governors. It issues a report on the bank's
financial statements at the time of approval of the financial statements by
the board of directors. The audit committee directly reports to the board of
governors.

The audit committee appoints the external auditors of the EIB and evaluates
their independence and investigates potential conflicts of interest. In recent
years, KPMG has functioned as the EIB's external auditor.

Other internal organisational provisions such as Financial Control or Internal
Audit make recommendations regarding the effectiveness of the bank's
governance, risk management or internal control and express their opinion on
certain aspects of the EIB's financial policies and their implementation.

The EIB Compliance Function is responsible for ensuring that all of the bank's
activities are in line with its standards of integrity. Its tasks include
combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and supporting a
corporate culture that is based on ethical values and professional conduct.

#### External control bodies

The EIB also cooperates with independent control bodies: the European Court of
Auditors, the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the European Ombudsman.
According to Article 287(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU),
the European Court of Auditors has access to information required for the
audit of the European Union's expenditure and revenue managed by the EIB. This
means that the Court of Auditors is authorised to audit loan operations that
are under the mandate conferred by the EU or that are guaranteed by the
general EU budget and administered by the EIB. The bank further collaborates
with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to combat fraud and corruption
within European Institutions. Based on a memorandum of understanding between
the European Investment Bank and the European Ombudsman, EU citizens can
escalate their concerns regarding an EIB project, policy or activity to the
European Ombudsman if the outcome of the EIB's Complaints Mechanism is not
satisfactory.

#### Transparency

Complaints can range from environmental degradation or threats to community
health and safety to involuntary resettlement. The Complaints Mechanism team
examines whether the EIB Group has failed to comply with internal policies,
standards or procedures or with applicable legislation and offers mediation to
solve conflicts between the complainant and an EIB project or activity. It
monitors closed complaints to ensure that agreed measures are implemented.
Improvements to the EIB policy framework that are identified during complaints
processes are given to the senior management.

The EIB's Project Procurements Complaints Committee (PCC) deals with projects
procurement complaints, e.g. objections arising from tendering of EIB-financed
contracts for goods, works and consultant services. The Fraud Investigations
Division investigates allegations, verifies the existence of a robust anti-
fraud policy framework, proactively identifies actual or potential
vulnerabilities and trains staff on fraud awareness.

The bank publishes documents related to its role, governance, accountability,
policies and operations. Project-related information usually include a summary
of the investment project, the loans obtained through financial
intermediaries, environmental and social information, and project briefs. Key
figures and information on the EIB's lending activities are published in the
EIB Activity Reports (yearly figures) and the Statistical Reports (summary
tables). As part of the bank's Transparency policy the EIB does not publish
information that may harm legitimate interests of clients and project
partners. It refuses to disclose, for example, personal data, commercial
interests such as patents, and information related to on-going investigations.
In 2014, the EIB set up a public register to increase transparency and to
allow citizens to browse the bank's publications or to request documents.

#### Communication and outreach

The EIB Complaints Mechanism organises events to inform the general public and
members of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) of the mandate of the mechanism,
the admissibility criteria and the methodological approach. In addition, the
European Investment Bank holds formal public consultations to demonstrate
transparency and accountability and to benefit from the participants'
expertise.
