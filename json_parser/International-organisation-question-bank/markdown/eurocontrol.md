European air traffic organisation

The **European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation** , commonly
known as **Eurocontrol** (stylised _EUROCONTROL_), is an international
organisation working to achieve safe and seamless air traffic management
across Europe. Founded in 1963, Eurocontrol currently has 42 member states
with headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. It has several local sites as well,
including an Innovation Hub in Brétigny-sur-Orge, France, the Aviation
Learning Centre (ALC) in Luxembourg, and the Maastricht Upper Area Control
Centre (MUAC) in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The organisation employs
approximately two thousand people, and operates with an annual budget in
excess of half a billion euros.

Although Eurocontrol is not an agency of the European Union, the EU has
delegated parts of its Single European Sky regulations to Eurocontrol, making
it the central organisation for coordination and planning of air traffic
control for all of Europe. The EU itself is a signatory of Eurocontrol and all
EU member states are presently also members of Eurocontrol. The organisation
works with national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and
military airspace users, airports, and other organisations. Its activities
involve all gate-to-gate air navigation service operations: strategic and
tactical flow management, controller training, regional control of airspace,
safety-proofed technologies and procedures, and collection of air navigation
charges.

The eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in 2010 disrupted air traffic over large
parts of Europe

Eurocontrol takes center stage in managing air traffic disruptions within
Europe to guarantee the continuity of safe and efficient air operations during
crises. For instance, the 2010 Icelandic Volcanic Ash Crisis saw the
involvement of Eurocontrol in providing relevant data to the national
authorities and air traffic control agencies to reduce airspace closure to a
minimum. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Eurocontrol supported the
monitoring of the steep decline in air traffic through strategic responses
toward the adjustment of flight plans and, therefore, mitigating operational
challenges. Much of these efforts are managed through the Network Manager
function of Eurocontrol, which enables the real-time monitoring of air traffic
and oversees the implementation of contingency plans during emergencies such
as natural calamities, industrial strikes, and adverse weather. This would be
the necessary central coordination that sustains the resilience of Europe's
air traffic network during crises.

## History

Headquarters of Eurocontrol in Brussels

The Eurocontrol Convention was signed in 1960 and ratified in 1963. Before the
convention entered into force in 1963, there were already indications that the
matter of national sovereignty would complicate the full implementation of the
organisation's founding mission. The first European plan for a harmonised air
traffic control (ATC) system, proposed in 1962, was beset by the refusal of
both France and Britain to comply, largely due to reasons closely linked with
their national military airspace control. The other four original members (the
Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) agreed
in 1964 to set up a single international air traffic control centre to manage
their upper airspace, settling in the Dutch city of Maastricht.

The European Parliament at the time expressed concern about the lack of clear
intergovernmental agreements to ensure common air traffic control services
across the continent. In 1979, Eurocontrol signed a working cooperation
agreement with the European Commission, attempting to create a synergy of
Eurocontrol's technical expertise and EU's regulatory authorities. Several
initiatives originating in this period become a lasting element of the
organisation, such as the Eurocontrol forecasting service, which became
STATFOR, as well as the Aeronautical Information Service. By 1986, the
pressure on the European ATC network was so big that a new, wider mandate was
already being considered for Eurocontrol, with much of the initiative coming
from ECAC’s Ministers of Transport. Subsequently, ECAC urged all of its member
states to join Eurocontrol.

A meeting of Eurocontrol members

A revised Eurocontrol Convention was signed in 1997, renewing the
organisation's optimism for greater political support, surpassing the original
vision of the 1960 Convention. In June 1998, Eurocontrol, the European Space
Agency (ESA) and the European Commission (EC) also signed an agreement
formalising cooperation in the realm of satellite navigation systems and
services. In 1999 the European Commission presented its plan for a Single
European Sky (SES) to the European Parliament, followed by two high-Level
groups (HLG). The HLG reports on SES led to the establishment of the European
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and reinforced the European Commission's role as
the sole European aviation safety regulator, while acknowledging Eurocontrol's
technical expertise in the implementation of said regulations.

The early 2000s were marred by several fatal accidents in Europe, such as the
2001 Linate Airport runway collision and the 2002 Überlingen mid-air
collision, both of which were related to air traffic navigation shortcomings.
The pressure was further compounded by the September 11 attacks, increasing
the need for a rapid Europe-wide regulatory and coordinating body. By May
2003, Eurocontrol and NATO had signed a memorandum of cooperation, followed by
a similar memorandum with the European Commission in December 2003. In
February 2004, Eurocontrol started work on first mandates from the European
Commission and in April 2004, it adopted the Single European Sky Regulations
(Package 1). In March 2006, the European Commission's Single European Sky ATM
Research (SESAR) Program was launched by the Stakeholder Consultation Group
(SCG) under Eurocontrol's aegis.

## Functions and centres

Eurocontrol provides a set of different services:

  * Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC)
  * Network Manager Operations Centre (NMOC) – coordinates flight plans and actual traffic.
  * EAD – centralised access to AIS information.
  * Central Route Charges Office (CRCO) – collects en-route (and aerodrome approach) charges on behalf of Air Navigation Service providers (ANSPs).
  * Eurocontrol Innovation Hub (EIH)– research, simulations, drones and UAM.
  * EUROCONTROL Aviation Learning Centre (ALC) – training and e-learning.

### Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre

Eurocontrol's Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC), ICAO designator
EDYY, located at Maastricht Aachen Airport, provides air traffic control for
traffic above 24,500 ft over Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and north-
west Germany. In 2017 it became the first multinational, cross-border, civil-
military, air navigation service provider since it integrated the military air
traffic control of the German and Dutch upper airspace.

It is the third busiest upper area area control centre (ACC) in Europe after
the London Area Control Centre and Karlsruhe ACC in terms of traffic numbers,
but the first in terms of flight hours and distance.

MUAC has put in operation innovative technology and productivity enhancements:
a new generation Flight Data Processing System, Integrated Flow Management
Position, the Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA), Controller Pilot Data Link
Communications (CPDLC) and stripless controller working positions.

Typically, air traffic control sectors at MUAC can handle 55 or more flights
per hour. The average flight duration is approximately 21 minutes and
typically 80% of the traffic is climbing from or descending to the major
European airports of London, Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Berlin.
Maastricht UAC has undoubtedly one of the most complex airspace structures in
the world and the traffic flow (up to 5,670 aircraft a day) can be disrupted
by the many surrounding military airspaces.
