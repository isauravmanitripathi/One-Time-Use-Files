1980 environmental treaty

The **Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources** ,
also known as the **Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources** , and**CCAMLR** , is part of the Antarctic Treaty System.

The convention was opened for signature on 1 August 1980 and entered into
force on 7 April 1982 by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic
Marine Living Resources, headquartered in Tasmania, Australia. The goal is to
preserve marine life and environmental integrity in and near Antarctica.

It was established in large part to concerns that an increase in krill catches
in the Southern Ocean could have a serious impact on populations of other
marine life which are dependent upon krill for food.

In 1989, CCAMLR set up the Ecosystem Monitoring Program (CEMP) to further
monitor the effects of fishing and harvesting of species in the area.

On 19 October 2022, Ecuador became a New Member of the Commission, the 26th
member state of the CCAMLR.

## Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)

In 2009, the Commission agreed by consensus to creating a representative
network of MPAs by 2012. It was the first international body to do this based
on recommendations from the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable
Development. In 2011, it identified nine planning domains within which to
designate these protected areas.

Marine Protected Area  | Size  | Status  | Proposed  | Proposed by  | Designated   
---|---|---|---|---|---  
South Orkneys  | 94,000 km2  | Designated  |  | United Kingdom | 2009   
Ross Sea  | 1,550,000 km2  | Designated  | 2012  | New Zealand, United States | 2016

### South Orkneys MPA

In 2009, the Commission agreed by consensus to establish the world's first
high-seas MPA to protect ocean surrounding the South Orkney Islands in the
south Atlantic Ocean.

It was proposed by the United Kingdom and covers 94,000 km2. It came into
force in May 2010.

### Ross Sea MPA

In 2010, a proposal for an MPA in the Ross Sea were put forward by both the US
and New Zealand. These were later combined as a joint proposal.

In July 2013, the Commission held a special meeting in Bremerhaven to consider
proposals for MPAs in both the Ross Sea and East Antarctica. Consensus was not
reached after Russia voted against the proposals, citing uncertainty about
whether the commission had the authority to establish a protected area.

On 28 October 2016, after several years of scientific and diplomatic
discussions, the Commission agreed by consensus to designate the Ross Sea
marine protected area at its annual meeting in Hobart. The protected area
covers 1.55 million square kilometres of ocean, of which 72% is a no-take
zone. The remaining 28% include some harvesting of fish and krill for the
purpose of scientific research.

The Ross Sea MPA will be in force for 35 years. At the end of its review
period in 2052, CCAMLR Members must agree by consensus to renew or modify it
as needed.

### East Antarctic MPA

In 2010, Australia, France and the European Union submitted a proposal for an
MPA in East Antarctica. It originally included seven representative areas with
varying degrees of protection and covered 1.8 million square kilometres of
ocean. By 2017, these were scaled back to three areas covering just under 1
million square kilometres. This was due to the political concerns and economic
interests expressed by some Member states. The proposal was also amended to
include an expiration of 30 years after designation and the ability to review
its monitoring and management every ten years. It has been under consideration
by the Commission since 2012.
