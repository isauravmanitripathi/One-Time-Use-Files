Office of the United Nations Secretariat

The **UN Office for Disarmament Affairs** (abbr. **UNODA** , French: _**Bureau
des affaires du désarmement**_) is an Office of the United Nations Secretariat
established in January 1998 as the **Department for Disarmament Affairs** ,
part of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan to reform the UN as
presented in his report to the General Assembly in July 1997.

Its goal is to promote nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and the
strengthening of the disarmament regimes in respect to other weapons of mass
destruction, chemical and biological weapons. It also promotes disarmament
efforts in the area of conventional weapons, especially landmines and small
arms, which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts.

It is led by an Under-Secretary-General (USG) and High Representative (HR),
Izumi Nakamitsu of Japan, who took office on 1 May 2017.

## History

Izumi Nakamitsu, the United Nations High Representative for Disarmament
Affairs

In its landmark resolution 1653 of 1961, "Declaration on the prohibition of
the use of nuclear and thermo-nuclear weapons", the UN General Assembly stated
that the use of nuclear weaponry "would exceed even the scope of war and cause
indiscriminate suffering and destruction to mankind and civilization and, as
such, is contrary to the rules of international law and to the laws of
humanity".

The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) had originally been
established as a department in 1982 upon the recommendation of the General
Assembly's second special session on disarmament (SSOD II). In 1992, it became
the **Centre for Disarmament Affairs** , working under the Department of
Political Affairs. At the end of 1997, it reverted to being the **Department
for Disarmament Affairs**. Then, in 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon
announced the appointment of Sérgio de Queiroz Duarte of Brazil as the High
Representative for Disarmament Affairs at the Under-Secretary-General (USG)
level and the department became the United Nations Office for Disarmament
Affairs. Following the retirement of Sérgio Duarte in February 2012, Angela
Kane, then USG for Management, was appointed as the new High Representative
for Disarmament Affairs. She was the first woman and first non diplomat
appointed to this position.

## Mission

UNODA provides substantive and organizational support for norm-setting in the
area of disarmament through the work of the UN General Assembly and its First
Committee, the Disarmament Commission, the Conference on Disarmament and other
bodies. It fosters preventive disarmament measures, such as dialogue,
transparency and confidence-building on military matters, and encourages
regional disarmament efforts. The latter includes the UN Register of
Conventional Arms and regional forums. It also provides information on the
United Nations disarmament efforts.

UNODA supports the development and implementation of practical disarmament
measures after a conflict, such as disarming and demobilizing former
combatants and helping them to reintegrate in civil society.

## Structure

The United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs comprises five branches:
Conference on Disarmament Secretariat and Conference Support Branch (Geneva),
Weapons of Mass Destruction Branch (WMD), Conventional Arms (including
Practical Disarmament) Branch (CAB), the Information and Outreach Branch (IOB)
and, Regional Disarmament Branch (RDB). RDB further manages three regional
centers.

Branches and centers are organized as follows:

## Activities

### Conference on Disarmament Secretariat and Conference Support Branch

The Conference on Disarmament Secretariat and Conference Support Branch, based
in Geneva, provides organizational and substantive servicing to the Conference
on Disarmament (CD), the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of
the international community.

### Weapons of Mass Destruction Branch

The WMD Branch provides substantive support in the area of the disarmament of
weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical and biological weapons). It
supports and participates in multilateral efforts to strengthen the non-
proliferation of WMD and in this connection cooperates with the relevant
intergovernmental organizations and specialized agencies of the United Nations
system, in particular the IAEA, the OPCW and the CTBTO PrepCom.

### Conventional Arms (including Practical Disarmament Measures) Branch

The CAB focuses its efforts in the conventional field (all weapons not
considered WMDs, including small arms and light weapons) of promoting
transparency and confidence-building, curbing the flow of small arms in
regions of tension, and developing measures of practical disarmament. It is
responsible for substantive conference support on the UN Programme of Action
on small arms, the Arms Trade Treaty process, and the UN transparency
registers. CAB chairs the UN-internal coordination mechanism on small arms,
CASA.

### Information and Outreach Branch

The IO Branch organizes a wide variety of special events and programmes in the
field of disarmament, produces ODA publications such as the Disarmament
Yearbook and occasional papers, and maintains the databases for specialized
areas such as Register of Conventional Arms, Status of Treaties and Article 7
- Mine-Ban Convention.

### Regional Disarmament Branch

The Regional Disarmament Branch (RDB) provides substantive support, including
advisory services, to Member States, regional and subregional organizations on
disarmament measures and related security matters.

RDB oversees and coordinates the activities of the three regional centres:

    \- UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa (UNREC)
    \- UN Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific (UNRCPD)
    \- UN Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNLIREC)
