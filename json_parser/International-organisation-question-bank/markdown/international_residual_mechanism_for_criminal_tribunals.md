International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals building in Arusha,
Tanzania

The **International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals** (**IRMCT**) or
the **MICT** in Kinyarwanda, also known simply as the **Mechanism** , is an
international court established by the United Nations Security Council in 2010
to perform the remaining functions of the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for
Rwanda (ICTR) following the completion of those tribunals' respective
mandates. It is based in both Arusha, Tanzania and The Hague, Netherlands.

## Background

In the early 1990s, the United Nations Security Council established two
criminal courts whose purpose was to investigate and prosecute individuals
responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The first
of these courts was the International Criminal Tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia (ICTY), which was established in 1993 to investigate crimes
committed during the Yugoslav Wars. The second court, the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), was established the following year to
address crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. Both the ICTY and the
ICTR were meant to be temporary institutions that would conclude after their
mandate to investigate crimes and prosecute individuals was completed.
Although both tribunals have completed substantially all of their mandates,
there are residual functions that will not be accomplished for many more
years. For example, future trials may be held once remaining ICTR fugitives
are captured, convicted persons may still petition for early release,
protective orders for witnesses may need to be modified, and the archives that
contain confidential documents need to be safeguarded. In order to oversee the
residual functions of the ICTY and ICTR in an efficient manner, the Security
Council passed Resolution 1966 on 22 December 2010, which created the
Mechanism.

## Mandate

In Resolution 1966, the Security Council decided that "the Mechanism shall
continue the jurisdiction, rights and obligations and essential functions of
the ICTY and the ICTR." The Security Council further envisioned that the
Mechanism would be "a small, temporary and efficient structure, whose
functions and size will diminish over time, with a small number of staff
commensurate with its reduced functions." The Mechanism will continue to
operate until the Security Council decides otherwise, however it will be
subject to a two-year review beginning in 2016.

The Mechanism comprises two branches. One branch covers functions inherited
from the ICTR and is located in Arusha, Tanzania. It commenced functioning on
1 July 2012. The other branch is located in The Hague, Netherlands and began
operating on 1 July 2013. During the initial period of the Mechanism's work,
there was a temporal overlap with the ICTR and the ICTY as these institutions
complete outstanding work on any trial or appeal proceedings which are pending
as of the commencement dates of the respective branches of the Mechanism.

## Fugitives

The tracking, arrest and prosecution of the remaining fugitives still wanted
for trial by the ICTR was a top priority for the Mechanism for International
Criminal Tribunals, and was carried out by the OTP Fugitive Tracking Team

With the arrest and transfer in 2011 of the last two fugitives for the ICTY,
Ratko Mladić and Goran Hadžić, what was originally envisaged as a function of
the Mechanism – trial of the ICTY’s remaining fugitives - was completed by the
ICTY.

Under Article 6(3) of its Statute, the Mechanism shall only retain
jurisdiction over those individuals considered to be the most responsible for
committing the gravest crimes. In accordance with this Article, the ICTR
Prosecutor requested referrals to Rwanda in the cases of the last two
fugitives: Charles Sikubwabo and Charles Ryandikayo, later declared dead on
May 15, 2024. With these deaths, the IRMCT announced that all ICTR fugitives
had been successfully accounted for.

Over 1000 Génocidaire fugitives are sought by national authorities and the
IRMCT continues to assist in the tracking of these fugitives.

Judges of the IRMCT (2019)

The judges of the Mechanism are elected by the General Assembly from a roster
prepared by the Security Council following nominations from member states of
the United Nations. Judges serve for a term of four years and can be
reappointed by the Secretary-General with the consultation of the Presidents
of the Security Council and of the General Assembly. The Judges are present at
the Mechanism only when necessary and at the request of the President. As much
as possible, the Judges carry out their functions remotely.
