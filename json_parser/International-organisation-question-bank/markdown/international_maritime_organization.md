Specialized agency of the United Nations

The **International Maritime Organization** (**IMO** ; French: _Organisation
maritime internationale_ ; Spanish: _Organización Marítima Internacional_) is
a specialized agency of the United Nations regulating maritime transport. It
was established following agreement at a UN conference held in Geneva in 1948,
but this did not come into force for ten years, and the new body, then called
the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, first assembled on
6 January 1959. Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the IMO has 176
Member States and three Associate Members as of 2025.

The IMO's purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory
framework for shipping and its remit includes maritime safety, environmental
concerns, and legal matters. IMO is governed by an assembly of members which
meets every two years. Its finance and organization is administered by a
council of 40 members elected from the assembly. The work of IMO is conducted
through five committees supported by technical subcommittees. Other UN
organizations may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status is
granted to qualified NGOs.

IMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are
representative of the organization's members. The secretariat is composed of a
Secretary-General elected by the assembly, and various divisions such as those
for marine safety, environmental protection and a conference section.

## History

Opening and anniversary plaques of Queen Elizabeth II and model of _Queen Mary
2_ in the lobby of the IMO Headquarters

In February–March 1948 the United Nations Maritime Conference in Geneva
institutionalized the regulation of the safety of shipping into an
international framework. Hitherto such international conventions had been
initiated piecemeal, notably the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS),
adopted in 1914 following the _Titanic_ disaster. The conference resolved
"that an international organization to be known as the Intergovernmental
Maritime Consultative Organization shall be established"; however many
countries did not trust the convention, so ratification was slow and it took
until March 1958 until it came into force.

The _Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization_ (IMCO; now using
the hyphen) held its first Assembly in London in January 1959. Its initial
task was to update the SOLAS; the resulting 1960 International Convention for
the Safety of Life at Sea was recast in 1974 and subsequently modified and
updated to adapt to changes in safety requirements and technology. Since 1978,
every last Thursday of September has been celebrated as World Maritime Day.

When IMCO began its operations in 1959 certain other pre-existing conventions
were brought under its aegis, most notably the International Convention for
the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil (OILPOL) from 1954. Under the
guidance of IMCO, the convention was amended in 1962, 1969, and 1971.

Oil spill on a beach

As oil trade and industry developed, many people in the industry saw a need
for further improvements in regards to pollution prevention. This became
increasingly apparent in 1967, when the tanker _Torrey Canyon_ ran aground
entering the English Channel and spilled record-breaking 120,000 tons of crude
oil. This incident prompted a series of new conventions.

IMO held an emergency session of its council to deal with the need to
readdress regulations pertaining to maritime pollution. In 1969, the IMO
Assembly decided to host an international gathering in 1973 dedicated to this
issue. The goal was to develop an international agreement for controlling
general environmental contamination by ships when out at sea. During the next
few years IMO brought to the forefront a series of measures designed to
prevent large ship accidents and to minimize their effects. It also detailed
how to deal with the environmental threat caused by routine ship duties such
as the cleaning of oil cargo tanks or the disposal of engine room wastes. By
tonnage, the aforementioned was a bigger problem than accidental pollution.
The most significant development to come out of this conference was the
International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973
(MARPOL). It covers not only accidental and operational oil pollution but also
different types of pollution by chemicals, goods in packaged form, sewage,
garbage and air pollution. The original MARPOL was signed on 17 February 1973,
but did not come into force due to lack of ratifications. The current
convention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the 1978 Protocol. It
entered into force on 2 October 1983. As of January 2018, 156 states,
representing 99.42 per cent of the world's shipping tonnage, are signatories
to the MARPOL convention.[_needs update_]

As well as updates to MARPOL and SOLAS, the IMO facilitated several updated
international maritime conventions, including the International Convention on
Load Lines in 1966 (replacing an earlier 1930 Convention), the International
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea in 1972 (also replacing an
earlier set of rules) and the STCW Convention in 1978. In 1975, the assembly
of the IMO decided that future conventions of the International Convention for
the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and other IMO instruments should use SI
units. Sea transportation is one of few industrial areas that still commonly
uses non-metric units such as the nautical mile (nmi) for distance and knots
(kn) for speed or velocity.

In November 1975, the IMCO Assembly, as a part of comprehensive review of the
Convention, decided to rename it as the _International Maritime Organization_
(IMO); after ratifications, this happened in May 1982. Throughout its
existence, the IMO has continued to produce new and updated conventions across
a wide range of maritime issues covering not only safety of life and marine
pollution but also encompassing safe navigation, search and rescue, wreck
removal, tonnage measurement, liability and compensation, ship recycling, the
training and certification of seafarers, and piracy. More recently SOLAS has
been amended to bring an increased focus on maritime security through the
International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. The IMO has also
increased its focus on smoke emissions from ships. In 1983, the IMO
established the World Maritime University in Malmö, Sweden and also
facilitated the adoption of the IGC Code. In 1991, the IMO facilitated the
adoption of the International Grain Code.

In December 2002, new amendments to the 1974 SOLAS Convention were enacted by
the IMO. These gave rise to the International Ship and Port Facility Security
(ISPS) Code, which went into effect on 1 July 2004. The concept of the code is
to provide layered and redundant defences against smuggling, terrorism,
piracy, stowaways, etc. The ISPS Code required most ships and port facilities
engaged in international trade to establish and maintain strict security
procedures as specified in ship and port specific Ship Security Plans and Port
Facility Security Plans.

## Headquarters

IMO building from across Thames

The IMO headquarters is a large purpose-built building facing the River Thames
on the Albert Embankment, in Lambeth, London. The organization moved into its
new headquarters in late 1982, with the building being officially opened by
Queen Elizabeth II on 17 May 1983. The architects of the building were
Douglass Marriott, Worby & Robinson. The front of the building is dominated by
a seven-metre high, ten-tonne bronze sculpture of the bow of a ship, with a
lone seafarer maintaining a look-out. The previous headquarters of IMO were at
101 Piccadilly (now the home of the Embassy of Japan), prior to that at 22
Berners Street in Fitzrovia and originally in Chancery Lane.

## Structure

The IMO consists of an Assembly, a Council and five main Committees. The
organization is led by a Secretary-General. A number of Sub-Committees support
the work of the main technical committees.

### Governance of IMO

The governing body of the International Maritime Organization is the Assembly
which meets every two years. In between Assembly sessions a Council,
consisting of 40 Member States elected by the Assembly, acts as the governing
body. The technical work of the International Maritime Organization is carried
out by a series of Committees. The Secretariat consists of some 300
international civil servants headed by a Secretary-General.

The Secretary-General Arsenio Dominguez took office for a four year term on 1
January 2024, having been elected in July 2023. The previous Secretary-General
was Kitack Lim from South Korea elected for a four-year term at the 114th
session of the IMO Council in June 2015 and at the 29th session of the IMO's
Assembly in November 2015. His mandate started on 1 January 2016. At the 31st
session of the Assembly in 2019 he was re-appointed for a second term, ending
on 31 December 2023.

### Technical committees

IMO's main hall assembly chamber, where the MSC and MEPC committees meet each
year

The technical work of the International Maritime Organization is carried out
by five principal Committees:

  * The Maritime Safety Committee (MSC)
  * The Marine environment Protection Committee (MEPC)
  * The Legal Committee
  * The Technical Cooperation Committee, for capacity building
  * The Facilitation Committee, to simplify the documentation and formalities required in international shipping. The Committees meet once or twice a year attended by Member States and NGOs.

#### Maritime Safety Committee

It is regulated in the Article 28(a) of the Convention on the IMO:

> ARTICLE 28
>
> (a) The Maritime Safety Committee shall consider any matter within the scope
> of the Organization concerned with aids to navigation, construction and
> equipment of vessels, manning from a safety standpoint, rules for the
> prevention of collisions, handling of dangerous cargoes, maritime safety
> procedures and requirements, hydrographic information, log-books and
> navigational records, marine casualty investigation, salvage and rescue, and
> any other matters directly affecting maritime safety.
>
> (b) The Maritime Safety Committee shall provide machinery for performing any
> duties assigned to it by this Convention, the Assembly or the Council, or
> any duty within the scope of this Article which may be assigned to it by or
> under any other international instrument and accepted by the Organization.
>
> (c) Having regard to the provisions of Article 25, the Maritime Safety
> Committee, upon request by the Assembly or the Council or, if it deems such
> action useful in the interests of its own work, shall maintain such close
> relationship with other bodies as may further the purposes of the
> Organization

The main Plenary Hall of the IMO, where the Maritime Safety Committee meets

The Maritime Safety Committee is the most senior of these and is the main
Technical Committee; it oversees the work of its nine sub-committees and
initiates new topics. One broad topic it deals with is the effect of the human
element on casualties; this work has been put to all of the sub-committees,
but meanwhile, the Maritime Safety Committee has developed a code for the
management of ships which will ensure that agreed operational procedures are
in place and followed by the ship and shore-side staff.

#### Sub-Committees

The MSC and MEPC are assisted in their work by a number of sub-committees
which are open to all Member States. The committees are:

  * Sub-Committee on Human Element, Training and Watchkeeping (HTW)
  * Sub-Committee on Implementation of IMO Instruments (III)
  * Sub-Committee on Navigation, Communications and Search and Rescue (NCSR)
  * Sub-Committee on Pollution Prevention and Response (PPR)
  * Sub-Committee on Ship Design and Construction (SDC)
  * Sub-Committee on Ship Systems and Equipment (SSE)
  * Sub-Committee on Carriage of Cargoes and Containers (CCC).

The names of the IMO sub-committees were changed in 2013. Prior to 2013 there
were nine Sub-Committees as follows:

  * Bulk Liquids and Gases (BLG)
  * Carriage of Dangerous Goods, Solid Cargoes and Containers(DSC)
  * Fire Protection (FP)
  * Radio-communications and Search and Rescue (COMSAR)
  * Safety of Navigation (NAV)
  * Ship Design and Equipment (DE)
  * Stability and Load Lines and Fishing Vessels Safety (SLF)
  * Standards of Training and Watchkeeping (STW)
  * Flag State Implementation (FSI)

## Membership

Flags on the IMO building

To join the IMO, a state ratifies a multilateral **Convention on the
International Maritime Organization**. As of 2025, there are 176 member states
of the IMO, which includes 175 of the UN member states plus the Cook Islands.
The first state to ratify the convention was Canada in October 1948, but it
took until March 1958 when Egypt and Japan brought the number of parties to
21, required by the Convention.

In 1961, the territories of Sabah and Sarawak, which had been included through
the participation of United Kingdom, became joint associate members; in 1963
they became part of Malaysia.

The most recent new members are Armenia (landlocked, January 2018), Nauru (May
2018), Botswana (landlocked, October 2021) and, on 27 February 2024,
landlocked Kyrgyzstan became the 176th Member State of the organization.

Most UN member states that are not members of IMO are landlocked countries.
These include Afghanistan, Andorra, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Central
African Republic, Chad, Eswatini, Laos, Lesotho, Liechtenstein, Mali, Niger,
Rwanda, South Sudan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The Federated States of
Micronesia, an island-nation in the Pacific Ocean, is also a non-member.
Taiwan, as Republic of China, was a member of the IMCO from 1958 until UN
changed its recognition to People's Republic of China in 1971; its later
attempts to join IMO were blocked, although it has a major shipping industry.

IMO is the source of approximately 60 legal instruments that guide the
regulatory development of its member states to improve safety at sea,
facilitate trade among seafaring states and protect the maritime environment.
The most well known is the International Convention for the Safety of Life at
Sea (SOLAS), as well as International Convention for the Prevention of
Pollution from Ships (MARPOL). Others include the International Oil Pollution
Compensation Funds (IOPC). It also functions as a depository of yet to be
ratified treaties, such as the International Convention on Liability and
Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and
Noxious Substances by Sea, 1996 (HNS Convention) and Nairobi International
Convention of Removal of Wrecks (2007).

IMO regularly enacts regulations, which are broadly enforced by national and
local maritime authorities in member countries, such as the International
Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREG). The IMO has also
enacted a Port state control (PSC) authority, allowing domestic maritime
authorities such as coast guards to inspect foreign-flag ships calling at
ports of the many port states. Memoranda of Understanding (protocols) were
signed by some countries unifying Port State Control procedures among the
signatories.

## Current priorities

Recent initiatives at the IMO have included amendments to SOLAS, which among
other things, included upgraded fire protection standards on passenger ships,
the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and
Watchkeeping for Seamen (STCW) which establishes basic requirements on
training, certification and watchkeeping for seafarers and to the Convention
on the Prevention of Maritime Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), which required double
hulls on all tankers.

The IMO's e-Navigation system has harmonized marine navigation systems with
supporting shore services, as available to seamen and shore-side traffic
services called. An e-Navigation strategy was ratified in 2005, and an
implementation plan was developed through three IMO sub-committees. The plan
was completed by 2014 and implemented in November of that year. IMO has also
served as a key partner and enabler of US international and interagency
efforts to establish maritime domain awareness.[_citation needed_]

### Environmental issues

The IMO has a role in tackling international climate change. The First
Intersessional Meeting of IMO's Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from
Ships took place in Oslo, Norway (23–27 June 2008), tasked with developing the
technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future
IMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping,
and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further
consideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). The IMO
participated in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris
seeking to establish itself as the "appropriate international body to address
greenhouse gas emissions from ships engaged in international trade".
Nonetheless, there has been widespread criticism of the IMO's relative
inaction since the conclusion of the Paris conference, with the initial data-
gathering step of a three-stage process to reduce maritime greenhouse
emissions expected to last until 2020. In 2018, the Initial IMO Strategy on
the reduction of GHG emissions from ships was adopted. In 2021, _The New York
Times_ wrote that the IMO "has repeatedly delayed and watered down climate
regulations".

The IMO has also taken action to mitigate the global effects of ballast water
and sediment discharge, through the 2004 Ballast Water Management Convention,
which entered into force in September 2017.

In December 2023 the IMO adopted a resolution targeting "dark fleet" tankers
that form a risk by undertaking illegal and unsafe activities at sea.
Primarily working for Iran and Russia to breach international sanctions, the
tankers, many of which are elderly and unreliable, often undertake mid ocean
transfers in an attempt to evade sanctions. The resolution calls upon flag
states to “adhere to measures which lawfully prohibit or regulate” the
transfer of cargoes at sea, known as ship-to-ship transfers.

In April 2025, the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)
approved net-zero regulations for the global shipping industry to reach net-

The IMO Cape Town Agreement is an international International Maritime
Organization legal instrument established in 2012, that sets out minimum
safety requirements for fishing vessels of 24 metres in length and over or
equivalent in gross tons. As of 2022, the Agreement is not yet in force but
the IMO is encouraging more member States to ratify the Agreement.
