International transportation cooperation organisation

**TRACECA** (acronym: **Tra** nsport **C** orridor **E** urope-**C**
aucasus-**A** sia) is an international transport programme involving 14
countries from the European Union, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, and Central
Asia. The programme aim is to strengthen economic relations, trade, and
transport in the regions of the Black Sea basin, the South Caucasus, and
Central Asia. It has a permanent Secretariat, originally financed by the
European Commission, in Baku, Azerbaijan, and a regional office in Odesa,
Ukraine.

## Origins

TRACECA was established in May 1993 in Brussels, upon the signing of a
Multilateral Agreement on International Transport for the development of
transport initiatives (including the establishment and development of a road
corridor) between EU member states, Eastern European, Caucasus and Central
Asian countries. The programme supports the political and economic
independence of former Soviet Union republics through enhancing their access
to European and global markets through road, rail and sea. The objectives of
TRACECA were underlined by the Baku Initiative of 2004, followed by a further
ministerial conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 2006.
