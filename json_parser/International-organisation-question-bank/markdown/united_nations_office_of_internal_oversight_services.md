UN office in the United Nations Secretariat

The **United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services** (**OIOS**) is an
independent office in the United Nations Secretariat whose mandate is to
"assist the Secretary-General in fulfilling his internal oversight
responsibilities in respect of the resources and staff of the Organization."
Specifically, activities include internal audit, investigation, monitoring,
evaluation, inspection, reporting and support services to the United Nations
Secretariat.

Its intended and mandated function is similar to many national government
audit organisations, like the Government Accountability Office in the United
States. It reports not only to the General Assembly, but also to the
Secretary-General.

The current head of the OIOS, Under-Secretary-General Fatoumata Ndiaye of
Senegal, was appointed as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight
Services for a five-year term starting on 17 October 2019,[_needs update_]
succeeding Heidi Mendoza of the Philippines.

The office was established in 1994 at the insistence of the United States that
the UN take steps to curb waste and corruption, although there are some doubts
concerning its effectiveness. Its first head was Under-Secretary-General Karl
Theodor Paschke.
