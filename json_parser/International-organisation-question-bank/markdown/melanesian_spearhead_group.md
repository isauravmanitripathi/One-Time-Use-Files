The **Melanesian Spearhead Group** (**MSG**) is an intergovernmental
organization, composed of the four Melanesian states of Fiji, Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, and the Kanak and Socialist National
Liberation Front of New Caledonia. In June 2015, Indonesia was recognized as
an associate member.

It was founded as a political gathering in 1986. On 23 March 2007, members
signed the _Agreement Establishing the Melanesian Spearhead Group_ ,
formalizing the group under international law. It is headquartered in Port
Vila, Vanuatu. A secretariat building was constructed by the People's Republic
of China and handed over to the MSG in November 2007. The first Director
General of the MSG Secretariat was Rima Ravusiro of Papua New Guinea. Since
April 2016, Amena Yauvoli of Fiji heads the MSG Secretariat.

## Purpose

Melanesian Spearhead Group was formed with focus to promote economic growth
among Melanesian countries. The purposes of the group are:

  1. To promote and strengthen inter membership trade, exchange of Melanesian cultures, traditions, values and sovereign equality;
  2. To foster economic and technical cooperation between the members; and
  3. To align member countries' policies and further members' shared goals of economical growth, sustainable development, good governance and security.

One of the key features of the MSG is the _Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade
Agreement_ , a sub-regional preferential trade agreement established to foster
and accelerate economic development through trade relations and provide a
political framework for regular consultations and review on the status of the
Agreement, with a view to ensuring that trade both in terms of exports and
imports is undertaken in a genuine spirit of Melanesian Solidarity and is done
on a most favoured nation (MFN) basis. Negotiations are held regularly between
the members' leaders to consider the progress and developments of the
agreement. After a revision in 2005, it covers 180 articles free of fiscal
duty.

## History

### Formation

The Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) was conceived in 1986 between the three
Melanesian Pacific Island Countries namely Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu and
Solomon Islands. The MSG Trade Agreement was signed in 1993 by Papua New
Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. At the 6th Melanesian Spearhead Group
(MSG) Trade and Economic Officials’ Meeting on 16 April 1997 in Honiara, the
Fiji delegation indicated its willingness to accede to it. This initiative was
endorsed at the 1997 MSG Leaders Summit. Fiji became a formal member of the
MSG Trade Agreement on 14 April 1998. The 9th MSG Trade & Economic Officials
meeting was held in Papua New Guinea on 29 and 30 November 2000. This meeting
saw the acceptance of the expansion of the MSG Product Schedule tariff
headings from four to six digits, thereby facilitating MSG trade by removing
the ambiguity in product identification at Customs points of entry. The
agreement is General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) consistent and has
been approved and accorded recognition by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
Committee on Regional Arrangements to be compatible and meeting the
requirements of Article 24 of the GATT/WTO Agreement.

The Melanesian Spearhead Group Secretariat was established in May 2008 after
years of operating on an ad-hoc basic. The opening of a permanent office in
Port Vila, Vanuatu, signaled a new phase for the MSG group as it ventured into
organizing and managing its affairs in a more structured manner.

### Politics

More recently, the Melanesian Spearhead Group got heavily involved in the
political discussions following Fiji's suspension from the Pacific Islands
Forum in May 2009.

In July 2010, Fiji expelled Australia's acting high commissioner accusing the
latter of causing the postponement of a so-called _Engaging Fiji_ meeting.
Australia responded that it had to do with the lack of democracy in the
country. An alternate meeting was held instead despite pressure from Australia
and New Zealand. It was attended by Prime Minister Michael Somare of Papua New
Guinea, Prime Minister Derek Sikua of the Solomon Islands, President Anote
Tong of Kiribati, Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia of Tuvalu, and Prime Minister
Frank Bainimarama of Fiji.

Melanesian Spearhead Group is also involved in the issue of Papua, which
involves the Indonesian government and a West Papuan separatist movement.
Melanesian Spearhead Group's role in raising the international profile of New
Caledonia's Kanak independence movement, has prompted West Papuan Independence
activists to recognise the significance of its membership. The West Papua
National Council for Liberation (WPNCL) hopes to use Melanesian Spearhead
Group as an international platform to fight for independence.

Indonesia, however, also applied for MSG membership in 2010, arguing that
Indonesia is home to 11 million Melanesians mainly residing in 5 provinces in
Eastern Indonesia; Papua, West Papua, Maluku, North Maluku and East Nusa
Tenggara. Indonesia won observer status in 2011 with the support of Fiji and
Papua New Guinea. East Timor was granted observer status in 2011.

In May 2013, Buchtar Tabuni, the leader of the National Committee for West
Papua (KNPB) supported the notion that if West Papua was granted independence,
he would support them joining the MSG. The WPNCL submitted an unsuccessful
application to the MSG in October 2013. The MSG advised that West Papua
independence organizations must first unite for any future applications to be
considered.

The United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) was formed in December
2014. A second application of West Papua independence movement has been
submitted in 2015 by the ULMWP, led by spokesperson Benny Wenda.

### Expansion

In 24 to 26 June 2015, the summit meeting of the member countries in Honiara,
Solomon Islands concluded with key decisions; Indonesia was elevated to
associate member of the group — making them the official representative of
West Papua region, while the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP)
remained as an observer. The ULMWP was considered only as the representative
of West Papuans outside the country.

Despite being denied of full membership, ULMWP secretary-general Octavianus
Mote regarded the observer status positively, saying the diplomatic
recognition would help them in their cause. "We might not be a full member of
the MSG, but a door has opened to us. We will sit across a table from
Indonesia as equal," he said.

However, Indonesia's membership of the MSG has giving them a greater influence
in Melanesian politics than the ULMWP. In MSG, Indonesia's official
representation will be the governors of Indonesia's five Melanesian provinces.
Fijian prime minister Frank Bainimarama, who supported Indonesian membership,
argued that his vote was guided by a number of main principles in approaching
the West Papuan issue. "Indonesian sovereignty over West Papua cannot be
questioned, and the province is an integral part of Indonesia, so when we deal
with West Papua and its people, MSG has no choice but to deal with Indonesia,
in a positive and constructive manner," he said. Following the decision of
elevating Indonesia to associate member, the government of Indonesia, for the
first time, hosted the Melanesian Cultural Festival 2015 in Kupang, East Nusa
Tenggara from 26 to 30 October 2015, which is aimed at improving cooperation
among Melanesian countries. The festival was participated by all members of
MSG except Vanuatu, and also Timor Leste.

In 2024, Ishmael Toroama, president of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville
in Papua New Guinea, announced that his government intended to apply for
observer status with the MSG, as one of its first steps in developing foreign
affairs activities in advance of its planned independence in 2027.
