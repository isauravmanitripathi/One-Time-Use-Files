Eurasian intergovernmental organization

The **Organization of Turkic States** (**OTS**), formerly called the **Turkic
Council** or the **Cooperation Council of Turkic Speaking States** , is an
intergovernmental organization comprising all but one of the internationally
recognized Turkic sovereign states: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Turkey, and Uzbekistan; while Hungary, Turkmenistan and Northern Cyprus are
observers. Its overarching aim is promoting comprehensive cooperation among
the Turkic peoples. First proposed by Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev in
2006, it was founded on 3 October 2009 in Azerbaijan's Nakhchivan. The General
Secretariat is located in Turkey's Istanbul.

In addition to Turkmenistan, the organization has also admitted Hungary and
the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as observers, although the latter is
only recognized by Turkey.

During the 8th summit in Istanbul in 2021, the organization was restructured
and adopted its current name.

## History

The organization was established on 3 October 2009 as the Cooperation Council
of the Turkic Speaking States (Turkic Council), by the Nakhchivan Agreement
signed among Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey. According to
Halil Akıncı, the founding Secretary-General of the organization, the Turkic
Council became the first voluntary alliance of Turkic states in history.

In 2012, the flag of the Turkic Council was adopted at its 2nd Summit, which
took place in Bishkek on 23 August 2012 and officially raised on 12 October
2012. The flag combines the symbols of the four founding member states: the
light blue color of the flag of Kazakhstan which also evokes the traditional
Turkic color of turquoise, the sun of the flag of Kyrgyzstan, the star of the
flag of Azerbaijan and the crescent of the Turkish flag.

On 30 April 2018, it was announced that Uzbekistan would join the Cooperation
Council of Turkic-Speaking States and attend the upcoming summit of the
organization in Bishkek. It formally applied for membership on 12 September
2019.

Since late 2018, Hungary has been an observer and may request full membership.
Turkmenistan received observer status in 2021.

In November 2021, the organization was renamed the Organization of Turkic
States.

Initiated by President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the Extraordinary Summit
of the Heads of State of the Organization of Turkic States in Ankara in March
2023 highlights Azerbaijan's integral role within the expanding United Turkic
World.

The member states' increased focus on mutual security and strategic alignment
marks a significant shift in regional dynamics, positioning the OTS as a
central player in shaping the security architecture of the Turkic world.

Of great importance is the comprehensive structure of the Union of
Municipalities of the Turkic World, in which local governments from 30
countries and regions are represented. 10 June 2022 6th Congress of the Union
of Municipalities of the Turkic World.

In 2022, the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was admitted to the
organization as an observer member.

In September 2024 it was reported that the Commission on the Common Alphabet
of the Turkic World, which is an arm of the OTS, had agreed on a common
alphabet of 34 letters based on the Latin alphabet in an effort to transition
away from the Cyrillic which had been imposed when under Soviet rule. TURKPA
member Professor Nizami Jafarov of Baku State University made the
announcement. The project for a common Turkic alphabet based on Latin was
first proposed in 1991 after the dissolution of the USSR.

## Projects

Since its founding agreement defines comprehensive cooperation among Turkic
states as the organization's main objective and raison d'être, the
Organization of Turkic States is working on a variety of projects. The
projects are grouped under six cooperation processes, which are: economy,
culture, education, transport, customs, and diaspora. Examples of the projects
include establishing the Turkic University Union and writing a common history
textbook. The Organization of Turkic States also works on ways to boost
economic development in underdeveloped regions of Member States. The
Secretariat brings together Economy Ministers, Education Ministers, Transport
Ministers, Heads of Customs Administrations, and other senior officials from
different ministries and agencies in order to work on ways to promote
cooperation in relevant spheres. Prior to being brought before ministers and
heads of administrations, projects and issues of cooperation are elaborated by
working groups. One recently launched project is the establishment of a
mechanism for closer cooperation among Turkic diasporas all over the world.

relations, they have to establish a joint investment fund and build its center
on Kyrgyzstan on his meeting with Turkish Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu. Baghdad
Amreyev visited Minister of Treasury and Finance of Turkey Lütfi Elvan and

about a Turkic Joint Investment Fund feasibility work and agreement to
establish the fund.

In September 2022, on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of the Language
Festival, the Organization of Turkic States decided to establish a "Common
Alphabet Commission" within the body of OTS for a unified alphabet of the
Turkic world. During the event, scientists from the Turkic states gave
information about the alphabets and historical processes used in their own
countries, and thus it was emphasized that the transition processes to the
common alphabet should be accelerated, and the application should be
widespread. The commission, which will hold its first meeting in Kyrgyzstan,
will observe the work of the common alphabet and report to the Council of
Elders.
