United Nations regional group

WEOG member and observer states

The **Group of Western European and Other States** , also known as the
**Western European and Other States Group** or **WEOG** , is one of the five
United Nations regional groups. It is composed of 28 member states. Most of
these are in Western Europe, but the group also includes Australia, Canada,
Israel, New Zealand, and Turkey. The United States and Holy See (Vatican City)
participate as observers.

The Group is a non-binding dialogue group where subjects concerning regional
and international matters are discussed. Additionally, the Group works to help
allocate seats on United Nations bodies by nominating candidates from the
region.

Unlike most other Regional Groups, WEOG is unusual in that geography is not
the sole defining factor of its membership. Instead, its membership is based
on geopolitical breakdown, being part of the "Western world" of affluent,
developed liberal democracies, and are either part of Western Europe or a
majority European-descended state (except Turkey and Israel), and part of the
NATO military alliance and/or the US-led western military-economic community.

### Israel

While geographically located in Asia, Israel has been blocked from joining the
Asia-Pacific Group by various Arab states[_citation needed_]. Due to having no
regional group, Israel was unable to participate in the political and
professional consultations within the framework of the United Nations and its
agencies between its admission in 1949 and 1999. It was also unable to have
its representatives elected to United Nations institutions due to the fact
that it was not part of any regional group. In 1964, Israel applied to join
WEOG and was rejected.

This changed in May 2000, when Israel became a temporary member of the WEOG at
the United Nations in New York, allowing it to put forward candidates for
election to various United Nations General Assembly bodies. However, this
temporary membership still precluded Israel from participating in activities
at United Nations offices in Geneva, Nairobi, Rome and Vienna.

On 30 April 2004, the United States House of Representatives passed a
resolution calling for the full inclusion of Israel in WEOG, directing the
U.S. Government to pursue action to "ensure the extension and upgrade of
Israel's membership in the Western European and Others Group at the United
Nations." This was accomplished in May 2004, when Israel was granted a
permanent renewal for WEOG proceedings in New York.

However, it was not until November 2013 when Israel was finally admitted into
WEOG proceedings at the United Nations Geneva Office, 1 January 2014.

## Suggested reform

In his address before the General Assembly at the 55th General Debate, Vinci
Niel Clodumar, the head of the Nauru Delegation, advocated for the creation of
a new Oceania regional group to include both Australia and New Zealand, as
well as the ASEAN member countries, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the
Pacific island countries. In his speech he mentioned that "the 11 Pacific
island countries are drowning in the Asian Group, while Australia and New
Zealand...are marooned in the Group of Western European and other States."

The Western European and Others Group was originally created in 1957 without
its consent, after Latin America, Asia and Africa, and Eastern Europe made
their own groups. States like Australia wanted to keep the previous
Commonwealth group, while states like France did not want to caucus with the
Commonwealth states. At first, Canada considered applying for the Latin
American group and renaming it a "Western Hemisphere" group, while Australia
and New Zealand considered applying for the Asian group.

Between 1957 and 1963, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa
negotiated with the Western European states for WEOG seats on the United
Nations General Committee, while simultaneously not recognizing themselves as
WEOG members. Australia obtained seats in 1958 and 1962, Canada obtained a
seat in 1960, and South Africa obtained a seat in 1959. In 1964, the Western
European states formally invited Canada, Australia, and New Zealand into their
caucus, while refusing to invite Israel and South Africa.

Under pressure from the Soviet Union, Finland was initially in the Eastern
European Group until 1960. Finland switched to WEOG in 1961.

Turkey was a member of the Asian group electorally until at least 1961,
switching to WEOG by 1963. The General Assembly does not have a record of
which group Turkey was a member of electorally in 1962.[_better source
needed_]

The wording of the 1957 General Assembly resolution placed the permanent
members of the Security Council in their own group, causing France, the United
Kingdom, and the United States to not count as part of WEOG electorally. When
ECOSOC was expanded, the wording of the 1963 General Assembly resolution only
assigned groups to the nine new seats, leaving the aforementioned permanent
three still outside of WEOG electorally. When ECOSOC was expanded again, the
wording of the 1971 General Assembly resolution finally assigned groups to all
of the seats, formally placing the permanent three into WEOG electorally.

The above table excludes states who attended WEOG meetings prior to having
electoral weight. West Germany, Monaco, Switzerland, and the Holy See became
WEOG observers in 1967, while the first record from the US Department of State
of the United States attending a WEOG meeting as an observer is from 1970.

In approximately the first half of the 1960s, Yugoslavia participated in both
WEOG and the Eastern European Group (similar to Turkey participating in two
groups), but was only ever counted in the Eastern European Group electorally.
Also during this time, Cyprus participated in both WEOG and the Asian group,
but was only ever counted in the Asian group electorally. Both eventually left
WEOG around the mid-1960s.
