Regional intergovernmental and geopolitical organisation

The **South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation** (**SAARC**) is the
regional intergovernmental organization and geopolitical union of states in
South Asia. Its member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. SAARC comprises 3% of the world's
land area, 21% of the world's population and 5.21% (US$4.47 trillion) of the
global economy, as of 2021.

SAARC was founded in Dhaka on 8 December 1985. Its secretariat is based in
Kathmandu, Nepal. The organization promotes economic development and regional
integration. It launched the South Asian Free Trade Area in 2006. SAARC
maintains permanent diplomatic relations at the United Nations as an observer
and has developed links with multilateral entities, including the European
Union. However, due to the geopolitical conflict between India and Pakistan
and the situation in Afghanistan, the organization has been suspended for a
long time, and India currently cooperates with its eastern neighbors through
BIMSTEC.

## Historical background

The idea of co-operation among South Asian Countries was discussed in three
conferences: the Asian Relations Conference held in New Delhi in April 1947;
the Baguio Conference in the Philippines in May 1950; and the Colombo Powers
Conference held in Sri Lanka in April 1954.

In the ending years of the 1970s, the seven inner South Asian nations that
included Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri
Lanka, agreed upon the creation of a trade bloc and to provide a platform for
the people of South Asia to work together in a spirit of friendship, trust,
and understanding. For Bangladesh, a prime reason for proposing this regional
cooperation framework was the failure of its attempt to join ASEAN. Seeking to
replicate the sucesses of ASEAN and a way to legitimise his government,
President Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh later wrote official letters to the
leaders of the countries of South Asia, presenting his vision for the future
of the region and compelling arguments for co-operation.

During his visit to India in December 1977, Rahman discussed the issue of
regional cooperation with the Indian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai. In the
inaugural speech to the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee which met in
Kathmandu also in 1977, King Birendra of Nepal gave a call for close regional
cooperation among South Asian countries in sharing river waters.

After the USSR's intervention in Afghanistan, efforts to establish the union
were accelerated in 1979 amid the resulting rapid deterioration of the South
Asian security situation. Responding to Rahman and Birendra's convention,
officials of the foreign ministries of the seven countries met for the first
time in Colombo in April 1981. The Bangladeshi proposal was promptly endorsed
by Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Maldives, however India and Pakistan were
sceptical initially. The Indian concern was the proposal's reference to the
security matters in South Asia and feared that Rahman's proposal for a
regional organisation might provide an opportunity for new smaller neighbours
to re-internationalize all bilateral issues and to join with each other to
form an opposition against India. Pakistan assumed that it might be an Indian
strategy to organize the other South Asian countries against Pakistan and
ensure a regional market for Indian products, thereby consolidating and
further strengthening India's economic dominance in the region.

However, after a series of diplomatic consultations headed by Bangladesh
between South Asian UN representatives at the UN headquarters in New York,
from September 1979 to 1980, it was agreed that Bangladesh would prepare the
draft of a working paper for discussion among the foreign secretaries of South
Asian countries. The foreign secretaries of the inner seven countries again
delegated a Committee of the Whole in Colombo in September 1981, which
identified five broad areas for regional cooperation. New areas of co-
operation were added in the following years.

In 1983, at the international conference held in Dhaka by its Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the foreign ministers of the inner seven countries adopted
the Declaration on South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
and formally launched the Integrated Programme of Action (IPA) initially in
five agreed areas of cooperation, namely, Agriculture; Rural Development;
Telecommunications; Meteorology; and Health and Population Activities.

Officially, the union was established in Dhaka with Kathmandu being the
union's secretariat-general. The first SAARC summit was held in Dhaka on 7–8
December 1985 and hosted by the President of Bangladesh Hussain Ershad. The
declaration was signed by, namely, King of Bhutan Jigme Singye Wangchuk;
President of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq; Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi; King
of Nepal Birendra Shah; President of Sri Lanka JR Jayewardene; and President
of Maldives Maumoon Gayoom.

The member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives,
Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.

SAARC was founded by seven states in 1985. In 2005, Afghanistan began
negotiating their accession to SAARC and formally applied for membership in
the same year. The issue of Afghanistan joining SAARC generated a great deal
of debate in each member state, including concerns about the definition of
South Asian identity because Afghanistan is considered a Central Asian
country, while it is neither accepted as a Middle Eastern country, nor as a
Central Asian country, or as part of the Indian subcontinent, other than being
only in part of South Asia.

SAARC member states imposed a stipulation for Afghanistan to hold a general
election; the non-partisan elections were held in late 2005. Despite initial
reluctance and internal debates, Afghanistan joined SAARC as its eighth member
state in April 2007.

Despite the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2021, Afghanistan is
still a member of SAARC, despite calls for their suspension and none of the
other SAARC members recognizing the Taliban government. The issue was further
exasperated as it was Afghanistan's turn to select a Secretary General for
SAARC in 2023. All other members decided to skip Afghanistan and award the
selection to Bangladesh, with Nepali foreign secretary, Bharat Raj Paudyal,
stating that "When the term of the Bangladeshi secretary general ends, if the
problems in Afghanistan are resolved, the new secretary general will be from
Afghanistan, not from Bhutan."

### Observer countries

States with observer status include Australia, China, the European Union,
Iran, Japan, Mauritius, Myanmar, South Korea, and the United States.

China's 2007 application for observer status received strong support from
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal, and Pakistan. Other South Asian
members of SAARC agreed to support China's observer status, but were not as
strongly in favor.

On 2 August 2006, the foreign ministers of SAARC countries agreed in principle
to grant observer status to three applicants; the US and South Korea (both
made requests in April 2006), as well as the European Union (requested in July
2006). On 4 March 2007, Iran requested observer status, followed shortly by
Mauritius.

### Potential future members

Myanmar has expressed interest in upgrading its status from an observer to a
full member of SAARC. China has requested joining SAARC. Russia has applied
for observer status membership of SAARC. Turkey applied for observer status
membership of SAARC in 2012. South Africa has participated in meetings.
Indonesia, Jordan, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, Saudi Arabia, the United
Kingdom and Yemen have expressed interest.[_citation needed_]

## Secretariat

Secretariat of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in
Kathmandu, Nepal

The SAARC Secretariat was established in Kathmandu on 16 January 1987 and was
inaugurated by the late King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah of Nepal.

### Specialized bodies

SAARC member states have created the following specialized bodies of SAARC in
the member states which have special mandates and structures different from
the regional centers. These bodies are managed by their respective governing
boards composed of representatives from all the member states, the
representative of H.E. secretary-general of SAARC and the ministry of
foreign/external affairs of the host government. The heads of these bodies act
as member secretary to the governing board which reports to the programming
committee of SAARC.

### Regional Centres

The SAARC Secretariat is supported by following Regional Centres established
in the Member States to promote regional co-operation. These Centres are
managed by Governing Boards comprising representatives from all the Member
States, SAARC Secretary-General and the Ministry of Foreign/External Affairs
of the Host Government. The Director of the Centre acts as Member Secretary to
the Governing Board which reports to the Programming Committee. After 31
December 2015, there 6 regional centers were stopped by unanimous decision.
These are SMRC, SFC, SDC, SCZMC, SIC, SHRDC.

### Anthem

SAARC does not have an official anthem as yet like some other regional
organizations (e.g. ASEAN).

## Apex and Recognized Bodies

SAARC has six Apex Bodies, they are:

  * SAARC Chamber of Commerce & Industry (SCCI),
  * South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation in Law (SAARCLAW),
  * South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA),
  * South Asia Foundation (SAF),
  * South Asia Initiative to End Violence Against Children (SAIEVAC),
  * Foundation of SAARC Writers and Literature (FOSWAL)

SAARC also has about 18 recognized bodies.

## SAARC Disaster Management Centre

The SAARC Disaster Management Centre (SDMC) is a regional organization
established to enhance disaster risk management and response within the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) member states. Its primary
objective is to provide policy advice, technical support, capacity building,
and training for comprehensive disaster risk management in the region.

SAARC SDMC

**Key Functions:**

  * **Policy Advice and Technical Support:** SDMC offers guidance on disaster management policies and assists in developing systems to improve disaster resilience.
  * **Capacity Building and Training:** The center conducts training programs and workshops to strengthen the disaster management capabilities of member states.
  * **Information Exchange:** Facilitates the sharing of information and expertise among member countries to enhance collaborative disaster risk management efforts.

**Initiatives:**

  * **South Asian Disaster Knowledge Network:** A platform for sharing disaster-related information and best practices across the region.
  * **South Asia Digital Vulnerability Atlas (SADVA):** An initiative aimed at mapping and analyzing disaster vulnerabilities in South Asia.

## Political issues

Lasting peace and prosperity in South Asia has been elusive because of the
various ongoing conflicts in the region. Political dialogue is often conducted
on the margins of SAARC meetings which have refrained from interfering in the
internal matters of its member states. During the 12th and 13th SAARC summits,
extreme emphasis was laid upon greater cooperation between SAARC members to
fight terrorism.

The 19th SAARC summit scheduled to be held in Pakistan was called off as
India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan decided to boycott it due to a
terrorist attack on an army camp in Uri. It was the first time that four
countries boycotted a SAARC summit, leading to its cancellation.

The failure of SAARC can also be attributed to conflicts among some of its
members. Pakistan would “indirectly target” India at summits, and “try to get
the other members to gang up against Delhi,” a retired Sri Lankan foreign
secretary told _The Diplomat_ in 2019. India, for its part, continued to
emphasize its concerns over terrorism linked to Pakistan, which it regarded as
a bilateral matter and therefore not appropriate for discussion in
multilateral settings.

SAARC has faced persistent challenges related to terrorism, including cross-
border militancy and allegations of state-sponsored extremism, over several
decades. In this context, terrorism has come to symbolize the organization's
stagnation, exacerbating existing divisions among member states. According to
global and regional terrorism analysts, terrorism in South Asia manifests in
various forms—such as state-supported militancy, extremist groups with alleged
state backing, separatist movements, and transnational extremist
networks—contributing to broader regional instability. The 2016 Uri attack
significantly impacted bilateral diplomatic relations and further hindered
regional cooperation efforts within SAARC.

Following political changes in Bangladesh, Dr. Muhammad Yunus, who served as
the chief adviser to the interim government in Bangladesh, had publicly
expressed interest in revitalizing the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) on multiple occasions. However, some policymakers in India
viewed Bangladesh's initiative with skepticism. India’s External Affairs
Minister, S. Jaishankar, reportedly indicated that Bangladesh was “batting for
Pakistan” by attempting to revive SAARC. During a bilateral meeting between
Bangladesh’s Foreign Affairs Adviser Towhid Hossain and External Affairs
Minister Jaishankar in Muscat, Oman, on 16 February, India issued a strong
statement on terrorism. According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA),
Jaishankar urged Bangladesh “to stop batting for Pakistan and normalising
terrorism” through efforts to resume SAARC’s activities. MEA spokesperson
Randhir Jaiswal, speaking at a press briefing, stated: “Everyone in South Asia
is aware of which country and what activities are responsible for stymieing
SAARC. EAM conveyed that it is important that Bangladesh should not normalise
terrorism.” While Pakistan was not named directly, the remarks were widely
interpreted as referring to its alleged role in undermining regional
cooperation.

Dr. Minendra Rijal, former Defence Minister of Nepal, stated that Pakistan’s
support for terrorism has contributed to the stagnation of SAARC, obstructed
regional economic integration, and resulted in substantial economic losses for
Pakistan.

China too has been trying to undermine the SAARC grouping and has been
suggesting alternatives for the same. Analysts in New Delhi have expressed
little surprise at the proposed initiative by China and Pakistan for regional
cooperation in South Asia. According to a research fellow at the Manohar
Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, China has sought to
promote alternative regional frameworks since its proposal to join SAARC was
rejected in 2005. Over the past two decades, it has launched several
mechanisms for regional engagement, including the China-South Asia Cooperation
Forum in 2006, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Trans-Himalayan Connectivity
Network in 2018—which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nepal—and the China-
South Asian Countries Poverty Alleviation and Cooperative Development Center
in 2021.All South Asian countries, except India and Bhutan, are members of the
BRI. As such, the latest proposal for regional cooperation is seen as part of
China's continued efforts to build alternatives to SAARC.

SAARC has generally been ineffective at achieving enhanced regionalism.

## South Asian Free Trade Area

Countries under the South Asian Free Trade Area

The SAFTA was envisaged primarily as the first step towards the transition to
a South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) leading subsequently towards a Customs
Union, Common Market and the Economic Union. In 1995, Sixteenth session of the
Council of Ministers (New Delhi, 18–19 December 1995) agreed on the need to
strive for the realization of SAFTA and to this end, an Inter-Governmental
Expert Group (IGEG) was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for
progressing to a free trade area. The Tenth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 29–31 July
1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to draft a comprehensive
treaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking into
consideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in
mind the need to fix realistic and achievable targets.

The SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit
held in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January
2006, and the Trade Liberalization Programme commenced from 1 July 2006. Under
this agreement, SAARC members will bring their duties down to 20 percent by
2009. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA Ministerial Council
(SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member
States. In 2012 SAARC exports increased substantially to $354.6 billion from
$206.7 billion in 2009. Imports too increased from $330 billion to $602
billion over the same period. But the intra-SAARC trade amounts to just a
little over 1% of SAARC's GDP. In contrast to SAARC, in ASEAN (which is
actually smaller than SAARC in terms of the size of the economy) the intra-
bloc trade stands at 10% of its GDP.

The SAFTA was envisaged to gradually move towards the South Asian Economic
Union, but the current intra-regional trade and investment relation are not
encouraging and it may be difficult to achieve this target. SAARC intra-
regional trade stands at just five percent on the share of intra-regional
trade in overall trade in South Asia. Similarly, foreign direct investment is
also dismal. The intra-regional FDI flow stands at around four percent of the
total foreign investment.

The Asian Development Bank has estimated that inter-regional trade in SAARC
region possessed the potential of shooting up agricultural exports by $14
billion per year from existing level of $8 billion to $22 billion. The study
by Asian Development Bank states that against the potential average SAARC
intra-regional trade of $22 billion per year, the actual trade in South Asia
has been only around $8 billion. The uncaptured potential for intra-regional
trade is therefore $14 billion per year, i.e., 68%.

## SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme

The SAARC Visa Exemption Scheme was launched in 1992. The leaders at the
Fourth Summit (Islamabad, 29–31 December 1988), realizing the importance of
people-to-people contact among SAARC countries, decided that certain
categories of dignitaries should be entitled to a Special Travel document. The
document would exempt them from visas within the region. As directed by the
Summit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of
entitled categories.

Currently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include
dignitaries, judges of higher courts, parliamentarians, senior officials,
entrepreneurs, journalists, and athletes.

The Visa Stickers are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled
categories of that particular country. The validity of the Visa Sticker is
generally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the
Immigration Authorities of SAARC Member States.

## Awards
