Nordic Council session in Helsinki, Finland (October 2012) Flag before 2016

The **Nordic Council** is the official body for formal inter-parliamentary
Nordic cooperation among the Nordic countries. Formed in 1952, it has 87
representatives from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden as well as
from the autonomous areas of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Åland. The
representatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or
areas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary
sessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year
with a specific theme. The council's official languages are Danish, Finnish,
Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish, though it uses only the mutually
intelligible Scandinavian languages—Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish—as its
working languages. These three comprise the first language of around 80% of
the region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the
remaining 20%.

In 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental forum, was
established to complement the council. The Council and the Council of
Ministers are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas
in Northern Europe, including the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the
Benelux countries and the Baltic states.

## History

During World War II, Denmark and Norway were occupied by Germany; Finland was
under assault by the Soviet Union; while Sweden, though neutral, still felt
the war's effects. Following the war, the Nordic countries pursued the idea of
a Scandinavian defence union to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland,
due to its Paasikivi–Kekkonen policy of neutrality and FCMA treaty with the
USSR, could not participate.

It was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and
defence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with NATO,
which some were planning at the time. The United States, keen on getting
access to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of
defending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for
Scandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for
their post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and
Iceland joining NATO as founding members. Finland and Sweden joined NATO in
2023 and 2024, respectively, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Further Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed.
This led Danish Prime Minister Hans Hedtoft to propose, on 13 August 1951, a
consultative interparliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark,
Iceland, Norway, and Sweden during a meeting in Copenhagen on 15–16 March
1952. The council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13
February 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-
Soviet relations thawed following the death of Joseph Stalin, Finland joined
the council in 1955, following a voting in the Parliament of Finland on 28
October that year, effective from 23 December the same year.

On 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building
upon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the Nordic Passport Union was created.
These two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the
area. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There
were also plans for a single market but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly
before Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the European Free Trade Area (EFTA).
Finland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway
applied to join the European Economic Community (EEC).

This move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The
Helsinki Treaty outlined the workings of the council and came into force on 24
March 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the
following years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and
Nordic House in Reykjavík were created. Danish Prime Minister Hilmar
Baunsgaard proposed full economic cooperation ("Nordek") in 1968. Nordek was
agreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the
Soviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential
members of the EEC (Denmark and Norway). Nordek was then abandoned.

As a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic
Council of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic
cooperation. In 1970 representatives of the Faroe Islands and Åland were
allowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish
delegations. Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as
a bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics. Also in 1973, although it
did not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade
treaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on,
although there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden
did not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving
neutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more
active role in circumpolar affairs.

In the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the Nordic Industrial Fund, Nordtest
and the Nordic Investment Bank. The council's remit was also expanded to
include environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in
the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, a joint energy network was established.
The Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983 and, in 1984,
representatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Nordic Council began
to cooperate more with the Baltic states and new Baltic Sea organisations.
Sweden and Finland joined the European Union (EU), the EEC's successor, in
1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.
However, Norway and Iceland did join the European Economic Area (EEA) which
integrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also
subsumed into the EU's Schengen Area in 1996.

The Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the Arctic, Baltic, Europe,
and Canada. The Øresund Bridge linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large
amount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce
barriers. However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic
Council have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the
EU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began EU membership talks, but decided to annul
these in 2015. Unlike the Benelux, there is no explicit provision in the
Treaty on European Union that takes into account Nordic co-operation. However,
the Treaties provide that international agreements concluded by the Member
States before they become members of the Union remain valid, even if they are
contrary to the provisions of Union law. However, each Member State must take
all necessary measures to eliminate any discrepancies as quickly as possible.
Nordic co-operation can therefore in practice only be designed to the extent
that it complies with Union law.

## Organisation

### Council

The Nordic Council consists of 87 representatives, elected from its members'
parliaments and reflecting the relative representation of the political
parties in those parliaments. It holds its main session in the autumn, while a
so-called "theme session" is arranged in the spring. Each of the national
delegations has its own secretariat in the national parliament. The autonomous
territories – Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Åland – also have Nordic
secretariats.

The Council does not have any formal power on its own, but each government has
to implement any decisions through its national legislature. With all
countries being members of NATO, the Nordic Council has not been involved in
any military cooperation.

### Council of Ministers

The original Nordic Council concentrates on inter-parliamentary cooperation.
The _Nordic Council of Ministers_ , founded in 1971, is responsible for
intergovernmental cooperation. Prime Ministers have ultimate responsibility
but this is usually delegated to the Minister for Nordic Cooperation and the
Nordic Committee for Co-operation, which coordinates the day-to-day work. The
autonomous territories have the same representation as states. The Nordic
Council of Ministers has offices in the Baltic countries.

### Secretary General

  * Secretary-General of the Nordic Council

### Languages

The Nordic Council uses the three Continental Scandinavian languages (Danish,
Norwegian, and Swedish) as its official working languages, while
interpretation and translation service is arranged for Finnish and Icelandic
(but never between the Scandinavian languages). The council also publishes
material in English for information purposes. The Council refers to Danish,
Norwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be
different forms of the same language forming a common language community.
Since 1987, under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic
countries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting
with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any
interpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to
hospitals, job centres, the police, and social security offices. The languages
included are Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish.

On 31 October 2018, the council established it has five official languages,
giving Finnish and Icelandic equal status with Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish
from 1 January 2020 onward. While the working languages of the council's
secretariat remain the three Scandinavian languages, the Council emphasised
that the secretariat must include personnel with comprehensive understanding
of Finnish and Icelandic as well. The then-President of the Council Michael
Tetzschner thought the compromise good but also expressed concern over the
change's expenses and hoped they would not increase so much that there would
be pressure to switch over to using English.

## Work

### Language understanding

The Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers have a particular focus
on strengthening the Nordic language community; the main focus of their work
to promote language understanding in the Nordic countries is on children and
young people's understanding of written and oral Danish, Norwegian, and
Swedish, the three mutually intelligible Scandinavian languages.

## Location

Nordic Council headquarters in Copenhagen. White building with Norden sign and
flag at street Ved Stranden No. 18.

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers have their headquarters in
Copenhagen and various installations in each separate country, as well as many
offices in neighbouring countries. The headquarters are located at Ved
Stranden No. 18, close to Slotsholmen.

## Observer, guests and other cooperation with neighbouring countries and
regions

In accordance with § 13 of the Rules of Procedure for the Nordic Council the
Sámi Parliamentary Council is the only institution with observer status with
the Nordic Council. In accordance with § 14, the Nordic Youth Council has the
status of "guest" on a permanent basis, and the Presidium "may invite
representatives of popularly elected bodies and other persons to a session and
grant them speaking rights" as guests. According to the council, "within the
last couple of years, guests from other international and Nordic organisations
have been able to take part in the debates at the Sessions. Visitors from the
Baltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this
opportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are
invited to the Theme Session."

The Nordic Council of Ministers has established four _Offices outside the
Nordic Region_ : In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the German state of
Schleswig-Holstein. The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic
Council of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary
mission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic
states and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies
within the Baltic states.

The Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers also define Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania, and Russia as "Adjacent Areas" and has formal cooperation with them
under the Adjacent Areas policies framework.

The Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic
independence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in
the Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status
in the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was
heavily opposed by the Soviet Union, accusing the Nordic Council of getting
involved in its internal affairs. In the same year, the Nordic Council refused
to give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic
states.

While the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal
observer status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on
different levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states
and Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of
Schleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the
first time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border
cooperation with Denmark and has a Danish minority population. As
parliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the South
Schleswig Voter Federation and a member of the Social Democrats with ties to
the Danish minority were elected.

The Sámi political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic
Council's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the
Sámi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the Sámi people
are de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In
addition, the Faroe Islands have expressed their wishes for full membership in
the Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.

Three of the members of the Nordic Council (Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, all
EU member states), the Baltic Assembly, and the Benelux sought intensifying
cooperation in the Digital Single Market, as well as discussing social
matters, the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, the European
migrant crisis and defense cooperation. Foreign relations in the wake of
Russia's annexation of Crimea and the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum
were also on the agenda.

Following the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the Finnish member of
Parliament Mikko Kärnä announced he would launch an initiative at the Nordic
council to grant Scotland observer status. Scotland's relationship with the
Nordics has also been explored by Scottish journalist Anthony Heron, who would
go on to interview Bertel Haarder on the topic.

## Nordic unification

Some desire the Nordic Council's promotion of Nordic cooperation to go much
further than at present. If the states of Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
and Finland were to merge in such an integration as some desire, it would
command a gross domestic product of US$1.60 trillion, making it the twelfth
largest economy in the world, larger than that of Australia, Spain, Mexico, or
South Korea. Gunnar Wetterberg, a Swedish historian and economist, wrote a
book entered into the Nordic Council's year book that proposes the creation of
a Nordic Federation from the Council in a few decades.
