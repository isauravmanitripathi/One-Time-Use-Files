Economic and social development IGO (est 1951)

The **Colombo Plan** is a regional intergovernmental organization that began
operations on 1 July 1951. The organization was conceived at an international
conference, The Commonwealth Conference on Foreign Affairs held in Colombo,
Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in January 1950, and was attended by the finance
ministers of Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Ceylon, Pakistan and New
Zealand, and the prime ministers of Ceylon and India. Membership has expanded
significantly over the years to the current 28 governments.

The primary focus of its work is on the development of human resources in the
south and southeast regions of Asia. Aid to education 1950 to 1983 came to $72
billion, of which $41 billion came from the United States.

## Host country of the Colombo Plan

The Colombo Plan enjoys a host country agreement with the Government of Sri
Lanka in the form of a memorandum of understanding with privileges and
immunities that are afforded by the Government of Sri Lanka.

In a speech made in Colombo on 5 July 2010, the 4th Secretary-General Dato'
Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia said: "The gearing up of the level of our activities is
made possible through the voluntary contributions of member countries and
international agencies such as OPEC fund. Last year our programming was over
US$10 million and we expect a more than US$12 million programming this year
with almost another US$2 million in terms of cost-sharing from our member
countries. With funding from the United States Government and 13 other member
countries, the Colombo Plan is now the biggest stakeholder in drug demand
reduction in the Asia-Pacific, with a special initiative in Afghanistan."

## Programmes

The Colombo Plan has four programmes:

  * Drug Advisory Programme (DAP, estd: 1973)
  * Gender Affairs Programme (GAP, estd: 2014)
  * Programme for Environment & Climate Change (ENV, estd: 2016)
  * Capacity Building Programme (CBP)

## Past Programmes

  * Long-Term Scholarships Programme (LTSP, estd: 1951)
  * Programme for Private Sector Development (PPSD, estd: 1995)
  * Programme for Public Administration & Environment (PPA, estd: 1995)

## The Plan now

Over the years, while adhering to the concept of human resource development
and South-South Cooperation in addressing issues of economic and social
development, the programme content of the Colombo Plan has been changing to
take account of the needs of member countries in a fast changing world
economic environment. In the early years, the training programmes were more of
a long-term nature, while recent programmes have been focusing on providing
advanced skills and experience sharing aimed at arriving at the best practices
in different fields of economic and social activities as a means of good
policy making and governance. The current programmes of the Colombo Plan are
in the areas of public policy formulation in an environment of globalisation
and market economy, private sector development as a prime mover for growth,
drug use and dependence prevention and treatment in member countries and
addressing gender issues. The Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician
Education located in Manila also provides skill development opportunities for
technicians in middle level.

In her 2010 speech, Dato' Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia states: "The current Colombo
Plan looks very different since our restructuring and revitalisation in 1995.
As we continue to build upon our past successes, the new Colombo Plan uses
cooperation among developing member countries or South-south Cooperation
between the developed member countries and developing member countries, to
underpin all our activities. Since our restructuring in 1995, we have now
provided 16,082 scholarships to 23 member countries for both long-term and
short-term training programmes."

## Past secretaries-general

The Colombo Plan underwent an organisational transformation and renewal in
1995, and the Colombo Plan Bureau became the Colombo Plan Secretariat to be
headed by the Secretary-General, instead of a Director. The first Secretary-
General was Dr. Kim Hak-su from Korea (January 1995 – March 1999) who was
succeeded by Dr. Sarat Chandran, India (April 1999 – June 2003), Mr. Kittipan
Kanjanapitkul from Thailand (June 2003 – August 2007), Dato' Patricia Yoon-Moi
Chia from Malaysia (August 2007 – August 2011), the first Asian woman to hold
this position, Mr. Adam Maniku from Maldives (15 August 2011 – November 2013),
Mr. Kinley Dorji from Bhutan (May 2014 – April 2018) and, Ambassador Phan Kieu
Thu (May 2018 - December 2021). The incumbent Secretary-General, Dr. Benjamin
P. Reyes from The Philippines assumed duties on 1 May 2022 as the
organisation's 8th Secretary-General.

## Early criticism

The Plan has been criticised on various grounds. Some Asians see in it only
the hand of British imperialism, especially as it is not aimed at developing
national self-sufficiency. It offers an almost exclusively economic solution
for problems which are also political and social. Dangerous issues such as
landlordism and the organisation of labour, which invite Communist
exploitation, are barely touched on, doubtless because it seemed politically
inexpedient to raise such questions.

The Colombo Plan currently has 30 members.
