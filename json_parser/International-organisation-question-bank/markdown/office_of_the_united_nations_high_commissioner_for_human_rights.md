UN Secretariat department that promotes human rights under international law

The **Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights**
(**OHCHR**) is a department of the United Nations Secretariat that works to
promote and protect human rights that are guaranteed under international law
and stipulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. The
office was established by the United Nations General Assembly on 20 December
1993 in the wake of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights.

The office is headed by the high commissioner for human rights, who co-
ordinates human rights activities throughout the United Nations System and
acts as the secretariat of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland.
The eighth and current high commissioner is Volker Türk of Austria, who
succeeded Michelle Bachelet of Chile on 8 September 2022.

In 2018–2019, the department had a budget of US$201.6 million (3.7 per cent of
the United Nations regular budget), and approximately 1,300 employees based in
Geneva and New York City. It is an ex officio member of the Committee of the
United Nations Development Group.

## Functions and organization

### Mandate

OHCHR presence at the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human

The mandate of OHCHR derives from Articles 1, 13 and 55 of the Charter of the
United Nations, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and General
Assembly resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993, by which the Assembly
established the post of United Nations high commissioner for human rights. In
connection with the programme for reform of the United Nations (A/51/950,
para. 79), the OHCHR and the Centre for Human Rights were consolidated into a
single OHCHR on 15 September 1997.

### Purpose

The objectives of OHCHR are to:

  1. Promote universal enjoyment of all human rights by giving practical effect to the will and resolve of the world community as expressed by the United Nations
  2. Play the leading role on human rights issues and emphasize the importance of human rights at the international and national levels
  3. Promote international cooperation for human rights
  4. Stimulate and coordinate action for human rights throughout the United Nations system
  5. Promote universal ratification and implementation of international standards
  6. Assist in the development of new norms
  7. Support human rights organs and treaty monitoring bodies
  8. Respond to serious violations of human rights
  9. Undertake preventive human rights action
  10. Promote the establishment of national human rights infrastructures
  11. Undertake human rights field activities and operations
  12. Provide education, information advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights

### Organization

The OHCHR is divided into organizational units, as described below. The OHCHR
is headed by a High Commissioner with the rank of Under-Secretary-General.

#### High Commissioner for Human Rights (Under-Secretary-General)

The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, accountable to the
secretary-general, is responsible for all the activities of the OHCHR, as well
as for its administration, and carries out the functions specifically assigned
to him or her by the UN General Assembly in its resolution 48/141 of 20
December 1993 and subsequent resolutions of policy-making bodies. He or she
advises the Secretary-General on the policies of the United Nations in the
area of human rights, ensures that substantive and administrative support is
given to the projects, activities, organs and bodies of the human rights
programme, represents the secretary-general at meetings of human rights organs
and at other human rights events, and carries out special assignments as
decided by the secretary-general. As well as those human rights that are
currently included in legally binding treaties, the high commissioner also
promotes human rights yet to be recognized in international law (such as the
adoption of economic, social and cultural rights as a strategic priority,
which are not all currently recognized in international legal instruments).

#### Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights (Assistant Secretary-General)

The United Nations high commissioner for human rights, in the performance of
his or her activities, is assisted by a deputy high commissioner who acts as
officer-in-charge during the absence of the high commissioner. In addition,
the deputy high commissioner carries out specific substantive and
administrative assignments as decided by the high commissioner. The deputy is
accountable to the high commissioner.

The current deputy high commissioner for human rights is the Australian
national Kate Gilmore.

New York Office represents the high commissioner at United Nations
Headquarters in New York and promotes the integration of human rights in
policy processes and activities undertaken by inter-governmental and inter-
agency bodies at the United Nations.

The post of assistant secretary-general for human rights was created in 2010,
when Ivan Šimonović was appointed to the position. From 2016 to 2019, the

## Criticisms

In July 2025, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk issued a
statement ahead of a High-Level Conference on Palestine, calling for
international pressure on the Israeli government to end military operations in
Gaza. Türk described Gaza as "a dystopian landscape of deadly attacks and
total destruction" and reported that according to the Gaza Ministry of Health,
more than 200,000 Palestinians had been killed or injured since October 7,
representing approximately ten percent of the territory's population.

Journalist Emma Reilly leaked e-mails in 2020 and 2021 in which the OHCHR
provided names of Chinese participants in UN human rights activities to China
on request. This occurred on multiple occasions from before 2012 to at least
2019, despite an explicit ban against this sort of activity. In some cases,
after obtaining their name in advance from the UN, the Chinese Communist Party
made sure an activist was not able to leave China for Geneva to attend.
