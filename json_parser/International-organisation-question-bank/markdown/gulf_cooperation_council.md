Regional trade bloc in the Middle East

The **Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf** (Arabic: مجلس
التعاون لدول الخليج العربيّة), also known as the **Gulf Cooperation Council**
(**GCC** ; Arabic: مجلس التعاون الخليجي), is a regional, intergovernmental,
political, and economic union and military alliance comprising Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The council's
main headquarters is located in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The
Charter of the GCC was signed on 25 May 1981, formally establishing the
institution.

All current member states are monarchies, including three constitutional
monarchies (Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain), two absolute monarchies (Saudi Arabia
and Oman), and one federal monarchy (the United Arab Emirates, which is
composed of seven member states, each of which is an absolute monarchy with
its own emir). There have been discussions regarding the future membership of
Jordan, Morocco, and Yemen. Iraq is the only Gulf Arab state that is not a GCC
member.

During the Arab Spring in 2012, Saudi Arabia proposed to transform the GCC
into a "Gulf Union" with tighter economic, political and military
coordination, a move considered to be intended to counterbalance Iranian
influence in the region; however, objections were raised by other countries.
In 2014, Bahraini prime minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa said that
current events in the region highlighted the importance of the proposal. The
Peninsula Shield Force is the military arm of the GCC, formed in 1984.

## History and founding

Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah of Kuwait, alongside the support of Sheikh
Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan of the UAE, played a crucial role in fostering the
idea of closer cooperation among the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, laying
the groundwork for the formation of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The members'
shared vision for regional unity, security, and economic integration led to
the official establishment of the GCC in 1981, strengthening the collective
power and influence of the Gulf countries.

The charter was signed in Arabic in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on 21
Rajab 1401 on the Islamic calendar (corresponding to 25 May 1981 on the
Gregorian calendar).

The signatory states on the founding document are the only current members of
the GCC.

An economic agreement between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council
was signed on 11 November 1981 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. These countries are often
referred to as "the GCC states".

### Objectives

In 2001, the GCC Supreme Council set the following goals:

  * Customs union in January 2003.
  * Common market by 2007
  * Common currency by 2010

Oman announced in December 2006 that it would not be able to meet the 2010
target date for a common currency. Following the announcement that the central
bank for the monetary union would be located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, rather
than in the UAE, they announced their withdrawal from the monetary union
project in May 2009. The name Khaleeji has been proposed as a name for this
currency. If realized, the GCC monetary union would be the second-largest
supranational monetary union in the world, measured by the GDP of the common-
currency area, following the Eurozone.

Other stated objectives include:

  * Formulating similar regulations in various fields such as religion, finance, trade, customs, tourism, legislation, and administration.
  * Fostering scientific and technical progress in industry, mining, agriculture, water, and animal resources.
  * Establishing scientific research centers.
  * Setting up joint ventures.
  * Unified military (Peninsula Shield Force).
  * Encouraging cooperation of the private sector.
  * Strengthening ties between their people.

GCC–US Summit in Riyadh on 21 April 2016

The area has some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to
a boom in oil and natural gas revenues coupled with a building and investment
boom backed by decades of saved petroleum revenues. In an effort to build a
tax base and economic foundation before the reserves run out, the UAE's
investment arms, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, retain over US$900
billion in assets. Other regional funds have several hundreds of billions of
dollars of assets under management.

The region is an emerging hotspot for events, including the 2006 Asian Games
in Doha, Qatar. Doha also submitted an unsuccessful application for the 2016
Summer Olympics. Qatar would later host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Recovery plans have been criticized for crowding out the private sector,
failing to set clear priorities for growth, failing to restore weak consumer
and investor confidence, and undermining long-term stability.

### Logo

The logo of the GCC consists of two concentric circles. On the upper part of
the larger circle, the phrase Bismillah \- "in the name of God" - is written
in Arabic, and on the lower part of the circle is written the council's full
name. The inner-circle contains an embossed hexagonal shape representing the
six countries. The inside of the hexagon shows a map encompassing the Arabian
Peninsula, on which the areas of the member countries are colored in brown,
borderless.

## Economy

to connect all six GCC member states, can be seen in yellow.

### Internal market

A common market was launched on 1 January 2008, easing movement of goods and
services, with plans to create a fully integrated single market.
Implementation later lagged behind, after the 2008 financial crisis. The
creation of a customs union began in 2003, and was completed and fully
operational by 1 January 2015. In January 2015, the common market was also
further integrated, covering full equality among GCC citizens to work in
government and private sectors, the ability to access social insurance and
retirement coverage, real estate ownership rights, capital movement, and
access to education, health and other social services, in all member states.
However, some barriers remained in the free movement of goods and services.
The coordination of taxation systems, accounting standards and civil
legislation is currently[_when?_] in progress. The interoperability of
professional qualifications, insurance certificates and identity documents is
also underway.

### Monetary union

In 2014, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia took major steps to ensure
the creation of a single currency. Kuwait's finance minister said the four
members are pushing ahead with the monetary union but said some "technical
points" need to be cleared. He added, "A common market and common central bank
would also position the GCC as one entity that would have great influence on
the international financial system". The implementation of a single currency
and the creation of a central bank is overseen by the Monetary Council.

There is currently a degree to which a nominal GCC single currency already
exists. Businesses trade using a basket of GCC currencies, just as before the
Euro was introduced, the European Currency Unit (ECU) had been used as a
nominal medium of exchange. Plans to introduce a single currency had been
drawn up as far back as 2009, however due to the 2008 financial crisis and
political differences, the UAE and Oman withdrew their membership.

### Mergers and acquisitions

Companies and investors from GCC countries are active in mergers and
acquisitions. Since 1999, more than 5,200 transactions with a known value of
US$573 billion had been announced. Investors include a number of sovereign
wealth funds.

### Infrastructure

The GCC launched common economic projects to promote and facilitate
integration and to increase resilency. The GCC Interconnection Grid connects
the power grids of member states. In 2009, it initiated operations and by
2013, all six members were connected. A water interconnection project has been
discussed but, as of January 2023, there have been no notable developments.
Unlike other leading aviation regions like the European Union, members have
not agreed to an open skies policy. As such, GCC airlines do not have
unlimited market access rights to member states and compete to capture
international air traffic flows.

The GCC has also launched major rail projects to connect the peninsula. The
railways are expected to fuel intra-regional trade while helping reduce fuel
consumption. Over US$200 billion will be invested to develop about 40,000
kilometres (25,000 mi) of rail network across the GCC, according to Oman's
Minister of Transport and Communications. According to Ramiz Al Assar,
Resident World Bank advisor for the GCC, it will link the six member states as
a regional transport corridor, further integrating with the national railway
projects, deepening economic social and political integration, and it is
developed from a sustainable perspective.

The project, estimated to be worth $15.5 billion, was scheduled to be
completed by 2021. As of May 2022, railway construction UAE and Saudi Arabia
have progressed significantly, but other members' efforts have lagged. Saudi
Arabian Railways, Etihad Rail, and their respective national governments have
invested 15 billion dollars as of early 2015 into railway infrastructure to
create rail networks for transporting freight, connecting cities, and reducing
transport times.

In the banking industry of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), diversity is
increasingly recognized as a strategic asset that goes beyond mere corporate
social responsibility. This shift towards embracing a diverse workforce is
driven by the recognition that varied perspectives and experiences spur
innovation, improve decision-making, and expand market reach in the fast-paced
world of finance, increasing market share and profitability.

## Free trade agreements

## Politics and governance

### Supreme Council

The GCC Supreme Council is composed of the heads of state of the member
states. It is the highest decision-making entity of the GCC, setting its
vision and goals. Decisions on important issues require unanimous approval,
while issues on procedural matters require a majority. Each member state has
one vote. The presidency rotates based on the Arabic alphabetical order of the
names of the member states.

### Ministerial Council

The Ministerial Council is composed of the Foreign Ministers of all the member
states. It convenes every three months. It formulates policies, and makes
recommendations to promote cooperation and achieve coordination among the
member states, when implementing ongoing projects. Decisions are submitted in
the form of recommendations, which the Supreme Council can approve. The
Ministerial Council is also responsible for preparations of meetings of the
Supreme Council and its agenda. The voting procedure in the Ministerial
Council is the same as in the Supreme Council.

### Secretariat General

The Secretariat is the executive arm of the Gulf Cooperation Council. It takes
decisions within its authority, and implements decisions approved by the
Supreme or Ministerial Council. The Secretariat also compiles studies relating
to cooperation, coordination, and planning for common actions, and
occasionally releases reports regarding the work done by the GCC as a whole,
and the implementation of its own decisions. The current Secretary-General is
Nayef Falah Mubarak Al Hajraf, and his deputies include Abdulaziz Al Auwaishig
and Khalifa Alfadhel.

### Monetary Council

On 15 December 2009, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia announced the
creation of a Monetary Council, to introduce a single currency for the union.
The board of the council, which set a timetable and action plan for
establishing a central bank and chose a currency regime, met for the first
time on 30 March 2010. Kuwaiti foreign minister Mohammad Sabah Al-Sabah said
on 8 December 2009 that a single currency may take up to ten years to
establish. Oman and the UAE later announced their withdrawal from the proposed
currency.

In 2014, major moves were taken to ensure the launch of a single currency.
Kuwait's finance minister stated that a currency should be implemented without
delay. Negotiations with the UAE and Oman to expand the monetary union were
renewed.

### Patent Office

The GCC Patent Office was approved in 1992, and established soon after in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Applications are filed and prosecuted in the Arabic
language before it and grants patents valid in all GCC member states, but is a
separate office from the Saudi Arabian Patent Office. The first GCC patent was
granted in 2002. As of 2013, it employed about 30 patent examiners.[_citation

### Peninsula Shield Force

Amidst the Bahraini uprising, Saudi Arabia and the UAE sent ground troops to
Bahrain in order to protect vital infrastructure such as the airport and
highway system. Kuwait and Oman refrained from sending troops. Instead, Kuwait
sent a navy unit.

The secretary-general of the GCC strongly endorsed the use of international
force in Libya. GCC member states joined coalition efforts to enforce the no-
fly zone.

In September 2014, GCC members Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Qatar, and
pending member Jordan commenced air operations against the Islamic State of
Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in Syria. Saudi Arabia and the UAE, however, are
among the states that oppose the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, whereas Qatar
has historically supported it. They also pledged other support including
operating training facilities for Syrian rebels, in Saudi Arabia, and allowing
the use of their airbases by other countries fighting ISIL. Some GCC countries
also send some troops to fight the opposition government in Yemen.

### GCC Standardization Organization

The GCC Standardization Organization is the standardization organization of
the GCC. Yemen is also a member of the GCC Standardization Organization.

### Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting

The Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC) was founded in 1976 by
the six GCC member states; Yemen joined the organization in 2009. It is
headquartered at Doha, Qatar. The organization chart of GOIC includes the
board members and the General Secretariat. The Board is formed by member state
representatives appointed by their governments.

## Member states

There are six member states of the union:

Country  | Population (2023, United Nations)  | Area  
(km2)  | GDP (nominal) | GDP (PPP) | HDI  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
(USD million)  | Per capita ($)  | (Int$ million)  | Per capita (Int$)

### Associated members

The associate membership of Iraq in certain GCC-related institutions was
cancelled after the invasion of Kuwait.

Yemen was in negotiations for GCC membership in 2007, and hoped to join by
2016. Yemen is already a member of the GCC Standardization Authority, the Gulf
Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC), the GCC Auditing and Accounting
Authority, the Gulf Radio and TV Authority, the GCC Council of Health
Ministers, the GCC Education and Training Bureau, the GCC Council of Labour &
and Social Affairs Ministers, and The Gulf Cup Football Tournament. The
Council issued directives that all the necessary legal measures be taken, so
that Yemen would have the same rights and obligations of GCC member states in
those institutions.

## Sports

The union has served as a grouping for sports co-operation and competition.
The GCC states have an annual meeting of the Youth and Sports Ministers of
each state to boost youth and sports initiatives in the region. The promotion
of the hosting of international sports events has also served an economic
purpose for the union's countries, leading to investment and development in
the region.

The GCC Games, a quadrennial multi-sport event, was established by the union
and first held in 2011. There are numerous long-running GCC Championships for
individual sports, including: the Gulf Cooperation Council Athletics
Championships (first held in 1986; youth section from 2000) sailing,
basketball, swimming, tennis, gymnastics (senior and youth levels),
weightlifting, futsal, snooker, and table tennis.

## 2014 Qatar–Saudi diplomatic conflict

Qatar's support for the Muslim Brotherhood across the Middle East-North Africa
(MENA) region, Hamas and radical Islamists in Libya, has led to increasing
tensions with other Arab states of the Persian Gulf. These tensions came to a
head during a March 2014 meeting of the GCC, after which the UAE, Saudi Arabia
and Bahrain recalled their ambassadors to Qatar.

Some financial economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi–Qatari rift as a
tangible political sign of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural
gas producers, which could "have deep and long-lasting consequences" beyond
MENA.

## 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis

On 5 June 2017, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt had officially cut
diplomatic ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut
diplomatic ties due to Qatar's "embrace of various terrorist and sectarian
groups aimed at destabilising the region", including the Muslim Brotherhood,
al-Qaeda, ISIL and Iran-supported groups in Saudi Arabia's eastern province of
Qatif. Political researcher Islam Hassan viewed this rift as a continuation of
Qatar's foreign policy rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

In June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain put a ban on
Qataris and their businesses. Qataris were not allowed to enter or live in
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or Bahrain, unless they had a spouse
living there, in which case they were required to carry a visa in order to
enter these countries. Qatar Airways aircraft were not allowed to fly over
these countries. Saudi Arabia stated that they would turn its land border with
Qatar into a canal, known as the Salwa Canal, in 2018. The plan was abandoned
in 2019.[_citation needed_]

On 4 January 2021, Kuwait National TV announced that Saudi Arabia would
restore all diplomatic ties with Qatar, reopen air space to Qatari aircraft
and reopen the Qatar–Saudi land border.[_citation needed_]

Later that evening, it was announced that Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates
and Egypt agreed to restore ties with Qatar. On 4 January 2021, it was made
official at the Al-Ula summit, where the blockading countries, along with
Qatar, signed an official agreement and ended the rift after three years and
seven months.[_citation needed_]

### GCC—Pakistan relations

In January 2022, the GCC and Pakistan finalised the Joint Action Plan for
Strategic Dialogue (2022–26). In September 2023, the GCC and Pakistan signed a
preliminary deal on a free trade agreement.

### GCC and EU Summit meetings

On 16 October 2024, the first GCC and the European Union summit was held in
Brussels, Belgium. It was co-chaired by Charles Michel and the rotating GCC
President Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, under the theme "Strategic
Partnership for Peace and Prosperity". The Human Rights Watch requested the EU
to take advantage of the first summit with Gulf leaders, and challenge the
involvement of the UAE and other neighbouring states in the Sudan civil war.
The EU director for HRW, Phillippe Dam said the union leaders should "publicly
press" the UAE to stop arms supply to the RSF and push the militia to end the
war.

Cooperation Council Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the leaders of
Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, the GGC and the United States, at the GCC+3 summit in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, 16 July 2022

Since the creation of the council in 1981 its membership has not expanded,
with all members being Arab monarchies.

Some GCC countries have land borders with Iraq, Jordan or Yemen, and sea
borders with Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Sudan, and Eritrea.

### Egypt

Only the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt lies in the Arabian Peninsula. In 2011,
Bahrain's Foreign Minister called for Egypt to be admitted as a member of the
GCC.

### Iraq

Iraq, despite having territory in the Arabian Peninsula and bordering the
Persian Gulf, is the only Arab country bordering the gulf that is not a member
of the GCC. Despite the societal, political differences between Iraq and its
neighboring Gulf states, in 2012, former Iraqi Defence Minister Saadoun al-
Dulaimi stated that Iraq wanted to join the GCC. Kuwait supported Iraq joining
the GCC, however no progress has been made.

### Iran

At the December 2012 Manama summit, the GCC states called for an end to
Iranian interference in their internal affairs.

### Jordan and Morocco

In May 2011, Jordan's request to join the GCC, which had been first submitted
15 years earlier, was accepted and Morocco was invited to join the union. In
September 2011, a five-year economic plan for both countries was put forward
after a meeting between the foreign ministers of both countries and those of
the GCC states. Although a plan for accession was being looked into, it was
noted that there was no timetable for either's accession, and that discussions
would continue.

As Jordan and Morocco are the only two Arabic-speaking monarchies not
currently in the council, the current members see them as strong potential
allies. Jordan borders Saudi Arabia and is economically connected to the Arab
Gulf States. Although Morocco is not near the Persian Gulf, the Moroccan
foreign minister Taieb Fassi Fihri notes that "geographical distance is no
obstacle to a strong relationship".

### Yemen

Yemen was in negotiations for GCC membership, and hoped to join by 2016.
Although it has no coastline on the Persian Gulf, Yemen lies in the Arabian
Peninsula.

## Related organizations

The GCC members and Yemen are also members of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area
(GAFTA). However, this is unlikely to affect the agenda of the GCC
significantly as it has a more aggressive timetable than GAFTA and is seeking
greater integration.
