Founded by treaty on 2 March 1923, the IPHC represents one of the region’s longest-standing institutional arrangements for transboundary marine resource management and one of the longest continuous fisheries datasets in the North Pacific and Bering Sea.\n\nHistorical and legal foundations\n- Founding treaty: Concluded 2 March 1923 to address declining halibut stocks and to provide a cooperative, science-informed framework for regulation of fishing and conservation across international boundaries.  \n- Treaty amendments: The original 1923 treaty was amended in 1953, 1976 and 1979. The 1979 amendment in particular clarified aspects of the IPHC’s role and authority in management.  \n- Domestic incorporation: In the United States, the treaty’s management role was incorporated into domestic law through the North Pacific Halibut Act of 1982, demonstrating how treaty-based obligations can be translated into national legal frameworks for implementation.  \n\nMandate and institutional form\n- Type and membership: An international fisheries organization composed of Canada and the United States.  \n- Primary responsibility: Scientific assessment and cooperative management of Pacific halibut stocks in the waters of the two member states. The IPHC operates at the interface of science and policy, producing stock assessments and making regulatory recommendations that influence quotas, fishing regulations and conservation measures.\n\nResearch, monitoring and field methods\n- Field sampling: The IPHC has historically used chartered commercial fishing vessels to sample the resource, deploying methods such as bottom trawls and long-lining to collect biological data. A historical field example is an engineer and biological aide working aboard the chartered trawler MV Arthur H., Alaska, in 1962—an emblem of the Commission’s long history of at-sea research.  \n- Additional techniques: Research activities have included banding of fish, in situ temperature recording with bathythermographs, and systematic sampling at fish processing plants. Onshore staff sample commercial catches and remove otoliths (ear bones) for age determination.  \n- Analytical value: Otolith-based aging, repeated long-term sampling and broad geographic coverage (North Pacific and Bering Sea) generate the time series and biological detail required for robust stock assessments and quota-setting.\n\nGovernance, meetings and outputs\n- Meetings: The IPHC maintains institutional routines, holding Annual Meetings and Special Meetings as necessary to consider scientific findings, review stock status, and make management recommendations.  \n- Outputs and influence: Scientific assessments and Commission recommendations typically inform harvest limits, spatial/temporal fishing regulations and conservation measures applied by member states.\n\nOffices and logistics\n- Location history: For many years the Commission’s offices were located on the University of Washington campus. In November 2010 the IPHC relocated to Seattle’s Interbay neighborhood, an industrial/maritime area that likely offered logistical advantages for a marine-focused agency.\n\nSignificance and lessons for strategic policy\n- Science-policy integration: The IPHC exemplifies durable integration of long-term scientific monitoring with cooperative management decisions — a model for resource governance where management outcomes depend on credible, shared data.  \n- Bilateral, treaty-based cooperation: As a two-party institution with a specific resource mandate, the IPHC shows how states can institutionalize joint stewardship of transboundary maritime resources while leaving implementation to domestic law (e.g., the U.S. North Pacific Halibut Act).  \n- Strategic relevance: For states developing maritime governance and national security strategies, the IPHC provides a useful comparative example: stable institutions, legal clarity through treaty amendment and domestic incorporation, and investment in long-term biological data strengthen predictability, reduce conflict over shared stocks, and enhance sustainability of economically and culturally important fisheries.\n\nThis concise profile of the IPHC highlights why it is frequently cited in studies of international fisheries governance: long institutional continuity, rigorous scientific practice (otolith aging, vessel-based sampling, temperature profiling), and an explicit treaty foundation that has been adapted through amendment and domestic legislation to sustain cooperative management across a shared maritime domain.",
