Its declared focus is scientific exploration of the Mediterranean basin and immediately adjacent seas. CIESM positions itself as a multilateral platform for coordinating marine research, sharing data and expertise, and organizing collective fieldwork across national boundaries.\n\n#### Membership, scale and participants\nCIESM brings together 23 Member States and mobilizes a much broader scientific constituency: hundreds of marine institutes and laboratories, and thousands of individual researchers participate in its programmes and networks. This scale — modest among global institutions but large for a regional body — gives CIESM substantive influence over regional research agendas, standards of practice and data continuity across the Mediterranean and neighbouring basins.\n\n#### Geographic remit\nThe Commission’s geographic remit explicitly covers all shores of the Mediterranean basin and “adjacent seas” — the Black Sea being a principal example. This sub‑regional focus encompasses multiple sub‑basins, coastal states with varied capacities, and a complex maritime environment that mixes environmental, economic, and geopolitical concerns. The delimitation around an ecological and maritime basin, rather than strict political borders, shapes the Commission’s cooperative logic.\n\n#### Historical origins and evolution\nCIESM was created by an international conference convened in Madrid in November 1919. Its origin in the immediate post‑World War I period gives it a long institutional history: a century of data accumulation, methodological continuity and archived expert networks. While the organization’s original membership was limited to countries directly bordering the Mediterranean and Black Seas, its rules have since been adapted to admit other states that are scientifically active in the broader region. This opening reflects an evolutionary pragmatism in response to changing scientific needs and geopolitical realities.\n\n#### Institutional character and operational approach\nCIESM describes itself as independent — a characterization that in practice denotes multilateral governance and funding arrangements rather than control by a single national government. Operationally, the Commission promotes collective, multilateral research by coordinating shared use of national research stations, platforms and logistical assets; by facilitating scientific exchanges and secondments; and by convening joint expeditions and meetings. Such arrangements lower transaction costs, build interoperability among national programmes, and create durable channels for knowledge exchange.\n\n#### Typical activities and outputs\nAlthough specific programme lines vary over time, the Commission’s typical activities include:\n- Coordinated research cruises and joint expeditions;\n- Regular international congresses, workshops and training courses;\n- Mechanisms for data sharing and publication of collective scientific findings;\n- Working groups and thematic networks focused on oceanography, biodiversity, fisheries, pollution and climate‑related change.\nTogether, these outputs produce both peer‑reviewed science and operational tools (databases, atlases, monitoring protocols) that serve researchers and policy‑makers alike.\n\n#### Strategic relevance and implications for national security policy\nFor a book on strategic culture and national security, CIESM provides a useful example of how scientific organizations intersect with security concerns:\n- Environmental and maritime scientific data produced under CIESM contribute to maritime domain awareness — a foundational input for coastal risk management, resource governance and naval planning.\n- Multilateral scientific platforms lower barriers to cooperation between states that may be politically adversarial, creating technical channels of communication and confidence‑building in contested maritime spaces.\n- The Commission’s model — shared use of national stations and pooled expertise — illustrates how soft‑power influence is exercised through science diplomacy and capacity building.\n- Opening membership beyond littoral states shows how non‑coastal powers can project influence into regional maritime governance through scientific partnerships rather than military means.\n\n#### Concluding note\nCIESM’s long history, regional focus and operational emphasis on shared logistics and scientific exchange make it a salient case of how international scientific organizations operate at the intersection of knowledge production and regional governance. For analysts of strategic culture, such bodies demonstrate the ways in which scientific collaboration can both underpin and reshape maritime policy, environmental security, and interstate relations in a bounded maritime region."

    "generated_section_content_md": "### Early years\n\nThe Mediterranean Science Commission (CIESM — Commission Internationale pour l'Exploration Scientifique de la Mer Méditerranée) was born in the decade before the First World War and consolidated in the immediate post‑war period. Its early development (1910–1939) illustrates how scientific initiative, high‑level patronage and deliberate institutional design combined to create a durable regional scientific body with practical policy reach.\n\nOrigins and founding meetings  \n- The initial conception came from two marine scientists: the Italian Decio Vinciguerra and the German Otto Krümmel, who proposed coordinated oceanographic exploration of the Mediterranean with a clear applied aim — improving the fishing industry through better scientific knowledge.  \n- Vinciguerra’s proposal won the endorsement of the 9th International Geographical Congress (Geneva, July 1908), which tasked a committee to define a suitable Commission. That committee met for the first time in Monaco on 30 March 1910 at the newly opened Oceanographic Museum, under the chairmanship of Albert I, Prince of Monaco.  \n- From these early deliberations two foundational principles were articulated: (1) the Commission must be insulated from party politics and political interference to preserve scientific credibility; and (2) member countries should be represented at government (not merely scholarly) level so that the Commission’s scientific advice would carry weight in policymaking and resource management.\n\nConstitutional steps and wartime disruption  \n- A preparatory trajectory led to a Rome meeting in February 1914 where delegates agreed that all states bordering the Mediterranean and the Black Sea should be eligible for membership, thereby extending the Commission’s prospective remit beyond the Mediterranean proper.  \n- World War I interrupted plans for a Constituent Assembly in 1914. The formal founding was postponed and only realised after the war: a preparatory meeting in Paris (June 1919) preceded the Constituent Assembly held in Madrid in November 1919. The Madrid session was chaired by King Alfonso XIII of Spain and brought together state representatives from Egypt, France, Greece, Italy, Monaco, Spain, Tunisia and Turkey. The newly constituted Commission elected Prince Albert I of Monaco as its first president; Italy took the presidency in 1924.\n\nEarly activities and institutional outputs (1919–1939)  \n- In its first two decades CIESM acted as a catalyst for scientific infrastructure across the region. It encouraged and helped spur the creation of marine observatories in places such as Algeria, Tunisia and Italy — facilities that collected long‑term oceanographic and biological data and provided baseline records still valuable for later historical comparisons.  \n- Nationally sponsored research vessels from France, Italy and Spain undertook coordinated mapping and survey campaigns focused on strategic bottlenecks and transition zones: the Strait of Gibraltar, the Bosphorus, the Strait of Messina and the Gulf of Gabès. These campaigns combined pure and applied science, mapping physical conditions while addressing fisheries‑related questions.  \n- Membership expanded through the interwar years: Romania (1925), the Kingdom of Serbs (1927) and Turkey (1928) joined the Commission. Reflecting the colonial and mandate politics of the period, several territories under British, French or Spanish mandate participated as separate members: Cyprus (1919), Palestine (1929), Syria and Lebanon (1930), and the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco (1933).\n\nKnowledge dissemination and scientific leadership  \n- CIESM established a structured publication programme typical of early twentieth‑century international science: a Bulletin, biennial Reports of Congresses, and an illustrated series Faune et Flore de Méditerranée documenting regional marine biodiversity. The Faune et Flore series was overseen by the noted French zoologist Louis Joubin.  \n- Biennial congresses and regular bulletins created predictable channels for exchange and for translating scientific findings into recommendations — an institutional habit that amplified the Commission’s influence across member states.\n\nIdeas, significance and continuity  \n- The Commission’s early history highlights several deliberate institutional choices: scientific independence to preserve credibility; state‑level representation to link science to policy; and regional inclusiveness that extended to the Black Sea and to mandate territories. These choices shaped both the authority and the practical impact of the organisation.  \n- Patronage mattered: Prince Albert I and the Oceanographic Museum of Monaco supplied prestige, leadership and an organisational hub for early oceanography, demonstrating how individual and state patrons can accelerate institutional formation.  \n- CIESM’s strategy — combining infrastructure creation (observatories, ships), regular knowledge exchange (congresses, bulletins) and an applied mandate (fisheries improvement) — is a textbook example of how an international scientific organisation can produce durable public goods.  \n- Crucially, the Commission displayed institutional resilience: geopolitical disruption (WWI) delayed but did not prevent its foundation, and interwar expansions show how science networks can persist and adapt amid shifting political orders.\n\nRelevance for Indian strategic and policy thinking (brief lessons)  \n- The CIESM case offers transferable lessons for India’s strategic culture and external engagement: anchoring scientific cooperation in state representation can increase the policy impact of technical advice; ensuring institutional independence helps sustain credibility across political cycles; and combining scientific diplomacy with tangible infrastructure (research stations, shared vessels, joint monitoring) creates long‑term ties and data patrimony.  \n- For India’s regional initiatives (Indian Ocean and beyond), CIESM’s experience underscores the value of high‑level patronage, clear applied goals (e.g., fisheries, maritime environmental monitoring), and inclusive membership rules that reflect the political geography of the region rather than strict cartographic definitions.\n\nNotes and context  \n- Acronym: CIESM = Commission Internationale pour l’Exploration Scientifique de la Mer Méditerranée.  \n- Key personalities: Prince Albert I of Monaco (oceanographer and patron), Decio Vinciguerra and Otto Krümmel (initiators), Louis Joubin (editor of Faune et Flore).  \n- Institutional location: the Oceanographic Museum, Monaco, functioned as an early hub for both science and public outreach.\n\nThis concise portrait of CIESM’s formative decades shows how scientific institutions are deliberately designed instruments of both knowledge production and policy influence — a point of direct relevance when assessing how states like India can structure their own scientific diplomacy and regional cooperation in maritime and security domains."

    "generated_section_content_md": "### 6.x The Mediterranean Science Commission (CIESM): institutional continuity, adaptation and the politics of scientific diplomacy\n\nThe Commission Internationale pour l'Exploration Scientifique de la mer Méditerranée (CIESM, commonly known in English as the Mediterranean Science Commission) provides a compact case study in how an international scientific organisation survives war, adapts governance and membership rules, and leverages political patronage and celebrity to sustain relevance. The Commission’s evolution — from interwar French-centric governance to a wider, research‑oriented membership and an increasingly centralised executive — illuminates several themes of relevance to strategic culture and national security policy: institutional resilience after systemic shocks, the politics of headquarters and language, and the use of scientific diplomacy to project soft power.\n\nBrief institutional chronology and governance changes\n- CIESM’s work was suspended during World War II. This interruption reflected the broader collapse of multinational scientific cooperation during major conflict.\n- During and after the war there was external pressure to transfer CIESM’s responsibilities to the United Nations — a common post‑war impulse to centralise international functions under the UN umbrella. Despite these proposals, CIESM’s members opted to revive the Commission as a regional, specialist body rather than merge it into a global UN institution.\n- Meetings resumed in 1951 in Paris, marking the organisation’s post‑war revival and a reassertion of regional scientific cooperation.\n- Historically, the seat of the Commission had been transferred to Paris in 1924; by the statutes dated 30 November 1970 the headquarters were recorded as being in Monaco. This shift in formal base (Paris → Monaco by 1970) signals changing practical and symbolic geographies of the organisation over time.\n- The 1970 statutes codified a number of governance rules: French was designated the official language; the plenary Congress would be convened every two years to decide the scientific subjects to be studied; and the president was to be elected for a four‑year term at the plenary Congress and Assembly, with eligibility for re‑election.\n\nLeadership, patronage and public profile\n- At the 15th CIESM Congress in Istanbul (1956) Monaco was elected to the presidency, represented by Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. The choice of Monaco and the personal association with a reigning prince conferred political visibility and principled patronage on the Commission.\n- Prof. Jean Furnestin served as Secretary General in the post‑war period and undertook substantial refoundation work, a process that continued until 1966. His stewardship was crucial for institutional reconstitution.\n- Commandant Jacques‑Yves Cousteau succeeded Furnestin as Secretary General in 1966. Cousteau’s global renown as a maritime explorer and communicator substantially raised CIESM’s public profile and outreach, illustrating how celebrity leadership can function as a form of scientific diplomacy and soft power.\n- Prof. François Doumenge led as Secretary General from 1988 until 2007, a long tenure that provided continuity during a period of expansion and modernization.\n- Around 2007 CIESM’s Council decided to merge the Secretary General and Director General positions — a structural reform signalling administrative modernisation and centralisation of executive functions.\n- Prof. Frédéric Briand occupied the now‑combined Director General role until September 2023. Dr. Laura Giuliano was elected and assumed the Director General position in September 2023.\n\nMembership evolution and statutory inclusions\n- A critical statute change permitted membership for non‑coastal countries that were active in marine research. This represented a deliberate shift from a strictly territorial/coastal conception of membership toward a merit‑ and research‑based criterion, opening the Commission to valuable scientific capacities regardless of geography.\n- Following that statute change, Germany joined the Commission in 1969 and Switzerland in 1970; Portugal joined later in 2004. These accession dates show gradual expansion beyond the original core of coastal Mediterranean states and reflect how scientific capability became an avenue to participation.\n- The retention of French as the official language (1970 statutes) underscores the enduring administrative and cultural influence of Francophone practice within the organisation.\n\nAnalytical implications for strategic culture and national security policy\n- Institutional resilience: CIESM demonstrates how regional scientific organisations can survive wartime suspension and resist incorporation into larger multilateral bodies by reasserting specialised mandates. For states shaping strategic culture, this suggests that specialist multilateral forums can be preserved and adapted to serve long‑term national and collective interests.\n- Scientific diplomacy and soft power: The election of Monaco (and the association with Rainier III) and the appointment of Jacques‑Yves Cousteau illustrate the deliberate use of political patronage and public personalities to enhance institutional visibility — a tool that states and small entities can leverage to amplify influence without coercive power.\n- Membership criteria and capability‑based inclusion: Allowing non‑coastal members transformed CIESM into a capability‑driven community. For national security policy, this highlights the value of scientific contributions as a pathway to multilateral influence, including for states whose strategic geographies do not neatly match organisational footprints.\n- Governance rhythm and executive centralisation: The biennial plenary Congress provided a steady mechanism for agenda‑setting, while the 2007 merger of executive positions reflects modern trends toward streamlined leadership for operational efficiency. These are governance choices with implications for responsiveness, accountability and the projection of institutional priorities.\n\nIn short, CIESM’s trajectory — wartime suspension and post‑war revival, contestation over UN absorption, relocation of seats, statutory reforms expanding membership, and the use of symbolic leadership — offers a concise exemplar of how specialised international organisations adapt politically and administratively. For analysts of strategic culture and national security, the Commission is instructive: scientific organisations can be instruments of diplomacy, repositories of expertise that alter access and influence, and laboratories for governance innovations that carry broader normative and practical lessons for states’ behaviour in multilateral arenas."

    "generated_section_content_md": "## Case study: The Mediterranean Science Commission (CIESM) — a model of multilateral marine science for regional security\n\nThe Mediterranean Science Commission (CIESM) offers a compact but instructive example of how a specialized multilateral scientific organisation can contribute to regional environmental security, policymaking and strategic awareness. Although geographically distant from South Asia, CIESM’s structure, outputs and operational practices are highly relevant to Indian strategic culture and national security policy where maritime domain awareness, environmental risk, and regional scientific diplomacy increasingly intersect.\n\nWhat CIESM is and how it works\n- CIESM is presented as the principal multilateral organisation dedicated to coordinated marine research in the Mediterranean basin. Its membership spans EU and non‑EU littoral states, giving it a genuinely regional character that facilitates cooperation across political divides.\n- The Commission operates through an expert network of scientists capable of rapid detection of ecosystem changes and of issuing alerts and advice to governments and stakeholders. Its reputation for neutrality enhances credibility with policymakers and resource managers.\n- CIESM’s principal mechanisms for knowledge production and transfer are Monographs, thematic reports, regular Congresses and expert research workshops that produce authoritative syntheses. These outputs serve both as scientific reference works and as tools for policy guidance.\n\nKey milestones and programmes\n- 1993 — CIESM responded to a request from the European Parliament with a detailed assessment of Marine Pollution in the Mediterranean. This episode illustrates the organisation’s ability to provide timely, policy‑relevant scientific assessment on request.\n- 1998 — CIESM began running focused research workshops that produce widely read monographs. These workshops are ongoing and constitute a deliberate mechanism for consensus building, capacity development and rapid synthesis of emerging issues.\n- 2013–2020 — JellyWatch: a high‑temporal‑resolution coastal monitoring programme running weekly surveys of jellyfish outbreaks across coastal waters from Morocco to the Black Sea. The programme demonstrates sustained coastal monitoring capacity and evidence of integrating broad observational networks (including potential citizen‑science contributions).\n- Seabed mapping — Beginning in the same era CIESM produced morphometric maps of the Mediterranean seabed using modern multibeam swath imagery. These maps are valuable for habitat mapping, resource management and improved bathymetric knowledge relevant to navigation, fisheries and underwater infrastructure.\n- Atlases and species monitoring — CIESM publishes Atlases documenting exotic fishes, crustaceans, molluscs and seaweeds, and continuously tracks status and migration routes of endangered taxa (sharks, rays, seabirds). The Atlases provide baseline distributional references that help prioritise conservation and management actions.\n\nThematic scope — representative topics addressed in CIESM outputs\n- Physical and geological features: marine volcanoes, submarine canyons, Messinian Salinity Crisis and deep‑water systems.\n- Connectivity and biogeography: marine connectivity, migration routes, and the continuous arrival of tropical invaders (predominantly Indo‑Pacific origin).\n- Biodiversity and invasions: documentation of invasive species (Lessepsian migrants via the Suez Canal), impacts on native communities and fisheries.\n- Ecosystem risks and change: ocean acidification, climatic change impacts, species extinctions, emergent pollutants.\n- Food webs and biotechnology: from marine viruses to whales, and advances in marine biotechnologies.\n- Socio‑ecological dimensions: social studies of fisheries and human uses of marine space.\n- Conservation innovations: concepts such as Marine Peace Parks and other governance tools.\n\nRecent Congresses (selected)\n- Venice (2010)\n- Marseille (2013)\n- Kiel (2016)\n- Cascais (2019)\n- Palermo (2024)\n\nOperational strengths and policy relevance\n- Neutrality and scientific credibility: CIESM’s neutral stance increases uptake of its assessments by policymakers and regional managers.\n- Multilateral reach: inclusion of both EU and non‑EU Mediterranean states facilitates regional coordination across political lines — an important precedent where geopolitical fragmentation could otherwise impede environmental management.\n- Rapid detection and early warning: the scientist network and programmatic surveillance (e.g., JellyWatch) demonstrate how sustained monitoring translates into early warning capacity for ecological hazards.\n- Applied products: monographs, Atlases and multibeam maps are directly usable in marine spatial planning, pollution mitigation, fisheries management and coastal resilience planning.\n- Capacity building and consensus: workshops and congresses operate as mechanisms for knowledge transfer, training and generation of consensus science that can underpin policy.\n\nLessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy\n- Science diplomacy and neutral expertise: India’s strategic culture would benefit from strengthening neutral, regional scientific institutions or partnerships (bilateral, plurilateral or within existing forums such as IORA) that can provide credible, apolitical advice on transboundary marine risks.\n- Maritime domain awareness beyond security: CIESM shows the strategic utility of integrated environmental monitoring (seabed mapping, biological surveillance, coastal time‑series) for non‑traditional security challenges — fisheries collapse, invasive species, harmful algal blooms and pollution — that nonetheless have direct national security implications.\n- Monitoring and early warning architectures: programmes modelled on JellyWatch point to the value of high‑frequency, distributed coastal monitoring (with space for citizen science) to detect ecosystem shifts that can affect livelihoods, coastal infrastructure and disaster risk management.\n- Managing invasive pathways: the Mediterranean’s Lessepsian colonisations via the Suez Canal underline how shipping and canals create biological invasion pathways. For India, attention to biosecurity in ports, ballast water management and regional information sharing is a strategic necessity.\n- Data and mapping for maritime claims and planning: multibeam morphometric mapping supports EEZ management, seabed resource assessment and maritime safety — all of which are components of maritime strategy and sovereignty.\n- Consensus processes: regular workshops and monographs that synthesize contested or complex science can reduce uncertainty in policymaking and build cross‑border confidence — a strategic asset in politically sensitive maritime environments.\n\nCaveat and next steps\n- The excerpt analysed here includes a header for “Main sectors of marine research currently investigated by the Mediterranean Science Commission” without listing those sectors. For operational replication or policy design, practitioners should consult CIESM’s full programme documents and recent monographs to identify current priority themes and methodological standards.\n\nConclusion\nCIESM exemplifies how a specialised multilateral scientific commission can generate high‑quality, policy‑relevant products, sustain monitoring that underpins early warning, and foster cross‑border cooperation. For Indian strategic planners, the Commission is a useful model of how scientific neutrality, sustained observation, and targeted synthesis can be marshalled to manage marine risks that have direct bearing on national security, economic resilience and regional diplomacy."

    "generated_section_content_md": "### The Mediterranean Science Commission (CIESM): institutional history, structure and relevance\n\nOrigins and institutional purpose  \nCIESM — the Commission Internationale pour l'Exploration Scientifique de la Méditerranée — was conceived at the Oceanographic Museum in Monaco in 1910. Its foundation reflects the classic rationale for regional scientific commissions: to pool expertise and resources across neighboring states for sustained, evidence-based study of a shared maritime environment. Over more than a century CIESM has evolved from a narrowly scientific club into a hybrid scientific–policy actor that links oceanography, environmental monitoring and regional maritime governance.\n\nGovernance, presidency and membership evolution  \nThe Commission combines a formal membership of states with a much wider network of contributing researchers. Its presidency is currently held by Monaco — symbolically and practically significant given Monaco’s maritime scientific profile — and represented by Albert II, Prince of Monaco. Membership has expanded episodically, reflecting wider geopolitical shifts: after the Cold War new members joined in 1992 (Croatia, Slovenia, Ukraine); the Russian Federation acceded in 2013; and Albania joined in December 2019. Today CIESM’s 23 Member States are: Albania, Algeria, Croatia, Cyprus, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Lebanon, Malta, Monaco, Morocco, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Syria, Tunisia, and Turkey.\n\nCongress rhythm and interruptions  \nTriennial Congresses are a central governance and knowledge‑exchange mechanism for CIESM. Since 1992 these congresses have been scheduled every three years; they serve both as scientific fora and as moments for setting Commission priorities and coordinating multinational projects. The COVID‑19 pandemic produced a notable disruption — producing a five‑year interruption in the usual triennial sequence — with the next Congress planned for Palermo in October 2024. Such interruptions illustrate both the resilience and vulnerability of international scientific collaboration to global crises.\n\nScientific architecture and networks  \nInternally, CIESM was reorganized in 1996 into six scientific committees to reflect an integrated, interdisciplinary approach to Mediterranean marine science. Those committees are:\n- Marine Geosciences  \n- Physics and Climate of the Ocean  \n- Marine Biogeochemistry  \n- Marine Microbiology and Biotechnology  \n- Marine Ecosystems and Living Resources  \n- Coastal Systems and Marine Policies\n\nThis configuration spans geophysical processes to living resources and policy interfaces, signaling an orientation toward applied science and governance relevance rather than pure academic inquiry alone. Beyond formal state members, the Commission relies on contributions from researchers in over 50 countries, indicating an extensive transnational scientific network that amplifies its technical capacity and regional reach.\n\nPartnerships and policy influence  \nCIESM maintains close operational links with a range of UN agencies and regional bodies: UNESCO (notably the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, IOC), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). It also collaborates with regional or “sister” organisations such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and UNEP’s Mediterranean Action Plan (UNEP/MAP). These partnerships allow CIESM to contribute technical expertise to multilateral environmental agreements, maritime safety initiatives and fisheries management, thereby converting scientific outputs into inputs for regional policy-making.\n\nAnalytical significance for strategic studies and India’s strategic culture  \nAlthough regionally focused on the Mediterranean, CIESM offers analytically useful lessons for study of maritime strategy and science diplomacy — topics central to India’s strategic culture and national security policy. First, CIESM exemplifies how scientific commissions can become instruments of soft power and norm formation: routine activities (congresses, joint projects, committee reports) build epistemic communities whose findings influence policy. Second, its mixed membership (Mediterranean states plus contributors from 50+ countries) shows how technical networks extend influence beyond formal treaty circles — a useful model for India’s outreach in the Indian Ocean region. Third, the Commission’s integration of natural science with coastal policy anticipates contemporary security concerns where environmental change, resource competition and maritime safety intersect. Finally, the resilience of CIESM’s arrangements (long institutional memory, regular congress rhythm, partnerships with UN bodies) offers practical design features for India when building or deepening regional scientific and security architectures: sustained periodic forums, interdisciplinary committees linked to policy, and formal links to global UN mechanisms.\n\nConcluding reflection  \nCIESM’s century‑long trajectory — from a 1910 initiative in Monaco to a modern commission with interdisciplinary committees and broad international partnerships — encapsulates how regional scientific organizations can become enduring infrastructure for both knowledge production and regional governance. For scholars of strategic culture, it highlights the capacity of science to shape maritime norms, to extend influence through expertise, and to furnish durable mechanisms that bridge states, scientists and international organizations. These are precisely the mechanisms India must understand and selectively emulate as it crafts maritime strategy and deepens cooperation across the Indian Ocean region."
