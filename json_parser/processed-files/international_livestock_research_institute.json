This image signals an institute engaged in active laboratory and field research based in Nairobi.\n\nOverview\n- Title/identifier: “Agricultural research institute” — ILRI exemplifies the class of international agricultural research centres that bring scientific expertise, policy engagement and development practice into dialogue with national agricultural priorities.\n- Organization name and affiliation: The International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) is one of the CGIAR Centres. CGIAR is a global research partnership devoted to reducing rural poverty, improving food security and nutrition, and ensuring sustainable management of natural resources.\n- Legal/organizational status: ILRI is constituted as a non-profit, non-governmental organisation operating within an international research partnership framework.\n\nFounding history and footprint\n- ILRI was established in 1994 by merging two predecessor institutions: the International Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases (ILRAD) based in Nairobi, Kenya, and the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The merger consolidated laboratory expertise and continent-wide programme capacity under a single CGIAR centre with headquarters in Nairobi.\n- The historical locations (Nairobi and Addis Ababa) reflect ILRI’s East African origins and its regional research footprint, while its CGIAR affiliation gives it a global remit and network.\n\nStated mission, operational goals and research scope\n- Stated mission (as reported in primary sources): ILRI’s research is aimed at “building sustainable livestock pathways out of poverty in low‑income countries.” Operational goals are conventionally expressed as three related objectives: keeping farm animals alive and productive; increasing and sustaining livestock and farm productivity; and finding profitable markets for animal products.\n  - Note on sourcing: some accounts of ILRI’s mission in public summaries carry tags questioning reliance on self-published or primary sources; for rigorous analysis these mission statements should be corroborated with independent secondary literature (peer‑reviewed studies, donor assessments, and multilateral evaluations).\n- Research scope: ILRI’s programme is typically organised around five broad thematic areas — the natural environment; food (safety and nutrition); gender (roles and equity in livestock systems); health (including zoonoses and animal health systems); and prosperity (livelihoods, markets and value chains).\n\nTypical activities and partnerships\n- Core activities include applied research, policy engagement, capacity building, and partnership with national governments, regional bodies, NGOs and the private sector. ILRI frequently works on livestock productivity, animal disease control (including zoonotic disease surveillance and mitigation), value‑chain development, climate resilience of pastoralist and mixed crop–livestock systems, and gendered aspects of livestock ownership and labor.\n- Funding model: like other CGIAR centres, ILRI is funded through a portfolio of multilateral donors, national government grants, philanthropic foundations, and competitive research grants. Exact funding mixes and accountability mechanisms vary over time and should be verified from independent budgetary and audit reports.\n\nCitation and quality concerns\n- Editorial note from the source material: an explicit maintenance template cautions that descriptions “rely excessively on references to primary sources” and recommends adding secondary/tertiary, independent sources to strengthen reliability.\n- Recommendation: strengthen any analytical use of ILRI materials by citing peer‑reviewed evaluations of CGIAR impacts, independent policy analyses, and assessments from multilateral agencies (e.g., FAO, World Bank) or reputable scholarly work on international agricultural research.\n\nImplications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy\nAlthough ILRI’s headquarters are in East Africa and its primary mission emphasises low‑income countries, its work has several direct and indirect implications for India’s strategic culture and national security calculus:\n\n- Food and nutrition security: Livestock contributes substantially to diets, livelihoods and rural resilience in India. Research on improving livestock productivity, feed systems, and post‑harvest value chains informs India’s efforts to secure protein supplies and rural incomes, a core aim of national food security policy.\n- Biosecurity and zoonotic disease preparedness: ILRI’s work on animal health and zoonoses (e.g., viral and bacterial pathogens that jump species) has clear resonance for India’s public health and national security planning. International collaboration on surveillance, diagnostics, and early warning contributes to India’s capacity to detect and respond to emerging biological threats.\n- Climate resilience and resource competition: Livestock systems are both affected by and contributors to climate variability. Research on adaptation for pastoralists and mixed systems informs India’s strategies to manage pastoral mobility, land use conflicts, water scarcity and human–animal competition — issues with domestic stability implications.\n- Rural stability and counter‑radicalisation: Enhancing rural livelihoods through livestock productivity and market access can be a stabilising element in border and marginalized regions. In India’s strategic culture, development of peripheral areas is tied to internal security and governance legitimacy.\n- Trade, value chains and economic statecraft: ILRI’s work on value chains and market access intersects with India’s trade interests in animal products, sanitary and phytosanitary standards, and export competitiveness. Technical cooperation and capacity building via international centres can be instruments of diplomatic engagement.\n- Science diplomacy and institutional collaboration: Engagement with CGIAR centres like ILRI is part of India’s broader science diplomacy portfolio. Collaborative research, joint capacity building and knowledge exchange strengthen India’s global research networks and provide leverage in multilateral fora that shape agricultural norms and funding priorities.\n\nPolicy recommendations (for analysts and policymakers)\n- Integrate livestock‑focused international research outputs into national biosecurity and public‑health planning. Use ILRI’s zoonoses research to inform One Health initiatives.\n- Promote reciprocal partnerships: encourage Indian public research institutions and universities to collaborate systematically with ILRI and other CGIAR centres to import relevant technologies and share India’s own experience in large‑scale livestock systems.\n- Demand independent evidence: when using ILRI materials in national policy, triangulate with peer‑reviewed studies, multilateral assessments and independent evaluations to avoid overreliance on organisational self‑reporting.\n- Leverage CGIAR cooperation for capacity building in India’s frontier and border regions where livestock systems intersect with national security concerns (e.g., pastoral mobility, livelihood support in remote districts).\n\nConcluding note\nILRI represents a specialised node in the global agricultural research architecture. For India, the institute’s thematic work — particularly on livestock productivity, zoonotic disease, climate adaptation and value chains — has tangible bearing on national objectives for food security, public health preparedness and rural stability. Analytical use of ILRI’s materials in the context of India’s strategic culture should be careful to incorporate independent secondary sources and to situate ILRI’s findings within national policy frameworks and institutional realities."
