Its members are the\nnations of Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. The Union has been\nunable to achieve tangible progress on its goals due to deep economic and\npolitical disagreements between Morocco and Algeria regarding, among others,\nthe issue of Western Sahara. No high-level meetings have taken place since 3\nJuly 2008, and commentators regard the Union as largely dormant."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The idea for an economic union of the Maghreb began with the independence of\nTunisia and Morocco in 1956. It was not until thirty years later, though, that\nfive Maghreb states\u2014Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, and Tunisia\u2014met for\nthe first Maghreb summit in 1988. The Union was established on 17 February\n1989 when the treaty was signed by the member states in Marrakech. According\nto the Constitutive Act, its aim is to guarantee cooperation \"with similar\nregional institutions... [to] take part in the enrichment of the international\ndialogue... [to] reinforce the independence of the member states and... [to]\nsafeguard... their assets.\" Strategic relevance of the region is based on the\nfact that, collectively, it boasts large phosphate, oil, and gas reserves, and\nit is a transit centre to southern Europe. The success of the Union would,\ntherefore, be economically important."

        "generated_section_content_md": "There have been problems of traditional rivalries within the AMU. For example,\nin 1994, Algeria decided to transfer the presidency of the AMU to Libya. This\nfollowed the diplomatic tensions between Algeria and other members, especially\nMorocco and Libya, whose leaders continuously refused to attend AMU meetings\nheld in Algiers. Algerian officials justified the decision, arguing that they\nwere simply complying with the AMU Constitutive Act, which stipulates that the\npresidency should in fact rotate on an annual basis. Algeria agreed to take\nover the presidency from Tunisia in 1994, but could not transfer it due to the\nabsence of all required conditions to relinquish the presidency as stipulated\nby the Constitutive Act.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the decision to transfer the presidency of the\nUnion, the Libyan leader, Muammar Gaddafi, stated that it was time to put the\nUnion \"in the freezer\". This raised questions about Libya's position towards\nthe Union. The concern was that Libya would have a negative influence on the\nmanner in which it would preside over the organization.\n\nMoreover, traditional rivalries between Morocco and Algeria, and the unsolved\nquestion of Western Sahara's sovereignty, have blocked union meetings since\nthe early 1990s despite several attempts to re-launch the political process.\nWestern Sahara, a former Spanish colony that was invaded by Morocco and\nMauritania, has declared independence as the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic.\nThe latest top-level conference, in mid-2005, was derailed by Morocco's\nrefusal to meet, due to Algeria's vocal support for Sahrawi independence.\nAlgeria has continuously supported the Polisario Front liberation movement.\n\nSeveral attempts have been made, notably by the United Nations, to resolve the\nWestern Sahara issue. In mid-2003, the UN Secretary General's Personal Envoy,\nJames Baker, proposed a settlement plan, also referred to as the Baker Plan\nII. The UN's proposal was rejected by Morocco and accepted by the Sahrawi Arab\nDemocratic Republic. As far as bilateral attempts are concerned, very little\nhas been achieved, as Morocco continues to refuse any concessions that would\nallow the independence of Western Sahara, while Algeria maintains its support\nfor the self-determination of the Sahrawis.\n\nIn addition, the quarrel between Gaddafi's Libya and Mauritania has not made\nthe task of reinvigorating the organization any easier. Mauritania has accused\nthe Libyan secret service of being involved in a 2003 attempted coup against\nPresident Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya. Libya has denied all the accusation.\n\nIn 2023, the single currency project in the area remains technically feasible\nbut politically infeasible.\n\nIn April 2024, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya discuss the establishment of a new\nNorth African entity, supposed to replace the Arab Maghreb Union, which they\nconsider \"inoperative\", without Morocco, and Mauritania. It was decided that\njoint working groups will be created to coordinate efforts on the security of\ncommon borders in the face of irregular migration and the establishment of\nmajor joint investment projects on cereal production as well as water\ndesalination of sea water in the face of climate change, and the free movement\nof goods and people between the three countries.\n\nIn November 2024, Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune invited Kais Saied,\nPresident of Tunisia, Mohamed Ould Ghazouani, President of Mauritania, Mohamed\nal-Menfi, President of the Libyan Presidential Council, and Ibrahim Ghali,\nPresident of the Sahrawi Republic, to attend the celebration of the 70th\nanniversary of the outbreak of the Declaration of 1 November 1954. This\nmeeting is seen as the beginning of a new union with the notable absence of\nMorocco and Mauritania.\n\nA third tripartite summit between Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria is being held in\nTripoli in January 2025."
