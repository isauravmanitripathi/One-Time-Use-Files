It\nfocuses on giving civil society a stronger voice, promoting human rights, and\nmaking sure that all groups can take part in democratic processes. Through the\nFund, the Office gave money to almost 600 projects in more than 130 countries\naround the world. These projects ranged from helping women and young people\nget involved in civil society to media programs that let civil society get its\nmessage out.[_citation needed_]"

        "generated_section_content_md": "The United Nations Democracy Fund was established during the 2005 World Summit\nas a United Nations General Trust Fund and launched in April 2006, with the\nUnited Nations Office for Partnerships (UNFIP) providing administrative\nsupport and resource-sharing. Since then, it has become clear that the group\nthat gives grants is a fund for civil society organizations. It is the only\nUnited Nations entity that has the word \u201cdemocracy\u201d in its name, the only\nUnited Nations body with the primary purpose of supporting democracy through\nempowering civil society, and one of the youngest entities in the United\nNations system. Most project money goes to local civil society groups in\ncountries that are both in the \"transition\" phase of democratization and in\nthe \"consolidation\" phase. By supporting the \"demand\" side of democratization\ninstead of the \"supply\" side, the Fund plays a huge role by making a\ndifferent, unique role that enhances and complements the traditional work of\nthe United Nations, which is working with governments, to strengthen\ndemocratic governance around the world.\n\nA key part of the Fund\u2019s mission is to ensure that all levels of government\nare accountable to those they serve by increasing the knowledge, capacity,\nvoice, and reach of citizen organizations. With the adoption of the 2030\nAgenda for Sustainable Development in September 2015, the Fund agreed to give\npriority to projects that, among other things, hold governments accountable\nfor meeting the Sustainable Development Goals.[_citation needed_]"
