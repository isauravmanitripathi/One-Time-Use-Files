        "generated_section_content_md": "The **Central European Initiative** or **CEI** , is the largest and oldest\nforum of regional cooperation in Central, Eastern and South Eastern Europe. It\nnow counts 17 member states, based on region and democratic values: Albania,\nBelarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic,\nHungary, Italy, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Serbia,\nSlovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine. The origin of the Central European Initiative\nlies in the creation of what was then known as the Quadragonale in Budapest on\n11 November 1989 whose founding members were Italy, Austria, Hungary and the\nSocialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY). The conjunction with the fall\nof the Berlin Wall was a coincidence, yet the CEI has been involved in\ndemocratizing Eastern European countries after the Soviet Bloc dissolved.\n\nThe Initiative aimed at overcoming the division in blocks by re-establishing\ncooperation links, among countries of different political orientations and\neconomic structures. This was largely headed by Italy, who at the time, wanted\ngreater involvement in supporting Eastern European countries in order to rival\na newly reunited Germany.\n\nAt the first Summit in Venice in 1990, Czechoslovakia was admitted and the\nInitiative was renamed Pentagonale. In 1991, with the admission of Poland it\nbecame the Hexagonale.\n\nThe organization was renamed Central European Initiative (CEI) from the\nHexagonale in 1992, and has held the name since. On the same occasion,\nMacedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Slovenia were admitted as\nmember states. That year, Yugoslavia's recognition ceased, due to a violent\nbreak ups of the nation and the recognition of Croatia and Slovakia as\nindependent nations. The Czech Republic and Slovakia were admitted to the CEI\nin 1993 following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. In 1996, Albania,\nBelarus, Bulgaria, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine joined the CEI as full-fledged\nmembers.\n\nIn recent years the CEI has focused on expanding healthcare access within its\n17 member states. It has partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to\nfocus on preventing unwanted consequences from the pandemic and the sharing of\nhealth information. They have met regularly since this partnership was founded\nin June of 2022, with the most recent meeting happening November 2024. In the\nlatest meeting, the organizations focused on health in the Western Balkans,\nimplementing focus on integration following the EU model."
