SICA's General Secretariat is in El Salvador.\n\nIn 1991, SICA's institutional framework included Guatemala, El Salvador,\nHonduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama. Belize joined in 1998 as a full\nmember, while the Dominican Republic became an associated state in 2004 and a\nfull member in 2013. Mexico, Chile and Brazil became part of the organization\nas regional observers, and the Republic of China, Spain, Germany, Georgia and\nJapan became extra-regional observers. SICA has a standing invitation to\nparticipate as observers in sessions of the United Nations General Assembly,\nand maintains offices at UN Headquarters.\n\nFour countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Nicaragua) experiencing\npolitical, cultural and migratory integration have formed a group, the Central\nAmerica Four or CA-4, which has introduced common internal borders and the\nsame type of passport. Belize, Costa Rica, Panama and the Dominican Republic\nsubsequently joined the CA-4 for economic integration."

The five nations, all former Spanish colonies, had previously\ntried to form a political alliance. Their first attempt was the Federal\nRepublic of Central America, and the most recent effort was the founding of\nthe Republic of Central America 11 years earlier.\n\nThe participants concluded the conference with an agreement creating the\nCentral American Court of Justice _(Corte de Justicia Centroamericana)_. The\ncourt would remain in effect for ten years from the final ratification, and\ncommunication would be through the government of Costa Rica. It was composed\nof five judges, one from each member state. The court heard ten cases, five of\nwhich were brought by private individuals (and declared inadmissible) and\nthree begun by the court. The court operated until April 1918 from its\nheadquarters in Costa Rica; despite efforts beginning in March 1917 (when\nNicaragua submitted a notice of termination of the agreement), it then\ndissolved.\n\nReasons for the agreement's failure include:\n\n* No effective system of judicial procedure\n* Judges were not independent of their respective governments.\n* Jurisdiction was too broad to satisfy its member states.[_citation needed_]\n\nExclusive Economic Zones of the member states of the Central American\nIntegration System. Considering them, the total area reaches 2 351 224 km\u00b2."

On 14 October 1951 (33 years after the CACJ was dissolved)\nthe governments of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua\nsigned a treaty creating the Organization of Central American States\n_(Organizaci\u00f3n de Estados Centroamericanos_ , or ODECA) to promote regional\ncooperation and unity. The following year (12 December 1952), ODECA's charter\nwas amended to create a new Central American Court of Justice (_Corte\nCentroamericana de Justicia_ , or CCJ) without the time limit of its previous\nincarnation.\n\nThe Charter of San Salvador was ratified by all Central American governments,\nand on 18 August 1955 their foreign ministers attended its first meeting in\nAntigua Guatemala. The Declaration of Antigua Guatemala authorized subordinate\norganizations of ODECA to facilitate economic cooperation, better sanitation\nand progress in the \"integral union\" of the Central American nations.\n\nThe Central American Common Market, the Central American Bank for Economic\nIntegration (BCIE) and the Secretariat for Central American Economic\nIntegration (SIECA) were established by the five Central American nations on\n13 December 1960 at a conference in Managua. All nations ratified the\nmembership treaties the following year. Costa Rica joined the CACM in 1963,\nbut Panama had not yet joined. The organization froze during the 1969 war\nbetween Honduras and El Salvador; in 1973 ODECA was suspended, and progress\ntoward regional integration ground to a halt."

SICA was\nsupported by the United Nations General Assembly in a resolution of 20\nDecember 1993. SICA includes seven Central America nations and the Dominican\nRepublic, which is part of the Caribbean. Central America has several\nsupranational institutions, such as the Central American Parliament, the\nCentral American Bank for Economic Integration and the Central American Common\nMarket. The Central America trade bloc is governed by the General Treaty for\nEconomical Integration (the Guatemala Protocol), which was signed on 29\nOctober 1993. The CACM has removed duties on most products throughout the\nmember countries, and has unified external tariffs and increased trade within\nits members. The bank has five non-regional members: Argentina, Colombia,\nMexico, the Republic of China and Spain.\n\nAll SICA members are also part of the Mesoamerica Project, which includes\nMexico and Colombia.
