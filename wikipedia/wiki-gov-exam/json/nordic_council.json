Formed in 1952, it has 87\nrepresentatives from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden as well as\nfrom the autonomous areas of the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and \u00c5land. The\nrepresentatives are members of parliament in their respective countries or\nareas and are elected by those parliaments. The Council holds ordinary\nsessions each year in October/November and usually one extra session per year\nwith a specific theme. The council's official languages are Danish, Finnish,\nIcelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish, though it uses only the mutually\nintelligible Scandinavian languages\u2014Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish\u2014as its\nworking languages. These three comprise the first language of around 80% of\nthe region's population and are learned as a second or foreign language by the\nremaining 20%.\n\nIn 1971, the Nordic Council of Ministers, an intergovernmental forum, was\nestablished to complement the council. The Council and the Council of\nMinisters are involved in various forms of cooperation with neighbouring areas\nin Northern Europe, including the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, the\nBenelux countries and the Baltic states."

        "generated_section_content_md": "During World War II, Denmark and Norway were occupied by Germany; Finland was\nunder assault by the Soviet Union; while Sweden, though neutral, still felt\nthe war's effects. Following the war, the Nordic countries pursued the idea of\na Scandinavian defence union to ensure their mutual defence. However, Finland,\ndue to its Paasikivi\u2013Kekkonen policy of neutrality and FCMA treaty with the\nUSSR, could not participate.\n\nIt was proposed that the Nordic countries would unify their foreign policy and\ndefence, remain neutral in the event of a conflict and not ally with NATO,\nwhich some were planning at the time. The United States, keen on getting\naccess to bases in Scandinavia and believing the Nordic countries incapable of\ndefending themselves, stated it would not ensure military support for\nScandinavia if they did not join NATO. As Denmark and Norway sought US aid for\ntheir post-war reconstruction, the project collapsed, with Denmark, Norway and\nIceland joining NATO as founding members. Finland and Sweden joined NATO in\n2023 and 2024, respectively, following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFurther Nordic co-operation, such as an economic customs union, also failed.\nThis led Danish Prime Minister Hans Hedtoft to propose, on 13 August 1951, a\nconsultative interparliamentary body. This proposal was agreed by Denmark,\nIceland, Norway, and Sweden during a meeting in Copenhagen on 15\u201316 March\n1952. The council's first session was held in the Danish Parliament on 13\nFebruary 1953 and it elected Hans Hedtoft as its president. When Finnish-\nSoviet relations thawed following the death of Joseph Stalin, Finland joined\nthe council in 1955, following a voting in the Parliament of Finland on 28\nOctober that year, effective from 23 December the same year.\n\nOn 2 July 1954, the Nordic labour market was created and in 1958, building\nupon a 1952 passport-free travel area, the Nordic Passport Union was created.\nThese two measures helped ensure Nordic citizens' free movement around the\narea. A Nordic Convention on Social Security was implemented in 1955. There\nwere also plans for a single market but they were abandoned in 1959 shortly\nbefore Denmark, Norway, and Sweden joined the European Free Trade Area (EFTA).\nFinland became an associated member of EFTA in 1961 and Denmark and Norway\napplied to join the European Economic Community (EEC).\n\nThis move towards the EEC led to desire for a formal Nordic treaty. The\nHelsinki Treaty outlined the workings of the council and came into force on 24\nMarch 1962. Further advancements on Nordic cooperation were made in the\nfollowing years: a Nordic School of Public Health, a Nordic Cultural Fund, and\nNordic House in Reykjav\u00edk were created. Danish Prime Minister Hilmar\nBaunsgaard proposed full economic cooperation (\"Nordek\") in 1968. Nordek was\nagreed in 1970, but Finland then backtracked, stating that its ties with the\nSoviet Union meant it could not form close economic ties with potential\nmembers of the EEC (Denmark and Norway). Nordek was then abandoned.\n\nAs a consequence, Denmark and Norway applied to join the EEC and the Nordic\nCouncil of Ministers was set up in 1971 to ensure continued Nordic\ncooperation. In 1970 representatives of the Faroe Islands and \u00c5land were\nallowed to take part in the Nordic Council as part of the Danish and Finnish\ndelegations. Norway turned down EEC membership in 1972 while Denmark acted as\na bridge builder between the EEC and the Nordics. Also in 1973, although it\ndid not opt for full membership of the EEC, Finland negotiated a free trade\ntreaty with the EEC that in practice removed customs duties from 1977 on,\nalthough there were transition periods up to 1985 for some products. Sweden\ndid not apply due to its non-alliance policy, which was aimed at preserving\nneutrality. Greenland subsequently left the EEC and has since sought a more\nactive role in circumpolar affairs.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Nordic Council founded the Nordic Industrial Fund, Nordtest\nand the Nordic Investment Bank. The council's remit was also expanded to\ninclude environmental protection and, in order to clean up the pollution in\nthe Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, a joint energy network was established.\nThe Nordic Science Policy Council was set up in 1983 and, in 1984,\nrepresentatives from Greenland were allowed to join the Danish delegation.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Nordic Council began\nto cooperate more with the Baltic states and new Baltic Sea organisations.\nSweden and Finland joined the European Union (EU), the EEC's successor, in\n1995. Norway had also applied, but once again voted against membership.\nHowever, Norway and Iceland did join the European Economic Area (EEA) which\nintegrated them economically with the EU. The Nordic Passport Union was also\nsubsumed into the EU's Schengen Area in 1996.\n\nThe Nordic Council became more outward-looking, to the Arctic, Baltic, Europe,\nand Canada. The \u00d8resund Bridge linking Sweden and Denmark led to a large\namount of cross-border travel, which in turn led to further efforts to reduce\nbarriers. However, the initially envisioned tasks and functions of the Nordic\nCouncil have become partially dormant due to the significant overlap with the\nEU and EEA. In 2008 Iceland began EU membership talks, but decided to annul\nthese in 2015. Unlike the Benelux, there is no explicit provision in the\nTreaty on European Union that takes into account Nordic co-operation. However,\nthe Treaties provide that international agreements concluded by the Member\nStates before they become members of the Union remain valid, even if they are\ncontrary to the provisions of Union law. However, each Member State must take\nall necessary measures to eliminate any discrepancies as quickly as possible.\nNordic co-operation can therefore in practice only be designed to the extent\nthat it complies with Union law."

The Council refers to Danish,\nNorwegian, and Swedish collectively as Scandinavian and considers them to be\ndifferent forms of the same language forming a common language community.\nSince 1987, under the Nordic Language Convention, citizens of the Nordic\ncountries have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting\nwith official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any\ninterpretation or translation costs. The Convention covers visits to\nhospitals, job centres, the police, and social security offices. The languages\nincluded are Danish, Finnish, Icelandic, Norwegian, and Swedish.\n\nOn 31 October 2018, the council established it has five official languages,\ngiving Finnish and Icelandic equal status with Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish\nfrom 1 January 2020 onward. While the working languages of the council's\nsecretariat remain the three Scandinavian languages, the Council emphasised\nthat the secretariat must include personnel with comprehensive understanding\nof Finnish and Icelandic as well. The then-President of the Council Michael\nTetzschner thought the compromise good but also expressed concern over the\nchange's expenses and hoped they would not increase so much that there would\nbe pressure to switch over to using English."

Visitors from the\nBaltic States and Northwest Russia are those who mostly take up this\nopportunity. Guests who have a connection to the theme under discussion are\ninvited to the Theme Session.\"\n\nThe Nordic Council of Ministers has established four _Offices outside the\nNordic Region_ : In Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the German state of\nSchleswig-Holstein. The offices form part of the secretariat of the Nordic\nCouncil of Ministers; according to the Council of Ministers their primary\nmission is to promote cooperation between the Nordic countries and the Baltic\nstates and to promote the Nordic countries in cooperation with their embassies\nwithin the Baltic states.\n\nThe Nordic Council and the Council of Ministers also define Estonia, Latvia,\nLithuania, and Russia as \"Adjacent Areas\" and has formal cooperation with them\nunder the Adjacent Areas policies framework.\n\nThe Nordic Council had historically been a strong supporter of Baltic\nindependence from the Soviet Union. During the move towards independence in\nthe Baltic States in 1991, Denmark and Iceland pressed for the Observer Status\nin the Nordic Council for the then-nonsovereign Estonia, Latvia, and\nLithuania. The move in 1991 was opposed by Norway and Finland. The move was\nheavily opposed by the Soviet Union, accusing the Nordic Council of getting\ninvolved in its internal affairs. In the same year, the Nordic Council refused\nto give observer status for the three, at the time nonsovereign, Baltic\nstates.\n\nWhile the Nordic Council rejected the Baltic states' application for formal\nobserver status, the council nevertheless has extensive cooperation on\ndifferent levels with all neighbouring countries, including the Baltic states\nand Germany, especially the state of Schleswig-Holstein. Representatives of\nSchleswig-Holstein were present as informal guests during a session for the\nfirst time in 2016. The state has historical ties to Denmark and cross-border\ncooperation with Denmark and has a Danish minority population. As\nparliamentary representatives from Schleswig-Holstein, a member of the South\nSchleswig Voter Federation and a member of the Social Democrats with ties to\nthe Danish minority were elected.\n\nThe S\u00e1mi political structures long desired formal representation in the Nordic\nCouncil's structures, and were eventually granted observer status through the\nS\u00e1mi Parliamentary Council. In addition, representatives of the S\u00e1mi people\nare de facto included in activities touching upon their interests. In\naddition, the Faroe Islands have expressed their wishes for full membership in\nthe Nordic Council instead of the current associate membership.\n\nThree of the members of the Nordic Council (Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, all\nEU member states), the Baltic Assembly, and the Benelux sought intensifying\ncooperation in the Digital Single Market, as well as discussing social\nmatters, the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union, the European\nmigrant crisis and defense cooperation. Foreign relations in the wake of\nRussia's annexation of Crimea and the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum\nwere also on the agenda.\n\nFollowing the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, the Finnish member of\nParliament Mikko K\u00e4rn\u00e4 announced he would launch an initiative at the Nordic\ncouncil to grant Scotland observer status. Scotland's relationship with the\nNordics has also been explored by Scottish journalist Anthony Heron, who would\ngo on to interview Bertel Haarder on the topic."
