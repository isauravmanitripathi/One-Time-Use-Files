        "generated_section_content_md": "OCCAR was established on 12 November 1996 by the Defence Ministers of France,\nGermany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Legal status was not achieved, however,\nuntil January 2001 when the parliaments of the four founding states ratified\nthe OCCAR Convention. Other European nations may join OCCAR, subject to their\nactual involvement in a substantive collaborative equipment programme\ninvolving at least one OCCAR partner and ratification of the OCCAR Convention.\nBelgium and Spain joined the organisation in respectively 2003 and 2005.\n\nOther states can participate to OCCAR programmes without becoming a member\nstate. Currently the European Union member states and/or NATO members Turkey,\nNetherlands, Luxembourg, Finland, Sweden, Lithuania and Poland participate in\none or more OCCAR programmes without being formal members. Australia also\nparticipates in OCCAR as a non-member with a focus on the Boxer, Tiger ARH and\nMU-90 Impact platforms.\n\nIn 2023 Australia became the first non-European country to act as a\nparticipating state as part of OCCAR when it signed onto the MU-90 In-service\nsupport program. In November 2023 the Netherlands voiced its intention to join\nOCCAR."
