The\norganization is one of the most widely known and visible social welfare\nentities globally, operating in 192 countries and territories. UNICEF's\nactivities include providing immunizations and disease prevention,\nadministering treatment for children and mothers with HIV, enhancing childhood\nand maternal nutrition, improving sanitation, promoting education, and\nproviding emergency relief in response to disasters.\n\nUNICEF is the successor of the United Nations International Children's\nEmergency Fund, and was created on 11 December 1946, in New York, by the U.N.\nRelief Rehabilitation Administration to provide immediate relief to children\nand mothers affected by World War II. The same year, the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly established UNICEF to further institutionalize post-war\nrelief work. In 1950, its mandate was extended to address the long-term needs\nof children and women, particularly in developing countries. In 1953, the\norganization became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and its\nname was changed to United Nations Children's Fund, though it retains the\nUNICEF acronym.\n\nUNICEF relies entirely on voluntary contributions from governments and private\ndonors. Its total income as of 2024 was $8.61 billion, of which public-sector\npartners contributed $4.92 billion. It is governed by a 36-member executive\nboard that establishes policies, approves programs, and oversees\nadministrative and financial plans. The board is made up of government\nrepresentatives elected by the United Nations Economic and Social Council,\nusually for three-year terms.\n\nUNICEF's programs emphasize developing community-level services to promote the\nhealth and well-being of children. Most of its work is in the field, with a\nnetwork that includes 150 country offices, headquarters and other facilities,\nand 34 \"national committees\" that carry out its mission through programs\ndeveloped with host governments. Seven regional offices provide technical\nassistance to country offices as needed, while its Supply Division\u2014based in\nthe cities of Copenhagen and New York\u2014helps provide over $3 billion in\ncritical aid and services.\n\nIn 2018, UNICEF assisted in the birth of 27 million babies, administered\npentavalent vaccines to an estimated 65.5 million children, provided education\nfor 12 million children, treated four million children with severe acute\nmalnutrition, and responded to 285 humanitarian emergencies in 90 countries.\nUNICEF has received recognition for its work, including the Nobel Peace Prize\nin 1965, the Indira Gandhi Prize in 1989 and the Princess of Asturias Award in\n2006. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, UNICEF, along with the World Health\nOrganization and other agencies, published guidance about healthy parenting."

He also proposed a \"health tax\" paid by member\nstates.\n\nAt the 1948 dissolution of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation\nAdministration (UNRRA), Rajchman proposed to use its residual funds for a\nchild-feeding program beneficiary of US funding. The organization was created\nby resolution 57(I) of the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 1946\nand named United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). As\nits first chairman, Rajchman chose Maurice Pate of the Commission for Relief\nin Belgium to direct the agency and \"to think about organizing an action, a\nfund for the benefit of children, war victims chiefly.\" Rajchman, as head of a\nspecial UN subcommittee and with the support of La Guardia, Herbert Hoover and\nMaurice Pate, presented the resolution to the General assembly. From a\ntemporary emergency relief agency in 1946 providing food and clothing to\nchildren and mothers displaced by World War II, the agency became a permanent\nUN Organization in 1953, and extended its efforts toward general programs of\nchildren welfare."

This prompted the agency to say, \"it is the first time in Unicef's\nhistory that a commercial entity has purposely set out to capitalize on one of\nour campaigns and subsequently damage an income stream which several of our\nprograms for children are dependent on\".

Frequent flyers can also redeem their mile points to donate.\nNorman Gillespie, UNICEF Australia's chief executive, said \"If every Qantas\npassenger traveling domestically gave us just a few of their forgotten coins\neach time they traveled it would make little difference to their day, but a\nworld of difference in saving children's lives.\""

UNICEF has\nhistorically opposed the creation of large-scale, permanent orphanages for\nchildren, preferring instead to find children places in their (extended)\nfamilies and communities, wherever possible. This has led UNICEF to be\nskeptical of international adoption efforts as a solution to child care\nproblems in developing countries; UNICEF has preferred to see children cared\nfor in their birth countries rather than be adopted by foreign parents.\n\nA 2013 article in _U.S. News& World Report_ magazine asserted UNICEF's\nintervention that on giving large cash payments to developing countries can\nlead to a cessation of international adoptions until all of its\nrecommendations are in place, and have even labelled UNICEF a \"villain\" for\nthe extent of its negative impact on orphans."
