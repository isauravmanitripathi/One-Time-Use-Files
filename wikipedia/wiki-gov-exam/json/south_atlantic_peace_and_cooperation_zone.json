Particular attention was dedicated\nto the question of preventing the geographical proliferation of nuclear\nweapons and of reducing and eventually eliminating the military presence of\ncountries from other regions.\n\nA Declaration on the denuclearization of the South Atlantic region was adopted\nat a meeting of member states held in Bras\u00edlia in September 1994. The U.N.\nGeneral Assembly endorsed the initiative, albeit with opposition from the\nUnited States, United Kingdom and France.\n\nThe South Atlantic itself is currently not a nuclear-weapon-free zone but all\nmember states are currently signatories of international treaties that\nprohibit nuclear weapons, namely the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty\nand the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the\nCaribbean. However, several Mid-Atlantic Ridge islands, the British overseas\nterritory of Saint Helena and its dependencies Ascension Island and Tristan da\nCunha, and Norway's Bouvet Island are not covered by those treaties. However,\nthe British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and\nthe South Sandwich Islands are covered by these treaties."
