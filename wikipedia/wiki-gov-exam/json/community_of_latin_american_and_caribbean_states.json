It is seen as an alternative to the\nOrganization of American States (OAS), and includes all OAS member states\n(except the United States and Canada) plus includes the nations of Nicaragua\nand Cuba. Initially proposed on February 23, 2010, at the Rio Group\u2013Caribbean\nCommunity Unity Summit, CELAC is seen as the successor of the Rio Group and\nthe Latin American and Caribbean Summit on Integration and Development (CALC).\nCELAC was created to deepen Latin American integration and to reduce hegemony\nwithin the politics and economics of the region. The date of creation was on\nDecember 3, 2011, in Caracas, Venezuela, with the signing of the Declaration\nof Caracas."

Formed in 1986, it\ngathered 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries around summits to cooperate\nregional policy issue independently of the United States.\n\nOn 16\u201317 December 2008, the I Latin American and Caribbean Summit on\nIntegration and Development (CALC) took place in Costa do Sauipe, Bahia,\nBrazil. It was organized at the initiative of the Lula administration with the\ngoal of building cooperation mechanism with greater autonomy from the United\nStates and Canada. Most heads of state from Latin America and the Caribbean\nstates attended, with the exception of President of Colombia \u00c1lvaro Uribe and\nPresident of Peru Alan Garc\u00eda. The summit finished with the signing of the\nBahia Declaration, a common agenda establishing the following priorities:\ncooperation between mechanism of regional and subregional integration, the\n2008 financial crisis, energy, infrastructures, social development and\neradication of hunger and poverty, food security, sustainable development,\nnatural disasters, human rights promotion, migration, South\u2013South cooperation\nand Latin America and Caribbean projection.\n\nIn 2008, the Calder\u00f3n administration of Mexico proposed the creation of the\nLatin American and the Caribbean Union (Spanish: _Uni\u00f3n Latinoamericana y del\nCaribe_ , ULC). The proposal was formalized on 27 March 2009 at Rio Group\nmeeting. At the initiative of Mexico, the XXI Rio Summit and the II CALC\nsummit were held together on 22\u201323 February 2010 in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.\nThe joint summit was named the Latin American and Caribbean Unity Summit and\nthe 33 attending states decided to create the Community of Latin American and\nCaribbean States (CELAC), which would be formally established in 2011.\n\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Rafael Correa were among the other\nprominent left-wing leaders who praised the creation of CELAC. In July 2010,\nCELAC selected President of Venezuela Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and President of Chile\nSebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, as co-chairs of the forum to draft statutes for the\norganization.\n\nThe announcement prompted debate and discussion across Latin America and the\nCaribbean about whether it was more beneficial to have close ties with the\nU.S. and Canada or to work independently.\n\nAn editorial in Brazil's _Estad\u00e3o_ newspaper said, \"CELAC reflects the\ndisorientation of the region's governments in relation to its problematic\nenvironment and its lack of foreign policy direction, locked as it is into the\nillusion that snubbing the United States will do for Latin American\nintegration what 200 years of history failed to do.\""

        "generated_section_content_md": "CELAC's inaugural summit was due to be held in mid-2011, but was postponed\nbecause of the ill-health of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, president of the host nation,\nVenezuela. The summit was instead held on December 2 and 3, 2011, in Caracas.\nIt primarily focused on the global economic crisis and its effects on the\nregion. Several leaders, including presidents Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner,\nDilma Rousseff and Juan Manuel Santos, encouraged an increase in regional\ntrade, economic development, and further economic cooperation among members in\norder to defend their growing economies.\n\nCh\u00e1vez, and other leaders such as Rafael Correa and Daniel Ortega, expressed\nhope that the bloc would work to further Latin American integration, end U.S.\nhegemony and consolidate control over regional affairs. Ch\u00e1vez, citing the\nMonroe Doctrine as the original confirmation of U.S. interference in the\nregion, openly called for CELAC to replace the OAS: \"As the years go by, CELAC\nis going to leave behind the old and worn-out OAS.\" Correa called for a new\nhuman rights commission to replace the Inter-American Commission on Human\nRights. Other leaders argued that the organisation should be used as a tool to\nresolve regional disagreements and uphold democratic values, but not as a\nreplacement of the OAS. Santos stated that he would like to see dialogue\nwithin the group over whether existing counter-drug regulations should be\nrevised. The president of the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) said he\nexpects that Parlatino will become the main legislative institution of CELAC.\nAmongst the key issues on the agenda were the creation of a \"new financial\narchitecture,\" sanction for maintaining the legal status of coca in Bolivia\nand the rejection of the Cuban embargo by the U.S.\n\nUnited States President Barack Obama's senior adviser on Latin America, Daniel\nRestrepo, informed reporters from Miami that the U.S. government would \"watch\nand see what direction CELAC takes\".\n\nBrazil decided to suspend its participation in the Community of Latin American\nand Caribbean States in January 2020 under the administration of Jair\nBolsonaro. Following the 2022 Brazilian general election, newly elected\npresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva signalled his intention to rejoin the\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, and effectively did so in\nthe first days of his administration.\n\nIn June 2023, CELAC recognized the Latin American and Caribbean character of\nthe island of Puerto Rico and \u201ccalls on the UN General Assembly to examine the\nquestion of Puerto Rico in its entirety and in all its aspects, and rule on\nthis matter as soon as possible\u201d.[1]."

It also states which countries\nhave been developing the best and how they are doing it in order for them to\nbe a model for other countries.\n\nThe issue of poverty was widely discussed. Cuba's Ra\u00fal Castro pointed out that\nthroughout Latin America and the Caribbean, people wanted a fairer\ndistribution of wealth, access to affordable education, employment, better\nsalaries, and the eradication of illiteracy.
