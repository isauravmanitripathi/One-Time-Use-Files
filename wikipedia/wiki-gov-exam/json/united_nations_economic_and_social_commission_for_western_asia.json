The report was officially\nwithdrawn and removed from UN websites after criticism from the Secretary-\nGeneral who said it had been issued by ESCWA without approval.\n\nThe document was co-authored by Richard Falk, professor of International Law\nand Practice Emeritus at Princeton University and a former UN human rights\ninvestigator for the Palestinian territories, and Virginia Tilley, professor\nof Political Science at Southern Illinois University. It criticised Israel's\nlaw of return for Jews. Falk and Tilley wrote: \"Israel defends its rejection\nof the Palestinians' return in frankly racist language: alleging that\nPalestinians constitute a 'demographic threat' and that their return would\nalter the demographic character of Israel to the point of eliminating it as a\nJewish state\".\n\nRima Khalaf, United Nations Under-Secretary-General and Executive Secretary of\nESCWA, had said it was the first to accuse Israel of being a racist state\nwhich had established an apartheid system. The report itself said it had\nestablished on the \"basis of scholarly inquiry and overwhelming evidence, that\nIsrael is guilty of the crime of apartheid\". Israel has condemned the report.\n\"We expected of course that Israel and its allies would put huge pressure on\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations so that he would disavow the\nreport, and that they would ask him to withdraw it,\" Khalaf said to AFP.\n\nUN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres distanced himself from the report and\nthe document was removed from UN website on Friday, 17 March 2017. The\nreport's Executive Summary was also deleted from the United Nations\nInformation System on the Question of Palestine (UNISPAL).\n\nOn 17 March, Khalaf submitted her letter of resignation to Guterres. Following\nthe strong response from Israel, she wrote: \"It is only normal for criminals\nto pressure and attack those who advocate the cause of their victims.\" She\ncontinued to stand by the report."
