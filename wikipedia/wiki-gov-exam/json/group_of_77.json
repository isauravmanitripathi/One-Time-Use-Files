        "generated_section_content_md": "Coalition of developing countries\n\nThe **Group of 77** (**G77**) at the United Nations (UN) is a coalition of\ndeveloping countries, designed to promote its members' collective economic\ninterests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United\nNations. The group consists of a diverse set of states with a common South-\nSouth ideology. There were 77 founding members of the organization\nheadquartered in Geneva, but it has since expanded to 134 member countries.\nIraq holds its chairmanship for 2025, succeeding Uganda.\n\nThe group was founded on 15 June 1964, by 77 non-aligned nations in the \"Joint\nDeclaration of the Seventy-Seven Countries\" issued at the United Nations\nConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The first major meeting was in\nAlgiers in 1967, where the _Charter of Algiers_ was adopted and the basis for\npermanent institutional structures was begun under the leadership of Ra\u00fal\nPrebisch who had previously worked at ECLA. There are _Chapters of the Group\nof 77_ in Geneva (UN), Rome (FAO), Vienna (UNIDO), Paris (UNESCO), Nairobi\n(UNEP) and the Group of 24 in Washington, D.C. (International Monetary Fund\nand World Bank)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The group was credited with a common stance against apartheid and for\nsupporting global disarmament. It has been supportive of the New International\nEconomic Order.\n\nRegarding environmental matters, the G77's position is that the developed\ncountries bear historical responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions,\npointing also to the disparity in per capita emissions between the developing\nand developed countries. As a result, the G77 often resists binding\ncommitments to reduce its emissions. The G77 has been subject to criticism for\nits lacklustre support, or outright opposition, to pro-environmental\ninitiatives, which the group considers secondary to economic development and\npoverty eradication initiatives. In turn, the G77 has criticized the wealthier\nnations for their insufficient attention to poverty eradication, including at\nthe 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de\nJaneiro, Brazil."

South Korea was a founding member but left the Group after joining the OECD in 1996.\n4. Yugoslavia was a founding member; by the late 1990s, it was still listed on the membership list, but it was noted that it \"cannot participate in the activities of G77.\" It was removed from the list in late 2003.[_citation needed_] It had presided over the group from 1985 to 1986.\n* Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only former Yugoslavian state to be listed as a member on the G77 official website in 2007; it was removed from the member list in February 2020.\n5. Cyprus was a founding member but was no longer listed on the official membership list after it acceded to the European Union in 2004.[_citation needed_] A document from 1975 states that Cyprus is not a member.\n6. South Vietnam was a founding member, while North Vietnam never joined separately.\n7. South Yemen joined separately from founding member North Yemen sometime between 1967 and 1975.\n8. Malta was admitted to the Group in 1976 but was no longer listed on the official membership list after it acceded to the European Union in 2004.\n9. Palau joined the Group in 2002 but withdrew in 2004, having decided that it could best pursue its environmental interests through the Alliance of Small Island States.\n10. Romania was classed as a Latin American country for the purposes of the G77, having joined in 1976. The G77 was divided into geographical regions, and because there was technically no European area, Romania was placed under the umbrella of Latin America. Romania left the G77 following its accession to the European Union."
