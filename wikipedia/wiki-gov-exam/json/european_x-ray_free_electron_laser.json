The first laser pulses\nwere produced in May 2017 and the facility started user operation in September\n2017. The international project with twelve participating countries; nine\nshareholders at the time of commissioning (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary,\nPoland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden and Switzerland), later joined by three other\npartners (Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), is located in the German\nfederal states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein. A free-electron laser\ngenerates high-intensity electromagnetic radiation by accelerating electrons\nto relativistic speeds and directing them through special magnetic structures.\nThe European XFEL is constructed such that the electrons produce X-ray light\nin synchronisation, resulting in high-intensity X-ray pulses with the\nproperties of laser light and at intensities much brighter than those produced\nby conventional synchrotron light sources."

The use of\nsuperconducting acceleration elements developed at DESY allows up to 27,000\nrepetitions per second, significantly more than other X-ray lasers in the U.S.\nand Japan can achieve. The electrons are then introduced into the magnetic\nfields of special arrays of magnets called undulators, where they follow\nslalom like trajectories resulting in the emission of X-rays whose wavelength\nis in the range of 0.05 to 4.7 nm."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The X-rays are generated by self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE), where\nelectrons interact with the radiation that they or their neighbours emit.\nSince it is not possible to build mirrors to reflect the X-rays for multiple\npasses through the electron beam gain medium, as with light lasers, the X-rays\nare generated in a single pass through the beam. The result is spontaneous\nemission of X-ray photons which are coherent (in phase) like laser light,\nunlike X-rays emitted by ordinary sources like X-ray machines, which are\nincoherent. The peak brilliance of the European XFEL is billions of times\nhigher than that of conventional X-ray light sources, while the average\nbrilliance is 10,000 times higher. The higher electron energy allows the\nproduction of shorter wavelengths. The duration of the light pulses can be\nless than 100 femtoseconds."
