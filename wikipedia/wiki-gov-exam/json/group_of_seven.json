        "generated_section_content_md": "Intergovernmental political and economic forum\n\nThe **Group of Seven** (**G7**) is an intergovernmental political and economic\nforum consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom\nand the United States; additionally, the European Union (EU) is a \"non-\nenumerated member\". It is organized around shared values of pluralism, liberal\ndemocracy, and representative government. G7 members are major IMF advanced\neconomies.\n\nOriginating from an _ad hoc_ gathering of finance ministers in 1973, the G7\nhas since become a formal, high-profile venue for discussing and coordinating\nsolutions to major global issues, especially in the areas of trade, security,\neconomics, and climate change. Each member's head of government or state,\nalong with the EU's Commission president and European Council president, meet\nannually at the G7 Summit; other high-ranking officials of the G7 and the EU\nmeet throughout the year. Representatives of other states and international\norganizations are often invited as guests, with Russia having been a formal\nmember (as part of the G8) from 1997 until its expulsion in 2014.\n\nThe G7 is not based on a treaty and has no permanent secretariat or office. It\nis organized through a presidency that rotates annually among the member\nstates, with the presiding state setting the group's priorities and hosting\nthe summit; Canada presides for 2025. While lacking a legal or institutional\nbasis, the G7 is widely considered to wield significant international\ninfluence; it has catalyzed or spearheaded several major global initiatives,\nincluding efforts to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, provide financial aid to\ndeveloping countries, and address climate change through the 2015 Paris\nAgreement. However, the group has been criticized by observers for its\nallegedly outdated and limited membership, narrow global representation, and\nineffectualness. The rise of BRICS+ for example, with its expanded membership\nand focus on South-South cooperation, reflects a broader shift in global power\ndynamics, with emerging economies gaining greater influence in international\naffairs.\n\nThe G7 countries have together a population of about 780 million people (or\nalmost 10% of the world population), comprise around 50% of worldwide nominal\nnet wealth and as of 2024 more than 44% of world nominal GDP and about 30% of\nworld GDP by purchasing power parity."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The concept of a forum for the capitalist world's major industrialized\ncountries emerged before the 1973 oil crisis. On 25 March 1973, the United\nStates secretary of the treasury, George Shultz, convened an informal\ngathering of finance ministers from West Germany (Helmut Schmidt), France\n(Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing), and the United Kingdom (Anthony Barber) before an\nupcoming meeting in Washington, DC. United States president Richard Nixon\noffered the White House as a venue, and the meeting was subsequently held in\nits library on the ground floor; the original group of four consequently\nbecame known as the \"Library Group\". In mid-1973, at the Spring Meetings of\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Shultz proposed the\naddition of Japan, which all members accepted. The informal gathering of\nsenior financial officials from the United States, United Kingdom, West\nGermany, Japan, and France became known as the \"Group of Five\".\n\nIn 1974, all five members endured sudden and often troubled changes in\nleadership. French president Georges Pompidou abruptly died, leading to a\nfresh presidential election that was closely won by Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing.\nWest German chancellor Willy Brandt, American president Richard Nixon, and\nJapanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka all resigned due to scandals. In the\nUnited Kingdom, a hung election led to a minority government whose subsequent\ninstability prompted another election the same year. Consequently, Nixon's\nsuccessor, Gerald Ford, proposed a retreat the following year for the group's\nnew leaders to learn about one another."

Taking place at the\nCh\u00e2teau de Rambouillet, the meeting focused on several major economic issues,\nincluding the oil crisis, the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, and the\nongoing global recession. The result was the 15-point \"Declaration of\nRambouillet\", which, among other positions, announced the group's united\ncommitment to promoting free trade, multilateralism, cooperation with the\ndeveloping world, and rapprochement with the Eastern Bloc. The members also\nestablished plans for future gatherings to take place regularly every year.\n\nIn 1976, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who had participated in the\nfirst G6 summit, resigned from office; Schmidt and Ford believed the group\nneeded an English speaker with more political experience, and advocated for\ninviting Pierre Trudeau, who had been Prime Minister of Canada for eight years\n\u2013 significantly longer than any G6 leader. Canada was also the next largest\nadvanced economy after the G6 members. The summit in Dorado, Puerto Rico later\nthat year became the first of the current Group of Seven (G7).\n\nIn 1977, the United Kingdom, which hosted that year's summit, invited the\nEuropean Economic Community to join all G7 summits; beginning in 1981, it has\nattended every gathering through the president of the European Commission and\nthe leader of the country holding the presidency of the Council of the\nEuropean Union. Since 2009, the then-newly established position of the\nPresident of the European Council, who serves as the Union's principal foreign\nrepresentative, also regularly attends the summits."

The Accord, which involved only the\noriginal Group of Five, was announced the day before it was finalized, with a\ncommuniqu\u00e9 issued afterward. The 1980s also marked the G7's expanded concerns\nbeyond macroeconomic issues, namely with respect to international security and\nconflict; for example, it sought to address the ongoing conflicts between Iran\nand Iraq and between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.\n\nFollowing the 1994 summit in Naples, Russian officials held separate meetings\nwith leaders of the G7. This informal arrangement was dubbed the \"Political 8\"\n(P8), colloquially the G7+1. At the invitation of the G7 leaders, Russian\nPresident Boris Yeltsin was invited first as a guest observer, and later as a\nfull participant. After the 1997 meeting, Russia was formally invited to the\nnext meeting and formally joined the group in 1998, resulting in the Group of\nEight (G8). Russia was an outlier in the group, as it lacked the national\nwealth and financial weight of other members, and at the time was not an\nestablished liberal democracy. Its invitation, made during a difficult\ntransition to a post-communist economy, is believed to have been motivated by\na desire to encourage its political and economic reforms and international\nengagement.\n\nRussia's membership was suspended in March 2014 in response to its annexation\nof Crimea. Members stopped short of permanently ejecting the country, and in\nsubsequent years expressed an openness or express desire to reinstate Russian\nparticipation. In January 2017, Russia announced it would permanently leave\nthe G8, which came into effect June 2018. In 2020, U.S. President Donald\nTrump, backed by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, advocated for Russia's\nreturn; all other members rejected the proposal, and Russia expressed no\ninterest."

The U.S.-based Atlantic\nCouncil has held the D-10 Strategy Forum since 2014 with representatives from\nwhat it calls \"leading democracies\" which support a \"rules-based democratic\norder\", consisting of all members of the G7 (including the European Union)\nplus Australia and South Korea. Several democratic countries \u2013 including\nIndia, Indonesia, Poland, and Spain \u2013 participate as observers. Centered\naround a similar mandate as the G7, the D-10 has been considered by some\nanalysts to be an alternative to the group; This is also favored by various\nthink tanks and former British leader Boris Johnson.\n\nIn 2019 under Putin, Russia had signaled support for the inclusion of China,\nIndia, and Turkey if the G7 had reinstated Russian membership.\n\nIn 2020 under Trump, the U.S. had signaled support for the inclusion of\nAustralia, Brazil, India, and South Korea, plus the reincorporation of Russia.\nThe leaders of the other six G7 members unanimously rejected this proposal.\n\nAlso in November 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine, writing in _Foreign\nAffairs_ , suggested that the G7 might be expanded to a \"T-12\" of \"Techno\nDemocracies\". Earlier, in June of that same year, the Global Partnership on\nArtificial Intelligence (GPAI) was announced. Something of a spin-out of the\nG7, founded by members Canada and France, GPAI's initial membership was 15,\nincluding both the EU and India, as well as Australia, Mexico, New Zealand,\nSingapore, Slovenia, and the Republic of Korea.\n\nBoris Johnson invited representatives of Australia and the Republic of Korea\nto the June 2021 G7 summit. India was also invited to the 2021 summit, with an\naim to \"deepen the expertise and experience around the table\" along with the\nother guests, according to a U.K. government statement.\n\nIn 2021, French jurist and consultant Eric Gardner de B\u00e9ville, a member of the\n_Cercle Montesquieu_ , proposed Spain's membership to the G7. American Charg\u00e9\nd'Affaires in Spain, Conrad Tribble, stated that the United States\n\"enthusiastically supports\" a \"greater\" role of Spanish leadership at the\ninternational level.\n\nIn April 2022, Germany confirmed it would be inviting India, against rumours\nto the contrary.[_needs update_]\n\nIn March 2023, Japan's prime minister Fumio Kishida invited South Korea,\nAustralia, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Vietnam, the Comoros (African Union\npresident from February 2023 to February 2024), the Cook Islands (Pacific\nIslands Forum president from February 2021 to May 2024) and Ukraine to the\n49th summit hosted in Hiroshima.\n\nRonald A. Klain writing for the Carnegie Endowment, proposed creating the G9\nby adding South Korea and Australia due to the Eurocentrism of the current\nalliance and rising challenges posed by China in Asia.\n\nIn March 2025, Prime Minister of Canada Mark Carney invited President of\nUkraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy to attend the 51st G7 summit in Kananaskis,\nAlberta, followed by invitations for Prime Minister of Australia Anthony\nAlbanese to attend in May and Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi to attend\nin June."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The G7 was founded primarily to facilitate shared macroeconomic initiatives in\nresponse to contemporary economic problems; the first gathering was centered\naround the Nixon shock, the 1970s energy crisis, and the ensuing global\nrecession. Since 1975, the group has met annually at summits organized and\nhosted by whichever country occupies the annually-rotating presidency; since\n1987, the G7 Finance Ministers have met at least semi-annually, and up to four\ntimes a year at stand-alone meetings.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, the G7 broadened its areas of concern to include\nissues of international security, human rights, and global security; for\nexample, during this period, the G7 concerned itself with the ongoing Iran-\nIraq War and Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. In the 1990s, it launched a\ndebt-relief program for the 42 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC);\nprovided $300 million to help build the Shelter Structure over the damaged\nreactor at Chernobyl; and established the Financial Stability Forum to help in\n\"managing the international monetary system\".\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, the G7 began emphasizing engagement with the\ndeveloping world. At the 1999 summit, the group helped launch the G20, a\nsimilar forum made up of the G7 and the next 13 largest economies (including\nthe European Union), in order to \"promote dialogue between major industrial\nand emerging market countries\"; the G20 has been touted by some of its members\nas a replacement for the G7. Having previously announced a plan to cancel 90%\nof bilateral debt for the HIPC, totaling $100 billion, in 2005 the G7\nannounced debt reductions of \"up to 100%\" to be negotiated on a \"case by case\"\nbasis.\n\nAfter the 2008 financial crisis, the G7 met twice in Washington, D.C. in 2008\nand in Rome in February 2009. G7 finance ministers pledged to take \"all\nnecessary steps\" to stem the crisis, devising an \"aggressive action plan\" that\nincluded providing publicly funded capital infusions to banks in danger of\nfailing. Some analysts criticized the group for seemingly advocating that\nindividual governments develop individual responses to the recession, rather\nthan cohere around a united effort.\n\nIn subsequent years, the G7 has faced several geopolitical challenges that\nhave led some international analysts to question its credibility, or propose\nits replacement by the G20. On 2 March 2014, the G7 condemned the Russian\nFederation for its \"violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of\nUkraine\" through its military intervention. The group also announced its\ncommitment to \"mobilize rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in\naddressing its macroeconomic, regulatory and anti-corruption challenges\",\nwhile adding that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was best suited to\nstabilizing the country's finances and economy.\n\nIn response to Russia's subsequent annexation of Crimea, on 24 March the G7\nconvened an emergency meeting at the official residence of the Prime Minister\nof the Netherlands, the Catshuis in The Hague; this location was chosen\nbecause all G7 leaders were already present to attend the 2014 Nuclear\nSecurity Summit hosted by the Netherlands. This was the first G7 meeting\nneither taking place in a member state nor having the host leader\nparticipating in the meeting. The upcoming G8 summit in Sochi, Russia was\nmoved to Brussels, where the EU was the host. On 5 June 2014 the G7 condemned\nMoscow for its \"continuing violation\" of Ukraine's sovereignty and stated they\nwere prepared to impose further sanctions on Russia. This meeting was the\nfirst since Russia was suspended from the G8, and subsequently it has not been\ninvolved in any G7 summit.\n\nThe G7 has continued to take a strong stance against Russia's \"destabilising\nbehaviour and malign activities\" in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world,\nfollowing the joint communique from the June 2021 summit in the U.K. The group\nalso called on Russia to address international cybercrime attacks launched\nfrom within its borders, and to investigate the use of chemical weapons on\nRussian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. The June 2021 summit also saw the G7\ncommit to helping the world recover from the global COVID-19 pandemic\n(including plans to help vaccinate the entire world); encourage further action\nagainst climate change and biodiversity loss; and promote \"shared values\" of\npluralism and democracy.\n\nIn 2022, G7 leaders were invited to attend an extraordinary summit of NATO\ncalled in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn April 2024, the G7 countries agreed to close all coal power plants in\n2030-2035 unless their greenhouse gases will be captured or the countries will\nfind another way to align their emissions with the 1.5 degree pathway."
