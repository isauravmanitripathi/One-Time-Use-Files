The 1996 Ottawa Declaration established the Arctic Council as a forum\nfor promoting cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the Arctic\nstates, with the involvement of the Arctic Indigenous communities and other\nArctic inhabitants on issues such as sustainable development and environmental\nprotection. The Arctic Council has conducted studies on climate change, oil\nand gas, and Arctic shipping.\n\nIn 2011, the Council member states concluded the Arctic Search and Rescue\nAgreement, the first binding treaty concluded under the council's auspices.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the\nUnited States declared that they will not attend meetings of the Arctic\nCouncil under Russian chairmanship because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nThe same countries issued a second statement on June 8, 2022 that declared\ntheir intent to resume cooperation on a limited number of previously approved\nArctic Council projects that do not involve Russian leadership or\nparticipation."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Seven of the eight-member states, excluding Iceland, have indigenous\ncommunities living in their Arctic areas. Organizations of Arctic Indigenous\nPeoples can obtain the status of Permanent Participant to the Arctic Council,\nbut only if they represent either one indigenous group residing in more than\none Arctic State, or two or more Arctic indigenous peoples groups in a single\nArctic state. The number of Permanent Participants should at any time be less\nthan the number of members. The category of Permanent Participants has been\ncreated to provide for active participation and full consultation with the\nArctic indigenous representatives within the Arctic Council. This principle\napplies to all meetings and activities of the Arctic Council.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nPermanent Participants may address the meetings. They may raise points of\norder that require an immediate decision by the chairman. Agendas of\nMinisterial Meetings need to be consulted beforehand with them; they may\npropose supplementary agenda items. When calling the biannual meetings of\nSenior Arctic Officials, the Permanent Participants must have been consulted\nbeforehand. Moreover, though only states have a right to vote in the Arctic\nCouncil the permanent participants must, according to the Ottawa Declaration\nbe fully consulted, which is close to _de facto_ power of veto should they all\nreject a particular proposal. This mandatory consultation process matches the\nconsultation and free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) requirement mentioned\nin the United Nation Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Finally,\nPermanent Participants may propose cooperative activities, such as projects.\nAll this makes the position of Arctic indigenous peoples within the Arctic\nCouncil quite influential compared to the (often marginal) role of such\npeoples in other international governmental fora. The status of permanent\nparticipant is indeed unique and enables circumpolar peoples to be seated at\nthe same table as states' delegations while in any other international\norganization it is not the case. Nevertheless, decision-making in the Arctic\nCouncil remains in the hands of the eight-member states, on the basis of\nconsensus.[_citation needed_]\n\nAs of 2023, six Arctic indigenous communities have Permanent Participant\nstatus. These groups are represented by\n\n* The Aleut International Association (AIA), representing more than 15,000 Aleuts in Russia and the United States (Alaska).\n* The Arctic Athabaskan Council (AAC), representing 45,000 Athabaskan peoples in Canada (Northwest Territories and Yukon) and the United States (Alaska).\n* The Gwich'in Council International (GCI), representing 9,000 Gwich\u02bcin people in Canada (Northwest Territories and Yukon) and the United States (Alaska).\n* The Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), representing 180,000 Inuit in Canada (Inuit Nunangat), Greenland, Russia (Chukotka) and the United States (Alaska).\n* The Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), representing 250,000 Indigenous peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East.\n* The Saami Council, representing more than 100,000 S\u00e1mi of Finland, Norway, Russia and Sweden.\n\nHowever prominent the role of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Participant\nstatus does not confer any legal recognition as peoples. The Ottawa\nDeclaration, the Arctic Council's founding document, explicitly states (in a\nfootnote):\n\n> \"The use of the term 'peoples' in this declaration shall not be construed as\n> having any implications as regard the rights which may attach to the term\n> under international law.\"\n\nThe Indigenous Permanent Participants are assisted by the Arctic Council\nIndigenous Peoples Secretariat."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Before signing the Ottawa Declaration, a footnote was added stating; \"The\nArctic Council should not deal with matters related to military security\". In\n2019, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stated that circumstances\nhad changed and \"the region has become an arena for power and for competition.\nAnd the eight Arctic states must adapt to this new future\". The council is\noften in the middle of security and geopolitical issues since the Arctic has\npeculiar interests to Member States and Observers. Changes in the Arctic\nenvironment and participants of the Arctic Council have led to a\nreconsideration of the relationship between geopolitical matters and the role\nof the Arctic Council.[_citation needed_]\n\nDisputes over land and ocean in the Arctic had been extremely limited. The\nonly outstanding land dispute was between Canada and Denmark, the Whisky War,\nover Hans Island, which was resolved in the summer of 2022 with agreement to\nsplit the island in half. There are oceanic claims between the United States\nand Canada in the Beaufort Sea.\n\nClaims to the Arctic Seabed and Arctic Sea.\n\nThe major territorial disputes are over exclusive rights to the seabed under\nthe central Arctic high seas. Due to climate change and melting of the Arctic\nsea-ice, more energy resources and waterways are now becoming accessible.\nLarge reserves of oil, gas and minerals are located within the Arctic. This\nenvironmental factor generated territorial disputes among member states. The\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea allows states to extend their\nexclusive right to exploit resources on and in the continental shelf if they\ncan prove that seabed more than 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) from\nbaselines is a natural prolongation of the land. Canada, Russia, and Denmark\n(via Greenland) have all submitted partially overlapping claims to the UN\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), which is charged\nwith confirming the continental shelf's outer limits. Once the CLCS makes its\nrulings, Russia, Denmark, and Canada will need to negotiate to divide their\noverlapping claims.\n\nDisputes also exist over the nature of the Northwest Passage and the Northeast\nPassage / Northern Sea Route. Canada claims the entire Northwest Passage are\nCanadian Internal Waters, which means Canada would have total control over\nwhich ships may enter the channel. The United States believes the Passage is\nan international strait, which would mean any ship could transit at any time,\nand Canada could not close the Passage. Russia's claims over the Northern Sea\nRoute are significantly different. Russia only claims small segments of the\nNorthern Sea Route around straits as internal waters. However, Russia requires\nall commercial vessels to request and obtain permission to navigate in a large\narea of the Russian Arctic exclusive economic zone under Article 234 of the UN\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, which grants coastal states greater powers\nover ice-covered waters.\n\nCanadian sovereignty over the Northwest Passage arouses substantial public\nconcern in Canada. A poll indicated that half of Canadian respondents said\nCanada should try to assert its full sovereignty rights over the Beaufort Sea\ncompared to just 10 percent of Americans. New commercial trans-Arctic shipping\nroutes can be another factor of conflicts. A poll found that Canadians\nperceive the Northwest Passage as their internal Canadian waterway whereas\nother countries assert it is an international waterway.\n\nThe increase in the number of observer states drew attention to other national\nsecurity issues. Observers have demonstrated their interests in the Arctic\nregion. China has explicitly shown its desire to extract natural resources in\nGreenland.\n\nMilitary infrastructure is another point to consider. Canada, Denmark, Norway\nand Russia are rapidly increasing their defence presence by building up their\nmilitaries in the Arctic and developing their building infrastructure.\n\nHowever, some say that the Arctic Council facilitates stability despite\npossible conflicts among member states. Norwegian Admiral Haakon Bruun-Hanssen\nhas suggested that the Arctic is \"probably the most stable area in the world\".\nThey say that laws are well established and followed. Member states think that\nthe sharing cost of the development of Arctic shipping-lanes, research, etc.,\nby cooperation and good relationships between states is beneficial to all.\n\nLooking at these two different perspectives, some suggest that the Arctic\nCouncil should expand its role by including peace and security issues as its\nagenda. A 2010 survey showed that large majorities of respondents in Norway,\nCanada, Finland, Iceland, and Denmark were very supportive on the issues of an\nArctic nuclear-weapons free zone. Although only a small majority of Russian\nrespondents supported such measures, more than 80 percent of them agreed that\nthe Arctic Council should cover peace-building issues. Paul Berkman suggests\nthat solving security matters in the Arctic Council could save members the\nmuch larger amount of time required to reach a decision in United Nations.\nHowever, as of June 2014, military security matters are often avoided. The\nfocus on science and resource protection and management is seen as a priority,\nwhich could be diluted or strained by the discussion of geopolitical security\nissues."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Media narratives have played a significant role in shaping perceptions of the\nArctic Council and its activities. The China threat narrative, for example,\nportrays China as leveraging its observer status to pursue economic and\nstrategic advantages in the Arctic. These portrayals have contributed to\nbroader geopolitical concerns, despite evidence that China has largely adhered\nto the Council\u2019s cooperative norms.\n\nSimilarly, the concept of a resource rush in the Arctic has been amplified by\nmedia portrayals, framing the region as a potential hotspot for conflict over\nresources and maritime routes. While such narratives have heightened attention\nto the Arctic\u2019s strategic importance, they often oversimplify the Council\u2019s\nefforts to maintain neutrality and collaborative governance. These dynamics\nillustrate the increasing complexity of balancing the Arctic Council\u2019s\noriginal mission with growing global interest in the region."
