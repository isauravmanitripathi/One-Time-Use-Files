        "generated_section_content_md": "The UNDP was founded on 22 November 1965 through the merger of the Expanded\nProgramme of Technical Assistance (EPTA) and the Special Fund in 1958. The\nrationale was to \"avoid duplication of [their] activities\". The EPTA was set\nup in 1949 to support the economic and political aspects of underdeveloped\ncountries while the Special Fund was to enlarge the scope of UN technical\nassistance. The Special Fund arose from the idea of a Special United Nations\nFund for Economic Development (SUNFED) (which was initially known as the\nUnited Nations Fund for Economic Development (UNFED).\n\nCountries such as the Nordic countries were proponents of such a United\nNations (UN) controlled fund. However, the fund was opposed by other developed\ncountries, especially by the United States, which were wary of the Third World\ndominating such funding and preferred it to be under the auspices of the World\nBank. The concept of SUNFED was dropped to form the Special Fund. This Special\nFund was a compromise over the SUNFED concept: it did not provide investment\ncapital but only helped to bring pre-conditions for private investment.\n\nWith the US proposing and creating the International Development Association\nwithin the World Bank's umbrella, the EPTA and the Special Fund appeared to be\nconducting similar work. In 1962, the United Nations Economic and Social\nCouncil asked the Secretary-General to consider the merits and disadvantages\nof merging UN technical assistance programmes and in 1966, the EPTA and the\nSpecial Fund merged to form the UNDP."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 2019, reports alleging possible misappropriation of funds for UNDP projects\nin Russia began to appear in the mainstream media. An article called \"Greed\nand Graft at U.N. Climate Program\" in August 2019 in _Foreign Policy_ reported\nthe findings of a 2017 final evaluation that a UNDP Global Environment\nFacility greenhouse gas reduction project, the UNDP GEF Energy Efficiency\nStandards and Labels project in Russia with a budget of US$7.8 million, did\nnot meet its goals and had \"strong indicators of deliberate misappropriation\"\nof funds. The _Foreign Policy_ article reported that concerns raised by\nwhistleblowers Dmitry Ershov and John O'Brien and multiple other consultants\nto the project over many years about irregularities in the programme \u2014 which\nwere first reported internally as far back in 2011\u2014 were largely dismissed or\nignored for several years by their superiors in Istanbul, New York, and\nWashington, as well as by donor governments, including the United States. The\n_Foreign Policy_ article reported that a 2017 confidential audit appendix\nprepared by final evaluators found \"strong indicators of deliberate\nmisappropriation\" of millions of dollars in funds from the project between\n2010 and 2014.\n\nThis led in March 2020 to 12 donor governments writing a letter to UNDP\nAdministrator Achim Steiner demanding from UNDP an independent review of\nUNDP's handling of the energy efficiency standards and labels project in\nRussia, as reported again in _Foreign Policy_ magazine in December 2020 where\nit was revealed that these donors had blasted UNDP for resisting appeals to\nfight corruption and further reports by the Financial Times about the\n'systemic nature' of the problems and also reports by various other media\noutlets such as Climate Change News, Passblue and in Newsroom in the New\nZealand media. In January 2021, this independent report into the matter as\nrequested by the donors was published, 'Systems and Silos'. This independent\nreview found \"irregularities\" and concluded the project in question was not\nmanaged \"either efficiently or effectively\" by UNDP and that a number of\nindividuals were able to 'game the relatively weak systems of governance and\ntechnical capacity.' It suggested UNDP consider returning to the Global\nEnvironment Facility (which funded the project) its \"entire management fee\" as\n\"restitution\" and proposed \"ongoing efforts to achieve changes in the work\nculture that reward greater transparency and remove fears of unfair reprisals\"\naimed at whistleblowers. Concerns over UNDP's failure to handle the Russia\ncontroversy in a satisfactory manner led to the government of the Netherlands\nwithholding some 10 million euros in funding in early 2021.\n\nIn February 2022, the leaders of three leading NGOs in the fight against\ncorruption, Transparency International, the Whistleblower International\nNetwork or WIN, and the Government Accountability Project wrote a public\nletter to UNDP's administrator Achim Steiner, expressing their serious\nconcerns about the lack of whistleblower protection for John O'Brien and\nDmitry Ershov by UNDP and highlighting the conclusion of the independent\nreview on the failure by UNDP to carry out John O'Brien's whistleblower case\nin a satisfactory manner. According to the 2019 Foreign Policy article, Ershov\nclaimed he was \"pushed out of his U.N. job\" after raising concerns about\nprocurement irregularities and project conflicts of interest way back at the\nend of 2014.\n\nIn June 2022, BBC Two broadcast a 90-minute documentary,_The Whistleblowers:\nInside the UN_ , which reported on whistleblower cases across the UN system,\nincluding John O'Brien's case. It reported that O'Brien was fired from UNDP in\nMarch 2022 several days after his BBC interview. The documentary was described\nby _The Guardian_ as exposing \"a toxic culture\" where senior UN leaders hide\n\"behind a cloak of saintliness.\""
