        "generated_section_content_md": "International financial institution\n\nThe **International Monetary Fund** (**IMF**) is an international financial\ninstitution and a specialized agency of the United Nations, headquartered in\nWashington, D.C. It consists of 190 member countries, and its stated mission\nis \"working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability,\nfacilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable\neconomic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.\" The IMF acts as a\nlender of last resort to its members experiencing actual or potential balance\nof payments crises.\n\nEstablished in July 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference based on the ideas of\nHarry Dexter White and John Maynard Keynes, the IMF came into formal existence\nin 1945 with 29 member countries and the goal of reconstructing the\ninternational monetary system. For its first three decades, the IMF oversaw\nthe Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rate arrangements. Following the\ncollapse of this system in 1971, the Fund's role shifted to managing balance-\nof-payments difficulties and international financial crises, becoming a key\ninstitution in the era of globalization.\n\nThrough a quota system, countries contribute funds to a pool from which they\ncan borrow if they experience balance-of-payments problems; a country's quota\nalso determines its voting power. As a condition for loans, the IMF often\nrequires borrowing countries to undertake policy reforms, known as structural\nadjustment. The organization also provides technical assistance and economic\nsurveillance of its members' economies.\n\nThe IMF's loan conditions have been widely criticized for imposing austerity\nmeasures that can hinder economic recovery and harm the most vulnerable\npopulations. Critics argue that the Fund's policies limit the economic\nsovereignty of borrowing nations and that its governance structure is\ndominated by Western countries, which hold a disproportionate share of voting\npower. The current managing director and chairperson is Bulgarian economist\nKristalina Georgieva, who has held the position since 1 October 2019."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Board of Governors International Monetary Fund (1999)\n\nAccording to the IMF itself, it works to foster global growth and economic\nstability by providing policy advice and financing to its members. It also\nworks with developing countries to help them achieve macroeconomic stability\nand reduce poverty. The rationale for this is that private international\ncapital markets function imperfectly and many countries have limited access to\nfinancial markets. Such market imperfections, together with balance-of-\npayments financing, provide the justification for official financing, without\nwhich many countries could only correct large external payment imbalances\nthrough measures with adverse economic consequences. The IMF provides\nalternate sources of financing such as the Poverty Reduction and Growth\nFacility.\n\nUpon the founding of the IMF, its three primary functions were:\n\n* to oversee the fixed exchange rate arrangements between countries, thus helping national governments manage their exchange rates and allowing these governments to prioritize economic growth, and\n* to provide short-term capital to aid the balance of payments and prevent the spread of international financial crisis.\n* to help mend the pieces of the international economy after the Great Depression and World War II as well as to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as infrastructure.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe IMF's role was fundamentally altered by the floating exchange rates after\n1971. It shifted to examining the economic policies of countries with IMF loan\nagreements to determine whether a shortage of capital was due to economic\nfluctuations or economic policy. The IMF also researched what types of\ngovernment policy would ensure economic recovery. A particular concern of the\nIMF was to prevent financial crises, such as those in Mexico in 1982, Brazil\nin 1987, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and the 1998 Russian financial\ncrisis, from spreading and threatening the entire global financial and\ncurrency system. The challenge was to promote and implement a policy that\nreduced the frequency of crises among emerging market countries, especially\nthe middle-income countries which are vulnerable to massive capital outflows.\nRather than maintaining a position of oversight of only exchange rates, their\nfunction became one of surveillance of the overall macroeconomic performance\nof member countries. Their role became a lot more active because the IMF now\nmanages economic policy rather than just exchange rates.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn addition, the IMF negotiates conditions on lending and loans under their\npolicy of conditionality, which was established in the 1950s. Low-income\ncountries can borrow on concessional terms, which means there is a period of\ntime with no interest rates, through the Extended Credit Facility (ECF), the\nStandby Credit Facility (SCF) and the Rapid Credit Facility (RCF). Non-\nconcessional loans, which include interest rates, are provided mainly through\nthe Stand-By Arrangements (SBA), the Flexible Credit Line (FCL), the\nPrecautionary and Liquidity Line (PLL), and the Extended Fund Facility. The\nIMF provides emergency assistance via the Rapid Financing Instrument (RFI) to\nmembers facing urgent balance-of-payments needs."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The IMF is mandated to oversee the international monetary and financial system\nand monitor the economic and financial policies of its member countries.\nAccurate estimations require a degree of participatory surveillance. Market\nsizes and economic facts are estimated using member-state data, shared and\nverifiable by the organization's other member-states. This transparency is\nintended to facilitate international co-operation and trade. Since the demise\nof the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the early 1970s,\nsurveillance has evolved largely by way of changes in procedures rather than\nthrough the adoption of new obligations.\n\nThe Fund typically analyses the appropriateness of each member country's\neconomic and financial policies for achieving orderly economic growth, and\nassesses the consequences of these policies for other countries and for the\nglobal economy. For instance, The IMF played a significant role in individual\ncountries, such as Armenia and Belarus, in providing financial support to\nachieve stabilization financing from 2009 to 2019. The maximum sustainable\ndebt level of a polity, which is watched closely by the IMF, was defined in\n2011 by IMF economists to be 120%. Indeed, it was at this number that the\nGreek government-debt crisis started in 2010.\n\nIMF Data Dissemination Systems participants:\n\nIMF member using SDDS\n\nIMF member using GDDS\n\nIMF member, not using any of the DDSystems\n\nnon-IMF entity using SDDS\n\nnon-IMF entity using GDDS\n\nno interaction with the IMF\n\nIn 1995, the International Monetary Fund began to work on data dissemination\nstandards with the view of guiding IMF member countries to disseminate their\neconomic and financial data to the public. The International Monetary and\nFinancial Committee (IMFC) endorsed the guidelines for the dissemination\nstandards and they were split into two tiers: The General Data Dissemination\nSystem (GDDS) and the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).\n\nThe executive board approved the SDDS and GDDS in 1996 and 1997, respectively,\nand subsequent amendments were published in a revised _Guide to the General\nData Dissemination System_. The system is aimed primarily at statisticians and\naims to improve many aspects of statistical systems in a country. It is also\npart of the World Bank Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and Poverty\nReduction Strategic Papers (PRSPs).[_citation needed_]\n\nThe primary objective of the GDDS is to encourage member countries to build a\nframework to improve data quality and statistical capacity building to\nevaluate statistical needs, set priorities in improving timeliness,\ntransparency, reliability, and accessibility of financial and economic data.\nSome countries initially used the GDDS, but later upgraded to SDDS.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nSome entities that are not IMF members also contribute statistical data to the\nsystems:\n\n* Palestinian Authority \u2013 GDDS\n* Hong Kong \u2013 SDDS\n* Macau \u2013 GDDS\n* Institutions of the European Union:\n* The European Central Bank for the Eurozone \u2013 SDDS\n* Eurostat for the whole EU \u2013 SDDS, thus providing data from Cyprus (not using any DDSystem on its own) and Malta (using only GDDS on its own)[_citation needed_]\n\nA 2021 study found that the IMF's surveillance activities have \"a substantial\nimpact on sovereign debt with much greater impacts in emerging than high-\nincome economies\"."

The incentive problem of moral hazard\u2014when economic agents maximise\ntheir own utility to the detriment of others because they do not bear the full\nconsequences of their actions\u2014is mitigated through conditions rather than\nproviding collateral; countries in need of IMF loans do not generally possess\ninternationally valuable collateral anyway.\n\nConditionality also reassures the IMF that the funds lent to them will be used\nfor the purposes defined by the Articles of Agreement and provides safeguards\nthat the country will be able to rectify its macroeconomic and structural\nimbalances. In the judgment of the IMF, the adoption by the member of certain\ncorrective measures or policies will allow it to repay the IMF, thereby\nensuring that the resources will be available to support other members.\n\nAs of 2004[update], borrowing countries have had a good track record for\nrepaying credit extended under the IMF's regular lending facilities with full\ninterest over the duration of the loan. This indicates that IMF lending does\nnot impose a burden on creditor countries, as lending countries receive\nmarket-rate interest on most of their quota subscription, plus any of their\nown-currency subscriptions that are loaned out by the IMF, plus all of the\nreserve assets that they provide the IMF."

During the Great Depression, countries sharply raised\nbarriers to trade in an attempt to improve their failing economies. This led\nto the devaluation of national currencies and a decline in world trade.\n\nThis breakdown in international monetary cooperation created a need for\noversight. The representatives of 45 governments met at the Bretton Woods\nConference in the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in\nthe United States, to discuss a framework for postwar international economic\ncooperation and how to rebuild Europe.[_citation needed_]\n\nThere were two views on the role the IMF should assume as a global economic\ninstitution. American delegate Harry Dexter White foresaw an IMF that\nfunctioned more like a bank, making sure that borrowing states could repay\ntheir debts on time. Most of White's plan was incorporated into the final acts\nadopted at Bretton Woods. British economist John Maynard Keynes, on the other\nhand, imagined that the IMF would be a cooperative fund upon which member\nstates could draw to maintain economic activity and employment through\nperiodic crises. This view suggested an IMF that helped governments and act as\nthe United States government had during the New Deal to the great depression\nof the 1930s.\n\nThe IMF formally came into existence on 27 December 1945, when the first 29\ncountries ratified its Articles of Agreement. By the end of 1946 the IMF had\ngrown to 39 members. On 1 March 1947, the IMF began its financial operations,\nand on 8 May France became the first country to borrow from it.\n\nThe IMF was one of the key organizations of the international economic system;\nits design allowed the system to balance the rebuilding of international\ncapitalism with the maximization of national economic sovereignty and human\nwelfare, also known as embedded liberalism. The IMF's influence in the global\neconomy steadily increased as it accumulated more members. Its membership\nbegan to expand in the late 1950s and during the 1960s as many African\ncountries became independent and applied for membership. But the Cold War\nlimited the Fund's membership, with most countries in the Soviet sphere of\ninfluence not joining until 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Bretton Woods exchange rate system prevailed until 1971 when the United\nStates government suspended the convertibility of the US$ (and dollar reserves\nheld by other governments) into gold. This is known as the Nixon Shock. The\nchanges to the IMF articles of agreement reflecting these changes were\nratified in 1976 by the Jamaica Accords. Later in the 1970s, large commercial\nbanks began lending to states because they were awash in cash deposited by oil\nexporters. The lending of the so-called money center banks led to the IMF\nchanging its role in the 1980s after a world recession provoked a crisis that\nbrought the IMF back into global financial governance.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, the IMF shifted its narrow focus from currency stabilization\nto a broader focus of promoting market-liberalizing reforms through structural\nadjustment programs. This shift occurred without a formal renegotiation of the\norganization's charter or operational guidelines. The Ronald Reagan\nadministration, in particular Treasury Secretary James Baker, his assistant\nsecretary David Mulford and deputy assistant secretary Charles Dallara,\npressured the IMF to attach market-liberal reforms to the organization's\nconditional loans.\n\nDuring the 20th century, the IMF shifted its position on capital controls.\nWhereas the IMF permitted capital controls at its founding and throughout the\n1970s, IMF staff increasingly favored free capital movement from 1980s\nonwards. This shift happened in the aftermath of an emerging consensus in\neconomics on the desirability of free capital movement, retirement of IMF\nstaff hired in the 1940s and 1950s, and the recruitment of staff exposed to\nnew thinking in economics."

However, by the mid-2000s, IMF lending was at its\nlowest share of world GDP since the 1970s.\n\nIn May 2010, the IMF participated, in 3:11 proportion, in the first Greek\nbailout that totaled \u20ac110 billion, to address the great accumulation of public\ndebt, caused by continuing large public sector deficits. As part of the\nbailout, the Greek government agreed to adopt austerity measures that would\nreduce the deficit from 11% in 2009 to \"well below 3%\" in 2014. The bailout\ndid not include debt restructuring measures such as a haircut, to the chagrin\nof the Swiss, Brazilian, Indian, Russian, and Argentinian Directors of the\nIMF, with the Greek authorities themselves (at the time, PM George Papandreou\nand Finance Minister Giorgos Papakonstantinou) ruling out a haircut.\n\nA second bailout package of more than \u20ac100 billion was agreed upon over the\ncourse of a few months from October 2011, during which time Papandreou was\nforced from office. The so-called Troika, of which the IMF is part, are joint\nmanagers of this programme, which was approved by the executive directors of\nthe IMF on 15 March 2012 for XDR 23.8 billion and saw private bondholders take\na haircut of upwards of 50%.

No insured deposit of \u20ac100k or less were to be\naffected under the terms of a novel bail-in scheme.\n\nThe topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by the IMF in April\n2013, for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"Sovereign Debt\nRestructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and\nPolicy Framework\". The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,\nsummarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and\nJamaica. An explanatory interview with deputy director Hugh Bredenkamp was\npublished a few days later, as was a deconstruction by Matina Stevis of _The\nWall Street Journal_.\n\nIn the October 2013, **Fiscal Monitor** publication, the IMF suggested that a\ncapital levy capable of reducing Euro-area government debt ratios to \"end-2007\nlevels\" would require a very high tax rate of about 10%.\n\nThe **Fiscal Affairs** department of the IMF, headed at the time by Acting\nDirector Sanjeev Gupta, produced a January 2014 report entitled \"Fiscal Policy\nand Income Inequality\" that stated that \"Some taxes levied on wealth,\nespecially on immovable property, are also an option for economies seeking\nmore progressive taxation ... Property taxes are equitable and efficient, but\nunderutilized in many economies ... There is considerable scope to exploit\nthis tax more fully, both as a revenue source and as a redistributive\ninstrument.\""

The managing director is the most powerful\nposition at the IMF. Historically, the IMF's managing director has been a\nEuropean citizen and the president of the World Bank has been an American\ncitizen. However, this standard is increasingly being questioned and\ncompetition for these two posts may soon open up to include other qualified\ncandidates from any part of the world. In August 2019, the International\nMonetary Fund has removed the age limit which is 65 or over for its managing\ndirector position.\n\nIn 2011, the world's largest developing countries, the BRICS states, issued a\nstatement declaring that the tradition of appointing a European as managing\ndirector undermined the legitimacy of the IMF and called for the appointment\nto be merit-based."

The new\nFramework became fully operational in February 2003 and it was applied in the\nsubsequent decisions on Argentina and Brazil. Its purpose was to place some\nsensible rules and limits on the way the IMF makes loans to support\ngovernments with debt problem\u2014especially in emerging markets\u2014and thereby move\naway from the bailout mentality of the 1990s. Such a reform was essential for\nending the crisis atmosphere that then existed in emerging markets. The reform\nwas closely related to and put in place nearly simultaneously with the actions\nof several emerging market countries to place collective action clauses in\ntheir bond contracts.\n\nIn 2010, the framework was abandoned so the IMF could make loans to Greece in\nan unsustainable and political situation.\n\nThe topic of sovereign debt restructuring was taken up by IMF staff in April\n2013 for the first time since 2005, in a report entitled \"Sovereign Debt\nRestructuring: Recent Developments and Implications for the Fund's Legal and\nPolicy Framework\". The paper, which was discussed by the board on 20 May,\nsummarised the recent experiences in Greece, St Kitts and Nevis, Belize, and\nJamaica.

The staff proposed that \"in circumstances where a\n(Sovereign) member has lost market access and debt is considered sustainable\n... the IMF would be able to provide Exceptional Access on the basis of a debt\noperation that involves an extension of maturities\", which was labeled a\n\"reprofiling operation\". These reprofiling operations would \"generally be less\ncostly to the debtor and creditors\u2014and thus to the system overall\u2014relative to\neither an upfront debt reduction operation or a bail-out that is followed by\ndebt reduction ... (and) would be envisaged only when both (a) a member has\nlost market access and (b) debt is assessed to be sustainable, but not with\nhigh probability ... Creditors will only agree if they understand that such an\namendment is necessary to avoid a worse outcome: namely, a default and/or an\noperation involving debt reduction ... Collective action clauses, which now\nexist in most\u2014but not all\u2014bonds would be relied upon to address collective\naction problems.\""

The Group of 24 (G-24), on behalf of LDC members, and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) complained that the IMF did not distinguish sufficiently between disequilibria with predominantly external as opposed to internal causes. This criticism was voiced in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis. Then LDCs found themselves with payment deficits due to adverse changes in their terms of trade, with the Fund prescribing stabilization programmes similar to those suggested for deficits caused by government over-spending. Faced with long-term, externally generated disequilibria, the G-24 argued for more time for LDCs to adjust their economies.\n* Some IMF policies may be anti-developmental; the report said that deflationary effects of IMF programmes quickly led to losses of output and employment in economies where incomes were low and unemployment was high. Moreover, the burden of the deflation is disproportionately borne by the poor.\n* The IMF's initial policies were based in theory and influenced by differing opinions and departmental rivalries. Critics suggest that its intentions to implement these policies in countries with widely varying economic circumstances were misinformed and lacked economic rationale.\n\nODI conclusions were that the IMF's very nature of promoting market-oriented\napproaches attracted unavoidable criticism. On the other hand, the IMF could\nserve as a scapegoat while allowing governments to blame international\nbankers. The ODI conceded that the IMF was insensitive to political\naspirations of LDCs while its policy conditions were inflexible.\n\nArgentina, which had been considered by the IMF to be a model country in its\ncompliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced\na catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to have been caused\nby IMF-induced budget restrictions\u2014which undercut the government's ability to\nsustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health,\neducation, and security\u2014and privatisation of strategically vital national\nresources. Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal\nfederalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly. The crisis\nadded to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South\nAmerican countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic\nproblems. The post-2000s trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the\nregion and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic\npolicy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this\ncrisis.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn 2001, the Independent Evaluation Office, an autonomous body, was\nestablished to conduct independent evaluations of policies and activities of\nthe International Monetary Fund.\n\nIn 2006, a senior ActionAid policy analyst Akanksha Marphatia stated that IMF\npolicies in Africa undermine any possibility of meeting the Millennium\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) due to imposed restrictions that prevent spending on\nimportant sectors, such as education and health.\n\nIn an interview (2008-05-19), the former Romanian Prime Minister C\u0103lin\nPopescu-T\u0103riceanu claimed that \"Since 2005, IMF is constantly making mistakes\nwhen it appreciates the country's economic performances\". Former Tanzanian\nPresident Julius Nyerere, who claimed that debt-ridden African states were\nceding sovereignty to the IMF and the World Bank, famously asked, \"Who elected\nthe IMF to be the ministry of finance for every country in the world?\"\n\nFormer chief economist of IMF and former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor\nRaghuram Rajan who predicted the 2008 financial crisis criticised the IMF for\nremaining a sideline player to the developed world. He criticised the IMF for\npraising the monetary policies of the US, which he believed were wreaking\nhavoc in emerging markets. He had been critical of \"ultra-loose money\npolicies\" of some unnamed countries.\n\nCountries such as Zambia have not received proper aid with long-lasting\neffects, leading to concern from economists. Since 2005, Zambia (as well as 29\nother African countries) did receive debt write-offs, which helped with the\ncountry's medical and education funds. However, Zambia returned to a debt of\nover half its GDP in less than a decade. American economist William Easterly,\nsceptical of the IMF's methods, had initially warned that \"debt relief would\nsimply encourage more reckless borrowing by crooked governments unless it was\naccompanied by reforms to speed up economic growth and improve governance\",\naccording to _The Economist_."

        "section_name": "Conditionality",
        "generated_section_content_md": "The IMF has been criticised for being \"out of touch\" with local economic\nconditions, cultures, and environments in the countries they are requiring\npolicy reform. The economic advice the IMF gives might not always take into\nconsideration the difference between what spending means on paper and how it\nis felt by citizens. Countries charge that with excessive conditionality, they\ndo not \"own\" the programmes and the links are broken between a recipient\ncountry's people, its government, and the goals being pursued by the IMF.\n\nJeffrey Sachs argues that the IMF's \"usual prescription is 'budgetary belt\ntightening to countries who are much too poor to own belts'\". Sachs wrote that\nthe IMF's role as a generalist institution specialising in macroeconomic\nissues needs reform. Conditionality has also been criticised because a country\ncan pledge collateral of \"acceptable assets\" to obtain waivers\u2014if one assumes\nthat all countries are able to provide \"acceptable collateral\".\n\nOne view is that conditionality undermines domestic political institutions.\nThe recipient governments are sacrificing policy autonomy in exchange for\nfunds, which can lead to public resentment of the local leadership for\naccepting and enforcing the IMF conditions. Political instability can result\nfrom more leadership turnover as political leaders are replaced in electoral\nbacklashes. IMF conditions are often criticised for reducing government\nservices, thus increasing unemployment.\n\nAnother criticism is that IMF policies are only designed to address poor\ngovernance, excessive government spending, excessive government intervention\nin markets, and too much state ownership. This assumes that this narrow range\nof issues represents the only possible problems; everything is standardised\nand differing contexts are ignored. A country may also be compelled to accept\nconditions it would not normally accept had they not been in a financial\ncrisis in need of assistance.\n\nOn top of that, regardless of what methodologies and data sets used, it comes\nto same the conclusion of exacerbating income inequality. With Gini\ncoefficient, it became clear that countries with IMF policies face increased\nincome inequality.\n\nIt is claimed that conditionalities hinder social stability and hence inhibit\nthe stated goals of the IMF, while Structural Adjustment Programmes lead to an\nincrease in poverty in recipient countries. The IMF sometimes advocates\n\"austerity programmes\", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when\nthe economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing\nbudget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax\nrate. In _Globalization and Its Discontents_ , Joseph E. Stiglitz, former\nchief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these\npolicies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the\npurpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds\nfor countries to carry out Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF \"was not\nparticipating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and\nideology of the Western financial community.\"\n\nStiglitz concludes, \"Modern high-tech warfare is designed to remove physical\ncontact: dropping bombs from 50,000 feet ensures that one does not 'feel' what\none does. Modern economic management is similar: from one's luxury hotel, one\ncan callously impose policies about which one would think twice if one knew\nthe people whose lives one was destroying.\"\n\nThe researchers Eric Toussaint and Damien Millet argue that the IMF's policies\namount to a new form of colonisation that does not need a military presence:\n\n> Following the exigencies of the governments of the richest companies, the\n> IMF, permitted countries in crisis to borrow in order to avoid default on\n> their repayments. Caught in the debt's downward spiral, developing countries\n> soon had no other recourse than to take on new debt in order to repay the\n> old debt. Before providing them with new loans, at higher interest rates,\n> future leaders asked the IMF, to intervene with the guarantee of ulterior\n> reimbursement, asking for a signed agreement with the said countries. The\n> IMF thus agreed to restart the flow of the 'finance pump' on condition that\n> the concerned countries first use this money to reimburse banks and other\n> private lenders, while restructuring their economy at the IMF's discretion:\n> these were the famous conditionalities, detailed in the Structural\n> Adjustment Programmes. The IMF and its ultra-liberal experts took control of\n> the borrowing countries' economic policies. A new form of colonisation was\n> thus instituted. It was not even necessary to establish an administrative or\n> military presence; the debt alone maintained this new form of submission.\n\nInternational politics play an important role in IMF decision making. The\nclout of member states is roughly proportional to its contribution to IMF\nfinances. The United States has the greatest number of votes and therefore\nwields the most influence. Domestic politics often come into play, with\npoliticians in developing countries using conditionality to gain leverage over\nthe opposition to influence policy.\n\nAcademic Jeremy Garlick cites IMF loans to South Korea during the 1997 Asian\nfinancial crisis as widely perceived by the South Korean public as a debt-\ntrap. Garlick writes that the public was generally bitter about submitting to\nthe conditions imposed by the IMF, which required South Korea to radically\nrestructure its economy and consult with the IMF before making economic\ndecisions until the debt was repaid.\n\nIn 2016, the IMF's research department published a report titled\n\"Neoliberalism: Oversold?\" which, while praising some aspects of the\n\"neoliberal agenda\", claims that the organisation has been \"overselling\"\nfiscal austerity policies and financial deregulation, which they claim has\nexacerbated both financial crises and economic inequality around the world.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021, Oxfam criticized the IMF for forcing tough austerity\nmeasures on many low income countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite\nforcing cuts to healthcare spending, would hamper the recipient's response to\nthe pandemic."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The role of the Bretton Woods institutions has been controversial since the\nlate Cold War, because of claims that the IMF policy makers supported military\ndictatorships friendly to American and European corporations, but also other\nanti-communist and communist regimes, such as the Socialist Republic of\nRomania. An example of IMF's support for a dictatorship was its ongoing\nsupport for Mobutu's rule in Zaire, although its own envoy Erwin Blumenthal\nprovided a sobering report about the entrenched corruption and embezzlement\nand the inability of the country to pay back any loans. In 2021, the IMF\napproved a US$1 billion loan to the autocratic Uganda despite protests from\nUgandans in Washington, London and South Africa. Critics also claim that the\nIMF is generally apathetic or hostile to democracy, human rights, and labour\nrights. The controversy has helped spark the anti-globalization movement.\n\nArguments in favour of the IMF supporting dictatorships is the claim that\neconomic stability is a precursor to democracy. A 2017 study found no evidence\nof IMF lending programs undermining democracy in borrowing countries, it found\n\"evidence for modest but definitively positive conditional differences in the\ndemocracy scores of participating and non-participating countries\".\n\nA 2020 study found the reverse causality with democracy as a precursor to\neconomic stability. Critics highlight various examples in which democratised\ncountries fell after receiving IMF loans.\n\nParty-based autocracies and democracies can face similar incentives when\nconsidering agreements with IMF, in contrast to personalist and military\nregimes."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The scholarly consensus is that IMF decision-making is not simply\ntechnocratic, but also guided by political and economic concerns. The United\nStates is the IMF's most powerful member, and its influence reaches even into\ndecision-making concerning individual loan agreements. The U.S. has\nhistorically been openly opposed to losing what Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew\ndescribed in 2015 as its \"leadership role\" at the IMF, and the U.S.' \"ability\nto shape international norms and practices\".\n\nEmerging markets were not well-represented for most of the IMF's history:\nDespite being the most populous country, China's vote share was the sixth\nlargest; Brazil's vote share was smaller than Belgium's. Reforms to give more\npowers to emerging economies were agreed by the G20 in 2010. The reforms could\nnot pass, however, until they were ratified by the United States Congress,\nsince 85% of the Fund's voting power was required for the reforms to take\neffect, and the Americans held more than 16% of voting power at the time.\nAfter repeated criticism, the U.S. finally ratified the voting reforms at the\nend of 2015. The OECD countries maintained their overwhelming majority of\nvoting share, and the U.S. in particular retained its share at over 16%.\n\nThe criticism of the American- and European-dominated IMF has led to what some\nconsider \"disenfranchising the world\" from the governance of the IMF. Ra\u00fal\nPrebisch, the founding secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and\nDevelopment (UNCTAD), wrote that one of \"the conspicuous deficiencies of the\ngeneral economic theory, from the point of view of the periphery, is its false\nsense of universality\"."
