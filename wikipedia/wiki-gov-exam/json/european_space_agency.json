With its headquarters in Paris and\na staff of around 2,547 people globally as of 2023, ESA was founded in 1975 in\nthe context of European integration. Its 2025 annual budget was \u20ac7.7 billion.\n\nThe ESA Human and Robotic Exploration programme includes human spaceflight\n(mainly through participation in the International Space Station programme);\nas well as the launch and operation of missions to Mars and Moon. Further\nactivities include science missions to Jupiter, Mercury, the Sun, Earth\nobservation, Asteroid impact avoidance and Telecommunications missions,\ndesigning launch vehicles; and maintaining Europe's Spaceport, the Guiana\nSpace Centre at Kourou (French Guiana). Further programmes include space\nsafety, satellite navigation, applications and commercialisation.\n\nThe main European launch vehicle Ariane 6 is operated through Arianespace with\nESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing the launch\nvehicle. The agency also collaborates with NASA to manufacture the Orion\nspacecraft service module ESM which flies on the Space Launch System."

        "generated_section_content_md": "European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. ESTEC buildings in\nNoordwijk, Netherlands. ESTEC was the main technical centre of ESRO and\nremains so for the successor organisation (ESA).\n\nAfter World War II, many European scientists left Western Europe in order to\nwork with the United States. Although the 1950s boom made it possible for\nWestern European countries to invest in research and specifically in space-\nrelated activities, Western European scientists realised solely national\nprojects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958,\nonly months after the Sputnik shock, Edoardo Amaldi (Italy) and Pierre Auger\n(France), two prominent members of the Western European scientific community,\nmet to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The\nmeeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries.\n\nThe Western European nations decided to have two agencies: one concerned with\ndeveloping a launch system, ELDO (European Launcher Development Organisation),\nand the other the precursor of the European Space Agency, ESRO (European Space\nResearch Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an\nagreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven\nresearch satellites, but ELDO was not able to deliver a launch vehicle. Both\nagencies struggled with the underfunding and diverging interests of their\nparticipants.\n\nThe ESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when\nESRO was merged with ELDO. The ESA had ten founding member states: Belgium,\nDenmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, and the United Kingdom. These signed the ESA Convention in 1975\nand deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention\ncame into force. During this interval the agency functioned in a de facto\nfashion. ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975, Cos-B, a\nspace probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe, which was first\nworked on by ESRO."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Mock-up of the Ariane 1\n\nESA collaborated with NASA on the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE),\nthe world's first high-orbit telescope, which was launched in 1978 and\noperated successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit\nprojects followed, and in 1986 ESA began Giotto, its first deep-space mission,\nto study the comets Halley and Grigg\u2013Skjellerup. Hipparcos, a star-mapping\nmission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s SOHO, _Ulysses_ and the Hubble\nSpace Telescope were all jointly carried out with NASA. Later scientific\nmissions in cooperation with NASA include the _Cassini\u2013Huygens_ space probe,\nto which the ESA contributed by building the Titan landing module _Huygens_.\n\nAs the successor of ELDO, the ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific\nand commercial payloads. Ariane 1, launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial\npayloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two versions of the Ariane\nrocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch\nsystem, the Ariane 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established the\nESA as the world leader in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although\nthe succeeding Ariane 5 experienced a failure on its first flight, it has\nsince firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial\nspace launch market with 112 successful launches until 2023. The successor\nlaunch vehicle, Ariane 6, had its maiden flight on 9 July 2024. It was\nfollowed by flight VA263, the first commercial launch, on 6 March 2025 at\n13:24 local time (16:24 BST, 17:24 CET), delivering the Composante Spatiale\nOptique CSO-3 satellite.\n\nThe beginning of the new millennium saw the ESA become, along with agencies\nlike NASA, JAXA, ISRO, the CSA and Roscosmos, one of the major participants in\nscientific space research. Although ESA had relied on co-operation with NASA\nin previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as\ntough legal restrictions on information sharing by the United States military)\nled to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with Russia. A\n2011 press issue thus stated:\n\n> Russia was ESA's first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to\n> space. There is a framework agreement between ESA and the government of the\n> Russian Federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use\n> of outer space for peaceful purposes, and cooperation is already underway in\n> two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both\n> partners.\n\nNotable ESA programmes include SMART-1, a probe testing cutting-edge space\npropulsion technology, the _Mars Express_ and _Venus Express_ missions, as\nwell as the development of the Ariane 5 rocket and its role in the ISS\npartnership. The ESA maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for\nastronomy-space missions such as Corot, launched on 27 December 2006, a\nmilestone in the search for exoplanets.\n\nOn 21 January 2019, ArianeGroup and Arianespace announced a one-year contract\nwith the ESA to study and prepare for a mission to mine the Moon for lunar\nregolith.\n\nIn 2021 the ESA ministerial council agreed to the \"Matosinhos manifesto\" which\nset three priority areas (referred to as _accelerators_) \"space for a green\nfuture, a rapid and resilient crisis response, and the protection of space\nassets\", and two further high visibility projects (referred to as\n_inspirators_) an icy moon sample return mission; and human space exploration.\nIn the same year the recruitment process began for the 2022 European Space\nAgency Astronaut Group.\n\nThe first half of 2023 saw the launches of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer and\nthe Euclid spacecraft, the latter developed jointly with the Euclid\nConsortium. After 10 years of planning and building, it is designed to better\nunderstand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the\naccelerating expansion of the universe.\n\nThe most notable ESA mission of 2024 was Hera (space mission), which launched\non 7 October that year to perform a post-impact survey of the asteroid\nDimorphos which was deflected by NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test\nmission.\n\nIn early 2025, the European Space Agency released its Strategy 2040, a long-\nterm roadmap adopted by the ESA council to define the agency's priorities. The\nstrategy is centered on 5 key goals:\n\n* Protecting the planet and climate\n* Advancing space exploration\n* Strengthening European autonomy and resilience\n* Boosting economic growth and competitiveness\n* Inspiring future generations\n\nIn March 2025, ESA officially launched its European Launcher Challenge (ELC)\nby publishing the Invitation to Tender (ITT). Initially introduced in November\n2023, the program aims to foster new European sovereign launch capabilities,\nbeginning with small launch vehicles and ultimately paving the way for an\nAriane 6 successor."

Nations that want to\nbecome a full member of the ESA do so in 3 stages. First a Cooperation\nAgreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country\nhas very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to co-operate\nmore fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement,\nalbeit to be a candidate for said agreement, a country must be European. The\nECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation\nin ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes,\nexcept for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial\ncontribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than\nthat of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For\nEuropean Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of\nbasic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's\nspace industry capacity.

It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet\nEuropean in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was\nCzechoslovak Vladim\u00edr Remek who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or\nAmerican in space (the first man in space being Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet\nUnion) \u2013 on a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, followed by the Pole Miros\u0142aw\nHermaszewski and East German Sigmund J\u00e4hn in the same year. This Soviet co-\noperation programme, known as Intercosmos, primarily involved the\nparticipation of Eastern bloc countries. In 1982, however, Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien\nbecame the first non-Communist Bloc astronaut on a flight to the Soviet Salyut\n7 space station.\n\nBecause Chr\u00e9tien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but\nrather as a member of the French CNES astronaut corps, the German Ulf Merbold\nis considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in\nthe STS-9 Space Shuttle mission that included the first use of the European-\nbuilt Spacelab in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA\njoint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in\nthe following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded\nand organisationally and scientifically controlled by the ESA (such as two\nmissions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew\nmembers rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and\nseats on the shuttles, the ESA continued its human space flight co-operation\nwith the Soviet Union and later Russia, including numerous visits to Mir.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from\nbeing the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the European Astronaut\nCentre in Cologne, Germany was established. It selects and trains prospective\nastronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international\npartners, especially with regard to the International Space Station. As of\n2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including\nnationals from most large European countries except the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2008, the ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection\nwould be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut\ncandidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial\napplication criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the\nfirst stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192.\nAfter two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as\nwell as formal interviews, six new members of the European Astronaut Corps\nwere selected \u2013 five men and one woman."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the 1980s, France pressed for an independent European crew launch vehicle.\nAround 1978, it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting\nin November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of Hermes was\nintroduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the Space Shuttle\nand consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts\nand 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total\nmaximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the Ariane 5\nrocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use\nin low Earth orbit space flights. The planning and pre-development phase\nconcluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at\nthat time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of\nthe Soviet Union, the ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build\na next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in\n1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The Columbus space station\nprogramme had a similar fate.\n\nIn the 21st century, the ESA started new programmes in order to create its own\ncrew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is\nHopper, whose prototype by EADS, called Phoenix, has already been tested.\nWhile projects such as Hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within\nthe next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation\nwith the Russian Space Agency have emerged. Following talks with the Russian\nSpace Agency in 2004 and June 2005, a co-operation between the ESA and the\nRussian Space Agency was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed\nKliper, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond\nLEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance\npart of it. A \u20ac50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected\nto be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by ESA member\nstates. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in\n2006.\n\nIn June 2006, ESA member states granted 15 million to the Crew Space\nTransportation System (CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft\ncapable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the current Soyuz design.\nThis project was pursued with Roskosmos instead of the cancelled Kliper\nproposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS\nspacecraft was contemplated for 2008. In mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a\n\u20ac21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the European ATV\nwhich is believed to now be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation\nSystem design.\n\nIn November 2012, the ESA decided to join NASA's Orion programme. The ATV\nwould form the basis of a propulsion unit for NASA's new crewed spacecraft.\nThe ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion's launch system as well in\norder to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.\n\nIn September 2014, the ESA signed an agreement with Sierra Nevada Corporation\nfor co-operation in Dream Chaser project. Further studies on the Dream Chaser\nfor European Utilization or DC4EU project were funded, including the\nfeasibility of launching a Europeanised Dream Chaser onboard Ariane 5."

If we are to be\nsuccessful in our European strategy for space, and we will be, I will need the\nESA by my side.\" ESA director Aschbacher reciprocated, saying \"I would really\nlike to make the ESA the main agency, the go-to agency of the European\nCommission for all its flagship programmes.\" The ESA and EUSPA are now seen to\nhave distinct roles and competencies, which will be officialised in the\nFinancial Framework Partnership Agreement (FFPA). Whereas the ESA's focus will\nbe on the technical elements of the EU space programmes, the EUSPA will handle\nthe operational elements of those programmes."
