Secretariat that promotes and facilitates peaceful\ninternational cooperation in outer space. It works to establish or strengthen\nthe legal and regulatory frameworks for space activities, and assists\ndeveloping countries in using space science and technology for sustainable\nsocioeconomic development.\n\nThe Office was established in 1958 to assist and advise the _ad hoc_ Committee\non the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS), which was established by the UN\nGeneral Assembly to discuss the scientific and legal aspects of exploring and\nusing outer space to benefit humankind. The Committee became permanent the\nfollowing year, with UNOOSA undergoing several structural changes before its\nrelocation in 1993 to the United Nations Office in Vienna, Austria.\n\nAs the secretariat of COPUOS, the Office is responsible for helping implement\nthe major international treaties, legal principles, and General Assembly\nresolutions that together comprise space law. Other duties include advising\ngovernments and nongovernmental organizations on space law; maintaining a\nregistry of vessels and objects launched into space; convening forums to\ndiscuss various space-related matters; and sponsoring programmes that provide\naccess to space technology."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1957, the launching of _Sputnik 1_ prompted a global conversation and\ndebate on the legal, scientific, and political implications of space\nexploration.\n\nOn 13 December 1958, the _ad hoc_ Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer\nSpace (COPUOS) was established by the General Assembly in its resolution 1348\n(XIII), becoming a permanent body within the General Assembly. They soon met\nfor the first time to discuss a peaceful and legally ordered approach to space\nexploration. Concurrently, the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs\n(UNOOSA) was created as a small expert unit within the UN Secretariat in New\nYork to assist the Committee in its work.\n\nIn 1962, UNOOSA was moved to the Department of Political and Security Council\nAffairs (DPSCA), where it was transformed into the Outer Space Affairs\nDivision.\n\nIn 1967, the Outer Space Treaty, which had been developed by COPUOS, entered\ninto force, creating the first international legal framework governing the\nconduct of space activities.\n\nIn 1992, the Outer Space Affairs Division changed to its current form as the\nOffice for Outer Space Affairs, remaining within Department for Political\nAffairs and Peacebuilding (which succeeded the DPSCA). The following year,\nUNOOSA was relocated to its current headquarters at the United Nations Office\nat Vienna.\n\nAt the start of the 21st century, UNOOSA undertook initiatives and programs to\nfulfill its mandate of promoting widespread and peaceful international\ninvolvement in space. In 2005, the International Committee on Global\nNavigation Satellite Systems (ICG) was established to promote compatibility,\ninteroperability and transparency between all the satellite navigation\nsystems, particularly for developing nations. The following year, the UN-\nSPIDER programme was created to provide an accessible platform for developing\nstates to use space-based technologies for disaster management and emergency\nresponse. Two offices were established (in Bonn, Germany and Beijing, China)\nto further the programme's work.\n\nIn 2009, Japanese astronaut Takao Doi became Chief of Space Applications.\n\nIn 2010, the Human Space Initiative was launched to further UNOOSA's mission\nof providing developing countries with access to the use and exploration of\nspace.\n\nIn March 2014, the UN Secretary-General appointed Simonetta Di Pippo of Italy\nas Director of the Office, who had previously served as Director of Human\nSpaceflight at the European Space Agency.\n\nIn September 2015, pursuant to the Human Space Initiative, UNOOSA partnered\nwith the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to launch the \"KiboCUBE\"\nprogramme, which allows developing countries to deploy their own indigenously\nproduced CubeSats from the Japanese Kibo module on the International Space\nStation. Through the programme, Kenya and Guatemala launched their first\nsatellites in 2018 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOn 16 June 2016, UNOOSA announced a partnership with the China Manned Space\nAgency (CMSA) to give nations the opportunity to fly their experiments and\npersonnel on board the Chinese space station Tiangong.\n\nIn September 2016, UNOOSA announced the first United Nations space mission,\nwith an initial target launch date in 2021. The mission will utilize the Dream\nChaser spaceplane, designed by the American Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC),\nto enable developing nations to send microgravity payloads into low-Earth\norbit.\n\nIn 2019, the launch date for the proposed Dream Chaser mission, expected to\ncarry up to 35 payloads, was updated to sometime in 2024.\n\nOn 26 June 2023, Aarti Holla-Maini, former general secretary of Global\nSatellite Operators Association, was appointed as the current UNOOSA director."

The office has the\ndual objective of supporting the intergovernmental discussions in the\nCommittee and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee and Legal\nSubcommittee, and of assisting developing countries in using space technology\nfor development.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe mandate has been adjusted a number of times to allow the Office to\nundertake, among other tasks, the coordination of the inter-agency cooperation\nwithin the United Nations on the use of space technology - UN-Space\n(resolution 3234 implementing the United Nations Programme on Space\nApplications (resolution 2601A (XXIV)) and the UN-SPIDER Programme for\ndisaster risk management and emergency response (resolution 61/110).\n\nThe Office also coordinates and cooperates with space agencies and\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations involved in space-related\nactivities and, on behalf of the United Nations Secretary-General, the\nRegister of Objects Launched into Outer Space. The office also helps poor\nnations suffering from climate change related problems by helping them access\nsatellite images for free.[_citation needed_]"

        "generated_section_content_md": "UNOOSA is headed by a Director appointed by the UN Secretary-General, from\n2023 this is Aarti Holla-Maini of Belgium and the UK. The Director's Office is\nresponsible for public outreach, the Register on Objects in Outer Space, and\nprogrammes for youth engagement. It has two sections: the committee, Policy,\nand Legal Affairs (CPLA), headed by Takemi Chiku from Japan, and the Space\nApplications Section (SAS), headed by Lorant Czaran from Romania. The CPLA\nfulfills the Office's secretarial duties to the Committee on the Peaceful Uses\nof Outer Space, its subcommittees, and its working groups. It also convenes\nand services the Inter Agency Meeting on Outer Space Activities, known as UN-\nSpace, which is the central inter-agency coordination mechanisms in the UN\nsystem on overarching space matters. UN-Space meets annually to discuss\ncurrent and future activities, emergent technologies of interest, and other\nrelated matters, particularly regarding the global development agenda. The\nsection is concerned with the establishment of a legal and regulatory\nframework governing space activities, and actively fosters capacity-building\nin space law and policy.\n\nThe Space Applications Section works on building capacities in the practical\napplication of space technology and space-derived information for development.\nThe Programme concentrates its efforts on ensuring the equal access of all\ncountries to new space-based technologies, especially developing nations. To\nfacilitate the capacity building with focus on developing countries, the\noffice provides three initiatives:\n\n* The Human Space Initiative focuses on the public outreach to promote increased awareness among Member States to the benefits of space technology and its applications.\n* The Basic Space Technology Initiative enhances access to space application tools for sustainable development through building capacity in basic space technology.\n* The Basic Space Science Initiative supports the growth of small research groups in universities and research institutions in the developing countries in the fields of astronomy and space science.\n\nThe Programme also focuses efforts on the potential of space-based information\nfor disaster management and emergency response. The UN-SPIDER programme\n(established 2006) helps to achieve this objective by being a gateway to space\ninformation for disaster management support, serving as a bridge to connect\nthe disaster management and space communities and being a facilitator of\ncapacity-building and institutional strengthening, in particular for\ndeveloping countries.\n\nThe International Committee on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (ICG)\npromotes voluntary cooperation on matters of mutual interest related to civil\nsatellite-based positioning, navigation, timing, and value-added services. To\nsupport the work of ICG, the Office was designated as the Executive\nSecretariat of ICG. In that capacity, UNOOSA is organizing regional workshops,\ntraining courses, and international meetings focusing on capacity-building in\nthe use of GNSS-related technologies in various rapidly growing fields of\nscience and industry."
