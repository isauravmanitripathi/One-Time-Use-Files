As the establishment of a development bank would\nhelp in simplifying mutual settlement and lending operations amongst the BRICS\nnations, reducing dependence on the US dollar and the Euro, the leaders of\nthese nations agreed to set up anew multilateral development bank at the 5th\nBRICS summit held in Durban, South Africa on 27 March 2013. On 15 July 2014,\non the first day of the 6th BRICS summit held in Fortaleza, Brazil, the five\nmember states signed the agreement on the New Development Bank, which made\nprovisions for the legal basis of the bank. In a separate agreement, a reserve\ncurrency pool worth US$100 billion was set up by the members.\n\nThe president of the New Development Bank K.V. Kamath with the Indian prime\nminister Narendra Modi in May 2015\n\nOn 11 May 2015, K. V. Kamath was appointed as the first president of the bank.\nAccording to the bank, the policies and procedures for all functional areas\nwere approved at the board of directors meeting in January 2016. On 27\nFebruary 2016, the NDB signed an agreement with the Government of China and\nlocal government of Shanghai to establish the headquarters of the bank in\nShanghai. On 19 July 2016, the NDB reported that it successfully issued the\nbank's first green financial bond with issue size of RMB 3 billion, with a\ntenure of five years in the China interbank bond market.\n\nNDB Creation Milestones\n\nOn 20 July 2016, the first annual meeting of the NDB board of governors was\nheld in Shanghai. The participants of the meeting discussed the bank's future\nwork and development and gave a positive assessment to the bank's work. At the\nmeeting, the first green financial bond issuance in renminbi was highlighted\nas a milestone event for the NDB. In 2016, the NDB board of directors approved\nthe first set of projects in all members of the bank. On 21 December 2016, the\nNDB signed its first loan agreement. The NDB received AA+ credit ratings from\nS&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) in August 2018, which\nenables the bank to offer full suite of financial products to its public and\nprivate sector clients. In April 2020, the New Development Bank established an\nEmergency Assistance Facility that sought to finance costs related to the\nfight against the Coronavirus and soften the blow from the economic impact. In\naddition to committing US$5 billion to this cause, the NDB targeted to provide\nup to 10 billion dollars.\n\nIn March 2022, the NDB announced that \"sound banking principles\" required that\nall new transactions with Russia be put on hold. Even though the NDB quickly\ncut ties with Russia, Fitch Ratings still downgraded the NDB from stable to\nnegative on its Long-Term Issuer Default scale. In May 2022, the New\nDevelopment Bank set up a regional office in India in the state of Gujarat\nwith the goal of financing and observing infrastructure projects in both India\nand Bangladesh. In May 2023, Saudi Arabia expressed its intention to join the\nNDB."
