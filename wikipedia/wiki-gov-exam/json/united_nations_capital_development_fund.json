It\nreceived about $40 million in core funding per year and operated out of UNDP\ncountry offices.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, UNCDF began focusing on the role local governments could\nplay in planning, financing, and maintaining capital investments. Promoting\neffective infrastructure investment and service delivery via decentralized\npublic financial management has been UNCDF's mainstay ever since. UNCDF's\nother major area of expertise\u2014microfinance\u2014also dates to the mid-1990s, when\nmany of its rural development projects had credit components.\n\nUNCDF's resources remain modest compared to many multilateral organizations.\nHowever, it has developed a considerable track record of going where others do\nnot, and then \u201cleveraging in\u201d larger sources of public and private capital. In\nthe words of a 2008 assessment by the Government of Sweden, \u201c _UNCDF should be\nseen as a development actor that paves the way for others, rather than a\nfinancing mechanism._ \u201d\n\nIn 2013, UNCDF received the highest score in the SmartAid for Microfinance\nIndex, a measure of overall effectiveness in microfinance."
