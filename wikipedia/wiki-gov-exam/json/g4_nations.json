        "generated_section_content_md": "Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan in the UN\n\nThe **G4 nations,** comprising Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, are four\ncountries which support each other's bids for permanent seats on the United\nNations Security Council. Unlike the G7, where the common denominator is the\neconomy and long-term political motives, the G4's primary aim is the permanent\nmember seats on the Security Council. Each of these four countries have\nfigured among the elected non-permanent members of the council since the UN's\nestablishment. Their economic, political and military influence has grown\nsignificantly in the last decades, reaching a scope comparable to the\npermanent members (P5). However, the G4's bids are often opposed by the\nUniting for Consensus movement led by Italy, and particularly their economic\ncompetitors or political rivals."

The Council on Foreign\nRelations recommended that the U.S. government fully endorse the inclusion of\nBrazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. Brazil has received\nbacking from three of the current permanent members, namely France, Russia,\nand the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the final document of the 2019 BRICS summit, China and Russia say they\n\"reiterate the importance of a comprehensive Security Council reform\" and\n\"support Brazil and India's aspiration for more relevant UN roles\".\n\nAs stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov at the Raisina\nDialogue in New Delhi in January 2020: \"I would say the Security Council's\nmain shortcoming is the under-representation of developing countries.

Uniting for Consensus supports\nexpanding the number of non-permanent security council members and restricting\nthe usage of the veto. The bloc argues that adding more permanent seats to the\nsecurity council only benefits the nations that gain those seats, and believes\nthat an expansion of the non-permanent membership will make the UNSC both more\nflexible and more democratic.\n\nIn Latin America countries, Colombia,[_citation needed_] Mexico[_citation\nneeded_] and Argentina opposes a seat for Brazil. In Asia, Pakistan opposes\nIndia's bid.\n\nAnother counter-proposal, the Ezulwini Consensus, was presented by the African\nUnion, calling for the addition of five new non-permanent seats and two new\npermanent seats to be allocated to African nations, in response to a lack of\nAfrican representation on the Security Council."

In several conferences during the summer of\n2005, African Union was unable to agree on two nominees: Egypt, Nigeria and\nSouth Africa all lay claim to a permanent African UNSC seat.\n\nA UN General Assembly in September 2005 marked the 60th anniversary of the UN\nand the members were to decide on a number of necessary reforms\u2014including the\nenlarged Security Council. However the unwillingness to find a negotiable\nposition stopped even the most urgent reforms; the September 2005 General\nAssembly was a setback for the UN.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe G4 retain their goal of permanent UNSC membership for all four nations\n(plus two African nations). In January 2006, Japan announced it would not\nsupport putting the G4 resolution back on the table, not to interfere with any\neffort by the African Union to unite behind a single plan. And meanwhile,\nJapan's continuing relations with the G4 were not mutually exclusive. G4\nissued a joint statement on 12 February 2011, in which their foreign ministers\nagreed to seek concrete outcome in the current session of the UN General\nAssembly.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn September 2015, Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, invited the\nleaders of the G4 for a summit following the adoption of UN General Assembly\nDecision 69/560 by consensus, which moved forward for the first time. In 2017,\nit was reported that the G4 nations were willing to temporarily forgo veto\npower if granted a permanent UNSC seat.\n\nIn September 2019, in a joint press statement during the 74th session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly, the G4 ministers reiterated their strong\ncommitment to an early and comprehensive reform of the UNSC. Bearing in mind\nthat in 2020 the United Nations would celebrate its 75th anniversary, the G4\nministers also expressed their firm hope that the current session of the\nGeneral Assembly would pave the way for finally moving on the call for an\n\u2018early reform\u2019 of the Security Council and underscored their steadfast support\nfor Africa's representation in both the permanent and non-permanent categories\nof membership of a future reform.\n\nIn September 2023, in a joint press statement during the 78th session of the\nUnited Nations General Assembly, the foreign ministers of G4, joined to\ndiscuss the state of play of the negotiations for the reform of the UNSC, and\nreiterated that the expansion of the Security Council is essential to make the\nbody more representative, legitimate, effective and efficient, adding that\nAfrica needs to be represented in both the permanent and non-permanent\ncategories of membership of a reformed and expanded Council."
