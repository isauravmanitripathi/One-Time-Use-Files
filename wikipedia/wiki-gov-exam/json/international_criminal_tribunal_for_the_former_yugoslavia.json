The tribunal was an _ad hoc_ court located in The Hague,\nNetherlands.\n\nIt was established by Resolution 827 of the United Nations Security Council,\nwhich was passed on 25 May 1993. It had jurisdiction over four clusters of\ncrimes committed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991: grave\nbreaches of the Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of war,\ngenocide, and crimes against humanity. The maximum sentence that it could\nimpose was life imprisonment. Various countries signed agreements with the\nUnited Nations to carry out custodial sentences.\n\nA total of 161 persons were indicted; the final indictments were issued in\nDecember 2004, the last of which were confirmed and unsealed in the spring of\n2005. The final fugitive, Goran Had\u017ei\u0107, was arrested on 20 July 2011. The\nfinal judgment was issued on 29 November 2017 and the institution formally\nceased to exist on 31 December 2017.\n\nResidual functions of the ICTY, including the oversight of sentences and\nconsideration of any appeal proceedings initiated since 1 July 2013, are under\nthe jurisdiction of a successor body, the International Residual Mechanism for\nCriminal Tribunals (IRMCT)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1993 the internal infrastructure of the ICTY was built. 17 states had\nsigned an agreement with the ICTY to carry out custodial sentences.\n\n1993\u20131994: In the first year of its existence, the tribunal laid the\nfoundations for its existence as a judicial organ. It established the legal\nframework for its operations by adopting the rules of procedure and evidence,\nas well as its rules of detention and directive for the assignment of defence\ncounsel. Together, these rules established a legal aid system for the\ntribunal. As the ICTY was a part of the United Nations and was the first\n_international_ court for _criminal_ justice, the development of a juridical\ninfrastructure was considered quite a challenge. However, after the first\nyear, the first ICTY judges had drafted and adopted all the rules for court\nproceedings.\n\n1994\u20131995: The ICTY established its offices within the Aegon Insurance\nBuilding in The Hague (which was, at the time, still partially in use by\nAegon) and detention facilities in Scheveningen in The Hague (the\nNetherlands). The ICTY hired many staff members and by July 1994, the Office\nof the Prosecutor had sufficient staff to begin field investigations. By\nNovember 1994, the first indictments were presented to the court and\nconfirmed, and in 1995, the staff numbered over 200 persons from all over the\nworld."

This was followed on 13 February 1995 by two\nindictments comprising 21 individuals which were issued against a group of 21\nBosnian-Serbs charged with committing atrocities against Muslim and Croat\ncivilian prisoners. While the war in the former Yugoslavia was still raging,\nthe ICTY prosecutors showed that an international court was viable. However,\nno accused was arrested.\n\nThe court confirmed eight indictments against 46 individuals and issued arrest\nwarrants. Bosnian Serb indictee Du\u0161ko Tadi\u0107 became the subject of the\ntribunal's first trial. Tadi\u0107 was arrested by German police in Munich in 1994\nfor his alleged actions in the Prijedor region in Bosnia-Herzegovina\n(especially his actions in the Omarska, Trnopolje and Keraterm detention\ncamps). He made his first appearance before the ICTY Trial Chamber on 26 April\n1995, and pleaded not guilty to all of the charges in the indictment.\n\n1995\u20131996: Between June 1995 and June 1996, 10 public indictments had been\nconfirmed against a total of 33 individuals. Six of the newly indicted persons\nwere transferred in the tribunal's detention unit. In addition to Du\u0161ko Tadic,\nby June 1996 the tribunal had Tihomir Bla\u0161ki\u0107, Dra\u017een Erdemovi\u0107, Zejnil\nDelali\u0107, Zdravko Muci\u0107, Esad Land\u017eo and Hazim Deli\u0107 in custody.

Resolution 1966 called\nupon the tribunal to finish its work by 31 December 2014 to prepare for its\nclosure and the transfer of its responsibilities.\n\nIn a _Completion Strategy Report_ issued in May 2011, the ICTY indicated that\nit aimed to complete all trials by the end of 2012 and complete all appeals by\n2015, with the exception of Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 whose trial was expected to end\nin 2014 and Ratko Mladi\u0107 and Goran Had\u017ei\u0107, who were still at large at that\ntime and were not arrested until later that year.\n\nThe IRMCT's ICTY branch began functioning on 1 July 2013. Per the Transitional\nArrangements adopted by the UN Security Council, the ICTY was to conduct and\ncomplete all outstanding first-instance trials, including those of Karad\u017ei\u0107,\nMladi\u0107 and Had\u017ei\u0107. The ICTY would also conduct and complete all appeal\nproceedings for which the notice of appeal against the judgement or sentence\nwas filed before 1 July 2013. The IRMCT will handle any appeals for which\nnotice is filed after that date.\n\nThe final ICTY trial to be completed in the first instance was that of Ratko\nMladi\u0107, who was convicted on 22 November 2017. The final case to be considered\nby the ICTY was an appeal proceeding encompassing six individuals, whose\nsentences were upheld on 29 November 2017."

Please help integrate negative information into other\nsections or remove undue focus on minor aspects through discussion on the talk\npage. _( March 2022)_\n---|---\n\nCriticisms of the court include:\n\nThe critique concerning the ICTY can be divided into claims pertaining to its\ncreation, the fairness of its prosecution (who was accused and whom the\nprosecution failed to accuse although it should have issued indictments),\ntrial fairness (who was sentenced, who was accused and whom the chambers\nfailed to sentence or acquit although they should have done so) and the\nfairness of the procedures (did the parties have equal rights and equal\nopportunities to bring their evidence and arguments) and the court's\nefficiency (how much time and resources did the court use to achieve its aims\n\u2013 and did it achieve these aims).\n\nSome researchers have argued the ICTY was biased, but could not reasonably\navoid bias, because of the highly political and ethnically polarised\nenvironment in which it had to work. Usually, as Mirko Klarin has set out, the\nethnic or national community, which sided with an accused, regarded his (or,\nin a few cases, her) trial as unfair assuming him to be innocent, while it\nregarded trials against its former enemies as a priori as justified. Under\nsuch circumstances, as Bachmann and Fati\u0107 have argued, the only way to avoid\naccusations of bias, would have been to indict either nobody, or all those,\nwhom the ethnic communities in postwar Yugoslavia regarded as guilty \u2013 neither\nway was feasible for the ICTY. Other researchers have emphasized some of the\nharsh criticism against the ICTY (and partly also the ICTR) to stem from its\norgans' reluctance to openly accept and enforce its political rather than\njudicial mandate: the tribunal pretended to do a judicial job while actually\n(and inevitably so) doing a political job by judging politicians and\nmilitaries who otherwise would have enjoyed impunity in their home countries.\nThese critics have instead stipulated international criminal tribunals should\nendorse their political mission and should not even try to hide it and instead\nof selecting indictments and accused persons according to criteria of gravity\nwhich reflect the alleged share of an ethnic communities participation in\natrocities, they should indict the same number of leaders of each community\ninvolved in atrocities at the beginning and leave the question open which\ncommunity they regard as collective victim or collective perpetrator of these\natrocities. As Bachmann and Fati\u0107 have shown, this was rather an exercise of\ncollective stereotyping than a diagnosis rooted in thorough statistical rigor\nabout perpetrators and victimhood.\n\nCriticism concerning the ICTY's creation:\n\n* Some authors have argued (almost from the ICTY's beginning) the UN Security Council lacked the competence to create a tribunal, because the UN-Charter does not grant it the right to create judicial institutions at all. Some of the defendants, such as Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, claimed that the court has no legal authority because it was established by the UN Security Council instead of the UN General Assembly and so had not been created on a broad international basis. The tribunal was established on the basis of Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter; the relevant portion of which reads \"the Security Council can take measures to maintain or restore international peace and security\". The legal criticism has been succinctly stated in a memorandum issued by Austrian Professor Hans K\u00f6chler, which was submitted to the president of the Security Council in 1999. British Conservative Party MEP Daniel Hannan has called for the court to be abolished, claiming it is anti-democratic and a violation of national sovereignty. British author John Laughland has levelled similar criticism mainly focusing on the Milosevic Trial.\n\nCriticism concerning the fairness of the prosecution:\n\n* Carla Del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the tribunal, said in 2021 that the US did not want the ICTY to scrutinise war crimes committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army. According to her, Madeleine Albright, the United States secretary of state at the time, told her to slow down the investigation of Ramush Haradinaj.\n* Michael Mandel, William Blum and others accused the court of having a pro-NATO bias due to its refusal to prosecute NATO officials and politicians for war crimes. Bachmann and Fati\u0107 have shown how the prosecution blurred existing ICTY procedures to avoid indictment NATO officials despite the existing prima faciae evidence about war crimes. It did so under intense pressure from NATO representatives.\n* Bachmann and Fati\u0107 have shown how the prosecution failed to indict high ranking politicians and militaries mentioned in other indictments as co-perpetrators, because they agreed to assist the prosecution or agreed to testify against other accused persons. According to Hoare, a former employee at the ICTY, an investigative team worked on indictments of senior members of the \"joint criminal enterprise\", including not only Milo\u0161evi\u0107 but also Veljko Kadijevi\u0107, Blagoje Ad\u017ei\u0107, Borisav Jovi\u0107, Branko Kosti\u0107, Momir Bulatovi\u0107 and others. However, Hoare claims that, due to Carla del Ponte's intervention, these drafts were rejected, and the indictment limited to Milo\u0161evi\u0107 alone. Reducing the indictment charges after the arrest of Ratko Mladi\u0107, Croatian officials publicly condemned chief prosecutor Serge Brammertz for his announcement that the former Bosnian Serb General would be tried solely for crimes allegedly committed in Bosnia, not in Croatia.\n\nCriticism concerning trial fairness:\n\nTo create a formalistic impression of fairness, trial chambers often divided\nthe anticipated time of trial into equal parts for the prosecution and the\ndefense. But behind this fa\u00e7ade of equality, there were some structural\ndeficits which played out to the detriment of the defense. First of all, the\ndefense was no formal part of the tribunal; the ICTY statute did not mention\nthe defense as an organ of the tribunal and defense lawyers did not have\naccess to the securitized part of the ICTY building, but instead had to work\noutside, having only a small room in the lobby at their disposal. While the\nprosecution could draw from the tribunal resources when conducting\ninvestigations and invoke the authority of the tribunal in contacts with\nnational jurisdictions (demanding access to documents and witnesses and the\nsurrender of suspects), the defense could only rely on other states' goodwill\nand informal contacts.\n\nFor a long time (until the 2010s) neither prosecution nor chambers regarded it\nas the ICTY's job to prosecute contempt of court and false testimonies\ncommitted by witnesses. Their hesitance created incentives for the creation\nand expansion of perjurer networks and the creation of false evidence by\neither people, who wanted to see an accused sentenced (if he or she came from\nan enemy group) or acquitted (if he or she stemmed from their own ethnic\nbackground). Chambers regarded the prosecution of false testimony in court as\nbeing outside their core mandate and made contradictory decisions about who\nshould prevent false testimony (the prosecution or the chambers) and how.\nInstead of initiating sanctions against perjurers, judges were eager to\n\"explain false testimony away\" as examples of cultural exceptions or trauma\n(Combs and Bachmann).\n\n* On 6 December 2006, the Tribunal at The Hague approved the use of force-feeding of Serbian politician Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj. They decided it was not \"torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading\".\n* 68% of indictees have been Serbs, to the extent that a sizeable portion of the Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb political and military leaderships have been indicted. Some authors see this as a reflection of bias (often by the whole tribunal, although the decisions were only made by the prosecution. The chambers could not initiate prosecutions on their own). More precise statistical analysis show, there indeed were some statistical imbalances among prosecutions (and, as a result, convictions): the percentage of accused persons from the Serb part of Bosnia and from Serbia was higher than these entities share in the overall population of the countries under ICTY jurisdiction, no Bosnian Croat was ever convicted by the ICTY (Slobodan Praljak poisoned himself during the pronouncement of his appeal judgment), which also convicted only very few Kosovo Albanians, Macedonians and Montenegrins and no Slovenians. Some authors have seen these imbalances as indicative of the actual proportion of crimes committed, however, the very distribution of crimes among the ethnic communities depends largely on the concept of identity one applies to it: \"Serbs\" committed most of the crimes during the conflict if one puts all Serbs, holding different citizenships and living in the different parts of the former Yugoslavia (Republic of Serbia, Republika Srpska, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro) into one \"Serb\" basket. They cease to be the main collective culprits if one regards them as members of different communities (Bosnian Serbs, Serbs from Croatia, Serbs from Serbia and Montenegro etc). The same is true for Croats, depending if they are regarded as one nation across national boundaries or members of different communities (Croats from Croatia, Croats from Bosnia or Croats from Montenegro. Efficiency: ICTY publications usually measure efficiency in terms of the part of indicted persons who were put on trial. From that perspective, the ICTY was very efficient, because it managed to get hold on all the persons for which it had issued arrest warrants. However, trials used to be very long and cumbersome, with some trials re-tried from scratch pursuant to appeals chamber decisions. Critics have argued some of the trials were longer than the benchmarks set by the relevant European Court of Human Rights' verdicts (which are legally not binding for the ICTY). This was partly due to the need to provide the accused (and the witnesses) with translations in languages they understood (some accused, like Voislav Sesel, tried to sabotage their trials by claiming not to understand the translation, for example when the translator spoke Croatian rather than Serbian), but \u2013 as Boas has pointed out - it was also a consequence of the chambers inconsistent approach to self-representation, the use of amici curiae and imposed defense counselling for accused persons who refused to accept duty counselling without having their own defense lawyers. In some cases \u2013 the Milosevic trial is one example \u2013 the health conditions of an accused forced the judges to lower the workload for the accused and prolonged the trial beyond the anticipated amount of time.\n* Critics have questioned whether the tribunal exacerbates tensions rather than promotes reconciliation, as is claimed by tribunal supporters. Polls show a generally negative reaction to the tribunal among both Serbs and Croats. A majority of Serbs and Croats have expressed doubts regarding the ICTY's integrity and question the tenability of its legal procedures.\n* In the Muslim part of Bosnia and Kosovo support for the ICTY and its mission was usually much higher than in Croatia and Serbia. In the latter, respondents tended to associate the ICTY with NATO (and used to take sides with the suspects from their own ethnic community) while in the Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina and in Kosovo, they saw the ICTY as an instrument of Europeanisation. As Bachmann has shown, support for the ICTY in polls was usually strongly negatively correlated with the number of community members sentenced by the ICTY.\n* Part and parcel of the problems to establish, if the ICTY has contributed to reconciliation are the underlying concepts of reconciliation: some authors equate reconciliation with doing impartial justice, assuming tribunal decision will be endorsed by victims, perpetrators and the broader public if they are issued in accordance with generally accepted rules, while others rely on empirically tested concepts of public legitimacy and then usually find that ICTY decisions only were accepted by the members of a community if they fulfilled their expectations (that is: exonerated community members and sentenced leaders of the enemy group). Research has shown that prosecutors usually did not pay much attention to reconciliation and usually understood it as giving victims a voice (Carla Del Ponte) and punishing perpetrators, while judges did not see reconciliation as an important goal of their work and usually saw the punishment of perpetrators (and satisfying victims) as more important than the perpetrators re-integration into society. The latter concept only played a role in decision of two judges from Southern Africa (Bachmann, Botero, Lambertz). A research project conducted at SWPS University in Poland between 2012 and 2018 discovered some originally unintended (by the UN and the tribunal organs) impact of ICTY decisions on the ground: in some cases (Croatia and the Serb community of Bosnia) trial verdicts (concerning the Gotovina and the Visegrad cases) triggered more emphasis on victims from beyond the own ethnic community in these communities' media frames. The project also showed how the ICTY had inclined judicial and administrative reform in some countries under its jurisdiction, either in order to curb the ICTY's principle of primacy (the ICTY could take over any suspect it wanted from a country under its jurisdiction, but governments usually tried to convince the ICTY they could try their suspects themselves) or to adopt to the ICTY completion strategy, under which domestic judiciaries could take over cases from the ICTY but needed to prove they could cope with them. While some of these policy changes (triggered by the ICTY, ICTR and the ICC) remained ambiguous in other parts of the world, they usually led to lasting change in the countries of the former Yugoslavia, because they were bolstered by pressure and support from the European Union and the US (Kemp, Risti\u0107). Other points of criticism:\n* The interactive thematic debate on the role of international criminal justice in reconciliation was convened on 10 April 2013 by the President of the General Assembly, Vuk Jeremi\u0107, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia during the resumed part of the GA's 67th Session. The debate was scheduled after the convictions of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Marka\u010d for inciting war crimes against Serbs in Croatia were overturned by an ICTY Appeals Panel in November 2012. The ICTY president Theodor Meron announced that all three Hague war crimes courts turned down the invitation of UNGA president to participate in the debate about their work. The President of the General Assembly, Jeremi\u0107, described Meron's refusal to participate in this debate as scandalous. He emphasized that he does not shy away from criticizing the ICTY, which has \"convicted nobody for inciting crimes committed against Serbs in Croatia.\" Jeremi\u0107, who served as president of the General Assembly in his capacity as Serbian foreign minister, was effectively speaking on behalf of the Serbian government when making such statements and his views do not necessarily reflect those of the UN General Assembly. Tomislav Nikoli\u0107, the president of Serbia criticized the ICTY, claiming it did not contribute but hindered reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. He added that although there is no significant ethnic disproportion among the number of casualties in the Yugoslav wars, the ICTY sentenced Serbs and ethnic Serbs to a combined total of 1150 years in prison while claiming that members of other ethnic groups have been sentenced to a total of 55 years for crimes against Serbs. Vitaly Churkin, the ambassador of Russia to the UN, criticized the work of the ICTY, especially the overturned convictions of Gotovina and Ramush Haradinaj.\n* There have been allegations of censorship: in July 2011, the Appeals Chamber of ICTY confirmed the judgment of the Trial Chamber which found journalist and former tribunal's OTP spokesperson Florence Hartmann guilty of contempt of court and fined her \u20ac7,000. She disclosed documents of FR Yugoslavia's Supreme Defense Council meetings and criticized the tribunal for granting confidentiality of some information in them to protect Serbia's 'vital national interests' during Bosnia's lawsuit against the country for genocide in front of the International Court of Justice. Hartmann argued that Serbia was freed of the charge of genocide because ICTY redacted certain information in the council meetings. Since these documents have in the meantime been made public by the ICTY itself, a group of organizations and individuals, who supported her, said that the tribunal in this appellate proceedings \"imposed a form of censorship aimed to protect the international judges from any form of criticism\". (France refused to extradite Hartmann to serve the prison sentence issued against her by the ICTY after she refused to pay the \u20ac7,000 fine.).\n* Klaus-Peter Willsch compared the Ante Gotovina verdict, in which the late Croatian president Franjo Tu\u0111man was posthumously found to have been participating in a Joint Criminal Enterprise, with the 897 Cadaver Synod trial in Rome, when Pope Stephen VI had the corpse of Pope Formosus exhumed, put on trial and posthumously convicted.\n* Some sentences have been considered too mild, even within the tribunal, complained at small sentences of convicted war criminals in comparison with their crimes. In 2010, Veselin \u0160ljivan\u010danin's sentence for his involvement in the Vukovar massacre was cut from 17 to 10 years, which caused outrage in Croatia. Upon hearing that news, Vesna Bosanac, who had been in charge of the Vukovar hospital during the fall of the city, said that the \"ICTY is dead\" for her: \"For crimes that he [\u0160ljivan\u010danin], had committed in Vukovar, notably at Ov\u010dara, he should have been jailed for life. I'm outraged.... The Hague(-based) tribunal has showed again that it is not a just tribunal.\" Danijel Rehak, the head of Croatian Association of Prisoners in Serbian Concentration Camps, said, \"The shock of families whose beloved ones were killed at Ov\u010dara is unimaginable. The court made a crucial mistake by accepting a statement of a JNA officer to whom \u0160ljivan\u010danin was a commander. I cannot understand that\". Pavle Strugar's 8-year sentence for shelling of Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, also caused outrage in Croatia. Judge Kevin Parker (of Australia) was named in a Croatian journal (Nacional) as a main cause of the system's failure for having dismissed the testimonies of numerous witnesses.\n* The interactive thematic debate on the role of international criminal justice in reconciliation was convened on 10 April 2013 by the President of the General Assembly, Vuk Jeremi\u0107, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia during the resumed part of the GA's 67th Session. The debate was scheduled after the convictions of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Marka\u010d for inciting war crimes against Serbs in Croatia were overturned by an ICTY Appeals Panel in November 2012. The ICTY president Theodor Meron announced that all three Hague war crimes courts turned down the invitation of UNGA president to participate in the debate about their work. The President of the General Assembly, Jeremi\u0107, described Meron's refusal to participate in this debate as scandalous. He emphasized that he does not shy away from criticizing the ICTY, which has \"convicted nobody for inciting crimes committed against Serbs in Croatia.\" Jeremi\u0107, who served as president of the General Assembly in his capacity as Serbian foreign minister, was effectively speaking on behalf of the Serbian government when making such statements and his views do not necessarily reflect those of the UN General Assembly. Tomislav Nikoli\u0107, the president of Serbia criticized the ICTY, claiming it did not contribute but hindered reconciliation in the former Yugoslavia. He added that although there is no significant ethnic disproportion among the number of casualties in the Yugoslav wars, the ICTY sentenced Serbs and ethnic Serbs to a combined total of 1150 years in prison while claiming that members of other ethnic groups have been sentenced to a total of 55 years for crimes against Serbs. Vitaly Churkin, the ambassador of Russia to the UN, criticized the work of the ICTY, especially the overturned convictions of Gotovina and Ramush Haradinaj.\n* Regarding the final case on 29 November 2017 proceeding encompassing six Bosnian-Croat individuals, one of whom, Slobodan Praljak, in protest in court drank poison and subsequently died, the Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 claimed the verdict was \"unjust\" and Praljak's suicide \"speaks of deep moral injustice to the six Croats, from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croat people\". He criticized the verdict because it did not recognize the assistance and support provided by Croatia to Bosnia and Herzegovina and the collaboration of both armies at a time when the neighbouring state was faced with the \"Greater-Serbian aggression\" and when its territorial integrity was compromised, as well it alludes to the link between the then leadership of the Republic of Croatia, while in the previous verdict to Bosnian-Serb Ratko Mladi\u0107 does not recognize the connection with Serbia's state officials at that time.\n* Dutch filmmaker Jos de Putter made a trilogy, The Milosevic Case \u2013 Glosses at Trial, for Tegenlicht investigative slot at the VPRO. The main hypothesis of the film is that ICTY prosecution has been struggling and failing to prove any link between Milosevic and the media version of the truth of the bloody break-up of Yugoslavia. The legitimacy of the prosecution methodology in securing the witness accounts and evidence, in general, has been examined by the filmmaker.[_citation needed_]\n* The political embedding of the ICTY in international politics and the compromises with the interest of justice this embeddedness requires from prosecutors and judges is the topic of the German movie \"Storm\" which uses anecdotes from the Gotovina case (but presents them as if the case's main culprit were a Serbian general and constantly mixes Republika Srpska with the Republic of Serbia)."
