UNRISD was established in 1963 with the\nmandate of conducting policy-relevant research on social development that is\npertinent to the work of the United Nations Secretariat, regional commissions\nand specialized agencies, and national institutions.\n\nA small team of researchers coordinates UNRISD's research programmes, which\nfocus primarily on the developing world, working in collaboration with\nnational research teams from local universities and research institutes. The\nInstitute's work takes a holistic, multidisciplinary and political economy\napproach. UNRISD's location at the United Nations Office at Geneva gives\nresearchers access to channels of policy influence through active\nparticipation in events, meetings, conferences and working groups."

        "generated_section_content_md": "UNRISD was established in 1963 \"to conduct research into problems and policies\nof social development, and relationships between various types of social\ndevelopment and economic development\". It was originally set up with a grant\nfrom the Government of the Netherlands, and its first Board Chair was the\neminent economist Jan Tinbergen, who received the first-ever Nobel Prize for\neconomics in 1969.\n\nUNRISD's initial research focused on the design of indicators to measure\ndevelopment not just in terms of economic growth but also social factors, such\nas nutrition, health and education. As such, it employed many statisticians in\nits early years. Another early project focused on cooperatives as a tool for\ndevelopment, which produced some controversial results.\n\nIn the 1970s, global population growth made food production, supply and\neventually food systems into a key topic in development. UNRISD's work on the\nso-called Green Revolution (the introduction of newly bred high-yield grain\nseeds to increase food production) took a typically critical view. It\nhighlighted the fact that the quantity of food available was only one factor\nin ensuring populations in developing countries were not subject to hunger.\nPower inequalities impacting on the distribution of foodstuffs played a key\nrole in determining who got enough to eat and who didn't.\n\nBy the 1980s, UNRISD was growing in size, in terms of both funding and\nstaffing. Its remit diversified to cover popular participation and refugee\nissues, gradually leaving some of its early preoccupation with statistics\nbehind.\n\nIn the 1990s UNRISD thrived. A wide range of topics were addressed, ranging\nfrom political violence to the socioeconomic impact of illicit drugs.\nGlobalization in the modern era and structural adjustment programmes in\ndeveloping countries brought about social crises which UNRISD researched and\ncriticized, arguing that unregulated markets required a healthy public sector\nand stable governance to function properly.\n\nEnvironmental issues took firm root in development debates during this decade.\nUNRISD's take was typically critical: whatever the benefits of conservation,\nit was often happening at the expense of social justice and the livelihoods of\nminorities.\n\nIn the 2000s, as globalization continued apace and social dimensions began to\nbe re-introduced in the face of the sometimes catastrophic impacts of wide-\nranging economic liberalization, UNRISD criticized a narrow social policy\nfocus on safety nets and the targeting of vulnerable groups, arguing instead\nin favour of universal transformative social policy.\n\nIn the 2010s, the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by\nUN member states in 2015 established new global roadmap for development.\nUNRISD continued to work on social policy, often in conjunction with questions\nrelated to the 2030 Agenda. It also took up the new issue of the social and\nsolidarity economy (SSE) and its contribution to sustainable development.\nOutput on gender issues since 2016 fell due to a lack of gender capacity in-\nhouse following staff restructuring. Environmental issues are re-emerging as a\nkey area of work, especially as they relate to social policy and climate\njustice."

The title of the\nconference was **\"Overcoming Inequalities in a Fractured World: Between Elite\nPower and Social Mobilization\"**. Keynote speeches were given by Fran\u00e7ois\nBourguignon and Vandana Shiva. The conference was preceded by a roundtable\ndiscussing whether elites are the engines of inequalities, featuring Naila\nKabeer (London School of Economics), Saskia Sassen (Columbia University) and\nJomo Kwame Sundaram (Council of Eminent Persons, Malaysia).\n\nAs part of the celebrations of its 50th anniversary, UNRISD co-hosted a\nconference with the ILO (International Labour Organization) in 2013 entitled\n**\"The Potential and Limits of the Social and Solidarity Economy\"**. The\nconference featured prominent speakers such as Guy Ryder, Jose Luis Coraggio,\nPaul Singer and Sarah Cook. Over 40 academics presented research findings to\nabout 400 participants. There were several side events including a PhD poster\nsession, book presentations, a practitioners' forum, movie screenings and a\nspecial session on alternative finance and complementary currencies hosted by\nthe UN-NGLS.\n\nIn 2011, UNRISD organized a conference held in Geneva on climate change as a\nsocial development issue called **\"Green Economy and Sustainable Development:\nBringing Back the Social Dimension\"**. The conference created a forum for\ndeveloping a conceptual and policy framework to position social dimensions at\nthe centre of green economy and sustainable development. Policy reports and\nother publications prepared for this conference informed the United Nations\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) preparatory process and\nsubsequent policy discussions."
