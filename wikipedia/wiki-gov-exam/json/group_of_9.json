The alliance\nformed in 1965, when the nine countries presented a case study at the United\nNations. They co-sponsored Resolution 2129 promoting East-West cooperation in\nEurope, unanimously adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in December\n1965. The alliance became the **Group of Ten** when the Netherlands joined by\nparliamentary decision in 1967. Following the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia,\nthe group attempted to reconcile its differences at a meeting held at the\nUnited Nations in October 1969, but failed and subsequently dissolved. All\nmember states, with the exception of the dissolved Yugoslavia, are now part of\nthe European Union."
