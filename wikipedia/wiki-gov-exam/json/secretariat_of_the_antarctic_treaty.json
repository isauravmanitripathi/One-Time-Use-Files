        "generated_section_content_md": "During its first thirty years of existence, until 1991, the Antarctic Treaty\noperated based on a non-permanent secretariat, which rotated in parallel with\nthe organization of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings (ATCM). Thus,\nadministrative matters were handled by the host country of the next ATCM, at\nthe end of the previous meeting. With the adoption of the Madrid Protocol,\nwhich added a series of organizational and coordination issues, the need to\ncreate a permanent Secretariat for the Antarctic Treaty became evident.\n\nDuring ATCM XVII (Venice, 1992) a consensus was reached on the need to\nestablish a Secretariat to help the ATCM and the future Committee for\nEnvironmental Protection (CEP), created by the Madrid Protocol, to carry out\ntheir functions. At that same Meeting, Argentina proposed Buenos Aires as the\nheadquarters of the permanent Secretariat, while the United States proposed\nWashington D.C.\n\nFor several years thereafter, the ATCM debated the geographical location of\nthe future Secretariat. At ATCM XXII (Troms\u00f8, 1998) Australia proposed the\ncity of Hobart, but at ATCM XXIII (Lima, 1999) a large majority of\nConsultative Parties had expressed their support for the Argentine capital\ncity. Eventually, at ATCM XXIV (Saint Petersburg, 2001) Parties reached a\nconsensus to establish the Secretariat in Buenos Aires.\n\nThe basic guidelines and the budget forecasts for the Secretariat were drawn\nup at the XXV and XXVI ATCMs (Warsaw, 2002 and Madrid, 2003, respectively).\nThe specific functions of the Secretariat are included in Measure 1 (2003).\nThe first Executive Secretary was elected during ATCM XXVII (Cape Town, 2004)\nand the Secretariat started operating on 1 September 2004."
