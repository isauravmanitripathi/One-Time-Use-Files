Between 2020 and 2024, the University will be guided by\nthe following four overarching objectives:\n\n1. Pursue policy-relevant programming: by continuing to make policy considerations central to its research programmes and, in addition, actively shaping policy agendas through targeted and strategic collaborations.\n2. Invest in a dynamic, innovative, and diverse institutional culture: by encouraging innovation in all dimensions of the University's work, which is undertaken by a diverse and gender-balanced community of scholars, communicators, and management professionals, and by promoting collaboration across spatial and disciplinary boundaries.\n3. Strengthen collaboration, communications, and visibility: by leveraging the expertise and networks spread across the UNU system, promoting collaboration, impactful communications undertakings, and ensuring that UNU research meets actual demands.\n4. Strive for financial sustainability across UNU's architecture: by addressing the financial constraints that would otherwise undermine ambitious, long-term, research planning, and ensure through participatory management practices that fundraising objectives are realistic, achievable, and complement other strategic priorities.\n\nAs prescribed in the United Nations University Strategic Plan 2020\u20132024, the\nUN University's academic work falls within three thematic areas:\n\n* Peace and security\n* Social change and economic development\n* Environment, climate, and energy.\n\nCollectively, these thematic clusters define the programme space within which\nthe UN University undertakes its academic activities. Some key perspectives\n(such as gender equality, human rights and sustainability) pervade all aspects\nof the UN University's work."
