Third-party consultations have fed into this road\nmap, which also aimed to activate third parties, such as UN funds, specialized\nagencies, and regional organizations, to provide more support to Member\nStates. The commission furthermore engages with other regional actors to link\ntheir agendas to the SDGs. One example is the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations (ASEAN) _Community Vision 2025_. However, regional agendas outside the\nSDG framework are continually evolving, as exemplified by the new ASEAN\nRecovery Framework and ASEAN\u2019s Vision 2040.\n\nESCAP has also established novel tools to structure its support to its member\nstates and others. Examples include ESCAP\u2019s _SDG Rapid Response_ facility,\nused for individual and shared support requests, and its _SDG Helpdesk_ ,\nwhich offers a platform with tools, knowledge products, expertise, good\npractices, advice, opportunities for peer learning, and regional South-South\nCooperation. ESCAP also seeks to create interaction between debtors and\ncreditors with a focus on the small island states in the Pacific. To date,\nthis has been done through a Regional Debt Conference, rather than some more\npermanent tool."
