The Security Council\nreceived the report on 31 December 1946 and passed a resolution on 10 March\n1947, \"recognizing that any agreement expressed by the members of the Council\nto the separate portions of the report is preliminary\" and requesting a second\nreport to be made. On 4 November 1948, the General Assembly passed a\nresolution stating that it had examined the first, second and third reports of\nthe Commission and expressed its deep concern at the impasse which had been\nreached, as shown in its third report.\n\nOn 14 June 1946, the United States representative to the Commission, Bernard\nBaruch, presented the Baruch Plan, wherein the United States (at the time the\nonly state possessing atomic weapons) would destroy its atomic arsenal on the\ncondition that the U.N. imposed controls on atomic development that would not\nbe subject to United Nations Security Council veto. These controls would allow\nonly the peaceful use of atomic energy. The plan was passed by the Commission,\nbut not agreed to by the Soviet Union who abstained on the proposal in the\nSecurity Council. Debate on the plan continued into 1948, but by early 1947 it\nwas clear that agreement was unlikely.\n\nThe UN General Assembly officially disbanded UNAEC in 1952, although the\nCommission had been inactive since July 1949."
