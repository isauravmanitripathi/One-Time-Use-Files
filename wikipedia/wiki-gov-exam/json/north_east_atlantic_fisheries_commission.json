It replaced an\nearlier commission by the same name established by the North-East Atlantic\nFisheries Convention of 24 January 1959. It states that its objective is \"to\nensure the long-term conservation and optimum utilization of the fishery\nresources in its Convention Area, providing sustainable economic,\nenvironmental and social benefits.\" The area covered by the NEAFC Convention\nstretches from the southern tip of Greenland, east to the Barents Sea, and\nsouth to Portugal. However, as an exception, the Baltic Sea and the Danish\nstraits have been excluded from NEAFC jurisdiction, being managed instead\ndirectly by EU and Russia, in line with a bilateral general regional fishery\nmanagement arrangement.\n\nUnited Kingdom fishing will be regulated by the commission post Brexit."
