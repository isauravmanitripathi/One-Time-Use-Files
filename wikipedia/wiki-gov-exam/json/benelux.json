The name is a portmanteau formed from joining the\nfirst few letters of each country's name and was first used to name the\ncustoms agreement that initiated the union (signed in 1944). It is now used\nmore generally to refer to the geographic, economic, and cultural grouping of\nthe three countries.\n\nThe Benelux is an economically dynamic and densely populated region, with 5.6%\nof the European population (29.55 million residents) and 7.9% of the joint EU\nGDP (\u20ac36,000/resident) on 1.7% of the whole surface of the EU. In 2015, 37% of\nthe total number of EU cross-border workers worked in the Benelux; 35,000\nBelgian residents work in Luxembourg, while 37,000 others cross the border to\nwork in the Netherlands each day. In addition, 12,000 Dutch and close to a\nthousand Luxembourg residents work in Belgium.\n\nThe main institutions of the Union are the Committee of Ministers, the Council\nof the Union, the General Secretariat, the Interparliamentary Consultative\nCouncil and the Benelux Court of Justice while the Benelux Office for\nIntellectual Property covers the same land but is not part of the Benelux\nUnion.\n\nThe Benelux General Secretariat is located in Brussels. It is the central\nplatform of the Benelux Union cooperation. It handles the secretariat of the\nCommittee of Ministers, the Council of Benelux Union and the sundry committees\nand working parties. The General Secretariat provides day-to-day support for\nthe Benelux cooperation on the substantive, procedural, diplomatic and\nlogistical levels. The Secretary-General is Frans Weekers from the Netherlands\nand there are two deputies: Deputy Secretary-General Michel-Etienne Tilemans\nfrom Belgium and Deputy Secretary-General Jean-Claude Meyer from Luxembourg.\n\nThe presidency of the Benelux is held in turn by the three countries for a\nperiod of one year. Luxembourg holds the presidency for 2025.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the Benelux population speaks Dutch, about 20 percent\nspeaks French and one percent Luxembourgish as their native language. A small\nminority under one percent are native German speakers.[_citation needed_]"

        "generated_section_content_md": "Meeting of Benelux delegates in The Hague, 1949\n\nIn 1944, exiled representatives of the three countries signed the London\nCustoms Convention, the treaty that established the Benelux Customs Union.\nRatified in 1947, the treaty was in force from 1948 until it was superseded by\nthe Benelux Economic Union. The initial form of economic cooperation expanded\nsteadily over time, leading to the signing of the treaty establishing the\nBenelux Economic Union (_Benelux Economische Unie_ , _Union \u00c9conomique\nBenelux_) on 3 February 1958 in The Hague, which came into force on 1 November\n1960. Initially, the purpose of cooperation among the three partners was to\nput an end to customs barriers at their borders and ensure free movement of\npersons, capital, services, and goods between the three countries. This treaty\nwas the first example of international economic integration in Europe since\nthe Second World War.\n\nThe three countries therefore foreshadowed and provided the model for future\nEuropean integration, such as the European Coal and Steel Community, the\nEuropean Economic Community (EEC), and the European Community\u2013European Union\n(EC\u2013EU). The three partners also launched the Schengen process, which came\ninto operation in 1985. Benelux cooperation has been constantly adapted and\nnow goes much further than mere economic cooperation, extending to new and\ntopical policy areas connected with security, sustainable development, and the\neconomy.\n\nBelgian Prime Minister Gaston Eyskens, Dutch Prime Minister Piet de Jong, and\nLuxembourgish Prime Minister Pierre Werner during a Benelux conference in The\nHague, Netherlands, on 28 April 1968 Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers,\nLuxembourgish Prime Minister Pierre Werner, and Belgian Prime Minister\nWilfried Martens at the Ministry of General Affairs, on 10 November 1982 Dutch\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte, Luxembourgish Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker,\nand Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme in The Hague, Netherlands, on 24 May\n2011\n\nIn 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed. It\nentered into force in 1974. The court, composed of judges from the highest\ncourts of the three states, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of\ncommon legal rules. This international judicial institution is located in\nLuxembourg."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The 1958 Treaty between the Benelux countries establishing the Benelux\nEconomic Union was limited to a period of 50 years. During the following\nyears, and even more so after the creation of the European Union, the Benelux\ncooperation focused on developing other fields of activity within a constantly\nchanging international context.\n\nAt the end of the 50 years, the governments of the three Benelux countries\ndecided to renew the agreement, taking into account the new aspects of the\nBenelux-cooperation \u2013 such as security \u2013 and the new federal government\nstructure of Belgium. The original establishing treaty, set to expire in 2010,\nwas replaced by a new legal framework (called the Treaty revising the Treaty\nestablishing the Benelux Economic Union), which was signed on 17 June 2008.\n\nThe new treaty has no set time limit and the name of the _Benelux Economic\nUnion_ changed to _Benelux Union_ to reflect the broad scope on the union. The\nmain objectives of the treaty are the continuation and enlargement of the\ncooperation between the three member states within a larger European context.\nThe renewed treaty explicitly foresees the possibility that the Benelux\ncountries will cooperate with other European member states or with regional\ncooperation structures. The new Benelux cooperation focuses on three main\ntopics: internal market and economic union, sustainability, justice and\ninternal affairs. The number of structures in the renewed Treaty has been\nreduced and thus simplified."

This prevents extra administrative costs and time loss.\n3. **Economy and transport**\n* The removal of administrative barriers, such as with digital freight documents, makes cross-border transport more efficient and cost-effective for businesses.\n4. **Sustainability**\n* The Benelux countries cooperate on energy transition and the circular economy, contributing to a sustainable and future-proof region.\n\nThe Benelux Union also serves as a testing ground for European cooperation.\nInitiatives such as diploma recognition and cross-border truck inspections set\nan example for further European harmonization."

In 2018, a renewed political\ndeclaration was adopted between Benelux and North Rhine-Westphalia to give\ncooperation a further impetus.\n\nThe Benelux is particularly active in the field of intellectual property. The\nthree countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs\nOffice, both situated in The Hague. In 2005, they concluded a treaty\nestablishing the Benelux Office for Intellectual Property, which replaced both\noffices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006. This organisation is\nthe official body for the registration of trademarks and designs in the\nBenelux. In addition, it offers the possibility to formally record the\nexistence of ideas, concepts, designs, prototypes and the like.\n\nSome examples of recent Benelux initiatives include: automatic level\nrecognition of diplomas and degrees within the Benelux for bachelor's and\nmaster's programs in 2015, and for all other degrees in 2018; common road\ninspections in 2014; and a Benelux pilot with digital consignment notes\n(e-CMR) in 2017;[_citation needed_] a new Benelux Treaty on Police Cooperation\nin 2018, providing for direct access to each other's police databases and\npopulation registers within the limits of national legislation, and allowing\nsome police forces to cross borders in some situations. The Benelux is also\ncommitted to working together on adaptation to climate change. A joint\npolitical declaration in July 2020 called on the European Commission to\nprioritise cycling in European climate policy and Sustainable Transport\nstrategies, to co-finance the construction of cycling infrastructure, and to\nprovide funds to stimulate cycling policy.\n\nOn 5 June 2018, the Benelux Treaty celebrated its 60 years of existence. In\n2018, a Benelux Youth Parliament was created.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn addition to cooperation based on a Treaty, there is also political\ncooperation in the Benelux context, including summits of the Benelux\ngovernment leaders. In 2019 a Benelux summit was held in Luxembourg. In 2020,\na Benelux summit was held \u2013 online, due to the COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 under Dutch\nPresidency on 7 October between the prime ministers.\n\nAs of 1 January 2017, a new arrangement for NATO Air Policing started for the\nairspace of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxemburg (Benelux). The Belgian Air\nComponent and the Royal Netherlands Air Force will take four-month turns to\nensure that Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) fighter jets are available at all times\nto be launched under NATO control."

Beside these five\ninstitutions, the Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property is also an\nindependent organisation.\n\n**Benelux Committee of Ministers:** The Committee of Ministers is the supreme\ndecision-making body of the Benelux. It includes at least one representative\nat ministerial level from the three countries. Its composition varies\naccording to its agenda. The ministers determine the orientations and\npriorities of Benelux cooperation. The presidency of the Committee rotates\nbetween the three countries on an annual basis.\n\n**Benelux Council:** The council is composed of senior officials from the\nrelevant ministries. Its composition varies according to its agenda. The\ncouncil's main task is to prepare the dossiers for the ministers.\n\n**Benelux InterParliamentary Consultative Council:** The Benelux Parliament\n(officially referred to as an \"Interparliamentary Consultative Council\") was\ncreated in 1955. This parliamentary assembly is composed of 49 members from\nthe respective national parliaments (21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21\nmembers of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the\nLuxembourg parliament). Its members inform and advise their respective\ngovernments on all Benelux matters. On 20 January 2015, the governments of the\nthree countries, including, as far as Belgium is concerned, the community and\nregional governments, signed in Brussels the Treaty of the Benelux\nInterparliamentary Assembly. This treaty entered into force on 1 August 2019.\nThis superseded the 1955 Convention on the Consultative Interparliamentary\nCouncil for the Benelux. The official name has been largely obsolete in daily\npractice for a number of years: both internally in the Benelux and in external\nreferences, the name Benelux Parliament has been used _de facto_ for a number\nof years now.[_citation needed_]\n\n**Benelux Court of Justice:** The Benelux Court of Justice is an international\ncourt. Its mission is to promote uniformity in the application of Benelux\nlegislation. When faced with difficulty interpreting a common Benelux legal\nrule, national courts must seek an interpretive ruling from the Benelux Court,\nwhich subsequently renders a binding decision[_citation needed_]. The members\nof the Court are appointed from among the judges of the 'Cour de cassation' of\nBelgium, the 'Hoge Raad of the Netherlands' and the 'Cour de cassation' of\nLuxembourg[_citation needed_].\n\n**Benelux General Secretariat:** The General Secretariat, which is based in\nBrussels, forms the cooperation platform of the Benelux Union. It acts as the\nsecretariat of the Committee of Ministers, the council and various commissions\nand working groups[_citation needed_]. The General Secretariat has years of\nexpertise in the area of Benelux cooperation and is familiar with the policy\nagreements and differences between the three countries. Building on what\nalready been achieved, the General Secretariat puts its knowledge, network and\nexperience at the service of partners and stakeholders who endorse its\nmission. It initiates, supports and monitors cooperation results in the areas\nof economy, sustainability and security.\n\nThe Secretary General of the Benelux is Frans Weekers (NL), the Deputy\nSecretary General is Michel-Etienne Tilemans (BE) and Jean-Claude Meyer (LU)\n\nBenelux works together on the basis of an annual plan embedded in a four-year\njoint work programme."

However, they have no direct effect\ntowards individual citizens or companies (notwithstanding any indirect\nprotection of their rights based on such decisions as a source of\ninternational law). Only national provisions implementing a decision can\ndirectly create rights and obligations for citizens or companies.\n\n2\\. **Agreements**\n\nThe Committee of Ministers can draw up agreements, which are then submitted to\nthe Benelux states (and/or their sub-state entities) for signature and\nsubsequent parliamentary ratification. These agreements can deal with any\nsubject matter, also in policy areas that are not yet covered by cooperation\nin the framework of the Benelux Union.\n\nThese are in fact traditional treaties, with the same direct legally binding\nforce towards both authorities and citizens or companies. The negotiations do\nhowever take place in the established context of the Benelux working groups\nand institutions, rather than on an ad hoc basis.\n\n3\\. **Recommendations**\n\nRecommendations are non-binding orientations, adopted at ministerial level,\nwhich underpin the functioning of the Benelux Union. These (policy)\norientations may not be legally binding, but given their adoption at the\nhighest political level and their legal basis vested directly in the Treaty,\nthey do entail a strong moral obligation for any authority concerned in the\nBenelux countries.\n\n4\\. **Directives**\n\nDirectives of the Committee of Ministers are mere inter-institutional\ninstructions towards the Benelux Council and/or the Secretariat-General, for\nwhich they are binding. This instrument has so far only been used\noccasionally, basically in order to organize certain activities within a\nBenelux working group or to give them impetus.\n\nAll four instruments require the unanimous approval of the members of the\nCommittee of Ministers (and, in the case of agreements, subsequent signature\nand ratification at national level)."
