EUMETSAT is responsible for\nthe launch and operation of the satellites and for delivering satellite data\nto end-users as well as contributing to the operational monitoring of climate\nand the detection of global climate changes.\n\nThe activities of EUMETSAT contribute to a global meteorological satellite\nobserving system coordinated with other space-faring states.\n\nSatellite observations are an essential input to numerical weather prediction\nsystems and also assist the human forecaster in the diagnosis of potentially\nhazardous weather developments. Of growing importance is the capacity of\nweather satellites to gather long-term measurements from space in support of\nclimate change studies.\n\nEUMETSAT is not an institution or agency of the European Union, although the\nmajority of its members are EU member states. The organisation became a\nsignatory to the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters in 2012,\nthus providing for the global charitable use of its space assets."

The first,\nMetop-A, was launched by a Russian Soyuz-2.1a rocket from Baikonur on October\n19, 2006, at 22:28 Baikonur time (16:28 UTC). Metop-A was initially controlled\nby ESOC for the LEOP phase immediately following launch, with control handed\nover to EUMETSAT 72 hours after lift-off. EUMETSAT's first commands to the\nsatellite were sent at 14:04 UTC on October 22, 2006.\n\nThe second EPS satellite, Metop-B, was launched from Baikonur on 17 September\n2012, and the third, Metop-C, was launched from Centre Spatial Guyanais in\nKourou, French Guiana on 7 November 2018 by Arianespace using a Soyuz ST-B\nlaunch vehicle with a Fregat-M upper stage.\n\nPositioned at approximately 817 km (508 mi) above the Earth, special\ninstruments on board Metop-A can deliver far more precise details about\natmospheric temperature and moisture profiles than a geostationary satellite.\n\nThe satellites also ensure that the more remote regions of the globe,\nparticularly in Northern Europe as well as the oceans in the Southern\nhemisphere, are fully covered.\n\nThe EPS programme is also the European half of a joint program with NOAA,\ncalled the International Joint Polar System (IJPS). NOAA has operated a\ncontinuous series of low earth orbiting meteorological satellite since April\n1960. Many of the instruments on Metop are also operated on NOAA/POES\nsatellites, providing similar data types across the IJPS."

EUMETSAT \u2013 What We Do \u2013 Jason-2 \u2013\nLaunch Description\n\nJason-2 reliably delivers detailed oceanographic data vital to our\nunderstanding of weather forecasting and climate change monitoring. Jason-2\nprovides data on the decadal (10-yearly) oscillations in large ocean basins,\nsuch as the Atlantic Ocean; mesoscale variability, and surface wind and wave\nconditions. Jason-2 measurements contribute to the European Centre for Medium-\nRange Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) satellite data assimilation, helping improve\nglobal atmosphere and ocean forecasting.\n\nAltimetric data from Jason-2 have also helped create detailed decade-long\nglobal observations and analyses of the El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a phenomena, opening\nthe way to new discoveries about ocean circulation and its effects on climate,\nand providing new insights into ocean tides, turbulent ocean eddies and marine\ngravity.\n\nJason-3\n\nJason-3 was Launched on 17 January 2016, Vandenberg Air Force Base in\nCalifornia, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 launcher. It is operational since 14 October\n2016. Jason-3 is on a non-Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit at 66\u00b0 inclination\nand 1336 km altitude, optimised to eliminate tidal aliasing from sea surface\nheight and mean sea level measurements. Jason-2, flies on the same orbit but\nat 162\u00b0. It is built on the same cooperation as Jason-2, involving EUMETSAT,\nNOAA, CNES and NASA, with Copernicus expected to support the European\ncontribution to operations, as part of its HPOA activity, which also covers\ncontributions to the Jason-CS programme.\n\nSentinel-6/Jason-CS\n\nThe Jason satellites were succeeded by the Sentinel-6 for the radar altimeter\nmission, part of the European Union's Copernicus Programme for Earth\nobservation, with the objective of providing an operational service for high-\nprecision measurements of global sea-level. This mission is implemented as a\nmulti-partner cooperation between the European Commission and EUMETSAT, ESA,\nNOAA and NASA, with support from the French space agency, CNES.\n\nThe mission, implemented through the two Sentinel-6/Jason-CS satellites\n(Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich and Sentinel-6B), aims to continue high precision\nocean altimetry measurements in the 2020\u20132030 time-frame. A secondary\nobjective is to collect high resolution vertical profiles of temperature,\nusing the GNSS Radio-Occultation sounding technique, to assess temperature\nchanges in the troposphere and stratosphere and to support Numerical Weather\nPrediction.\n\nThe launch of the first satellite \u2013 Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich \u2013 occurred\nsuccessfully on 21 November 2020 from Vandenberg AFB in California, USA on a\nSpaceX Falcon-9 launch vehicle. The satellite was named in honour of Michael\nFreilich (oceanographer), an oceanographer and former director of NASA's Earth\nScience Division. Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich succeeded Jason-3 as the\nreference mission for satellite ocean altimetry in April 2022.\n\nThe launch of Sentinel-6B is foreseen for late-2025, also on a SpaceX\nFalcon-9."
