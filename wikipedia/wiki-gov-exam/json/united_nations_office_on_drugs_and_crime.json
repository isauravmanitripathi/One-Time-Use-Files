Approximately 90% of the Office's funding comes from\nvoluntary contributions, mainly from governments.\n\nThese are the main themes that UNODC deals with: alternative development,\nanti-corruption, criminal justice, prison reform and crime prevention, drug\nprevention, treatment and care, HIV and AIDS, human trafficking and migrant\nsmuggling, money laundering, organized crime, piracy, terrorism prevention."

The\ntext of the convention was negotiated during seven sessions held between 21\nJanuary 2002 and 1 October 2003. The convention was adopted by the General\nAssembly on 31 October 2003. In 2003, the United Nations adopted the UN\nConvention against Corruption (UNCAC). The Convention came into force in\nDecember 2005. As of 9 November 2012,[update] 140 countries had signed and 164\ncountries (States Parties) had ratified the UNCAC. UNODC serves as the\nSecretariat for the Conference of the States Parties (CoSP) to the UNCAC.\n\nUNCAC is a legally binding instrument (perhaps the only anti-corruption\nlegally binding global instrument). A highlight of UNCAC is the inclusion of a\nspecific chapter on asset recovery which aimed at returning assets to their\nrightful owners including countries from which they had been taken illicitly.\n\nUNODC, as the custodian of UNCAC, is also one of the main initiators of the\nestablishment of the International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA), whose main\nfunction is to, among other things, facilitate more effective implementation\nof the UNCAC."

An important purpose of the first two treaties is to codify\ninternationally applicable control measures in order to ensure the\navailability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and\nscientific purposes, and to prevent their diversion into illicit channels.\nThey also include general provisions on trafficking and drug abuse."
