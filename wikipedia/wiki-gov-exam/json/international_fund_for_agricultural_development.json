It is the only multilateral development organization that focuses\nsolely on rural economies and food security.\n\nIFAD is involved in over 200 projects across nearly 100 countries. It funds\nand sponsors initiatives that improve land and water management, develop rural\ninfrastructure, train and educate farmers in more efficient technologies,\nbuild up resilience against climate change, enhancing market accessibility,\nand more.\n\nIFAD has 180 member states with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting\nCountries (OPEC) and members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and\nDevelopment (OECD).

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the early 1970s, global food shortages led to widespread famine,\nmalnutrition, and mortality, particularly affecting the Sahel region of\nAfrica. The world required long-term, coordinated approaches to the structural\nissues that were causing destitution and food shortages. IFAD was established\nas an international financial institution in 1977 through United Nations\nGeneral Assembly Resolution 32/107 (15 December 1977) as one of the major\noutcomes of the 1974 World Food Conference. The conference highlighted the\nvital importance of addressing food insecurity and poverty in emerging\ncountries' rural communities. IFAD officially opened its headquarters in Rome,\nItaly and convened its first governing council with 120 member states and it\nis a member of the United Nations Development Group."

The\nlegacy of neo-liberal policies pushed for by international development\nagencies has often drawn criticism, and although IFAD specifically targets\nsmall-scale actors, prevalent debates about agriculture and aid effectiveness\nextend to the role played by institutions such as IFAD. Many scholars oppose\nthe status quo and call for a change in the approach to food insecurity as\nillustrated with the quote \u201cThe global food system, driven by neoliberal\neconomic policies, has transformed agriculture into an instrument for economic\ndevelopment, often at the expense of local communities' food security and\nautonomy\u201d."

IFAD has targeted\nfinancialization as a way of supporting food production and allowing markets\nto deliver solutions. As such, some scholars have been vocal in their\ncriticism of financialization and its shortcomings, by exacerbating\ninequalities (concentrating wealth among financial elites and agribusiness\ncorporations), heightening the fragility of the food system to shocks\n(economic and environmental), stifling collective action to build ecologically\nsound food systems, and leaving small-scale farmers more exposed to price\nvolatility due to contracted loans and financial derivatives. Moreover, many\nhave pointed to the commodification and trade of agricultural assets as a\nreason for rising food prices around the world."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 2009, a report published by Rutsel Martha (general counsel of legal affairs\nat IFAD) titled _Mandate issues in the activities of the International Fund\nfor Agricultural Development (IFAD)_ looked at the issues regarding the\ninstitutions interpretations of its law's: \"Every action of an international\norganization, including IFAD, expresses or implies some interpretation of the\norganization\u2019s law, in particular its constituent instrument. In other words,\nIFAD\u2019s actions, like those of other international organizations, imply a view\nabout the meaning of its law, and are therefore quintessentially\ninterpretative of the legal regulations that govern its existence and\noperations\". In this sense, multiple occasions have revealed how IFAD relies\non interpretations and auxiliary instruments to address its mission of\nalleviating food insecurity. For example, it bypassed the original prerogative\nstating \"the Fund can only finance its developing Member States and\nintergovernmental organizations in which those States participate\" to extend\nfinancing to NGO's under certain conditions.\n\nIn the late 1990's and early 2000's, IFAD again bypassed its original mandate\nvia legal instruments to deliver programs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,\nunder accords with the Palestinian authority which was not a recognized member\nstate. The chairman of the 21st session of the governing council in his\nclosing statement stated: \"\u201cThe long arms of hunger and poverty know no legal\nor political boundaries, yet development aid very often faces constraints that\nlimit its outreach. During this Session we have overcome just such a\nconstraint by establishing a Fund for Gaza and the West Bank, a territory that\nis not a Member State of IFAD. There is indeed satisfaction in overcoming\nbounds and in reaching out to PEOPLE not to boundaries\u201d. In response to this,\nthe United States representative stated that although \u201cthe United States\nsupports international efforts to assist the Palestinian people, not only to\nimprove day-to-day lives, but also to build a constituency for peace\", because\nof \"US legal restrictions, our contributions and assistance cannot be used for\nthe proposed IFAD special fund\". This situation revealed how IFAD is subject\nto judicial and political challenges, which can undermine its mission. Rustel\nMartha wrote of the incident that it highlighted \"the fact that when\norganizations embark on activities which cannot be clearly identified as\nhaving been authorized by the constituent instrument, it may place membership\ncontribution at risk\"."
