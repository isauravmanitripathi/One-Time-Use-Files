In 1992, it became\nthe **Centre for Disarmament Affairs** , working under the Department of\nPolitical Affairs. At the end of 1997, it reverted to being the **Department\nfor Disarmament Affairs**. Then, in 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nannounced the appointment of S\u00e9rgio de Queiroz Duarte of Brazil as the High\nRepresentative for Disarmament Affairs at the Under-Secretary-General (USG)\nlevel and the department became the United Nations Office for Disarmament\nAffairs. Following the retirement of S\u00e9rgio Duarte in February 2012, Angela\nKane, then USG for Management, was appointed as the new High Representative\nfor Disarmament Affairs. She was the first woman and first non diplomat\nappointed to this position."
