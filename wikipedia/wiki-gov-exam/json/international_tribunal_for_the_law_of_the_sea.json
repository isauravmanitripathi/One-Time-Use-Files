It was established by the United\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay, Jamaica, on\nDecember 10, 1982. The Convention entered into force on November 16, 1994, and\nestablished an international framework for law over all ocean space, its uses\nand resources. The ITLOS is one of four dispute resolution mechanisms listed\nin Article 287 of the UNCLOS. Although the Tribunal was established by a\nUnited Nations convention, it is not, as such, a United Nations agency. Even\nso, it maintains close links with the United Nations and in 1997 the Tribunal\nconcluded an Agreement on Cooperation and Relationship between the United\nNations and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which\nestablishes a mechanism for cooperation between the two institutions.\n\nThe Tribunal is based in Hamburg, Germany. The Convention also established the\nInternational Seabed Authority, with responsibility for the regulation of\nseabed mining beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, that is beyond the\nlimits of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone and the continental shelf.\nAs of July 2024, there are currently 157 signatories, 169 participant states\nplus the European Union. As of December 2022[update], holdouts included the\nUnited States and Iran."
