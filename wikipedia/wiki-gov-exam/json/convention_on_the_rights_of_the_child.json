The convention defines a child as any\nhuman being under the age of eighteen, unless the age of majority is attained\nearlier under national legislation.\n\nNations that have ratified this convention or have acceded to it are bound by\ninternational law. When a state has signed the treaty but not ratified it, it\nis not yet bound by the treaty's provisions but is already obliged to not act\ncontrary to its purpose.\n\nThe UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, composed of eighteen independent\nexperts, is responsible for supervising the implementation of the convention\nby the states that have ratified it. Their governments are required to report\nto and appear before the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child periodically\nto be examined on their progress regarding the advancement of the\nimplementation of the convention and the status of child rights in their\ncountry. Their reports and the committee's written views and concerns are\navailable on the committee's website.\n\nIndividuals can appeal to the Committee on the Rights of the Child if they\nbelieve that rights, according to the convention, have been violated. The\nthird possibility for monitoring the implementation of the convention is\ninquiries that the Committee on the Rights of the Child can carry out on their\nown initiative if they have reliable information that leads them to believe\nthat a member state has violated the convention's rights. However, \"states ...\nmay opt-out from the inquiry procedure, at the time of signature or\nratification or accession\". Once a year, the committee submits a report to the\nThird Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which also hears a\nstatement from the CRC Chair, and the Assembly adopts a Resolution on the\nRights of the Child.\n\nThe UN General Assembly adopted the convention and opened it for signature on\n20 November 1989 (the 30th anniversary of its Declaration of the Rights of the\nChild). It came into force on 2 September 1990, after it was ratified by the\nrequired number of nations. As of 12 August 2025, 196 countries are party to\nit, including every member of the United Nations except the United States.\n\nTwo optional protocols were adopted on 25 May 2000. The First Optional\nProtocol restricts the involvement of children in military conflicts, and the\nSecond Optional Protocol prohibits the sale of children, child prostitution\nand child pornography. More than 170 states have ratified both protocols. A\nthird optional protocol relating to communication of complaints was adopted in\nDecember 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February 2012. It came into\neffect on 14 April 2014."

It requires that\nthe \"nations that ratify this convention are bound to it by international\nlaw.\" Ratifying states must act in the best interests of the child.\n\nIn all jurisdictions implementing the convention requires compliance with\nchild custody and guardianship laws as every child has basic rights, including\nthe right to life, to their own name and identity, to be raised by their\nparents within a family or cultural grouping, and to have a relationship with\nboth parents, even if they are separated.\n\nThe convention obliges states to allow parents to exercise their parental\nresponsibilities. The convention also acknowledges that children have the\nright to express their opinions and to have those opinions heard and acted\nupon when appropriate, to be protected from abuse or exploitation, and to have\ntheir privacy protected. It requires that their lives not be subject to\nexcessive interference.\n\nThe convention also obliges signatory states to separate legal representation\nfor a child in any judicial dispute concerning their care and asks that the\nchild's viewpoint be heard in such cases.\n\nThe convention forbids capital punishment for children. In its General Comment\n8 (2006) the committee stated that there was an \"obligation of all state\nparties to move quickly to prohibit and eliminate all corporal punishment and\nall other cruel or degrading forms of punishment of children\". Article 19 of\nthe convention states that state parties must \"take all appropriate\nlegislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the\nchild from all forms of physical or mental violence\", but it makes no\nreference to corporal punishment. The committee's interpretation of this\nsection to encompass a prohibition on corporal punishment has been rejected by\nseveral state parties to the convention, including Australia, Canada and the\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights has referred to the convention when\ninterpreting the European Convention on Human Rights."

In terms of the\nratification of the convention, a significant number of laws, decrees and\nresolutions were approved in Azerbaijan by the President and the Cabinet of\nMinisters focusing on the development of the child welfare system. In this\nregard, the Convention No. 182 of the International Labour Organization, i.e.\nthe Convention on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour, the\nRecommendation No. 190 of the International Labour Organization and the Hague\nAdoption Convention were ratified by Milli Majlis, the parliament of\nAzerbaijan, in 2004.\n\nThere is a concern over the administration of juvenile justice in Azerbaijan,\nmostly regarding compliance with articles 37, 39, and 40 of the convention, as\nwell as other relevant standards such as the Beijing Rules, the Riyadh\nGuidelines, and the United Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles\nDeprived of their Liberty. Therefore, international organizations assisted\nAzerbaijan to improve the situation in the field of juvenile justice. Juvenile\noffenders have been added to the Presidential pardons on a regular basis.\n\nAzerbaijan has built cooperation with many international organizations,\nparticularly with UNICEF in child protection. In 1993, UNICEF began its\nactivity in Azerbaijan. In 2005, Azerbaijan and UNICEF signed a five-year\ncountry program. The country program for 2005-2009 was implemented in child\nprotection, children's health and nutrition, children's education and youth\nhealth, and their development and participation. Also, UNICEF supports\nAzerbaijan in improving its juvenile justice system, establishing an\nalternative care system and raising awareness among youth about HIV/AIDS."

As required under the UNCRC, Bangladesh\nenacted the Children Act, 2013 (amended 2018), replacing the Children Act 1974\nto provide comprehensive legal protection for children. The Act was explicitly\ndrafted with regard to UNCRC principles, including juvenile justice, custody,\nand child welfare, though implementation gaps remain. Bangladesh ratified ILO\nConvention No 182 on the worst forms of child labour and later ratified\nMinimum Age Convention No 138 in March 2022.\n\nDespite legal frameworks, juvenile justice remains problematic where the\nminimum age of criminal responsibility is still nine years, below the UNCRC-\nrecommended 12 years. Child Development Centres (JDCs) established under the\nChildren Act are few, overcrowded, and frequently accused of torture and\ninhumane treatment. Although every district is meant to have a separate\nChildren\u2019s Court, most areas still rely on overburdened Women and Children\nTribunals with no dedicated courtrooms.\n\nIn response, Bangladesh partnered with UNICEF to develop a national child\nprotection system aligned with UNCRC standards through its Child-Friendly\nJustice initiative. On 24 March 2025, UNICEF welcomed government plans to\nestablish separate Children\u2019s Courts nationwide as part of implementing the\nChildren Act and aligning with international norms. Civil society and\ninternational monitors continue to call for stronger enforcement and resources\nto fully realize child protection commitments."

Concerns raised by the committee\nincluded the growth in child poverty and inequality, the extent of violence\ntowards children, the use of custody for young offenders, the low age of\ncriminal responsibility, and the lack of opportunities for children and young\npeople to express views. The 2002 report of the committee expressed similar\nconcerns, including the welfare of children in custody, unequal treatment of\nasylum seekers, and the negative impact of poverty on children's rights. In\nSeptember 2008, the UK government decided to withdraw its reservations and\nagree to the convention in these respects.\n\nAlthough child slavery is difficult to gauge within the UK, child slaves are\nimported into the UK and sold. Laws and enforcement mechanisms against slavery\nand human trafficking were consolidated and strengthened in the Modern Slavery\nAct 2015."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The United States government played an active role in the drafting of the\nconvention and signed it on 16 February 1995, but has not ratified it. It has\nbeen claimed that American opposition to the convention stems primarily from\npolitical and religious conservatives. For example, The Heritage Foundation\nconsiders that \"a civil society in which moral authority is exercised by\nreligious congregations, family, and other private associations is fundamental\nto the American order,\" and the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA)\nargues that the CRC threatens homeschooling. Other Christian right\norganizations such as Concerned Women for America have argued that the CRC is\nan effort by globalists to remove children from their religious and family\ncontexts; Christian right figures such as John Whitehead state that it will\nlimit parental rights.\n\nMost notably, at the time several states permitted the execution and life\nimprisonment of juvenile offenders, a direct contravention of Article 37 of\nthe convention. The landmark 2005 Supreme Court decision in _Roper v. Simmons_\ndeclared juvenile executions to be unconstitutional as \"cruel and unusual\npunishment\"; in the 2012 case _Miller v. Alabama_ , the court held that\nmandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole are\nunconstitutional for juvenile offenders. However, the Court issued a ruling in\n_Jones v. Mississippi_ that Miller does not require States to make an\nindependent finding of \"permanent incorrigibility\" before sentencing the\njuvenile to life imprisonment without parole.\n\nState laws regarding the practice of closed adoption may also require an\noverhaul in light of the Convention's position that children have a right to\nidentity from birth.\n\nDuring his 2008 campaign for president, Senator Barack Obama described the\nfailure to ratify the convention as \"embarrassing\" and promised to review the\nissue but, as president, he never did. No president of the United States has\nsubmitted the treaty to the Senate requesting its advice and consent to\nratification since the US signed it in 1995.\n\nThe United States has ratified two of the optional protocols to the\nconvention: the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed\nConflict, and the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child\nProstitution and Child Pornography."

        "section_name": "Optional protocols",
        "generated_section_content_md": "There are three optional protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the\nChild. The first, the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in\nArmed Conflict requires parties to ensure that children under the age of 18\nare not recruited compulsorily into their armed forces and calls on\ngovernments to do everything feasible to ensure that members of their armed\nforces who are under 18 years do not take part in hostilities. This protocol\nentered into force on 12 July 2002. As of 12 August 2025, 172 states are party\nto the protocol, and another 8 states have signed but not ratified it.\n\nThe second, the Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution\nand Child Pornography, requires parties to prohibit the sale of children,\nchild prostitution and child pornography. It entered into force on 18 January\n2002. As of 12 August 2025, 178 states are party to the protocol, and another\n7 states have signed but not ratified it.\n\nA third, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on\na Communications Procedure, which would allow children or their\nrepresentatives to file individual complaints for violation of the rights of\nchildren, was adopted in December 2011 and opened for signature on 28 February\n2012. The protocol currently has 52 signatures and 50 ratifications: it\nentered into force on 14 April 2014 following the tenth ratification three\nmonths beforehand.\n\nProposals for additional optional protocols have also been made. In 2020, the\nindependent \"Lancet-WHO-UNICEF Commission\" proposed the development of an\noptional protocol to protect children from the marketing of tobacco, alcohol,\nformula milk, sugar-sweetened beverages, gambling, and potentially damaging\nsocial media, and the inappropriate use of their personal data. (The WHO also\nhas its own framework for making treaties.) In 2022, a group of international\nchild rights and education experts joined a call for an update to the right to\neducation under international law to explicitly guarantee children's right to\nfree pre-primary and free secondary education. Human Rights Watch has\nsuggested doing so through a fourth optional protocol to the CRC. In June\n2024, the UN's Human Rights Council approved the establishment of a working\ngroup with the mandate of \"exploring the possibility of, elaborating and\nsubmitting to the Human Rights Council a draft optional protocol to the\nConvention on the Rights of the Child with the aim to: (a) Explicitly\nrecognize that the right to education includes early childhood care and\neducation; (b) Explicitly state that, with a view to achieving the right to\neducation, States shall: (i) Make public pre-primary education available free\nto all, beginning with at least one year; (ii) Make public secondary education\navailable free to all.\""

The Russian delegate, Kristina Sukacheva, remarked that\ngovernments voting against parents deliberately shirk their international\nresponsibilities to provide for the rights of the child. At the time of\nadoption, Uruguay stated that the incorporation of parental rights language as\nproposed by the Russian Federation would \"bring imbalance to the resolution\nand would also go against the spirit of the resolution\"."
