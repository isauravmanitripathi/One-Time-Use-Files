With the incorporation of India on 19 January\n2018, it now has 43 members, including Australia, New Zealand, the European\nCommission, all 27 member states of the European Union, United Kingdom, the\nUnited States, Canada, India, Ukraine, and Argentina. The name comes from\nAustralia's initiative to create the group. Australia manages the secretariat.\n\nThe initial members of the group had different assessments of which chemical\nprecursors should be subject to export control. Later adherents initially had\nno such controls. Today, members of the group maintain export controls on a\nuniform list of 90 compounds, including several that are not prohibited for\nexport under the Chemical Weapons Convention, but can be used in the\nmanufacture of chemical weapons. Additionally, the Australia Group expanded\nits standardization of licensing and export controls to cover technology\nrelated to the manufacturing of chemical weapons or controlled components.\n\nIn 2002, the group took two important steps to strengthen export control. The\nfirst was the \"no-undercut\" requirement, which stated that any member of the\ngroup considering making an export to another state that had already been\ndenied an export by any other member of the group must first consult with that\nmember state before approving the export. The second was the \"catch-all\"\nprovision, which requires member states to halt all exports that could be used\nby importers in chemical or biological weapons programs, regardless of whether\nthe export is on the group's control lists. Delegations representing the\nmembers meet every year in Paris, France."
