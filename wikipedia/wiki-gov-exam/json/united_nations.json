The winners of the war,\nthe Allies, met to decide on formal peace terms at the Paris Peace Conference.\nThe League of Nations was approved and started operations, but the United\nStates never joined. On 10 January 1920, the League of Nations formally came\ninto being when the Covenant of the League of Nations, ratified by 42 nations\nin 1919, took effect. The League Council acted as an executive body directing\nthe Assembly's business. It began with four permanent members\u2014the United\nKingdom, France, Italy, and Japan.\n\nAfter some limited successes and failures during the 1920s, the League proved\nineffective in the 1930s, as it failed to act against the Japanese invasion of\nManchuria in 1933. Forty nations voted for Japan to withdraw from Manchuria\nbut Japan voted against it and walked out of the League instead of withdrawing\nfrom Manchuria. It also failed to act against the Second Italo-Ethiopian War,\nafter the appeal for international intervention by Ethiopian Emperor Haile\nSelassie I at Geneva in 1936 went with no avail, including when calls for\neconomic sanctions against Italy failed. Italy and other nations left the\nLeague.\n\nWhen World War II broke out in 1939, the League effectively closed down."

        "generated_section_content_md": "1943 sketch by Franklin Roosevelt of the UN original three branches: The Four\nPolicemen, an executive branch, and an international assembly of forty UN\nmember states.\n\nThe first step towards the establishment of the United Nations was the Inter-\nAllied Conference in London that led to the Declaration of St James's Palace\non 12 June 1941. By August 1941, American President Franklin Roosevelt and\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill had drafted the Atlantic Charter;\nwhich defined goals for the post-war world. At the subsequent meeting of the\nInter-Allied Council in London on 24 September 1941, the eight governments in\nexile of countries under Axis occupation, together with the Soviet Union and\nrepresentatives of the Free French Forces, unanimously adopted adherence to\nthe common principles of policy set forth by Britain and the United States.\n\nRoosevelt and Churchill met at the White House in December 1941 for the\nArcadia Conference. Roosevelt is considered a founder of the UN, and coined\nthe term _United Nations_ to describe the Allied countries. Churchill accepted\nit, noting its use by Lord Byron. The text of the Declaration by United\nNations was drafted on 29 December 1941, by Roosevelt, Churchill, and Harry\nHopkins. It incorporated Soviet suggestions but included no role for France.\nOne major change from the Atlantic Charter was the addition of a provision for\nreligious freedom, which Stalin approved after Roosevelt insisted.\n\nRoosevelt's idea of the \"Four Powers\", refers to the four major Allied\ncountries, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and China,\nemerged in the Declaration by the United Nations. On New Year's Day 1942,\nRoosevelt, Churchill, the Soviet Union's former Foreign Minister Maxim\nLitvinov, and the Chinese Premier T. V. Soong signed the \"Declaration by\nUnited Nations\", and the next day the representatives of twenty-two other\nnations added their signatures. During the war, the United Nations became the\nofficial term for the Allies. In order to join, countries had to sign the\nDeclaration and declare war on the Axis powers.\n\nThe October 1943 Moscow Conference resulted in the Moscow Declarations,\nincluding the Four Power Declaration on General Security. This declaration was\nsigned by the Allied Big Four\u2014the United States, the Soviet Union, the United\nKingdom, and China\u2014and aimed for the creation \"at the earliest possible date\nof a general international organization\". This was the first public\nannouncement that a new international organization was being contemplated to\nreplace the League of Nations. The Tehran Conference followed shortly\nafterwards at which Roosevelt, Churchill and Joseph Stalin, the leader of the\nSoviet Union, met and discussed the idea of a post-war international\norganization.\n\nThe new international organization was formulated and negotiated amongst the\ndelegations from the Allied Big Four at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference from 21\nSeptember to 7 October 1944. They agreed on proposals for the aims, structure\nand functioning of the new organization. It took the conference at Yalta in\nFebruary 1945, and further negotiations with the Soviet Union, before all the\nissues were resolved."

After months of planning, the UN Conference on International\nOrganization opened in San Francisco on 25 April 1945. It was attended by 50\nnations' governments and a number of non-governmental organizations. The\ndelegations of the Big Four chaired the plenary meetings. Previously,\nChurchill had urged Roosevelt to restore France to its status of a major power\nafter the liberation of Paris in August 1944. The drafting of the Charter of\nthe United Nations was completed over the following two months, and it was\nsigned on 26 June 1945 by the representatives of the 50 countries. The UN\nofficially came into existence on 24 October 1945, upon ratification of the\nCharter by the five permanent members of the Security Council: the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union and China \u2014 and by a\nmajority of the other 46 nations.\n\nThe first meetings of the General Assembly, with 51 nations represented, and\nthe Security Council took place in London beginning in January 1946. Debates\nbegan at once, covering topical issues such as the presence of Russian troops\nin Iranian Azerbaijan and British forces in Greece. British diplomat Gladwyn\nJebb served as interim secretary-general.\n\nThe General Assembly selected New York City as the site for the headquarters\nof the UN. Construction began on 14 September 1948 and the facility was\ncompleted on 9 October 1952. The Norwegian Foreign Minister, Trygve Lie, was\nthe first elected UN secretary-general."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld was a particularly active secretary-general from 1953 until\nhe died in 1961.\n\nThough the UN's primary mandate was peacekeeping, the division between the\nUnited States and the Soviet Union often paralysed the organization; generally\nallowing it to intervene only in conflicts distant from the Cold War. Two\nnotable exceptions were a Security Council resolution on 7 July 1950\nauthorizing a US-led coalition to repel the North Korean invasion of South\nKorea, passed in the absence of the Soviet Union, and the signing of the\nKorean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953.\n\nOn 29 November 1947, the General Assembly approved resolution 181, a proposal\nto partition Palestine into two states, with Jerusalem placed under a special\ninternational regime. The plan failed and a civil war broke out in Palestine,\nthat led to the creation of the state of Israel afterward. Two years later,\nRalph Bunche, a UN official, negotiated an armistice to the resulting\nconflict, with the Security Council deciding that \"an armistice shall be\nestablished in all sectors of Palestine\". On 7 November 1956, the first UN\npeacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis; however, the UN was\nunable to intervene against the Soviet Union's simultaneous invasion of\nHungary, following the country's revolution.\n\nOn 14 July 1960, the UN established the United Nations Operation in the Congo\n(or UNOC), the largest military force of its early decades, to bring order to\nKatanga, restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of the Congo\nby 11 May 1964. While travelling to meet rebel leader Moise Tshombe during the\nconflict, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, often named as one of the UN's most effective\nsecretaries-general, died in a plane crash. Months later he was posthumously\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1964, Hammarskj\u00f6ld's successor, U Thant,\ndeployed the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, which would become one of the\nUN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.\n\nWith the spread of decolonization in the 1960s, the UN's membership shot up\ndue to an influx of newly independent nations. In 1960 alone, 17 new states\njoined the UN, 16 of them from Africa. On 25 October 1971, with opposition\nfrom the United States, but with the support of many Third World nations, the\nPeople's Republic of China was given the Chinese seat on the Security Council\nin place of the Republic of China (also known as Taiwan). The vote was widely\nseen as a sign of waning American influence in the organization. Third World\nnations organized themselves into the Group of 77 under the leadership of\nAlgeria, which briefly became a dominant power at the UN. On 10 November 1975,\na bloc comprising the Soviet Union and Third World nations passed a\nresolution, over strenuous American and Israeli opposition, declaring Zionism\nto be a form of racism. The resolution was repealed on 16 December 1991,\nshortly after the end of the Cold War.\n\nWith an increasing Third World presence and the failure of UN mediation in\nconflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam, and Kashmir, the UN increasingly\nshifted its attention to its secondary goals of economic development and\ncultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN budget for social and economic\ndevelopment was far greater than its peacekeeping budget.[_citation needed_]"

Between 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council\nresolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than\ntenfold. The UN negotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War, launched a\nsuccessful peacekeeping mission in Namibia, and oversaw democratic elections\nin post-apartheid South Africa and post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. In 1991, the UN\nauthorized a US-led coalition that repulsed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Brian\nUrquhart, the under-secretary-general of the UN from 1971 to 1985, later\ndescribed the hopes raised by these successes as a \"false renaissance\" for the\norganization, given the more troubled missions that followed.\n\nBeginning in the last decades of the Cold War, critics of the UN condemned the\norganization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, American\nPresident Ronald Reagan withdrew the United States' funding from the United\nNations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (or UNESCO) over\nallegations of mismanagement, followed by the United Kingdom and Singapore.\nBoutros Boutros-Ghali, the secretary-general from 1992 to 1996, initiated a\nreform of the Secretariat, somewhat reducing the size of the organization. His\nsuccessor, Kofi Annan, initiated further management reforms in the face of\nthreats from the US to withhold its UN dues.\n\nThough the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one\nnation against another, in the early 1990s the UN faced several simultaneous,\nserious crises within Somalia, Haiti, Mozambique, and the nations that\npreviously made up Yugoslavia. The UN mission in Somalia was widely viewed as\na failure after the United States' withdrawal following casualties in the\nBattle of Mogadishu. The UN mission to Bosnia faced worldwide ridicule for its\nindecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing. In 1994, the\nUN Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the Rwandan genocide\namidst indecision in the Security Council.\n\nFrom the late 1990s to the early 2000s, international interventions authorized\nby the UN took a wider variety of forms. The United Nations Security Council\nResolution 1244 authorized the NATO-led Kosovo Force beginning in 1999. The UN\nmission in the Sierra Leone Civil War was supplemented by a British military\nintervention. The invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 was overseen by NATO. In\n2003, the United States invaded Iraq despite failing to pass a UN Security\nCouncil resolution for authorization, prompting a new round of questioning of\nthe UN's effectiveness.\n\nUnder the eighth secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, the UN intervened with\npeacekeepers in crises such as the War in Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu\nconflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and sent observers and\nchemical weapons inspectors to the Syrian Civil War. In 2013, an internal\nreview of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009\nconcluded that the organization had suffered a \"systemic failure\". In 2010,\nthe organization suffered the worst loss of life in its history, when 101\npersonnel died in the Haiti earthquake. Acting under the United Nations\nSecurity Council Resolution 1973 in 2011, NATO countries intervened in the\nFirst Libyan Civil War.\n\nThe Millennium Summit was held in 2000 to discuss the UN's role in the 21st\ncentury. The three-day meeting was the largest gathering of world leaders in\nhistory, and it culminated in the adoption by all member states of the\nMillennium Development Goals (or MDGs), a commitment to achieve international\ndevelopment in areas such as poverty reduction, gender equality and public\nhealth. Progress towards these goals, which were to be met by 2015, was\nultimately uneven. The 2005 World Summit reaffirmed the UN's focus on\npromoting development, peacekeeping, human rights and global security. The\nSustainable Development Goals (or SDGs) were launched in 2015 to succeed the\nMillennium Development Goals.\n\nIn addition to addressing global challenges, the UN has sought to improve its\naccountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society\nand fostering a global constituency. In an effort to enhance transparency, in\n2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for\nsecretary-general. On 1 January 2017, Portuguese diplomat Ant\u00f3nio Guterres,\nwho had previously served as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the\nninth secretary-general. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his\nadministration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts,\nmore effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be\nmore responsive and versatile to international needs.\n\nOn 13 June 2019, the UN signed a Strategic Partnership Framework with the\nWorld Economic Forum in order to \"jointly accelerate\" the implementation of\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n\nIn 2025, the UN began facing a financial crisis resulting from delays in\nmember state due payments. A major problem is that the United States, a major\ncontributor, often intentionally does not pay in full and delays its payments\nin order to influence the UN, such as on topics like the Gaza war, as the\nexistence of the UN relies on such payments. Other countries have begun to\nfollow suit, triggering a financial crisis. In 19 May 2025, only 61 countries\npaid their dues on time and in full. The crisis is causing massive budget cuts\nwithin the UN, with the UN warning that millions of lives are being put at\nrisk."

Since\nthe UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily\nprovided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes nicknamed \"Blue\nHelmets\" because they wear distinctive blue helmets. Peacekeeping forces as a\nwhole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.\n\nThe UN has carried out 71 peacekeeping operations since 1947, and As of April\n2021[update], over 88,000 peacekeeping personnel from 121 nations have been\ndeployed on missions. The largest is the United Nations Mission in South Sudan\n(or UNMISS), which has close to 19,200 uniformed personnel, and the smallest,\nthe United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (or UNMOGIP),\nconsists of 113 civilians and experts charged with monitoring the ceasefire in\nJammu and Kashmir. UN peacekeepers with the United Nations Truce Supervision\nOrganization (or UNTSO) have been stationed in the Middle East since 1948, the\nlongest-running active peacekeeping mission.\n\nA study by the RAND Corporation in 2005 found the UN to be successful in two-\nthirds of its peacekeeping efforts. It compared efforts at nation-building by\nthe UN to those of the United States and found that 87.5% of UN cases are at\npeace, as compared with 50% of U.S. cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human\nSecurity Report documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides, and\nhuman rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence,\nalbeit circumstantial, that international activism \u2013 mostly spearheaded by the\nUN \u2013 has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict. Situations in\nwhich the UN has not only acted to keep the peace but also intervened include\nthe Korean War and the authorization of intervention in Iraq after the Gulf\nWar. Further studies published between 2008 and 2021 determined UN\npeacekeeping operations to be more effective at ensuring long-lasting peace\nand minimizing civilian casualties.\n\nThe UN Buffer Zone in Cyprus was established in 1974 following the Turkish\ninvasion of Cyprus.\n\nThe UN has also drawn criticism for perceived failures. In many cases, member\nstates have shown reluctance to achieve or enforce Security Council\nresolutions. Disagreements in the Security Council about military action and\nintervention are seen as having failed to prevent the Bangladesh genocide in\n1971, the Cambodian genocide in the 1970s, and the Rwandan genocide in 1994.\nSimilarly, UN inaction is blamed for failing to either prevent the Srebrenica\nmassacre or complete the peacekeeping operations during the Somali Civil War.\nUN peacekeepers have also been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes,\nand sexual abuse during various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic\nRepublic of the Congo, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan, Burundi, and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.\nScientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the source of the 2010s Haiti\ncholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 people.\n\nA Nepalese soldier on a peacekeeping deployment providing security at a rice\ndistribution site in Haiti during 2010\n\nIn addition to peacekeeping, the UN is also active in encouraging disarmament.\nRegulation of armaments was included in the writing of the UN Charter in 1945\nand was envisioned as a way of limiting the use of human and economic\nresources for their creation. The advent of nuclear weapons came only weeks\nafter the signing of the charter, resulting in the first resolution of the\nfirst General Assembly meeting calling for specific proposals for \"the\nelimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and of all other major\nweapons adaptable to mass destruction\". The UN has been involved with arms-\nlimitation treaties such as the Outer Space Treaty, the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the Seabed Arms Control Treaty, the\nBiological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Ottawa\nTreaty. Three UN bodies oversee arms proliferation issues: the International\nAtomic Energy Agency, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\nand the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory\nCommission. Additionally, many peacekeeping missions focus on disarmament:\nseveral operations in West Africa disarmed roughly 250,000 former combatants\nand secured tens of thousands of weapons and millions of munitions."

The document proclaims\nbasic civil, political and economic rights common to all human beings, though\nits effectiveness towards achieving these ends has been disputed since its\ndrafting. The Declaration serves as a \"common standard of achievement for all\npeople and all nations\" rather than a legally binding document, but it has\nbecome the basis of two binding treaties, the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and\nCultural Rights. In practice, the UN is unable to take significant action\nagainst human rights abuses without a Security Council resolution, though it\ndoes substantial work in investigating and reporting abuses.\n\nIn 1979, the General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women; followed by the Convention on the\nRights of the Child in 1989. With the end of the Cold War, the push for human\nrights action took on new impetus. The United Nations Commission on Human\nRights was formed in 1993 to oversee human rights issues for the UN, following\nthe recommendation of that year's World Conference on Human Rights. Jacques\nFomerand, a scholar of the UN, describes the organization's mandate as \"broad\nand vague\", with only \"meagre\" resources to carry it out. In 2006, it was\nreplaced by a Human Rights Council consisting of 47 nations. Also in 2006, the\nGeneral Assembly passed a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People, and\nin 2011 it passed its first resolution recognizing the rights of members of\nthe LGBTQ+ community.\n\nOther UN bodies responsible for women's rights issues include the United\nNations Commission on the Status of Women, the United Nations Development Fund\nfor Women and the United Nations International Research and Training Institute\nfor the Advancement of Women.

Including specialized\nagencies of the UN, the UN System Chief Executives Board for Coordination\nreports total expenses of $67.4 billion in 2022 for 43 United Nations\nentities.\n\nThe UN is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from its member\nstates. The General Assembly approves the regular budget and determines the\nassessment for each member. This is broadly based on the relative capacity of\neach nation to pay, as measured by its gross national income (or GNI), with\nadjustments for external debt and low per capita income.\n\nThe Assembly has established the principle that the UN should not be unduly\ndependent on any one member to finance its operations. Thus, there is a\n\"ceiling\" rate, setting the maximum amount that any member can be assessed for\nthe regular budget. In December 2000, the Assembly revised the scale of\nassessments in response to pressure from the United States. As part of that\nrevision, the regular budget ceiling was reduced from 25% to 22%. For the\nleast developed countries (or LDCs), a ceiling rate of 0.01% is applied. In\naddition to the ceiling rates, the minimum amount assessed to any member\nnation (or \"floor\" rate) is set at 0.001% of the UN budget ($31,000 for the\ntwo-year budget 2021\u20132022).\n\nA large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and\nsecurity, and this budget is assessed separately from the main organizational\nbudget. The peacekeeping budget for the 2021\u20132022 fiscal year is $6.38\nbillion, supporting 66,839 personnel deployed in 12 missions worldwide. UN\npeace operations are funded by assessments, using a formula derived from the\nregular funding scale that includes a weighted surcharge for the five\npermanent Security Council members, who must approve all peacekeeping\noperations. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment\nrates for less developed countries. The largest contributors to the UN\npeacekeeping budget for 2023\u20132024 are: the United States (26.94%), China\n(18.68%), Japan (8.03%), Germany (6.11%), the United Kingdom (5.35%), France\n(5.28%), Italy (3.18%), Canada (2.62%), South Korea (2.57%) and Russia\n(2.28%).\n\nSpecial UN programmes not included in the regular budget, such as UNICEF and\nthe World Food Programme, are financed by voluntary contributions from member\ngovernments, corporations, and private individuals."

The UN as a whole was awarded the prize in 2001, sharing\nit with Annan. In 2007, the IPCC received the prize \"for their efforts to\nbuild up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and\nto lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such\nchange.\"\n\nOn March 21st 2025 the joint Universities of Leuven and Louvain (Belgium)\nawarded the UNO a Honorary degree which was given in the hands of Ant\u00f3nio\nGuterres."

Southern nations tend to favour a more empowered UN with a\nstronger General Assembly, allowing them a greater voice in world affairs,\nwhile Northern nations prefer an economically laissez-faire UN that focuses on\ntransnational threats such as terrorism.\n\nThere have been numerous calls for the UN Security Council's membership to be\nincreased, for different ways of electing the UN's secretary-general, and for\na UN Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA).\n\nIn the context of ongoing United Nations reform discussions, Noble World\nFoundation (NWF) proposes changing the structure of the United Nations\nSecurity Council (UNSC) by shifting membership and veto power from individual\nstates to regional organizations like the European Union. This proposed shift\nis in line with the UNSC's existing practice of basing the selection of non-\npermanent members on regional representation. Shifting to regional\norganization-based membership in the UNSC aims to reduce deadlock caused by\nindividual state vetoes. A prime example of this issue was observed on 25\nFebruary 2022, when Russia used its veto power to block a resolution against\nits invasion of Ukraine, thereby underscoring a significant weakness in the\nUNSC's functioning. NWF's proposal is intended to improve the effectiveness\nand decision-making process within the UNSC.\n\nIn response to concerns regarding the pace of progress under the United\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), recent studies have\nsuggested institutional reforms to enhance the integration of ecological\nconcerns in UN decision-making processes. Scholars affiliated with the Planet\nPolitics Institute and The Planetary Democrats have proposed the creation of\nan Earth System Council, modelled after the UNSC, and a Planetary Parliament,\nalongside the proposed UNPA, to provide formal representation for ecological\ninterests within the UN system."

Future French president Charles de Gaulle criticized the UN,\nfamously calling it a _machin_ (contraption), and was not convinced that a\nglobal security alliance would help maintain world peace, preferring direct\ndefence treaties between countries.\n\nFollowing the Chinese Civil War, the government of China was disputed between\nthe Chinese Nationalist Party and the Chinese Communist Party. After the\nfoundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC) on 1 October 1949, the\ngovernment of the Republic of China (ROC) retreated to the island of Taiwan,\ncontinuing to claim that it was the sole government of China. After the civil\nwar, the United Nations continued recognizing the ROC as the official\ngovernment of China. In 1971, amid growing debate over the representation of\nthe Chinese people on the mainland, the General Assembly passed a resolution\nrecognizing the PRC as _\"the only legitimate representatives of China to the\nUnited Nations.\"_ Critics[_who?_] allege that this position reflects a failure\nof the organization's development goals and guidelines, and it garnered\nrenewed scrutiny during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Taiwan was denied\nmembership into the World Health Organization despite its relatively effective\nresponse to the virus.

American Senator Joseph\nMcCarthy claimed that the UN Secretariat under Secretary-General Lie harboured\nAmerican communists, leading to further pressure that the UN chief resign. The\nUnited States saw nascent opposition to the UN in the 1960s, particularly\namongst conservatives, with groups such as the John Birch Society stating that\nthe organization was an instrument for communism.

When the UN tried\nto provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs,\nwhose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the UN's excessive\ncaution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Sahnoun warned that if radical reform\nwere not undertaken, then the UN would continue to respond to such crises with\ninept improvisation.\n\nBeyond specific instances or areas of alleged ineffectiveness, some scholars\ndebate the overall effectiveness of the UN. Adherents to the realist school of\ninternational relations take a pessimistic position, arguing that the UN is\nnot an effective organization because it is dominated and constrained by great\npowers. Liberal scholars counter that it is an effective organization because\nit has proved capable of solving many problems by working around the\nrestrictions imposed by powerful member states.
