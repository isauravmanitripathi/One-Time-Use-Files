        "generated_section_content_md": "The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission was created by the **Convention\nfor the Establishment of an Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission** , signed\nbetween the United States and Costa Rica on May 31, 1949. The Convention was\nsigned by United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson and Costa Rica's\nAmbassador to the United States, Mario Echandi Jim\u00e9nez. A number of additional\ncountries later joined the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission. Each\ncountry is represented by up to four Commissioners.\n\nIn 2003, the members of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission signed the\nAntigua Convention, strengthening the Commission's powers. Most members of the\nCommission ratified the Antigua Convention between 2004 and 2009, Canada\nincluded. The U.S. ratified the Antigua Convention in February 2016.\n\nThe headquarters of the IATTC are located in La Jolla, San Diego, California,\nUnited States."

This\nAgreement and its predecessor, the 1992 La Jolla Agreement, have been\nspectacularly successful in meeting this objective, as shown by the reduction\nin mortality of dolphins incidental to fishing.\n\nDuring 2013 95.4% of all sets made on tuna associated with dolphins were\naccomplished with no mortality or serious injury to the dolphins. Furthermore,\nthe total mortality of dolphins in the fishery has been reduced from about\n132,000 in 1986 to about 800 in 2013.[_citation needed_]"

        "generated_section_content_md": "The IATTC, through the Achotines Laboratory is a major contributor of research\nin the early life history of tropical tunas. The Achotines Laboratory was\nestablished as part of the IATTC's Tuna-Billfish Program. It is one of the few\nresearch facilities in the world designed specifically for studies of the\nearly life history of tropical tunas. As tunas are pelagic (open-ocean) fish\nthey are difficult to study in their natural habitat. Little is known from\nstudies of live tunas of their reproductive activities or early life history\n(egg, larval, and early-juvenile stages), and for that reason the IATTC\nestablished a research laboratory to focus on these aspects of tuna biology.\nThe Achotines Laboratory provides a unique setting for studying the\nreproductive behavior and early life stages of tropical tunas. While tunas are\nthe main focus at the Laboratory, there are ample facilities to support\nresearch in other areas of marine and terrestrial science."
