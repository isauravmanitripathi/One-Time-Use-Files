It aims to extend\nthe EU internal energy market to wider Southeast Europe. The members commit to\nimplement relevant EU energy _acquis communautaire_ , to develop an adequate\nregulatory framework and to liberalize their energy markets in line with the\n_acquis_ under the founding Treaty."

The Energy Community legal framework covers\nlegislation in the fields of energy, environment, and competition of the EU\nlegislation.\n\nAfter entry into force, the treaty _acquis_ has been extended on several\noccasions. It now also includes legislation in relation to security of supply,\nenergy efficiency, oil, renewable energy, statistics, infrastructure and\nclimate.\n\nIn line with the update at the EU level, the Energy Community transposes and\nimplements the EU's Third Energy Package since September 2011. The 2021\nMinisterial Council adopted five key legislative acts stemming from the EU's\nClean energy for all Europeans package. Renewables, energy efficiency and\ngreenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030 will be adopted at the next\nMinisterial Council in 2022, following the finalization of a study by the\nEuropean Commission."

Mandated by the Ministerial\nCouncil, the European Commission had the first round of formal negotiations\nwith Moldova and Ukraine in late 2008. After three negotiation rounds, the\ntechnical negotiations were concluded in 2009. The Ministerial Council,\nhowever, made the membership conditional on legislative amendments. In\nconcrete terms, it requested both countries to revise their gas laws and to\nalign them with the EU's Gas Directive 2003/55/EC. Whilst Moldova became a\nfull-fledged member as of 1 May 2010, Ukraine officially acceded to the Energy\nCommunity on 1 February 2011.\n\nGeorgia applied for full membership in 2014 and joined the organization as a\nfully-fledged member on 1 July 2017."

The signing of the memorandum took\nplace in November 2002 by Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,\nGreece, FYR of Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, and Turkey.\n\nThe 2003 revision added natural gas to the scope of work. Under the Athens\nMemorandum a South-East Europe Regional Energy Market was envisioned to form\npart of the EU's internal energy market. The Athens Memorandum also set up a\nnumber of institutions, which collectively are known as the 'Athens Process'.\nIn 2004, the Athens Forum meeting decided to name the process 'Energy\nCommunity'. at the same time the location of future institutions was agreed."

The Energy Community _acquis_ makes an explicit\nreference to public service obligations and customer protection. Whilst the\nTreaty may lack a legally binding _acquis_ on social dialogue, the Contracting\nParties have a legally binding obligation to foster social dimension within\nthe process. In October 2007, the Parties signed the Memorandum of\nUnderstanding on Social Issues in the context of Energy Community. The\nMemorandum recognizes that economic development and social progress are\nmutually linked and should go hand in hand. It also spells out the importance\nand the necessity to involve social partners in the reform process. Ukraine\nand Moldova signed the Declaration of Memorandum of Understanding on Social\nIssues in October 2011.\n\nEnvironmental organizations from south-eastern Europe criticized the process\nin December 2008 as they believed that the ECSEE contains insufficient\nsafeguard mechanisms to ensure that the well-intentioned promotion of energy\nefficiency and renewable energy is not drowned out by the promotion of large\nand often environmentally harmful coal and hydropower plants. The Energy\nCommunity Ministerial Council decided to establish a task force in energy\nefficiency in 2007. It was renamed in 2013 to Energy Efficiency Coordination\nGroup (EECG), providing a broad platform for cooperation between\nrepresentatives of ministries and agencies in charge for energy and energy\nefficiency from Contracting Parties, Observer Countries and Participants.\nSince 2009 the Energy Community implements the core EU energy efficiency\n_acquis_. In the area of renewable energy the discussion to adopt the EU\nrenewable energy directive started already in 2008. The Ministerial Council\nestablished a renewable energy task force in 2009 and adopted the Directive\n2009/28/EC with binding renewable energy targets for 2020 in October 2012. In\nOctober 2015, the ministers decided to re-establish the renewable energy task\nforce. The Energy Community Task Force on Environment has been operational\nsince Spring 2011."
