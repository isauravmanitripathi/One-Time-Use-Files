        "generated_section_content_md": "Solar energy initiative launched in 2015\n\nWorld map with the Torrid Zone, the area between the Tropics of Cancer and\nCapricorn, highlighted in red.\n\nThe **International Solar Alliance** (**ISA**) is an alliance of more than 120\nsignatory countries, most being **sunshine countries** , which lie either\ncompletely or partly between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.\nThe primary objective of the alliance is to work for the efficient consumption\nof solar energy to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. This initiative was\nfirst proposed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a speech in November\n2015 at Wembley Stadium in which he referred to sunshine countries as\n_Suryaputra_ (\"Sons of the Sun\"). The alliance is a treaty-based inter-\ngovernmental organization. Countries that do not fall within the Tropics can\njoin the alliance and enjoy all benefits as other members, with the exception\nof voting rights.\n\nBangladesh boasts the world's most extensive off-grid solar power initiative,\na valuable source of insights and guidance for other nations seeking to\nenhance availability of economical and eco-friendly electricity. Through the\nutilization of solar energy, this initiative has facilitated electricity\naccess for 20 million residents of Bangladesh.\n\nThe initiative was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the India\nAfrica Summit, and a meeting of member countries ahead of the 2015 United\nNations Climate Change Conference in Paris in November 2015. The framework\nagreement of the International Solar Alliance opened for signatures in\nMarrakesh, Morocco, in November 2016, and 102 countries joined."

In January 2016, Narendra Modi,\nand the then French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande jointly laid the foundation\nstone of the ISA Headquarters and inaugurated the interim Secretariat at the\nNational Institute of Solar Energy (NISE) in Gwal Pahari, Gurugram, India. The\nIndian government has dedicated five acres of land on the NISE campus for its\nfuture headquarters; it also has contributed \u20b91.75 billion (US$21 million) to\nthe fund to build a campus and for meeting expenditures for the first five\nyears.\n\nThe alliance is also called International Agency for Solar Policy and\nApplication (IASPA)."

The launching of such an alliance in\nParis also sends a strong signal to the global communities about the sincerity\nof the developing nations towards their concern about climate change and to\nswitch to a low-carbon growth path. India has pledged a target of installing\n175 GW of renewable energy of which 100 GW will be solar energy by 2022 and\nreduction in emission intensity by 33\u201335% by 2030 to let solar energy reach to\nthe most unconnected villages and communities and also towards creating a\nclean planet. India's pledge to the Paris summit offered to bring 40% of its\nelectricity generation capacity (not actual production) from non-fossil\nsources (renewable, large hydro, and nuclear) by 2030. It is based on world\ncooperation."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The area of Earth located in between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of\nCapricorn is called the tropical (torrid) zone. This is the part of the world\nin which the sun can appear directly overhead, and that more-direct exposure\nmeans that the sun's actual effect is greater here; anywhere north or south of\nthis zone, sunlight always reaches the earth's surface at an angle and is\ncorrespondingly less intense. The sunniest countries of the world are on the\nAfrican continent, ranging from Somalia- Horn of Africa-, east to Niger, west\nand north to Egypt.\n\nFor India, possible additional benefits from the alliance can be a\nstrengthening of ties with the major African countries and increasing goodwill\nfor India among them."

By 17 November,\nGuinea Bissau, Fiji, France also signed the agreement. On 6 November 2017,\nIndia's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj held a meeting with Guinea's\nForeign Minister, Mamady Toure. During the course of this meeting, Mamady\nToure handed over Guinea's Instrument of Accession to the India-initiated\nInternational Solar Alliance (ISA). Vanuatu and Liberia also signed the\nagreement.\n\nSubsequently, an additional 107 countries joined the agreement, incl. many\nmajor countries, such as the United States, Japan, Algeria, Peru, Chile,\nParaguay, France, Brazil, India, Argentina and Australia. A conclave started\nfrom 30 November 2015 for the sunshine grouping, called the InSPA\n(International Agency for Solar Policy & Application)."
