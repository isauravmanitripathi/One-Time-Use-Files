The OPCW,\nwith its 193 member states, has its seat in The Hague, Netherlands; it\noversees the global endeavour for the permanent and verifiable elimination of\nchemical weapons.\n\nThe organisation promotes and verifies the adherence to the Chemical Weapons\nConvention, which prohibits the use of chemical weapons and requires their\ndestruction. Verification consists both of evaluation of declarations by\nmember states and onsite inspections.\n\nThe organisation was awarded the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize \"for its extensive\nefforts to eliminate chemical weapons\". Nobel Committee chairman Thorbj\u00f8rn\nJagland said, \"The conventions and the work of the OPCW have defined the use\nof chemical weapons as a taboo under international law\"."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The headquarters of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons\n\nThe Hague was chosen as the location for the seat of the organisation after a\nsuccessful lobby of the Dutch government, competing against Vienna and Geneva.\nThe organisation has its headquarters next to the World Forum Convention\nCentre (where it holds its yearly Conference of States Parties) and an\nequipment store and laboratory facility in Rijswijk. The headquarters were\nofficially opened by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on 20 May 1998. and\nconsist of an eight-story building built in a semi-circle. A _permanent\nmemorial to all victims_ is present at the back of the building and is open to\nthe public.\n\nThe OPCW headquarters building was designed by American architect Gerhard\nKallmann of Kallmann McKinnell & Wood.\n\nThe first Director-General only served about one year of his second term,\nafter which, in April 2002, he was removed from office on grounds of lack of\nconfidence by the member states. It was argued by _The Guardian_ 's columnist\nGeorge Monbiot that Director-General Jos\u00e9 Bustani was being forced out by the\nU.S. government, despite the convention insisting the OPCW \"shall not seek or\nreceive instructions from any government\"; the US had tried to persuade Brazil\nto recall Bustani. Monbiot wrote that the U.S. had tried other measures,\nalthough the convention also indicates that states should \"not seek to\ninfluence\" staff. In line with his mandate, Bustani wanted Iraq to sign the\nconvention thus allowing international chemical weapons monitors into Iraq and\nthus potentially impeding the U.S. push for war against Iraq. The U.S. gave\nthree main arguments for the removal of Bustani's from his position:\n\"polarising and confrontational conduct\", \"mismanagement issues\" and \"advocacy\nof inappropriate roles for the OPCW\". The removal was subsequently determined\nto be improper by an Administrative Tribunal of the International Labour\nOrganization and consequently Bustani was awarded \u20ac50,000 in moral damages,\nhis pay for the remainder of his second term, and his legal costs.\n\nOn 11 October 2013, the Norwegian Nobel Committee announced that the OPCW had\nbeen awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for \"extensive work to eliminate chemical\nweapons\". The committee further indicated how \"Recent events in Syria, where\nchemical weapons have again been put to use, have underlined the need to\nenhance the efforts to do away with such weapons.\" In the year ending\nSeptember 2014, the OPCW had overseen the destruction of some 97 per cent of\nSyria's declared chemical weapons.\n\nIn 2014, The OPCW\u2013The Hague Award was established to honour select individuals\nand institutions by highlighting their exceptional contributions towards the\ngoal of a world permanently free of chemical weapons. The award was created as\na legacy of the OPCW winning the 2013 Nobel Peace Prize. The OPCW\u2014The Hague\nAward fund was created using the approximately \u20ac900,000 monetary prize which\naccompanied the Nobel Peace Prize, and is also supported financially by the\nCity of The Hague, where the OPCW is based.\n\nOn 13 April 2018, the OPCW became the target of an attempted cyberattack by\nRussian GRU agents. The agents were detained by Dutch Intelligence agents with\nhacking equipment in their possession. The agents were later expelled from the\ncountry. The British Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright alleged that the\nattempted cyberattack was meant to interfere with the OPCW investigation into\nthe 2018 Salisbury poisonings.\n\nIn June 2018, the OPCW voted to expand its own powers, allowing itself to\nassign blame for a contravention of its regulations.\n\nIn November 2019, a unanimous agreement of OPCW member states allowed the\naddition of the Novichok agents to \"list of controlled substances\" of the CWC\n\"in one of the first major changes to the treaty since it was agreed in the\n1990s\" in response to the 2018 poisonings in the UK."

The\nprincipal body is the **Conference of the States Parties (CSP)** , which\nnormally is convened yearly, and in which all countries can participate, with\nequal voting rights. Countries are generally represented in the conference by\na permanent representative to the organisation, which in most cases is also\nthe ambassador to the Netherlands. The conference decides on all main topics\nregarding the organisation (for example, taking retaliation measures) and the\nconvention (approving guidelines, imposing retaliating measures against\nmembers).\n\nThe **Executive Council (EC)** is the executive organ of the organisation and\nconsists of 41 states parties, which are appointed by the conference on a two-\nyear term. The council amongst others oversees the budget and cooperates with\nthe General Secretariat on all matters related to the convention.\n\nThe **Technical Secretariat (TS)** applies most of the activities mandated by\nthe council and is the body where most of the employees of the organisation\nwork. The main activities of the OPCW are performed by the inspection and the\nverification divisions.\n\nAll states parties make contributions to the OPCW budget, based on a modified\nUN scale of assessments. The OPCW budget for 2020 is \u20ac70,958,760"

The vote was won by a margin of 82 to 24, which\nexceeded the two-thirds majority needed for the motion to pass."

For\nSchedule 1 and 2 facilities, a mass balance is prepared to identify whether\nall produced chemicals can be accounted for and whether the amounts are\nconsistent with the declarations made by member states. Furthermore, at\nSchedule 2 and 3 facilities clues are investigated whether, contrary to the\ndeclaration and to the rules in the convention, Schedule 1 chemicals are\nproduced. At Schedule 3 and DOC, the main aim is to check the declaration and\nto verify the absence of Schedule 2 and Schedule 1 production units. The time\nlimit Schedule 2 inspections is 96 hours while Schedule 3 and DOC inspections\ncan take a maximum of 24 hours. There is no time limit on Schedule 1\ninspections."

Bustani was dismissed following the vote,\nheld on 22 April 2002, with 48 states voting in favor, 7 against and 43\nabstaining. Subsequently, Bustani accused the United States of having provoked\nhis impeachment because he had succeeded in convincing Saddam Hussein to\nratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, which implied inspection of the Iraqi\narsenal by OPCW investigators and would have thwarted the American plan of an\ninvasion of Iraq. He also lodged a complaint before the Administrative\nTribunal of the International Labour Organization, which, by a judgment of 16\nJuly 2003, quashed the dismissal and condemned the OPCW to compensation for\nmaterial and moral damage. Bustani did not seek to be reinstated in office."
