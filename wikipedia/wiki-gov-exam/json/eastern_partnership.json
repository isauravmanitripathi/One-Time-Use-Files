The EaP is\nintended to provide a forum for discussions regarding trade, economic\nstrategy, travel agreements, and other issues between the EU and its Eastern\nEuropean neighbours. It also aims at building a common area of shared values\nof democracy, prosperity, stability, and increased cooperation. The project\nwas initiated by Poland and a subsequent proposal was prepared in co-operation\nwith Sweden. It was presented by the foreign ministers of Poland and Sweden at\nthe EU's General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 26 May\n2008. The Eastern Partnership was inaugurated by the EU in Prague, Czech\nRepublic on 7 May 2009.\n\nThe first meeting of foreign ministers in the framework of the Eastern\nPartnership was held on 8 December 2009 in Brussels."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Eastern Partnership (EaP) was established as a specific Eastern dimension\nof the European Neighbourhood Policy, which contains both a bilateral and\nmultilateral track. The Eastern Partnership complements the Northern Dimension\nand the Union for the Mediterranean by providing an institutionalised forum\nfor discussing visa agreements, free trade deals, and strategic partnership\nagreements with the EU's eastern neighbours, while avoiding the controversial\ntopic of accession to the European Union. Its geographical scope consists of\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. Unlike the Union\nfor the Mediterranean, the Eastern Partnership does not have its own\nsecretariat, but is controlled directly by the European Commission.\n\n4th Eastern Partnership Summit,\nRiga, May 2015\n\nIn May 2008, Poland and Sweden put forward a joint proposal for an Eastern\nPartnership with Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, with\nRussia and Belarus participating in some aspects. Eventually, Belarus joined\nthe initiative as a full member, while Russia does not participate at all. The\nPolish foreign minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski said \"_We all know the EU has\nenlargement fatigue. We have to use this time to prepare as much as possible\nso that when the fatigue passes, membership becomes something natural_ \" It\nwas discussed at the European Council on 19 and 20 June 2008, along with the\nUnion for the Mediterranean. The Czech Republic endorsed the proposal\ncompletely, while Bulgaria and Romania were cautious, fearing that the Black\nSea Forum for Partnership and Dialogue and the Organization of the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation could be undermined. Meanwhile, Germany, France, and\nothers were not happy with the possibility that the Eastern Partnership could\nbe seen as a stepping stone to membership (especially for Ukraine), while\nPoland and other Eastern states have explicitly welcomed this effect.\n\nThe Eastern Partnership was officially launched in May 2009 when the Czech\nRepublic invited the leaders of the six members of the initiative. Meanwhile,\nGermany attended the summit to signal their alarm at the economic situation in\nthe East. Russia accused the EU of trying to carve out a new sphere of\ninfluence, which the EU denied, stating that they were \"responding to the\ndemands of these countries...and the economic reality is that most of their\ntrade is done with the EU\"."

Apart from values, the\ndeclaration says the region is of \"strategic importance\" and the EU has an\n\"interest in developing an increasingly close relationship with its Eastern\npartners...\"\n\nThe inclusion of Belarus prompts the question whether values or geopolitics\nare paramount in the initiative. EU diplomats agree that the country's\nauthoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has done little to merit\ninvolvement in the policy at this stage. But the EU fears Russia will\nstrengthen its grip on Minsk if it is left out.

Also, there has been some\nprogress in liberalising the visa regime despite persistent problems in the EU\nMember States' visa approach towards Ukrainians.[_citation needed_]\n\nThat is why Ukraine has a specific view of the Eastern Partnership Project.\nAccording to the Ukrainian presidency, it should correspond, in case of his\ncountry, to the strategic foreign policy objective, i.e. the integration with\nthe EU. Yet, the Eastern Partnership documents (the European Council\nDeclaration of May 2009) do not confirm such priorities as political and\neconomic integration or lifting visas.\n\nUkraine has expressed enthusiasm about the project. Ukraine deputy premier\nHryhoriy Nemyria said that the project is the way to modernise the country and\nthat they welcome the Eastern Partnership policy, because it uses 'de facto'\nthe same instruments as for EU candidates.\n\nUnder the Eastern Partnership, Poland and Ukraine have reached a new agreement\nreplacing visas with simplified permits for Ukrainians residing within 30 km\nof the border.

It's about pulling countries\nfrom the positions they want to take as sovereign states\", Russian foreign\nminister Sergei Lavrov has stated.\n\nSweden, the co-author of the Eastern Partnership project together with Poland,\nrejected Mr Lavrov's position as \"completely unacceptable\". \"The Eastern\nPartnership is not about spheres of influence. The difference is that these\ncountries themselves opted to join\", Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt said\nat the Brussels Forum. The EU's position on Georgia is not 'blackmail' but \"is\nabout upholding the principles of the EU and international law, which Russia\nshould also be respecting\", he added.\n\nIn November 2009, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed the Eastern\nPartnership as useless: \"Frankly speaking, I don't see any special use (in the\nprogram) and all the participants of this partnership are confirming this to\nme\". However a few days later Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that\nRussia does not rule out joining the EU's Eastern Partnership programme.\nRussia maintained its opposition towards the EPP. For instance, after the\nWarsaw Summit 2011 of the EPP, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin stated\nthat due to the economic crisis in the EU, Ukraine would probably not join the\nEU. Instead of joining the EU, Putin offered a Russia \u2013 Ukraine relationship\nwhich he said would provide a more competitive and productive economic\nprocess.\n\nIn May 2015, President of the European Council Donald Tusk stated that Russia\nwas \"[compensating for] its shortcomings by destructive, aggressive and\nbullying tactics against its neighbours\" while German Chancellor Angela Merkel\nsaid that \"the EU makes a crystal clear difference with Russia.

The EaP CSF consists of six national platforms and five thematic\nworking groups, which are represented by an annually elected Steering\nCommittee composed of 13 members. The Secretariat of the EaP CSF is based in\nBrussels. The EaP CSF meets annually to discuss the latest developments and to\nset their working programme. The first meeting took place in Brussels in 2009.\nThe last EaP CSF Civil Society Summit meeting \u2013 which continued the tradition\nof its preceding 16 Annual Assemblies - took place in Vienna in November 2024.\nDuring the meeting, 90 civil society organizations from the EaP countries and\nthe EU adopted a resolution detailing key recommendations on the future of the\nEaP region and policy.\n\nThe EaP CSF aims to support the effective participation of civil society from\nEaP and EU countries in the process of planning, monitoring and implementing\nthe Eastern Partnership policy. It maintains a dialogue with EU and EaP\ndecision makers to democratically transform the EaP countries and guarantee\ntheir integration into the EU.\n\nIn 2011, the EaP CSF launched the Eastern Partnership Index, a data-driven\nmonitoring tool used to inform policy-making. It tracks, on a biennial scale,\nthe reform journey of the six Eastern Partnership countries towards\nsustainable democratic development and European integration.\n\nThe EaP CSF has actively advocated for greater political and financial support\nto civil society in the Eastern partnership, in light of their role in\nsupporting democratization and rule of law reforms. It has also actively\ncampaigned for an EU response to the human rights situation in Azerbaijan and\nBelarus. It also monitors the progress on the Moldovan, Ukrainian and Georgian\ncandidacies to the EU.\n\nAs of January 2025, the EaP CSF counts over 1,200 member organizations and\nremains an official interlocutor of EU institutions and EaP partner countries\nin the EaP architecture. A similar set up is unique for the EaP region, given\nthat no similar platform exists for the Western Balkans or the Southern\nNeighbourhood. The EaP CSF provides a framework for transmitting European\nvalues and norms. As a result, some scholars have attributed a socialization\nfunction to the Forum, whereby norms sponsored by the European Union are\ninternalized by participating civil society organizations."

First, conceptually the EU has limited uniform awareness\nof what it is trying to promote in its eastern neighbourhood under the aegis\nof 'shared values', 'collective norms' and 'joint ownership'. Secondly,\nempirically, the EU seems to favour a 'top-down' governance approach (based on\nrule/norm transfer and conditionality) in its relations with outsiders, which\nis clearly at odds with a voluntary idea of 'partnership', and explicitly\nlimits the input of 'the other' in the process of reform."
