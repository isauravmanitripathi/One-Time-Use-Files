        "generated_section_content_md": "Continental union of African states\n\nThe **African Union** (**AU**) is a continental union of 55 member states\nlocated on the continent of Africa. The AU was announced in the Sirte\nDeclaration in Sirte, Libya, on 9 September 1999, calling for the\nestablishment of the African Union. The bloc was launched on 9 July 2002 in\nDurban, South Africa. The intention of the AU was to replace the Organisation\nof African Unity (OAU), established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa by 32\nsignatory governments; the OAU was disbanded on 9 July 2002. The most\nimportant decisions of the AU are made by the Assembly of the African Union, a\nsemi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states.\n\nThe AU's secretariat, the African Union Commission, is based in Addis Ababa.\nThe largest city in the AU is Lagos, Nigeria, while the largest urban\nagglomeration is Cairo, Egypt. The African Union has more than 1.3 billion\npeople and an area of around 30 million km2 (12 million sq mi) and includes\nworld landmarks such as the Sahara and the Nile. The primary working languages\nare Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swahili. Within the\nAfrican Union, there are official bodies, such as the Peace and Security\nCouncil and the Pan-African Parliament.\n\nAt a G20 (Group of 20) meeting held in New Delhi, India, in 2023, the African\nUnion was admitted as a member to the G20."

To defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of its Member States.\n3. To accelerate the political and social-economic integration of the continent.\n4. To promote and defend African common positions on issues of interest to the continent and its peoples.\n5. To encourage international cooperation, taking due account of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n6. To promote peace, security, and stability on the continent.\n7. To promote democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance.\n8. To promote and protect human and peoples' rights in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and other relevant human rights instruments.\n9. To establish the necessary conditions which enable the continent to play its rightful role in the global economy and in international negotiations.\n10. To promote sustainable development at the economic, social and cultural levels as well as the integration of African economies.\n11. To promote co-operation in all fields of human activity to raise the living standards of African people.\n12. To coordinate and harmonise the policies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union.\n13. To advance the development of the continent by promoting research in all fields, in particular in science and technology.\n14. To work with relevant international partners in the eradication of preventable diseases and the promotion of good health on the continent.\n\nThe African Union is made up of both political and administrative bodies. The\nhighest decision-making organ is the Assembly of the African Union, made up of\nall the heads of state or government of member states of the AU. The Assembly\nis chaired by F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, President of the Democratic Republic of the\nCongo. The AU also has a representative body, the Pan-African Parliament,\nwhich consists of 265 members elected by the national legislatures of the AU\nmember states. Its president is Roger Nkodo Dang.\n\nOther political institutions of the AU include:\n\n* the Executive Council, made up of foreign ministers, which prepares decisions for the Assembly;\n* the Permanent Representatives Committee, made up of the ambassadors to Addis Ababa of AU member states; and\n* the Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), a civil society consultative body.\n\nThe AU Commission, the secretariat to the political structures, is chaired by\nNkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa. On 15 July 2012, Dlamini-Zuma won a\ntightly contested vote to become the first female head of the African Union\nCommission, replacing Jean Ping of Gabon.\n\nOther AU structures are hosted by different member states:\n\n* the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights is based in Banjul, the Gambia; and\n* the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and APRM Secretariats and the Pan-African Parliament are in Midrand, South Africa.\n\nThe AU's first military intervention in a member state was the May 2003\ndeployment of a peacekeeping force of soldiers from South Africa, Ethiopia,\nand Mozambique to oversee the implementation of the various agreements in\nBurundi. AU troops were also deployed in Sudan for peacekeeping during the\nDarfur Conflict, before the mission was handed over to the United Nations on 1\nJanuary 2008 via UNAMID. The AU has a peacekeeping mission in Somalia,\nconsisting of troops from Uganda and Burundi.\n\nThe AU has adopted a number of important new documents establishing norms at\nthe continental level, to supplement those already in force when it was\ncreated. These include the African Union Convention on Preventing and\nCombating Corruption (2003), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and\nGovernance (2007), the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and\nits associated Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate\nGovernance."

The conference was aimed at establishing Africa Day to annually\nmark the liberation movement concerning the willingness of the African people\nto free themselves from colonial rule, as well as subsequent attempts to unite\nAfrica, including the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which was\nestablished on 25 May 1963, and the African Economic Community in 1991.\nCritics argued that the OAU in particular did little to protect the rights and\nliberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing\nit the \"Dictators' Club\".\n\nThe idea of creating the AU was revived in the mid-1990s under the leadership\nof Libyan head of state Muammar al-Gaddafi; the heads of state and governments\nof the OAU issued the Sirte Declaration (named after Sirte, Libya) on 9\nSeptember 1999, calling for the establishment of an African Union. The\nDeclaration was followed by summits at Lom\u00e9 in 2000, when the Constitutive Act\nof the African Union was adopted, and at Lusaka in 2001, when the plan for the\nimplementation of the African Union was adopted. During the same period, the\ninitiative for the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's\nDevelopment (NEPAD) was also established.\n\nThe African Union was launched in Durban on 9 July 2002 by its first\nchairperson, former South African head of state Thabo Mbeki, at the first\nsession of the Assembly of the African Union. The second session of the\nAssembly was held in Maputo in 2003 and the third session in Addis Ababa was\nheld on 6 July 2004.\n\nSince 2010, the African Union eyes the establishment of a joint African space\nagency.\n\nBarack Obama was the first-ever sitting United States president to speak in\nfront of the African Union in Addis Ababa on 29 July 2015. During his speech,\nhe encouraged the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade\nwith the continent and lauded the signs of progress made in education,\ninfrastructure and economy. However, he also criticized a lack of democracy\nand leaders who refuse to step down, discrimination against minorities\n(including LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities) and corruption. He\nsuggested an intensified democratization and free trade to significantly\nincrease living quality for Africans."

The seat of the PAP is at Midrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. The Parliament is composed of 265 elected representatives from all 55 AU states, and intended to provide popular and civil-society participation in the processes of democratic governance. Its president is Roger Nkodo Dang, of Cameroon.\nAssembly of the African Union\n\nComposed of heads of state and heads of government of AU states, the Assembly is currently the supreme governing body of the African Union. It is gradually devolving some of its decision-making powers to the Pan-African Parliament. It meets once a year and makes its decisions by consensus or by a two-thirds majority. The current chair of the AU is President Macky Sall, President of Senegal.\nAfrican Union Commission (or Authority)\n\nThe secretariat of the African Union, composed of ten commissioners and supporting staff and headquartered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In a similar fashion to its European counterpart, the European Commission, it is responsible for the administration and coordination of the AU's activities and meetings.\nCourt of Justice of the African Union\n\nThe Constitutive Act provides for a Court of Justice to rule on disputes over interpretation of AU treaties. A protocol to set up this Court of Justice was adopted in 2003 and entered into force in 2009. It was, however, superseded by a protocol creating an African Court of Justice and Human Rights, which will incorporate the already established African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (see below) and have two chambers: one for general legal matters and one for rulings on the human rights treaties.\nExecutive Council\n\nComposed of ministers designated by the governments of member states. It decides on matters such as foreign trade, social security, food, agriculture and communications, is accountable to the Assembly, and prepares material for the Assembly to discuss and approve. It is chaired by Shawn Makuyana of Zimbabwe (2015\u2013 ).\nPermanent Representatives' Committee\n\nConsisting of nominated permanent representatives of member states, the Committee prepares the work for the Executive Council, similar to the role of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union.\nPeace and Security Council (PSC)\n\nProposed at the Lusaka Summit in 2001 and established in 2004 under a protocol to the Constitutive Act adopted by the AU Assembly in July 2002. The protocol defines the PSC as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and effective response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa. Other responsibilities conferred to the PSC by the protocol include prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, post-conflict peace building and developing common defence policies. The PSC has fifteen members elected on a regional basis by the Assembly. Similar in intent and operation to the United Nations Security Council.\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Council\n\nAn advisory organ composed of professional and civic representatives, similar to the European Economic and Social Committee. The chair of ECOSOCC, elected in 2008, is Cameroonian lawyer Akere Muna of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU).\nSpecialised Technical Committees\n\nBoth the Abuja Treaty and the Constitutive Act provide for Specialised Technical Committees to be established made up of African ministers to advise the Assembly. In practice, they have never been set up. The ten proposed themes are: Rural Economy and Agricultural Matters; Monetary and Financial Affairs; Trade, Customs, and Immigration; Industry, Science and Technology; Energy, Natural Resources, and Environment; Transport, Communications, and Tourism; Health; Labour, and Social Affairs; Education, Culture, and Human Resources.\nFinancial institutions\n\n* African Central Bank \u2013 Abuja, Nigeria\n* African Investment Bank \u2013 Tripoli, Libya\n* African Monetary Fund \u2013 Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon\n\nThese institutions have not yet been established; however, the Steering\nCommittees working on their founding have been constituted. Eventually, the AU\naims to have a single currency (the Afro).\n\nHealth\n\nThe Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), founded in 2016 and launched in 2017. Its Headquarters are in Addis Ababa Ethiopia.\nHuman rights\n\nThe African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, in existence since 1986, is established under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter) rather than the Constitutive Act of the African Union. It is the premier African human rights body, with responsibility for monitoring and promoting compliance with the African Charter. The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights was established in 2006 to supplement the work of the commission, following the entry into force of a protocol to the African Charter providing for its creation. It is planned that the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights will be merged with the Court of Justice of the African Union (see above).\nSpace\n\nThe African Space Agency was officially formed in 2023. It is headquartered in Cairo.\nEnergy\n\nThe African Energy Commission was founded in 2008, and is based in Algiers."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The principal topic for debate at the July 2007 AU summit held in Accra,\nGhana, was the creation of a Union Government, with the aim of moving towards\na United States of Africa. A study on the Union Government was adopted in late\n2006, and proposes various options for \"completing\" the African Union project.\nThere are divisions among African states on the proposals, with some (notably\nLibya) following a maximalist view leading to a common government with an AU\narmy; and others (especially the southern African states) supporting rather a\nstrengthening of the existing structures, with some reforms to deal with\nadministrative and political challenges in making the AU Commission and other\nbodies truly effective.\n\nFollowing a heated debate in Accra, the Assembly of Heads of State and\nGovernment agreed in the form of a declaration to review the state of affairs\nof the AU with a view to determining its readiness towards a Union Government.\nIn particular, the Assembly agreed to:\n\n* Accelerate the economic and political integration of the African continent, including the formation of a Union Government of Africa;\n* Conduct an audit of the institutions and organs of the AU; review the relationship between the AU and the RECs; find ways to strengthen the AU and elaborate a timeframe to establish a Union Government of Africa.\n\nThe declaration lastly noted the \"importance of involving the African peoples,\nincluding Africans in the Diaspora, in the processes leading to the formation\nof the Union Government\".\n\nFollowing this decision, a panel of eminent persons was set up to conduct the\n\"audit review\". The review team began its work on 1 September 2007. The review\nwas presented to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at the January\n2008 summit in Addis Ababa. No final decision was taken on the\nrecommendations, however, and a committee of ten heads of state was appointed\nto consider the review and report back to the July 2008 summit to be held in\nEgypt. At the July 2008 summit, a decision was once again deferred, for a\n\"final\" debate at the January 2009 summit to be held in Addis Ababa."

The\n1980 Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa and the 1991 treaty to\nestablish the African Economic Community (also referred to as the Abuja\nTreaty), proposed the creation of Regional Economic Communities (RECs) as the\nbasis for African integration, with a timetable for regional and then\ncontinental integration to follow.\n\nCurrently, there are eight RECs recognised by the AU, each established under a\nseparate regional treaty. They are:\n\n* the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)\n* the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)\n* the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD)\n* the East African Community (EAC)\n* the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)\n* the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)\n* the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)\n* the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)\n\nThe membership of many of the communities overlaps, and their rationalisation\nhas been under discussion for several years\u2014and formed the theme of the 2006\nBanjul summit.

The primary body charged with implementing\nthese objectives and principles is the Peace and Security Council. The PSC has\nthe power, among other things, to authorise peace support missions, to impose\nsanctions in case of unconstitutional change of government, and to \"take\ninitiatives and action it deems appropriate\" in response to potential or\nactual conflicts. The PSC is a decision-making body in its own right, and its\ndecisions are binding on member states.\n\nArticle 4(h) of the Constitutive Act, repeated in Article 4 of the Protocol to\nthe Constitutive Act on the PSC, also recognises the right of the Union to\nintervene in a member state in circumstances of war crimes, genocide and\ncrimes against humanity. Any decision to intervene in a member state under\nArticle 4 of the Constitutive Act will be made by the Assembly on the\nrecommendation of the PSC.\n\nSince it first met in 2004, the PSC has been active in relation to the crises\nin Darfur, Comoros, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Ivory\nCoast and other countries. It has adopted resolutions creating the AU\npeacekeeping operations in Somalia and Darfur, and imposing sanctions against\npersons undermining peace and security (such as travel bans and asset freezes\nagainst the leaders of the rebellion in Comoros). The council is in the\nprocess of overseeing the establishment of a \"standby force\" to serve as a\npermanent African peacekeeping force.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe founding treaty of the AU also called for the establishment of the African\nPeace and Security Architecture (APSA), including the African Standby Force\n(ASF), which is to be deployed in emergencies. That means, in cases of\ngenocide or other serious human-rights violations, an ASF mission can be\nlaunched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned,\nas long as it is approved by the AU. In past AU peacekeeping missions, the\nconcept was not yet applied and forces had to be mobilised from member states.\nAlthough the ASF was declared fully operational in 2016 and used from 2017\nonwards in ECOWAS, ECCAS and SADC interventions to the Gambia, Lesotho,\nMozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it has not been deployed\nin the same way as originally concieved. Instead of the PSC acting as the\nprimary initiator of ASF action as previously planned, Regional Economic\nCommunities have took charge of mobilizing ASF capabilities. In light of\ncontinued criticism, ASF reform remains a prominent topic of discussion at the\nAU."

A peace agreement aimed at ending the civil war that broke out\nfollowing the collapse of the Siad Barre regime was signed in 2006 after many\nyears of peace talks. However, the new government was almost immediately\nthreatened by further violence. In February 2007, the African Union (AU) and\nEuropean Union (EU) worked together to establish the African Union Mission in\nSomalia (AMISOM). The purpose of AMISOM was to create a foundation that would\nhopefully provide aid to some of Somalia's most vulnerable and keep the peace\nin the region. They are tasked with everything from protecting federal\ninstitutions to facilitating humanitarian relief operations. Much of the AU's\nopposition comes from an Islamic extremist group named al-Shabaab. To\ntemporarily shore up the government's military base, starting in March 2007,\nAU soldiers began arriving in Mogadishu as part of a peacekeeping force that\nwas intended by the AU to eventually be 8,000 strong. Eritrea recalled its\nambassadors to the African Union on 20 November 2009 after the African Union\ncalled on the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on them due\nto their alleged support of Somali Islamists attempting to topple the\nTransitional Federal Government of Somalia, the internationally recognised\ngovernment of Somalia which holds Somalia's seat on the African Union. On 22\nDecember 2009, the United Nations Security Council passed UNSCR 1907, which\nimposed an arms embargo on Eritrea, travel bans on Eritrean leaders, and asset\nfreezes on Eritrean officials. Eritrea strongly criticised the resolution. In\nJanuary 2011, Eritrea reestablished their mission to the AU in Addis Ababa.\n\nIn the fall of 2011, AMISOM forces, along with Kenyan and Ethiopian forces,\nlaunched a set of offensive attacks on the al-Shabaab. In these attacks,\nAMISOM forces were able to reclaim key cities including the Somali capital of\nMogadishu. In September 2013, political scientist Ethan Bueno de Mesquita\nargued that with the help of AMISOM forces, they had made it \"nearly\nimpossible for al-Shabaab to hold territory even in its former strongholds in\nsouthern Somalia\". Although much progress has been made towards peace in the\nregion, it should still be noted that African Union forces' still get attacked\nregularly. Despite AMISOM being effective, it is vastly underfunded and many\nforces lack the resources required. Funding for humanitarian relief and the\nformation of armies tends to be vastly undercut."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 2011, when the conflict in Libya began, the African Union was initially\ncriticised for doing little to prevent the conflict's escalation.\nAdditionally, the AU hesitated to take a side. It was unclear whether the AU\nsupported the Libyan regime or the rebels. This occurred as several human\nright violations were perpetrated against members of the Libyan regime. It was\nlater realised that the AU's hesitation was due to its lack of capacity and\nits inability to engage in democratic reform.\n\nThe AU attempted to mediate in the early stages of the 2011 Libyan civil war,\nforming an _ad hoc_ committee of five presidents (Congolese President Denis\nSassou Nguesso, Malian President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, Mauritanian President\nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, South African President Jacob Zuma, and Ugandan\nPresident Yoweri Museveni) to broker a truce. However, the beginning of the\nNATO-led military intervention in March 2011 prevented the committee from\ntraveling to Libya to meet with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. As a body, the\nAU sharply dissented from the United Nations Security Council's decision to\ncreate a no-fly zone over Libya, though a few member states, such as Botswana,\nGabon, Zambia, and others expressed support for the resolution.\n\nAs a result of Gaddafi's defeat at the Battle of Tripoli (the war's deciding\nbattle), in August 2011, the Arab League voted to recognise the anti-Gaddafi\nNational Transitional Council as the legitimate government of the country,\npending elections. The council has been recognised by several AU member\nstates, including two Arab League members. However, the AU Peace and Security\nCouncil voted on 26 August 2011 not to recognise it, insisting on a ceasefire\nand on the formation of a national unity government by both sides. A number of\nAU member states led by Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Rwanda requested that the AU\nrecognise the NTC as Libya's interim governing authority, and several other AU\nmember states have recognised the NTC regardless of the Peace and Security\nCouncil's decision. However, AU member states Algeria and Zimbabwe have\nindicated they will not recognise the NTC, and South Africa has expressed\nreservations as well.\n\nOn 20 September 2011, the African Union officially recognised the National\nTransitional Council as the legitimate representative of Libya.\n\nIn post-Gaddafi Libya, the African Union believes it still has an important\nresponsibility to the country despite its failure to contribute to the\nconflict when it originated. Although the African Union is there to keep\npeace, it is not a long-term solution. The goal, as stated by the AU, is to\nestablish a Libyan government that is sustainable to ensuring peace in Libya.\nTo achieve some level of peace in Libya, the AU has to moderate peace talks\nwhich are aimed at achieving compromises and power sharing accommodations as\nwell."

In 2001, the\nAU established AIDS Watch Africa to coordinate and mobilise a continent-wide\nresponse. Sub-Saharan Africa, especially southern and eastern Africa, is the\nmost affected area in the world. Though this region is home to only 6.2% of\nthe world's population, it is also home to half of the world's population\ninfected with HIV. While the measurement of HIV prevalence rates has proved\nmethodologically challenging, more than 20% of the sexually active population\nof many countries of southern Africa may be infected, with South Africa,\nBotswana, Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe all expected to have a decrease in life\nexpectancy by an average of 6.5 years. The pandemic has had massive\nimplications for the economy of the continent, reducing economic growth rates\nby 2\u20134% across Africa.\n\nIn July 2007, the AU endorsed two new initiatives to combat the AIDS crisis,\nincluding a push to recruit, train and integrate two million community health\nworkers into the continent's healthcare systems.\n\nIn January 2012, the African Union Assembly requested that the African Union\nCommission would work out \"a roadmap of shared responsibility to draw on\nAfrican efforts for a viable health funding with support of traditional and\nemerging partners to address AIDS dependency response\". Once created, the\nroadmap (as it is officially known) provided a group of solutions that would\nenhance the shared responsibility and global solidarity for AIDS, TB, and\nMalaria responses in Africa by 2015. The roadmap was organised into three\npillars: diversified financing, access to medicines, and enhanced health\ngovernance. The roadmap held stakeholders accountable for the realisation of\nthese solutions between 2012 and 2015.\n\nThe first pillar, diversified financing, ensures that countries begin to\ndevelop a country specific financial sustainability plans with clear targets,\nand identify and maximise opportunities to diversify funding sources in order\nto increase the domestic resource allocation to AIDS and other diseases.\n\nThe second pillar, access to affordable and quality-assured medicines, tries\nto promote and facilitate investing in leading medicine hub manufacturers in\nAfrica, accelerate and strengthen medicine regulatory harmonisation, and\ncreate legislation that would help to protect the knowledge of the researchers\nwho develop these life-saving medicines.\n\nThe third pillar, enhanced leadership and governance, tries to invest in\nprograms that support people and communities to prevent HIV and ensure that\nleadership at all levels is mobilised to implement the roadmap. There are\nseveral organisations that will ensure the smooth implementation of the\nroadmap, including NEPAD, UNAIDS, WHO, and several other UN partners."

The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood\nshed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for\nAfrica's wealth and bright future; the green, for African hopes and\naspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn\nwithout internal borders.\n\nThe African Union adopted its new flag at its 14th Ordinary Session of the\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government taking place in Addis Ababa 2010.\nDuring the 8th African Union Summit which took place in Addis Ababa on 29 and\n30 January 2007, the Heads of State and Government decided to launch a\ncompetition for the selection of a new flag for the Union. They prescribed a\ngreen background for the flag symbolising hope of Africa and stars to\nrepresent Member States.\n\nPursuant to this decision, the African Union Commission (AUC) organised a\ncompetition for the selection of a new flag for the African Union. The AUC\nreceived a total of 106 entries proposed by citizens of 19 African countries\nand 2 from the Diaspora. The proposals were then examined by a panel of\nexperts put in place by the African Union Commission and selected from the\nfive African regions for short listing according to the main directions given\nby the Heads of State and Government.\n\nAt the 13th Ordinary Session of the Assembly, the Heads of State and\nGovernment examined the report of the Panel and selected one among all the\nproposals. The flag is now part of the paraphernalia of the African Union and\nreplaces the old one.\n\nThe old flag of the African Union bears a broad green horizontal stripe, a\nnarrow band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad\nwhite stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again,\nthe green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its\nwealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's\ndesire for friends throughout the world. The flag has led to the creation of\nthe \"national colours\" of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with\nwhite). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many\nAfrican nations. Together the colours green, gold, and red constitute the Pan-\nAfrican colours.\n\nThe African Union has adopted the anthem \"Let Us All Unite and Celebrate\nTogether\"."
