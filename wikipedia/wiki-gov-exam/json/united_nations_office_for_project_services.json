Her appointment led to a change in direction for the organization.\nBetween 2014 and 2021 its portfolio of projects expanded from $1.14 billion to\nmore than $3.4 billion. She bragged about how she immediately saw to it that\n\"more than 1,200 pages of rules went into the trash\" and that she would\n\"rewrite (its) operational principles\" in the name of running UNOPS more like\na fast and agile business. Under her tenure, UNOPS shed its former reputation\nas an invisible go-between meant to ease contracting. UNOPS found itself with\na surplus of funds it could use for itself. However, Faremo was accused of\nmanaging the money incompetently at best, and corruptly at worst. As part of\nan initiative called the \"Sustainable Investments in Infrastructure and\nInnovation\", or S3i for short, millions of US dollars worth of donor money was\ngiven to contractors that had repeatedly failed to work on the projects they\nwere given. The UN is expected to have to write down over $25 million in bad\nloans.\n\nFaremo's deputy Vitaly Vanshelboim was placed on executive leave, as the\nUnited Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services investigated the\nallegations and audited the matter. Vanshelboim was later sacked in early\n2023. Faremo resigned in early May 2022 after an investigation by _The New\nYork Times_ drew attention to the problems under Faremo's tenure.\nInternational development news publication, Devex and blogger, Mukesh Kapila,\nalso wrote a series of articles on the matter. In 2025, Vitaly-Vanshelboi, the\nformer Deputy, was remanded in Spain for \"alleged bribery, money laundering\nand electronic fraud\". As of 2025, he is central in a corruption\ninvestigation, that is being done by the FBI. Earlier (December 2021),"
