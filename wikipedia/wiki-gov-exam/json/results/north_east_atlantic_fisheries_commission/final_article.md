## Case study: The North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) — institutional form, limits and lessons for India

This short case study examines the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) as an archetypal regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO). NEAFC’s institutional design, mandate and jurisdictional choices illustrate core features of multilateral maritime governance that are directly relevant to Indian strategic culture and national-security concerns tied to maritime resources, maritime domain awareness and multilateral cooperation.

### Overview and stated purpose
NEAFC (North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission) is a general RFMO created to manage fisheries and fishing-related activities in much of the northeast Atlantic. Formed under the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in Northeast Atlantic Fisheries (1980), NEAFC’s explicit objective is, in the Commission’s own words, “to ensure the long-term conservation and optimum utilization of the fishery resources in its Convention Area, providing sustainable economic, environmental and social benefits.”

A mapped jurisdictional caption frequently appears as “NEAFC Regulatory Area,” reflecting its geographically delimited competence for specific high-seas and straddling stocks.

### Historical development and legal basis
- Predecessor: The 1980 Convention replaced an earlier body established by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Convention of 24 January 1959. The 1980 instrument is the current multilateral legal basis for NEAFC’s measures.
- Role: NEAFC functions as a multilateral forum where contracting parties adopt conservation and enforcement measures that bind those parties under the Convention and implementing arrangements.

### Geographic scope and explicit exclusions
NEAFC’s Convention Area covers a broad swathe of the northeast Atlantic:
- From the southern tip of Greenland east to the Barents Sea, and south to Portugal.
- Included seas commonly referenced under NEAFC competence: North Sea, Irish Sea, the Nordic Seas, Barents Sea, White Sea and the remainder of the northeast Atlantic Ocean that lies outside national jurisdictions.

Important exclusion: the Baltic Sea and the Danish straits are not under NEAFC jurisdiction. That exclusion reflects historical and jurisdictional arrangements: those waters have been managed directly through EU mechanisms and bilateral/regional arrangements (including agreements involving the Russian Federation), rather than through NEAFC.

### Membership, governance and decision-making
- Contracting parties typically consist of coastal states and distant-water interests with operational fishing or management stakes in the Convention Area — for example, the European Union (acting on behalf of its member states), Norway, Iceland, the Russian Federation and Denmark (acting in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland). Following the UK’s exit from the EU (Brexit), the UK participates directly with NEAFC in its own right.
- Governance structure: NEAFC is governed by a Commission, supported by a Secretariat headed by an Executive Secretary. Scientific and compliance work is coordinated with external bodies (see below).
- Decision-making practice: as with many RFMOs, decisions are regularly taken by consensus among contracting parties, a process that shapes negotiation dynamics, the speed of measure-adoption and the character of compliance arrangements.

### Management, science and enforcement instruments
NEAFC’s standard toolkit mirrors that of contemporary RFMOs:
- Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and quota allocations where stock-specific management applies;
- Technical measures (gear restrictions, closed areas and seasons);
- Licensing systems and vessel authorisation;
- Vessel Monitoring Systems (VMS) and reporting requirements;
- At-sea and port inspection schemes and cooperative enforcement;
- IUU (Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated) vessel listings and blacklists.

Scientific advice relied upon by NEAFC chiefly comes from ICES (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea), whose stock assessments and ecosystem advice underpin TAC-setting and precautionary approaches.

### Jurisdictional complexity and political dynamics
NEAFC demonstrates several recurring features of multilateral maritime governance that are of analytical interest:
- Overlapping regimes and explicit carve-outs (e.g., Baltic Sea/Danish straits) testify to the layered character of ocean governance, where regional blocs (the EU), bilateral agreements and global law (UNCLOS) coexist.
- Geopolitical shifts — such as Brexit — have concrete operational effects. The UK’s change in status required renegotiation of access and quota arrangements and adjustment to commission participation and compliance mechanisms.
- Consensus decision-making can both enable cooperation and constrain ambitious conservation measures when parties’ interests diverge.

### Why NEAFC matters for India: strategic culture and national-security lessons
Although NEAFC governs a different ocean basin, several lessons are salient for Indian policy-makers and scholars concerned with India’s strategic culture and national-security policy:

1. Multilateral fisheries governance as security policy:
   - Fisheries governance intersects with food security, coastal livelihoods and economic security. Robust, enforceable multilateral regimes reduce conflict over shared stocks and the security risks associated with unregulated fishing.

2. Institutional design and enforcement:
   - NEAFC’s combination of TACs, VMS, licensing and cooperative inspections is a template for how states can combine technical, legal and surveillance measures to deter IUU fishing. India faces similar enforcement challenges in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and in the wider Indian Ocean Region (IOR).

3. Science-policy integration:
   - Reliance on independent scientific bodies (ICES for NEAFC) improves legitimacy and compliance. India’s engagement with scientific assessment mechanisms — including regional scientific bodies and data-sharing — strengthens decision-making credibility.

4. Managing overlapping jurisdictions:
   - The NEAFC example of carve-outs and bilateral arrangements parallels the Indian littoral’s mix of bilateral fishery agreements (e.g., with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar) and multilateral frameworks (IOTC, regional bodies). Clear delimitation and institutional coordination help reduce disputes.

5. Geopolitical contingency:
   - Brexit illustrates how political realignments alter multilateral governance. India’s strategic culture must anticipate how shifting alliances, economic partnerships and great-power competition affect cooperative regimes in the IOR.

6. Fisheries diplomacy:
   - Participation in RFMOs and regional fisheries arrangements serves diplomatic ends — building trust, enabling burden-sharing for enforcement and projecting norms of sustainable use. India can leverage fisheries diplomacy to expand influence and secure maritime interests.

### Sources, historiography and research needs
An editorial note on sourcing: existing descriptive accounts of NEAFC sometimes rely heavily on primary documents (conventions, Commission decisions). For scholarly work the article should be supplemented with secondary and tertiary sources. Recommended types of sources:
- Peer‑reviewed literature: journals such as Marine Policy, ICES Journal of Marine Science and Ocean & Coastal Management offer analyses of RFMO performance and enforcement.
- Institutional analyses and reports: FAO blue papers, assessments of RFMOs, NEAFC Annual Reports and Secretariat briefings.
- Scientific assessments: ICES stock assessment reports and advice documents.
- Policy studies: think‑tank and university research (e.g., Chatham House, SIPRI, ODI) that place RFMO governance in geopolitical context.
- Comparative books and edited volumes on ocean governance and RFMOs (academic presses).

Recommended immediate readings to integrate:
- FAO, “Regional Fisheries Management Organizations: An Overview” (annual or thematic reports).
- ICES stock assessments relevant to the northeast Atlantic.
- Selected articles in Marine Policy that evaluate NEAFC measures and enforcement outcomes.

### Concluding remarks
NEAFC offers a compact illustration of how states institutionalize cooperation over high-seas and straddling fish stocks: a legal convention, a secretariat, science-led advice, and a compliance toolkit. For India, the salient insight is not replication of NEAFC’s precise institutional form but the recognition that durable maritime security — understood to include resource security and enforcement capacity — depends upon credible multilateral institutions, sound science, interoperable surveillance and political will to implement collective measures.

### Chapter X — Contracting Parties to the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC): Structure, Representation and Lessons for Strategic Practice

This short case study examines the composition and legal character of the Contracting Parties to the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Though NEAFC governs a geographic region far from India, its institutional arrangements illustrate recurring strategic themes relevant to Indian national security and maritime policy: delegation of sovereign competences to multilateral bodies, representation of sub‑state jurisdictions in international fora, collective representation by supranational entities, and the operational consequences of changing domestic or international status. The following description is concise and analytical, drawing directly on the Commission’s membership and the legal/operational implications of that membership.

1. Contracting Parties — who they are and why it matters
- Denmark (in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland)
  - Denmark participates in NEAFC on behalf of its constituent parts that possess autonomous fisheries competence: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Although the Kingdom of Denmark is the formal Contracting Party, the entry explicitly reflects the distinct jurisdictional and management interests of those territories. This arrangement demonstrates how metropolitan states can simultaneously channel foreign policy while accommodating sub‑state autonomy in sectoral governance (here, fisheries).
- European Union
  - The EU is a single Contracting Party. Its participation reflects the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), under which its members have ceded certain fisheries competences to the Union. The EU acts and votes collectively in NEAFC on matters falling within its competence, a useful example of supranational representation in a resource‑management RFMO.
- Iceland
  - Iceland is an independent Contracting Party, exercising its own fisheries management, conservation measures and enforcement in the NEAFC area. Its role typifies small coastal states that combine territorial regulations with engagement in regional regimes to secure access and conservation.
- Norway
  - Norway participates as a Contracting Party with active roles in decision‑making, conservation measures and compliance. Given Norway’s maritime capacity and interests, its presence underscores the operational importance of coastal states in regional fisheries governance.
- Russian Federation
  - The Russian Federation is a Contracting Party, representing its national fishing interests and obligations in the Northeast Atlantic. Its engagement illustrates how major distant‑water fishing states integrate regional management commitments into broader strategic maritime activity.
- United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies
  - The United Kingdom is listed as a Contracting Party, and its entry explicitly covers Crown Dependencies (for example, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands), which the UK represents in international fisheries fora. This reflects practice whereby states represent dependencies that lack independent treaty capacity while preserving their particular legal and economic interests.

2. Institutional and legal features (operational implications)
- Meaning of “Contracting Party”
  - A Contracting Party is an entity—state or organization—legally bound by the NEAFC Convention and by decisions adopted under it. Parties have both privileges (participation in negotiations, access arrangements) and obligations (implementation of conservation measures, reporting, enforcement).
- RFMO mandate and scope
  - NEAFC is a regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) with competence over high seas areas and certain adjacent waters of the Northeast Atlantic. Its remit typically includes stock conservation, allocation of access, and measures to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.
- Core collaborative functions
  - Parties collaborate on: quota-setting and effort control; spatial management (area closures and marine protected zones); bycatch and ecosystem‑based mitigation; observer and electronic monitoring schemes; and monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) regimes to ensure compliance.
- Representation and devolved competence
  - Entries such as Denmark’s and the UK’s highlight how international representation often mirrors internal constitutional arrangements. Autonomous territories or dependencies with domestic competence in fisheries are represented by the metropolitan state, requiring internal coordination and, at times, differentiated implementation of international measures.
- Supranational representation (EU)
  - The EU’s membership demonstrates collective action through pooled competence. Non‑EU Contracting Parties operate and vote individually; where competence rests with the EU, member states are represented collectively—an arrangement that affects bargaining dynamics and coalition‑building within the RFMO.
- Rights and obligations
  - Contracting status confers rights (participation, negotiating access, proposing measures) and obligations (timely reporting, implementation of conservation measures, enforcement against nationals and vessels).
- Dynamics of status change
  - Domestic constitutional changes, devolution of competences, state succession, or accession/withdrawal from supranational organizations can alter who is listed as a Contracting Party. These dynamics create legal and operational complexities (e.g., transitional arrangements for implementation, re‑allocation of quota shares, or changes in enforcement responsibility).
- Non‑Contracting Parties and cooperating non‑Contracting Parties
  - Entities that are not full Contracting Parties, or are designated as cooperating non‑Contracting Parties, typically enjoy more limited privileges and are subject to different obligations—often constrained access, monitoring requirements, or conditional cooperation arrangements.

3. Strategic lessons and relevance to India
- Multilateral delegation and domestic coordination
  - NEAFC demonstrates how states delegate technical resource management to multilateral bodies while preserving strategic control over representation. For India, which participates in regional fisheries bodies and is crafting maritime governance mechanisms, the case underlines the need for robust interministerial coordination when the national state represents subnational or sectoral stakeholders abroad.
- Supranational and sub‑state representation
  - The EU and the Denmark/UK examples show two ends of the representation spectrum (supranational aggregation and metropolitan representation of autonomous territories). India’s own federal arrangements and external economic engagements suggest careful rules for who negotiates access and implements multilateral conservation commitments.
- Compliance and enforcement across jurisdictions
  - Effective RFMO governance rests on harmonized MCS, transparent reporting and cooperation—areas that overlap with national security concerns (maritime domain awareness, law enforcement capacity). NEAFC’s structure highlights that commitment on paper must be matched by operational enforcement to be credible.
- Adaptability to political change
  - The sensitivity of Contracting Party lists to constitutional or international status shifts is a reminder that India’s international commitments should be drafted with contingencies for domestic reforms, territory‑level changes and evolving institutional memberships.

Conclusion
The NEAFC membership profile—combining metropolitan representation of autonomous territories, supranational participation, and independent coastal states—encapsulates recurring institutional tradeoffs in maritime resource governance: representation, competence allocation, and enforcement. For policymakers and strategists studying India’s maritime posture, this compact example offers practical lessons about how legal form, domestic politics and institutional design intersect to shape both rights of access and obligations to conserve shared marine resources.

## Co‑operating Non‑Contracting Parties

Within regional fisheries management and other sectoral regimes, the category of “Co‑operating Non‑Contracting Party” (CNCP) performs a distinctive legal and operational role: it designates states that accept a degree of engagement with an organisation’s measures without becoming full contracting parties. Examining this status — here through the concrete example of CNCPs associated with the North‑East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) — illuminates how states use partial integration to extend governance, manage compliance risks, and protect maritime economic and security interests. The following discussion sets out the definition and effects of CNCP status, explains common reasons states adopt it, profiles three named CNCPs (Bahamas, Canada, Panama), and draws out practical implications and lessons relevant to strategic and security policymaking.

Definition and legal/operational effect
- Definition: A Co‑operating Non‑Contracting Party is a state that formally agrees to cooperate with an organisation’s conservation and management measures — for example, by providing data, accepting observer access, or applying certain enforcement measures to vessels flying its flag — while not enjoying full contracting‑party rights in decision‑making.
- Legal/operational effect: CNCPs typically accept limited obligations (e.g., reporting, compliance with specified measures, port access rules) but lack voting power. Their cooperation can be made subject to memoranda, working arrangements, or case‑by‑case acceptance of measures. This hybrid status extends the reach of rules beyond the membership while preserving sovereign choice about full accession.

Why states cooperate (typical motivations)
- Flag‑state interests: States with large ship registries or many flagged vessels seek arrangements that recognise and regulate activities of their fleets, thereby reducing conflict with regional managers.
- Port and landing interests: States whose ports or processing sectors receive catch from the area seek predictable regulatory regimes to facilitate trade and limit reputational or enforcement risks.
- Scientific collaboration: Sharing data and research supports stock assessments and sustainable harvests; cooperation grants access to collective scientific processes without full treaty commitments.
- Enforcement coordination: Cooperation enables information sharing, joint inspections and compliance mechanisms that reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.
- Pragmatic diplomacy: For some states, CNCP status offers a low‑cost diplomatic channel to influence practice, preserve options for later accession, or avoid political costs of full membership.

Profiles: Bahamas, Canada, Panama
- Bahamas — named as a Co‑operating Non‑Contracting Party: The Bahamas’ designation indicates formal engagement with NEAFC activities while stopping short of full contracting membership. Given the Bahamas’ role as a registry and maritime services provider, cooperation likely aims to ensure flagged vessels comply with NEAFC measures and to safeguard port/processing interactions.
- Canada — listed as a Co‑operating Non‑Contracting Party: Canada is a major North Atlantic fishing state. Its cooperation is notable because it implies substantive engagement in management, compliance, and data‑sharing with NEAFC even without contracting‑party status. This arrangement can reflect geopolitical and jurisdictional considerations (e.g., continental shelf, EEZ interfaces) while preserving bilateral or multilateral policy options.
- Panama — identified as a Co‑operating Non‑Contracting Party: Panama’s participation frequently reflects registry/flag‑of‑convenience dynamics. Cooperation extends NEAFC measures to vessels registered under Panamanian flags and may include commitments on inspections, certification and port state controls aimed at reducing IUU risks.

Practical implications for governance and security
- Extending enforcement to the high seas: CNCP arrangements materially improve the enforceability of regional measures by bringing non‑members into compliance frameworks, thereby reducing gaps that IUU actors exploit.
- Information flow and science: Data‑sharing and observer access from CNCPs strengthen stock assessments and management advice, producing better conservation outcomes than a regime confined to contracting parties alone.
- Addressing registry and port vulnerabilities: Cooperation by registry/provision states (e.g., Panama, Bahamas) mitigates the “loophole” effect of flags or ports that otherwise enable non‑compliant actors to evade regulation.
- Limits and risks: CNCP status does not substitute for full legal commitment; cooperative obligations can be narrow or revocable, and lack of voting rights limits influence on rule‑making. States or vessels may comply only to the extent the cooperating arrangement specifies.

Relevance and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic utility of graduated engagement: CNCP models illustrate how India can design calibrated engagements with regional regimes — combining data‑sharing, observer programmes and targeted enforcement cooperation — without immediate full accession, thereby preserving policy flexibility while enhancing maritime governance.
- Flag and port governance as security tools: India’s interests in combating IUU fishing, protecting maritime resources and securing sea lines of communication can be advanced by bolstering registry standards and port state controls, and by pressing for cooperation from registry states whose vessels operate in regions of interest.
- Intelligence and compliance architecture: The CNCP model underscores the value of interoperability in monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) systems — a priority for India as it builds capacity across the Indian Ocean region and in partnerships with regional organisations.
- Diplomatic pathways: For India’s external‑policy practice, CNCP‑style arrangements offer a lower‑threshold modality for entering multilateral regimes, testing commitments, and incrementally building leadership and influence.

Suggested verification
- Confirm the precise scope and legal basis of each CNCP’s cooperation in NEAFC documentation (e.g., memoranda of understanding, formal notifications, minutes of meetings) to determine whether obligations are substantive, conditional or limited to specific activities (observer access, data reporting, port controls).

This case of CNCPs in the NEAFC system therefore demonstrates a pragmatic tool in international governance — one that balances sovereign autonomy with the collective need to manage shared maritime resources. For policymakers focused on strategic culture and national security, the model offers concrete approaches to expand regulatory reach, strengthen compliance, and pursue layered engagement when full treaty accession is not immediately feasible.
