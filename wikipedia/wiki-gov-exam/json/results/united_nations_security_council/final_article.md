# Introduction — The United Nations Security Council

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the six principal organs created by the UN Charter and stands at the center of the UN system’s mandate to preserve international peace and security. Its legal authority, special powers and unique composition make it the principal actor through which collective measures — from diplomatic pressure to armed enforcement — are legitimized at the global level. Understanding the Council’s design, practice and pathologies is essential for any study of national security policy and strategic culture, including India’s evolving engagement with multilateral order.

## Mandate and legal basis
- The Security Council’s primary responsibility is ensuring international peace and security. Article 24 of the UN Charter entrusts the Council with this “primary responsibility,” and Article 25 obliges Member States to accept and carry out Council decisions.
- The Council’s enforcement powers derive from Chapter VII of the Charter, which authorizes measures ranging from non‑military sanctions to the use of force.
- Unlike other UN organs, the UNSC can adopt resolutions that are legally binding on all Member States (subject to the Charter’s limits).

## Origins and early history
- The Council was designed in the aftermath of World War II to correct perceived shortcomings of the League of Nations: to create a mechanism for collective security that combined legitimacy with the capacity for enforcement.
- The first Security Council session convened on 17 January 1946.
- The Council’s permanent membership — China, France, Russia (as successor to the USSR), the United Kingdom and the United States — reflects the geopolitical realities and victors of the Second World War and the architects of the Charter.

## Composition, rotation and voting rules
- The Council comprises 15 members: five permanent members (P5) and ten non‑permanent members elected for two‑year terms.
- Non‑permanent seats are allocated regionally and filled by election in the General Assembly.
- The presidency of the Council rotates monthly among all members in English alphabetical order.
- Substantive resolutions generally require at least nine affirmative votes and no veto by any permanent member to pass. The veto is a decisive institutional tool: any P5 member can block substantive Council action.
- The veto applies only to substantive matters; procedural matters cannot be vetoed.

## Powers and tools
- Charter‑granted instruments include:
  - Creating and mandating peacekeeping operations (traditionally under Chapter VI or Chapter VII mandates).
  - Imposing sanctions regimes.
  - Authorizing collective military action.
  - Referring situations to international criminal tribunals (for example, referrals to the International Criminal Court or establishing ad hoc tribunals).
- Security Council resolutions gain legal force through the Charter; Chapter VII provides the primary legal pathway for enforcement measures.

## Peacekeeping: practice and financing
- Although not created by the Charter per se, UN peacekeeping emerged as a Council practice to manage conflicts and provide interposition, monitoring and support to political processes.
- Peacekeeping forces are contributed voluntarily by Member States; they are not UN regular forces. Troop, police and civilian contributions are pledged by national governments.
- Peacekeeping operations are financed through a separate UN peacekeeping budget distinct from the regular UN budget.
- As of November 2021 (source figures), the UN had 12 peacekeeping missions, roughly 87,000 personnel contributed by 121 countries and an annual peacekeeping budget of about $6.3 billion; these figures change over time and should be updated in current work.

## Historical dynamics: Cold War paralysis and post‑Cold War activism
- During the Cold War the Council was frequently paralyzed by US–Soviet rivalry; the veto was used often and blocked collective action on many major crises.
- Despite this paralysis, the UNSC did authorize notable exceptions: military intervention in the Korean War (1950), and Council‑mandated responses in the Congo Crisis; it also authorized early peacekeeping deployments in locations such as Cyprus, West New Guinea and the Sinai.
- The collapse of the Soviet Union opened a period of greater UNSC activism and an expansion of peacekeeping in the 1990s, producing major operations and authorizations concerning Kuwait, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

## Criticisms and reform debates
- Persistent critiques of the Council center on:
  - The concentration of veto power in five states that reflect the mid‑20th century power distribution rather than contemporary geopolitics.
  - Under‑representation of regions — especially Africa — in permanent seats.
  - Calls for enlargement and more representative permanent membership (for example, the G4 claimants: India, Germany, Japan and Brazil).
  - Questions of accountability and performance in peacekeeping, including mandate clarity, civilian protection, and misconduct by personnel.
- Reform proposals range from modest procedural changes to substantive enlargement of permanent seats and curbs on veto use; none have so far produced consensus in the General Assembly or among the P5.

## Enforcement thresholds and international justice
- The Council can act under Chapter VI (pacific settlement of disputes) or Chapter VII (enforcement measures). Chapter VII is the Charter basis for binding coercive measures.
- The Council may refer situations to international criminal bodies or create ad‑hoc tribunals; it can also impose targeted sanctions or authorize robust mandates that include protection of civilians and the use of force.

## Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- The UNSC is central to India’s external strategic calculations. India has long sought a permanent seat to align multilateral governance with contemporary power realities and to secure regional representation (particularly for Asia).
- India’s international standing is also shaped by its sustained contributions to UN peacekeeping operations — a practical source of diplomatic capital and a reflection of its strategic preference for multilateral legitimacy.
- The veto power and the P5 dynamics impose important constraints on India’s crisis management options when great‑power interests are engaged, reinforcing New Delhi’s interest in Council reform and in building coalitions within the Assembly and among non‑permanent members.
- Debates over UN reform, accountability in peacekeeping, and the legal reach of Chapter VII intersect directly with India’s priorities for sovereignty, non‑intervention and collective action against threats to international peace.

## Key terms
- Principal organ: One of the main bodies established by the UN Charter (e.g., Security Council, General Assembly).
- Binding resolutions: Security Council decisions that Member States are obliged under the Charter to implement.
- Veto: The power of any permanent member to block substantive Council action.
- Peacekeeping: The deployment of military, police and civilian personnel to support cessation of hostilities, monitoring and political processes; contributions are voluntary from Member States.
- Chapter VII: The Charter provisions authorizing enforcement measures, including sanctions and the use of force.

Note: Factual figures cited here (peacekeeping mission counts, personnel, budgets) reflect the source data as of November 2021; researchers should update operational statistics and mission inventories when using this chapter for empirical analysis.

### 2.1 From Hague Conventions to the United Nations: Institutional Continuities and Lessons for India

This section traces the institutional lineage from 19th‑ and early 20th‑century treaty conferences through the League of Nations and the wartime planning that produced the United Nations. It highlights the legal and organisational precedents that shaped the UN, the political compromises (especially over the Security Council and the veto), and the practical lessons these developments held for newly independent and colonial peoples — a group to which India’s strategic culture has been especially responsive.

1. Early foundations: treaty organisations and humanitarian models
- The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw states create rule‑based instruments to regulate interstate violence and commerce. The Hague Conventions (1899, 1907) codified laws of war and arbitration mechanisms that anticipated later multilateral legal architecture. These conventions established procedures, norms and neutral forums for dispute resolution that would inform later UN law and practice.
- The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC; founded 1863) modelled a neutral, humanitarian international actor distinct from governments. Its principles — neutrality, impartiality, humanitarian law — became templates for later UN agencies and for India’s own recurrent emphasis on humanitarian and legal norms in international fora.
- Specialist, technical solutions to global problems (postal systems, civil aviation, opium control) were addressed through international technical agencies and conferences; these functionalist precedents later migrated into the UN system as specialised agencies or inspired their creation (for example, the Universal Postal Union and the later ICAO).

2. The League of Nations: promise, achievements, and structural weaknesses
- After World War I the Paris Peace Conference created the League of Nations with the explicit aim of preserving international peace. The League achieved practical successes: resolving some territorial disputes, and creating international frameworks in postal services, civil aviation and drug/opium control. Many League technical agencies provided institutional continuity into the UN era.
- Yet the League displayed critical structural weaknesses: its membership and decision‑making excluded and marginalised roughly half the world — colonial peoples had no meaningful representation — and several major powers were absent or intermittently engaged. The United States never joined, the Soviet Union was excluded until the 1930s, and Germany and Japan were at times outside the system. These absences eroded both legitimacy and enforcement capacity.
- The League’s inability to deter or check aggressive revisionism in the 1930s — Japan’s invasion of Manchuria (1931), Italy’s conquest of Ethiopia (1935), the 1937 escalation in China, and Nazi Germany’s expansion — demonstrated the limits of collective security without the effective participation of major powers. These failures shaped postwar resolve to design a mechanism that could secure the engagement of great powers while embedding legal procedures for peace — but they also left an enduring wariness about great‑power privilege and exclusion among colonised and neutral states, including India.

3. Wartime diplomacy and the genesis of the UN
- Allied wartime conferences progressively sketch‑mapped a postwar multilateral order. The Cairo Conference (1943) and later Tehran and Moscow sessions refined understandings among major Allied leaders on postwar territorial and institutional arrangements. By January 1, 1942, the “United Nations” Declaration — signed initially by Roosevelt, Churchill, Soviet representative Maxim Litvinov (later Molotov’s delegation) and T. V. Soong of the Republic of China — formalised the wartime alliance in political terms. This Declaration drew on earlier commitments (the Atlantic Charter, the London Declaration) and emphasised cooperation against aggression.
- The Declaration’s signatory list expanded quickly: 22 nations signed on 2 January 1942; the label “United Nations” became official once 26 governments had signed. By March 1, 1945, another 21 states had acceded. The concept of the “Four Powers” (United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Republic of China) emerged as a practical nucleus for managing grand strategy and postwar architecture and became the pivot around which negotiations for the UN’s executive functions turned.

4. Dumbarton Oaks, Yalta and the core institutional bargains
- By mid‑1944 the great‑power delegations converged at Dumbarton Oaks (Washington, D.C.) to produce concrete proposals for a postwar organisation. Dumbarton Oaks set the structural baseline: a general assembly, a security body, and specialised agencies. The composition of the Security Council emerged as the central political problem.
- Dumbarton Oaks proposed five permanent members: United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, Republic of China and France. France’s inclusion reflected Allied politics and a desire to restore an important European power to the council despite France not being part of the original “Four Powers.” The United States briefly sought to add a sixth permanent member (Brazil); that proposal foundered on opposition, especially from the Soviet and British delegations.
- The question of veto power was fiercely contested. The Soviet position initially sought an absolute veto that would prevent even discussion of certain matters; the British delegation opposed an unlimited veto for matters involving the vetoing party. The Yalta Conference (February 1945) brokered a crucial compromise: the Big Five would possess veto power over substantive council actions, but could not use it to close off procedural discussion — a device intended to allow issues to be aired even if action was blocked. This compromise institutionalised great‑power concurrence as the price of the Council’s legitimacy.

5. San Francisco, Evatt’s challenge, and the Charter’s adoption
- The UN Conference on International Organization opened at San Francisco on 25 April 1945. Fifty governments, along with selected non‑governmental organisations, negotiated and drafted the UN Charter on the Dumbarton Oaks foundations but with intense debates over wording and procedures.
- Australia’s H. V. Evatt (a vigorous advocate of smaller‑power rights) championed proposals to limit the scope of permanent members’ vetoes. Evatt’s attempt to further restrict veto power at San Francisco was decisively defeated (20 to 10), reflecting fears that persistent disagreement over the veto could scuttle the conference and, thereby, deny the creation of the organisation itself.
- The Charter was adopted and thereafter ratified by the five permanent Security Council members and a majority of the other signatories. The UN came into legal existence on 24 October 1945 — a date now commemorated globally as UN Day.

6. Early operations: the Security Council and the first years
- The Security Council convened for the first time on 17 January 1946 at Church House, Westminster, London. From 1946 to 1951 many council sessions were held at the UN’s interim headquarters in Lake Success, New York; in 1949 some sessions were even televised live in the United States (CBS journalist Edmund Chester covered live broadcasts), testimony to the new organisation’s public visibility.
- Dumbarton Oaks’ structural blueprint, modified at Yalta and San Francisco, established the UN’s core institutional arrangement: a General Assembly representing universality and a Security Council empowered to maintain international peace and security, with permanent membership and veto designed to secure the participation of major powers. This bargain created both the UN’s capacity (through great‑power engagement) and a persistent fault line (through veto privilege).

7. Institutional legacies and continuing controversies
- Several technical and functional mechanisms initiated in the League era transitioned into the UN system or inspired its specialised agencies (postal, civil aviation, drug control). The Hague Conventions and the ICRC left legal and normative legacies that encouraged a law‑based approach to armed conflict and humanitarian protection.
- The League’s earlier mistakes — marginalising colonial peoples and failing to secure major‑power participation — informed the UN’s dual emphasis on universality and major‑power consent. Yet the resulting institutional compromise embedded enduring tensions: the exclusive privileges of permanent membership, the veto, and the political dominance of great powers have led to repeated paralysis (notably during the Cold War) and long‑standing demands for Security Council reform.
- The composition of permanent membership has itself been historically dynamic: the Republic of China originally occupied China’s seat, but in 1971 the People’s Republic of China assumed the seat following General Assembly Resolution 2758. This change highlights that seats of privilege in the UN are subject to broader geopolitical shifts.
- The veto remains the central constitutional controversy of the UN. It has been used repeatedly to block Council action, especially in the Cold War era, and its presence continues to shape the behaviour of both great and middle powers.

8. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s experience of colonialism and its formative encounters with international institutions informed a strategic culture that prizes legal norms, universality, and principled multilateral engagement. The exclusion of colonial peoples from the League helped shape India’s early diplomatic objectives: championing decolonisation, demanding equal representation, and insisting that great‑power arrangements not entrench permanent hierarchies.
- India was an original participant in the San Francisco negotiations and became a founding member of the United Nations in 1945. India used the UN early on to pursue its security interests — most notably bringing the Kashmir dispute before the Security Council in 1948 — and subsequently developed a reputation for robust participation in UN peacekeeping operations, which has reinforced norms of multilateral crisis management in its strategic practice.
- The structural bargains that produced the Security Council — permanent seats, veto privileges, and the emphasis on great‑power concurrence — have been central to India’s long‑term policy goals. New Delhi has consistently argued for Security Council expansion to include India as a permanent member and has called for either limitations on veto use or its more responsible application. India’s advocacy reflects both normative commitments (equitable representation, decolonisation) and practical imperatives (securing influence commensurate with power and responsibility).
- Finally, the dual legacy of continuity and compromise — functional agencies and humanitarian law from the 19th/20th centuries, alongside political arrangements that privilege great powers — remains instructive for Indian policy makers. India’s strategic culture balances a preference for legal‑institutional solutions with a pragmatic recognition that major‑power politics and institutional design both enable and constrain national security outcomes. The UN’s history thus serves as both model and caution: a reminder that institutions matter, but that their effectiveness depends on inclusivity, legitimacy and the political will of powerful states.

Concluding note
The UN’s institutional architecture grew from technical precedents (Hague Conventions, ICRC), through the League’s mixed legacy, to wartime bargains at Dumbarton Oaks and Yalta and final codification at San Francisco. For India, these developments clarified the importance of universality, legalism and the pursuit of institutional reform — enduring themes in its strategic culture and national security policy.

## The Security Council in the Cold War: Constraints, Selective Action and Consequences for India’s Strategic Outlook

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) was born into a world already dividing into rival blocs. Its early institutional life — beginning with the first meeting at Church House, London, on 17 January 1946 — was therefore shaped as much by the Charter’s text as by superpower politics. The Cold War left a durable imprint on how the Council could (and could not) respond to threats to international peace and security; these patterns in turn informed the strategic calculations of newly independent states such as India. This section synthesizes the key episodes and institutional dynamics of the Council’s Cold War record and draws out the implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Structural constraint: the P5 veto and paralysis
- The permanent five (P5) — United States, the Soviet Union (now Russia), United Kingdom, France and China — possess veto power in the UNSC. During the Cold War this veto was the fundamental structural reason the Council was often paralysed.
- Where P5 consensus was absent, the Council could not authoritatively deploy collective security measures, leading to an uneven record of engagement. Major superpower crises—where one or more P5 had direct stakes—were frequently handled outside the Council by direct diplomacy between capitals.

2. Selective intervention: when Council action was possible
- Korea (1950): In an exceptional set of circumstances the Council authorized a US-led military coalition to repel North Korea’s invasion of South Korea. The Soviet Union was absent from the Chamber in protest over the China seat dispute; that absence removed the veto and allowed the resolution to pass. This episode demonstrates how procedural and political contingencies could permit decisive Council action despite underlying rivalry.
- Suez (1956): The Council facilitated a novel instrument of multilateral conflict management when it established the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to supervise withdrawal and separation of forces after the Suez Crisis. UNEF was the first large-scale example of what later became known as UN peacekeeping — a flexible, consent-based tool that could be used even when Chapter VII enforcement was politically unavailable.
- Congo (1960–1964): The United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC, later ONUC) became the largest UN military force of the organization’s early decades. Under Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld and an active Secretariat, ONUC intervened to restore central government authority in Katanga; by 1964 Katanga had been returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Congo operation exemplified the Secretariat’s operational initiative in using peacekeeping and coercive measures in a highly volatile setting.
- Other missions: The UN also undertook operations in West New Guinea (UN Temporary Executive Authority, 1962) and established the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP, 1964). UNFICYP in particular became one of the longest-running missions and a template for prolonged containment and buffer-zone operations.

3. Limits and failures: where the UN could not act
- Hungary (1956): Simultaneous with the Suez deployment, the UN was effectively powerless to intervene against the Soviet military suppression of the Hungarian Revolution. Soviet dominance over its Eastern European sphere and the need for P5 agreement meant the UN lacked the capacity to act in the face of great-power enforcement.
- Larger superpower crises: In confrontations such as the Cuban Missile Crisis or protracted conflicts like the Vietnam War, the UNSC was largely bypassed in favour of direct American–Soviet negotiations or unilateral action. The Council’s inability to function as an arbiter in these cases underlined its dependence on great-power concurrence.
- Military Staff Committee: Articles 45–47 of the UN Charter envisaged a Military Staff Committee to plan the use of UN forces and facilities. Cold War divisions rendered the Committee ineffective; by the mid-1950s it existed largely on paper, and no standing UN military command or global UN bases as originally envisaged were developed.

4. Institutional and political shifts: Third World influence and agenda change
- China’s seat (1971): On 25 October 1971, the People’s Republic of China replaced the Republic of China (Taiwan) as the UN member occupying China’s seat in the Security Council (General Assembly Resolution 2758). The vote, achieved over US opposition and with broad support from newly independent Third World states and Albania, was interpreted widely as evidence of declining unilateral US influence within the UN system.
- Rise of the Third World and Non-Aligned Movement: As decolonization accelerated and Newly Independent States entered the UN in large numbers, the Organisation’s political centre of gravity shifted. These states prioritized decolonization, economic development and cultural cooperation; their growing presence reshaped UN deliberations and voting patterns.
- Budgetary and programmatic shift: By the 1970s the UN devoted more of its budget to social and economic development than to peacekeeping. This signalled a broadened UN agenda that went beyond the narrow peace-and-security tasks traditionally perceived as the Council’s domain.

5. Enduring precedents and lessons
- When P5 consensus is present, the Security Council can authorize robust collective action; when it is absent, the UN disproportionately relies on alternative tools: peacekeeping (consent-based), mediation, political missions, and multilateral development programs.
- Cold War innovations — particularly peacekeeping, the use of prolonged, multi-year missions, and the Secretariat’s activist role — became institutional precedents that shaped UN operations after the Cold War.
- The Military Staff Committee’s failure illustrated the limits of Charter-based military integration when major-power politics are adversarial.

6. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Multilateralism tempered by realism: The Cold War record reinforced in Indian strategic thinking a pragmatic multilateralism — a preference for using international organizations and law as instruments of legitimacy and collective action, coupled with scepticism about the expectation that the UN will always be able to compel great-power behaviour.
- Embrace of peacekeeping as normative and practical tool: India emerged as one of the most consistent contributors to UN peacekeeping, seeing such missions as a means to project its role as a responsible major power, to gain operational experience for its armed forces, and to promote norms of sovereignty and non-intervention while supporting containment and stabilisation.
- Non-Alignment and Third World solidarity: The shift in UN politics toward decolonization and development resonated with India’s leadership in the Non-Aligned Movement and its advocacy for a New International Economic Order. India's support for Third World priorities in the UN reflected both normative commitments and strategic aims to leverage collective influence against unilateral great-power dominance.
- UNSC reform and long-term ambitions: The demonstrated centrality of the P5 and the political blockage produced by vetoes underlined for India the institutional limits of the UNSC and fed long-standing Indian aspirations for reform — including a permanent seat — as a corrective to great-power monopolization of security decision-making.
- Doctrinal caution about unilateral enforcement: Episodes such as Hungary and Vietnam reinforced a caution within Indian policy about relying on external guarantees; they contributed to an emphasis on building national strategic autonomy and diversified diplomatic engagement, including South–South cooperation.

Conclusion
The Cold War constrained the Security Council’s capacity to be a uniform instrument of collective security, but it also produced inventive practices — notably modern peacekeeping and politicized Secretariat leadership — that became central to the UN’s post–Cold War utility. For India, these patterns validated a dual approach: active engagement with multilateral institutions (including major contributions to peacekeeping and leadership in Third World coalitions) while remaining cautious about the Council’s capacity to constrain great powers and pressing the case for institutional reform. The Cold War’s institutional lessons continue to inform India’s strategic culture: an insistence on multilateral legitimacy, a preference for politically creative instruments short of force when great-power consensus is absent, and a sustained campaign for a more representative Security Council.

### The United Nations Security Council in the Post–Cold War Era

The end of the Cold War transformed both international security dynamics and the practical role of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). For India—whose strategic culture balances principled multilateralism, insistence on sovereignty, active peacekeeping contributions, and a distinctive nuclear posture—this period offered both opportunities and stark lessons about the limits of international organization. The following section synthesizes the trajectory of the UNSC and UN peace operations after 1990, highlights emblematic successes and failures, and draws out implications that are especially pertinent for Indian national security thinking.

1. Expansion of UN peacekeeping: scale and speed
- The early 1990s witnessed a dramatic quantitative expansion of UN peace operations. In a single decade the UN launched more missions than in the previous four decades combined. Between 1988 and 2000 the Security Council’s adopted resolutions more than doubled, and the peacekeeping budget rose by over an order of magnitude.
- This surge reflected two related facts: (a) a proliferation of intrastate crises as the international system shifted away from superpower rivalry; and (b) high political expectations that the UN could manage those crises. India, already a major contributor of personnel to UN peace operations, confronted a higher operational tempo and greater demand for troop- and police-contributions.

2. Early successes—and the “false renaissance”
- Several high-profile UN undertakings in the immediate post–Cold War period were widely regarded as successes: negotiated settlements or UN-managed transitions in El Salvador; the well-executed mission in Namibia; supervised elections in post-apartheid South Africa and in Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge era. The UNSC also acted quickly in inter-state aggression: in 1991 it condemned Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and authorized a US-led coalition to restore Kuwaiti sovereignty.
- Nonetheless, veteran UN officials such as Under-Secretary-General Brian Urquhart cautioned that this apparent renaissance was fragile and selective. Early successes did not mean the UN had the institutional capacity, doctrine, or political consensus to address the more intractable internal conflicts that followed.

3. Structural and doctrinal limits: charter design vs. internal wars
- The UN Charter was principally oriented toward preventing and managing inter-state aggression; its peacekeeping principles—consent of the parties, impartiality, and non-use of force except in self‑defence—were rooted in that focus. Those constraints proved ill-suited to civil wars, intra‑state collapse, and genocidal campaigns in which there was no effective sovereign consent or where belligerents intentionally targeted civilians.
- The distinction between Chapter VI (peaceful settlement, typically requiring consent and limiting force) and Chapter VII (enforcement measures, permitting more robust action) became central. Mandate design—whether peacekeeping was Chapter VI-style or a Chapter VII enforcement operation—determined the robustness and rules of engagement, with profound operational consequences.

4. High-profile failures and politicized paralysis
- Bosnia: the UN presence in the former Yugoslavia was widely criticized for indecisiveness and failure to prevent ethnic cleansing; limitations of mandate and political divisions among Council members constrained decisive action.
- Rwanda 1994: United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) failed to prevent or halt genocide amid Security Council indecision and restrictive troop mandates. The crisis exposed how political hesitation and the P5’s dynamics could paralyze the Council, with catastrophic human costs.
- Sri Lanka (2009): an internal UN review judged the organization’s conduct during the final battles of the Sri Lankan Civil War to be a “systemic failure,” underscoring ongoing problems in protecting civilians and coordinating action in densely political conflict environments.

5. Evolving practice: interventions, coalitions, and UN authorization
- In the late 1990s and 2000s interventions became more varied in form. Some operations blended UN authorization with external military capacities: Sierra Leone’s stabilization benefited significantly from British Royal Marines supplementing UN efforts; the 2001 intervention in Afghanistan was conducted under NATO’s leadership with UN authorization; by contrast, the 2003 US‑led invasion of Iraq proceeded without Security Council authorization, raising profound questions about the UNSC’s authority and legitimacy.
- The Colin Powell presentation to the Security Council in February 2003—when the US Secretary of State displayed a model anthrax vial—illustrates how states can use the Council as a stage to mobilize international support for national policies, whether or not the Council ultimately endorses those policies.

6. Proliferation, arms control, and the Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT) context
- All UNSC members are parties to the NPT, and the five permanent members are the treaty’s recognized nuclear-weapon states. Debates about nuclear status and regional proliferation—sharpened in the post‑Cold War era by conflicts in the Middle East and concerns over Iran—have repeatedly intersected with Security Council politics.
- Egypt’s late‑2014 proposal to broaden the scope of the NPT debate (invoking Israeli and Iranian issues in the context of Middle East hostilities linked to Syria) illustrates how regional rivalries and the UNSC agenda interact. For India—outside the NPT and a declared nuclear-armed state—these dynamics reinforce both the limits of treaty-based status hierarchies and the enduring importance of regional security imperatives.

7. Operational strain and institutional shortcomings
- Rapid expansion exposed systemic problems: inadequate logistics, weak rapid‑reaction capabilities, gaps in intelligence and situational awareness, overstretched budgets, and uneven clarity in mandates. The mismatch between political expectations and operational capacity repeatedly produced ineffective missions or unintended consequences.
- The combination of limited resources and politically constrained mandates encouraged experimentation with mandates that blurred peacekeeping, peacemaking, and stabilization tasks—often without the concomitant legal, logistical, or strategic clarity.

8. Political constraints: P5 dynamics and legitimacy concerns
- Security Council politics—especially the veto power of the five permanent members—frequently constrained timely, forceful responses. Rwanda and Bosnia are recurrent examples where vetoes, abstentions, or political sensitivity inhibited robust engagement.
- Unilateral or coalition actions taken without UNSC authorization (Iraq 2003 foremost among them) have had a lasting effect on perceptions of UN authority. Such actions erode the Council’s normative centrality and complicate multilateral problem‑solving, even when the actors concerned are major powers with significant security interests.

9. Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- Commitment to multilateralism vs. realism: India’s enduring preference for multilateral frameworks is tempered by the post‑Cold War record; the limits and politicization of the UNSC reinforce India’s push for UNSC reform and a permanent Council seat commensurate with its contributions and interests.
- Peacekeeping and operational lessons: India’s substantial troop contributions and operational experience in UN missions inform its appreciation for clear mandates, adequate logistics, and realistic tasks—lessons it has internalized in national force planning and doctrine.
- Nuclear posture and normative positioning: India’s non‑NPT status and demand for regional equity (e.g., concerns about unequal frameworks that recognize only five nuclear weapon states) are reinforced by post‑Cold War debates in which NPT dynamics and UNSC politics overlap.
- Coalition diplomacy and selective multilateralism: The period demonstrates why India combines multilateral engagement with flexible coalitions and bilateral security relationships. When the UNSC proves gridlocked or politically partial, India has shown a tendency to pursue strategic objectives through other means, while continuing to advocate for stronger, more representative global governance.

Conclusion — tensions and enduring challenges
The post‑Cold War expansion of UN peace operations produced both notable successes and spectacular failures. Those outcomes revealed a core tension: the UN Charter and traditional peacekeeping principles were designed for inter‑state disputes but were called upon to manage intra‑state violence, genocides, and complex political transitions. Political contestation within the Security Council, operational shortcomings, and evolving doctrines (including humanitarian intervention and the later adoption of the Responsibility to Protect in 2005) reshaped the practice of collective security but did not resolve deeper legitimacy and capability questions. For India, these developments affirmed the value of principled multilateralism while underscoring the need for pragmatic reform, improved operational capacity, and strategic autonomy when global governance fails to deliver timely or equitable outcomes.

## United Nations Security Council — Role

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) occupies a central place in the institutional architecture of international collective security. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the Council is both a normative forum — where legal rules and political standards are declared — and a practical arena where the balance of power among major states is exercised, constrained, or contested. The following section synthesizes the Council’s formal powers under the UN Charter, its working practice, and key intersections with issues that matter for Indian strategy: enforcement, the limits imposed by the permanent five (P5), the Council’s relationship with international criminal justice and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P), and the research resources scholars use to trace its evolving practice.

Composition and veto power
- Membership: The Council has 15 members: five permanent (P5) members — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States — and ten non‑permanent members elected by the General Assembly for two‑year terms.
- Veto: Each P5 member possesses a veto over substantive Council decisions. The veto is the single most important structural constraint on Council action and shapes both what the Council can accomplish and how states (including India) frame their diplomacy. Lists of vetoes and analyses of the “power of veto” are standard reference points when assessing Council effectiveness.

Charter powers and institutional functions
- Charter basis: The UN Charter vests the Security Council with primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. Its authorities span preventive, remedial and coercive measures.
- Core powers (summary):
  - Investigate any dispute or situation that might lead to international friction.
  - Recommend procedures for pacific settlement of disputes.
  - Call upon member states to suspend or sever economic relations and communications (including sea, air, postal, and radio links) or to break diplomatic relations.
  - Authorize enforcement measures, including the use of armed force, to maintain or restore international peace and security (“by any means necessary” in practice under Chapter VII mandates).
  - Recommend candidates for Secretary‑General and new members for admission to the United Nations.
- Institutional limits: The Council has no standing military force; enforcement depends on member‑states’ willingness and capacity to implement Council mandates.

Chapters VI and VII — legal character and practice
- Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement of Disputes):
  - Authorizes the Council to investigate disputes and to recommend “appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment.”
  - Recommendations under Chapter VI are traditionally viewed as non‑binding because they lack coercive enforcement mechanisms.
  - Minority scholarly views (e.g., Stephen Zunes and others) argue that Chapter VI resolutions can functionally act as directives in certain political contexts, the distinction being the availability of strong enforcement tools rather than legal force per se.
- Chapter VII (Action with respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression):
  - Grants the Council broader powers to determine threats to peace and to take binding measures — economic sanctions, embargoes, and, if necessary, collective military action — to “maintain or restore international peace and security.”
  - Examples of Chapter VII‑based interventions include:
    - Korea (1950) — UN military action authorized in response to the North Korean invasion;
    - Coalition action in Iraq/Kuwait (1991) — Chapter VII authorization for use of force to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait;
    - Libya (2011) — authorization of measures to protect civilians, which ultimately encompassed the military campaign against Gaddafi’s forces.
  - Decisions adopted under Chapter VII are legally binding on UN member states.

Resolution practice, topics and cataloguing
- Resolution catalogue: The Council’s jurisprudence and precedent are traced through its resolutions. Researchers commonly work from organized catalogs and numeric ranges; for instance, cataloging often groups Security Council resolutions as 1–1000, 1001–2000, 2001–3000 etc., with subranges that map roughly onto historical periods (e.g., 001–0100: 1946–1953; 2701–2800: 2023–present).
- Topic clusters: Many resolutions recur around geographic and thematic issues. Frequent Council topics include: Cyprus; Iran; Iraq; Israel; Lebanon; Nagorno‑Karabakh; North Korea; Palestine; Syria; Western Sahara; Yemen; and the conflicts of the former Yugoslavia.
- Tracking practice: Systematic tracking of resolutions by numeric ranges, year spans and subject matter is essential for tracing legal precedents and the Council’s evolving policy practice. Key public resources include UNBISnet (official UN documentation/cataloguing) and primary‑text repositories such as Wikisource.

Vetoes, constraints and political dynamics
- The P5 veto power means that political alignment among major powers — not legal correctness — often determines whether the Council can act. This dynamic affects the Council’s capacity to respond to crises (for example, in Syria) and conditions how states like India calibrate their diplomacy.
- Even where the Council adopts measures, implementation rests on member states’ political will and resources; the UN lacks an independent coercive instrument.

Interaction with the ICC and the Responsibility to Protect (R2P)
- ICC referrals: The Security Council enjoys a unique competence to refer situations to the International Criminal Court (ICC) under the Rome Statute, extending the ICC’s reach to situations in states that are not parties to the Statute.
  - Notable referrals: Darfur (Sudan) — March 2005 — the Court’s jurisdiction was activated despite Sudan not being a party; Libya — February 2011 — the Council requested the ICC to investigate crimes arising from the Libyan Civil War.
- Responsibility to Protect:
  - The Council has incorporated R2P‑related commitments into its practice. Resolution 1674 (28 April 2006) reaffirmed the Council’s responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity, reflecting language from the 2005 World Summit outcome.
  - Resolution 1706 (31 August 2006) reiterated the Council’s commitment to protecting civilians in armed conflict.
  - R2P remains politically sensitive: authorization of coercive measures in the name of civilian protection is typically linked to Chapter VII, and P5 political divisions make consistent R2P application uneven.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic positioning: As a non‑permanent member on multiple occasions and a long‑standing aspirant for permanent status, India treats the UNSC as a forum where principles it prizes — sovereignty, non‑intervention, and the primacy of peaceful settlement — must be reconciled with emerging humanitarian norms and collective security imperatives.
- Veto and reform: India’s push for UNSC reform (including permanent seats for elected members or new permanent members) is shaped by its strategic desire to mitigate the distorting effects of the P5 veto on global governance and crisis management.
- Use of Chapter VII and military intervention: India has been cautious about endorsing expansive Chapter VII mandates that allow for forcible regime change or open‑ended military involvement; India’s strategic culture emphasizes consent‑based peace operations, UN multilateral legitimacy, and restraint unless clear multilateral mandates and exit strategies are present.
- ICC and referrals: India’s approach to ICC referrals is calibrated by concerns about sovereignty and selective justice; while India supports individual accountability in principle, it is wary of politicized uses of international criminal law that bypass domestic mechanisms or unequal application across states.
- R2P and protections for civilians: India broadly endorses the protection of civilians but remains cautious about operationalizing R2P in ways that undermine state sovereignty or become a pretext for military intervention without broad consensus.
- Practical effect on policy: UNSC decisions — binding Chapter VII measures, sanctions regimes, and peacekeeping mandates — directly influence India’s operational planning (deployment contributions to UN missions, sanctions compliance, diplomatic alignments), as well as its broader conception of strategic autonomy.

Conclusion
The UNSC is simultaneously a legal authority, political arena and barometer of great‑power relations. For India, the Council’s powers under Chapters VI and VII, its monopoly on binding security resolutions, its ability to refer cases to the ICC, and the political realities of P5 vetoes are not abstract legalities: they meaningfully shape India’s choices about alliance, restraint, the use of force, and institutional reform. Understanding the Council’s role — and learning to track its resolutions, vetoes and jurisprudential practice through catalogues such as UNBISnet — is therefore essential for any rigorous account of India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

## Chapter X — The Permanent Five (P5) and Their Strategic Significance for India

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) remains the central multilateral institution for collective security. Its five permanent members — the so‑called P5 — possess unique privileges and responsibilities that shape global responses to crises and have profound implications for the strategic calculations of middle powers, including India. This section outlines the P5’s composition, the legal and practical scope of their veto power, the two major seat successions since 1945, the P5’s material advantages (including nuclear status), the political coalitions they form, and the enduring debate over Security Council reform — all viewed through the lens of India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### Composition of the P5: continuity and historical legacies

At the founding of the UN in 1945 the Security Council’s permanent membership reflected the wartime balance of power: the Republic of China (ROC), France (represented initially by the Provisional Government), the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the United Kingdom, and the United States. Two major seat changes have occurred since:

- China: the seat originally held by the Republic of China (ROC) was transferred to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) by General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971. The ROC (Taiwan) ceased to be a UN member and is excluded from UN representation.
- USSR → Russia: following the USSR’s dissolution in 1991, the Russian Federation was accepted as the USSR’s legal successor and retained the permanent seat without a formal replacement vote.

The following table summarizes the P5 membership, regional groupings, and notable former representations.

| Member (current) | UN Regional Group | Former representation (if any) |
|---|---:|---|
| China — People’s Republic of China (PRC) | Asia‑Pacific | Republic of China (ROC) (1945–1971) |
| France — French Republic | Western Europe and Others | Provisional Government (1945–1946); Fourth Republic (1946–1958) |
| Russia — Russian Federation | Eastern Europe | Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (1945–1991) |
| United Kingdom — United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland | Western Europe and Others | — |
| United States — United States of America | Western Europe and Others | — |

Note: the UN “regional group” is a diplomatic classification used for elections and organization within the UN system and does not always correspond strictly to geography.

### The veto: legal scope and political effect

A defining institutional privilege of each P5 member is the veto: any negative vote by a P5 on a "substantive" draft resolution blocks its adoption. Two clarifications are essential for understanding its scope:

- Procedural vs substantive: The veto applies only to substantive matters. Procedural decisions are not subject to veto. The line between procedural and substantive can itself be contested and politically charged.
- Debate is not halted: A veto prevents adoption of a resolution but does not terminate Council deliberations on the subject; the Council can continue to discuss, draft alternative measures, or use other instruments (e.g., presidential statements, sanctions frameworks if consensus is reachable).

Practically, the veto confers decisive influence to each P5 member over major UN actions concerning international peace and security. This power has been used variably over time — the USSR used it frequently during the Cold War; usage patterns shifted after 1991, though Russia and other P5 members continue to deploy the veto when core interests are perceived to be at stake.

For India, the veto represents both an institutional obstacle to multilateral enforcement actions (particularly when they conflict with major‑power interests) and a focal point for reform advocacy aimed at enhancing the voice and authority of rising and middle powers.

### Two seat successions: China (1971) and Russia (1991)

- China (GA Resolution 2758, 1971): After the Chinese Civil War, the ROC government retreated to Taiwan in 1949. Over subsequent decades the PRC consolidated control of mainland China. In 1971 the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758, recognizing the PRC as “the only legitimate representative of China to the United Nations” and effectively expelling the ROC. The PRC assumed China’s permanent seat on the Security Council. This change underscores how domestic politico‑military outcomes (civil war, regime consolidation) can translate into shifts in international representation.
- USSR → Russian Federation (1991): The Russian Federation assumed the USSR’s seat as the recognized legal successor state without a separate vote in the General Assembly or Security Council; member states accepted this continuity. The succession highlights the pragmatic accommodation of great‑power continuity in international institutions.

Both successions illustrate that permanent seats are not purely personalities of regimes but are anchored in claims of state continuity and international recognition — factors that inform India’s campaigns for greater UNSC representation.

### Material power of the P5: military expenditure, arms exports, and nuclear status

The P5’s global influence is grounded in concentrated material capabilities:

- Military spending and arms exports: The P5 collectively have consistently accounted for a very large share of global military expenditure. For example, in 2013 the P5’s combined defence spending exceeded US$1 trillion — more than 55% of global military expenditure — with the United States alone accounting for over 35%. They are also among the world’s largest arms exporters, shaping global force structures and defence relationships.
- Nuclear-weapon states under the NPT: Under the Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the five states that had manufactured and tested nuclear devices before 1 January 1967 — the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China — are formally recognized as "nuclear‑weapon states." This legal recognition confers both privileges and obligations and underpins a significant element of their international standing.

India’s strategic culture must manage the asymmetry implied by P5 material advantages. India is a nuclear‑armed state outside the NPT’s definition of nuclear‑weapon states; this status has consequences for procurement, technology access, normative arguments about non‑proliferation, and India’s case for enhanced UNSC representation.

### Political coalitions: the P3 and other alignments

The term “P3” refers to the politically aligned trio of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France — Western democratic powers that frequently coordinate positions in the Security Council. This alignment reflects durable political and normative affinities. Other ad hoc coalitions form around regional and issue‑specific interests (e.g., Russia–China coordination on certain sovereignty issues). For India, navigating these coalitions is part of a pragmatic multilateral strategy: cooperating where interests align, resisting or hedging where they do not.

### UNSC reform: prospects and India’s ambition

Longstanding debates on Security Council reform typically raise three interrelated demands: (1) enlargement of permanent membership to reflect contemporary power distributions (candidates frequently cited include India, Germany, Japan, and Brazil); (2) improved geographic representation, particularly of Africa; and (3) changes to veto rules (e.g., voluntary restraint, limitations in cases of mass atrocity, or formal abolition). Reform faces acute political obstacles:

- Any amendment to the UN Charter requires a two‑thirds majority in the General Assembly and ratification by two‑thirds of UN members, including all P5 members — i.e., a single P5 veto (or refusal to ratify) can block charter amendment.
- P5 resistance: Current permanent members have understandably resisted reforms that dilute their privileged position or impose binding constraints on the veto.

India has long campaigned for a permanent seat, arguing that its population size, economic weight, democratic credentials, contributions to UN peacekeeping, and civilizational history justify enlarged representation. From India’s strategic perspective, achieving permanent membership would enhance its ability to shape responses to regional crises (e.g., in South Asia) and global norms on security. In the near term, however, reform prospects remain limited, and India’s policy blends continued reform advocacy with pragmatic engagement as a non‑permanent member and as a leading voice of the Global South.

### Practical effects on India’s strategic culture and national security policy

The P5 structure and practices shape India’s strategic orientation in several concrete ways:

- Multilateral realism: India’s foreign policy combines principled support for multilateral institutions with realistic assessments of great‑power constraints — a reflection of strategic autonomy in practice.
- Nuclear policy and normative engagement: Because India was not recognized as an NPT nuclear‑weapon state, it has pursued de facto nuclear deterrence while seeking normative acceptance (e.g., civil nuclear agreements with P5 members). India’s stance illustrates how institutional exclusion can incentivize independent capability development and alternative diplomacy.
- Coalitions and issue selection: India seeks issue coalitions where it can exercise influence (peacekeeping, counterterrorism, development), while accepting limits where P5 interests diverge.
- Reform strategy: India’s UNSC ambitions are pursued through long‑term diplomatic nation‑building (bilateral ties with P5, outreach to African and Latin American states, contributions to peacekeeping) rather than overreliance on rapid institutional change.

In sum, the P5 arrangement is a structural constraint on multilateralism and a focal point for India’s long‑term institutional ambitions. It shapes how New Delhi balances normative rhetoric (equity, representative institutions) with material strategy (alliances, capabilities, selective multilateralism).

### Key terms

- P5: The five permanent members of the UN Security Council — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
- Veto: The power of a P5 member to block adoption of a substantive Security Council resolution by casting a negative vote.
- GA Resolution 2758 (1971): The UN General Assembly resolution recognizing the People’s Republic of China as the only legitimate representative of China to the UN and removing the Republic of China (Taiwan) from UN representation.
- NPT: Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty — defines “nuclear‑weapon states” as those that tested nuclear devices before 1 January 1967 (US, UK, France, Russia, China).

Concluding observation: The P5 remain the fulcrum of international peace and security architecture. For India — a rising power with global ambitions but constrained by entrenched institutional rules — navigating the P5’s privileges, influence, and resistance to reform is a strategic imperative shaping its national security policy and its conception of responsible global leadership.

### Chapter X — The Veto in the UN Security Council: Law, Practice, and Implications for India’s Strategic Posture

This section examines the legal architecture, historical practice and political consequences of the Security Council veto. The veto is central to how the United Nations responds to threats to international peace and security; it also shapes great‑power behaviour and the prospects for institutional reform — all matters of direct relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Legal mechanics and formal rules
- Article 27 of the UN Charter governs Council decision‑making. For substantive matters it requires the affirmative vote of nine of the fifteen members. In practice, however, any negative vote by one of the five permanent members (P5) — China, France, the Russian Federation (originally the USSR), the United Kingdom and the United States — functions as a veto and blocks adoption of a proposal.
- Abstentions are not treated as vetoes. If nine members vote in favour and none of the P5 cast a negative vote, a resolution is adopted even when one or more permanent members abstain. This distinction — veto versus abstention — is an important tactical instrument: states sometimes abstain to avoid direct confrontation while still preventing an escalatory framing.
- Amendments to the UN Charter require, in effect, unanimity among the P5: all five permanent members must vote in favour (an abstention by a permanent member will block an amendment).
- The veto formally applies only to “substantive” matters. Procedural decisions are taken by the Council without the veto; however, the Council itself decides whether a question is procedural or substantive, making this distinction a recurrent subject of political contestation.
- A narrow set of non‑binding decisions that directly affect a permanent member have also developed as matters beyond the veto’s typical application in practice, though these categories are contested and politically negotiated.

2. Origins and constitutional politics
- During the San Francisco Conference (1945) small and middle powers sought to limit or exclude a blanket veto. The principal Allied powers insisted on the veto as the price for their participation; the Big Five effectively secured it by threatening to withhold agreement to the Charter. The veto therefore represents an early bargain designed to reconcile sovereign prerogatives of great powers with the aspiration for collective security.
- Delegates used vivid rhetoric to underline the leverage inherent in the veto. Contemporary accounts record dramatized statements by major power representatives illustrating that a single negative vote could nullify collective action — a symbolic reminder of the veto’s constraining force.

3. Patterns of veto use: statistics and trends (to 2012)
- By 2012, Security Council members had cast a total of 269 vetoes since the Council began operations.
- Distribution by country up to 2012: USSR/Russia 128, United States 89, United Kingdom 32, France 18, China 9.
- The Soviet Union cast most of its vetoes during the early Cold War: roughly two‑thirds of the USSR/Russia tally occurred in the Council’s first ten years of life.
- Post‑Cold War usage shows a different profile. Between 1996 and 2012 the recorded vetoes were: United States 13, Russia 7, China 5; France and the United Kingdom cast no vetoes in that interval. These numbers reflect changing geopolitics and the issues animating P5 interests in different eras.

4. Notable cases and categories of veto use
- Early exercise of the veto (February 1946): Andrei Vishinsky’s Soviet veto blocked Council action concerning French forces in Syria and Lebanon; this early precedent underscored that the veto applied to a broad range of Council matters beyond immediate declarations of war or peace.
- Admission of states: the USSR used the veto repeatedly to delay or block admission of states during the late 1940s and 1950s (Austria, Italy, Japan and others figure among states whose admission was affected). Vetoes on membership were an instrument of Cold War diplomacy.
- Suez Crisis (1956): the United Kingdom and France employed vetoes to fend off Council condemnation of their actions in Egypt, illustrating how permanent members can use the veto to shield national policy choices from international censure.
- First US veto (1970): the United States cast its first veto to block General Assembly action on Southern Rhodesia — a sign that the U.S. began to use the veto in defense of its geopolitical and strategic priorities.
- 1985–1990 period: the United States cast 27 vetoes, often to block resolutions seen as hostile to Israel or to protect U.S. interests in Central America (Panama) and the Korean peninsula.
- Secretary‑General selection: permanent members have used the veto to influence the Secretariat. Blocking of Secretary‑General candidates — most famously the U.S. veto against Boutros‑Ghali’s re‑election in 1996 — shows the veto’s effect on the UN’s personnel and leadership independence.

5. Political effects and normative critiques
- The veto grants permanent members disproportionate influence over the Council’s agenda and outcomes; by design it empowers great powers to prevent collective decisions they deem inimical to national interests.
- The practice of veto use has periodically undermined the UN’s credibility and perceived impartiality, particularly where vetoes are used to shield allies from condemnation or action in the face of mass atrocities.
- The procedural/substantive distinction compounds the problem: because the Council defines the boundary, a state can attempt to reframe substantive questions as procedural to avoid veto exposure, while others press to keep the issue substantive to allow an effective veto.

6. Reform debates and practical proposals
- Calls to reform the veto are frequent in diplomatic and academic debates. Proposals include:
  - Abolishing or limiting the veto outright (politically difficult because Charter amendment requires the affirmative vote of all P5).
  - Expanding permanent membership to include new states (prospective members often demand permanent seats without veto or with limited veto privileges).
  - Voluntary restraint mechanisms such as “codes of conduct” under which P5 agree not to use the veto in cases of mass atrocities (e.g., genocide, crimes against humanity); several such initiatives and proposals have been floated but not universally adopted.
  - Regional permanent seats or qualified majority voting for certain issue‑areas.
- Practical obstacles are structural: formal Charter amendment requires the concurrence of the P5, which removes incentives for radical change by those who benefit from the current arrangement. Thus most reform efforts have focused on political, voluntary, or incremental measures rather than wholesale constitutional revision.

7. Strategic implications for India
- India’s strategic culture prizes international legitimacy, multilateralism and an effective rules‑based order; at the same time, New Delhi is realist about the distribution of power and seeks institutional change that reflects contemporary realities.
- India has long advocated Security Council reform: it supports expansion of both permanent and non‑permanent seats and has argued that any enlargement should better reflect contemporary geopolitical weight. India has also advanced the argument that new permanent members should not be granted an unfettered veto — a position consistent with its broader preference for limiting great‑power privilege within multilateral institutions.
- The veto constrains India’s policy options in two ways. First, it limits the Council’s ability to respond effectively to crises in which India has an interest, because a P5 veto can prevent action even when a broad international coalition favours intervention or sanction. Second, the veto is an obstacle to India’s ambition for permanent membership with equal standing: any Charter amendment to enlarge or restructure the Council will require P5 agreement, including on whether new members would receive veto rights.
- India must therefore balance two imperatives: pressing for meaningful reform while cultivating bilateral ties with P5 members whose assent is necessary for constitutional change. In practice, India has combined public advocacy for reform (and principled critique of veto misuse) with quiet diplomacy aimed at securing the practical support required for institutional advancement.
- The veto debate also shapes India’s operational choices in multilateral fora: India may favour alternative multilateral mechanisms (regional groupings, coalitions of the willing, or General Assembly initiatives such as “Uniting for Peace”) when Security Council action is blocked, while continuing to press for longer‑term structural change.

8. Conclusion: durability and limits of change
- The veto remains a durable feature of the UN system — a constitutional mechanism that reflects the bargaining that created the organization and the continuing primacy of great‑power consent. Its use has waxed and waned with geopolitical cycles: high Soviet usage in the early Cold War; variable usage by other P5 members in later periods, reflecting regional commitments and strategic priorities.
- Reform is politically feasible only incrementally: voluntary restraint, normative pressure, and creative institutional workarounds have produced modest advances, but fundamental change requires the assent of those who presently wield the veto.
- For India, the practical challenge is to convert normative leadership on reform into concrete institutional gains without alienating powerful states whose cooperation is necessary. The veto is therefore both an object of India’s diplomatic reform agenda and a structural constraint shaping New Delhi’s strategic choices in the near term.

## Non‑Permanent Membership of the UN Security Council: Composition, Practice and Political Significance for India

This section examines the role, selection and practical politics of the ten non‑permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). Though often overshadowed by the five permanent members and their vetoes, non‑permanent members exercise meaningful influence on agenda‑setting, coalitions and the conduct of global security governance — outcomes of direct relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### Composition and legal basis
- The Security Council is composed of five permanent members and ten non‑permanent members that rotate among UN Member States by geographic region. The arrangements are set by the UN Charter and subsequent General Assembly practice and resolutions.
- Non‑permanent members each have one vote on Council decisions but do not possess veto power; this distinction is central to how middle powers, including India, seek to shape outcomes without the blocking authority of the P5.

### Election rules and mechanics
- Ten non‑permanent members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two‑year terms beginning 1 January. Five seats are renewed each year.
- A candidate must secure at least a two‑thirds majority of the votes cast in the General Assembly to be elected to a seat. Voting is by secret ballot.
- If no candidate reaches the two‑thirds threshold, the rules provide for alternating rounds of restricted and unrestricted voting, a process that can produce prolonged deadlocks.
- A retiring non‑permanent member is ineligible for immediate re‑election.

### Regional distribution and the “Arab seat”
- The current regional distribution (as practiced) is: Africa 3; Asia‑Pacific 2; Latin America & Caribbean 2; Western European & Others 2; Eastern Europe 1.
- There is a longstanding practical arrangement whereby one seat allocated to either the Asia‑Pacific Group or the African Group is filled by an Arab state, with the allocation alternating between those groups. This informal rotation reflects regional political realities and the cross‑cutting identity of the Arab states.

### Election timing pattern
- Election patterns by the calendar year are regularized to produce geographic continuity:
  - Terms beginning in even‑numbered years: elections commonly produce two African members and one each from Eastern Europe, Asia‑Pacific and Latin America & Caribbean (the Asia/Africa seat in that year often filled by an Arab state).
  - Terms beginning in odd‑numbered years: elections commonly produce two Western European & Others members and one each from Asia‑Pacific, Africa and Latin America & Caribbean.

### Deadlocks, compromises and split terms: empirical illustrations
- The need for a two‑thirds majority can create entrenched electoral stalemates. A notable earlier example occurred in 1979 when Cuba and Colombia deadlocked for three months and a record 154 rounds of voting; both ultimately withdrew and Mexico was elected as a compromise.
- Rare but politically creative solutions have emerged. In 2016 Italy and the Netherlands failed to attain the two‑thirds threshold for the two Western European & Others Group seats and negotiated a split term — each taking one year of the two‑year period. This informal agreement was then presented to and approved by the General Assembly. Such split‑term arrangements are exceptional and require inter‑governmental bargaining and Assembly ratification.
- More generally, persistent deadlocks are frequently resolved when one or more candidates withdraw in favour of a compromise candidate endorsed by the relevant regional group.

### Rights, practical roles and institutional opportunities for non‑permanent members
- Non‑permanent members participate fully in Council business, can preside over the Council when their alphabetical turn arrives (the presidency rotates monthly), and can sponsor or co‑sponsor resolutions and arrange briefings and debates.
- Holding a non‑permanent seat raises a state’s diplomatic profile, provides a platform for agenda‑setting on issues of national priority, and allows the occupant to influence procedural and substantive outcomes through coalition building.
- Nevertheless, the absence of veto power limits the capacity of non‑permanent members to unilaterally shape the most consequential decisions; influence is produced through persuasion, diplomacy and strategic alignment with permanent members and other Council partners.

### Practical politics and regional coordination
- Regional groups commonly coordinate endorsements and produce “clean slates” in order to minimize intra‑regional competition and the risk of deadlock. Endorsements and informal deals (including split terms) are tools to manage competition and preserve regional solidarity.
- The opaque bargaining that precedes General Assembly ballots — cross‑regional tradeoffs, campaign promises, and diplomatic inducements — is an important determinant of outcomes but remains under‑documented in public records.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India has sought to use Security Council participation — both as a frequent non‑permanent member and as an advocate for reform — to advance its global standing, to shape responses to regional crises, and to promote issues (peacekeeping, counter‑terrorism, development‑security links) consistent with its strategic preferences.
- A non‑permanent seat enables India to frame debates, chair Council subsidiary bodies during its presidency months, and build cross‑regional coalitions. These opportunities fit within a broader Indian strategy that privileges multilateral engagement, normative influence and the pursuit of a permanent seat on a reformed Council.
- For Indian national security policymakers, non‑permanent membership is thus both an instrument of diplomacy and a symbolic affirmation of strategic reach: it amplifies voice without conferring veto power and requires skillful coalition management and issue selection.

### Data integrity note (on the source table)
- The source text contained a table listing current elected members for terms 2022–2026 that appeared misaligned and confusing; country‑to‑region mappings and term assignments were ambiguous. Because composition and term dates are time‑sensitive and consequential, researchers should verify membership lists and dates against official UN Secretariat records or the UN General Assembly election outcomes before relying on them in analysis.

### Additional procedural and analytical points (summary)
- General Assembly voting for UNSC seats is by secret ballot; rounds are governed by “restricted” and “unrestricted” procedures if the two‑thirds threshold is not met.
- The Council presidency rotates monthly in alphabetical order; non‑permanent members therefore periodically hold the presidency and its agenda‑setting prerogatives.
- Split‑term arrangements are informal political agreements; they are exceptional and require explicit election outcomes to implement.
- Given their transient tenure, studying the influence of non‑permanent members benefits from linking seat‑holding periods to voting records, sponsorship activity, and outcomes on items of national interest.

### Recommendations for researchers and students of Indian strategic policy
- Verify current membership and term dates with the UN Secretariat before using lists or tables, because these are time‑sensitive.
- If required, permit extraction and reformatting of current UNSC non‑permanent membership into a validated table for citation.
- For deeper empirical analysis of India’s use of the Council, map India’s non‑permanent terms to (a) its sponsorship/co‑sponsorship of resolutions, (b) voting coalitions and patterns, and (c) shifts in its broader foreign and security policy to assess causal links between Council participation and national strategy.

This concise but comprehensive account situates the formal rules and informal practices governing non‑permanent UNSC membership and highlights why these institutions matter for Indian strategic actors seeking influence in global security governance.

## The Presidency of the UN Security Council: Mechanisms, Instruments and Implications for India

The monthly presidency of the UN Security Council is a procedural institution with outsized political and symbolic significance. Although formally limited in time and scope, the presidency confers agenda-setting power, a platform for public diplomacy, and modest procedural levers that sitting members can use to shape the Council’s work. For a state like India—whose strategic culture favors multilateral engagement, incremental influence-building and normative framing—the presidency is an instrument that can be used to amplify priorities (peacekeeping, counter‑terrorism, development‑security linkages, maritime security) and practice coalition management. Below I set out the presidency’s core duties and instruments, the mechanics of rotation (with the 2025 schedule), the legal and political limits of presidential acts, and the practical implications for India’s national security diplomacy.

Core duties and procedural powers
- Presiding over meetings: The president chairs all formal and informal Council sessions during the month, controlling the conduct of debate, the order of speakers and, in many cases, the tone of proceedings.
- Agenda setting: The president proposes the Council’s provisional agenda for the month, can add or prioritize items, and convenes meetings—powers that allow limited strategic steering of attention.
- Crisis oversight and convening authority: The president may call urgent debates, convene Arria-formula or informal consultations and coordinate emergency responses, which is valuable when rapid collective action or messaging is required.
- Public‑facing representation: The president speaks for the Council in press briefings and public statements, shaping the Council’s external messaging.

Instruments available to the president
- Presidential Statements: These are formal Council products (adopted in the name of the Security Council) used to express unified political positions on issues or events. They are diplomatic instruments rather than binding legal acts—valuable for articulating collective views where a resolution is unnecessary or politically impracticable.
  - Consensus requirement: Presidential Statements require unanimity (consensus) among Council members; any member can block issuance. This imposes a diplomatic constraint on the presiding country, which must manage member sensitivities to produce unified wording.
- Notes by the President: Notes are used to record intent, explain procedural decisions, or indicate that the full Council may pursue a matter. They are technical or declaratory in nature and do not carry the legal force of Chapter VII resolutions.
- Resolutions (limited role): Only the full Council can adopt legally binding resolutions; the president can facilitate drafting and negotiation but cannot unilaterally promulgate binding measures.

Legal and political limits
- Presidential instruments are political, not judicial: Presidential Statements and notes do not have the binding legal weight of Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII. Their power is primarily normative and rhetorical.
- Constrained by member positions and veto dynamics: Agenda-setting and public messaging are influential but ultimately constrained by the positions of the 15 Council members and, where applicable, by the veto power of permanent members. The presidency cannot override the need for agreement on substantive measures.
- Rotation among sitting members only: Only Council members (the five permanent and ten elected non‑permanent members) assume the presidency. A state must be a sitting member in order to hold the office.

Mechanics of rotation and the 2025 presidency schedule
- Order and duration: The presidency rotates monthly among the 15 Council members, in English alphabetical order of their member-state names as recognized by the UN. Name-formatting and changes in official names can alter rotation order in practice.
- Permanent members included: Permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States) participate in the rotation; their presidency month is procedurally identical to that of non‑permanent members, although their political weight differs because of veto power and geopolitical influence.

2025 Security Council presidency schedule (month — country)
- January — Algeria  
- February — China  
- March — Denmark  
- April — France  
- May — Greece  
- June — Guyana  
- July — Pakistan

Strategic implications for India
- Opportunity windows: Each country listed for 2025 will have a narrow but visible window to shape Council priorities and public messaging. For India, when it holds the presidency (in any term it serves on the Council), the month provides a concentrated opportunity to spotlight issues consonant with its strategic culture—e.g., peacekeeping norms, counter‑terrorism cooperation, maritime security, sustainable development and capacity building.
- Consensus and coalition management: Because Presidential Statements require consensus, effective use of the presidency demands early and careful diplomacy: negotiating language, managing competing sensitivities (including those of permanent members), and building coalitions among non‑permanent members and regional groups.
- Agenda setting versus substantive power: The presidency enables India to set the Council’s focus but does not confer additional substantive authority. India’s strategic approach thus needs to combine agenda initiatives with parallel efforts to secure long-term support for substantive action—through bilateral diplomacy, group-based negotiation (e.g., with like-minded states), and engagement inside and outside the Council.
- Public diplomacy and normative leadership: The public-facing role of the president allows India to project normative positions and craft international narratives that complement its domestic and regional priorities—an attractive channel for a state that prizes principled multilateralism.
- Practical recommendations (brief): prioritize a limited number of achievable agenda items for the presidency month; undertake intensive pre‑month consultations to secure consensus language; coordinate with regional groupings and like-minded partners; and use the presidency to link security and development narratives in ways consistent with India’s broader foreign policy identity.

Conclusion
The Security Council presidency is a compact but potent instrument of multilateral influence. It offers procedural levers and publicity that align well with India’s incremental, coalition-centered strategic culture. Yet its utility depends on diplomatic craftsmanship: securing consensus for Presidential Statements, navigating veto politics, and converting agenda-setting moments into durable outcomes. For Indian national security policy, the presidency is best seen as a platform for magnifying long-term priorities rather than as a source of standalone coercive power.

### The Security Council Chamber: Architecture, Procedure and Implications for Indian Strategic Practice

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) chamber in New York is at once a working room for high diplomacy and a stage for symbolic communication. Its material design, ritualized procedures and public visibility shape how states — including India — conduct strategic signaling, pursue normative aims, and contest decision-making authority within the post‑1945 international order.

Description and symbolism
- The chamber normally occupies a designated hall in the United Nations Conference Building in New York City. It was designed by Norwegian architect Arnstein Arneberg and donated by Norway as part of the post‑war construction of UN headquarters.
- Per Krohg’s large 1952 mural — variously described as “Untitled (Mural for Peace)” or as an image of a phoenix rising — dominates the chamber. Its iconography of rebirth and renewal speaks directly to the founding narrative of the UN as the architect of a new, collective security order after the devastation of World War II. The mural has become central to the Council’s identity and is frequently evoked in descriptions of the Council’s symbolism and iconography.
- The chamber’s physical setting — the horseshoe table, the central seat of the president, reserved end seats for guest speakers — frames both procedure and theatricality. The space was refurbished under the UN Capital Master Plan (a broad programme for restoration and modernization of UN facilities); the Security Council chamber underwent renovations funded by Norway (the original donor) at a cost reported at about US$5 million and was re‑opened on 16 April 2013.

Procedures, presence and meeting practice
- The Security Council normally meets in its New York chamber, but it is not bound to regular sessions in the same way as the General Assembly. The Council can convene emergency meetings, and it must be operationally ready for urgent business: each Council member is required to keep a representative present at UN Headquarters at all times so that an emergency meeting can be called without delay.
- On occasion the Council has met outside New York — notable locations include Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Panama City and Geneva — reflecting the body’s flexibility and occasional efforts to regionalize attention on specific crises.
- Seating in the chamber is ritualized: delegations sit at a horseshoe-shaped table with the Council president in the central position, the Secretary to the president on the president’s right and the Under‑Secretary to the president’s left; other representatives sit clockwise in alphabetical order beginning from the president’s place. Two end seats are reserved for guest speakers. The presidency itself rotates monthly among Council members, normally following the English alphabetical order of member states’ names as used by the UN; the seating order therefore rotates monthly in line with the presidency change.
- Meetings are public in the chamber. That publicness converts routine procedure into an opportunity for symbolic diplomacy: delegations sometimes stage walkouts, timed interventions or other gestures in view of cameras and visiting audiences to communicate positions beyond the formal record.

Legal and political context
- The Security Council’s composition is compact but consequential: 15 members in total, five permanent members (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) and ten non‑permanent members elected for two‑year terms.
- The five permanent members possess the veto — a defining procedural and political instrument that allows any one of them to block the adoption of a substantive Council decision.
- The Council’s authority to adopt binding decisions is grounded in Chapter VII of the UN Charter; accordingly, Council action can include legally binding measures such as sanctions or the authorization of force, subject to the political constraints introduced by permanent member dynamics and the veto.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India — a long‑standing advocate of multilateralism and a frequent participant in UN peace operations — the Security Council chamber is both an instrument and a symbol. Indian strategic culture values international legitimacy, norm formation and the institutionalization of multilateral responses to security threats; it therefore invests in the Council as an arena where status, narrative and policy intersect.
- India’s engagement with the Council is shaped by the institutional realities of composition and veto power. Indian policy elites have repeatedly argued that the current Council structure constrains equitable representation and undermines the Council’s democratic legitimacy; this critique feeds India’s sustained campaign for permanent membership (as part of broader reform coalitions) and its insistence on procedural and normative rules that reflect contemporary global power distributions.
- The chamber’s public character and ritualized seating provide purposeful opportunities for diplomatic signaling. Walkouts, timed statements and even the choreography of seat placement can be leveraged to communicate to multiple audiences — other governments, domestic constituencies and international publics. Such symbolic uses of the chamber align with India’s broader practice of combining substantive negotiation with public signalling to advance foreign policy objectives.
- Operationally, the Council’s capacity to convene emergency meetings underscores the importance of continuous representation: India’s permanent mission to the UN, like those of other members, must maintain readiness to act rapidly on security developments that could affect its strategic interests (e.g., regional crises, counter‑terrorism measures, sanctions that touch trade and diaspora issues).
- The Krohg mural and the refurbished chamber underscore a tension central to Indian strategic thinking about the UN: reverence for the organization’s founding ideals of collective security and human progress, alongside a pragmatic demand for institutional reform to make those ideals more inclusive and effective. India’s approach combines respect for the UN’s symbolic order with patient, sometimes forceful, advocacy for change in decision‑making structures — a duality that reflects its evolving global aspirations and security calculus.

Conclusion
The Security Council chamber is more than architecture: it is a procedural ecosystem and a communicative stage. Its design elements — from Krohg’s mural to the horseshoe seating — codify an ethos of collective security while simultaneously providing states with tools for symbolic diplomacy. For India, engaging effectively in this space requires mastery of both the formal rules (seating, presidency rotation, constant representation) and the performative possibilities (public meetings, walkouts, diplomatic choreography), together with sustained policy advocacy aimed at reforming the institutional constraints embodied by veto power and permanent membership.

## Consultation room (United Nations Security Council)

The Security Council’s consultation room — the physical and procedural space where “informal consultations” take place — is a revealing window into how the Council actually conducts its business. Over several decades the consultation room has come to embody a paradox at the heart of the Council: the institutional premium on confidentiality and flexible bargaining that can produce rapid, negotiated outcomes, and the corresponding costs to transparency and public accountability.

### Origins and evolution of the consultation room
Public scrutiny of the main Security Council Chamber gradually pushed much of the Council’s substantive work out of the spotlight and into closed-door meetings. In 1978 West Germany financed the construction of a conference room adjacent to the Chamber expressly to host these informal consultations. That modest architectural intervention had outsized institutional effects. Informal consultations soon eclipsed formal public meetings as the Council’s primary working mode. By the mid-1990s the shift was unmistakable — a French ambassador famously complained in 1994 that informal consultations had become the norm while public meetings were “largely symbolic.” In 2013 a renovation of the consultation room funded by Russia and publicly praised by the Russian ambassador underscored the room’s continuing centrality to Council diplomacy.

The practice of meeting informally predates and is independent of any explicit provision of the UN Charter; it rests on Council custom and the flexible interpretation of its rules of procedure. Over time informal consultations have ossified into a conventional, routinized instrument of Council diplomacy.

### Physical access and procedural character
Access to the consultation room is tightly restricted. Only Security Council members are permitted inside; the press and the rest of the UN membership are excluded. Crucially, no formal verbatim record is kept of what transpires in these consultations. The absence of an official transcript is not an accidental lacuna: it is an enabling condition. By removing statements from the permanent public record, the format creates a space for private give-and-take, candid argumentation, and iterative bargaining that would be difficult to sustain under cameras and printed minutes.

Because of these features, informal consultations operate outside the strictures of the public Chamber. They are neither secret in the legal sense (the Council’s work is still governed by its rules) nor transparent; rather, they are confidential in practice and shape outcomes through off-the-record exchange.

### Functions, dynamics and procedural tools
Informal consultations serve several interrelated functions:

- They permit frank, flexible negotiation. Delegations can probe red lines, offer language trades, and explore compromise formulations without immediate domestic or international political cost.
- They allow the Council to “pre-process” draft resolutions: text is negotiated, amended and agreed informally so that the formal Chamber meeting becomes a relatively brief act of ratification.
- They concentrate influence in the hands of Council members who are most adept at behind-the-scenes bargaining — often the permanent members and those non-permanent members with strong diplomatic networks.

The consultation room’s confidentiality also facilitates distinctive procedural manoeuvres. A permanent member can, during consultations, signal opposition in a way that prevents a sponsor from formally putting a resolution to a vote — a practice sometimes termed a “pocket veto.” This is not a separate legal veto mechanism under the Council’s rules; rather it is a diplomatic practice that uses the room’s private bargaining dynamics to block a proposal before it reaches a recorded, public rejection. Formal vetoes (the Article 27 veto) are reserved for instances when a permanent member wants an explicit, recorded rejection.

An oft-cited operational consequence is that when sponsors wish to secure an explicit, recorded rebuke of a resolution, they will force a formal vote and invite a public veto. Where they prefer to avoid public confrontation, the result may simply be that the draft never reaches the vote after consultations.

### Illustrative examples and empirical patterning
Concrete examples and statistics make the pattern clear. Resolution 1373 (the post‑9/11 counter‑terrorism framework) was processed largely informally; it was adopted after intense behind‑the‑scenes work and then passed in a five‑minute public meeting without substantive debate. Similarly, year-by-year meeting data show how consultations dominated Council activity: in 2012 the Council held 160 consultations, 16 private meetings and only 9 public meetings — a striking disparity. By contrast, 2016 registered a situational shift (150 consultations, 19 private meetings and 68 public meetings), reflecting how certain crises or political configurations produce more public, televised confrontation. After the 2014 Russo‑Ukrainian crisis, for instance, televised verbal clashes in public meetings increased as members used the public forum to signal positions and deter adversaries.

Anecdotes from diplomatic memoirs and histories further illuminate dynamics inside the room. One recounting describes a delegate from a Communist country launching a propagandistic attack in a consultation only to be privately rebuked by the Soviet delegate, who insisted on maintaining a civil tone in order to preserve productive bargaining. Such moments typify how the consultation room’s norms — and the informal policing of behavior — shape the Council’s working culture.

### Implications for non-permanent members and for India’s strategic posture
Informal consultations are especially consequential for non-permanent members. Because much of the substantive outcome is decided in private, non-permanent members who cultivate negotiating skill, coalition-building, and persistent engagement can exert disproportionate influence on drafting and wording. For a country like India, which has periodically served as a non‑permanent member and which prizes consensus and calibrated diplomacy, the consultation room is both an opportunity and a constraint: it offers channels to shape outcomes discreetly and to protect sensitive national-security positions, but it also limits the scope for public justification of a national vote and reduces the visibility of a member’s contribution to the Council’s work.

More broadly, the consultation-room dynamic intersects with India’s strategic culture (which emphasizes strategic autonomy, normative multilateralism, and calibrated public signaling). India must balance use of confidential bargaining to secure favorable language on issues such as counter‑terrorism and sanctions, while retaining the ability to signal positions in public fora when strategic messaging demands transparency.

### Transparency, accountability and reform proposals
The very features that make consultations effective — restricted access and absence of formal records — generate persistent concerns about transparency and democratic accountability. Civil society, scholars and some member states have proposed reforms that seek to recalibrate the balance between confidentiality and public accountability, including:

- Publishing summary records or non‑verbatim synopses of consultations.
- Expanding briefings to non-Council members or to expert panels (including via Arria‑formula meetings) so that outside perspectives inform deliberations.
- Clarifying rules on access and the conditions under which consultations may be opened or recorded.

These proposals aim to preserve the bargaining utility of confidentiality while enhancing legitimacy through greater disclosure. The debate is essentially institutional and normative: greater publicity can strengthen democratic accountability and deterrence signalling, but can also narrow room for compromise and prolong negotiations.

### Conclusion
The consultation room is a microcosm of the Security Council’s trade-off between effective decision-making and public legitimacy. It institutionalizes a mode of diplomacy that has become central to how the Council functions: private bargaining that expedites agreement but makes much of the Council’s substantive life invisible to the wider UN membership and the public. For policymakers and analysts concerned with national security — including India’s strategic community — understanding this space is indispensable: it shapes how resolutions are drafted, how compromises are struck, and how states use both public and private fora to advance strategic ends.

## Security Council Subsidiary Bodies: Legal Basis, Forms, and Relevance for Indian Strategic Policy

Article 29 of the UN Charter gives the Security Council express power to “establish such subsidiary organs as it deems necessary for the performance of its functions.” That authority is reflected within the Council’s own procedures: Rule 28 of the Provisional Rules of Procedure restates and operationalizes the Council’s ability to create subsidiary bodies to assist in carrying out its mandates. Together, the Charter and the Rules provide the legal foundation that allows the Council to generate a strikingly diverse architecture of bodies — from routine administrative committees to international criminal tribunals and complex sanctions mechanisms.

Typology and heterogeneity
- Administrative / procedural bodies. These are created primarily to assist the Council in routine or specialized internal functions. The Committee on Admission of New Members is an archetype: it performs discrete, largely administrative tasks rooted in Charter procedures (e.g., examining applications and reporting to the Council), and its decisions have procedural — rather than adjudicatory — effect.
- Sanctions committees and monitoring mechanisms. Over the past three decades the Council has relied heavily on sanctions committees to design, implement and monitor coercive measures (travel bans, asset freezes, arms embargoes). Most sanctions committees are composed of all 15 Council members and may establish Panels of Experts or monitoring teams to investigate compliance, report on implementation and propose listings/delistings and exemptions. The Al‑Qaida/Taliban sanctions committee (established by Resolution 1267 (1999) and later reformed) offers a paradigmatic example of a long‑lived sanctions regime that combines political decision‑making by members with technical monitoring by expert panels.
- Ad hoc and judicial-style tribunals. The Council has, when it deemed necessary to respond to gross violations affecting international peace and security, created judicial organs with criminal jurisdiction. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY, Res. 827 (1993)) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR, Res. 955 (1994)) were established under Chapter VII mandates. Their creation illustrates that the Council can vest bodies with substantial, legally binding adjudicative authority — a step distinct from administrative or policy‑oriented subsidiary organs.

Functional and legal features
- Derivative authority and limits. Subsidiary bodies operate under the authority of the Security Council and derive their mandates, competences and limits from the founding Council resolutions. The scope of their powers is shaped by the text of those resolutions, the Council’s subsequent decisions and, where relevant, applicable rules of international law.
- Chapter VII provenance and binding force. When the Council acts under Chapter VII, bodies and measures created in that context carry the Council’s binding authority. The ICTY and ICTR, for instance, derived weight and legitimacy from their Chapter VII origins; likewise, Chapter VII sanctions impose legal obligations on UN Member States to implement the measures adopted by the Council.
- Organizational diversity and permanence. Subsidiary bodies vary in permanence and institutional form: some are explicitly temporary and ad hoc (special tribunals, mandate‑specific expert panels), while others become long‑lived (certain sanctions committees have operated for decades and accumulated standing practices and procedures).
- Legal personality and accountability. Most administrative committees lack separate international legal personality and function essentially as organs of the Security Council. Tribunals, by contrast, exercise judicial authority, issue binding judgments affecting individuals and generate jurisprudence that contributes to international criminal law. Oversight mechanisms also differ: subsidiary bodies report to the Council, and their accountability — both political and legal — depends on the nature of their mandate and the controlling Council resolutions.

Practical functions of sanctions and monitoring bodies
- Listing/delisting decisions and exemptions. Sanctions committees decide whom to designate for measures and process delisting petitions. They also authorize humanitarian or other exemptions when provided for in the relevant regime.
- Monitoring implementation. Panels of Experts and monitoring groups collect evidence, prepare technical reports, assess state compliance, and make policy recommendations to the Council.
- Guidance to Member States. Committees interpret and clarify operational questions arising from complex sanctions measures, serving as the Council’s operational interface with capitals and international organizations.

Relationship with other UN organs and the Secretariat
- Subsidiary bodies are, by definition, organs of the Security Council and report to it. Their interaction with the General Assembly, the Secretariat and other UN components varies according to mandate. The Secretariat often provides substantive and administrative support (research, secretariat services, facilitation of expert panels), while coordination with agencies (e.g., humanitarian or human rights bodies) depends on the tasking resolution.
- Creation without new principal organs. By deploying subsidiary bodies, the Council can operationalize and granularize mandates without creating new principal organs of the UN — a flexible institutional tool for managing complex or technical tasks.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Multilateralism, legalism and operational leverage. India’s strategic culture has long emphasised multilateral institutions and a rules‑based order. Security Council subsidiary bodies are instruments through which the Council enacts concrete measures that can directly affect India’s security interests — for example, sanctions regimes that touch regional actors, counter‑terrorism obligations, or judicial mechanisms that shape norms of accountability for mass atrocity.
- Sovereignty concerns and legal obligations. Bodies created under Chapter VII can impose binding obligations on all Member States. For a state mindful of sovereignty like India, this raises persistent questions about the balance between rule‑based international responses and respect for domestic autonomy. India’s voting record, statements and diplomatic practice often reflect sensitivity to external coercion while supporting effective multilateral action against clear threats to international peace and security.
- Operational engagement and capacity. When India serves on the Security Council (or engages with Council subsidiary bodies), it takes part in the political and technical work of committees — influencing listing decisions, shaping sanctions design, and contributing to expert monitoring. Practical capacities (legal, intelligence, diplomatic) determine India’s ability to influence outcomes, and its domestic procedures must adapt to implement Council measures (e.g., freezing assets, enforcing travel bans).
- Strategic calculation and reform agenda. India’s long‑term policy aims — including its push for a permanent Council seat — are tied to the credibility and fairness of Council instruments. The heterogeneity of subsidiary bodies underscores why reformers point to transparency, due process (especially for sanctions listing/delisting), and equitable decision‑making as central issues that affect the Council’s legitimacy and therefore India’s strategic calculus.

Conclusion
Security Council subsidiary bodies are an essential, flexible modality through which the Council translates political determinations into concrete administrative, coercive and judicial action. Their legal basis in Article 29 and Rule 28, combined with Chapter VII authority where invoked, produces a range of instruments with divergent legal characters and practical consequences. For India, engaging with and shaping the work of these bodies is both a matter of protecting national security interests and of safeguarding principles of sovereignty, due process and multilateral legitimacy that are core to its strategic culture.

## Chapter X — UN Peacekeeping: Structure, Practice and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

Overview
- United Nations peacekeeping is a Security Council–authorized instrument deployed to enforce peace agreements and to deter the resumption of hostilities after active conflict pauses or ends. Because Security Council approval is required, mandates are inherently political and reflect the bargaining among member states.
- The UN does not maintain a standing military. "Blue Helmets" — the recognizable blue headgear and light-blue insignia — are national contingents contributed voluntarily by member states. The movement received international recognition when the UN peacekeeping force was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.

Mandate, roles and organisation
- Primary roles: observe and monitor ceasefires, separate combatants, protect civilians (where mandated), support implementation of peace agreements, assist in restoring state authority and institution-building, and provide confidence-building measures between former adversaries.
- Because forces are national contingents, capabilities, training, and operational culture vary by troop-contributing country (TCC). This variation shapes mission effectiveness and the degree of autonomy UN leadership can exercise in operations.
- UN missions are supported centrally by global and regional service centres that provide logistics, technology and general support. Key service centres are located in Brindisi (Italy) and Entebbe (Uganda).

Scale, footprint and notable missions (snapshot as of 28 February 2023)
- Total uniformed and civilian personnel in UN peace operations: 86,903.
- Number of ongoing peacekeeping missions: 12.
- Number of troop-contributing countries: 121.
- Largest peacekeeping mission (uniformed personnel): MONUSCO (Democratic Republic of Congo) — 20,688.
- Smallest peacekeeping mission (uniformed personnel): UNMOGIP (India/Pakistan ceasefire monitors) — 42.
- Longest-running mission: UNTSO (United Nations Truce Supervision Organization) — active since 1948.
- Example photographic reference used in reporting and training: South African soldiers patrolling with MONUSCO (2018).

Financing and accounting
- Peacekeeping is financed separately from the UN regular budget. For fiscal year 1 July 2021–30 June 2022, peacekeeping expenditures totaled approximately US$6.38 billion.
- Method of funding: assessed contributions based on the regular assessment scale adjusted with a weighted surcharge for the five permanent members of the Security Council (the P5). The P5 surcharge is designed to offset the substantial discounts afforded to less-developed countries under the regular scale.
- The peacekeeping budget in that year financed ten of the twelve ongoing missions, the liquidation process of UNAMID (Darfur), and logistics support arrangements for AMISOM.
- Two missions — UNTSO and UNMOGIP — are financed from the regular UN budget and are excluded from the peacekeeping operations budget.
- Top assessed financial contributors for 2020–2021 (percentage shares of the peacekeeping budget):
  - United States 27.89%
  - China 15.21%
  - Japan 8.56%
  - Germany 6.09%
  - United Kingdom 5.79%
  - France 5.61%
  - Italy 3.30%
  - Russia 3.04%
  - Canada 2.73%
  - South Korea 2.26%

Accountability, health and reputational risks
- The operational record of peacekeeping is mixed: while many missions have contributed to stabilization and protections, the system has suffered serious accountability failures.
- Sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers has been credibly alleged in multiple missions (notably in the DRC, Haiti, Liberia, Sudan/South Sudan, Burundi, and Côte d’Ivoire). Such incidents produce immediate human costs and long-term damage to the legitimacy of UN operations and contributing states.
- Health and environmental risks have also arisen from troop deployments. The 2010–2013 cholera outbreak in Haiti — a catastrophic event causing over 8,000 reported deaths — has been attributed by scientific studies to UN peacekeepers from Nepal, illustrating how deployments can introduce or amplify public-health crises in host countries.
- These problems have prompted procedural reforms, but accountability and effective redress remain persistent challenges.

Operational and political implications
- Security Council authorization: mandates reflect political compromise. This constrains mission design and the range of permissible activities; stronger mandates require Security Council consensus and often stronger capabilities.
- Dependence on troop-contributing states: because national contingents supply forces, the UN relies on states for training, equipment, rules of engagement, and logistical readiness. This dependence produces uneven capability across missions and can raise questions about neutrality if certain contingents have national political ties to host-state parties.
- Financing and power: the P5 surcharge formalises a linkage between peacekeeping finance and Security Council power dynamics — a fact that has implications for debates on burden-sharing, fairness and calls for Security Council reform (including India’s longstanding bid for permanent membership).
- Logistics and efficiency: centralised service centres are an institutional response to the complexity of supporting dispersed missions. For contributors like India, these centres can both reduce deployment overheads and condition operational standardisation.
- Long-term monitoring missions: the persistence of missions such as UNTSO indicates both the intractability of certain conflicts and the UN’s role as a prolonged monitor rather than a resolver of root political disputes.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s peacekeeping identity: India has a long history as a leading troop contributor to UN missions and views peacekeeping as an instrument of responsible internationalism that complements its aspirations for a larger global role. Contributing forces provides India with operational experience, diplomatic leverage within the UN system, and soft-power dividends in host regions.
- TCC versus donor-state dynamics: India’s principal contribution has historically been personnel rather than proportionate financial support. This positions India as influential among troop-contributing states (TCCs) but constrained relative to the financial power of major contributors (e.g., the United States and China). The P5 surcharge and the concentration of financial responsibility among a handful of states highlight the asymmetry between operational contribution and budgetary influence.
- Operational lessons and standards: variability in training and conduct among contingents underscores the importance of pre-deployment training, strict vetting, and robust rules of engagement — areas where India can both benefit and lead by example. Scandals elsewhere (sexual exploitation/abuse, disease introductions) increase reputational risks for all contributors and raise domestic political sensitivities for contributing governments.
- UNMOGIP and India–Pakistan dynamics: UNMOGIP remains a small but symbolically significant presence in the India–Pakistan context. Its exclusion from the peacekeeping budget and financing from the regular UN budget reflects its distinct historical and legal character; this technicality interlinks with larger bilateral and multilateral politics that India has long navigated regarding third-party involvement in the Kashmir dispute.
- Strategic opportunity and risk: participation in UN missions reinforces India’s image as a security provider in the Global South and generates experience in multinational operations, logistics, and civil–military interaction. Simultaneously, incidents involving peacekeepers complicate these gains and require institutional safeguards to protect India’s reputation and the welfare of host populations.

Problems, risks and institutional responses (policy implications)
- Accountability: to protect credibility, India — both as a contributor and as a potential permanent Security Council member — should press for stronger accountability mechanisms (rapid, impartial investigations; victim redress mechanisms; and national-level prosecution where appropriate).
- Health safeguards: troop health protocols and environmental safeguards must be standardised and strictly enforced to prevent disease introduction and ecological harm in host countries.
- Standardisation and capacity-building: India can invest in standardised pre-deployment training, rules-of-engagement consistency and logistics interoperability to raise the quality of its contributions and to influence UN operational standards.
- Financing reform and Council politics: India’s advocacy for Security Council reform and for fairer burden-sharing can be tied to debates over the P5 surcharge, assessed shares, and the balance between financial influence and operational contribution.

Key numbers (concise)
- Personnel (28 Feb 2023): 86,903 uniformed and civilian personnel across 12 missions.
- Troop-contributing countries: 121.
- Largest mission: MONUSCO (DRC) — 20,688 uniformed personnel.
- Smallest mission: UNMOGIP (India/Pakistan) — 42 uniformed personnel.
- Longest-running mission: UNTSO — active since 1948.
- Peacekeeping expenditures (FY 2021–22): US$6.38 billion.
- Service centres: Brindisi (Italy) — global; Entebbe (Uganda) — regional.
- Missions excluded from peacekeeping budget: UNTSO, UNMOGIP.
- Top assessed contributors (2020–21): US 27.89%, China 15.21%, Japan 8.56%, Germany 6.09%, UK 5.79%, France 5.61%, Italy 3.30%, Russia 3.04%, Canada 2.73%, South Korea 2.26%.

Recommended items for further empirical update and research
- Update personnel and mission numbers beyond 28 February 2023 for current accuracy.
- Assess the latest reforms and accountability mechanisms addressing sexual exploitation, abuse and other misconduct.
- Obtain up-to-date breakdowns of troop vs police vs civilian composition within missions.
- Examine lessons and final accounting from the UNAMID liquidation process and the logistics support arrangements for AMISOM.
- Track trends in the peacekeeping budget across multiple years and any proposed changes to the P5 surcharge formula.

Concluding comment
UN peacekeeping remains a central, though imperfect, instrument of collective security. For India, participation in peace operations intersects directly with strategic culture: it is a means of demonstrating responsibility, gaining operational experience, and shaping international norms. At the same time, institutional weaknesses — in accountability, public health safeguards and financing structures — create both reputational hazards and policy challenges that India must manage as it seeks a larger role within the UN system.

## Chapter X: The UN Security Council — Mixed Performance, Structural Constraints, and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

Overview

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) occupies a central—yet contested—place in the international security architecture. Its Charter confers broad authority that spans legislative, executive and quasi-judicial functions; in practice however, the Council’s record is mixed. Scholarly assessments and empirical studies converge on a paradox: the Council has achieved notable successes in peacekeeping and conflict management, yet it has also been conspicuously absent or ineffective in some of the gravest crises of the post‑war era. This ambivalence—rooted in structural design (notably the P5 veto), resource constraints, and the politics of member states—has direct implications for how middle powers such as India conceive and practice national security policy.

1. Achievement and Failure: Historians and Empirics

- Paul Kennedy’s survey of the Council’s first sixty years frames the institution’s legacy as one of “achievements overshadowed by glaring failures.” Kennedy, like many critics, points to Bosnia and Rwanda as emblematic cases where the Council failed to prevent mass atrocity despite early warning signs and symbolic mandates.
- Quantitative studies complicate the purely negative narrative. A 2005 RAND report found that UN operations were successful in roughly two‑thirds of peacekeeping missions, and, in processes of nation‑building, UN efforts produced lasting peace in a high proportion of cases relative to certain unilateral interventions (RAND, 2005).
- The 2005 Human Security Report documents a decline in wars, genocides, and many kinds of rights abuses since the Cold War and credits part of that decline to increased international (largely UN‑led) activism—although the Report acknowledges the evidence is often circumstantial and causality is hard to establish.
- These findings underline a central truth: the UNSC can and does contribute to conflict reduction, but its successes are uneven and context dependent.

2. Structural Determinants of Council Performance

- Veto politics: The five permanent members (P5: United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China) each possess veto power. The veto is the principal fault line explaining both paralysis and selectivity—where P5 interests converge, action is likelier; where they diverge, even urgent crises can go unaddressed.
- Material capacity: Many failures are not merely legal or political but logistical. Kennedy and others emphasize the UN’s chronic lack of reliable military resources. Peacekeeping mandates without guaranteed troops, equipment, or clear rules of engagement are prone to failure.
- Mandate clarity and enforcement: The Council’s broad Charter powers—including binding Chapter VII measures—are meaningful only to the extent member states supply the necessary force, intelligence, and enforcement will. Absent sustained member‑state commitment, resolutions are often unenforced.
- Political mediation of law: Although the Charter grants expansive powers, the Council’s “legislative” or “judicial‑like” acts are politically mediated and legally contested; their implementation depends on geopolitics as much as on legal obligation.

3. Selectivity and Humanitarian Inconsistency

- Pattern of responsiveness: Empirical work shows the Council is more likely to act in highly intense conflicts or when humanitarian suffering is visible and politically salient. Yet political interests—especially those of P5 members—shape which crises are prioritized.
- Notable failures of protection: Rwanda (1994) and Srebrenica (1995) stand as the starkest illustrations of humanitarian failure—genocide and mass killing occurred despite UN attention and, in the case of Srebrenica, the presence of declared “safe areas” under peacekeepers (400 Dutch troops).
- Darfur further illustrates limits of influence: the Janjaweed’s mass violence—often backed by elements of the Sudanese state—persisted despite Council debate, sanctions, and referrals.
- Political double standards: Critics invoke contrasts such as Kuwait (1991) versus Rwanda (1994) to argue that geopolitical and strategic priorities—not humanitarian imperatives—often determine the zeal with which the Council acts.

4. Political Economy of Influence: Elections, Aid and Institutional Capture

- Studies document that election to non‑permanent seats is accompanied by substantial increases in foreign aid flows to elected states—particularly from the United States (reported increases of ~59% in some analyses) and also from Japan and Germany. UN aid (notably UNICEF) also rises, though to a smaller extent.
- This correlation—interpreted variously as diplomatic reward, influence‑seeking, or “pay‑for‑play” dynamics—suggests that access to Council influence can be monetized through bilateral incentives. The causality and normative interpretation of these patterns remain contested in the literature.
- Domestic political effects: Research finds that two‑year Security Council terms are associated with slower economic growth (a lower cumulative growth rate over the term, with the effect concentrated among African authoritarian states) and with declines in democracy and press freedom for some elected members. These patterns point to possible governance tradeoffs when states pursue short‑term diplomatic gains.

5. Normative and Geopolitical Critiques

- “Pillar of global apartheid”: Commentators such as Titus Alexander have denounced the Council as structurally inequitable—arguing the P5 constitute a narrow, largely Western (and nuclear) club that privileges certain states’ security claims.
- Nuclear and strategic exclusivity: Sudhir Chella Rajan (2006) characterizes the P5 as an exclusive “nuclear club” that tends to elevate its strategic priorities—prompting critiques about unequal protection and selective humanitarian concern.
- Calls for reform: Voices from diverse quarters—including Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in 2012 called the Council illogical and undemocratic—press for comprehensive reform: expanded permanent membership, regional representation, curbs on veto use, and more transparent practices. These reform proposals are persistent but politically difficult.

6. The UNSC and Protracted Conflicts

- The Council has struggled to resolve numerous long‑running disputes: Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Kosovo, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and, more recently and conspicuously, Syria. High‑level criticism—such as New Zealand Prime Minister John Key’s rebuke of UN inaction in Syria—has underscored international frustration with paralysis in the face of mass violence.
- The Responsibility to Protect (R2P), formulated in response to Rwanda and Srebrenica, remains an aspirational norm with inconsistent application—its operationalization is constrained by politics and vetoes.

7. Operationalities of Peacekeeping and Committee Chairs

- Peacekeeping effectiveness depends heavily on troop‑contributing countries, mandate clarity, rules of engagement, logistics and funding. The Secretariat can design missions, but success hinges on member‑state contributions and cooperation.
- Positions such as chairs of sanctions committees and the Counter‑Terrorism Committee can shape agendas and oversight. Yet chairmanship influence is limited by member cooperation, intelligence‑sharing, and political will.

8. Recent Political Flashpoints: Pakistan’s 2025 Election to the Council

- In June 2025 Pakistan was elected as a non‑permanent member for a two‑year term and was chosen as vice‑chair of the Counter‑Terrorism Committee and chair of the committee overseeing sanctions against the Taliban. The choice provoked a predictable backlash—particularly from India—given longstanding Indian allegations that Pakistan harbors individuals and groups designated as terrorists by UN bodies.
- The episode illustrates several themes: regional competition in Council elections, the political salience of committee chair appointments, and how domestic/regional rivalries can migrate into perceptions of UNSC legitimacy.

9. Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and Policy

- Reform ambitions: India’s long‑standing bid for a permanent seat on an expanded Security Council stems from both normative claims (representation, fairness) and strategic ones (to shape decisions affecting South Asian security). The Council’s mixed record reinforces India’s argument that reform is necessary to make the institution more representative and more responsive to non‑Western concerns.
- Veto politics and strategic hedging: The P5 veto capacity and selective application of norms reinforces a strategic culture in India that emphasizes autonomy and diversified partnerships. India’s diplomacy in the UNSC—balancing alignment with some P5 positions while resisting others—reflects realist calculations about great‑power interests.
- Peacekeeping and soft power: India is a major troop contributor to UN peacekeeping. This operational role advances India’s global credentials and provides practical leverage in multilateral diplomacy; it simultaneously demonstrates the limits of UN action when mandates are unclear or resources insufficient.
- Regional rivalries and Council elections: The Pakistan 2025 case highlights how bilateral rivalries (India–Pakistan) influence perceptions of UNSC legitimacy. India must continue pursuing coalition‑building among General Assembly members and regional blocs while pressing for procedural limits on politicized committee appointments.
- Norms and humanitarian intervention: India’s stance on R2P and on use of force in humanitarian crises is shaped by concerns about sovereignty, selective application of norms, and the potential misuse of intervention for geopolitical ends. The UNSC’s inconsistent record pushes Indian policy towards cautious support for normative evolution, coupled with insistence on consensus and legal clarity.

Conclusion

The Security Council is neither uniformly effective nor uniformly dysfunctional. Empirical studies register important successes—particularly in many peacekeeping and nation‑building contexts—while high‑profile failures in Rwanda, Srebrenica, Darfur and Syria expose deep structural and political weaknesses. The P5 veto, resource shortfalls, and the geopolitics of influence (including election‑related aid dynamics) create endemic constraints. For India, these dynamics shape strategic choices: from pressing for Council reform and a permanent seat, to leveraging UN peacekeeping for influence, to calibrating responses to humanitarian interventions. Understanding the UNSC’s mixed record is therefore indispensable for any serious account of India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### Membership reform

The question of who sits on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) — and with what rights — has been a persistent and defining fault line in the Organization’s governance. Calls for reform are almost as old as the UN Charter itself, yet durable change has proved elusive. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, debates over Council membership illuminate how prestige, power projection, coalition politics and institutional norms intersect with New Delhi’s long-term ambitions.

Historical and institutional context
- The Security Council currently comprises 15 members: five permanent members (the P5 — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) who hold veto power over substantive decisions, and ten non‑permanent members elected to two‑year terms. The veto remains the central structural obstacle to meaningful reform.
- Amending the Charter presents a high legal and political bar. Article 108 requires any amendment to be approved by a two‑thirds majority in the General Assembly and to be ratified by two‑thirds of UN members, a process that must include ratification by each of the P5. Practically, this gives each P5 an effective de facto veto over formal Charter change.
- African representation on the Council — particularly a lack of a permanent seat — is a persistent gap in reform discussions; common African candidates cited include Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa. Regional rivalries (for example, Sino‑Japanese tensions, or India–Pakistan competition) complicate consensus on specific aspirants.

The principal claimants: the G4
- The strongest and most organized campaign for new permanent seats has come from the so‑called G4: Brazil, Germany, India and Japan. The G4 argue that the post‑1945 distribution of permanent membership no longer reflects geopolitical realities and that the Council’s legitimacy requires inclusion of major contemporary powers.
- Japan and Germany invoke their post‑war recovery, sustained economic weight and historically large financial contributions to the UN system. China’s rise as a major funder — now the UN’s second‑largest contributor — has altered the financial calculus of influence.
- Brazil and India buttress their claims with operational contributions: both are among the largest troop contributors to UN peacekeeping missions, a point that aligns material capability with normative claims to greater voice.
- The G4 have sought coalitions and public pledges of support: in 2004 they issued a joint statement backing each other’s claims and indicating support for two additional African seats. In later years the G4 have also signalled pragmatic flexibility; in 2017 they indicated a willingness to accept limits on exercising a veto (for example, temporarily forgoing it) if new permanent status were conceded.

Opposition and alternative proposals: Uniting for Consensus (UfC)
- Countering the G4 is the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) movement, rooted in a coalition led historically by Italy and including Pakistan, Spain, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Turkey, South Korea and others. Italy has been a leading voice of this group and is now among the UN’s larger funders.
- The UfC opposes the creation of additional lifelong permanent seats, arguing that such an expansion would entrench privilege and fail to democratize the Council. As an alternative it proposes "semi‑permanent" seats: longer‑term, renewable non‑permanent seats that would increase continuity without creating new veto‑bearing permanents. This approach preserves the formal two‑category structure of the Council while broadening the pool of states that can serve repeatedly.
- The UfC also addresses the veto through a menu of options, from outright abolition to limiting veto use to Chapter VII matters (i.e., actions in response to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression).

P5 positions and politics
- The P5 are internally divided. The United States has offered important endorsements — historically supportive of Japan and (in several formulations) India — while also preferring incremental additions of non‑permanent seats. The United Kingdom and France have been relatively sympathetic to the G4 (Germany, Brazil, India and Japan) and tend to support stronger African representation. China professes support for stronger developing‑country representation but firmly opposes Japan’s membership; Russia’s positions have been more transactional and issue‑specific.
- Because any Charter amendment ultimately requires the assent or non‑objection of the P5, their stances are decisive. This creates a classic collective action problem: many members agree the Council is flawed (as historian Paul Kennedy observed), but there is no consensus on how to fix it that satisfies the P5 and the competing regional interests.

Snapshots of reform initiatives
- In 2004 Secretary‑General Kofi Annan convened advisers to produce recommendations on UN reform by the end of that year. One prominent 2004 proposal suggested increasing the number of permanent members by five — generally understood as the G4 plus at least one African seat (and perhaps an Arab League seat).
- Proposals have also been advanced in national legislatures and foreign policy fora. For example, U.S. Representatives Ami Bera and Frank Pallone introduced a resolution in 2017 (H.Res.535) expressing support for India’s elevation to permanent UNSC membership.
- More recently, geopolitics continued to shape advocacy: at the 2025 BRICS summit in Rio, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi underscored joint ambitions for permanent UNSC membership. Modi framed reform as essential to the Council’s credibility and better representation of the Global South — themes that square with India’s long‑standing narrative of balancing status claims with principled multilateralism. Both leaders placed UNSC reform on the agenda of forthcoming BRICS presidencies, signalling a coordinated diplomatic push.

Alternative structural ideas: sovereignty pooling and regional seats
- Beyond adding individual states to the P5, some reformers advocate structural innovation. The Noble World Foundation (NWF) has proposed shifting seats and veto privileges from individual states to regional organizations that pool sovereignty — the European Union being the primary example. This model echoes existing regional groupings’ practice of coordinating candidacies for non‑permanent seats.
- Proponents point to legal precedents such as the 1964 European Court of Justice ruling (Costa v. ENEL), which established the primacy of EU law over conflicting national law, as an analogue for how pooled sovereignty can function in practice. The NWF argues regional entities could be eligible without formal Charter amendment, by virtue of the General Assembly and Security Council interpreting membership and representation flexibly.
- Such proposals, however, face formidable legal and political challenges. The UN Charter conceives membership and voting rights in terms of states; recognition, representation and the mechanics of exercising veto authority by a non‑state actor would require complex institutional reworking and broad political acceptance.

Practical obstacles and the durable status quo
- The politics of reform demand concurrent support from broad regional coalitions and key P5 members. Regional rivalries — for instance, Pakistan’s opposition to India’s bid, or China’s opposition to Japan — make simple majorities in the General Assembly politically insufficient for a stable settlement.
- Semi‑permanent seats remain an attractive compromise for some: they expand continuity and representation while avoiding the creation of additional veto holders. Yet they do not satisfy states seeking the permanence and prestige of full permanent membership.
- In short, while there is widespread recognition — echoed in academic and policy circles — that the Council’s composition is anachronistic, the combination of legal hurdles (Charter amendment), veto politics, competing regional claims and the necessity of P5 acquiescence makes substantive change unusually hard.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s UNSC campaign is a lens on its broader strategic trajectory. Permanent membership speaks to status, diplomatic reach and the capacity to shape international security norms — all central elements of India’s strategic culture, which prizes autonomy, moral legitimacy and multilateral engagement.
- Practically, a permanent seat would afford India a formal role in shaping decisions that affect its security environment, from sanctions regimes to authorizations of force. India’s long contributions to peacekeeping and its growing diplomatic heft underpin its normative claim: that capability and responsibility justify greater authority.
- Yet India’s approach has balanced ambition with caution. It has been willing at times to accept constraints (e.g., the G4’s willingness to consider temporary limits on veto use) as part of a negotiated settlement, reflecting New Delhi’s preference for incremental, institutionally embedded gains rather than unilateral status assertions.
- Finally, India’s engagement in coalitions (G4, BRICS outreach, African diplomacy) illustrates a core strategic habit: securing influence through networked partnerships that can alter the arithmetic of General Assembly politics even when the P5 remain reluctant to cede privilege.

Conclusion
Reforming Security Council membership remains a study in constrained multilateralism. The competing logics of legitimacy, regional balance, legal formality and great‑power privilege produce a stalemate: consensus on the problem, but no durable consensus on remedy. For India, the struggle for a permanent seat is both a reflection of its rising material and normative claims and a test of its capacity to translate long‑term strategic ambitions into institutional change within a system designed to resist rapid transformation.
