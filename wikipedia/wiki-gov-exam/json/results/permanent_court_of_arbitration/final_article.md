# Permanent Court of Arbitration — Introduction

Article marked for update (February 2025). See final section for items to verify before publication.

Overview
- The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), based at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands, is an intergovernmental organization that provides institutional and administrative support for international arbitration and other forms of dispute settlement. It is not a standing judicial court in the sense of a permanent bench of judges; rather it supplies registry services, facilities, and procedural frameworks for ad hoc and institutional tribunals constituted to resolve disputes among combinations of States, State entities, international organisations and private parties.

Origins and legal foundation
- The PCA traces its institutional origins to the first Hague Peace Conference (1899), which was convened at the initiative of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia with the explicit purposes of promoting durable peace and restraining an unchecked arms race. The PCA’s formal legal basis is found in two multilateral instruments negotiated at the Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907 concerning the pacific settlement of international disputes. These Conventions created a framework through which States accepted procedures and a registry for arbitration without creating a compulsory judicial body.

Nature and functions
- The PCA’s central function is administrative and facilitative rather than adjudicatory in the sense of a permanent court:
  - It provides registry services and case-administration (filings, scheduling, communication among parties).
  - It assists in constituting tribunals by facilitating appointments of arbitrators and neutrals, and by applying agreed institutional rules.
  - It offers hearing and meeting facilities (notably at the Peace Palace), logistical support, and custodial services for case records and awards.
  - It can administer a wide array of dispute types, including territorial and maritime boundaries, sovereignty claims, human rights questions (where parties consent), investor–State investment disputes, and commercial or trade-related controversies with international dimensions.

Institutional character and membership
- The PCA is constituted through the Hague Conventions rather than as a United Nations specialized agency; nonetheless, it has observer status at the UN (since 1993) and cooperates with UN organs and agencies while retaining institutional independence.
- The Conventions established a list of Contracting Parties. The commonly cited figure in recent years is approximately 125 Contracting Parties, but membership numbers can change and should be verified against the PCA’s official list at the time of publication.

Distinction from the International Court of Justice (ICJ)
- The PCA and the ICJ are distinct in form and function:
  - ICJ: a standing judicial organ of the United Nations with a permanent bench of judges that decides contentious cases between States and issues advisory opinions on legal questions referred by UN organs.
  - PCA: a registry and administrative mechanism that facilitates arbitral tribunals and other ad hoc dispute-resolution bodies; its “members” (often described historically as Members of the Court) are potential arbitrators listed by Contracting Parties but do not constitute a permanent bench issuing binding precedent.

The Peace Palace and symbolic role
- The Peace Palace houses the PCA’s seat and other international legal bodies and has long served as a symbolic centre for international dispute settlement and the rule of law. Its physical presence in The Hague reinforces the PCA’s identity as part of the Hague “cluster” of international courts and tribunals.

Roster and personnel
- The PCA maintains rosters of arbitrators and experts nominated by Contracting Parties. These persons are eligible to serve on tribunals that the PCA administers, but they do not sit as a collective, permanent body issuing decisions. Appointment mechanisms typically reflect party agreement, treaty provisions, or procedural rules administered by the PCA.

Recent trends and evolving practice areas
- Over the past decades the PCA has seen growth and diversification of its caseload:
  - A marked increase in investor–State arbitrations and treaty-based investment disputes where the PCA acts as registry or appointing authority.
  - Frequent administration of maritime and boundary disputes, especially in regions where novel maritime claims and delimitation issues have arisen.
  - Growing involvement of international organisations and private parties alongside States in mixed disputes.
  - Emergent practice areas warrant monitoring—environmental claims, cyberspace-related disputes, and complex transnational regulatory conflicts are increasingly discussed in PCA practice and scholarship.
- The PCA’s procedural services are wide-ranging: administering ad hoc tribunals, facilitating appointment of third-party arbitrators and presiding arbitrators, providing hearing venues and translation services, and maintaining official records and awards.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the PCA matters for several reasons:
  - Forum for dispute settlement: The PCA offers a neutral institutional setting for resolving interstate and investor–State disputes that can have strategic and security dimensions (territorial and maritime delimitation, sovereignty disputes, or disputes implicating critical infrastructure and investments).
  - Legal and normative influence: Use of arbitral mechanisms and international dispute settlement shapes diplomatic behaviour and legalism in Indian strategic practice—opting for arbitration signals a preference for rules-based resolution and can reduce escalation risk.
  - Capacity and practice: India’s legal community, ministries and state-owned enterprises must engage with PCA procedures when Indian interests are party to international arbitrations; mastery of PCA processes affects outcomes and, by extension, economic and security interests.
  - Strategic signalling: Choice of forum (PCA versus bilateral negotiation or neutral courts) can itself be part of India’s signalling toolkit in regional security competition and in managing disputes in the Indian Ocean region.
- These linkages mean that monitoring PCA practice (not only outcomes but also procedural reforms and emerging subject-matter trends) is important for policymakers concerned with India’s external legal posture and the means by which India protects its national security and economic interests through legal dispute settlement.

Update notes and items for verification before final publication
- Membership number of Contracting Parties: the figure of 125 should be checked against the PCA’s official membership list at the time of publication.
- Landmark cases and statistics: identify and summarise recent PCA-administered cases with strategic relevance to India or to regional stability (maritime delimitation, investor–State disputes, inter-State arbitrations).
- Administrative reforms and practice changes: confirm any internal reforms, new procedural rules, or institutional arrangements adopted since 2024 (including digital hearing practices, transparency measures, or roster revisions).
- New practice areas: verify any formal PCA engagement or rules addressing cyber, environmental arbitration, or other emergent domains.

Concluding remark
- The PCA occupies a distinctive institutional niche: a durable, service-oriented mechanism for international arbitration created in the Hague peace movement and adapted to contemporary transnational dispute settlement. For India, the PCA is both a practical instrument and a normative reference point in the architecture of international dispute resolution that intersects with strategic calculations, legal diplomacy and national security considerations.

## The Permanent Court of Arbitration — Organization

Introduction  
The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) occupies a distinctive place in the institutional architecture of international dispute resolution. Created under the Hague Peace Conferences of 1899 and 1907, the PCA is not a conventional standing court with permanent judges deciding cases on its own initiative. Rather, it is an administrative body and a registry that makes available an enduring institutional infrastructure — premises, lists of qualified arbitrators, procedural support and secretariat services — through which states and other parties can constitute ad hoc tribunals, commissions of enquiry, conciliation commissions and similar dispute‑settling mechanisms. This institutional design emphasizes flexibility and party autonomy: the PCA facilitates dispute settlement without imposing a single compulsory forum or fixed procedural template.

Historical and physical seat  
- The PCA’s official seat is the Peace Palace (Vredespaleis) in The Hague, a building purpose‑built to house institutions dedicated to the peaceful settlement of international disputes.  
- Prior to completion of the Peace Palace, the PCA used Prinsegracht 71 in The Hague (a building dating from about 1728) as its seat between 1901 and 1913; notable early arbitrations, including the North Atlantic Fisheries arbitration (1910), took place there.  
- The PCA shares the Peace Palace with the International Court of Justice (ICJ), a proximity that has occasionally caused public confusion between the two institutions.

Nature, mandate and scope of services  
- The PCA’s primary objective is administrative and facilitative: to provide a permanent and readily available registry for international arbitration and related procedures (arbitration, commissions of enquiry, conciliation, fact‑finding, and associated case administration).  
- It administers disputes between States, investor–State arbitrations and disputes involving private parties when the parties choose PCA services. Its value lies in logistical capacity (hearing rooms, court clerks, secure communications), linguistic and research assistance, procedural administration and financial management for constituted tribunals.  
- Unlike the ICJ (the United Nations’ principal judicial organ), the PCA does not render judgments from a fixed bench; tribunals under the PCA are assembled for each dispute according to the parties’ agreement.

Organizational structure — the three organs
The PCA’s internal governance is organized around three principal organs: the Administrative Council, the International Bureau (the Secretariat) and the Members of the Court. Each performs distinct but complementary functions.

1. Administrative Council (Permanent Administrative Council)  
- Composition: the Council is composed of all diplomatic representatives of Contracting Parties who are accredited to the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In practice this comprises ambassadors and heads of mission in The Hague.  
- Presidency: the Council is presided over by the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs (who is also a Contracting Party).  
- Responsibilities: direction and control of the International Bureau; oversight of the organisation’s budget; adoption of administrative regulations; and the periodic reporting of PCA activities. The Council thus exercises managerial and financial supervision while respecting the PCA’s procedural independence in administering cases.

2. International Bureau (Secretariat)  
- The International Bureau is the PCA’s secretariat and is headed by the Secretary‑General.  
- Functions: acts as the registry for arbitrations and other procedures; provides linguistic, legal research, administrative and financial support to tribunals; manages communications, filings and hearing logistics; and implements the Administrative Council’s administrative directives. In short, it operationalizes the PCA’s registry and case‑management functions.

3. Members of the Court  
- Appointment and qualifications: each Contracting Party may appoint up to four persons of known competency in international law, of the highest moral reputation, and willing to accept arbitrator duties. Appointments last six years and are renewable.  
- Role: Members form a roster or panel of potential arbitrators from which parties may choose, although parties are not obliged to select arbitrators solely from this list — a feature that preserves flexibility. Members belonging to the same appointing state constitute a "national group."  
- Special functions of national groups: national groups are entitled to nominate candidates for election to the ICJ; thereby PCA membership is institutionally linked to broader international judicial nomination channels.  
- Additional privileges: Members of the Court (and ICJ judges) are among the select categories of persons entitled to propose candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Procedural flexibility and party autonomy  
- Parties are free to design the composition and procedures of the tribunal that will decide their dispute; they may select arbitrators from the Members’ list or appoint others by agreement. This flexibility makes the PCA attractive where states wish to tailor procedural rules, combine legal and technical expertise, or preserve political sensitivity by avoiding wholly public adjudication.  
- The International Bureau supports these procedures but does not itself adjudicate disputes.

Relationship to the ICJ and the United Nations  
- Distinction from ICJ: although co‑located in the Peace Palace, the PCA is institutionally and functionally distinct from the ICJ. The ICJ is a permanent judicial organ of the United Nations with fixed judges elected to the Court; the PCA provides services for ad hoc tribunals and a broader menu of dispute settlement mechanisms.  
- Relationship to the UN: the PCA is not part of the UN system. It has held observer status in the UN General Assembly since 1993, allowing it to participate in GA sessions in a non‑voting capacity but maintaining institutional independence.

Illustrative arbitrations and hearings (examples)  
- Historical example: North Atlantic Fisheries Arbitration (1910) — an early 20th‑century inter‑state arbitration administered under the PCA during its Prinsegracht 71 era.  
- Modern examples: public hearings staged in PCA facilities include Case No. 2012‑04 (arbitration between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Slovenia) and Case No. 2015‑28 (the Enrica Lexie Incident, Italy v. India), the latter illustrating how maritime and jurisdictional incidents involving states and private actors can engage PCA services. Such hearings demonstrate the PCA’s continuing role as a venue for disputes with political and security implications.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
- Choice of forum and strategic signalling: India’s selection (or avoidance) of fora such as the PCA can itself be part of statecraft. The PCA’s flexible, arbitration‑centric model offers India procedural control, a capacity to limit public exposure, and the option to appoint arbitrators with particular technical or legal expertise — characteristics that may be preferable for cases touching on sensitive national security, jurisdictional or commercial issues.  
- Maritime and jurisdictional disputes: incidents at sea — where questions of sovereign immunity, jurisdiction over nationals, and criminal prosecutions intersect with diplomatic consequences — often lead states to invoke arbitration or commissions of inquiry. The Enrica Lexie case exemplifies how such incidents can be channelled into PCA processes, thereby engaging legal arguments that have knock‑on effects for operational rules, naval rules of engagement and bilateral relations.  
- Institutional linkage to international judicial nomination: through national groups the PCA constitutes a formal channel by which India (as a Contracting Party) can influence nominations to the ICJ, thereby connecting the country’s engagement with the PCA to longer‑term strategic interests in shaping international adjudicative capacity.

Conclusion  
The Permanent Court of Arbitration is best understood as an enduring administrative and registry institution that enables tailored, party‑driven dispute resolution across a wide range of international controversies. Its three organs — the Administrative Council, the International Bureau and the Members of the Court — together sustain an infrastructure that preserves party autonomy while ensuring procedural integrity and logistical support. The PCA’s independence from the UN, its shared physical proximity with the ICJ, and its historic lineage from the Hague Conferences make it a unique and enduring resource for states, including India, seeking legal and quasi‑judicial means to manage interstate, maritime, investor–state and other transnational disputes.

## Procedure

The procedural architecture of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is rooted in the Hague Convention of 1899. Articles 30–57 of that Convention establish the primary rules governing arbitration under the PCA’s auspices. These provisions are neither novel nor improvisational; rather, they adapt and systematize procedural practices drawn from earlier bilateral and multilateral treaties between states, creating a relatively uniform framework for interstate arbitration at the turn of the twentieth century.

Historical development
- The 1899 rules (arts. 30–57) codified procedures adapted from prior treaties and ad hoc practice among states.
- In 1907 the substantive procedural rules were amended. The most conspicuous innovation introduced then was a summary (expedited) procedure tailored for straightforward disputes. This expedited track reduced the formality and duration of proceedings in suitable cases.
- The procedural refinements of 1907 exerted notable influence on later institutional arrangements: they helped shape the drafting of inter-state adjudicative procedures in the 1920s, including those that informed the eventual rules of the Permanent Court of International Justice and, by extension, later international judicial practice.

Jurisdictional opening: the compromis
- The first formal act that brings a dispute under the PCA is the submission of a compromis — an arbitration agreement in which the parties define the subject-matter, the questions to be decided, and the tribunal’s competence.
- The compromis performs two critical functions: it activates the PCA procedures and delimits the tribunal’s jurisdiction (the legal and factual perimeter within which arbitrators may operate).

Phases of proceedings
- PCA arbitrations typically proceed in two main phases:
  1. Written pleadings: parties exchange written memorials, counter-memorials and supporting documents. These pleadings create the factual and legal record that frames the controversy.
  2. Oral discussion: an oral phase in which parties present argument, examine witnesses or experts, and respond to arbitrators’ questions.
- After oral argument, the tribunal retires to deliberate and formulate its decision.

Decision-making, publication and dissent
- Decisions are adopted by a simple majority of the arbitrators unless the compromis or applicable rules stipulate otherwise. The reliance on a simple majority contrasts with bodies that require unanimity or qualified majorities, and it emphasizes practicality and finality in interstate arbitration.
- The tribunal issues its decision as an award. The award is binding on the parties to the compromis.
- Dissenting opinions are published alongside the award. The practice of publishing dissents increases transparency, illuminates alternative legal reasoning, and contributes to the development of international jurisprudence by recording minority approaches.
- Historically, early awards were countersigned by the arbitrators themselves. The 1907 amendments centralized this administrative act: countersigning responsibility was transferred to the president and the secretary of the PCA. This change professionalized and institutionalized administrative accountability for awards.
- Awards are read in public session, attended by the parties’ agents and counsel, enhancing procedural visibility and state-level legitimacy of the process.

Finality and enforcement
- PCA awards are final between the parties; there is no general mechanism for appeal within the PCA framework.
- The absence of appellate review places heightened importance on the award’s persuasiveness and on the parties’ readiness to comply voluntarily. Enforcement therefore depends on state compliance and on the broader suite of diplomatic, political and reputational tools that states may employ to secure implementation.

Institutional character and normative influence
- The PCA functions as an intergovernmental organization that facilitates ad hoc tribunals; arbitrators are generally appointed for each case rather than being permanent judges on a standing bench. This flexibility allows states to tailor composition and expertise to the dispute.
- The PCA’s procedural rules and practices have had a formative role in the evolution of international adjudicative norms and helped shape later institutions such as the Permanent Court of International Justice and the International Court of Justice.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Predictability and timeframe: The PCA’s structured written-then-oral process and its summary procedure option provide states with predictable timelines and the possibility of expedited resolution in straightforward matters. For Indian strategists, this makes arbitration an instrument that can resolve discrete legal questions without indefinite delay—an attractive feature when time-sensitive security or economic interests are involved.
- Jurisdictional clarity and state control: The compromis mechanism gives states strong control over the tribunal’s jurisdiction. For India, which is cautious about ceding legal authority in sensitive security domains, the ability to define scope precisely is important when contemplating third-party dispute settlement.
- Finality and compliance calculus: The PCA’s lack of an appeal route makes awards legally final; consequently, India’s decision to arbitrate involves a calculated acceptance of finality and reliance on political, economic and reputational levers to secure compliance. This affects India’s willingness to litigate politically salient disputes where enforcement risks are high.
- Selection and expertise: The practice of appointing arbitrators per case allows India to ensure appropriate expertise (e.g., maritime law, boundary delimitation, investment disputes) and to select arbitrators who understand its strategic context—important when legal determinations have broader security or economic consequences.
- Transparency and precedent: The publication of awards and dissenting opinions contributes to the formation of international legal precedent. India can derive normative and persuasive value from favorable awards and from reasoned dissents that align with its strategic-legal positions, thereby enhancing its international standing without resort to coercion.
- Institutional influence: Given the PCA’s historical role in shaping international adjudicative procedure, Indian engagement with PCA processes is also a form of participation in evolving international legal norms—an avenue for aligning procedural practice with India’s broader strategic and normative preferences.

In sum, the PCA’s procedural design — its written and oral phases, the compromis as jurisdictional gate, the availability of summary procedure, the finality of awards, and the institutional practices surrounding publication and countersigning — creates a predictable, state-centered arbitration mechanism. For states like India, the PCA offers both tools and constraints that must be weighed carefully within the calculus of strategic culture and national security policy.

### The Permanent Court of Arbitration: budget, cost-allocation and implications for Indian strategy

Between 2007 and 2008 the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) operated on a modest institutional budget — officially reported at approximately €1.8 million for that biennium. This figure is useful as a historical benchmark of the institution’s scale, but it must be read as a snapshot rather than a guide to present-day finances: readers and practitioners should consult the PCA’s annual reports for current budgetary numbers and trends.

Funding model and revenue sources
- The PCA is financed through a mixed model: (a) assessed contributions from Contracting Parties (its member states) and (b) income derived from services rendered in specific cases (principally arbitration and other dispute‑resolution proceedings).
- Contracting-Party contributions are apportioned using a distribution system modeled on the Universal Postal Union (UPU) scale — a standardized apportionment mechanism designed to reflect states’ fiscal capacity and provides a predictable, tiered basis for assessment rather than an equal-per-state charge.

Allocation of costs for arbitration proceedings
- Parties to a dispute bear the expenses of the arbitral tribunal constituted to decide their case. This is the default allocation rule: the users of the process pay the direct costs of the adjudicatory function.
- Typical direct cost items borne by the parties include:
  - fees and remuneration of arbitrators;
  - registry services directly linked to the case (case-file management, administrative processing);
  - administrative expenses attendant on hearings (hearing-room costs, transcription, translation and interpretation when required).
- Explicitly excluded from tribunal expenses is the PCA’s organizational overhead. Rent, core secretariat salaries, long-term institutional programmes and other fixed institutional costs are not charged to individual cases; these are covered by Contracting Party contributions. This separation preserves institutional stability and prevents cases with large budgets from implicitly subsidising the institution’s ongoing fixed costs.

Variability of case costs and the PCA’s procedural flexibility
- Arbitration costs are highly case-specific. Determinants that drive cost escalation include:
  - the number and seniority of arbitrators (three arbitrators vs. sole arbitrator; chair remunerations);
  - complexity of the legal and factual issues;
  - need for expert witnesses, extensive document production and e-discovery;
  - length and number of hearings; and
  - language, translation and security requirements.
- Recognising the heterogeneity of disputes, the PCA and disputing parties can negotiate alternative fee arrangements. These negotiated solutions may take the form of:
  - caps on arbitrators’ fees or overall tribunal costs;
  - staged payment schedules to ease cash‑flow pressures on one party;
  - cost‑sharing agreements between parties; or
  - bespoke arrangements reflecting the parties’ particular needs (for example, reduced registry support in ad hoc or expedited procedures).
- Procedural predictability is enhanced by a small set of published standard charges. One commonly cited fixed charge is a base fee of €3,000 when the PCA acts as appointing authority. This fixed element provides a predictable, published cost for that discrete PCA function, though it is strictly a base and does not replace the many other possible charges connected with tribunal establishment and conduct.

PCA roles: registry, appointing authority, and implications for fees
- The PCA acts in multiple roles: as an independent registry providing administrative services; and sometimes — under parties’ agreement or under treaty rules — as an appointing authority that selects arbitrators. Each role has distinct cost implications. When acting as appointing authority, the PCA’s published €3,000 fee is an identifiable, routine cost element; additional tribunal fees, arbitrator remuneration and case-related expenses are charged separately.
- The institutional design — separating overhead funding from case billing and maintaining published base fees for certain functions — enhances transparency and makes participation in PCA procedures more foreseeable.

Relevance and policy implications for India
- For India, a frequent litigant and occasional user of multilateral dispute mechanisms, the PCA’s funding and fee architecture has practical consequences for national defence, foreign policy and legal-strategic planning:
  - Budgetary predictability: the existence of published base fees and the separation of overheads allow Indian policymakers and litigators to forecast minimum administrative costs when assessing dispute‑settlement options.
  - Cost management: because arbitration costs are case-dependent, ministries should build contingency estimates that account for tribunal composition and potential expert/witness costs. Where possible, India can negotiate fee arrangements (caps, phased payments) especially in interstate disputes to manage fiscal exposure.
  - Access and equity considerations: smaller states or ministries with constrained budgets should be aware that contracting‑party contributions underwrite PCA overheads, but direct case costs remain the responsibility of users — underscoring the importance of cost-sharing and early procedural decisions to contain expenses.
  - Strategic use of PCA roles: when impartial appointment of arbitrators is important, the PCA’s appointing-authority function — and its modest published fee — is a predictable tool. Conversely, parties that wish to minimise administrative friction might agree to appointing mechanisms that reduce PCA involvement (and thus avoid even routine fees).

Concluding note
The PCA’s mixed funding model — member-state contributions (apportioned on a UPU-style scale) coupled with user fees — creates an institutional balance: it preserves a stable institutional base while charging parties for the discrete costs they generate. For Indian strategic planners and legal advisers, the key takeaways are predictability (published base fees like the €3,000 appointing-authority fee), the need to budget for variable tribunal costs, and the availability of negotiated fee arrangements to manage fiscal exposure in interstate or investor-state proceedings.

### The Permanent Court of Arbitration: membership, numeric reconciliation, and implications for India

Background and origin  
The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) traces its origins to the great multilateral diplomatic initiatives of the turn of the twentieth century. It was created by the Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes (1899) and supplemented by follow-up instruments adopted at The Hague in 1907. These early Hague Conventions established a legal and institutional architecture intended to provide states with standing procedures and a roster of arbitrators to resolve inter‑state disputes peacefully — an architecture that endures today in the PCA.

Membership: the headline figures and their reconciliation  
Contemporary descriptions of PCA membership often cite several overlapping treaty bases. The core numerical claims that require careful unpacking are:

- The 1899 Hague Convention has 71 state parties; states party to the 1899 Convention are thereby parties to the PCA.  
- The 1907 Hague follow‑up convention has 101 state parties; these states likewise become parties to the PCA by virtue of that instrument.  
- There is an overlap of 52 states that are parties to both the 1899 and 1907 Conventions.  
- A commonly reported aggregate is that the PCA has 125 Contracting Parties. Of those 125, 123 are United Nations member states and two are not full UN members (identified here as Kosovo and Palestine).

A simple arithmetic check illuminates why this composite account needs qualification: 71 + 101 = 172; subtracting the 52 overlapping parties yields 120 distinct states that are PCA parties on the basis of the two Hague Conventions alone. The stated total of 125 therefore implies that five additional states have become Contracting Parties by other means — namely, by later accession to the PCA Statute without being parties to either of the 1899 or 1907 Conventions. In short, PCA membership is cumulative and may be effected either through the original Hague Conventions or by subsequent accession instruments.

What “Contracting Party” means in practice  
Being a “Contracting Party” to the PCA denotes that a state has accepted the PCA Statute and thereby acquires a set of formal rights and responsibilities in relation to PCA procedures. Practically, this includes the capacity to:

- invoke PCA arbitration and other dispute‑settlement procedures;  
- nominate persons to the PCA’s rosters of arbitrators and conciliators; and  
- participate in institutional governance measures and records relevant to the PCA’s workings.

Because the PCA’s statutory architecture predates the modern United Nations system, its membership rules are not coterminous with UN membership. This explains why two entities that are not full UN members — here noted as Kosovo (a partially recognized state) and Palestine (a UN observer state) — can figure as Contracting Parties. Their inclusion underscores a particular institutional openness: the PCA’s modalities permit accession by entities that are not full UN members, subject to the PCA’s formal acceptance procedures.

Why consult primary sources (and where to look)  
Given the overlapping treaty bases, successive accessions, and the occasional ambiguity in secondary summaries, precise membership status and accession dates are best verified from the PCA’s official list of Contracting Parties and the PCA’s annual reports. Those primary sources will resolve the identity of the five additional accessions implied by the arithmetic above and provide the authoritative accession instruments and dates.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
For a book concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security choices, the PCA’s membership architecture and practical role in interstate dispute settlement have several instructive implications:

- Institutional preference for arbitration: PCA membership situates India within a long‑standing multilateral framework that institutionalizes arbitration as a legitimate means of interstate dispute resolution. This institutional anchoring can moderate preferences for unilateral or purely coercive responses in certain dispute contexts, especially those amenable to legal adjudication (e.g., boundary, investment, and maritime disputes).  
- Sovereignty and selective engagement: India’s strategic culture prizes sovereignty and strategic autonomy. The manner in which PCA membership is exercised — selectively invoking arbitration where it serves national interests and declining it where it does not — reflects a broader Indian pattern of pragmatic multilateralism. The PCA thus becomes one tool among many, usable when legal clarity and international legitimacy are priorities.  
- Non‑UN members and normative reach: The fact that the PCA includes non‑UN members highlights the Court’s potential utility in complex regional settings where recognition politics complicate other multilateral mechanisms. For India, which operates in a neighbourhood with varied statehood and recognition issues, this procedural openness can be both an asset and a caution: an asset when legal avenues are advantageous; a caution because outcomes remain contingent on broader geostrategic calculations.  
- Practical ramifications for capacity building: Effective use of PCA mechanisms presupposes legal and institutional capacity — well‑developed legal teams, rosters of arbitrators, and institutional memory. India’s engagement with the PCA therefore implicates defense diplomacy, legal education, and interagency coordination within national security practice.

Concluding note  
The PCA is a hybrid of old‑style multilateral treaty law and living institutional practice. Understanding its membership mechanics — the interplay of the 1899 and 1907 Hague Conventions, subsequent accessions, and the presence of non‑UN actors — is essential for any sober evaluation of how legal dispute‑settlement mechanisms fit into India’s broader strategic toolkit. For precise, up‑to‑date membership lists and accession histories, consult the PCA’s official website and its annual reports.

### History

The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) occupies a singular place in the architecture of international dispute settlement. Founded at the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, it is widely regarded as the oldest continuing institution created expressly to facilitate the peaceful resolution of international disputes. Its institutional foundations were laid in Articles 20–29 of the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, which together provided for the establishment of an international registry and the machinery necessary to administer arbitration and conciliation between international actors.

A second Hague Peace Conference convened in 1907 and produced a revised instrument—the 1907 Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes—which replaced and elaborated upon the 1899 text. The two Peace Conferences themselves were notable political events of the era, convened at the personal initiative of Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Nicholas’s declared aims were soberly legalistic and reformist: to discover objective, institutional means to secure “a real and lasting peace” and to constrain the progressive development of armaments. These twin ambitions—legalization of interstate dispute settlement and early efforts at arms limitation—capture the normative aspirations of late nineteenth/early twentieth-century internationalism and provide important context for the PCA’s raison d’être.

Institutionally, the PCA differs markedly from later international courts. Rather than constituting a permanent bench of judges, it was designed as an administrative framework: a registry and set of procedural rules that assist parties in constituting tribunals for arbitration or conciliation. Under the Hague Conventions and subsequent practice, disputing parties appoint arbitrators to form ad hoc tribunals; the PCA supplies administrative support, facilities in The Hague (its seat), and a procedural infrastructure to manage cases. Over time, the Convention texts and the PCA’s own rules have been elaborated through practice and supplementary instruments, creating a flexible but durable institutional model.

The PCA’s jurisdictional competence was conceived broadly. While primarily a forum for inter‑state arbitration, it was constructed to administer disputes involving states, state entities, intergovernmental organizations, and—under certain conditions—private parties. This breadth has allowed the PCA to adapt to the changing composition of international actors across the twentieth and twenty‑first centuries.

Historically and doctrinally, the PCA predated both the League of Nations and the United Nations and exercised a formative influence on subsequent international dispute‑settlement institutions, most notably the International Court of Justice. Elements of the PCA’s registry model, procedural variety (arbitration, conciliation, other forms of dispute settlement), and emphasis on party autonomy helped shape later institutional designs for adjudication and administration in international law.

For students of strategic culture and national security policy—India included—the PCA’s foundation is consequential beyond institutional trivia. The Court’s creation embodied an early turn toward legalized mechanisms for managing interstate conflict and constraining armaments—norms that would later inform international law frameworks within which post‑colonial states, including India, have navigated security dilemmas. The PCA’s continuing role as a flexible administrator of arbitration and conciliation offers states an alternative to coercive or purely political modes of dispute resolution, reinforcing a pattern of legal recourse that has become part of the repertoire of modern diplomatic and security strategy.

### The Permanent Court of Arbitration: Secretaries‑General (Chronological List and Institutional Significance)

The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), established at The Hague by the 1899 Hague Peace Conference, has sustained an administrative core—the Registry—whose leadership is embodied in the office of Secretary‑General. The Secretary‑General provides executive direction of the Registry, manages the PCA’s administrative affairs, and supports the institution’s central functions: the administration of arbitration and conciliation proceedings, maintenance of archives and procedural rules, and engagement with member states and users of the PCA’s services. The office is filled by election by the PCA Administrative Council, the PCA’s primary governing body, and in contemporary practice is appointed for a fixed term (for example, the incumbent’s current term is five years).

The following chronological list records all Secretaries‑General from the institution’s earliest years to the present. The list both demonstrates the PCA’s institutional continuity since its foundation and illustrates changing patterns in tenure length, professional background and, by implication, administrative culture.

Chronological list of Secretaries‑General

Patterns and institutional implications
- Longevity and continuity: Early Secretaries‑General often served long tenures (notably 1905–1929 and 1929–1947). These extended terms conferred stability during the PCA’s formative period and through major international disruptions (World Wars and interwar diplomacy).  
- Modern fixed terms: Recent appointments show a move toward fixed multi‑year terms (e.g., the incumbent’s five‑year term). This reflects modern governance practices that balance continuity with periodic leadership renewal.  
- Diversity of backgrounds: Titles and honorifics (Baron, Jonkheer, Prof., Dr.) indicate a blend of aristocratic, academic and professional legal backgrounds among incumbents. Such diversity has shaped Secretariat culture: scholarly legal expertise, diplomatic sensibilities, and professional administration all feature in the office’s character.  
- Administrative function and state confidence: The Secretary‑General’s effective administration of the Registry is central to user confidence in the PCA as a neutral forum. For states—India among them—stable, professional Registry leadership supports predictable case administration, roster management (of arbitrators and conciliators) and the institutional capacity to handle complex interstate or investor‑state matters.

Relevance for India’s strategic and legal posture
- The PCA is a forum in which India may participate directly or indirectly (inter‑state cases, third‑party appearances, or as a seat/administrator in diplomatic/legal disputes). Understanding who leads the Registry, and the institutional norms they sustain, matters for states weighing recourse to arbitration and conciliation as tools of their strategic and legal policy. Consistent Secretariat leadership reinforces the PCA’s capacity to offer timely case management and technical support—factors that influence a state’s strategic calculations about dispute resolution venues.

## The Permanent Court of Arbitration: Bases of Jurisdiction and Practical Significance for Indian Strategy

Concise summary  
The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) constitutes ad hoc tribunals to resolve international disputes when states or other parties have accepted an appropriate legal basis — principally the Hague Conventions that created the PCA and the many bilateral or multilateral treaties that refer disputes to PCA administration. Where procedural instruments anticipate an appointing authority, or where parties or nominating authorities fail to act, the PCA Secretary‑General can step in as a default appointing authority to ensure tribunals are constituted and proceedings proceed.

Legal bases of jurisdiction

- Founding instruments: The PCA’s institutional existence and basic functions are grounded in the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 (the Conventions on the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes). Those instruments established a framework by which states may submit disputes to arbitration or conciliation and created the PCA as an intergovernmental organization and registry.
- Treaty‑based jurisdiction: In practice most PCA tribunals derive their authority not directly from the PCA Conventions alone but from specific treaty clauses, special agreements (compromis), or arbitration clauses that incorporate the PCA (or permit PCA administration). Such bilateral or multilateral instruments may be boundary treaties, maritime or UNCLOS‑related clauses, investment treaties, or other agreements specifying arbitration or conciliation.
- Consent and the ad hoc tribunal: Crucially, PCA jurisdiction is consensual. The PCA does not possess compulsory jurisdiction; tribunals are constituted ad hoc for each dispute because the PCA has no permanent bench of judges. Parties must therefore point to an accepted legal basis — treaty provision, compromis, or an agreed reference to the Hague Conventions — before a PCA tribunal can lawfully decide the merits.

The PCA Secretary‑General as appointing authority

- Default appointing role: Many institutional rules and treaties anticipate the need for an appointing authority to fill vacancies, resolve deadlocks, or make appointments where party‑nominating bodies fail to act. The PCA Secretary‑General commonly serves in that capacity. This role is procedural and functional rather than judicial — it is intended to prevent stalemate and enable constitution of a tribunal.
- Practical effect: When the Secretary‑General acts as appointing authority, she or he will select arbitrators or take specified appointment steps in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules and the treaty or compromis. This mechanism preserves the integrity and timeliness of arbitration, while courts or parties can subsequently challenge appointments only on limited legal grounds (e.g., lack of independence or lack of jurisdiction).

Functions and limits of the PCA

- Administrative and registry services: The PCA provides registry support, facilities, administrative services and logistical arrangements for hearings, document management, and service of process. It supports a wide variety of dispute types: inter‑state, state‑entity, and investor‑state arbitrations (where the treaty permits PCA administration).
- No permanent tribunal or enforcement arm: Unlike permanent judicial organs, the PCA does not maintain a standing bench; tribunals are ad hoc and tailored to the dispute. The PCA also lacks an enforcement organ — the binding nature of awards depends on party consent and on subsequent enforcement mechanisms in domestic forums or under international instruments (e.g., the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards where applicable).
- Scope variation by instrument: The precise scope of jurisdiction, the procedural rules to be applied, and the appointing authority regime vary by the founding instrument — a boundary treaty can limit issues to delimitation, while an investment treaty may authorize broader claims and different remedies. Understanding the operative text is therefore decisive.

Common treaty frameworks invoking PCA jurisdiction

- Boundary and territorial disputes: Treaties and special agreements between states frequently refer boundary or territorial disputes to PCA‑administered arbitral tribunals.
- Maritime and UNCLOS issues: UNCLOS Annex VII arbitrations are ad hoc but frequently administered by the PCA registry; maritime delimitation and maritime entitlement disputes are a common PCA docket item.
- Investment disputes: Where bilateral investment treaties (BITs) or other investment instruments provide for arbitration but do not limit the administrator, parties may agree on PCA administration (as an alternative to ICSID or ad hoc UNCITRAL rules).

Practical implications — why the exact treaty text matters

- Instrument specificity: The jurisdictional envelope is determined by the specific treaty clause or compromis. Small differences in wording will determine admissibility, remedial scope, whether certain claims can be brought, which rules apply, and what appointing mechanism governs.
- Procedural consequences: The identity of the appointing authority, timetables for constitution, the standard for arbitrator challenges, and the applicable standard of review can all differ depending on the chosen instrument and rules. Parties and states therefore must negotiate careful drafting to preserve strategic options and protect sovereign prerogatives.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

- Legal option set: For a state like India — with maritime interests, boundary questions, and increasing foreign investment flows — the PCA represents an important legal option for peaceful dispute resolution. India's strategic culture, which traditionally favors diplomatic negotiation and bilateralism, nonetheless benefits from preserving credible multilateral legal recourse as part of coercive restraint and reputational management.
- Risk management and signaling: Agreeing to PCA administration can serve as a credible signal of a state’s confidence in legal processes and willingness to abide by rules, which can shape bargaining behavior and regional perceptions. Conversely, India’s choice whether to accept PCA jurisdiction in a given area will reflect calculations about sovereignty, precedent, and strategic autonomy.
- Institutional preparedness: Because PCA jurisdiction hinges on consent and particular treaty wording, Indian policymakers must ensure that treaty drafting, domestic legal capacity, and diplomatic strategy align so that international dispute settlement remains a usable and effective instrument when needed.

Concluding note  
The PCA’s utility lies in its flexible, consensual, and institutionally supported model for constituting arbitral and conciliation tribunals. For states balancing sovereignty, strategic signaling, and dispute management — including India — mastery of the PCA’s jurisdictional bases, the Secretary‑General’s procedural role, and the fine print of treaty clauses is essential to informed policy‑making and the disciplined use of legal avenues in national security affairs.

### Appointment of Arbitrators under the UNCITRAL Rules: the PCA Secretary‑General as Appointing Authority

Context and problem statement  
Under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the parties ordinarily select arbitrators themselves. Two recurring formation problems, however, threaten timely constitution of a tribunal: (1) a party refuses to designate its arbitrator; and (2) the arbitrators designated by the parties cannot agree on the presiding (third) arbitrator. Left unresolved, both scenarios produce delay, procedural uncertainty and often invite intervention by national courts—an outcome many disputing states and commercial parties seek to avoid.

The PCA Secretary‑General as default appointing authority  
To meet these contingencies the UNCITRAL framework contemplates default appointment mechanisms and permits parties to vest an appointing‑authority function in a neutral institutional officer. Practically, the Secretary‑General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) has become a common and readily available option: parties may either (a) include an express clause in their arbitration agreement naming the PCA Secretary‑General as appointing authority, or (b) request the Secretary‑General’s assistance after party‑based selection has broken down. In such cases the Secretary‑General makes appointments necessary to form the tribunal.

Scope and legal and practical effects
- Legal basis: the UNCITRAL Rules themselves supply default appointment mechanisms, while party autonomy allows express designation of an appointing authority (for example, the PCA Secretary‑General). Where so designated or requested, the Secretary‑General performs the appointing‑authority role.  
- Practical effect: PCA appointment avoids recourse to national courts for constituting tribunals, reducing delay and jurisdictional complexity. It supplies a predictable institutional mechanism to ensure that the tribunal is formed even when one party declines to participate in appointments or when party‑appointed arbitrators are deadlocked.  
- Operational limits: appointments by the Secretary‑General remain subject to the applicable law and the procedural rules governing challenges; parties retain the right to raise accepted grounds of challenge to any arbitrator under the UNCITRAL Rules or the applicable national law.

Neutrality and efficiency advantages
- Neutrality: appointing by the PCA Secretary‑General reduces the risk that a tribunal will be perceived as biased because appointments are made by a neutral institutional actor rather than by a court of one party’s domicile or by the opposite party’s nominees. This is a salient consideration in international disputes involving states, state‑owned entities or matters touching national security and sovereign interests.  
- Speed and predictability: administrative appointment by the Secretary‑General generally speeds tribunal constitution compared with litigating the right of appointment before national courts. That said, there are administrative fees associated with PCA involvement; the parties should weigh those costs against the delay and uncertainty that court proceedings typically entail.

Empirical indication of reliance on the PCA  
The practical reliance on the PCA Secretary‑General is significant: between 2011 and 2015 the Secretary‑General received 257 requests to act as appointing authority. That frequency signals widespread acceptance of the PCA role as an effective default mechanism for overcoming appointment stalemates.

Considerations and recommendations (relevance for Indian practice)  
- Drafting clarity: to avoid ambiguity, Indian state entities and commercial parties should specify an appointing authority in their arbitration clauses—naming the PCA Secretary‑General is a clear, neutral option.  
- Strategic fit with national security concerns: when disputes touch on strategic or sensitive national‑security matters, a neutral appointing authority helps preserve perceptions of impartiality and can protect against the adversarial optics of foreign court intervention. At the same time, parties and states should assess confidentiality, challenge risks and any domestic public‑law constraints on arbitration of certain disputes.  
- Challenge and enforcement posture: even where the PCA Secretary‑General appoints arbitrators, appointments can be challenged under applicable law; Indian practitioners should plan procedural strategy accordingly, including timely challenge‑management and consideration of applicable curial law.

Conclusion  
The appointing‑authority function of the PCA Secretary‑General plays a critical enabling role within the UNCITRAL regime: it ensures tribunal formation when party‑based choice fails, offers neutrality and procedural efficiency, and is sufficiently trusted to have been invoked hundreds of times in recent years. For Indian actors involved in international arbitration, explicit clause drafting and an informed balance of cost, speed and challenge‑risks will maximize the institutional and strategic benefits of naming the PCA Secretary‑General as appointing authority.

### Interstate Arbitration under the Permanent Court of Arbitration: constituting a five‑member tribunal

Concise statement
- When two PCA member states agree to submit an interstate dispute to arbitration under the PCA framework, the standard model is a five‑member tribunal: each state appoints two arbitrators (one of whom may be a national of the appointing state), and those four arbitrators together select a fifth arbitrator who serves as the presiding or chair arbitrator.

Key elements and legal foundations
- Institutional basis: This procedure is grounded in the Hague diplomatic tradition and the PCA’s rules governing interstate arbitration. The PCA (established at the Hague by the peace conferences) provides both the institutional home and procedural rules that implement states’ consensual commitments to arbitrate.
- Consent as the sine qua non: Arbitration under the PCA is wholly consensual. The Court cannot impose its jurisdiction; both states must agree either by prior treaty clause, special agreement (compromis), or subsequent consent to submit the particular dispute to a PCA tribunal.
- Tribunal size and composition: The default composition for many interstate PCA arbitrations is five arbitrators:
  - Each party appoints two arbitrators.
  - Of the two arbitrators appointed by a party, one may be a national of that party.
  - The four party-appointed arbitrators jointly select the fifth arbitrator, who becomes the presiding arbitrator (chair) of the tribunal.
- Parity principle: The allocation of two seats to each party institutionalizes parity between sovereign litigants, while the jointly chosen presiding arbitrator is intended to provide a neutral (or mutually acceptable) centrepiece to the tribunal’s decision‑making.

Practical safeguards and administrative backstops
- Filling vacancies and deadlocks: The PCA’s rules include administrative mechanisms to address failures to appoint arbitrators or to select the presiding arbitrator. Where parties or the four arbitrators cannot agree, the PCA as an institution has procedures to make appointments so that arbitration proceeds rather than founder on procedural impasse.
- Nationality and independence: Allowing one appointee per party to be a national is a deliberate compromise. It preserves each state’s ability to have a familiar legal mind on the bench while relying on international norms of arbitrator independence and impartiality to limit bias. In practice, parties often select distinguished jurists with reputations for autonomy and professionalism to reduce challenges to award legitimacy.

Functional role of the presiding arbitrator
- Procedural leadership: The fifth arbitrator, as presiding arbitrator, typically steers procedural matters, manages deliberations, and represents the tribunal in communications with the parties and the PCA registry.
- Decision dynamics: While international arbitrators aim for collegiality, the presiding arbitrator frequently plays a decisive role in shaping the tribunal’s agenda, framing issues for decision, and breaking deadlocks in administrative or procedural votes.

Legal effect and enforcement
- Finality and binding character: Awards rendered by PCA interstate tribunals are binding on the parties who consented to the arbitration. As with other forms of international adjudication, compliance depends primarily on states’ respect for legal commitments and on diplomatic, political, and reputational pressures; there is no centralized global enforcement comparable to domestic execution systems.
- Distinctiveness from other models: The five‑member PCA model contrasts with ad hoc or treaty arbitral procedures that use three‑member panels (e.g., one arbitrator appointed by each party and a presiding arbitrator appointed by agreement or by an appointing authority). The larger bench and structured parity in the PCA model reflect particular interstate concerns about balance, representation, and legitimacy.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Instrument of statecraft: For a rising power like India, the PCA model offers a predictable, state‑centric route to peaceful dispute resolution that preserves sovereign equality while allowing India to sit on equal footing with another state in the tribunal’s composition.
- Choices about representation and strategy: India’s selection of arbitrators — including whether to appoint Indian nationals — is both legal and strategic. Appointing a national can signal confidence in domestic juristic capacity and ensure that Indian perspectives are fully articulated; appointing well‑regarded non‑nationals can bolster perceptions of neutrality and enhance enforceability by reducing claims of bias.
- Managing political and security sensitivities: Because PCA arbitration is consensual, India must weigh the political and security ramifications of consenting to arbitration (or of insisting on non‑judicial solutions). Where disputes touch on sensitive national‑security or sovereignty matters, consent might be withheld; where India seeks legal clarification of obligations (e.g., maritime delimitation, treaty interpretation), PCA arbitration can lend legal finality and international legitimacy.
- Institutional posture and credibility: India’s consistent use of well‑credentialed, independent arbitrators and its demonstrated willingness to comply with awards would strengthen its reputation as a rule‑respecting power — an important element of its strategic culture that affects bargaining leverage, alliance calculus, and perceptions in forums from the neighbourhood to multilateral institutions.

Conclusion
- The five‑member PCA tribunal model balances state equality and procedural neutrality through parity in appointments and a jointly chosen presiding arbitrator. Its reliance on consent, administrative backstops, and norms of arbitrator independence make it a pragmatic mechanism for interstate dispute settlement. For India, the model is both a tool and a signal: a tool to resolve legal disputes peacefully and a signal of how the state positions itself within the international legal order in pursuit of strategic ends.

### Maritime Dispute Settlement under UNCLOS: Options, Defaults and Practical Administration

UNCLOS not only codified states’ maritime rights and zones; it also established a compulsory dispute‑settlement architecture to govern how coastal states resolve disagreements about maritime boundaries, continental shelf limits and other law‑of‑the‑sea issues. The legal pivot for state choice of forum is Article 287, which permits states parties to declare, at the time of ratification or subsequently, their preferred forum for the settlement of disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Convention. That choice determines the procedural pathway available when disputes arise — but it does not eliminate all uncertainty, because different states may elect different forums. The Convention therefore provides both distinct adjudicatory routes and a mechanism to resolve conflicts of procedure in practice.

Available forums and their character

- International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). A specialized tribunal created by UNCLOS and seated in Hamburg, ITLOS hears a wide range of law‑of‑the‑sea disputes and has institutional continuity (permanent judges, registry, rules of procedure) tailored to the Convention’s subject matter. Its specialization gives it technical and jurisprudential advantages in maritime cases.

- International Court of Justice (ICJ). The ICJ is the United Nations’ principal judicial organ and a general international court. It can adjudicate maritime disputes between consenting states and brings to bear broad public‑international law experience and a highly visible jurisprudence. Access to the ICJ depends on states’ consent, which may be given through Article 287 declarations or by special agreement.

- Annex VII arbitral tribunals. Annex VII provides for ad hoc arbitration: when states have not agreed on another forum, a tribunal constituted under Annex VII can be convened for compulsory settlement of disputes (subject to Article 287 choices). These arbitrations are ad hoc (tribunal membership is assembled for each case), but they mirror conventional arbitration procedures and produce legally binding awards.

- Annex VIII special arbitration. Annex VIII establishes procedures for “special arbitration” applicable to certain categories of disputes specified in Annexes I–VII of the Convention (for example, matters requiring the determination of maritime delimitation in particular contexts). Special arbitration has procedural features designed for those subject‑matter categories and, like Annex VII, results in a binding decision.

Resolving conflicting forum choices: the “third option”

Article 287 allows states to choose, among available routes, their preferred forum. However, when disputing states have elected different forums, UNCLOS provides a mechanism to resolve this procedural conflict: a so‑called “third option” or default route applies. In practice, this has often meant that, despite divergent Article 287 declarations, the dispute is resolved by arbitration under Annex VII. The Convention’s text and subsequent practice show an intent that disputes should not remain in procedural limbo because of incompatible choices; rather, a route to final settlement must be available.

Practical administration: the role of the Permanent Court of Arbitration

Although Annex VII tribunals are ad hoc, most such arbitrations under UNCLOS have been administered with the assistance of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). The PCA is an intergovernmental organization that provides registry and administrative services for a variety of arbitration and conciliation proceedings; it is not itself a court in the judicial sense. Administratively supporting ad hoc tribunals gives the proceedings institutional continuity (logistical support, case management, facilities for hearings) while preserving the ad hoc character of tribunal composition.

Empirical practice illustrates this administrative pattern: as of August 2016, the PCA had administered 12 of the 13 Annex VII cases initiated by states under UNCLOS. That practice underscores two interlocking realities — the practical preference for arbitration when procedural choices diverge, and the PCA’s role as the convenient and experienced registry body for such arbitration, even in contexts where UNCLOS envisaged ad hoc procedures.

Binding character and enforcement

Decisions rendered by ITLOS, the ICJ, Annex VII arbitral tribunals and Annex VIII special arbitrations are binding on the parties. Yet bindingness in international adjudication is not identical to domestic enforceability: compliance primarily depends on the parties’ acceptance of the decision and on customary and political enforcement mechanisms (diplomatic pressure, reputational costs, possible recourse to the UN system). The effectiveness of these mechanisms varies with the strategic stakes, domestic politics and broader interstate relations involved.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

For a state like India, whose strategic culture emphasizes sovereignty, careful preservation of diplomatic space and a preference for bilateral negotiation on sensitive territorial issues, UNCLOS’s menu of compulsory procedures presents both opportunities and constraints. On one hand, the availability of specialized fora (ITLOS) and well‑tested arbitral routes (Annex VII with PCA administration) offers legally robust means to secure maritime entitlements against competing claims. On the other hand, reliance on adjudication requires political willingness to submit disputes to a third party and to accept binding decisions — a step that carries domestic and geopolitical costs. Consequently, India’s choices under Article 287 and its operational approach to maritime disputes reflect a balance between the legal certainty that adjudication can provide and the strategic calculus of preserving bilateral bargaining space and national policy autonomy.

Concluding note

UNCLOS created a sophisticated, multilayered dispute‑settlement system that combines specialized and generalist judicial fora with ad hoc arbitration mechanisms. The Convention’s structures, together with the practical role played by institutions such as the PCA, mean that procedural deadlocks are often resolved through arbitration, producing binding outcomes. For states engaged in maritime competition, including India, understanding these options — and the institutional realities of how they are administered and enforced — is essential to crafting sound maritime and security policy.

### Investor–State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), Arbitration and the Permanent Court of Arbitration — implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses are a common feature of many free‑trade and investment treaties. They create a direct route by which private foreign investors may bring claims against sovereign states for alleged breaches of treaty obligations (for example, expropriation, discriminatory treatment, or failure to accord fair and equitable treatment). Because ISDS gives investors access to international arbitral fora rather than domestic courts, it carries important legal and political consequences for states’ regulatory autonomy — consequences that are directly relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security calculations.

Brief overview of the mechanism
- ISDS provisions typically convert the investor’s treaty rights into a right to international arbitration against the host state. The tribunal’s jurisdiction rests on consent in the treaty or contract; the arbitration award is intended to be final and binding between the parties.
- Arbitration is the typical forum for ISDS claims. Procedural rules and the institutional framework determine how arbitrations are constituted, how evidence and hearings proceed, and how awards are administered.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and the functions it performs
The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), based in The Hague, is an intergovernmental institution that administers a range of international dispute‑settlement processes. In ISDS contexts the PCA can play several distinct roles:

1. Appointing authority
- Where treaties or parties provide for an appointing authority to fill gaps (for example, if parties cannot agree on an arbitrator), the PCA may be designated to nominate or appoint arbitrators. This role seeks to ensure impartiality and to break deadlocks in the constitution of tribunals.

2. Provider of arbitration rules
- Parties may elect to adopt the PCA’s arbitration rules as the procedural framework governing their disputes. Those rules set out timeframes, composition of tribunals, evidentiary procedures, emergency measures, and other process matters.

3. Administrative and logistical support
- The PCA provides a registry and case‑management services: filing and service of documents, organisation of hearings, management of administrative costs, and other secretarial functions necessary to run an arbitration efficiently.

Legal and enforcement context
- Arbitral awards administered via the PCA are enforced through the same cross‑border mechanisms available for commercial arbitration, most importantly the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. PCA‑administered awards are not the same as awards rendered under the World Bank’s ICSID Convention; ICSID awards benefit from a separate enforcement regime.
- The tribunal’s jurisdiction and the validity of an award depend on the underlying consent in the treaty or contract. Institutional involvement (e.g., PCA administration) does not itself confer jurisdiction.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Sovereignty and regulatory autonomy: ISDS enables investors to bypass domestic courts and obtain remedies directly against the state. For a state that views regulatory space as central to social policy and national security, ISDS raises concerns about “regulatory chill” — the risk that government actors will refrain from legitimate regulatory measures to avoid investor claims.
- Choice of forum and perceived neutrality: Selecting an institutional administrator like the PCA can affect perceptions of neutrality and procedural quality. For India, such choices interact with broader strategic considerations about engagement with international legal institutions and protection of domestic policy space.
- Enforcement and risk management: The prospect of arbitral awards enforceable abroad can have budgetary and reputational effects, influencing how ministries evaluate investment projects, defence or critical‑sector regulations, and procurement decisions that have national security implications.
- Jurisdictional limits: Political and legal debates in India — as in many jurisdictions — have focused on how to preserve policy space while respecting legitimate investor protections. Revisions to treaty practice or model investment instruments typically aim to clarify consent to arbitration, narrow substantive protections, or require exhaustion of local remedies (approaches vary by jurisdiction and negotiation).

Political controversy and reform dynamics
- ISDS is politically contested. Criticisms include a lack of transparency, inconsistent arbitral jurisprudence, potential conflicts of interest among arbitrators, and the perceived intrusion on states’ ability to regulate for public welfare and security.
- Internationally, conversations about reform have ranged from improving transparency and arbitrator appointment processes, to creating appellate mechanisms, to proposals for a multilateral investment court or other binding institutional reform. States have adopted different responses — modifying treaty language, pursuing carve‑outs for sensitive sectors, or tightening consent clauses in model bilateral investment treaties.
- India has, over recent years, re‑examined its investment treaty practice to better protect regulatory space and national interests. This recalibration reflects a broader strategic posture that balances welcoming foreign investment with preserving sovereign policy choices in areas linked to public order, security and development.

Concluding observation
For Indian policymakers, the presence of ISDS clauses and the choice to use institutions such as the PCA are not merely technical treaty matters: they are instruments that intersect with sovereignty, economic strategy, and national security. How India frames consent to arbitration, the procedural regimes it accepts, and the administrative fora it employs will continue to shape the country’s ability to reconcile investor protection with sovereign regulatory priorities.

Key terms
- ISDS (Investor–State Dispute Settlement): Mechanism in investment/trade treaties allowing investors to bring arbitration claims against states.
- Appointing authority: A neutral entity designated to nominate or appoint arbitrators if parties cannot agree.
- PCA (Permanent Court of Arbitration): Hague‑based intergovernmental institution that administers arbitration and can provide appointing, rules and administrative services.
- Arbitration rules: Procedural rules (e.g., PCA, UNCITRAL) that govern the conduct of arbitrations.
- New York Convention: International treaty enabling recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.

## Permanent Court of Arbitration — Examples of cases (Section: Cases)

Overview  
The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is not a single standing judiciary but an institutional registry and administrative hub that facilitates arbitration, conciliation and other dispute‑settlement procedures between states, and between private investors and states. The representative cases below—grouped by dispute type—illustrate the PCA’s long history (from early 20th‑century landmark arbitrations to contemporary UNCLOS and investment disputes), the consensual nature of its jurisdiction, and its doctrinal influence on issues of sovereignty, maritime delimitation, fisheries, and investor protection.

1. PCA: nature and institutional role (brief)
- PCA provides administrative services, a registry, and procedural support for ad hoc tribunals and treaty‑based proceedings. It does not itself adjudicate in a permanent bench format; parties routinely select arbitrators and rules, and the PCA supplies institutional continuity and logistical infrastructure.
- Jurisdiction before the PCA depends on consent—via treaties, special agreements, UNCLOS Annex VII submissions, or investment contracts/BITs. This consensual basis shapes both the scope and limits of PCA outcomes.
- PCA’s work ranges from one‑off interstate arbitrations to organizing large, multi‑party claims commissions (e.g., Iran–United States, Eritrea–Ethiopia).

2. Interstate arbitrations (selected landmark examples)
- United States v. Mexico (Pious Fund of the Californias) (1902)  
  Early arbitration on persistent claims and reparation; significant for procedures of inter‑state claims and state responsibility.
- United States v. United Kingdom (North Atlantic Coast Fisheries) (1910)  
  A dispute over fisheries rights and treaty interpretation; useful precedent on treaty text and practice in resource use.
- France v. Great Britain (Savarkar Case) (1911)  
  Addressed extradition/asylum and the political offense exception—illustrating how political considerations interact with legal obligations between states.
- United States v. The Netherlands (Island of Palmas/ Miangas) (1928)  
  Foundational territorial sovereignty arbitration; the award emphasized “effective and continuous display of state authority” (effectivités) over mere discovery. Palmas remains a doctrinal touchstone for sovereignty, territorial title, and the limits of historic claims.
- Eritrea v. Yemen (Hanish Islands) (1999)  
  Territorial delimitation for contested islands; demonstrates the PCA’s role in resolving sensitive post‑colonial boundary disputes.
- Belgium v. The Netherlands (Iron Rhine) (2005)  
  Involved cross‑border transit rights under a historic treaty; illustrates PCA’s handling of long‑standing inter‑state obligations and balancing of sovereign rights with treaty continuity.
- Croatia v. Slovenia (2017)  
  Complex land and maritime boundary delimitation between neighbours; exemplifies modern boundary arbitration where geographic, legal and historical factors converge.

3. UNCLOS Annex VII maritime arbitrations (selected)
- Barbados v. Trinidad and Tobago (2006)  
  Maritime boundary delimitation and the role of equidistance/equitable principles under UNCLOS.
- Bangladesh v. India (Bay of Bengal Maritime Boundary) (2014)  
  Final delimitation in a contested bay; significant for technical delimitation methodology and coastal‑state rights.
- Mauritius v. United Kingdom (Chagos Marine Protected Area) (2015)  
  Challenged the legality of a UK‑declared marine protected area around the Chagos Archipelago; demonstrates environmental measures’ intersection with contested sovereignty.
- Philippines v. China (2016)  
  High‑profile UNCLOS decision addressing maritime entitlements, status of maritime features, and lawfulness of certain conduct in the South China Sea. The tribunal rejected the historic‑rights claim as incompatible with UNCLOS; China declined to participate and rejected the award, highlighting enforcement and political limits.
- Netherlands v. Russia (MV Arctic Sunrise) (2017)  
  Dispute over detention of a vessel and jurisdictional claims linked to protests at sea; shows UNCLOS processes used to contest coastal‑state enforcement measures.
- Italy v. India (Enrica Lexie) (2020)  
  Raised complex questions on jurisdictional claims over alleged criminal acts at sea involving military personnel; exemplified the interface of criminal jurisdiction, immunity claims, and maritime law.

4. Investor–state arbitrations (selected)
- Hulley Enterprises, Yukos Universal and Veteran Petroleum v. Russian Federation (2015)  
  Large claims relating to alleged expropriation and denial of justice in the Yukos dismantling; emphasizes scale of investor‑state exposure and political‑economic dimensions.
- Cairn Energy PLC & Cairn UK Holdings Limited v. The Republic of India  
  Investor claim concerning retrospective tax assessments and alleged breaches of fair and equitable treatment; directly relevant to India’s experience with investor arbitration and domestic tax policy controversies. Such cases raise issues of annulment, enforcement under the New York Convention, and state responses (legislative or diplomatic).

5. PCA‑administered claims commissions and post‑conflict bodies
- Iran–United States Claims Tribunal (after 1979)  
  PCA helped establish the Tribunal in The Hague; it handled thousands of inter‑state and investor claims and remains a major example of large‑scale, treaty‑based arbitration machinery.
- Eritrea–Ethiopia Claims Commission (2009)  
  Organized by the PCA to adjudicate war‑related claims after the border conflict; shows PCA’s suitability for multi‑issue, post‑conflict legal accounting.
- Sudan v. Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (Abyei Arbitration) (2009)  
  PCA‑administered arbitration on the Abyei area’s status and administration between Sudan and the South; illustrates arbitration’s role in de‑escalating politically fraught territorial disputes.

6. Legal and strategic implications — why these cases matter for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Rule‑based dispute settlement as strategic instrument  
  PCA jurisprudence illustrates how legal adjudication can be a tool of statecraft: states use arbitration to depoliticize disputes, secure legal validation of claims, or signal commitment to international law. For India—whose strategic culture increasingly prizes multilateral legalism—PCA mechanisms offer an avenue to manage disputes (maritime delimitation, investor claims) without escalation.
- Maritime doctrine and UNCLOS practice  
  Decisions like Pilipinas v. China and Bangladesh v. India illuminate technical delimitation principles, status of maritime features, and limits of historic rights—areas directly relevant to India’s own maritime strategy (exclusive economic zone rights, continental shelf claims, fisheries management).
- Investment protection and domestic policy balance  
  Investor–state cases such as Cairn show how domestic fiscal and regulatory measures can spawn costly arbitration. For Indian policymakers, these precedents underscore the need to reconcile sovereign regulatory autonomy with treaty obligations and the potential financial and reputational costs of investor claims.
- Precedent on sovereignty and effectivités  
  Island of Palmas and Pious Fund reinforce doctrines (effective control, continuity of title, reparations) that shape how India might frame territorial claims and respond to competing historic assertions.
- Limits of legal remedies: consent and enforcement realities  
  PCA awards depend on parties’ consent to adjudication and often lack coercive enforcement mechanisms. The Philippines v. China case starkly demonstrates that favorable legal outcomes can be politically undermined if a state refuses to accept or implement an award. India’s strategic calculus thus must weigh legal wins against diplomatic and coercive capacities—using law as one instrument among many.
- Utility in post‑conflict accounting and stabilization  
  PCA‑organized claims commissions (e.g., Iran–US, Eritrea–Ethiopia) show how legal processes can contribute to post‑conflict compensation, normalization and rule‑making—relevant to India’s involvement in regional stabilization and peacebuilding initiatives.

Conclusion — key takeaways for the reader
- The PCA’s case history spans a wide substantive field: territorial sovereignty, maritime delimitation and jurisdiction, fisheries, investor–state arbitration, and large post‑conflict claims commissions.  
- Its institutional form—administrative support for ad hoc tribunals—gives it flexibility but also ties outcomes to state consent and political realities.  
- For Indian strategic culture and national security policy, PCA jurisprudence offers doctrinal guidance (on sovereignty, maritime rights, investor protection) and a cautionary lesson about the limits of legal remedies where enforcement and political will are lacking. Understanding these cases equips policy makers and strategists to use international adjudication prudently as part of a broader, legally informed statecraft.
