## G11 Members

### Definition and scope
“G11” (Group of Eleven) in the context used here denotes a forum — an organized platform through which primarily developing states coordinate policies and collective action. The label itself has been applied to different coalitions at different times; for the purposes of this chapter it should be read as a typological designation rather than a single, unchanging roster of countries. Conceptually, the G11 described here is a coalition of mostly low‑ and middle‑income states that have come together to address shared fiscal vulnerabilities, developmental shortfalls, and the political economy of external indebtedness.

### Naming ambiguity and methodological note
Scholars and practitioners should note the important ambiguity of the name “G11.” Historically the term has been used in different contexts and with differing memberships. Where a concrete set of member states is intended, that roster must be identified and sourced explicitly. Absent such specification, the remainder of this section treats the G11 as an archetypal grouping of developing countries united by common objectives: debt relief and sustainability, narrowing income gaps with advanced economies, and poverty reduction through coordinated policy instruments and collective negotiation.

### Composition
- Predominantly developing states: membership is mainly drawn from low‑ and middle‑income countries rather than high‑income industrial economies.
- Heterogeneous political economies: members typically differ in size, governance capacity, resource endowments and external vulnerability, which shapes both common interests and internal coordination challenges.
- Flexible institutional form: the forum often functions as an intergovernmental platform (periodic meetings, working groups, joint communiqués) rather than a treaty‑based organization.

### Primary objectives
The G11’s programmatic focus can be summarized in three interlocking aims:

1. Easing sovereign debt burdens
   - Pursuit of debt relief, restructuring, and mechanisms to improve debt sustainability for member states.
   - Collective negotiation with official and private creditors to obtain favorable terms, reduce rollover risk, and manage contingent liabilities.

2. Narrowing the income gap with rich countries
   - Policies and advocacy aimed at fostering faster convergence with advanced economies through improved access to finance, technology transfer, trade facilitation and preferential financing.

3. Lifting populations out of poverty
   - Emphasis on channeling macro‑fiscal adjustments and external financing toward inclusive development outcomes: social protection, public goods, infrastructure and human capital.

Taken together, these objectives reflect a strategic orientation toward fiscal sustainability as a precondition for both economic convergence and social uplift.

### Typical forum activities and mechanisms
The G11 operates through a suite of activities and instruments common to south‑south cooperative groupings:

- Policy coordination and peer learning
  - Comparative analysis of debt management practices, macro‑fiscal strategies and social safety net design; exchange of technical best practices.

- Collective negotiation and advocacy
  - Joint approaches to negotiations with multilateral creditors (IMF, World Bank) and creditor coalitions; coordinated lobbying for more favorable conditionalities or eligibility for concessional windows.

- Financial mechanisms
  - Coordination on debt restructuring, collective requests for debt swaps, access to concessional finance, and exploring pooled borrowing or credit enhancement mechanisms.

- Technical assistance and capacity building
  - Shared programs to strengthen national debt management offices, statistical capabilities, and public expenditure tracking.

- South‑South cooperation
  - Bilateral and multilateral development projects among members (infrastructure, health, education) to reduce dependency on Northern creditors.

### Expected benefits for members
- Improved debt sustainability: collective bargaining can yield longer maturities, lower interest costs, or partial relief.
- Enhanced negotiating leverage: acting together increases political and economic weight vis‑à‑vis large multilateral lenders and creditor blocs.
- Access to concessional finance and technical support: pooled expertise and advocacy can facilitate entry to concessional programs or special facilities.
- Policy diffusion: adoption of effective debt‑management and social policy instruments through peer learning.

### Risks and challenges
- Coordination difficulties: divergent national interests, fiscal capacities and political timelines complicate unified strategy.
- Creditor resistance: official and private lenders may resist collective demands, or impose stricter conditionalities in response.
- Conditionality and sovereignty trade‑offs: engagement with multilateral relief often carries policy conditionalities that can be politically costly domestically.
- Political instability and domestic change: regime shifts can undercut continuity of commitments, weakening the forum’s credibility.
- Moral hazard and signaling: poorly designed relief measures may distort incentives for sound fiscal management if not coupled with credible reforms.

### Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Though India is not conventionally catalogued as a G11 member in the many historical uses of the term, the G11 archetype is directly relevant to several elements of India’s strategic culture and security policy:

- Economic security as national security: India’s strategic calculus increasingly treats external indebtedness, access to concessional finance, and macroeconomic resilience as pillars of national security. Forums like a G11 provide templates for collective approaches to these challenges.
- South‑South diplomacy and strategic autonomy: India’s preference for multilateralism shaped by strategic autonomy — visible in its engagement with BRICS, G20 and G77 — aligns with the G11’s emphasis on south‑south cooperation and collective bargaining at Bretton Woods institutions.
- Development diplomacy: India’s external assistance and capacity‑building initiatives can both complement G11 objectives and be instruments of influence, advancing the twin aims of poverty reduction and geopolitical partnerships.
- Risk mitigation: India must weigh participation in such groupings against potential exposure to creditor politics, conditionality pressures, and the diplomatic cost of confrontations with major lenders.

### Conclusion
The G11, understood as a forum of mostly developing countries focused on debt relief, income convergence and poverty reduction, exemplifies how economic diplomacy is harnessed as a tool of development and security. For India and similar states, such groupings offer opportunities to bolster bargaining power, share technical capacity and align development finance with social objectives — but they also present coordination, political and creditor‑response risks that must be managed through careful strategy, institutional design and sustained domestic commitment to fiscal credibility.

### King Abdullah’s 2005 Proposal: Origin and Analytical Significance

The statement "King Abdullah of Jordan first proposed the group in 2005" identifies a clear origin point for an inter‑state initiative. Analytically this short sentence can be unpacked along several dimensions: actor, action, object and timing — and carries implications for diplomatic process, institutional design and regional strategic context.

- Actor (Subject): King Abdullah of Jordan  
  The proposal originated with a sitting head of state, which locates the initiative at the highest diplomatic and political level. That provenance signals a state‑sponsored, executive‑driven endeavour rather than a technocratic or civil‑society genesis. In the study of international organisations, the identity and rank of the proposer matters for credibility, resources and the speed with which other states respond.

- Action: "first proposed"  
  The phrasing indicates the initiation of an idea rather than the completion of a formal institution. "First proposed" implies an opening move in a diplomatic process that normally includes outreach, consultation, negotiation over terms, and possible refinement of aims before any founding declaration or charter is adopted.

- Object: "the group" (the Group of Eleven)  
  The reference to a “group” denotes a multilateral configuration whose contours (membership, mandate, permanence) must still be defined. Analytically, such groupings can range from loose consultative forums to treaty‑based organisations; the initial proposal sets a vector but not a fixed institutional outcome.

- Time: 2005  
  The year situates the proposal in a distinct geopolitical moment. 2005 followed the 2003 Iraq war and amid intensified regional diplomacy in the Middle East. Temporal context affects motive (security, economic, diplomatic), partner choice and urgency.

Institutional and Diplomatic Implications
- A head‑of‑state proposal typically triggers a diplomatic sequence: bilateral outreach to potential members, convening of preparatory meetings, drafting of a founding document, and negotiations over institutional architecture (secretariat, chairing arrangements, decision rules).  
- Key design questions for any nascent group include: who qualifies for membership; what specific purposes (security, economic cooperation, normative coordination); whether the grouping will have a permanent secretariat or rotating chair; and what legal status its founding documents will have.  
- The wording “first proposed” also invites scrutiny of subsequent steps: Did the idea attract anchor states? Was a formal launch held? Were institutional mechanisms put in place, and if so, what form did they take?

2005 Regional/Global Context — why timing matters
- The mid‑2000s Middle East was shaped by the aftermath of the Iraq intervention, shifting alliances, and renewed international attention to regional architectures for stability and reconstruction. Proposals in this period often sought to manage spillovers, create cooperative platforms for reconstruction and counter‑terrorism, or reposition states diplomatically.  
- Understanding the purpose of the Group of Eleven therefore requires reading the proposal against this background: security concerns, economic reconstruction, or diplomatic signaling could all be plausible drivers.

Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy
- India’s strategic posture routinely assesses new regional groupings for opportunity and risk. A state‑led initiative from Jordan in 2005 would be evaluated in New Delhi along several lines: potential impact on regional security dynamics; implications for Indian interests in West Asia (energy, diaspora, trade); prospects for India’s engagement or observer status; and signal value about shifting alliances or norms.  
- From a strategic‑culture perspective, how India responds (engage, observe, remain aloof) reflects longer‑term doctrines: non‑alignment/strategic autonomy, balancing partnerships, and protecting overseas interests. Indian policymakers would therefore monitor membership, agenda, and institutional depth to decide posture.

Follow‑up Questions for Reconstruction and Analysis
- Which states joined the proposed Group of Eleven, and when was (if ever) it formally launched?  
- What founding declaration, charter or institutional arrangements were adopted?  
- What were the group’s declared purpose and principal activities; did it convene meetings or produce communiqués?  
- How did regional events after 2005 affect the group’s trajectory (acceleration, reformulation, or dormancy)?

Concise summary
- The sentence records that Jordan’s King Abdullah initiated the idea for the Group of Eleven in 2005. This locates the origin as a high‑level, state‑driven diplomatic initiative at a particular post‑Iraq regional moment, and points toward the necessary subsequent steps of negotiation, institutional design and assessment of strategic implications — all questions of direct interest to analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### The “Group of Eleven” as a Development-for-Resilience Forum: Purpose, Tools and Strategic Implications

The so‑called “Group of Eleven” (G11) presents itself not as a treaty organization but as a diplomatic forum: a coalition primarily composed of developing states seeking to address chronic external constraints to development. Its stated objectives—easing debt burdens, expanding market access, and ultimately narrowing the income and welfare gap with richer economies—are unambiguous and linked to an explicit social goal: using the fiscal space freed by debt relief to lift “millions out of poverty.” To assess the G11 from the vantage of strategic culture and national security policy, one must situate these immediate aims within the technical instruments available, historical precedents, institutional constraints, and the political economy of creditor–debtor bargaining.

Composition and objectives
- Composition: Mostly developing countries that share high external debt service burdens and limited market access in advanced economy markets. The coalition’s strength lies less in formalized power than in concentrated advocacy: presenting a unified negotiating position toward creditors and multilateral lenders.
- Primary objective: Reduce the portion of national budgets captured by external debt servicing through debt relief, restructuring, swaps or rescheduling.
- Secondary objective: Secure preferential or improved market access (reduced tariffs, quota changes, removal of non‑tariff barriers) for key export sectors.
- Ultimate social goal: Redirect recurrent savings from debt service to growth‑enhancing and social spending—education, health, infrastructure—thereby reducing poverty and enhancing societal stability.

Operational tools and modalities
- Debt relief instruments: Forgiveness, partial write‑offs, restructuring (longer maturities, lower interest), rescheduling, and debt‑for‑development swaps. Each instrument carries different implications for creditors’ balance sheets and for debt sustainability.
- Market access mechanisms: Bilateral preferential trade agreements, targeted tariff reductions on labour‑intensive or high‑value agricultural goods, waiver of quotas, and the lowering of non‑tariff barriers (sanitary, phytosanitary, technical standards). The forum typically prioritizes sectoral requests where members possess comparative advantage.
- Complementary instruments: Concessional finance and lines of credit (from bilateral lenders or development banks), technical assistance for export standards and competitiveness, and conditional coordination with IMF/World Bank programs (e.g., incorporation into poverty reduction strategies and debt sustainability frameworks).

Why these measures? The economic logic
Debt relief and enhanced market access are complementary. Debt reduction frees fiscal resources that, if credibly channeled into productive and social investment, should raise growth potential and reduce vulnerability to shocks. Market access increases the ability of economies to absorb and productively employ these resources by expanding export receipts, diversifying industrial bases, and creating employment. The underlying idea is straightforward: reduce external drains and increase external earnings so that domestic policy space can be used for stabilizing and developmental priorities rather than for servicing creditors.

Historical precedents and institutional coordination
Past initiatives offer both templates and caveats:
- HIPC Initiative and MDRI: These multilateral efforts achieved substantial relief for many poor countries but were conditional on prolonged coordination with IMF/World Bank programs and often required macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms.
- Paris Club: A key bilateral creditor forum that conducts coordinated debt treatments among official creditors; negotiating with it remains essential for sovereign relief.
- Bilateral debt swaps and market access wins through preferential trade agreements have been episodic but instructive about the political bargaining required in creditor countries.

Successful outcomes typically required the G11 (or its members) to engage concurrently with multilateral institutions (IMF/World Bank) for debt sustainability assessments (DSAs) and with bilateral creditors (Paris Club members) for coordinated relief. NGOs and civil society actors also played a role in shaping public narratives around justice and poverty reduction, which eased creditor political resistance.

Challenges, trade‑offs and risks
- Creditor resistance: Full write‑offs or deep forgiveness are politically sensitive in creditor countries; creditors worry about fiscal backsliding and precedent setting.
- Moral hazard: Repeated or unconditional relief can create expectations that disincentivize prudent borrowing and policy discipline.
- Transparency and credibility: Accurate debt reporting, independent audits, and credible public spending plans are prerequisites for serious creditor engagement.
- Political economy: Market access concessions often meet protectionist pressures in creditor states, especially for politically salient sectors (agriculture, textiles).
- Measurement and monitoring: Demonstrating poverty impact requires rigorous targeting, baseline data, and monitoring frameworks linking debt relief to specific social outcomes.

Recommended strategy for the forum (operational roadmap)
1. Assemble robust debt sustainability analyses
   - Commission or coordinate DSAs in line with IMF/World Bank methodologies to quantify realistic relief needs and to set thresholds for sustainability.
   - Produce transparent national priority spending plans showing how savings will be allocated to growth and poverty reduction (health, education, infrastructure).

2. Present concrete, granular proposals to creditors
   - Move beyond general appeals to precise asks: amounts, proposed instruments (rescheduling vs. forgiveness), timelines, and contingent triggers (e.g., reform milestones).
   - Offer debt‑for‑development swap options that convert owed amounts into investments in agreed social goods.

3. Prioritize focused market‑access demands
   - Define sectoral targets where members have immediate comparative advantage (e.g., labour‑intensive manufactures, particular agricultural exports) and request tariff line or quota changes.
   - Combine market access requests with technical support packages to meet standards demanded by advanced markets.

4. Strengthen internal governance and accountability
   - Adopt transparent reporting on debt stock/use of relief, independent audits, and public financial management reforms to build creditor confidence.
   - Embed anti‑corruption safeguards and measurable program indicators for social spending.

5. Coordinate messaging and institutional alliances
   - Engage multilateral lenders early to align DSAs with IMF/World Bank frameworks and to avoid fragmented creditor responses.
   - Seek partnerships with NGOs and global civil society to shape public opinion and reduce political resistance in creditor countries.

Implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
For India, the G11’s agenda touches core elements of strategic culture: development diplomacy, strategic autonomy, and the linkage between economic resilience and national security. India’s national security calculus increasingly recognizes that chronic underdevelopment in neighbouring and partner states can generate migration pressures, instability, and strategic vacuums exploitable by rival powers. India can thus view support for G11 objectives as consonant with its long‑standing emphasis on South–South cooperation: by offering concessional lines of credit, capacity building for public financial management, and vocal support in multilateral fora (G20, BRICS), India advances both normative commitments to equitable development and hard‑headed security interests—stable neighbours, diversified supply chains, and expanded strategic influence.

Concluding note
The G11’s twin demands—debt relief and market access—are technically feasible but politically complex. Success hinges on credible domestic governance, precise and conditional proposals to creditors, and skilful multilateral coordination. For states like India, engagement with such a forum offers a pragmatic avenue to project developmental leadership while addressing longer‑term security concerns rooted in regional economic disparities.

### The Group of Eleven: Origins, Composition, and Strategic Implications

Founding and basic facts
- The Group of Eleven was established on 20 September 2006.  
- Its membership is characterized principally by countries classified as lower‑middle‑income economies (World Bank taxonomy).  
These two facts — foundation date and member economic profile — provide the starting point for understanding why and how the grouping was constituted.

Membership and economic profile
- The name “Group of Eleven” implies roughly eleven members; the precise roster is not given here and should be verified from primary documents.  
- “Lower‑middle‑income” is a technical category used by the World Bank. Thresholds for this classification shift over time with inflation and methodological updates, so any analysis must anchor the income‑status claim to the specific World Bank year being cited.  
- Coalitions of similarly classified economies frequently form to consolidate bargaining positions, coordinate development priorities, or share policy solutions tailored to comparable structural constraints (e.g., limited fiscal space, demographic profiles, industrial structure).

Why such a group is likely to have formed: interpretive propositions
- Shared economic circumstances generate common policy interests. Lower‑middle‑income states often confront parallel challenges — access to concessional finance, technology transfer, vulnerability to commodity and capital‑flow volatility, and the need for infrastructure investment. A small multilateral grouping allows them to (a) exchange policy experience, (b) present unified positions in global negotiations, and (c) pursue joint initiatives to attract investment or assistance.  
- In multilateral fora (WTO, IMF, World Bank, UN), a coherent caucus enhances negotiating leverage relative to isolated national actors. For states that lack the clout of high‑income powers, aggregation of voice is a principal strategy for influence.  
- The Group of Eleven’s existence therefore plausibly reflects an intent to institutionalize collective bargaining power and technical cooperation among similarly situated economies.

Mid‑2000s context (relevance of the 2006 founding date)
- The mid‑2000s were a dynamic period for development diplomacy: commodity prices were generally rising, the Doha Round of trade negotiations had stalled in many respects, and debates over development financing and conditionality were prominent. These conditions incentivized new or renewed coalitions among developing countries seeking more favorable trade and finance outcomes.  
- Establishment in September 2006 should be read against this milieu: the timing suggests the group may have been a response to contemporaneous multilateral negotiation cycles or to emerging economic opportunities and risks that lower‑middle‑income states wished to confront collectively.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For Indian strategic planners, the Group of Eleven model is instructive on two counts: coalition formation and economic diplomacy. India’s strategic culture prizes strategic autonomy but also recognizes the utility of ad hoc and formal coalitions to advance normative and material interests. Observing how a group of similarly situated economies organizes itself sheds light on how India might build or respond to south‑south coalitions.  
- If India shares issue‑areas with such a group (development finance, trade preferences, climate adaptation financing), the existence of the Group of Eleven indicates potential partners for issue‑based cooperation — or, conversely, competition for leadership among developing states.  
- From a security perspective, economic cohesion among a set of states reduces vulnerabilities that can have secondary security effects (e.g., fiscal crises, mass migration, political instability). Thus, Indian policymakers should factor multilateral economic coalitions into assessments of regional stability and partnership opportunities.

Methodological notes and recommended next research steps
- Locate the founding communiqué, press release, or founding statement dated 20 September 2006 to establish the group’s stated purpose, founding members, and initial agenda. Primary documents will also reveal whether the group intended to be institutionalized or remain an ad hoc forum.  
- Verify the exact membership list and trace changes since 2006. Membership flux can indicate the group’s success, political coherence, or relevance.  
- Consult records of multilateral negotiations (WTO, IMF, World Bank, UN) and public diplomacy outputs to map the Group of Eleven’s interventions, if any, and evaluate its influence on specific issue areas (trade, finance, development cooperation).  
- When invoking “lower‑middle‑income,” specify the World Bank year and income thresholds used in analysis to avoid anachronism.

Concise summary
The Group of Eleven was created on 20 September 2006 and is mainly composed of lower‑middle‑income countries. Its formation likely reflects an effort by similarly situated economies to coordinate positions on development, trade, and finance in a mid‑2000s international environment marked by contested multilateral negotiations and shifting economic conditions. For students of India’s strategic culture, the grouping offers a useful case of how economic coalitions can be instruments of influence and stability — a modality India may engage with or mirror in its own policy practice. Further research should prioritize primary founding documents, exact member verification, and tracing the group’s activity in major multilateral forums.

### Case study: the “Group of Eleven” request to the G8 — structure, intent and implications for India’s strategic culture

This short case study examines a reported coalition—self-styled here as the “Group of Eleven”—and its stated action of making a request to the G8. The purpose is twofold: first, to unpack the basic facts and likely motives behind such a move; and second, to draw out what this interaction reveals about evolving patterns of coalition diplomacy that matter to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

Composition and regional spread
- The Group of Eleven is reported to comprise: Jordan, Croatia, Ecuador, Georgia, El Salvador, Honduras, Indonesia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, and Sri Lanka.
- These eleven are sovereign states drawn from multiple regions: Middle East / North Africa (Jordan, Morocco), Europe / Eurasia (Croatia, Georgia), Latin America (Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Paraguay), and Asia (Indonesia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka).
- The membership mix spans lower-, middle- and upper-middle-income states, indicating a cross-regional coalition of developing and middle-income countries rather than a homogeneous regional bloc.

The recipient: the G8 in context
- The Group has addressed its request to the G8—traditionally the forum of major industrial democracies (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and, historically, Russia). The G8’s members are wealthy states with disproportionate influence over finance, security and global governance norms.
- Sending a joint request to the G8 signals an effort by smaller and mid-sized states to engage directly with those who control large financial and political levers.

What the public facts tell us (and what they do not)
- Known: the membership list; that a request has been made to the G8.
- Unknown / unspecified in the public outline: the substantive content of the request (e.g., aid, debt relief, trade concessions, climate finance, security cooperation, political recognition), the timing and forum (which summit or ministerial), and the authorised representative(s) for the Group.
- Analytically important: whether the “Group of Eleven” is an ad hoc arrangement created around a specific ask or a more enduring, formalised coalition with an institutional secretariat and follow-up mechanisms.

Plausible motives for a collective request
- Development finance or debt relief appeals to secure concessional lending or restructuring.
- Trade or market-access requests seeking preferential terms or tariff relief.
- Climate finance and technology transfer appeals, especially for vulnerable middle-income countries.
- Requests for security cooperation, counter-terrorism assistance, or maritime/security guarantees.
- Political or diplomatic objectives (recognition, observer status in relevant forums, invitations).
- The diversity of members suggests the coalition may be bundling disparate but complementary needs to increase bargaining leverage.

Diplomatic implications and strategic logic
- Collective engagement amplifies the voices of smaller states when addressing powerful states—an example of coalition diplomacy as bargaining strategy.
- For the G8, such requests create opportunities to shape agendas and attach conditions (policy reform, governance assurances). For requestors, the risk is that requests become conditionalised.
- The cross-regional nature of the Group of Eleven suggests an attempt to create a wider normative claim (not simply a regional grievance) and to appeal to broad principles (development equity, climate vulnerability, fairness in global governance).

Recommended practical steps for the Group of Eleven (operational checklist)
- Clarify and publicly articulate the precise content and objectives of the request.
- Identify timing and forum: which G8 summit or ministerial will receive the request and who will present it.
- Designate authorised representatives and a lead coordinator to manage follow-up and negotiations.
- Prepare evidence-backed policy asks: costed proposals, implementation plans, and benchmarks to answer likely G8 conditions.
- Consider allied partners among G8 members or other states/institutions (World Bank, IMF, EU) to broaden support.
- Decide whether to institutionalise the coalition (secretariat, periodic meetings) or treat it as an ad hoc negotiation vehicle.

Risks and considerations
- Heterogeneous interests within the Group of Eleven can complicate collective bargaining: divergent domestic priorities may weaken unified positions.
- G8 responses will vary by member and by issue area; gaining unanimous support from the G8 is unlikely, so targeted bilateral lobbying will be necessary.
- Conditionality risk: aid or concessions from the G8 may come with policy or governance preconditions that have domestic political costs for Group members.
- Reputational risk if the coalition is perceived as instrumentalised by external powers or as lacking legitimacy at home.

Historical and normative context
- Historically, multilateral appeals to wealthy states (G8/G7) have focussed on financing (debt relief, development aid), trade access, and climate commitments. The use of cross-regional coalitions to press demands is an established tactic in global diplomacy.
- Such interactions are also part of a broader contest over global governance: who sets agendas, who gets access, and how equity claims from the Global South are adjudicated.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s strategic culture values multipolar engagement, non-alignment in form and coalition-building in function. A cross-regional Group of Eleven approaching the G8 highlights several policy lessons and opportunities for India:
  - Diplomatic posture: India can view coalition diplomacy as a normative and practical instrument—reinforcing its own history of South-South cooperation while also calibrating selective alignment with major powers to secure outcomes.
  - Convening and mediation role: India, as a major Global South power, could offer to mediate between the Group and G8 actors, or provide technical support (policy design, finance mobilisation), thereby enhancing its diplomatic influence.
  - Agenda-setting: India can seize the substantive agenda—if the request touches on climate, development finance, or trade—by promoting language and solutions that reflect Global South priorities (e.g., concessional finance mechanisms, technology transfer clauses with protections).
  - Strategic signalling: India’s response—supportive, neutral, or aloof—would signal where it places itself between established Western-led forums and emerging south–south coalitions. Support could reinforce India’s leadership claim among developing states; neutrality could preserve bilateral ties with G8 members.
  - Security calculus: if the Coalition’s ask touches on security matters (counterterrorism, maritime security), India must evaluate implications for regional security balances and its own partnerships with G8 members.
  - Institutional learning: India should study the Group’s operational checklist and conditionality risks to refine its own negotiating posture in future multilateral engagements.

Concluding note
A seemingly modest diplomatic act—a cross-regional coalition making a joint request to the G8—encapsulates broader themes central to modern strategic culture: the use of coalitions to amplify bargaining power, the tension between sovereignty and conditional cooperation, and the growing salience of middle powers in shaping global policy. For India, such episodes are both a mirror and an opportunity: they reveal preferred practices in international bargaining and provide concrete openings for India to exercise influence consistent with its strategic culture and national security objectives.

### The 2007 G11 Dead Sea Summit and its Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture

Background and summary
- In May 2007 a summit of a coalition of developing states often referred to as the “G11” convened at the Dead Sea resort in Jordan. The group—distinct from institutional groupings like the G8 or G20 and with membership that can vary—articulated a collective agenda to engage industrialized countries to relieve debt burdens and create conditions for sustained, diversified growth.
- The G11 statement framed four interlocking priorities: (1) expand fiscal and monetary policy space for development; (2) convert unsustainable debt burdens into financing for poverty‑reducing investments; (3) secure improved market access and removal of trade barriers; and (4) build scientific, technological and human‑capacity to underpin long‑term productive capabilities. The summit explicitly sought political dialogue with the G8 to advance these ends.

Core analytical points
- Fiscal and monetary space. The G11 argued that many developing economies lacked the “policy space” to undertake countercyclical spending or accommodative monetary policy without risking fiscal instability or inflation. In practice this means seeking measures—debt relief, concessional finance, grant funding—that relax budget constraints and allow public investment in infrastructure, education and industrial policy.
- Debt conversion and relief. The summit proposed converting portions of debt into direct financing for development projects (debt‑for‑development or debt‑swap instruments). Such mechanisms are not novel—precedents include HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative) and the MDRI (Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative)—but the G11 flagged gaps in coverage and called for more flexible, project‑linked approaches.
- Market access and trade barriers. G11 members identified tariffs, quotas and non‑tariff barriers imposed by developed countries as decisive impediments to export‑led improvements in living standards. Their remedies ranged from tariff reductions and preferential access to improved rules of origin and removal of technical and sanitary barriers that act as disguised protectionism.
- Capacity building in science and technology. The group emphasized long‑term investments in education, R&D and technology transfer. Developing technological skills and absorptive capacity was presented as necessary for moving up value chains and converting improved market access into sustainable economic outcomes.
- Internal and external cooperation. Internally, the G11 asked members to coordinate on development strategies, share policy lessons, and harmonize positions in international fora. Externally, they sought political dialogue with the G8 and other partners to secure both financial concessions and policy changes (trade liberalization, investment facilitation).
- Vulnerabilities of export‑led growth. The summit recognized that reliance on exports exposes developing economies to external shocks—commodity price volatility, demand contractions in rich countries, and restrictive trade practices. Reducing vulnerability requires both domestic diversification and international concessions.

Mechanisms, precedents and practicalities
- Debt‑for‑development swaps can convert debt stock into funded projects (education, health, environment) administered jointly by creditor and debtor or by multilateral agencies. Such swaps require transparent project design, credible monitoring, and safeguards to avoid moral hazard.
- Existing relief frameworks (HIPC, MDRI) provide templates but are narrow in coverage and conditionality; G11 proposals pushed for broader, more flexible arrangements that link relief directly to capacity building and growth‑enhancing investment.
- Market access can be advanced through tariff liberalization, special and differential treatment, preferential trade agreements, and the removal of non‑tariff barriers (technical regulations, SPS measures). Crucially, negotiated concessions must be accompanied by capacity support so exporters in developing countries can meet standards and rules of origin.
- Scientific and technological capacity requires long‑term financing: investments in tertiary education, vocational training, public R&D, and institutional arrangements for technology transfer (joint ventures, licensing, South‑South cooperation).

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Economic security as national security. India’s strategic culture has long recognized the link between economic autonomy and national security. The G11 agenda underlines that chronic debt burdens, restricted policy space, and limited access to advanced technologies are not merely economic problems but strategic vulnerabilities that can constrain India’s ability to pursue independent policy in crises.
- Multilateral engagement and coalition‑building. The Dead Sea initiative typifies the strategy of using coalitions of developing states to extract concessions from richer powers. For India this reinforces a preference for bargaining within plurilateral and multilateral formats (G20, BRICS, G77/China) to amplify its negotiating clout on trade, technology transfer and development finance.
- Balancing openness and strategic industrial policy. India must reconcile the benefits of market access with protecting strategic sectors and building domestic capabilities. The G11 emphasis on capacity building supports India’s dual approach: seek improved access abroad while nurturing indigenous R&D, skill formation and manufacturing capacity at home.
- Preserving policy space. The summit’s stress on fiscal and monetary room echoes Indian policy debates about macroeconomic buffers—reserves, prudent public debt levels, and access to concessional finance—that allow countercyclical action without jeopardizing sovereign creditworthiness.
- Diplomatic instruments and development finance. India can treat debt‑conversion mechanisms and negotiated relief as tools of statecraft: deploying them multilaterally to secure both development finance and diplomatic leverage, and domestically to finance priority investments in human capital and infrastructure.
- Managing external shock vulnerability. The G11 diagnosis underscores why India has built foreign‑exchange buffers, diversified export markets, and pursued regional trade ties—to reduce exposure to commodity swings and protectionism in traditional markets.

Policy implications and small set of recommendations
- Use multilateral coalitions to press for trade concessions while negotiating capacity‑building packages (funding, standards assistance) that enable India’s exporters to benefit from market access.
- Advocate flexible, project‑linked debt relief or swaps that finance education, health, and R&D, while ensuring transparency and safeguards against misuse.
- Prioritize investments in absorptive capacity—technical education, public R&D, industrial extension services—so that trade concessions can translate into climbing global value chains.
- Maintain macro buffers and prudent fiscal policy to preserve discretionary policy space for countercyclical spending when required.
- Integrate economic vulnerability assessments into national security planning: map how debt, trade barriers and technology dependence translate into strategic risk.

Key takeaways
- The Dead Sea G11 summit linked debt relief, market access, capacity building and political engagement with industrialized states as mutually reinforcing priorities for development.
- Implementation requires concrete mechanisms: negotiated debt relief or swaps, trade concessions plus technical assistance, concessional finance, and sustained investments in science and human capital.
- For India, the summit’s agenda confirms enduring features of its strategic culture: multilateralism, emphasis on development as security, the need for policy space, and the centrality of building indigenous productive and technological capabilities.

### G11 proposal on debt

Overview
- The Group of Eleven (G11) has advanced a targeted debt proposal addressed principally to the G8 and other influential creditor states: sovereign creditors should convert portions of existing debt owed by heavily indebted countries into forms of assistance earmarked for social development projects. Framed as a debt-for-development swap, the proposal aims to reorient debt servicing flows away from pure financial repayment and toward investments in human development, basic services and employment-generation in debtor countries.

Actors and audience
- Speaker/actor: the G11, a coalition of indebted or developing states acting collectively to reshape creditor–debtor relations.
- Audience/target: primary addressees are major official creditors (the G8 and other bilateral lenders), as well as multilateral institutions that influence debt architecture (Paris Club, IMF, World Bank) and domestic policymakers in creditor states whose political support is required.

Mechanism proposed
- Convert outstanding debt obligations into assistance instruments directed at predefined social development projects. Operationally, this can take multiple forms:
  - Debt-for-development swaps in which creditors agree to cancel or reduce sovereign debt in return for debtor governments’ commitment to spend an agreed local-currency equivalent on social programs;
  - Reprofiling of debt with conditionalities that channel freed fiscal space into agreed development expenditures;
  - Creditor-funded trust funds that absorb a portion of debt service and disburse grants for specified projects.

Direct beneficiaries and stated goals
- Direct beneficiaries: the poor and vulnerable populations of indebted countries through expanded public spending on health, education, basic infrastructure and employment programs.
- Stated socioeconomic goals: reduce income and welfare gaps between rich and poor, increase access to essential services, create employment opportunities and thereby alleviate poverty.

Claimed economic and diplomatic effects
- Economic effects claimed: by redirecting resources toward productive social investment, the proposal is argued to increase human capital, stimulate local demand and job creation, and improve long-term growth prospects in debtor countries.
- Diplomatic/social effects claimed: enhanced goodwill, fraternity and understanding between creditor and debtor societies, which could translate into improved political relations and soft-power gains for creditors who participate.

Strategic/global objectives and implicit creditor interests
- The G11 frames these national-level social outcomes as contributing to broader global objectives — prosperity, peace and stability — on the logic that poverty and exclusion are drivers of instability, conflict and irregular migration.
- Implicit claim: pursuing such debt conversion aligns with the self-interest of creditor states. The argument is that investments in stability abroad reduce security risks at home (e.g., transnational terrorism, refugee flows), and generate geopolitical goodwill that can be strategically valuable.

Historical precedents and comparative models
- The proposal sits within an established family of instruments and initiatives:
  - Debt-for-nature swaps of the 1980s–1990s, whereby debt relief was exchanged for conservation funding;
  - Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), which provided comprehensive multilateral relief tied to poverty-reduction strategies;
  - Bilateral debt relief arrangements and partial swap programs implemented by creditor governments and NGOs.
- These precedents provide both proof of concept and lessons on conditionality, monitoring and political economy constraints.

Institutional pathways for implementation
- Existing creditor coordination fora and institutions would be central to any operationalization:
  - Paris Club mechanisms for coordinated bilateral debt restructuring;
  - IMF and World Bank platforms to assess debt sustainability and to align relief with macroeconomic stability and poverty-reduction frameworks;
  - New bilateral trust funds or multilateral vehicles where necessary to manage funds and project selection independently of political capture.

Key implementation requirements
- Clear project selection criteria: projects should be evidence-based, aligned with national poverty-reduction strategies, and prioritized for high-impact sectors (health, education, basic infrastructure, employment schemes).
- Monitoring and accountability: independent monitoring, transparent reporting of fund flows and outcomes, and participatory mechanisms involving civil society and local communities.
- Legal and contractual clarity: precise terms on what portion of debt is converted, enforceable commitments on spending priorities, and dispute-settlement mechanisms.
- Coordination with macroeconomic policy: ensuring debt conversion does not undermine credible fiscal frameworks or crowd out productive private investment.

Risks, challenges and mitigation
- Corruption and weak governance: without robust safeguards, resources freed by debt conversion can be diverted; mitigation requires independent audits, civil-society oversight and conditional disbursement triggers.
- Moral hazard: concerns that creditors forgiving debt will encourage irresponsible borrowing or lax fiscal discipline; this is addressed by linking conversions to governance reforms and debt-sustainability assessments.
- Creditors’ financial loss concerns: bilateral lenders may resist face-value write-downs; creative structures (partial cancellations, longer maturities with concessional interest, or third-party financing of the “conversion premium”) can bridge political acceptability.
- Implementation capacity constraints in debtor states: technical assistance and capacity-building should accompany the conversions to ensure effective project execution.

Recommended project focus areas
- Health: primary care, vaccination, maternal and child health to yield high social returns and resilience.
- Education: basic and vocational education oriented to labor-market needs to expand human capital.
- Basic infrastructure: water and sanitation, rural roads and electrification that underpin economic activity.
- Employment programs: public works and labor-market interventions that provide immediate jobs while building assets.

Assumptions and limits
- The policy rests on the implicit assumption that redirected funds will be efficiently used and will translate into the claimed social outcomes. Historical experience cautions that outcomes depend on governance, absorptive capacity and the design of conditionalities and monitoring systems.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India — a rising regional power with substantial development cooperation engagement — the G11-style approach has several implications:
  - Soft-power and partnership opportunities: engaging constructively in debt-for-development models (as creditor, technical partner, or trilateral collaborator) aligns with India’s emphasis on development diplomacy and non-coercive influence.
  - Regional stability and security: promoting socioeconomic resilience in neighbouring and partner states reduces trans-border insecurity and migration pressures, consonant with India’s strategic preference for stable peripheries.
  - Institutional posture: India’s selective use of concessional finance and lines of credit could be calibrated to support debt conversion or complementary capacity-building, leveraging Indian expertise in health, education and infrastructure.
  - Cautionary stance: India’s own strategic culture — which prizes sovereignty and non-interference — suggests preference for borrower-led, non-imperial frameworks with robust local ownership and minimal conditionality perceived as political interference.
- Policy recommendation for Indian policymakers: support multilateral and regional mechanisms that emphasize transparent governance, capacity-building and respect for recipient ownership while exploring targeted participation in debt-for-development initiatives that advance both humanitarian and strategic objectives.

Conclusion
- The G11 proposal is a pragmatic reconfiguration of creditor–debtor relations: it reconceives debt not merely as a liability but as an instrument that can be repurposed for human development and stability. Its success depends on institutional design, safeguards against governance failures, credible monitoring, and alignment with macroeconomic stability. For states like India, the proposal offers opportunities to project influence through development cooperation, contribute to regional stability and align strategic interests with poverty-reduction objectives — provided implementation respects recipient ownership and political sensitivities.
