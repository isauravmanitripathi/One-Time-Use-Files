## Introduction

Name and definition
- The Three Seas Initiative (widely abbreviated 3SI or TSI) is also referred to in diplomatic and scholarly literature as the Baltic–Adriatic–Black Sea Initiative, the Trimarium (Latin) and, in Polish usage, Trójmorze. Colloquially it is often shortened to “Three Seas” or “the Three Seas Initiative.” These name variants emphasize the north–south axis that defines the grouping’s geographic and strategic logic.

Nature and institutional character
- 3SI is an intergovernmental political forum rather than a treaty-based organization. It was created to promote regional cooperation among states on issues of mutual interest without creating supranational governance structures. Decision-making and coordination occur through periodic leader-level summits, ministerial meetings and working groups; there is no single, binding constitution or treaty that vests sovereignty in a central body.

Geographic scope and original membership
- The Initiative groups countries located on a north–south axis across Central and Eastern Europe, running between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. The original founding summit (Dubrovnik, Croatia, 2016) brought together a core of EU member states from that corridor. The initial membership comprised twelve EU countries: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. (Greece joined later, bringing the number of EU member states in the Initiative to thirteen.)

Primary aims and practical focus
- 3SI’s stated purpose is to provide a regional dialogue and practical cooperation framework for questions affecting participating states, concentrating on tangible connectivity outcomes. The Initiative has consistently prioritized three practical pillars: transport connectivity (roads, rail, ports), energy connectivity and diversification (pipelines, interconnectors, LNG, and related security of supply measures), and digital infrastructure (broadband, data corridors, 5G-related resilience). These sectors both reflect and operationalize the Initiative’s twin economic and strategic objectives: to improve intra-regional connectivity and to reduce strategic vulnerabilities that arise from limited route options or overreliance on single external suppliers.

Institutional evolution and participation categories
- From its inception as an EU-member-state forum, 3SI has evolved a flexible participation model. It distinguishes formally between “members” (EU states participating fully in the Initiative) and “partner-participants” (non-EU countries invited into the process with a more limited but operational role). This flexibility has allowed the Initiative to expand beyond EU borders while maintaining a primarily intergovernmental character. Notable milestones in this evolution include the 7th summit in Riga on 20 June 2022, when Ukraine was granted “partner-participant” status and became, in practice, a de facto participant in Initiative activities. At the 2023 summit, Greece acceded as a member and Moldova was accepted as a partner-participant. The enlargement trend continued at the 2025 summit, when Albania and Montenegro were admitted as partner-participants. These developments illustrate 3SI’s gradual outward expansion and the deliberate distinction between full membership and partner roles.

Project delivery and financing mechanisms
- While 3SI does not operate as a centralized funding agency, it supports infrastructure projects through a range of investment instruments and coordination mechanisms. The Initiative is commonly associated with a dedicated investment vehicle—an investment fund and associated platforms created to leverage public and private capital for cross-border projects that meet the Initiative’s connectivity priorities. At the same time, much project implementation depends on national budgets, EU funding instruments, multilateral development banks and bilateral investment arrangements coordinated under the Initiative’s project pipeline.

Geopolitical dimensions and regional significance
- 3SI sits at the intersection of economic, infrastructural and strategic objectives. Analysts see it as a mechanism to deepen EU cohesion on the eastern flank of the Union, enhance resilience against energy and transport chokepoints, and provide a forum for coordinating diversification away from single-route dependencies. Its activities therefore have implications for regional security dynamics, the internal cohesion of the EU, and the architecture of European connectivity. Because it is not an EU institution per se, 3SI also provides a platform for partner states outside the EU to coordinate more closely with EU members on shared connectivity and security concerns.

Operational rhythm and governance practice
- The Initiative’s agenda is driven by periodic summits of heads of state and government, supplemented by ministerial meetings (transport, energy, digital), technical working groups, and ad hoc project review mechanisms. This summit-driven model shapes both the visibility of 3SI and the modalities by which status changes (membership or partner-participant admissions) and project announcements are made. Coordination remains intergovernmental: 3SI adds value through political momentum, project matchmaking and pooling of diplomatic and financial support rather than through centralised regulatory authority.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For readers concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the Three Seas Initiative offers several instructive parallels and possible points of engagement. First, 3SI exemplifies a regional connectivity strategy driven by a combination of economic objectives and strategic hedging—an approach familiar to Indian policymakers engaged in connectivity diplomacy (e.g., the Indo-Pacific, neighbourhood infrastructure partnerships). Second, 3SI’s use of flexible participation categories (members and partner-participants) and its reliance on investment instruments rather than supranational integration offer a model for India when designing or entering multilateral connectivity groupings that must accommodate states with differing institutional attachments. Third, the Initiative’s focus on diversifying energy routes and hardening transport and digital links speaks directly to the security-minded elements of strategic culture: infrastructure is both an economic asset and a locus of strategic vulnerability. Finally, 3SI’s engagement with non-EU partners suggests pathways by which India could seek cooperative niches in European-led connectivity efforts—whether through investment, technology partnerships, or participation in project financing—while advancing its own aim of shaping plural, regionally-grounded connectivity architectures.

Concluding note
- The Three Seas Initiative is best understood as a pragmatic, summit-led forum that fuses infrastructure priorities with geopolitical intent. Its evolution from an EU member-state dialogue to a more inclusive, partner-oriented architecture reflects both the practicalities of cross-border project delivery and the political desire to widen cooperation in Central and Eastern Europe. For scholars of strategic culture, 3SI is a compact case study in how regional actors translate connectivity imperatives into institutional forms that balance national sovereignty, collective goals and the demands of financing and implementation.

### The Three Seas countries in numbers — concise profile and strategic reading

The twelve countries that participate in the Three Seas Initiative together constitute a significant sub‑bloc within the European Union. Quantitative description is often the first step in assessing both the material weight of a regional grouping and the strategic opportunities it presents. The following section summaries the salient facts, unpacks their implications, and draws brief lessons for strategic thinkers — including those interested in how India frames regional cooperation, infrastructure, and security.

Data summary (as presented)
- Collective territory: 29% of EU territory — 1,210,000 km2 (470,000 sq mi).
- Population: 25% of EU inhabitants — roughly 110 million people.
- Economic output (nominal GDP): €2.3 trillion, described as “one seventh” of the EU’s nominal GDP (≈14.3%).

Direct numerical inferences and simple averages
- Per‑country simple averages (12 members): ~100,833 km2 area; ~9.17 million people; ~€191.7 billion nominal GDP.
- Group nominal GDP per capita: €2.3 trillion / 110 million ≈ €20,900 per person.
- The ordering territory (29%) > population (25%) > GDP share (~14.3%) signals a lower GDP per capita for the group relative to the EU average.

Methodological caveats
- Nominal vs PPP: The figures use nominal GDP, i.e., market‑exchange‑rate values. Nominal measures are appropriate for assessing market size, financial flows, and budgetary power; purchasing‑power parity (PPP) would better capture living‑standard comparators. Analysts should choose the measure that fits the question (market leverage vs welfare comparisons).
- Reference year and rounding: The original statement omits a reference year. Economic and population data change annually; precise analysis requires the year and source. The phrasing “one seventh” rounds a share that should be calculated exactly when precision matters.
- Verification: Cross‑check with Eurostat, IMF, World Bank, and official Three Seas publications before using these numbers in policy or academic work.

Strategic and policy implications
- Relative weight vs. per‑capita productivity: The group’s sizable territory and population confer strategic importance in the EU—especially for land‑based connectivity, energy transit, and logistical corridors. However, the lower GDP share suggests lower aggregate productivity and fiscal capacity than Western and Northern EU members. This matters for the financing of large infrastructure projects, defence spending, and resilience investments.
- Infrastructure and connectivity leverage: Given geographic position (north‑south corridors between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic Seas), the Three Seas states can exert outsized influence on multimodal transport, energy diversification, and digital connectivity within Europe. These domains are exactly where regional cooperation can convert territorial mass into strategic leverage.
- Political economy of burden sharing: Lower per‑capita GDP and fiscal constraints affect how the group can contribute to collective projects. External financing (EU cohesion funds, multilateral development banks) and public‑private partnerships will remain key tools.
- Signalling and external partnerships: The grouping’s size makes it an attractive partner for external powers seeking regional footholds. For European security planners and third‑party actors (including India), this amplifies the importance of calibrated engagement that respects local agency and capacity constraints.

Lessons for India's strategic culture and national security policy
- Read strategic weight beyond GDP: India’s own regional engagements (e.g., BIMSTEC, BBIN, Indo‑Pacific partnerships) can benefit from observing how a grouping with moderate economic output but significant territorial and demographic weight defines influence through connectivity and security cooperation.
- Infrastructure as multiplier: The Three Seas example underscores how targeted investment in transport, energy, and digital links can transform a region’s strategic relevance — a lesson applicable for India’s neighborhood policy and its efforts to shape regional supply chains.
- Data discipline and narrative framing: Precise, sourced statistics matter in constructing strategic narratives. Policymakers should avoid rounded claims without year and source; credibility in diplomacy and security arguments rests on methodological clarity.
- Partnership design respecting capacity differences: Just as the Three Seas states require external financing and phased burden‑sharing, India’s external initiatives should account for heterogeneity in partners’ fiscal capacities and institutional readiness.

Recommended practical step
- For rigorous comparative or policy work, verify the numbers against up‑to‑date databases (Eurostat, IMF, World Bank) and cite the reference year. When comparing regions, state explicitly whether figures are nominal or PPP and, if relevant, provide per‑capita and per‑km2 breakdowns.

This concise profile therefore serves two purposes: it anchors the Three Seas Initiative’s material significance inside the EU, and it extracts transferable lessons — about connectivity, capacity constraints, and analytic rigor — that are directly relevant to Indian strategic planners considering regional architectures and external partnerships.

### The Three Seas Initiative (3SI): Origins, Purpose and Strategic Significance — Lessons for India

• The subject under consideration is the Three Seas Initiative (3SI), a regional political and economic platform launched in 2015.  
• The initiative consciously draws intellectual lineage from the Polish interwar concept of the "Intermarium" (Międzymorze), an idea associated with Józef Piłsudski that envisaged cooperation among states lying between the Baltic, Black and Adriatic seas.  
• 3SI was formally launched in 2015 by Polish President Andrzej Duda and Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.  
• Its core membership consists of a cluster of European Union states situated between the three seas — commonly described as a 12‑state grouping.

Background and intellectual antecedent
- Intermarium. The Intermarium was a geopolitical proposal from the interwar Polish strategic imagination that sought a federative or cooperative arrangement among Central and Eastern European states to secure independence from both German and Russian domination. Though never realized as a formal federation, Intermarium left a durable conceptual imprint: the idea that regional cooperation across a defined strategic corridor — here, the space bounded by three seas — could serve both security and economic ends.
- 3SI revives this spatial notion in a post‑Cold War, European Union context. Rather than advocating political federation, it emphasizes sectoral cooperation (connectivity, infrastructure, energy, digital corridors) within the EU framework.

Objectives and membership
- Purpose. The Three Seas Initiative is principally a connectivity project aimed at strengthening north–south links across Central and Eastern Europe. Its priority areas are transport infrastructure, energy interconnections (including gas and electricity), and digital connectivity. The initiative seeks to close infrastructural gaps that have historically left the region oriented along east–west axes rather than integrated north–south.
- Membership note. The initiative is understood as a core group of EU states located between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas — commonly enumerated as twelve countries — that cooperate through annual summits, ministerial meetings and project pipelines. Its institutional architecture remains light: it is a forum for coordination, project prioritization and partnership building rather than a treaty‑based organisation.

Geostrategic relevance
- Regional bonding and resilience. 3SI is an instrument for strengthening intra‑regional ties, improving economic cohesion, and reducing strategic vulnerabilities that arise from overreliance on single routes or suppliers.
- Energy diversification. A principal motivation is energy security: developing pipeline and LNG infrastructure and electricity interconnectors reduces dependence on any single external supplier and creates bargaining space for member states.
- Investment and Western backing. By highlighting investible connectivity projects, 3SI is intended to attract Western capital and institutional partnerships. The initiative has received visible political and material support from the United States, which views it as complementary to transatlantic security and energy objectives.
- Strategic signalling. 3SI sits at the intersection of EU integration, regional balancing, and great‑power competition. It provides a vehicle for Central and Eastern European states to articulate collective priorities distinct from both Western and Russian networks of influence.

Implications and analytical lessons for India
- Small‑state led connectivity as strategic agency. 3SI illustrates how a coalition of middle and smaller states can use sectoral cooperation — especially infrastructure and energy networks — to enhance strategic autonomy. India’s neighbourhood policies (Act East, SAGAR, Connectivity initiatives) can be read against a similar logic: infrastructure and connectivity are instruments of influence and resilience, not merely economics.
- Diversification and supply‑chain thinking. Energy and transport diversification under 3SI mirror concerns central to India’s national security: dependence on single routes or suppliers (e.g., Middle Eastern oil, specific chokepoints) is a strategic risk. The European experience underscores the value of regional interconnectors and alternative logistics corridors.
- Platform model versus formal institutionalisation. 3SI’s light institutional form shows that effective strategic cooperation does not always require heavy supranational structures. For India, the model points to flexible, project‑oriented platforms that coordinate financing, standards and project pipelines among heterogeneous partners.
- Great‑power interlinkages. The US endorsement of 3SI demonstrates how regional initiatives can be amplified through alignment with external powers. India must similarly weigh the benefits and risks of external partnerships that can catalyse domestic regional projects while also drawing the initiative into larger strategic contests.
- Norms and historical narratives. The use of historical concepts (Intermarium) to frame contemporary cooperation highlights the potency of historical narratives in legitimating regional projects. India’s strategic culture likewise draws on historical self‑conceptions; framing connectivity and security initiatives in terms that resonate domestically and regionally can strengthen political support.

Concluding note
The Three Seas Initiative is a contemporary embodiment of an older strategic idea — that geography, when marshalled through cooperative infrastructure and energy policy, can be transformed into resilience and agency. For scholars and practitioners of India’s strategic culture, 3SI offers a compact case of how regional coalitions, defined by geographic corridors and practical projects, can change the balance of economic and strategic dependencies without recreating rigid alliance structures.

### The Three Seas Initiative: Dubrovnik Summit (25–26 August 2016) — Substance and Strategic Signals

Summary
- The inaugural Three Seas Initiative summit convened in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on 25–26 August 2016. It produced a joint declaration that set out an agenda of intensified economic cooperation concentrated on energy, transport and communications infrastructure. Beyond immediate project priorities, the summit projected a combined economic-development and strategic-security purpose and attracted salient external attention from both China and the United States.

Context and participants
- The Initiative was defined at the summit as a cooperative framework among twelve Central European states located between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas — the eponymous “three seas.” The participating countries were: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.
- Most members are also members of the European Union and of NATO; the Initiative therefore functions in a complementary, sometimes corrective, relationship with existing EU and NATO instruments — seeking to address persistent East–West gaps in infrastructure and interconnectivity within the Union.

Summit outcomes: declaration and thematic focus
- The Dubrovnik declaration emphasized regional connectivity as the primary vehicle for economic development and cohesion. It singled out three interlocking domains for practical cooperation:
  - Energy: interconnectors, diversification of supply, and resilience measures intended to reduce over-dependence on single suppliers.
  - Transport: cross-border highways, rail modernization and logistical links to integrate markets and shorten east–west transport bottlenecks.
  - Communications: digital and telecommunications infrastructure to close broadband and information-technology divides.
- Implicit in the text and tone of the declaration was a recognition that upgraded infrastructure serves both economic and strategic objectives — enabling economic convergence while strengthening collective resilience in a contested geopolitical environment.

Leadership framing and geographic definition
- Polish President Andrzej Duda — one of the Initiative’s most prominent champions — framed the project as a “new concept” for promoting European unity and cohesion from the middle of the continent outward. His articulation was both practical (infrastructure and investment) and normative (rebuilding a sense of European togetherness through tangible connectivity).
- Duda’s geographic framing — the twelve countries between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas — deliberately emphasised a contiguous regional bloc whose interests are distinct in emphasis from the EU’s western core. That spatial framing is central to the Initiative’s identity: it is a regional mechanism with a clear infrastructural agenda and a political subtext about balancing the center–periphery dynamics within Europe.

External participants and geopolitical signalling
- The Dubrovnik summit drew notable external participants and observers. China was represented by Liu Haixing, a ministerial assistant in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Liu presented China’s perspective by highlighting possible complementarities between the Three Seas connectivity agenda and elements of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). His presence and remarks signalled Chinese interest in deepening economic ties via infrastructure diplomacy in Central and Eastern Europe.
- From the United States, former National Security Advisor General James L. Jones attended and underscored the Initiative’s implications for European development and security. The American presence signalled U.S. support for initiatives that bolster transatlantic cohesion and reduce strategic dependencies in Europe.
- The simultaneous appearance of Chinese and American figures — and the public framing each brought — turned a seemingly regional infrastructure summit into a stage for competing external influence. The message was clear: infrastructure connectivity in Central Europe is now an arena of great-power interest and competition, in which economic projects carry strategic weight.

Institutional follow‑through: projects and financing
- The Initiative’s practical projects have included cross-border highways, rail modernization, energy interconnectors (including gas and electricity links), and digital/telecommunications upgrades. These are classic “connectivity” projects intended to produce immediate economic benefits while increasing strategic resilience.
- Recognizing the financing challenge, proponents established the Three Seas Investment Fund as a mechanism to mobilize capital for priority projects. Designed as a public–private investment vehicle, the Fund aims to leverage national contributions, private investment and, potentially, external financing to bridge infrastructure funding gaps.

Strategic implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture
- The Dubrovnik summit illustrates several lessons relevant to any state that treats infrastructure as a tool of strategic policy — lessons directly pertinent to Indian strategic culture and national security planning:
  1. Infrastructure as a dual-purpose instrument: Physical connectivity projects can simultaneously promote economic development and reduce strategic vulnerabilities (for example, by diversifying energy supply routes). India’s own emphasis on connectivity (Act East, Neighborhood First, and selective engagement with regional corridors) reflects this convergence of ends.
  2. Regional coalitions can compensate for supranational gaps: The Three Seas Initiative arose in part to address perceived East–West imbalances within the EU’s infrastructure networks. For India, the model is a reminder that regional groupings — even informal ones — can be effective instruments to marshal political will and coordinate investment where larger institutions are slow or reluctant.
  3. Infrastructure diplomacy invites external competition: The Dubrovnik summit shows how infrastructure initiatives draw competing great‑power interest (e.g., BRI vs. transatlantic engagement). Indian policymakers must therefore anticipate external actors seeking influence through project finance and engage with clarity about strategic limits, partnership terms and geopolitical trade‑offs.
  4. Financing design matters: The Three Seas Investment Fund highlights the importance of credible financing architecture (public–private partnerships, blended finance) to translate declarations into built projects. India’s agencies and state-owned banks face analogous challenges when supporting cross‑border projects; institutional design is as consequential as diplomatic declarations.
  5. Middle-power leadership and normative framing: Poland’s leadership and rhetorical framing as a “new concept” shows how medium powers can shape regional agendas. India, similarly positioned as a rising regional power with global aspirations, can use coherent framing and practical institutions to marshal coalition action that aligns with its strategic culture.

Conclusion
- The Dubrovnik summit of the Three Seas Initiative therefore serves as a compact case study in how a regional connectivity initiative operates at the intersection of economic policy and strategic competition. For Indian strategists, it underlines the instrumental value of infrastructure diplomacy, the need for robust financing mechanisms, and the inevitability that connectivity projects will be arenas of external influence requiring calibrated policy responses.

## Case Study: Three Seas Initiative — Warsaw Summit (6–7 July 2017) and the Establishment of the Three Seas Business Forum

Overview and context
- Event: The Warsaw summit of the Three Seas Initiative (TSI), the forum’s second summit, convened on 6–7 July 2017 in Warsaw, Poland.  
- Membership and purpose: The TSI brings together twelve European Union member states situated between the Adriatic, Baltic and Black Seas with an explicit focus on enhancing regional connectivity — principally in energy, transport and digital infrastructure. The Warsaw meeting followed the Initiative’s launch (first summit in 2016) and represented an early, formative effort to move from rhetorical cooperation toward institutionalized mechanisms and tangible project pipelines.

Notable attendance and geopolitical signalling
- High-profile presence: U.S. President Donald Trump attended the Warsaw summit as a guest. Although the TSI is a regional EU forum, the appearance of a sitting U.S. president elevated the event’s geopolitical visibility.  
- Significance: Presidential attendance by a non-European great power conveyed explicit signaling: the United States was prepared to lend political weight — and potentially policy and financial support — to regional infrastructure and security cooperation that counters strategic dependency (notably on single suppliers of energy and transport routes). For scholars of strategic culture, the episode illustrates how external great-power engagement can be instrumentalized by regional actors to bolster autonomy and diversify strategic options.

Decision: the Three Seas Business Forum
- Policy decision: Participating states unanimously agreed to establish the Three Seas Business Forum. The unanimity of this decision is analytically important: it indicates a shared perception among diverse member capitals that mobilizing non-state actors was necessary to accelerate project delivery and financing.  
- Purpose and mechanisms: The Business Forum was designed to function as a bridge between public objectives and private capital — mobilizing private-sector investment and structuring public–private partnerships (PPPs) for cross-border projects in energy, transport and digital infrastructure. In practice, this meant creating channels for banks, institutional investors and corporations to engage in project identification, risk assessment and co-financing.

Institutional and political implications
- From forum to pipeline: The Warsaw summit marked an early step in institutionalizing the TSI — moving it beyond summitry into mechanisms capable of generating concrete project pipelines. Establishing a business-focused instrument reflected pragmatic recognition that public budgets alone were insufficient for the scale of needed investment.  
- Consensus as policy capital: The unanimous agreement underscored intra-regional consensus on priorities (connectivity, energy diversification, digitalization) despite differing national interests. Such consensus provides political capital that can be leveraged to attract external partners and to negotiate project terms that respect member sovereignty.

Relevance to Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- Comparative lessons on connectivity diplomacy: For India, which increasingly pursues regional connectivity initiatives (digital corridors, maritime partnerships, and infrastructure investments), the TSI–Warsaw episode offers a template for combining multilateral political signaling, external great-power engagement and private-sector mobilization to pursue strategic objectives.  
- Managing great-power engagement: The U.S. presidential presence at Warsaw demonstrates how non-regional great powers can be courted to legitimize and underwrite regional initiatives without ceding leadership. Indian policymakers may draw lessons about calibrating third‑party involvement — using external support to diversify dependencies while preserving indigenous strategic autonomy.  
- Institutionalizing partnerships: The creation of a dedicated business forum within a political initiative highlights a pragmatic institutional choice: separating political coordination from investment facilitation can make an initiative more attractive to private capital. For India’s national security planners, this separation is salient when designing connectivity projects that have both civilian economic and strategic military implications; clear institutional channels can assuage investor concerns about political risk.

Concluding observation
The Warsaw summit of July 2017 — and the unanimous establishment of the Three Seas Business Forum with visible U.S. endorsement — exemplifies how regional actors combine political consensus, external partnerships and market mechanisms to operationalize connectivity and resilience. For students of strategic culture, it is an instructive case of how normative goals (regional unity, diversification) are translated into institutional instruments that bridge state preferences and private resources, a dynamic with clear parallels and lessons for Indian strategic practice.

### Case study: Third Three Seas Initiative (3SI) Summit — Bucharest, 17–18 September 2018

The Third Three Seas Initiative summit, convened in Bucharest on 17–18 September 2018, is illustrative of a contemporary regional connectivity project that combines political signalling, institutional innovation and nascent financial engineering to advance cross‑border infrastructure. The summit is notable less for immediate delivery of large projects than for building a pipeline, mobilising private sector interest, and securing high‑level political backing for three strategic infrastructure pillars: transport, energy and digital interconnection.

Key outcomes and institutional steps
- Approval of interconnection projects in three priority areas — transport, energy and digital — intended to enhance regional connectivity and economic integration across Central and Eastern Europe. These pillars were framed as mutually reinforcing components of regional resilience and competitiveness.
- High‑level political attendance: European Commission President Jean‑Claude Juncker, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry participated, signalling support from both EU institutions and strategic external partners. Their presence amplified the Initiative’s diplomatic weight and signalled that 3SI was not merely a regional forum but also a platform of transatlantic interest.
- Private sector engagement: The first edition of the Three Seas Business Forum was organised alongside the leaders’ summit to attract industry, financiers and developers into the project pipeline. This represented an explicit turn toward public–private modalities for project delivery.
- Institutional networking: A 3SI Network of Chambers of Commerce was created to link national chambers across the region, institutionalising channels for business input, cross‑border project identification and commercial matchmaking.
- Financing steps: Leaders signed a letter of intent regarding the establishment of a Three Seas Investment Fund — a political commitment to create a vehicle aimed at mobilising capital for mid‑sized cross‑border infrastructure projects. Importantly, the letter of intent is a preliminary political instrument and not equivalent to a legally operational fund.

Substantive priorities: why transport, energy and digital matter
- Transport: Trans‑border transport corridors lower the cost of trade, integrate supply chains and create alternative routes that reduce geographic bottlenecks. For Central and Eastern Europe, improved rail and road links are central to economic convergence.
- Energy: Projects in electricity interconnection, gas diversification and LNG/regasification capacity are aimed at reducing dependency on single suppliers and enhancing collective energy security — a strategic objective with explicit geopolitical dimensions in the region.
- Digital: Cross‑border broadband, fibre‑optic routes, data connectivity and cooperative cybersecurity measures underpin competitiveness in the modern economy and reduce asymmetric dependencies in information infrastructure.

Political and practical significance
- The visible involvement of EU and U.S. officials both legitimised the Initiative and transformed it into an instrument of broader geopolitical signalling: subsidiarity in infrastructure, counter‑vulnerabilities in energy flows, and a European–transatlantic alignment around connectivity.
- The Business Forum and the Network of Chambers illustrate an operational logic: political endorsement alone does not build infrastructure — sustained private sector engagement and institutional mechanisms for project pipeline development are necessary to translate plans into deliverables.
- The letter of intent for an investment fund underscores a recurring pattern in multilateral infrastructure diplomacy: political consensus and expressions of intent precede—and are distinct from—the complex legal, financial and due‑diligence work required to create a functioning regional investment vehicle.

Relevance and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although the Three Seas Initiative is geographically European, the Bucharest summit offers several analytic lessons of direct relevance to Indian strategic planners and scholars of India’s strategic culture:

- Connectivity as strategy: Like 3SI, India frames connectivity (land, sea, energy, and digital) as a central instrument of influence and security (see India’s Act East, SAGAR and neighbourhood initiatives). The 3SI model reinforces how infrastructural interdependence can be marshalled to promote economic integration while advancing strategic resilience.
- Diversification and energy security: The emphasis on energy interconnections and diversification resonates with India’s long‑standing pursuit of diversified energy suppliers and routes. Indian policy should note how regional coalitions can reduce supplier leverage and how infrastructure projects carry geopolitical implications beyond economics.
- Political backing matters for leverage: The added diplomatic weight that EU and U.S. participation gave 3SI shows the multiplier effect of external political endorsement. For India, cultivating broad coalitions (regional partners plus like‑minded external powers) can similarly enhance the feasibility of cross‑border projects, but it also requires careful balancing to avoid negative signalling to other stakeholders.
- Private‑sector engines and institutional bridges: The Business Forum and Network of Chambers exemplify mechanisms to involve industry and create a steady project pipeline. India’s national and subnational agencies, development finance institutions and chambers can emulate such institutional bridges to mobilise capital and improve project bankability.
- Financial realism: The letter of intent for a Three Seas Investment Fund is a reminder that political pledges are only the first step. Operationalising an investment vehicle requires rigorous legal structuring, credit enhancement, risk‑sharing mechanisms and a clear project pipeline — areas where India’s planners have both experience and ongoing lessons to apply.
- Strategic culture: The 3SI case highlights an aspect of strategic culture in liberal democracies: using multilateral, sectoral initiatives to bind states through mutually beneficial infrastructure and normative frameworks rather than through security pacts alone. For India, which prizes strategic autonomy, emulating selective, interest‑based connectivity partnerships can advance objectives without compromising independence.

Concluding observations
The Bucharest summit of the Three Seas Initiative in September 2018 exemplifies how regional connectivity initiatives combine political symbolism, private‑sector mobilisation and nascent financial engineering to address strategic infrastructure deficits. For Indian strategic thinkers, the summit’s mix of high‑level endorsement, institutional experimentation (business forums, chamber networks) and the tentative step of an investment fund offer concrete lessons about designing connectivity projects that are economically viable and politically sustainable while mindful of broader geopolitical signalling.

### 7.3 The Three Seas Initiative (2016–2025): A Decadal Chronology and Its Strategic Lessons for India

The Three Seas Initiative (3SI) is a regional forum of Central and Eastern European states focused on interconnecting energy, transport and digital infrastructure across the north–south axis between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. Launched as a platform for pragmatic infrastructure cooperation, 3SI has evolved into a diplomatic instrument that attracts sustained high-level external interest (notably from the United States, the European Commission and international financial institutions) and, increasingly, non‑European strategic partners. The following concise chronology of the annual summits (2016–2025) is followed by analytical observations and the strategic implications relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

Chronology of Summits (2016–2025)
- Summit 1 — 2016 (25–26 August), Dubrovnik, Croatia. Host: President Kolinda Grabar‑Kitarović. Note: Format of the Three Seas Initiative summit established.  
- Summit 2 — 2017 (6–7 July), Warsaw, Poland. Host: President Andrzej Duda. Note: U.S. President Donald Trump attended (high‑profile US presence).  
- Summit 3 — 2018 (17–18 September), Bucharest, Romania. Host: President Klaus Iohannis. Note: Attendees included European Commission President Jean‑Claude Juncker, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  
- Summit 4 — 2019 (5–6 June), Ljubljana, Slovenia. Host: President Borut Pahor. Note: Attendees included European Commission President Jean‑Claude Juncker, German President Frank‑Walter Steinmeier, and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.  
- Summit 5 — 2020 (19 October), Tallinn, Estonia. Host: President Kersti Kaljulaid. Note: Summit held virtually (COVID‑19 context).  
- Summit 6 — 2021 (8–9 July), Sofia, Bulgaria. Host: President Rumen Radev. Note: Greek President Katerina Sakellaropoulou attended.  
- Summit 7 — 2022 (20–21 June), Riga, Latvia. Host: President Egils Levits. Note: No specific external‑attendee notes listed.  
- Summit 8 — 2023 (6–7 September), Bucharest, Romania. Host: President Klaus Iohannis. Note: IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva attended; Greece became the 13th member and Moldova a partner‑participant.  
- Summit 9 — 2024 (11 April), Vilnius, Lithuania. Host: President Gitanas Nausėda. Note: Japan became the 4th Strategic Partner of the Initiative.  
- Summit 10 — 2025 (28–29 April), Warsaw, Poland. Host: President Andrzej Duda. Note: Albania and Montenegro became partner‑participants.

Analytical observations
- Institutionalisation and format. The inaugural Dubrovnik meeting (2016) established the summit format: an annual rotating‑host model that combines heads‑of‑state diplomacy, ministerial fora and project‑level convenings. Rotating hosts enable member states to prioritise national projects and use the platform for domestic signalling and bilateral outreach.
- High‑level external engagement. Summits attracting U.S. presidents and cabinet members (2017, 2018, 2019), European Commission presidents (2018, 2019) and IMF leadership (2023) demonstrate that 3SI is both economic and geopolitical in character: a vehicle for mobilising political backing, technical assistance and finance for infrastructure projects that have strategic implications (energy security, connectivity).
- Operational continuity despite disruption. The 2020 virtual summit illustrates resilience in summit diplomacy and the ability — but also the limits — of virtual formats to sustain momentum for complex, financing‑heavy infrastructure projects.
- Expansion and outreach. Membership enlargement and the growing roster of partner‑participants and strategic partners (Greece, Moldova, Japan, Albania, Montenegro) indicate widening geographic reach and external interest. Designation of Japan as a Strategic Partner (2024) is particularly significant: it signals trans‑regional interest by an Asian economic power in European connectivity projects and opens avenues for third‑country financing, technology and investment.
- Financing and economic dimensions. Presence of the IMF and repeated appeals to external finance point to the Initiative’s dependence on multilayered financing solutions — public funds, multilateral institutions and private investment — to translate summit commitments into deliverable projects.

Key takeaways by year (concise)
- 2016 — Institutional foundation and format set.  
- 2017 — High‑profile U.S. engagement elevates geopolitical salience.  
- 2018–2019 — Sustained EU and transatlantic political continuity consolidates legitimacy.  
- 2020 — Pandemic forces virtual diplomacy; implementation stresses visible.  
- 2023–2025 — Expansion of membership and strategic partnerships; broader financing dialogue (IMF engagement); outreach beyond Europe (Japan).

Relevance and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although geographically distinct, the Three Seas Initiative offers practical and conceptual lessons for India’s approach to regional cooperation, infrastructure diplomacy and strategic partnerships:

1. Summit diplomacy as platform for national priorities
   - Lesson: Rotating‑host, summit‑led formats allow states to synchronise national infrastructure priorities with a multilateral agenda. For India, similar summit platforms (e.g., BIMSTEC, Indo‑Pacific fora) can be used to spotlight domestic connectivity projects and attract partnership or financing.

2. Linking infrastructure to strategic objectives
   - Lesson: 3SI demonstrates how infrastructure (energy, transport, digital) is both an economic good and a security asset. India’s infrastructure diplomacy — including maritime connectivity and digital partnerships — should be designed with explicit strategic and resilience metrics (redundancy, supply‑chain security, secure communications).

3. External strategic partners and trans‑regional outreach
   - Lesson: Japan’s elevation to Strategic Partner of 3SI shows the value of inviting like‑minded external powers to deepen resources and technology pools without compromising regional agency. India can similarly calibrate partnerships (Japan, EU, U.S.) for projects where its agency and strategic autonomy are preserved, while deriving fiscal and technological benefits.

4. Mobilising multilateral finance and institutional backing
   - Lesson: The IMF’s involvement at 3SI highlights the importance of engaging multilateral finance institutions early to de‑risk projects and crowd in private capital. India should strengthen linkages between its project pipelines (national and regional) and multilaterals (ADB, AIIB, World Bank) to improve bankability.

5. Diplomacy under stress and continuity mechanisms
   - Lesson: The 2020 virtual summit underscores the need for contingency tools to maintain diplomatic momentum. India’s national security apparatus should institutionalise remote negotiation and project monitoring capabilities to ensure continuity during crises.

6. Geopolitical signalling and balancing
   - Lesson: High‑level external participation (notably U.S. presidents or cabinet members) turns infrastructure forums into theatres for geopolitical signalling. India’s strategic culture, which prizes strategic autonomy, must nonetheless recognise when high‑level involvement enhances deterrence, financing or technical capacity and when it risks entanglement.

Concluding reflection
The Three Seas Initiative is an instructive case of how a regional, sectoral infrastructure forum can mature into a multilateral instrument with economic, political and strategic salience. For Indian policymakers and strategists, 3SI offers a compact primer on converting connectivity rhetoric into deliverable projects while managing external partnerships, financing needs and the political dynamics of summit diplomacy. Emulating its strengths — institutional stability, partner diversification, and the marriage of finance with political support — can strengthen India’s own regional engagement strategies, provided that India retains clarity about where partnerships serve core national security interests and where they might dilute strategic autonomy.

### The Three Seas Initiative: Connectivity Projects, Energy Diversification, and Lessons for Indian Strategic Culture

Context and political framing
- The Three Seas Initiative (TSI) emerged in a period of renewed geopolitical attention to European regional connectivity. U.S. political engagement—symbolized by President Donald Trump’s visit to Poland in July 2017—helped crystallize American interest in Central and Eastern European infrastructure as part of a broader strategy of supporting partners and diversifying European energy links. The first major summit under the contemporary TSI framework took place in Bucharest in 2018, consolidating political commitment among participating states and signalling an intent to translate diplomatic rhetoric into tangible cross‑border projects.

What the Three Seas Initiative is
- The TSI is a regional forum of Central and Eastern European European Union members focused on strengthening north–south connectivity across three sectors: transport, energy and digital. Its strategic rationale rests on three linked aims:
  - Diversifying energy supplies and pathways to reduce dependency on single external suppliers;
  - Improving physical transport and digital links to deepen EU cohesion and economic development between Baltic, Adriatic and Black Sea littorals;
  - Enhancing regional resilience and security through integrated infrastructure that reduces vulnerabilities and enhances interoperability.

Major infrastructure projects associated with the TSI
- Two projects are often highlighted as central to the Initiative’s narrative of north–south integration:

  1. Via Carpathia (road)
     - A proposed north–south highway corridor intended to connect Klaipėda (Lithuania) in the Baltics to Thessaloniki (Greece) in the southern Balkans. Via Carpathia aims to create a continuous arterial road boosting trade, mobility and military mobility across the Carpathian arc.

  2. LNG infrastructure and interconnectors (energy)
     - A focus on liquefied natural gas to diversify gas supply sources. Key elements include operational and planned sea terminals (for example, Poland’s Świnoujście terminal and the proposed Krk terminal in Croatia) linked by proposed pipelines or connectivity projects to create alternative routes and reduce dependence on single pipelines from dominant suppliers.

- Additional transport and rail projects often associated with the TSI portfolio:
  - Baltic–Adriatic Corridor
  - Via Baltica road
  - Rail Baltica (modern rail link integrating the Baltic states with the EU standard gauge network)
  - Amber Rail Freight Corridor

- Rail‑2‑Sea
  - A more ambitious rail link proposal to connect the Baltic port of Gdańsk (Poland) with the Black Sea port of Constanța (Romania). The project has been discussed as a corridor of roughly 3,663 km (as commonly cited in program materials), intended to facilitate north–south freight movement and strategic redundancy.

Financing, implementation and status
- Financing model: Implementation relies on a mix of national budgets, the Three Seas Investment Fund (a multilateral vehicle created to attract capital for TSI projects), EU instruments, and private or U.S. investment. The cross‑border nature of projects necessitates coordination of regulatory standards, procurement, and co‑financing across different legal and budgetary systems.
- Status snapshots:
  - Świnoujście (Poland) — operational LNG terminal and a concrete example of supply diversification already realised.
  - Krk (Croatia) — the LNG terminal project has advanced as an interconnection option, though full realisation depends on further investment and pipeline links.
  - Road and rail corridors — projects such as Via Carpathia and Rail‑2‑Sea are at varied stages: some segments are under construction or upgraded, others remain in planning, feasibility or diplomatic negotiation stages.

Strategic implications and lessons for India
- The TSI offers several relevant lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy, especially in domains where India is expanding its external connectivity and infrastructure diplomacy:
  - Connectivity as strategic policy: Like the TSI, India’s Act East/Neighbourhood First policies and connectivity projects (land and maritime) blend economic development with strategic redundancy. Infrastructure is political: road, rail and port links can be instruments of influence, resilience and deterrence.
  - Energy diversification and security: The TSI’s emphasis on LNG terminals and interconnectors underscores how diversification reduces single‑supplier vulnerabilities. For India—balancing energy imports from multiple partners—this provides a useful template for combining domestic infrastructure, strategic reserves and international partnerships.
  - Financing models and fund architecture: The TSI experience shows the importance of blended financing (national, multilateral funds, private and allied-state investment). India’s institutions (e.g., lines of credit, development finance arms, and participation in multilateral funds) can be calibrated to attract private capital while safeguarding strategic interests.
  - Cross‑border coordination and interoperability: Successful corridors require harmonised standards, customs procedures and legal frameworks. India’s transnational projects (rail/road links with neighbors, port partnerships) will need similar institutional mechanisms to reduce implementation risk.
  - The role of external actors: U.S. political backing and private investment have been important to TSI momentum. India must therefore consider how partnerships with extra‑regional powers (U.S., EU, Japan) can be structured to support connectivity goals without compromising strategic autonomy.
  - Counterpoint to alternative models: The TSI illustrates a regional strategy that is complementary to, but also competitive with, other large‑scale connectivity programmes. For India, the comparative governance model—projects driven by multilateral coordination among sovereign states rather than primarily bilateral or state‑company led models—may be an attractive option in certain contexts.

Concluding remarks
- The Three Seas Initiative is a practical case study in how regional infrastructure can be marshalled for strategic ends: diversification of energy, strengthening of regional cohesion, and creation of redundancy in critical supply chains. For Indian scholars and policymakers, TSI offers concrete examples—both achievements (Świnoujście LNG) and ongoing challenges (transnational rail/road implementation)—from which to draw lessons on financing, diplomatic coordination, and the operationalisation of connectivity as a component of national security policy.

## Case Study: The Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund (3SIIF)

This short case study examines the Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund (3SIIF) as a model of regional infrastructure finance: its origin, governance, financial ambition, operational design, and the strategic risks and opportunities it embodies. Although the 3SIIF is a European initiative, its structure and challenges carry clear lessons for policymakers and strategists concerned with infrastructure-driven connectivity, energy security and the mobilization of private capital — themes central to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### Background and founding commitments
- The 3SIIF was launched within the framework of the Three Seas Initiative (TSI), a regional forum of 12 European Union countries located between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. The Initiative seeks to enhance transport, energy and digital connectivity across Central and Eastern Europe.
- In 2019 Poland’s state development bank, Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK), and Romania’s export–import/state-backed bank (Export–Import Bank of Romania, EximBank) signed the founding act establishing the Fund. The two founding institutions committed payments totaling more than €500 million.
- The Fund is open to accession by other Three Seas countries, subject to obtaining the appropriate permits — reflecting a membership model that is both state-led and permissive of expansion.

### Governance and management
- The supervisory board comprises representatives of development banks from Poland, Romania, Latvia and the Czech Republic. This composition signals a public-sector-led governance architecture with explicit commercial ambitions.
- To manage and commercialize investments, the Fund is collaborating with Amber Infrastructure Group — a private infrastructure manager engaged to raise capital and oversee investments, thereby introducing professional private-sector fund management into the governance mix.

### Objectives and investment scope
- Investment focus: transport, energy, and digital infrastructure within the Three Seas region — sectors that underpin connectivity, economic resilience and strategic diversification (notably energy).
- Sectoral emphasis and geographic remit establish the 3SIIF as a vehicle for projects that have both economic returns and geopolitical significance (e.g., energy interconnectors, cross-border corridors).

### Capital targets, leverage strategy and project scale
- Fundraising aim: to raise between €3 billion and €5 billion in capital from a mix of public and private sources.
- Private investors — pension funds, private investment funds and related institutional actors — are explicitly invited to participate. This is intended to diversify sources but also raises the need for market-rate returns and rigorous risk management.
- On a commercial basis the Fund plans to engage in infrastructure projects with a total value of up to €100 billion. Given this disproportion between fund capital and project pipeline, the 3SIIF is designed to act as anchor equity/co-investor and to use that positioning to mobilize substantial additional debt and equity from third parties.
- The estimated infrastructure needs of the Three Seas region exceed €570 billion, illustrating the massive financing gap the Fund is attempting to help close through leverage and syndication.

### Financial position and unrealized external pledges
- By 2023 the Fund’s assets were estimated at approximately €900 million — up from initial commitments of more than €500 million but still modest relative to both its fundraising target and the regional infrastructure needs.
- Ahead of the 2020 Tallinn Summit, the United States (then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo) pledged up to $1 billion to the Fund. That financing was not delivered, a visible example of the political and execution risks inherent in relying on external state-backed commitments.

### Strategic risks and mitigation levers
Key risks:
- Fundraising shortfall relative to the region’s €570B+ needs, and to the Fund’s own pipeline ambitions.
- Project bankability: many infrastructure projects require preparatory work, stable regulatory frameworks and revenue guarantees to be attractive to institutional investors.
- Political and regulatory risk across multiple jurisdictions with differing legal, procurement and permitting regimes.
- Currency and market risks, particularly for cross-border projects denominated in multiple currencies.
- Reputational and governance risks as public-sector banks and private fund managers coordinate investment decisions.

Operational levers and mitigation strategies:
- Blended finance structures that combine concessionary public capital or guarantees with private capital to improve bankability.
- Use of guarantees and political-risk insurance (where available) to attract institutional investors.
- Co-financing and partnership with multilateral lenders (EIB, EBRD) to enhance project due diligence and creditworthiness.
- Promotion of PPP frameworks and standardized procurement to reduce transaction costs and legal uncertainty.
- Syndication of loans and equity stakes to diversify investor base and spread risk.

### Benefits and strategic rationale
- If successfully deployed at scale, the Fund can improve regional connectivity, enable energy diversification, upgrade digital infrastructure and strengthen EU cohesion across the Three Seas countries.
- By anchoring projects and demonstrating commercial models, the 3SIIF can catalyze much larger flows of private capital into strategically important infrastructure.

### Implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Regional infrastructure funds can serve both commercial and strategic ends: they mobilize capital for connectivity while shaping the political economy of neighboring states. For India — which pursues connectivity and infrastructure diplomacy across the Indo-Pacific and neighbourhood — the 3SIIF offers relevant lessons:
  - The importance of anchoring public development finance with credible private fund management to attract institutional capital.
  - The need for realistic calibration of fund size versus regional needs, and for explicit leverage strategies (blended finance, guarantees, multilaterals).
  - The political risk of relying on high-profile external pledges; durable programs require legally binding commitments or diversified backstops.
  - Governance transparency and harmonized regulatory frameworks are critical to make cross-border projects bankable.
  - Strategic priorities (energy security, digital connectivity, transport corridors) benefit from an integrated investment strategy that aligns national security objectives with commercial project design.

### Monitoring priorities for stakeholders
To assess the Fund’s effectiveness and strategic impact, observers should monitor:
- Membership expansion and formal accession of additional Three Seas countries.
- Final capital raised and the composition of investors (public vs private; institutional quality).
- The pipeline of bankable projects: numbers, sectors, expected leverage ratios and co-financing partners.
- Governance transparency, procurement practices and conflict-of-interest safeguards.
- Co-financing arrangements with EIB/EBRD, utilization of guarantees and PPP frameworks.

Conclusion
The 3SIIF encapsulates the promise and complexity of contemporary regional infrastructure finance: modest seed capital and a public-sector lead can anchor far larger investment programs, but success depends on sophisticated risk-sharing, commercial discipline, and political steadiness. For strategists and policymakers in India, the Fund provides a compact study in how investment vehicles can be used to pursue connectivity and security objectives — and the institutional and financial choices that determine whether those vehicles deliver.

### Case Study: President Zoran Milanović's Rejection of the Three Seas Initiative — Implications for Domestic Politics and Regional Projects

Summary of the statement
- Subject and speaker: Croatian President Zoran Milanović — identified in public discourse and by himself as a social‑democratic politician.
- Content: Milanović publicly stated that the Three Seas Initiative (3SI) is harmful to Croatia.
- Tone and political meaning: The assessment is explicitly negative and frames the Initiative as contrary to Croatia’s national interest, signaling opposition rather than constructive amendment.

What this communicates (idea behind the statement)
- A head of state is using public voice to contest a multilateral regional project. Even where constitutional executive power is limited, such statements shape political debate and public perception.
- The remark implies a divergence between the president’s view and supporters of 3SI — possibly including elements of Croatia’s government, business constituencies, or international partners — and highlights the domestic political dimension of regional integration projects.

What is actually being talked about
- The substance is Croatia’s stance toward the Three Seas Initiative, expressed through its most prominent national political figure.
- The claim is normative and categorical: participation in, or the consequences of, 3SI would be detrimental to Croatian interests. The statement therefore functions as both policy judgment and political positioning.

Brief primer: the Three Seas Initiative (3SI)
- The 3SI is a regional cooperation forum of Central and Eastern European states focused on connectivity across the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. Its principal areas are infrastructure (transport corridors), energy projects (diversification and interconnectivity), and digital connectivity.
- It is a platform that mixes political signaling, project finance, and inter‑governmental coordination — frequently portrayed as a way to accelerate cross‑border projects that are otherwise slow to emerge from broader EU mechanisms.

Why a president might oppose 3SI: possible reasons (illustrative)
- Economic concerns: perceived disproportionate cost to the Croatian state, questionable cost‑benefit for particular projects, or fears that investments will accrue to other countries or private actors rather than to domestic priorities.
- Sovereignty and strategic alignment: concern that deeper participation could commit Croatia to geopolitical alignments or external dependencies that the president views as undesirable.
- Unequal distribution of benefits: worry that the structure of 3SI projects favors larger regional economies or foreign investors, leaving smaller states disadvantaged.
- Domestic political calculus: opposition may serve to differentiate the president from the government, appeal to particular constituencies, or reflect different strategic priorities within the domestic elite.

Potential consequences of the statement
- Domestic politics: the president’s stance can catalyze parliamentary debate, influence public opinion, and constrain or complicate executive diplomacy even if formal presidential powers are limited.
- Policy implementation: public opposition from the head of state can slow or reshape Croatia’s engagement with 3SI projects, affect procurement and partnership choices, and introduce uncertainty for developers and investors.
- Regional dynamics: Croatia’s skepticism may reduce cohesion within the 3SI, encourage other skeptical members to voice reservations, or prompt project re‑scoping to accommodate dissenting views.
- International perceptions: external partners and financiers may reassess risk, timing, or the strategic logic of projects that rely on stable inter‑state commitment.

Context required for fuller assessment
- Institutional context: the constitutional role of the Croatian presidency versus the government’s foreign‑policy prerogatives — to judge whether the statement is primarily symbolic or likely to have material effect.
- Temporal and political context: timing of the remark relative to domestic elections, government policy announcements, or specific 3SI project milestones.
- Project specifics: which 3SI initiatives are implicated, their financing models, and the distribution of anticipated benefits and burdens across Croatia.
- External factors: pressure or incentives from EU institutions, other 3SI members, or third‑country actors that might amplify or mitigate the president’s influence.

Analytical takeaway for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Domestic political actors — even those with limited formal authority — play an outsized role in shaping how a state approaches regional initiatives. India’s strategic culture similarly accommodates strong rhetorical leadership and periodic public contestation over external economic and security engagements.
- Planners and diplomats should anticipate and manage domestic narratives: initiatives that are technically sound can flounder if perceived as imposing unfair costs, reducing sovereignty, or producing inequitable benefits domestically.
- The Croatian example underscores two operational lessons for India: (1) secure broad domestic consensus (or at least mitigate elite divergence) before committing to multilateral projects that carry visible costs; (2) design transparency and benefit‑sharing measures that address political vulnerabilities and preempt nationalist or populist critiques.
- In sum, multinational projects are as much political as technical; understanding the interplay between domestic leadership statements and international cooperation is essential for coherent national security strategy.

### Case Study: Czechia and the Three Seas Initiative — From Skepticism to Selective Pragmatism

Summary
- Czechia’s initial reaction to the Three Seas Initiative (3SI) was one of political skepticism. Prague viewed the initiative largely as a Polish geopolitical project—one that risked reviving Intermarium-style regionalism and deepening an east–west cleavage within the European Union. Over time, however, Czech policy shifted away from outright political opposition toward selective, transactional cooperation focused on concrete infrastructure projects. Crucially, this shift did not translate into wholehearted institutional or financial commitment: Prague has avoided joining the Three Seas Investment Fund and has shown no interest in hosting a summit. The dominant Czech posture today is pragmatic and project-driven rather than ideological or leadership-oriented.

Origins of Czech Skepticism
- Early Czech discourse framed 3SI as an expression of Polish-led regional ambition. Commentators and diplomats invoked the historical Intermarium concept (the interwar idea of a Polish-centred federation of Central and Eastern European states) to warn that a new, narrowly regional bloc might emerge as a counterweight to existing European structures.
- Two linked fears animated Prague’s unease. First, that 3SI would institutionalize an east–west split inside the EU; second, that it might deliberately or inadvertently exclude Germany, weakening EU cohesion. For Czech policymakers committed to a stable, integrated Europe, any project perceived as a partial or competing geopolitical bloc was problematic.
- Beyond short-term calculations, a longer-term Czech objection was normative: Central Europe should not be the site of a rival geopolitical architecture that undermines pan-European institutions and processes.

Trajectory of Czech Policy: What Changed and Why
- The change was incremental and primarily pragmatic. Cooperative wins in Visegrád (V4) infrastructure planning eased some mistrust between Czechia and Poland, although the extent and permanence of that effect require careful verification.
- Domestic politics were consequential. The end of President Miloš Zeman’s term removed one domestic obstacle to rapprochement: under Zeman, Prague’s posture toward several regional initiatives had been more ambivalent or oppositional. A recalibration of government priorities opened space for more transactional engagement with 3SI-related projects.
- Concrete portfolio changes signalled the attitude shift. In 2023, Czech authorities removed the Danube–Odra–Labe (DOL) canal from their list of national priority projects. The canal had been a politically charged, high-profile flagship with major environmental, fiscal and cross-border implications—its de-prioritization reflected a broader move away from grandiose, controversial projects.
- At the same time, the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed new, more modest priorities: the STORK II gas interconnector (strengthening Czech–Polish energy links and regional energy security) and a high-speed rail connection to Poland. These choices illustrate the preference for realistic, economically demonstrable infrastructure initiatives over symbolic or geopolitically loaded undertakings.
- Despite cooperation on particular projects, Prague has avoided deeper institutional engagement: there is no indication that Czechia intends to join the Three Seas Investment Fund or to host a Three Seas summit. That reluctance underscores the distinction between transactional project cooperation and durable institutional commitment.

Key Projects and Institutional Stakes (brief)
- Intermarium: an historical reference point that has shaped perceptions; used rhetorically to warn against Polish-led regionalism.
- Visegrád Group (V4): an existing platform for Czech–Polish–Hungarian–Slovak cooperation. Positive V4 infrastructure work has helped lower political friction in some areas.
- STORK II: a planned gas interconnector valued for enhancing cross-border energy security and integration.
- Danube–Odra–Labe canal: a transboundary waterway initiative with significant environmental, financial and political controversy—its removal from priority status was symbolically important.
- Three Seas Investment Fund: the comparative reluctance to join this financing mechanism shows Czech caution about entangling financial commitments and governance alignment.
- German inclusion: perceptions about whether Germany is meaningfully engaged in 3SI shape Czech judgments about whether the initiative complements or undermines broader EU unity.

Implications for Regional Governance and Czech Foreign Policy
- Czech engagement is transactional and project-driven. Prague’s calculations emphasize demonstrable economic returns and feasible implementation over geopolitical leadership or contestation.
- Persistent institutional reluctance (no fund membership, no hosting) indicates limited willingness to deepen formal ties to a regional construct that still carries exclusionary connotations.
- The removal of the DOL canal from the priority list signals a broader Czech preference for manageable, less controversial projects—an explicit movement away from “flagship” projects that generate high political and environmental risk.
- For the 3SI to secure fuller Czech buy-in, the initiative needs to be framed and operationalized as complementary to EU integration and to include visible involvement from Germany and EU institutions. Absent such reassurance, Czech participation will likely remain selective.

Policy Recommendations (for practitioners and analysts)
- Frame 3SI projects explicitly as EU-complementary: minimize zero-sum framing and make clear how initiatives add value to EU cohesion and single-market objectives.
- Prioritize small-to-medium, high-impact infrastructure projects with clear and short-to-medium-term economic benefits (e.g., energy interconnectors, cross-border rail links) to build practical trust and reduce political friction.
- Engage Germany and EU institutions visibly in project design and financing to counter exclusionary perceptions and to strengthen political legitimacy.

Lessons for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy
- The Czech case offers compact lessons translatable to India’s strategic thinking when engaging in regional arrangements:
  - Favor project-driven cooperation over ideational or exclusionary blocs. Tangible projects that deliver economic or security value build durable trust.
  - Domestic political signals matter. Changes in leadership or domestic priorities can rapidly alter a state’s foreign-policy posture; external partners should calibrate expectations accordingly.
  - Inclusion of major regional powers (or multilateral institutions) can transform perception from “bloc-building” to “system-complementing.” For India, this argues for transparent, cooperative framing when leading or joining regional initiatives, especially where extra-regional great-power dynamics are salient.
  - De-prioritizing politically fraught flagship projects in favour of achievable infrastructure investments reduces risk and enhances credibility.

Concluding note
- Czechia’s experience with 3SI exemplifies how a medium power can manage between apprehension about regional geopolitical projects and the practical benefits of targeted cooperation. The prevailing Czech logic—pragmatic, selective engagement that preserves broader institutional alignments—offers a useful heuristic for states (including India) that aim to balance regional initiative-building with commitments to larger multilateral frameworks.

### Domestic Party Advocacy and External Initiatives: The Finns Party and the Three Seas Initiative — Analytical Note

Context: a domestic political actor — the Finns Party — has publicly advocated that Finland join the Three Seas Initiative. This short episode is useful as a case study of how sub-state political actors can insert themselves into debates about international alignments and regional infrastructure initiatives, and what that means for national security policy formulation.

1. Actor and descriptor
- Actor: the Finns Party — a domestic political party in Finland.
- Descriptor: commonly characterized as a “populist” party. This label is analytically significant because it signals certain political styles (appeals to a perceived popular will, scepticism of elites or supranational institutions) and strategic incentives (mobilising voters, leveraging symbolic foreign-policy positions).

2. Action and object
- Action: “has advocated” — the party is promoting a policy position; this is political advocacy rather than a binding governmental decision.
- Object: Finland joining the Three Seas Initiative — a regional forum of EU countries situated between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas that focuses on infrastructure, energy and connectivity projects.

3. Political interpretation
- Party position vs. government policy: The statement reports a partisan stance and therefore must be distinguished from formal state policy. Advocacy by a party signals that the issue has entered the domestic political agenda and could become a subject of parliamentary debate, coalition bargaining or electoral competition.
- Strategic signalling: A populist party’s promotion of external initiatives often seeks to shape public opinion, test lines of foreign-policy rhetoric, and extract concessions within coalition negotiations (for example, influencing cabinet portfolios or foreign-policy priorities if the party enters government).
- Policy salience: By raising the question of joining the Three Seas Initiative, the Finns Party can elevate the salience of regional energy and transport connectivity in domestic discourse, potentially reframing national priorities and budgetary attention.

4. Institutional and diplomatic requirements for joining
- Formal accession would typically require an executive decision (government approval), parliamentary oversight or ratification depending on domestic procedures, and diplomatic engagement with incumbent members of the Initiative.
- Practical steps would include bilateral consultations with member states, assessment of alignment between Initiative projects and Finland’s strategic priorities, and negotiation of commitments (financial, technical, political).

5. Benefits associated with participation
- Infrastructure linkages: access to coordinated projects improving transport and digital links across the region.
- Energy security: opportunities for cooperation on diversified energy supplies, cross-border grids, and projects reducing dependence on single suppliers.
- Economic opportunity: potential for Finnish firms to participate in regional contracts, and for Finland to benefit from enhanced trade and connectivity.

6. Considerations and potential constraints
- Strategic alignment: how participation aligns with Finland’s commitments within the EU and NATO (now a member), and whether it complements or complicates existing security partnerships.
- Domestic politics: the degree of parliamentary and public support; whether advocacy by a particular party is sufficient to generate a cross-party consensus.
- Costs and priorities: financial commitments, administrative capacity to engage in additional regional fora, and whether this initiative competes with other strategic investments.

7. Analytical takeaway for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- Domestic parties matter: This episode illustrates a general principle of interest to readers of Indian strategic culture: partisan actors can shift the terms of foreign-policy debate and create openings for new forms of regional engagement. Like Finland, India must consider how domestic political entrepreneurs shape discourse on external partnerships.
- From rhetoric to policy: Advocacy is the start of a process, not its conclusion. States convert partisan proposals into policy through institutional checks (executive decision-making, parliamentary debate, bureaucratic assessment) and external negotiation. For India, managing such transitions requires clear interagency processes and mechanisms to assess geopolitical, economic and security trade-offs.
- Strategic framing: Parties use foreign-policy proposals to signal preferences to domestic audiences and external actors alike. Understanding these signals helps anticipate policy shifts and the likely conditions under which a proposal might become official state policy.

Concluding note: The Finns Party’s advocacy for joining the Three Seas Initiative is a compact illustration of the interface between domestic politics and regional security-infrastructure fora. For students of strategic culture, it reinforces the importance of tracing how partisan initiative becomes state action — and how such trajectories influence national security priorities.

### Ukraine and the Three Seas Initiative: From Invitation to Partner-Participant — A Concise Case Study

Summary
- This case traces Ukraine’s evolving relationship with the Three Seas Initiative (TSI) from an initial 2016 invitation through episodic engagement and legal constraints, to a decisive political reorientation after the 2022 Russian invasion that produced a formal “partner‑participant” status at the June 2022 Riga summit. The progression illustrates how security shocks can accelerate the transformation of a regional infrastructure forum into a vehicle with broader geopolitical and resilience functions. For readers focused on India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the episode offers discrete lessons about external engagement in regionally‑bounded initiatives, the interaction of infrastructure and security, and the limits and possibilities of informal statuses short of full membership.

Chronology and key developments
- 2016: Invitation and non‑representation
  - Ukraine was invited to the TSI summit in Dubrovnik (the Initiative’s early years), but did not send a state representative. The invitation signalled an early recognition of Ukraine’s geographical and logistical relevance to the Baltic–Adriatic–Black Sea space; the absence of representation reflected both Ukraine’s priorities at the time and the Initiative’s primary identity as a forum of Central and Eastern European EU states.

- August–October 2019: Zelenskyy’s outreach and Polish caution
  - August 2019: On a state visit to Poland, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy publicly expressed Ukraine’s interest in active participation in regional projects linking the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. He highlighted ongoing cooperation on Via Carpatia (a major north–south trans‑European road corridor) and raised the prospect of the ambitious E‑40 inland waterway — a multimodal route conceptually linking the Baltic and Black Seas via river and canal connections.
  - October 2019: Poland’s Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz counterbalanced Zelenskyy’s overtures by noting that, at that stage, Ukraine could not join the TSI because the Initiative’s membership consisted of Central and Southern European EU states. He emphasized the TSI’s infrastructural, not geopolitical, character — an important rhetorical line aimed at containing expansionary expectations and maintaining a legally coherent membership axiom tied to EU membership.

- November 2019: Reiteration in Tallinn
  - Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s interest during a visit to Estonia, signalling persistence in Kyiv’s diplomatic effort to be operationally integrated in regional projects.

- May–June 2022: Security shock and accelerating advocacy
  - 22 May 2022: Following the Russian full‑scale invasion, Polish President Andrzej Duda addressed the Ukrainian parliament and declared that Ukraine should join the Three Seas Initiative — an explicit move from normative support to active advocacy.
  - 7 June 2022: Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki underscored that the TSI was “impossible without a free and sovereign Ukraine,” framing Ukraine’s inclusion as intrinsic to the Initiative’s long‑term viability.
  - 20 June 2022 (7th summit, Riga): President Zelenskyy spoke by video, explicitly urging full cooperation and membership, with emphasis on logistics and energy. He highlighted Ukraine’s substantial gas storage capacity as a regional asset for energy security and seasonal balancing.

- Riga 2022 outcome: partner‑participant status
  - At the Riga summit the TSI conferred on Ukraine a “partner‑participant” status — a political compromise that allowed substantive cooperation without extending full membership rights and responsibilities. Practically, this status rendered Ukraine an effective participant in TSI activities while preserving the Initiative’s formal EU‑centred membership premise.

Analytical unpacking: interests, instruments, and constraints
- Infrastructure as security: The TSI’s stated mandate is infrastructure (energy, transport, digital), yet the Ukraine case shows how infrastructure initiatives are also instruments of resilience and geopolitical orientation. Via Carpatia and the E‑40 waterway are not merely transport projects; they alter strategic lines of communication and economic interdependence across a contested space.

- Energy leverage: Ukraine’s gas storage holdings emerged as a bargaining chip. In configurations where energy security is salient, physical storage and network interconnectivity confer tangible leverage to a non‑EU actor seeking deeper regional integration.

- Legal and normative friction: The TSI’s historical link with EU membership created a legal and normative barrier to straightforward Ukrainian accession. The partner‑participant status illustrates how institutions can invent intermediate forms to reconcile legal norms with emergent political imperatives.

- Role of a regional patron (Poland): Poland acted as the principal advocate for Ukrainian inclusion. This demonstrates how middle powers within regional mechanisms can shape enlargement dynamics, especially when security relationships with an aspirant partner intensify.

- From infrastructure to geopolitics: Inclusion of Ukraine portends a shift in the TSI’s functional balance. What began as an infrastructure forum risks becoming a conduit for broader security cooperation and political signalling vis‑à‑vis Russia — a development that some members welcome and others may view as risky or divisive.

Practical integration challenges
- Technical alignment: Integrating Ukraine into TSI projects requires harmonization with EU standards (e.g., TEN‑T corridors), cross‑border regulatory coordination, and financing mechanisms compatible with EU and multilateral funds.

- Funding and implementation: Ambitious transnational ventures like E‑40 are technically complex and costly. Political will must translate into sustained funding commitments, feasibility studies, and environmental assessments.

- Geopolitical risk management: Deeper TSI–Ukraine ties could prompt Russian countermeasures and produce friction within the EU among members cautious about expanding the Initiative’s scope in ways that might escalate confrontation.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Selective engagement in regionally bounded initiatives: India often operates through coalitions and minilateral groupings. The TSI–Ukraine episode underscores the utility of flexible participation formats (e.g., partner or observer statuses) that permit practical cooperation without immediate legal accession — a model India can both emulate and offer in its external partnerships.

- Infrastructure as a security instrument: For India, investing in and shaping regional infrastructure (connectivity, digital, energy) is an instrument of strategic influence. The TSI case reinforces that infrastructure policy must be integrated with geopolitical assessments and resilience planning.

- Importance of middle‑power advocacy: Poland’s role mirrors how states like India can act as conveners and champions for partners in regional fora. Strategic culture that values long‑term partnership can convert normative support into institutional access for allies.

- Managing expansion vs. coherence trade‑offs: India should note the institutional tensions between maintaining a forum’s original legal identity and adapting it to new political exigencies. Pragmatic compromise (partner‑participant) can be effective, but must be accompanied by clear frameworks to avoid mission creep.

Conclusion
- Ukraine’s path to “partner‑participant” status in the TSI encapsulates how security shocks can remap the boundaries of regional initiatives, converting infrastructural cooperation into strategic solidarity. The episode is a useful, compact case for analysts of strategic culture: it highlights how institutional forms are adapted under pressure, the centrality of infrastructure to resilience, and the role of middle powers in recalibrating regional architecture — all points with direct relevance to India’s external policy toolkit.
