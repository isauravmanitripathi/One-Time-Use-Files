# Monetary union in Africa

## UEMOA (Union économique et monétaire ouest‑africaine / WAEMU)

Overview
- UEMOA is a treaty‑based monetary and economic union of eight West African states. Its principal goals are to promote monetary and financial stability and to deepen economic integration across its members through common policy frameworks, supranational institutions and a shared currency.
- The union is sometimes referenced in English as WAEMU; the common currency is the West African CFA franc (ISO 4217: XOF), historically pegged first to the French franc and, since the euro’s creation, to the euro. The peg and institutional links with France have been—and remain—important elements in debates about sovereignty, regional autonomy and external influence.

Membership and historical background
- Current members: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea‑Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo.
- Seven of these eight members were formerly part of French West Africa; Guinea‑Bissau is the exception (a former Portuguese colony). This colonial history helps explain linguistic, legal and institutional commonalities across most UEMOA states and the continued monetary arrangements linking the CFA franc to European institutions.
- From 1962 until 1994 the entity was commonly known as the West African Monetary Union (WAMU or UMOA in French); the 1994 treaty framework created today’s UEMOA with an expanded integration agenda beyond pure monetary coordination.

Territorial and regional context
- UEMOA is territorially almost coterminous with a portion of ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States), but the two institutions differ in scope: ECOWAS is the wider regional political and economic community (Anglophone, Francophone and Lusophone states), while UEMOA is the smaller monetary union of largely francophone states that share the CFA franc.
- Cape Verde is an example of an ECOWAS member that lies outside the UEMOA/CFA zone: it participates fully in ECOWAS but uses the Cape Verdean escudo rather than the CFA franc.
- Related sub‑regional monetary architecture exists elsewhere in Africa: CEMAC (in Central Africa) uses the Central African CFA franc (XAF). XOF (UEMOA) and XAF (CEMAC) are distinct currencies although they share an historical lineage.

Institutions and governance (and their locations)
UEMOA combines political organs, supranational economic governance and independent financial supervisors. Important organs and their seats include:
- Top political bodies
  - Council of Heads of State (Conférence des Chefs d’État et de Gouvernement) — supreme political decision‑making organ.
  - Council of Ministers — executive coordination on policy and regulation.
- Supranational governance and oversight (Ouagadougou)
  - Commission (the executive secretariat), Court of Justice and Court of Accounts are based in Ouagadougou, providing legal adjudication, oversight and executive coordination within the union.
- Central banking (Dakar)
  - Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is headquartered in Dakar. The BCEAO issues the XOF, formulates regional monetary policy, and oversees banking stability across UEMOA members.
- Financial supervision and markets (Abidjan)
  - Banking Commission of the West African Monetary Union (CB‑UMOA) and the Financial Markets Authority (AMF‑UMOA) are based in Abidjan, responsible for banking regulation and capital‑market governance respectively.
- Development and insurance bodies
  - West African Development Bank (BOAD) is headquartered in Lomé and functions as the regional development finance institution for UEMOA members.
  - The Regional Insurance Control Commission (CRCA) is located in Libreville and serves insurance regulation for the Franc Zone; it is shared functionally across several francophone monetary arrangements.

Adjacent initiatives
- WAMZ (West African Monetary Zone) is an ECOWAS initiative, distinct from UEMOA, that seeks monetary harmonization among mainly Anglophone and other non‑CFA ECOWAS members with a longer‑term aim of a common currency for that grouping. WAMZ highlights the linguistic and monetary cleavage inside ECOWAS between CFA and non‑CFA members and different paths toward integration.

Strategic and policy implications (brief analytical note for readers of this book)
- External anchor and sovereignty trade‑offs: UEMOA illustrates how a regional currency pegged to an external currency (first the French franc, now the euro) can deliver monetary stability and low inflation but also constrains independent monetary policy. For strategic actors (including middle powers such as India engaging in Africa), the CFA model underscores how monetary arrangements can embed long‑term geopolitical ties and influence.
- Institutional architecture and regional cohesion: UEMOA’s multilayered governance — political councils, supranational courts, a regional central bank and specialized financial supervisors — shows that a stable monetary union requires complementary institutions beyond simple currency arrangements. These institutions also become vectors of regional leadership and hubs for external engagement (BCEAO in Dakar, BOAD in Lomé, etc.).
- Development finance and economic statecraft: BOAD and regional supervisors offer entry points for external partners. For states pursuing strategic partnerships in West Africa, engagement with regional banks and supervisors can be as important as bilateral state‑to‑state links.
- Comparative lessons for India: for policymakers concerned with regional stability and integration, UEMOA presents trade‑offs between deeper integration and national policy autonomy, and demonstrates the importance of legal/institutional capacity for monetary union success. India’s own regional initiatives (and its assistance or investment strategies in Africa) can draw lessons on sequencing integration, respecting local political economy realities (including colonial legacies), and balancing influence with support for institutional autonomy.

This concise profile of UEMOA foregrounds the union’s institutional design, historical roots and strategic resonance — material that is useful for comparative reflection on how monetary arrangements intersect with sovereignty, external influence and regional security‑economic policymaking.

## France’s Colonial Currency Architecture after 1945 — Institutional Evolution and Strategic Implications

Context and main argument  
In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War France undertook a decisive monetary realignment at home that it deliberately did not fully replicate in its overseas possessions. Rather than uniformly revaluing colonial currency relationships to mirror metropolitan changes, Paris created and maintained distinct, administered currency arrangements — most prominently the CFA and CFP francs — that preserved monetary parity or managed exchange relations on terms set largely by the metropole. The institutional history of the CFA franc in West Africa, tracing the issuance privilege from the Banque de l'Afrique Occidentale (BAO) through an Institut d’Émission to the Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) by 1959, illustrates how metropolitan monetary policy was exported and embedded in colonial institutions. This export carried long-term consequences for economic sovereignty, exchange-rate management, and the strategic posture of newly independent states.

1. The 1945 devaluation and selective extension of monetary change  
- In 1945, following liberation, France devalued the metropolitan franc as part of broader postwar stabilization.  
- Crucially, France did not simply apply the same devaluation to all overseas territories. Instead it treated colonies differently depending on political, economic, and strategic considerations.  
- To preserve a controlled relation between the metropole and selected overseas territories, Paris established distinct colonial currencies that maintained a fixed or administered parity with the metropolitan franc.

2. The mosaic of colonial currencies: CFA, CFP, piastre, and the metropolitan franc  
- CFA franc (Colonies Françaises d'Afrique): Created to preserve parity and monetary continuity in large parts of French West and Equatorial Africa. The CFA was explicitly designed to be linked to the French franc, thereby institutionalizing a fixed-exchange relationship.  
- CFP franc (Colonies Françaises du Pacifique): A separate currency for French Pacific possessions that performed an analogous role to the CFA in maintaining monetary ties with France.  
- French Indochinese piastre: Indochina retained its own pegged currency, the piastre, reflecting differentiated colonial monetary treatment where local economic conditions and pre-existing monetary systems mattered.  
- Caribbean possessions: Several Caribbean territories continued to use the metropolitan French franc rather than being placed on a separate colonial currency, showing variation in Paris’s approach across its empire.

3. Institutional mechanics in West Africa: from BAO to BCEAO (legal and administrative continuity)  
- Initial issuer: In West Africa the CFA franc was originally issued by the Banque de l'Afrique Occidentale (BAO), a regional institution that operated under French legal authority.  
- Issuance privilege: The BAO’s right to issue the CFA derived from a specific issuance privilege granted by French legislation — an explicit legal mechanism by which metropolitan sovereignty translated into monetary control abroad.  
- 1955 transition: In 1955 the BAO’s issuance role was transferred to a public-sector body, the Institut d'Émission de l'Afrique Occidentale Française et du Togo, signaling a move toward institutions nominally more local or public but still embedded in French legal and policy frameworks.  
- 1959 institutionalization: That Institut was renamed the Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) in 1959. The renaming and reorganization mark an institutional continuity from colonial-era arrangements into the structures that would become central banks for West African states.

4. Legal authority, parity, and metropolitan oversight  
- Fixed parity: The CFA’s design centered on a fixed or managed parity with the French franc, ensuring exchanges with metropolitan currency at conditions favorable to Paris’s economic and strategic objectives.  
- French oversight: The issuance privilege and related legal instruments meant that local monetary operations were carried out under French legislative and administrative oversight, constraining the monetary autonomy of colonial territories even as some local institutions were created or reformed.

5. Long-term consequences and strategic dimensions  
- Enduring monetary linkages: These administered currency arrangements did not vanish with political independence. The institutional framework — exemplified by the BCEAO’s evolution — provided continuity in monetary governance that often preserved strong financial ties to France.  
- Implications for sovereignty and policy space: Fixed parities and legalized issuance privileges limited exchange-rate flexibility and constrained independent monetary policy, affecting fiscal options, trade responses, and crisis management for successor states.  
- Strategic influence: Monetary arrangements became instruments of continued metropolitan influence, shaping economic dependency, investment flows, and the policy choices available to newly independent governments.

6. Relevance to India’s strategic culture and post-colonial monetary choices (comparative lesson)  
- For a study of India’s strategic culture and national-security policy, the French case is instructive as a counterpoint. India’s post-independence monetary path — characterized by a centrally sovereign Reserve Bank of India, independently managed currency policy, and a strong emphasis on monetary autonomy — reflects a strategic preference for institutional control over monetary instruments as part of wider autonomy in economic and security affairs.  
- The French colonial model highlights how currency architecture can be an enduring vector of foreign influence; it thereby underscores why monetary sovereignty is often treated in strategic terms by states emerging from colonial rule. Policymakers concerned with national security and strategic autonomy must therefore consider the institutional design of currency regimes and the legacy of external monetary linkages.

Conclusion  
The post‑1945 French construction of colonial currencies and the institutional trajectory from BAO to BCEAO in West Africa exemplify how metropolitan monetary decisions can be translated into long-lasting administrative and legal structures abroad. These arrangements demonstrate the intersection of monetary policy, institutional design, and strategic power projection — a nexus of particular interest for scholars of strategic culture because control over currency is not merely economic technique but a persistent instrument of influence with consequences for sovereignty and security.

## The West African Monetary Union: institutional design, external guarantees, and lessons for strategic autonomy

Background and institutional architecture
- The West African Monetary Union was established in 1962 by treaty between France and a group of newly independent West African states. The treaty created an operational framework centred on an operations account (French: compte d'opérations) maintained at the French Treasury. Member states pooled their external reserves into that account and accepted its dual function: a reserve-pooling mechanism and an overdraft facility that could be tapped for short-term liquidity.
- The common currency circulating in the union was the CFA franc (Communauté Financière Africaine franc), managed by the Banque Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO). The BCEAO served as the central bank for the union’s member states, administering currency issuance and basic monetary operations under the terms agreed with France.
- A key legal-financial guarantee underpinning the arrangement was France’s assurance of unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into the French franc. This guarantee was anchored in a fixed exchange rate set at 50 CFA francs = 1 French franc. That parity reflected an earlier French monetary history (a 1948 devaluation and the 1960 redenomination of the French franc—100 old francs = 1 new franc), but it was formalised in the post‑colonial treaty framework.

Functional consequences: stability, dependency and moral hazard
- The institutional design delivered an immediate policy advantage: by pooling reserves and anchoring the CFA to the French franc with a convertibility guarantee, the arrangement offered strong external confidence and exchange-rate stability. For fragile newly independent states, that stability reduced currency risk, facilitated trade and attracted some forms of external finance.
- At the same time, the trade-offs were stark. Member states ceded significant autonomy over monetary policy. The requirement to pool reserves and the guarantee from France constrained independent exchange-rate and liquidity management choices. In practice, national fiscal and monetary actions had to be calibrated to preserve convertibility and the stability of the peg.
- The overdraft facility improved short-term liquidity management but carried moral‑hazard risks. With a backstop in place, governments could be less disciplined on fiscal policy, expecting that liquidity shortfalls could be mitigated via the operations account. Over time this dynamic complicated the alignment of monetary stability and fiscal responsibility.

Institutional evolution: 1973 reforms and BCEAO relocation
- In 1973 a substantive reform of the monetary framework occurred through a treaty revision and a new monetary cooperation agreement. One prominent reform stipulation was the relocation of the BCEAO’s headquarters from Paris to Dakar. The physical transfer, completed in mid‑1978, culminated in the inauguration of the new building in May 1979.
- The relocation had symbolic and practical significance. Moving the central bank to West Africa represented a step toward regional institutional autonomy and ownership, even while the formal currency link and convertibility guarantee with France persisted. It illustrated how institutional geography can matter for political legitimacy and the perception of sovereignty.

Membership and subsequent developments
- Typical founding members were former French colonies in West Africa—Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Benin, Mauritania, among others—states that accepted the CFA franc arrangement in the early post‑independence era.
- Over the decades the union evolved. Notable later developments (outside the immediate treaty history above) included the dramatic 1994 devaluation of the CFA franc and recurring debates about reforming the currency arrangement and reducing the institutional linkages with France. Those episodes underscore the long-term tensions between stability and sovereignty.

Analytical implications for strategic culture and national security policy (lessons for comparative reflection)
Although this case arises from a West African–French post‑colonial context, it offers durable lessons relevant to countries—like India—that integrate strategic culture with national security policy:

1. External guarantees buy stability but can constrain strategic autonomy
   - An external convertibility guarantee (here, France’s unlimited convertibility) can create immediate macroeconomic stability, useful in turbulent contexts. Yet such guarantees create dependencies that limit sovereign choice—particularly in crises where monetary policy could be a tool of national strategy. States must weigh short‑term stability gains against long‑term autonomy costs.

2. Institutional design shapes the state’s policy space
   - Rules that govern reserve pooling, overdrafts, and parity commitments materially restrict independent monetary action. For national security planners, the lesson is that economic and financial institutional choices are strategic decisions: they determine the tools available during sanctions, war, or economic coercion.

3. Backstops create moral‑hazard trade‑offs
   - Liquidity backstops improve resilience but may incentivise lax fiscal behaviour. Sustainable security requires institutions that couple support mechanisms with governance safeguards to avoid undermining resilience through weakened fiscal discipline.

4. Symbolic and territorial elements of institutions matter
   - The BCEAO’s relocation from Paris to Dakar was more than logistical: it signalled a shift in ownership and legitimacy. For strategic culture, the location, composition, and perceived control of key institutions affect domestic legitimacy and international signalling—important when crafting commitments that bear on national security.

5. Path dependency and reform difficulties
   - Fixed linkages and parities create strong path dependencies. Reforms (e.g., the 1994 devaluation and later debates) are politically and economically costly. Strategic planners should account for the inertia in monetary arrangements when assessing future options.

Concluding comparative note
The West African Monetary Union demonstrates the perennial policy trade-off between external anchoring (stability) and sovereign control (autonomy). For states that view economic instruments as integral to national security, the case illustrates why monetary architecture must be evaluated not only for macroeconomic credentials but for its strategic implications—whether in crisis resilience, diplomatic independence, or the signalling of sovereignty. When designing institutions, policymakers should deliberately balance immediate economic benefits against the longer-term imperatives of strategic autonomy and security policy.

### Case study: UEMOA — origins, monetary mechanics, and strategic implications

Background and founding
- The Union Économique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine (UEMOA — West African Economic and Monetary Union) was established by treaty signed in Dakar, Senegal on 10 January 1994. The original founding signatories were the heads of state or government of Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. These states created a compact combining a common currency area, common rules for fiscal and macroeconomic convergence, and supranational institutions to manage monetary policy and banking supervision.
- On 2 May 1997 Guinea‑Bissau acceded as the eighth member. Notably, Guinea‑Bissau — a former Portuguese colony — is the only non‑francophone country in the union; upon joining it adopted the West African CFA franc (XOF), thereby aligning its monetary framework with the francophone members.

Monetary arrangements with France: legacy mechanics and recent revision
- UEMOA’s monetary arrangements grew out of a long-standing relationship with France and, by extension, the euro area. A central feature of that legacy architecture had been an “operations account” mechanism that functioned as part of the practical linkage between UEMOA member central banking operations and the French treasury/euro system.
- On 29 December 2019 the monetary cooperation agreement between UEMOA and France was revised. The principal operational consequence of that revision was the termination of the operations account mechanism in January 2020. This termination represented an important change in operational mechanics — effectively removing a particular channel through which liquidity management and settlement had been managed vis‑à‑vis France.
- Crucially, however, the revision did not eliminate the fundamental convertibility assurance: France retained an unlimited guarantee of convertibility of the CFA franc into euros. In other words, the formal fiscal/convertibility backstop remained, even as the operational plumbing of how that backstop interfaced with UEMOA’s own financial operations was altered.

Reserve management and international accounts
- UEMOA maintains an array of international operating accounts as part of its reserve management and payments architecture. At present the union operates 32 international accounts spread across ten countries and denominated in eight currencies. One of these accounts is held at the United States Federal Reserve.
- The geographic and currency spread of these accounts underlines two points: first, the practical necessity for a monetary union to hold foreign assets and transactional balances in multiple currencies to facilitate trade, remit foreign reserves, and manage cross‑border liquidity; second, the degree to which a supposedly regional currency regime remains embedded in a global system of central banks and reserve currencies.

Relation to ECOWAS and regional context
- UEMOA is institutionally and functionally distinct from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). UEMOA is a smaller, deeper monetary union centered on a single currency (the XOF) and more rigorous macroeconomic convergence rules. ECOWAS, by contrast, is a broader regional bloc encompassing fifteen West African states with a wider political and economic remit; ECOWAS has long articulated ambitions for a regional currency (the ECO) but that project has proceeded separately and unevenly relative to UEMOA’s operations.
- Guinea‑Bissau’s adoption of XOF on accession highlights how membership in a monetary union can be an act of institutional alignment that goes beyond language or colonial heritage, even as the presence of a non‑francophone member underscores the enduring imprint of post‑colonial economic structures.

Interpretation: decolonising mechanics without ending guarantees
- The 2019–2020 changes in UEMOA’s arrangements with France should be read as part of a broader trend in African regionalism: rebalancing inherited post‑colonial monetary linkages to increase operational autonomy while retaining certain stabilising ties to global currencies and partners. Terminating the operations account altered how the union transacted and managed liquidity, but the continuation of the unlimited convertibility guarantee meant that sovereignty over currency issuance and convertibility remained constrained by continued external assurance.
- The multi‑currency account structure — including an account at the US Federal Reserve — illustrates the pragmatic balancing act: regional monetary sovereignty and integration require acceptance of, and operational engagement with, international financial infrastructure.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For readers concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, UEMOA offers several transferable lessons:
  1. Regional integration yields economic and political benefits but can entail durable external dependencies. States pursuing strategic autonomy must therefore weigh deep integration (e.g., common currency) against potential constraints posed by external guarantees and global reserve architectures.
  2. Changes in operational mechanics (terminating an operations account) can increase perceived sovereignty without immediately severing practical dependencies. This suggests a calibrated approach to reform — important for India as it engages with partners and regional institutions (in Africa and beyond) where symbolic decolonising steps must be balanced against the need for stability.
  3. Holding diversified international accounts — including at major central banks — is a pragmatic stability tool. For India’s external economic policy and its security‑economic interface, the management of foreign reserves and payment corridors is part of strategic resilience.
  4. Distinguishing among different levels of regionalism (a narrow monetary union like UEMOA versus a broader political‑economic bloc like ECOWAS) is critical: India’s engagement must be tailored to institutional depth and objectives of each grouping it interacts with, particularly in Africa where several overlapping architectures coexist.
- In sum, UEMOA exemplifies how regional monetary unions negotiate the trade‑off between integration and external linkage. For policymakers and scholars of India’s strategic posture, the case underlines the importance of careful institutional design, an awareness of legacy dependencies, and the tactical use of operational reforms to advance both autonomy and stability.

### 7.4 Case Study: Political Confederations versus Monetary Unions — The Alliance of Sahel States and UEMOA

This brief case examines the recent formation of the Alliance of Sahel States alongside the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) to draw analytic lessons about the distinction between political‑military alignments and monetary integration. Although geographically remote from South Asia, this West African example offers concrete insights for Indian strategic culture: alliances can be formed rapidly on security grounds, but disentangling (or reconfiguring) monetary and economic commitments is technically, legally and politically costly — a fact that shapes both sovereign choices and the leverage of external actors.

- The Alliance of Sahel States and its limits
  - Three Sahelian states — commonly identified as Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — have declared a confederation commonly referred to as the Alliance of Sahel States. This grouping is primarily political and security‑oriented.
  - Crucially, the confederation does not create a shared monetary area or introduce a common currency. Membership in a political/military confederation therefore does not automatically imply, or require, a change in monetary arrangements.

- UEMOA and the CFA franc: embedded monetary integration
  - By contrast, UEMOA is a formal monetary union whose member states share a single currency, the CFA franc. The union is underpinned by institutional commitments, including rules of fiscal and regulatory convergence.
  - The CFA franc’s perceived stability has long relied on a convertibility guarantee associated with the French Treasury (as described in the source text). That external backing is not merely technical; it is an institutional lever with political consequences.

- Why “joining one grouping” is not the same as “leaving another”
  - The three Sahelian states that joined the Alliance have not signalled an intention to exit UEMOA. The decision to depart a monetary union is fundamentally different from the decision to enter a political confederation: it implicates central bank operations, foreign reserves, redenomination of contracts, and formal legal procedures.
  - According to the institutional arrangement outlined in the source, a member state that seeks to withdraw would have to reclaim its share of the union’s foreign exchange reserves — reserves reported as split roughly 50/50 between the UEMOA central bank (resident in Abidjan) and the French Treasury. Recovering those assets would entail complex negotiation, potential legal claims, and the risk of political confrontation with both regional institutions and France.

- Economic and technical consequences of exit
  - Short‑term macroeconomic risks: an exit can trigger exchange‑rate adjustment, capital flight, and inflationary pressures as the economy re‑prices goods, services and contracts denominated in the shared currency.
  - Operational challenges: a departing state must either create a new national currency (and the hardware of monetary operations) or adopt another external currency; both paths demand substantial foreign‑exchange buffers, rapid central bank capacity building, and practical arrangements for redenominating contracts, bank accounts and public debt.
  - Regulatory and fiscal unwinding: UEMOA membership entails fiscal convergence criteria and harmonized regulations. A departure requires unwinding or renegotiating those obligations, settling cross‑border claims, and re‑establishing national clearing and payment systems.

- Strategic and geopolitical implications
  - External leverage: because the French Treasury’s role underwrites convertibility, France retains leverage in any exit negotiation — a leverage that can translate into political constraints on member states’ autonomy.
  - Regional spillovers: an exit by one member risks disrupting intra‑regional trade, investor confidence and neighbouring states’ stability, with potential knock‑on effects for regional security and political alignments.
  - Political symbolism versus economic reality: forming a security confederation can signal a shift in foreign policy orientation, but durable economic realignment requires overcoming technical, financial and diplomatic hurdles.

- Lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
  - Distinguish political allegiance from economic entanglement: security partnerships can be formed quickly; economic and monetary commitments bind states more deeply and require long‑term institutional capacity to alter or reverse.
  - Anticipate non‑military levers of influence: external actors who underwrite financial stability (through guarantees, reserve arrangements, or payment‑system linkages) retain durable leverage in political disputes. Strategic planners must factor financial architecture into assessments of sovereignty and dependence.
  - Build institutional capacity before committing: effective independent monetary policy demands robust central bank institutions, reserve buffers, legal frameworks for redenomination, and contingency planning for trade and financial stability.
  - Manage exit costs and design contingencies: any foreign‑policy shift that might imply economic reorientation should be accompanied by detailed legal, fiscal and operational plans to manage reserve claims, contract redenomination and regulatory divergence.
  - Consider regional ripple effects: national decisions about monetary membership affect neighbours and can reshape regional integration trajectories; thus, strategic choices must account for regional economic interdependence and stability.

Concluding remark
- The Sahel/UEMOA example demonstrates a basic yet enduring principle for statecraft: political solidarity can be declarative and rapid, but monetary and economic integration embeds durable, technical constraints that are not easily disentangled. For Indian strategic planners — engaged in partnerships and investments across Africa and beyond — recognizing the asymmetric costs of political versus economic reorientation is essential to realistic, resilient policy design.

## Case Study: UEMOA — Objectives, Achievements and Limits of a West African Customs‑and‑Currency Union

Overview  
The West African Economic and Monetary Union (Union économique et monétaire ouest‑africaine — UEMOA) brings together eight francophone states (Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea‑Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo) in a dual project: a customs union and a currency union anchored by the West African CFA franc (XOF) and a common central bank, the Banque Centrale des États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest (BCEAO). Formally conceived to deepen regional integration, UEMOA combines legal and regulatory harmonisation, a common external tariff (CET), and macroeconomic surveillance through convergence criteria. Its evolution offers a compact, instructive example of the strengths and limits of economically‑focused regionalism — with direct bearing on strategic thinking about stability, resilience and policy coordination in geographically proximate states.

Objectives and institutional instruments
- Dual character: UEMOA is simultaneously a customs union (trade policy coordination and CET) and a monetary union (common currency, common central bank).
- Stated objectives:
  - Raise regional economic competitiveness through market opening, simplification of trade rules and harmonised commercial legislation.
  - Converge macroeconomic policies and performance via binding convergence criteria and a surveillance framework (limits on fiscal deficits, public debt, inflation and budgetary arrears).
  - Build a common market facilitating the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital (implicitly and progressively).
  - Coordinate sectoral policies — industry, agriculture, transport, services — to foster complementary national development strategies.
  - Harmonise fiscal instruments, notably the regional alignment of indirect taxation regimes.
- Institutional tools:
  - BCEAO as monetary anchor and issuer of the XOF, with implied external peg arrangements that shape member states’ macroeconomic space.
  - A regional legal framework for customs and taxation, and monitoring mechanisms for compliance with convergence criteria.
  - Regional programmes for structural reforms and sectoral investments intended to reduce non‑tariff obstacles and improve connectivity.

Reported achievements
- Macroeconomic convergence architecture: UEMOA has established convergence criteria and a surveillance mechanism that are among the more institutionalised on the continent; these promote fiscal discipline and policy transparency.
- Customs union implementation: Adoption of a common external tariff has simplified the external trade regime in principle and created a uniform framework for import duties.
- Tax harmonisation: The region has harmonised several aspects of indirect taxation, reducing legal fragmentation that impedes intraregional trade.
- Structural and sectoral policy initiatives: UEMOA has initiated regional programmes to support infrastructure, market integration and sector development.
- External recognition: An IMF review (September 2002) described UEMOA as, at that time, among the most advanced African regional groupings in terms of integration architecture.

Persistent challenges and empirical limits
- Low depth of economic integration: Despite institutional apparatus, the effective level of cross‑border economic integration remains low. Trade flows, investment links and factor mobility have not converged to the degree envisaged.
- Increasing income disparities: Aggregate measures show that income divergence has persisted and even widened since the union’s creation. In 2022, GDP per capita ranged from US$1,950 in Côte d’Ivoire (highest) to US$484 in Niger (lowest), underlining striking asymmetries.
- Export concentration and vulnerability: In 2022, Côte d’Ivoire and Senegal accounted for more than 60% of UEMOA’s exports, indicating a concentrated export base that increases the union’s exposure to sectoral shocks affecting dominant economies and commodities.
- Divergent growth performance: During the 2010s, member growth rates diverged — Côte d’Ivoire recorded the highest average annual growth (~6.72%), while Guinea‑Bissau recorded the lowest (~3.85%). That said, some reduction in dispersion is observable: the mean dispersion of growth across members fell from 1.26 in the pre‑UEMOA period to 0.73 thereafter, suggesting modest convergence in volatility if not in levels.
- Enforcement and asymmetric capacity: The benefits of a common external tariff and harmonised rules presuppose consistent enforcement and comparable administrative capacity; weaker states often struggle to extract full gains without compensatory transfers or investment.
- Outdated assessments and need for continuous monitoring: The IMF’s 2002 appraisal remains a landmark endorsement but is dated; recent progress varies across domains and requires ongoing, high‑frequency evaluation.

Contextual details critical to interpretation
- Membership and monetary arrangement: The eight members use the XOF, issued by the BCEAO, which is part of the monetary union’s stabilising architecture. The currency arrangement constrains national monetary policy autonomy but provides price stability benefits and transactional certainty.
- Convergence criteria content: Typical criteria (observed in practice) limit fiscal deficits, public debt ratios, inflation ceilings and arrears; these rules seek macroeconomic stability but can be procyclical if not complemented by counter‑cyclical fiscal capacities.
- Overlap with ECOWAS: UEMOA’s territory overlaps with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Coordination (or its absence) between overlapping regional institutions can produce policy fragmentation or duplication unless political and technical harmonisation is actively pursued.

Policy implications and relevance to strategic thought
For students of strategic culture and national security policy — including analysts focusing on India’s region — UEMOA is illuminating in several respects:
- Economic integration as a stability instrument: Regional economic frameworks can enhance predictability and interdependence, contributing to political stability. But the mere presence of institutions (customs union, currency union) does not guarantee resilience unless distributional asymmetries are addressed.
- Asymmetry and security risk: Large disparities in income and export concentration concentrate risks geographically and economically, potentially creating sources of instability that have security externalities (migration pressures, conflict risks, illicit trade).
- Limits of harmonisation alone: Legal and regulatory harmonisation is necessary but insufficient. Deeper integration requires investments in connectivity (transport, digital), targeted transfers or development funds, and capacity building for weaker members to ensure equitable gains.
- Monetary union trade‑offs: The XOF/BCEAO arrangement demonstrates the stabilising advantages of a shared currency but also highlights constraints on national macro policy — a trade‑off with security implications in crisis response capability.
- Coordination across institutions: UEMOA’s overlap with ECOWAS mirrors challenges elsewhere (e.g., South Asian institutions). Avoiding policy fragmentation demands clear division of labour and coordination mechanisms — an instructive lesson for India’s regional policy engagements (SAARC, BIMSTEC, and bilateral initiatives).
- Policy prescriptions for deeper, resilient integration:
  - Strengthen enforcement mechanisms for CET and cross‑border rules while providing technical assistance to administrations with weaker capacity.
  - Design targeted fiscal transfers or regional development funds to reduce structural disparities and to finance public goods (transport corridors, power interconnectors).
  - Prioritise export diversification and value‑chain development in lagging economies to reduce vulnerability to commodity shocks.
  - Maintain continuous, transparent monitoring and external evaluation to update policy priorities in line with evolving economic realities.

Concluding observation
UEMOA represents an advanced, legally codified attempt to combine customs and monetary union in a low‑income regional setting. Its experience underscores the analytic point that institutional architecture is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for equitable, deep integration. For national security strategists and policymakers — whether in West Africa, South Asia or elsewhere — the union’s outcomes stress the necessity of pairing rules and convergence criteria with investment, redistribution mechanisms and sustained institutional capacity building if regional economic arrangements are to deliver durable stability and strategic resilience.

### ECOWAS–UEMOA Coordination on Trade Liberalisation and Macroeconomic Convergence:
A concise case and its relevance to Indian strategic thinking

This section examines a concrete episode of regional institutional coordination in West Africa — notably the common plan of action on trade liberalisation agreed between ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) and UEMOA (Union Économique et Monétaire Ouest Africaine) — and draws out the institutional design, implementation requirements, risks and measurable outcomes. Though geographically distant, this case furnishes useful comparative lessons for India’s strategic culture and national-security thinking about economic integration, sovereignty, and the political economy of reform.

1. The plan of action: trade liberalisation aligned with macroeconomic convergence
- Core elements: ECOWAS and UEMOA developed a joint plan to liberalise intra‑regional trade (tariff reductions, mitigation of non‑tariff barriers) while synchronising macroeconomic policies among member states.
- Rationale: Trade liberalisation aims to increase intra‑regional commerce and economic interdependence; macroeconomic convergence (harmonised inflation targets, fiscal deficit ceilings, public‑debt limits and exchange‑rate practices) is intended to stabilise the macro environment so liberalisation does not create asymmetric shocks.
- Institutional implication: Linking trade policy to macroeconomic convergence converts a market‑opening agenda into a broader governance project requiring cross‑sectoral coordination (finance ministries, central banks, customs administrations).

2. Rules of origin: protecting regional gains and preventing leakage
- Purpose: Common rules of origin determine which goods qualify for preferential treatment, preventing re‑export or third‑country transshipment that would siphon benefits away from regional producers.
- Design considerations: Rules must balance strictness (to prevent abuse) with practicability (so they do not become non‑tariff barriers). Verification and documentation standards are central.
- Relevance for India: In areas where India contemplates preferential arrangements (e.g., BIMSTEC or neighbourhood initiatives), carefully calibrated rules of origin are crucial to ensure intended domestic industries benefit and to limit regulatory arbitrage.

3. Customs harmonisation: adopting common declaration forms
- Measure taken: ECOWAS agreed to adopt UEMOA’s customs declaration forms to harmonise documentation and procedural requirements across the region.
- Benefits: Common forms improve interoperability, shorten clearance times, reduce compliance costs and lower opportunities for discretionary behaviour at points of entry. They facilitate training and the construction of interoperable IT backbones.
- Caveat: The utility of harmonised forms depends on uniform administrative capacity and compatible information‑technology systems.

4. Compensation mechanisms: managing fiscal effects of liberalisation
- Function: Compensation procedures are designed to offset short‑term revenue losses for states—especially from tariff reduction—and to smooth the transition for budgetary planners.
- Typical features: Temporary transfers, phased tariff adjustments, targeted support for vulnerable revenue‑dependent administrations, and mechanisms to finance convergence costs (often with development‑partner support).
- Security implication: Unexpected fiscal stress from integration can undermine state capacity; thus compensation mechanisms are not merely economic niceties but political‑stability tools.

5. Implementation requirements and principal actors
- Legal and regulatory harmonisation: Treaties, model laws and national implementing legislation are required to make agreed measures effective.
- Capacity building: Training of customs officials, judiciary familiarisation with rules of origin and administrative procedures.
- IT and interoperability: Compatible customs management systems, shared databases and electronic single windows speed up compliance and enforcement.
- Key actors to monitor: ECOWAS Commission and UEMOA Commission (policy coordination and technical design), national customs administrations (implementation), finance ministries and central banks (macroeconomic monitoring), the private sector (compliance and feedback), and development partners (technical and financial assistance).

6. Risks and political‑economy constraints
- Fiscal risk: Short‑term revenue losses from tariff liberalisation can be significant for revenue‑constrained states.
- Uneven capacity: Disparities among member states in administrative competence and fiscal buffers can create asymmetric benefits and political friction.
- Political resistance: Domestic constituencies (producers, regional elites, revenue ministries) may resist perceived losses of sovereignty or income.
- Operational risk: Lack of IT compatibility or insufficient training can nullify the theoretical gains of harmonisation.

7. Measurable success indicators
- Trade outcomes: Growth in intra‑regional trade volumes and share of regional trade relative to total trade.
- Administrative performance: Reduced customs clearance times, fewer documentary discrepancies, and lower costs of compliance.
- Compliance and integrity: Measured adherence to rules of origin and a decline in fraud/transshipment cases.
- Macroeconomic convergence: Alignment of inflation rates, fiscal deficits, debt‑to‑GDP ratios and reserve policies within agreed bands.
- Political metrics: Degree of political buy‑in reflected in national legislation adoption and sustained budgetary commitments to compensation mechanisms.

8. Comparative lessons for India’s strategic culture and national‑security policy
- Integration is a state‑capacity project as much as an economic one: India’s strategic planners should see regional economic initiatives through a governance and state‑capacity prism — fiscal stability, customs competence and legal harmonisation are prerequisites for durable integration.
- Manage the political economy up front: Compensation schemes and phased implementation can reduce backlash from revenue losses and political constituencies; neglecting these can convert an economic reform into a security challenge (e.g., destabilised local economies or loss of state legitimacy).
- Technical harmonisation matters: Common forms, interoperable IT systems and shared verification standards yield outsized gains in trade facilitation; India’s neighbourhood initiatives should prioritise these technical building blocks.
- Rules of origin as strategic instruments: Carefully designed and enforceable origin rules protect intended beneficiaries and prevent exploitation by third parties; their complexity must be calibrated to administrative capacity.
- Monitor asymmetries: Where member states differ in capacity or exposure, institutional arrangements must include asymmetric, compensatory measures and development‑partner involvement to prevent fragmentation.
- Readiness over ambition: Ambitious integration goals without the institutional groundwork invite failure. India’s strategic culture — which prizes calibrated, capability‑based approaches — aligns with this lesson: incremental, well‑sequenced harmonisation backed by clear metrics is likelier to secure both economic and security dividends.

Conclusion
The ECOWAS–UEMOA coordination example underscores that regional trade liberalisation is inseparable from macroeconomic governance, administrative harmonisation and political management. For Indian policymakers, the key takeaway is that economic integration initiatives should be designed as multi‑dimensional state projects — combining technical harmonisation, legal reform, fiscal safeguards and political accommodation — to protect national security interests while pursuing regional economic benefits.

### West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU / UEMOA): Membership, Purpose and Strategic Implications

Background and membership
- The West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU, in French UEMOA) was created by treaty in 1994 to promote deeper economic and monetary integration among a sub‑group of West African states. Its membership currently comprises eight countries:
  - Benin — Founding Member
  - Burkina Faso — Founding Member
  - Guinea‑Bissau — acceded 2 May 1997 (not a founding member)
  - Côte d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast) — Founding Member
  - Mali — Founding Member
  - Niger — Founding Member
  - Senegal — Founding Member
  - Togo — Founding Member

Institutional architecture and policy instruments
- Currency and central bank: WAEMU members share the West African CFA franc (XOF). The common currency is managed by the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which conducts monetary policy for the union and anchors exchange‑rate stability among its members.
- Core economic policy objectives: the union was designed to produce a high degree of policy harmonization and market integration. Key instruments and goals include:
  - A customs union and a common external tariff to coordinate trade policy.
  - Macroeconomic convergence criteria (fiscal and inflation targets) intended to stabilise public finances and support monetary stability.
  - Coordinated sectoral policies (banking regulation, competition policy, infrastructure and services) to facilitate intra‑union trade and private investment.

Political and historical character
- Post‑colonial composition: seven of the eight members are francophone and were former French colonies; Guinea‑Bissau is the sole Lusophone member. This linguistic and colonial pattern shapes institutional culture, legal frameworks and external diplomatic linkages.
- Overlap with broader regional structures: most WAEMU members are also members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). This creates overlapping jurisdictions — WAEMU for deeper monetary and economic integration among a subset, ECOWAS for wider political and economic cooperation — with practical consequences for policy coordination and external relations.

Guinea‑Bissau’s accession in context
- Guinea‑Bissau joined in 1997, three years after the treaty’s signing. Its accession is significant for two reasons:
  - Geographic integration: it consolidated coastal West African states within the currency union, smoothing trade and payments across the Gulf of Guinea littoral.
  - Linguistic and political widening: the inclusion of a Lusophone state subtly broadened the union’s post‑colonial character and required accommodation of different legal and administrative traditions.

Practical implications of WAEMU membership
- Economic benefits and constraints:
  - Currency stability and reduced exchange‑rate risk within the union facilitate intra‑WAEMU trade and investment.
  - A common external tariff and customs union simplify cross‑border commerce but constrain individual members’ unilateral trade policy — e.g., negotiating bilateral trade concessions requires coordination with the union.
  - Fiscal and macroeconomic convergence rules can discipline deficits and inflation but also limit countercyclical fiscal space for member states facing asymmetric shocks.
- Institutional coordination:
  - Shared banking regulation and BCEAO oversight aim to preserve financial stability, but enforcement and capacity vary across members.
  - Overlap with ECOWAS requires diplomatic balancing: states and external partners often engage both bodies, each with different mandates and memberships.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- When engaging West Africa, understanding WAEMU’s structure and dynamics is analytically important for Indian policy-makers for several reasons:
  - Economic statecraft: a single currency zone and common external tariff change the nature of trade and investment opportunities. Indian exporters and investors face a bloc‑level market architecture rather than purely bilateral national regimes; negotiations and commercial diplomacy may therefore be more effective when directed at WAEMU institutions as well as national governments.
  - Financial and monetary considerations: currency stability under the CFA franc and BCEAO governance reduces currency risk within the union, making parts of WAEMU more predictable destinations for Indian capital, concessional finance and banking partnerships. Conversely, the peg arrangements and macroeconomic rules constrain the policy levers available to national partners, influencing how India designs development assistance or economic cooperation packages.
  - Diplomatic access and languages: the francophone predominance means French remains the lingua franca for diplomacy and many bureaucratic channels; Guinea‑Bissau’s Lusophone status is a reminder of linguistic heterogeneity and potential openings for India’s outreach, especially through contacts with Lusophone networks (e.g., CPLP states) and India’s existing ties with Portuguese‑speaking Africa.
  - Security and regional governance: overlapping memberships (WAEMU and ECOWAS) require India to calibrate its security cooperation — peacekeeping, maritime security, counter‑terrorism support — to both sub‑regional and regional institutions. WAEMU’s economic integration can reinforce or complicate ECOWAS’s political responses to crises, with downstream effects on India’s evacuation planning, citizen protection and military‑to‑military engagement.
  - Strategic opportunities and limits: WAEMU’s institutional permanence and economic rules provide predictable interlocutors for long‑term projects (infrastructure, banking, capacity building). At the same time, the union’s policy constraints and intra‑regional disparities mean India must combine union‑level engagement with tailored bilateral initiatives to be effective.

Concluding observation
- WAEMU is a compact, institutionally dense sub‑regional bloc whose currency union, regulatory frameworks and historical legacies shape economic behaviour and regional governance in francophone West Africa. For Indian strategic planners, appreciation of WAEMU’s membership composition (including Guinea‑Bissau’s later accession), policy instruments and overlaps with ECOWAS is essential for designing coherent economic, diplomatic and security engagement in the region.
