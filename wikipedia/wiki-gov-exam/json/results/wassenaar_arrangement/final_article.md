# 1996 multilateral export control regime

## Participating states of the Wassenaar Arrangement

Full name: Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies (commonly: the Wassenaar Arrangement).

The Wassenaar Arrangement is a multilateral, non-treaty export control regime that governs international transfers of conventional arms and a broad range of dual-use goods and technologies. It was founded on 12 July 1996 in Wassenaar, Netherlands, as a post–Cold War successor to the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom). Where CoCom had functioned as a rigid embargo mechanism focused on denying advanced goods to the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War, Wassenaar was designed to adapt to a different strategic environment by emphasizing transparency, responsibility and coordination among participating states.

Stated objective and operational intent
- The Arrangement’s stated objective is to “contribute to regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility” among its participants. Practically, this translates into coordinated national export-control policies intended to prevent transfers or diversion of sensitive technologies to states or actors whose acquisition would undermine those security goals.
- Rather than creating a single legally binding regime, Wassenaar coordinates policy through lists, information exchange and peer-level consultation. Members are expected to align their national controls with the Arrangement’s control lists and practices, and to exercise restraint in exports that might destabilize regions or contribute to the development of threatening military capabilities.

Origins and membership
- Established 12 July 1996 in Wassenaar, the Arrangement replaced CoCom and sought to adapt export control practice to the diffusion of technology after the Cold War.
- The participating states number in the forties (42 is commonly cited); membership includes a wide range of advanced industrial democracies and some countries that were formerly part of Comecon/Warsaw Pact structures (for example, Russia has been included among participants at various points).
- Membership is important politically and practically: membership signals adherence to shared norms of responsible transfer and gives access to the Arrangement’s information-exchange mechanisms and technical work.

Administration, decision-making and legal character
- A small permanent secretariat in Vienna, Austria, supports the Arrangement by servicing plenary meetings, working groups and the exchange of transfer data and denials.
- The Wassenaar Arrangement is not a treaty and hence not legally binding on participants. Decisions and policy coordination rest on voluntary compliance, national export-control systems and the influence of political will and peer pressure. There is no institutional veto by individual members; instead, activities rely on inter-governmental coordination and consensus-building.
- Because the Arrangement is non-binding, its effectiveness depends on the domestic implementation of controls by individual members and on political willingness to harmonize regulatory practice.

Information exchange and control coverage
- One of the Arrangement’s principal mechanisms is voluntary, regular exchange of information. Every six months participants exchange data on deliveries of conventional arms to non‑Wassenaar states. This information exchange is intended to increase transparency about major conventional arms transfers and help participants detect patterns of proliferation or diversion.
- The information exchange on conventional arms is structured around eight broad weapons categories: battle tanks; armoured fighting vehicles; large‑calibre artillery systems; military aircraft; military helicopters; warships; missiles and missile systems; small arms and light weapons.
- Beyond conventional arms, the Arrangement maintains two principal lists that members use to shape national control regimes: the Munitions List (covering conventional military equipment) and the Dual-Use List (covering technologies and equipment with civilian applications but potential military uses). Members update these lists through the Arrangement’s working groups to reflect technological change.

Technical and administrative complexities
- Dual-use controls are intrinsically complex because many advanced components and systems (advanced electronics, sensors, software, machine tools, telecommunications equipment) have both civilian and military applications. Distinguishing legitimate civilian trade from transfers that might materially enhance an adversary’s military capabilities requires technical expertise, case-by-case assessment, and carefully calibrated national licensing practices.
- The secretariat supports technical work—preparing plenary agendas, facilitating working-group exchange, and maintaining records of transfers and denial notifications. But because the Arrangement is founded on voluntary cooperation, much of the detailed regulatory work occurs within national agencies and through intergovernmental dialogue.

Relationship with other regimes and limits to effectiveness
- The Wassenaar Arrangement complements other export control regimes — for example the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Australia Group — by focusing specifically on conventional arms and a broad set of dual-use technologies.
- Changes to control lists and practices are typically incremental and consensus-driven. Political shifts, divergent national interests, or changing threat perceptions among members can slow adaptation or create asymmetries in enforcement.
- The Arrangement’s non‑binding nature means compliance relies on national law, political will, reputational concerns and reciprocal pressures. This makes the regime adaptable but also vulnerable to uneven implementation and to strategic exploitation by actors determined to evade controls.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Although India is not a Wassenaar participant, the Arrangement matters to Indian strategic planning in several ways:
  - Technology access and defence modernization: The Arrangement’s control lists and the export policies of participating states influence India’s access to advanced dual‑use technologies and defence equipment. India’s defence modernization and technological indigenization strategies must account for export-control constraints in supplier countries and pursue diversification of sources, domestic capacity building and targeted diplomacy.
  - Norm diffusion and transparency norms: The Wassenaar emphasis on transparency and responsible transfers contributes to international norms that shape global expectations about arms transfers. India’s own strategic culture — which balances strategic autonomy with normative commitments to responsible behaviour — can be informed by and contribute to these norms, especially as India increases its role in global non‑proliferation dialogues and defense exports.
  - Export-control architecture and domestic law: The Arrangement’s model—control lists, denial notifications and peer exchange—informs best practices for national export-control systems. India’s national export-control regime has evolved to reflect similar elements (licensing, end‑use/end‑user checks, denial mechanisms), and continued engagement with multilateral practices strengthens India’s regulatory capacity and credibility.
  - Strategic autonomy versus multilateral pressure: Because the Wassenaar Arrangement is non‑binding, India’s policy choices will continue to be shaped primarily by national interests. However, practical consequences—restricted technology transfers, reputational costs, and constrained defense procurement options—mean that India must manage relations with Wassenaar participants and seek cooperation where strategic and technological goals align.
  - Geopolitical shifts and regime effectiveness: The consensus-driven and voluntary nature of Wassenaar implies that geopolitical shifts among participating states can affect the coherence of controls. For India, this underscores the need to build resilient domestic industrial capabilities, diversify suppliers, and pursue strategic partnerships (including membership or closer alignment with other control regimes where feasible) to mitigate risks associated with external policy volatility.

Conclusion
The Wassenaar Arrangement represents a post‑Cold War, politically grounded approach to controlling conventional arms and dual‑use technologies. Its strengths lie in flexibility, technical updating and transparency mechanisms; its limits arise from non‑binding status, dependence on national implementation, and political dynamics among participants. For India, these characteristics have direct implications for technology acquisition, export-control practice, and strategic alignments. Understanding Wassenaar’s mechanisms and limitations is therefore important for Indian policymakers who must navigate the twin imperatives of acquiring critical technologies for security and upholding norms that reduce the risk of destabilizing transfers.

## The Wassenaar Arrangement: Structure, Lists and Relevance for Indian Export-Control Practice

The Wassenaar Arrangement is a multilateral, voluntary export-control arrangement that provides participating states with a harmonized framework for controlling transfers of sensitive dual-use goods and military items. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, Wassenaar matters because it shapes the categories, language and norms that Indian regulators use when assessing exports with potential military applications. What follows synthesises the Arrangement’s operational architecture and explains how it functions in practice—and why it matters for India’s export-control regime.

### Foundational document and legal character
- The operative framework for controls under Wassenaar is embodied in a single procedural instrument: the "Guidelines & Procedures, including the Initial Elements." This document sets out how items are listed, how participating states should consult one another, and the criteria for inclusion.
- Wassenaar is voluntary and consensus-based. It produces lists and guidance; implementation depends entirely on national legislation and political will. There is no supranational enforcement mechanism.

### The two core lists: Basic (dual-use) and Munitions
- Wassenaar maintains two distinct lists:
  - The Basic List (often called the List of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies): items with both civilian and potential military applications.
  - The Munitions List: military-specific items and technologies.
- The dual-use Basic List is structured and categorised in a manner intended to be readily translatable into national control lists; the Munitions List is separate and uses a different categorical approach.

### Organisation of the Basic List
- The Basic List is organised into ten categories, ordered roughly by increasing technological sophistication:
  1. Category 1 — Special Materials and Related Equipment
  2. Category 2 — Materials Processing
  3. Category 3 — Electronics
  4. Category 4 — Computers
  5. Category 5 — Telecommunications and Information Security (split into Part 1: Telecommunications; Part 2: Information Security)
  6. Category 6 — Sensors and Lasers
  7. Category 7 — Navigation and Avionics
  8. Category 8 — Marine
  9. Category 9 — Aerospace and Propulsion
  10. Category 0 — Miscellaneous (some numbering conventions vary as documents are updated)
- Within these categories the List employs two nested sensitivity gradations:
  - Sensitive — items warranting standard export licensing scrutiny.
  - Very Sensitive — items of higher potential military significance (examples: materials enabling stealth technology; equipment relevant to submarine detection; advanced radar components; certain jet engine technologies). Very Sensitive items typically trigger stricter licensing or notification practices at the national level.

### The five item-types (A–E)
Each category is further divided into five types of control that together capture the physical item and the means to make and use it:
- A = Physical goods and components (the finished articles, parts and assemblies).
- B = Plant, production and test equipment (machinery and test systems used to produce or qualify A items).
- C = Materials (raw or processed materials necessary for manufacture of A goods).
- D = Software (for development, production or use of controlled items).
- E = Technology (technical data, blueprints, know‑how for development, production or use).
- In general B–E refer back to corresponding A entries: the equipment, materials, software and technology that enable the creation, testing or operation of a given A-item. Exceptions exist: in some cases particular materials or technology are controlled even if no specific A-item is listed.

### The Munitions List
- The Munitions List is maintained separately and comprises a different set of categories (22 sub-categories in Wassenaar practice rather than the Basic List’s tenfold structure). Its focus is weapons and purely military systems.
- Because the Munitions List addresses overtly military items, its entries are less concerned with dual-use gradations and more with defining military capabilities that states prefer to control.

### Criteria for placing items on Wassenaar lists
Participating states use four principal tests when deciding whether an item should be listed:
1. Foreign availability outside participating states — is the item already widely available internationally?
2. Practicality of effective control — can exports of the item be meaningfully restricted at borders and by licensing?
3. Clarity of specification — can the item be described in clear, objective, technical terms to avoid arbitrariness?
4. Existing coverage by specialised regimes — is the item already controlled under another export-control regime (for example, the Australia Group for chemical/biological items, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), or the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR))? If so, redundancy and overlap are avoided.
- These inclusion criteria are designed to reduce politicised listings and to ensure that controls are technically defensible and implementable by national authorities.

### Interoperability: mapping to other classification systems
- Wassenaar categories are routinely mapped to other export-control classification frameworks to aid interoperability for exporters, customs authorities and regulators. For example:
  - Wassenaar Category 5.A.2 is commonly cross-referenced to the U.S. Commerce Control List entry ECCN 5A002 and to the EU’s corresponding control classification 5A002.
- Such mapping is particularly important for multi-jurisdictional trade flows and multinational corporations that must satisfy several national regimes simultaneously.
- Category 5 Part 2 (Information Security) requires special attention because it frequently covers cryptography-related controls, a technically nuanced and policy‑sensitive area for both trade and national security.

### National implementation and India’s practice
- Because Wassenaar is non‑binding, each participating state transposes Wassenaar-derived decisions into domestic law and administrative practice. Many national lists mirror Wassenaar but may be stricter or may add items of national concern.
- India became a participating state of the Wassenaar Arrangement in 2017 and has since integrated Wassenaar-derived language and categories into its national export-control architecture (notably through updates to India’s strategic trade control lists). India’s national list—often referred to in official usage as SCOMET (Special Chemicals, Organisms, Materials, Equipment and Technologies)—reflects both indigenous security priorities and obligations associated with international regimes.
- In practice this means:
  - Indian exporters must consult both the Wassenaar-derived classification and India’s implementing regulations before exporting.
  - Indian licensing authorities use the Sensitive vs. Very Sensitive gradation to shape licensing policy and the degree of inter-agency review or end-use verification required.
  - India may elect to impose controls that are stricter than Wassenaar’s baseline where national security considerations demand.

### Practical effect and limitations
- Practical effect:
  - Harmonised categories and A–E format provide a common technical language for export-control officials, industry compliance teams and customs agents—reducing ambiguity and easing cross-border enforcement.
  - Mapping to ECCN/EU codes improves transparency for exporters engaged in multijurisdictional trade.
- Limitations:
  - Wassenaar has no enforcement mechanism; compliance and enforcement are a function of national legal systems and administrative capacity.
  - Political consensus governs listing decisions; this can slow updates to the lists and make them conservative in scope.
  - The Arrangement intentionally emphasizes feasibility and objective technical specification for listings, which can leave gaps for rapidly evolving technologies or for items that are hard to define objectively.

### Conclusion: purpose and strategic significance
- The Wassenaar Arrangement’s Basic and Munitions Lists provide a structured, harmonised taxonomy and a set of control types designed to guide states’ export-control decisions for sensitive dual-use and military goods.
- For India, participation in Wassenaar has normative and practical implications: it strengthens technical interoperability with other supplier states, informs domestic licensing practice, and channels India’s strategic calculations about technology diffusion into a multilateral setting without surrendering sovereign control.
- Ultimately, Wassenaar functions as a technical and political forum where states balance trade facilitation with national security imperatives—an approach that aligns with India’s broader preference for multilateral rule‑making calibrated to preserve national discretion.

### Admission Criteria and the Politics of Membership: The Arrangement and India’s Accession

The Arrangement — commonly referred to as the Wassenaar Arrangement — is an archetypal example of a plurilateral export‑control mechanism that blends technical criteria with normative expectations. Its admission requirements and accession process illuminate both the legal‑technical architecture of contemporary non‑proliferation governance and the political dynamics by which states like India are integrated into multilateral regimes.

Key admission requirements
- States are expected to be active producers or exporters of arms or of sensitive industrial equipment and technologies. Membership is therefore oriented toward states with substantive trade or industrial capacity in controlled items.
- Applicants must maintain national non‑proliferation policies and appropriate implementing legislation and practices.
- Where applicable, adherents are expected to demonstrate coherence with other export‑control regimes: Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), and Australia Group. This reflects an expectation of policy harmonization across complementary regimes.
- Where relevant to a candidate’s legal situation, adherence to international non‑proliferation treaties is referenced: Treaty on the Non‑Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), and, where applicable, START I (including the Lisbon Protocol). The phrase “where applicable” is deliberately flexible to accommodate divergent treaty relationships among potential members.
- Candidates must demonstrate “fully effective” national export controls — interpreted practically to include domestic licensing systems, national control lists, end‑use and end‑user verification procedures, enforcement capacity (criminal and administrative), and interagency coordination mechanisms.
- Formally, the Arrangement is open on a global and non‑discriminatory basis to prospective adherents that satisfy the agreed criteria.

Admission mechanics and politics
- Admission of new members requires consensus among all existing participating states. In effect, every current member holds a veto over accession. This unanimity rule elevates political judgment alongside technical compliance in admissions decisions.
- Although the Arrangement is voluntary and decentralised — relying on national implementation, information exchange, and peer review rather than centralized enforcement — the consensus requirement means political alignments and strategic considerations often determine outcomes as much as legal‑technical compliance.
- Once consensus is reached, a set of administrative and procedural steps follows (for example, domestic procedural arrangements and formal notifications or deposits) before formal membership becomes operative. These steps are typically administrative, but they are necessary preconditions to active participation.

India’s accession as a case study
- India became the 42nd participating state of the Arrangement on 7 December 2017. Its application received explicit and politically consequential support from several major participants, notably Russia, the United States, France and Germany.
- The successful accession of India illustrates how the Arrangement’s “where applicable” language and pragmatic approach to treaty linkages can accommodate states with non‑standard treaty statuses. India is not a party to the NPT; the Arrangement’s flexible criteria allowed members to reconcile non‑proliferation objectives with the political decision to broaden participation.
- Support by leading participants was decisive in securing the unanimity needed for India’s admission; this underscores how endorsements from powerful members often tip the balance in consensus‑based fora.
- The procedural steps that followed consensus were administrative but necessary: India’s formal membership became effective only after those national and institutional preparations were completed.

Interpretation and implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- The Arrangement’s criteria combine technical capability (proof of production or export competence) with normative commitments (non‑proliferation posture). For India, accession served both a practical and symbolic function: it acknowledged India’s technological and industrial standing while signalling acceptance of its commitment to responsible export controls.
- The expectation of coherence with other regimes (NSG, MTCR, Australia Group) reveals the Arrangement’s role as part of an integrated export‑control architecture. For India’s policy community, membership contributed to a broader project of aligning India’s control practices with international standards without being constrained by particular treaty statuses.
- The unanimity rule means that technical compliance alone may not guarantee entry; accession requires political buy‑in from existing members. India’s entry thus reflected a convergence of strategic interests among major powers willing to broaden engagement with India despite unresolved normative debates about treaty participation.
- Operationally, “fully effective export controls” demanded institutional strengthening: licensing authorities, control lists calibrated to Arrangement parameters, end‑use checks, and enforcement mechanisms. These are concrete governance reforms that shape India’s domestic security bureaucracy and its capacity to manage sensitive trade.
- Finally, the Arrangement’s global openness — formally non‑discriminatory — coexists with subjective assessments of compliance and political judgment. India’s admission demonstrates how normative flexibility, technical adaptation, and great‑power support can combine to legitimate a non‑traditional entrant within a regime that is otherwise conservative about enlargement.

Notable point
- India’s accession as the 42nd participating state provides a concrete example of how the Arrangement expands in practice and how its flexible, case‑by‑case approach to treaty obligations permits accommodation of states with atypical treaty relationships.

Concluding observation
Membership in the Arrangement is more than a regulatory checkbox for India: it is a strategic instrument. It aligns with India’s aims to be recognised as a responsible actor in the trade of sensitive technologies; it strengthens domestic export‑control institutions; and it deepens security cooperation with major powers. At the same time, the politics of accession—consensus rules and the need for powerful sponsors—underscores that institutional inclusion in contemporary non‑proliferation regimes is as much a diplomatic achievement as it is a technical one.

### 2013 amendments to the Wassenaar Arrangement: intrusion software, surveillance controls, and implications for India’s strategic culture and policy

Background and what changed
- In December 2013 participants of the Wassenaar Arrangement agreed to amend the Arrangement’s control list to bring certain Internet-based surveillance technologies within the export‑control regime. The most notable additions were (a) “intrusion software” and (b) IP network surveillance systems.
- “Intrusion software” was defined in functional terms as software designed to defeat a computer or network’s protective measures and to extract data or information from computers or networks. The precise wording sought to capture tools used to remotely monitor, extract, or manipulate data in target systems.
- The declared policy purpose of the amendments was explicitly normative: to reduce the availability of powerful surveillance tools to repressive governments and thereby limit state‑enabled human‑rights abuses.

Why the changes mattered
- Conceptually, the 2013 amendments represented a significant extension of a traditionally hardware‑ and dual‑use‑oriented export‑control regime into the cyber domain. For the first time in the Wassenaar context, cyber‑offensive capabilities and surveillance software were singled out for cross‑border transfer controls.
- Practically, the change meant that exporters in participating states were expected to assess end‑uses and end‑users for certain classes of cyber tools and, where appropriate, seek licenses before transferring them abroad.

Industry reaction and practical problems
- Technology firms and security researchers raised immediate and sustained objections. Major platform providers and security actors (notably Google and Facebook in public statements) warned that the amendments as drafted risked sweeping too broadly and could inadvertently criminalize or restrict routine, legitimate cybersecurity practices.
- Specific concerns included:
  - Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments: activities central to preventative security could be read as “intrusion” if they involved tools or techniques that exploit or bypass protections.
  - Vulnerability disclosure, bug‑bounty programs and information sharing: restrictions might impede the identification and remediation of security flaws and the sharing of indicators of compromise across vendors and defenders.
  - Incident response and forensic analysis: lawfully assisting customers or partners after intrusions might involve tools that fit the definition.
- Firms argued that controls could therefore weaken, not strengthen, the security of participant countries by constraining defenders while leaving malicious actors in non‑participating states or illicit markets largely unaffected.

Technical and implementation challenges
- Definitions such as “intrusion software” are technically difficult to craft with sharp boundaries. Distinguishing offensive malware from defensive tools and benign research can be extremely context‑dependent.
- Because the Wassenaar Arrangement is not a treaty but a political multilateral regime, the amendments required national implementing legislation and licensing guidance. That created two adjacent risks:
  - Divergent implementation across participating states (regulatory fragmentation and compliance complexity for multinational firms); and
  - Overbroad national transpositions that could extend restrictions further than the multilateral text intended.
- The regime’s tools are inherently limited against non‑participants and illicit markets. Export controls can reduce legal supply from participating states but are blunt against illicit procurement, state‑to‑state transfers outside the regime, and indigenous development.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic tradeoff: The amendments illuminate a core tension in modern strategic culture between preventing the proliferation of tools that enable state surveillance and preserving an open, resilient digital ecosystem that supports national security and economic activity.
- For India, whether as a participant or an external stakeholder, several policy implications follow:
  - Cyber‑defence readiness: Overly restrictive export controls adopted by partners can indirectly constrain collaborative cybersecurity activities (threat‑sharing with vendors, cross‑border incident response) that India relies on for national resilience.
  - Industry growth and innovation: Indian technology companies and security researchers engaged in legitimate testing, disclosure and defensive product development could face indirect costs or market barriers if major markets impose broad controls that ripple into supply chains.
  - Human‑rights posture vs strategic autonomy: India’s policy choices must balance a normative commitment (to preventing misuse of surveillance tools) with a pragmatic need to maintain access to defensive technologies and to preserve freedom for domestic cyber research and industry.
  - Diplomatic leverage and harmonization: India’s engagement (diplomatic or through alignment) with export‑control norms can be leveraged to shape clarifications that protect defensive uses while curbing abusive export pathways.

Recommended considerations (operationalizing balance)
- Clarify technical definitions: Advocate for (and in national law adopt) precise, context‑sensitive definitions that distinguish malicious offensive malware from tools used for legitimate security research, incident response, and system administration.
- Explicit exemptions and carve‑outs: Implement clear, codified exemptions for bona fide security research, vulnerability disclosure programs, penetration testing conducted with authorization, and defensive tools used by network operators and CERTs.
- Harmonize implementation: Work with other participants to develop common licensing guidance and practical examples to reduce regulatory divergence and compliance burdens for multinational enterprises.
- Complementary measures: Pair export controls with measures aimed at non‑participating states and illicit markets—such as targeted sanctions, end‑use checks, capacity building for export‑control enforcement, and international cooperation on cybercrime investigations.
- Monitor human‑rights and security impacts: Institute periodic review mechanisms to assess whether export controls are achieving the human‑rights objective without unduly harming defensive capabilities; adjust rules in light of empirical evidence.
- Domestic policy alignment: Ensure India’s own export‑control and cyber‑security policies preserve capacity for defensive research and rapid incident response while preventing diversion to abusive actors.

Concluding analytical note
The 2013 Wassenaar amendments were an important early attempt to bring cyber tools within established non‑proliferation and export‑control practices. They exposed fundamental definitional, implementation, and policy dilemmas—dilemmas that speak directly to India’s strategic culture. For Indian policymakers the challenge is to endorse measures that deny repressive states easy access to intrusive surveillance while ensuring that export‑control regimes and domestic law do not inadvertently hobble the very actors (private sector defenders, CERTs, researchers) whose work protects national security and public safety. Pragmatic solutions—technical clarity, targeted exemptions, harmonized guidance, and complementary extraterritorial measures—can reconcile these objectives and should inform India’s engagement with multilateral export‑control norms.

## Wassenaar Arrangement — “Wassenaar minus one”: Section Analysis

This section examines the episode—discussed inside export-control circles as “Wassenaar minus one”—in which proposed amendments to the Wassenaar Arrangement’s (WA) listed items, debated during 2022–2023, failed to secure consensus and instead precipitated a wave of unilateral national measures that, in practice, produced broad convergence among advanced economies. The incident illustrates how the WA’s consensus model interacts with contemporary geopolitics and the practical realities of high‑technology controls.

### WA decision-making and the 2022–2023 proposals
- The Wassenaar Arrangement operates on a strict consensus rule: any single participating delegation can prevent an amendment from being adopted.
- In 2022–2023 states discussed proposals to update the WA’s “listed items” to capture emerging dual‑use technologies—most notably certain quantum‑computing capabilities, advanced semiconductor production equipment, and high‑performance AI chips and related optics/lasers for additive manufacturing.
- The proposals were not accepted in WA because the Russian delegation objected, thereby blocking consensus. This objection occurred against the background of Russia’s international isolation following its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

### Immediate outcome: national, unilateral controls in place of WA harmonisation
- Because WA amendments require consensus and were blocked, several states moved to adopt unilateral export‑control laws to address perceived national security risks rather than wait for formal multilateral harmonisation.
- Notable unilateral measures included:
  - Spain: introduced controls on quantum computing hardware using a performance threshold approach—controls applied to systems above ~34 qubits when accompanied by low two‑qubit (CNOT) error rates; additional constraints were announced for larger systems or those with higher gate‑error characteristics; Spain also included restrictions on cryogenic computing technologies tied to quantum‑capable systems.
  - Netherlands: imposed controls targeting equipment for manufacturing advanced‑process‑node semiconductors (key enabling tools such as advanced lithography, etch and deposition systems).
  - United States: announced controls focused on AI accelerators (specialised chips for training and inference) and on certain lasers and high‑precision cameras used in advanced metal additive manufacturing, reflecting concerns about military applications of 3D‑printed metal parts.

### From unilateral laws to de facto harmonisation
- Although the early measures were unilateral, from mid‑2024 many WA participants moved to adopt matching or closely similar export controls. The United Kingdom and Canada are prominent examples of countries that implemented corresponding measures.
- Within WA terminology these 2024 adoptions were formally described as “country‑specific” measures. That label is procedural: it denotes measures applied by individual states rather than formal changes to the WA Common Control Lists.
- Practically, however, the effect was convergence: like‑minded advanced economies implemented largely comparable restrictions, producing de‑facto harmonisation even in the absence of a formal WA amendment.

### Technical design choices and proxies for performance
- The contested items and the way they were regulated reveal the technical proxies policymakers used to capture dual‑use risks:
  - Quantum computing: thresholds based on qubit count combined with gate fidelity (e.g., two‑qubit/CNOT error rate) as an operational proxy for capability; separate controls for supporting cryogenic systems required for scalable quantum machines.
  - Advanced semiconductors: focus on tools that enable leading‑edge nodes (extreme‑ultraviolet lithography, advanced etchers/deposition systems) rather than on node definitions alone.
  - AI accelerators: targeting specialised inference/training accelerators and the transfer of enabling software or documentation that materially aids deployment.
  - Additive manufacturing optics/lasers: controls on lasers/cameras that enable high‑precision metal 3D printing used in critical defense applications.

### Why the proposals failed—and why states proceeded anyway
- The proximate cause of the WA impasse was a Russian objection. Given the consensus rule, that single objection prevented an amendment from being adopted.
- The broader cause was geopolitical: the Russia–Ukraine conflict had already hardened divisions among WA participants, reducing the willingness of some states to accept compromise on sensitive export controls.
- Faced with the need to protect critical technologies, states preferred to move unilaterally rather than leave policy gaps. When many of those unilaterals were similar, the result was a quasi‑multilateral regime achieved outside formal WA amendment procedures.

### Legal and practical consequences
- Classification as “country‑specific” can have legal ramifications: export licensing, legal interpretation, and administrative practice may differ from situations in which WA lists are formally amended. Exporters and licensing authorities therefore must grapple with a patchwork of national rules and distinct legal bases.
- Nevertheless, the broad convergence among advanced economies reduced some commercial uncertainty in practice. Exporters operating across multiple jurisdictions found many of the substantive restrictions converging, even as the statutory bases remained national.
- Rapid shifts from proposal to national implementation have created transitional compliance challenges and surprised some observers and firms, requiring expedited updates to licensing procedures and internal compliance programs.

### Implications for the WA and export‑control governance
- The episode underscores that the WA consensus model is vulnerable to geopolitical tensions; a single participant’s objection can block collective modernization.
- However, the situation also shows how convergence can occur informally: coordinated national action among like‑minded states can substitute for formal WA amendments, producing a functional export‑control regime outside the organisation’s formal amendment process.
- This dynamic carries both advantages and risks: it allows rapid policy responses but creates uneven legal foundations and potential political fragmentation if states diverge over time.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although India is not a WA participant, this episode matters to Indian policymakers for several reasons:
- Norm diffusion: when advanced economies converge de facto on control standards for quantum, AI chips, and semiconductor tools, global commercial and technical norms form that will shape supply‑chain access and expectations about permissible transfers. India’s technology firms and research institutions will face those norms when procuring, co‑developing, or exporting sensitive items.
- Policy posture: India must decide whether to align with like‑minded export‑control practices, develop independent national standards, or adopt a hybrid approach. Choices will reflect India’s strategic culture—balancing technological autonomy, industrial development, and concerns about proliferation or dual‑use diversion.
- Implementation capacity: adopting controls similar to those used by WA states requires technical expertise to define thresholds (e.g., in quantum performance), administrative bandwidth for licensing, and interagency coordination—areas where reforms may be necessary.
- Diplomacy and multilateral engagement: India can engage in bilateral and plurilateral dialogues (technology partnerships, export‑control capacity building) to shape evolving norms, even if it remains outside WA. Being proactive helps protect Indian industry from sudden supply restrictions and aligns export‑control practice with India’s strategic and economic goals.
- Industrial impact: controls on AI accelerators, semiconductor tools, and additive‑manufacturing optics will have downstream effects on India’s technology ecosystem. Policymakers should calibrate export controls to safeguard national security without unnecessarily constraining legitimate commercial and scientific activity.

Recommendations (brief)
- Monitor: closely track the convergence of national controls among WA participants to anticipate practical market impacts.
- Build capacity: invest in technical expertise within licensing authorities to assess performance‑based thresholds (quantum fidelity, chip FLOPS/INT8 metrics, etc.).
- Engage: pursue targeted diplomatic engagement with WA members and other partners to harmonise understandings and secure carve‑outs or licensing pathways for legitimate Indian industrial cooperation.
- Calibrate: design export‑control policy that balances strategic protection with growth, including clear licensing pathways for research collaboration and industry.

### Conclusion
The “Wassenaar minus one” episode illustrates how multilateral export‑control instruments can be weakened by geopolitical conflict, prompting states to employ unilateral measures that nonetheless coalesce into a de‑facto multilateral regime. For countries such as India—outside WA but integrated in global technology supply chains—the episode signals the importance of policy agility: monitoring norm formation, building regulatory capacity, and engaging selectively with partners to manage both the security and development dimensions of emerging technologies.

- Total participating states listed: 42  
- EU member states among the list (as of Dec 2017): 27  
- NATO member states among the list (as of Dec 2017): 26  
- Continents represented: Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa, Oceania

The Wassenaar Arrangement: purpose and institutional character
- Purpose: The WA is a voluntary, plurilateral forum for coordinating national export controls on conventional arms and on "dual‑use" goods and technologies (items that can have both civilian and military applications). Its central aim is to improve regional and international security and stability by promoting transparency and greater responsibility in transfers of potentially destabilizing items.
- Origins: Established in 1996 as a successor to the Cold War–era COCOM arrangements, WA embodies a post‑Cold War, multilateral approach, seeking to adapt export‑control cooperation to the realities of globalized high technology trade.
- Legal nature: The WA is not a treaty. Membership and decisions are voluntary and consensus‑based; it operates through agreed lists, best practices, information exchanges, and political commitment rather than binding legal obligations.
- Key instruments: The WA maintains two control lists—the Munitions List and the Dual‑Use List—updated periodically by participants. These lists form the core of harmonization efforts and guide national licensing and enforcement practices.
- Meetings and processes: Participants meet in plenary and working groups to update lists, share information (including denial and licensing practices), and coordinate approaches to emerging technologies. Changes require consensus, which both empowers participants and can slow adaptation.

Who participates and who does not
- Typical participants: WA membership tends to include major exporters of arms and high‑technology goods, reflecting an interest in mutual confidence‑building and reciprocal controls.
- Notable non‑members (as of Dec 2017): China and Brazil are not WA participants. Their absence has implications for the universality of WA norms and for geopolitical balancing—particularly where supply chains and procurement intersect with non‑participating suppliers.
- Russia’s participation: Russia’s presence on the WA roster is geopolitically significant, especially given the complex security relationships and competing alignments among WA members. The inclusion of states with divergent strategic outlooks demonstrates both the Arrangement’s broad reach and the political sensitivity that can attend membership.

Implications of membership — general and for India
- Signalling and normative alignment: Membership signals a state’s willingness to adhere to widely accepted export‑control norms and to coordinate with other major exporters. For India, WA participation signals a convergence with international non‑proliferation practices and a readiness to be treated as a responsible supplier and consumer of sensitive technologies.
- Practical benefits: Access to consensus lists and information exchanges can facilitate responsible procurement and enable India to both import and export higher‑end dual‑use and defense‑related items under clearer rules, aiding modernization of armed forces and defense industry cooperation with WA partners.
- Constraints and sovereignty considerations: Because WA controls focus on potentially sensitive technologies, membership imposes practical constraints on procurement choices and on the export policies of domestic industry. For a state that values strategic autonomy, such constraints must be balanced against the benefits of access and legitimacy.
- Institutional capacity and domestic implementation: WA membership typically requires domestic institutional reforms—establishing or strengthening licensing authorities, enforcement mechanisms, and transparency practices—changes that have governance costs but also reinforce institutionalized restraint consistent with non‑proliferation goals.
- Geopolitical balancing: For India, WA membership must be viewed in the context of its historic defence ties (notably with Russia), its expanding cooperation with Western suppliers, and its strategic calculus vis‑à‑vis China and other regional actors. Membership can both deepen ties with Western technology suppliers and raise questions about continuity of supply from non‑WA partners; managing those trade‑offs is part of India’s strategic policy making.

Concluding observation
- The December 2017 membership list of the Wassenaar Arrangement underscores the Arrangement’s role as a club of significant arms and advanced‑technology exporters committed to voluntary, consensus‑based export controls. For India, participation in the WA is a concrete expression of a strategic choice to embed parts of its national security and defence acquisition practices within internationally recognized export‑control norms—strengthening its status as a responsible actor while requiring institutional adjustments and careful geopolitical balancing.

### Chile

Chile’s engagement with multilateral export‑control regimes over the past decade offers a compact case study in how a middle power translates international non‑proliferation obligations into domestic reform and international outreach. Two interrelated facts frame Chile’s policy posture: since 2015 Chile has been a candidate for both the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Wassenaar Arrangement, and this candidacy has been explicitly linked to Chile’s implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1540 (2004).

Background and formal steps
- In 2015 Chile formally sought membership in the NSG and in the Wassenaar Arrangement. These candidacies signalled an intention to align Chilean export controls with the norms and practices of established supplier regimes that govern, respectively, nuclear‑related transfers (NSG) and conventional arms plus dual‑use goods and technologies (Wassenaar).
- As part of its transparency and reporting obligations, Chile submitted a report to the UN in 2017 concerning national measures to prevent arms and weapons‑related proliferation. That submission incorporated a National Plan of Action for 2017–2021. The Plan explicitly set targets including attaining membership of the NSG and the Wassenaar Arrangement by 2021.

Legal, institutional and procedural responsibilities
- Membership candidacies require more than declaratory intent. Candidate states normally must demonstrate legal, regulatory and institutional alignment with regime guidelines: comprehensive export‑control laws, effective licensing systems, end‑use/end‑user checks, enforcement and penalties, and inter‑agency coordination mechanisms.
- Transparency and peer engagement are also central. Regimes expect substantive dialogue with existing members, provision of information on controls, and sometimes on‑site contacts or evaluations. Chile’s 2017 report and its National Plan represent exactly this mix of transparency and a sequenced reform agenda.

UNSCR 1540 as a driver
- UNSCR 1540 (2004) obliges all UN member states to adopt and enforce measures preventing non‑state actors from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and related materials, and explicitly calls for appropriate controls on related transfers. For many aspirant members of supplier regimes, compliance with 1540 provides both the legal imperative and the diplomatic rationale for strengthening export controls.
- Chile’s National Plan of Action (2017–2021) can be read as a concrete, time‑bound effort to translate 1540 obligations into domestic capacity—legislation, customs and licensing reforms, capacity‑building, and regular reporting.

Typical elements of a National Plan of Action
Chile’s plan reflected a set of measures commonly found in such documents:
- Adoption or updating of export‑control legislation to cover controlled lists and licensing authorities.
- Strengthening customs procedures and border controls to detect and interdict prohibited transfers.
- Establishing or improving licensing and end‑use verification mechanisms.
- Capacity‑building for administrative and enforcement personnel (customs, police, prosecutors).
- Institutionalising inter‑agency coordination and external reporting to international partners and regimes.

Political and technical dynamics of membership
- Membership decisions in both the NSG and Wassenaar Arrangement are made by consensus among current members. Thus accession is simultaneously a technical adjudication (does the candidate meet the required standards?) and a political negotiation (are existing members willing to admit the candidate given bilateral and regional considerations?).
- For Chile, success would enhance its non‑proliferation credentials and embed it more fully in supplier‑regime governance. Failure, or delays, may reflect either residual technical gaps or geopolitical considerations among existing members.

Implications and comparative lessons
- Chile’s candidacies demonstrate how middle powers use regime membership as both a substantive policy goal (strengthen controls, prevent proliferation) and a reputational strategy (signal commitment to international norms).
- The 2017–2021 timeline exemplifies the utility of measurable, time‑bound national plans in mobilising domestic reform and international confidence‑building.
- For other states seeking similar integration, the Chile case underscores two realities: (1) achieving regime standards requires legal and institutional reforms across multiple agencies, and (2) success depends on sustained transparency and diplomatic engagement with current members to overcome the consensus requirement.

In sum, Chile’s experience illustrates the practical interplay between UNSCR 1540 obligations, national reform planning, and the political‑technical processes of supplier‑regime accession. For scholars of strategic culture and national security policy, it offers a concise example of how normative commitments and institutional capacity combine in a country’s effort to reshape its external identity as a responsible supplier and non‑proliferation partner.
