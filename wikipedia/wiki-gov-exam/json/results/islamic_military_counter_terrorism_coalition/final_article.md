## The Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC): Overview and Strategic Implications for India

Summary
- The Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) is an intergovernmental military alliance formed to coordinate counter‑terrorism efforts among Muslim-majority states.
- Announced by Saudi Defence Minister Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud on 15 December 2015, the coalition signalled Saudi leadership in a regionally‑framed counter‑terrorism initiative.
- IMCTC membership is drawn overwhelmingly from members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC); reported membership figures in source material vary (initially 34, later cited as 42–43), with Kenya reported to have joined on 1 September 2022.
- General Raheel Sharif, the former Pakistan Army Chief, was named the IMCTC’s first commander on 6 January 2017.
- A joint operations centre was envisaged for Riyadh, indicating intent to coordinate operations, intelligence‑sharing and planning, although publicly available operational detail has been limited.

Definition, genesis and stated purpose
- The IMCTC was presented by its sponsors as a collaborative, military‑level coalition of Muslim‑majority states “to confront terrorism and violent extremism,” with an explicit focus on groups such as the Islamic State (ISIS). Its creation in late 2015 should be read against the high watermark of international concern about ISIS, the Syrian conflict, and transnational jihadist networks.
- Saudi Arabia’s public announcement and the Riyadh location for a planned joint operations centre place the initiative firmly within Saudi strategic projection: it is simultaneously an instrument of counter‑terrorism, intra‑Muslim diplomatic outreach, and regional influence.

Timeline (key dates)
- 15 Dec 2015 — Coalition announced by Saudi defence minister Mohammad bin Salman.
- 6 Jan 2017 — General Raheel Sharif (former Pakistan Army Chief) named first commander.
- 1 Sep 2022 — Kenya announced as a joining member (sources cite this as bringing membership to 42; other sources list 43).

Leadership, membership and institutional form
- Leadership: appointing General Raheel Sharif — a senior, widely‑recognised military professional — was intended to lend immediate credibility and operational tone to the coalition. His appointment also underscored Pakistan–Saudi defence links.
- Membership: most participating states are members of the OIC, reflecting the IMCTC’s religious‑regional composition rather than universal multilateralism. Reported member counts in open materials are inconsistent (34 at announcement; later sources quote 42 or 43). This discrepancy requires verification from IMCTC primary records and independent databases.
- Institutional form: the coalition is framed as a collective military instrument but, in public documentation, lacks detailed published rules of engagement, a clear legal mandate (for example, UN authorization vs. ad‑hoc national authorities), or transparent, persistent operational reporting.

Operational intent and capacity
- The planned joint operations centre in Riyadh signals ambition for centralized planning, coordination and intelligence‑sharing. However, beyond announcements, there has been limited public disclosure of specific joint operations, force contributions, logistics or command arrangements.
- Comparing intent and capability is necessary: naming a high‑profile commander communicates seriousness; converting that into sustained joint operations requires enduring political will, interoperability, funding and legal frameworks across diverse national militaries.

Observations and strategic implications
- Saudi leadership: IMCTC functions as an instrument of Saudi regional policy. It allows Riyadh to lead a counter‑terrorism agenda in which it positions itself as provider of security leadership to the Muslim world.
- Professional credibility and regional cooperation: appointing an experienced commander from Pakistan sought to combine professional military leadership with regional acceptability. It also highlights the role of established military elites in legitimising new coalitions.
- Geopolitical framing: the coalition’s focus on ISIS and similar threats places it within the broader international counter‑ISIS architecture (including the US‑led coalition), but the IMCTC’s regional and religious composition differentiates its political logic — it is as much about intra‑Muslim state diplomacy as about kinetic counter‑terrorism.
- Transparency and membership ambiguity: inconsistent membership figures and limited operational transparency raise questions about the coalition’s coherence, longevity and effectiveness. Without clear public reporting, assessments of capability remain tentative.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India is not a member of the IMCTC. Nevertheless, the coalition matters to Indian strategic calculations for several reasons:
  - Counter‑terrorism cooperation in the Indian Ocean and South Asia: several IMCTC members have direct or indirect stakes in South Asian security, maritime routes and counter‑terror networks. India must track cooperative security initiatives that could affect regional threat perceptions and intelligence flows.
  - Bilateral diplomacy with key states: Saudi leadership of the IMCTC and Saudi–Pakistan military collaboration (e.g., appointment of a Pakistani commander) intersect with India’s bilateral diplomacy with Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and other Gulf states. India’s relationships with these countries shape its access to intelligence and operational cooperation against shared threats.
  - Multilateral preferences: India traditionally prefers UN‑centred and inclusive multilateral frameworks for security cooperation. The IMCTC’s religiously framed composition underscores a competing model — regionally bound coalitions formed on cultural–religious lines — and thus presents both opportunities for bilateral cooperation and challenges for India’s normative preference for universalistic institutions.
  - Domestic and diaspora considerations: as Indian policy-makers calibrate counter‑terrorism approaches, they must be mindful of how externally led, Muslim‑majority coalitions are perceived domestically and among India’s large diaspora communities in Gulf states.

Recommended areas for further research and verification
- Confirm current, official IMCTC membership from the coalition’s primary sources and independent international databases to resolve discrepancies (34 → 42 → 43).
- Clarify the legal mandate and rules of engagement: Is there UN endorsement, or do operations proceed under national authorities and bilateral agreements?
- Assess operational record: catalogue any joint missions, exercises, intelligence‑sharing incidents, and the scale of troop or resource contributions by member states.
- Analyse coordination with other counter‑ISIS efforts (e.g., the US‑led coalition) to determine overlap, deconfliction, or strategic competition.
- Investigate political motives and critiques: examine critiques concerning transparency, inclusivity, the coalition’s role in intra‑Muslim diplomacy, and measurable effectiveness.

Concluding note
The IMCTC is an instructive case of how state actors blend counter‑terrorism objectives with regional leadership ambitions. For India — with its own counter‑terrorism priorities, complex Gulf relationships and normative preference for inclusive multilateralism — the IMCTC is both a potential partner arena and a reminder that security coalitions are instruments of broader geopolitical strategy. Robust evaluation of the IMCTC’s membership, legal basis, and operational record is essential for any substantive assessment of its strategic significance to India.

### The Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC): Objectives, Composition and Strategic Implications

Background and stated purpose
- The IMCTC was announced with an explicit, declarative objective: to "protect Muslim countries from all terrorist groups and organisations irrespective of their sect or name." This formulation situates the coalition within the language of transnational counter‑terrorism while foregrounding a civilizational frame — protection of "Muslim countries" — that blends security rhetoric with identity-based collective responsibility.
- The coalition publicly affirmed it would operate “in line with” United Nations and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) provisions on terrorism. Such appeals to UN/OIC norms are significant: they aim to confer international legitimacy and to present the IMCTC as consistent with established multilateral legal and normative frameworks even where no explicit UN mandate for coalition operations has been declared.

Operational intentions and theatres of focus
- At the launch press conference, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman identified specific conflict theatres — Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and Afghanistan — as areas where the coalition would “coordinate” efforts. Explicit reference to Syria and Iraq was coupled with statements about international coordination “with major powers and international organisations” for operations in those theatres.
- The naming of Syria and Iraq as operational foci is notable given that both countries’ post‑2011 governments, along with Iran, were excluded from the coalition. This creates a dissonance between operational intent (working in certain states) and formal inclusivity (excluding their governments), with important implications for legal authority and local consent when operations are contemplated.

Membership, composition and sectarian readings
- Membership is dominated by majority‑Sunni states; the alliance explicitly excludes countries with Shia‑dominated governments, with Iran, Iraq and Syria cited as outside the coalition. This line of exclusion produced immediate contestation: some observers and regional actors interpreted the IMCTC as a Sunni‑led bloc, and Iraqi MP Hakeem Azameli characterized it bluntly as “a sectarian coalition.”
- External commentary and reporting have framed the coalition as part of Saudi Arabia’s broader strategy to assert leadership in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in rivalry with Iran. Such readings emphasise the coalition’s political and prestige functions in addition to operational counter‑terror aims.
- Nonetheless, the membership picture is not a perfect Sunni monolith. Oman — an Ibadi majority state with a long practice of pragmatic diplomacy and mediation — joined the IMCTC, signaling some cross‑sectarian and pragmatic engagement. Lebanon expressed support. Reports also suggest that several member or supporting states have maintained cordial or working relations with Iran (Bangladesh, Kuwait, Libya and Pakistan are cited in some accounts), though such claims require careful verification.

Command, leadership and institutional form
- In March 2016 Saudi authorities reportedly approached Pakistan’s then‑Army Chief Raheel Sharif to take command of the IMCTC after his retirement. The request, and the emphasis on appointing an experienced senior military leader, indicates that the coalition was envisaged to possess — or at least to explore — a centralized, professional military command beyond an informal coordination forum.
- Seeking a retired army chief as commander underscores the IMCTC’s ambition for operational coherence and organizational discipline, but also raises questions about the chain of command, the legal basis for operations across sovereign territories, and the domestic political ramifications for nations whose personnel might lead or participate.

Geopolitical dynamics and wider implications
- The IMCTC sits at the intersection of counter‑terrorism, inter‑Islamic politics and regional great‑power competition. By tying its identity to the protection of “Muslim countries” while excluding some Muslim governments, the coalition risks reinforcing sectarian narratives that can reduce opportunities for broader regional cooperation against non‑state violent extremists.
- The stated intention to coordinate with “major powers and international organisations” points to the potential internationalization of its activities. Such coordination could intersect — cooperatively or competitively — with the policies of NATO, the United States, Russia and multilateral counter‑terror frameworks, thereby creating complex diplomatic and operational interactions in theaters such as Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
- Pakistan’s potential leadership role (and the presence of other states with varying ties to Iran) complicates intra‑regional diplomacy. For countries like Pakistan, participation or leadership entails domestic political costs, tilt considerations between Riyadh and Tehran, and implications for relations with India.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India is neither a member nor a direct addressee of the IMCTC project, but the coalition’s emergence matters to Indian strategic calculations in several respects:
  - Norms and legitimacy: India’s preference for multilateralism, legal mandates and non‑sectarian frameworks in counter‑terror cooperation leads it to view coalitions that lay claim to civilisational protection with caution. The IMCTC’s invocation of UN/OIC alignment without an explicit UN mandate underscores the gap between normative claims and operational legality — a gap India generally highlights in its international posture.
  - Regional stability and theatres of operation: The IMCTC’s focus on Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria touches directly on environments where India has strategic interests. Any coalition activity that affects local power balances, proxies or insurgent networks can have second‑order security consequences for India, including impacts on Indian investments, diaspora safety, and the broader threat environment emanating from Afghanistan and West Asia.
  - Pakistan dimension: The reported offer to Raheel Sharif and Pakistan’s cited involvement are particularly consequential. Indian policymakers must assess whether Pakistani engagement in the IMCTC changes Islamabad’s security calculations, creates new coalitions of influence in the Gulf, or affects cross‑border terrorism dynamics. The possibility of Pakistani military figures playing visible roles in a Saudi‑led initiative carries both reputational and practical implications for India–Pakistan competition and for India’s engagements with Gulf states.
  - Great‑power interactions: If the IMCTC coordinates with major powers, this could alter how external actors approach counter‑terrorism in the Middle East and Central/South Asia. India’s strategic culture — which balances autonomy with select partnerships — will require recalibration in bilateral and multilateral engagements to safeguard its interests amid shifting coalitional alignments.

Conclusion
- The IMCTC illustrates how counter‑terrorism initiatives are simultaneously security instruments and instruments of regional influence. Its stated aim to defend “Muslim countries” and its declared alignment with UN/OIC norms aim to cloak the coalition in legitimacy; yet the coalition’s membership choices, operational focus on states excluded from its membership, and the Saudis’ leadership role produce immediate questions about sectarian politics, legal authority for operations, and geopolitical intent.
- For India, the IMCTC is not simply an external development to be observed; it is a variable in a regional security environment that affects India’s interests in West Asia and South Asia. Indian strategy is therefore likely to respond through continued emphasis on legal multilateralism, careful diplomatic balancing with Gulf actors, and vigilant tracking of shifts in military‑political coalitions that could have downstream effects on India’s national security.

### Chapter X — The Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC): Membership, Composition and Strategic Implications

Summary
- The Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) is a Saudi‑led multilateral counter‑terrorism forum announced by Saudi Arabia on 15 December 2015. At its original announcement 34 states were listed as participants; those initial participants were all members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and together represented roughly 60% of OIC membership.  
- Membership has expanded since 2015. As of May 2025 the coalition lists 43 members; the most recent accession recorded here is Cameroon (joined 1 May 2025). The IMCTC functions largely as a political‑military grouping of Muslim‑majority states that signals collective intent on counter‑terrorism, though its legal and operational instruments for joint action remain subject to interpretation and further documentation.

Membership: table structure and coding
- Purpose of the membership table: to distinguish between (a) formal accession timing, (b) willingness to provide military assistance, and (c) political/supporter roles.  
- Column definitions:  
  - Country — formal name of the state.  
  - Membership announcement (timing) — when the country’s accession was announced or first reported. Blank cells indicate missing or unpublished timing in the source data.  
  - Military role — whether the country has offered to provide military assistance if needed (α). A “Yes” indicates an expressed willingness to contribute forces or direct military assistance; it does not quantify scale, conditions, command arrangements or rules of engagement. Blank cells indicate the offer was not recorded in the source table.  
  - Supporter — denotes political backing, intelligence/logistics support or other non‑combat contributions as recorded; the specific scope is not specified in the source.  
  - References — primary source citations (IMCTC statements, government releases, OIC records); blanks signal that formal references were not supplied with the summary data.  
- Footnote: (α) “Military role” = country has offered to provide military assistance if needed. This is a binary indicator in the source and should not be conflated with operational deployments, troop numbers, or command consent.

Geographic and political composition
- Geographic spread: IMCTC membership spans the Middle East, North Africa, West Africa, East Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. This trans‑regional reach is notable for a coalition focused on an issue—terrorism—that crosses national and sub‑regional lines.  
- Political diversity: Members include monarchies and republics, steady and fragile states, and countries with ongoing internal conflicts. The mix ranges from veteran military powers (Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan) to smaller states with limited expeditionary capability (Comoros, Maldives) and states whose domestic instability complicates outward military commitment (Libya, Somalia, Mali, Syria not listed here).  
- OIC linkage: The IMCTC’s initial membership being exclusively OIC members underscores the coalition’s framing within a broader Muslim‑majority state diplomatic architecture rather than as a universal multilateral security institution.

Operational and political implications
- Operational implication of “Yes” in military role: an expressed willingness to contribute forces or military assistance. Crucially, the dataset does not specify: force size, force posture (advisory vs. combat), legal mandates, national caveats, command arrangements or deployment geography. Absent those details, the indicator is a signal of intent rather than evidence of operational interoperability.  
- Political implication of “Supporter”: likely denotes political endorsement, logistical or intelligence support, or diplomatic backing in relevant fora. The scope may range from public statements to concrete non‑combat assistance; the dataset does not disaggregate these roles.  
- Coordination challenges: the wide disparity in military capacity, interoperability, languages, defence doctrines and national priorities creates predictable friction for any attempt at sustained joint operations. Divergent threat perceptions and political incentives (regional rivalries, domestic politics) further complicate coalition cohesion.  
- Legal and institutional questions: the IMCTC is Saudi‑led and presents itself as a multilateral counter‑terrorism forum among Muslim‑majority states. However, formal legal frameworks (status of forces agreements, rules for cross‑border operations, UN authorizations, or OIC mandates) that would govern collective action remain diffusely defined in public records and require scrutiny.

Data quality, ambiguity and verification
- Data gaps: numerous entries in the membership table lack dates, and many countries have blank fields for “Military role” or “Supporter.” These blanks may reflect: (a) genuinely pending or informal accession; (b) observer or associate status not fully recorded; or (c) limits of the secondary source used to compile the table.  
- Verification need: for authoritative work, dates and role‑designations should be cross‑checked against primary sources—IMCTC official releases; individual government statements and defence ministry communiqués; OIC membership records and meeting minutes; and reputable security databases (ICG, SIPRI, Oxford Analytica, etc.). Time‑stamped primary documents are essential to distinguish between announced intent and enacted participation.

Strategic and normative critiques (summary)
- Critical observations commonly raised about the IMCTC: questions about political motives (regional influence, sectarian framing), practical interoperability (command, logistics, communications), human rights and rule‑of‑law safeguards during counter‑terror operations, and coordination or friction with established international bodies (UN counter‑terrorism systems, African Union, ASEAN, European partners). These critiques are not unique to the IMCTC but are salient given its composition and leadership.

Recommendations for researchers and policymakers
- Short practical steps to improve analytic clarity:  
  1) Systematically confirm membership dates and accession instruments for blank entries with primary IMCTC sources and government releases.  
  2) Seek official definitions or case‑by‑case descriptions of what “Supporter” entails (political endorsement vs. logistics vs. intelligence or funding).  
  3) Identify empirically which members have actually contributed forces, participated in joint exercises or provided concrete non‑combat assistance since 2015; document scale, legal basis and command arrangements.  
- Analytical caution: treat “Yes” indicators as signals of intent; avoid conflating them with actual operational capability or regularized interoperability without corroborating evidence.

Concluding note (relevance to India’s strategic culture)
- For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the IMCTC provides a case study in how state‑led, identity‑framed coalitions attempt to marshal regional partners against transnational threats. India’s approach to such coalitions will be informed by three overlapping considerations: (a) normative commitments to international law and multilateral dispute resolution; (b) pragmatic assessments of interoperability and burden‑sharing; and (c) geopolitical calculation about regional influence (particularly vis‑à‑vis Saudi, Turkish, Pakistani and Gulf actors). Any Indian engagement or response should therefore be based on verified membership data, clear operational mandates, and assessment of legal and reputational risks.

Sources and further verification (recommended primary sources)
- IMCTC official website and press releases; government ministries of defence and foreign affairs for member states; Organisation of Islamic Cooperation records; and secondary validation from established security databases (SIPRI, IISS, ICG).

### The following are non-member supporting nations:

- France  
- United Kingdom  
- United States

Context and analysis

This short list identifies Western states that have been described in public reporting and commentary as “supporting” the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) without being formal members. The IMCTC is a Saudi‑led counterterrorism coalition established in 2015, composed principally of majority‑Muslim countries. The designation “supporting” here is deliberately distinct from formal membership: it signals some degree of cooperation or endorsement while stopping short of accession to the coalition’s roster.

What “support” can mean

Because the underlying references do not specify modalities, it is important to unpack the range of activities typically encompassed by non‑member support for a coalition such as the IMCTC. Common forms include:

- Intelligence sharing and analytical cooperation (information exchange about extremist networks, battlefield reporting, etc.).  
- Training and capacity‑building for partner forces and security services (counter‑IED, border security, investigative best practices).  
- Logistical assistance and technical support (surveillance systems, secure communications, maintenance).  
- Political endorsement and diplomatic engagement that lends international legitimacy to coalition initiatives.  
- Ad hoc operational coordination short of direct combat deployment (overflight rights, basing access, or permissive arrangements for partner activities).

Why Western powers might remain non‑members

The choice by France, the United Kingdom, or the United States to support IMCTC activities without joining as formal members is driven by legal, political, and strategic considerations:

- Alliance and legal frameworks: NATO members and treaty partners operate within pre‑existing collective defence and legal commitments that can complicate formal accession to region‑led military coalitions.  
- Preference for bilateralism or multilateralism under different umbrellas: Western states often favour NATO, UN, or ad hoc coalition mechanisms compatible with their laws and parliamentary oversight rather than regionally led formations.  
- Political sensitivities: Formal membership can be politically costly at home or in third states if coalition members’ policies are controversial. Endorsement or selective cooperation preserves flexibility.  
- Operational control and standards: Differences in rules of engagement, human‑rights frameworks, and accountability mechanisms can make formal integration difficult; supporting states may therefore limit engagement to non‑combat forms of assistance.

Strategic effects of Western support

Western endorsement of a regional counterterrorism coalition carries important practical and symbolic benefits:

- Legitimacy: Engagement by major powers confers international legitimacy and can broaden the coalition’s diplomatic reach.  
- Capability transfer: Western states provide advanced ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), technical expertise, and institutional practices that raise partner capacity.  
- Risk mitigation: By remaining supporting partners rather than members, Western states can influence coalition activity while limiting legal and political exposure associated with formal membership.

Political and ethical sensitivities

Support for a coalition like the IMCTC is not politically neutral. Cooperation may attract scrutiny because:

- Some member states’ counterterrorism practices have been criticized on human‑rights and rule‑of‑law grounds; partners risk reputational spillover.  
- Regional rivalries and sectarian perceptions can transform technical cooperation into politically charged signalling.  
- Domestic legal oversight (parliamentary scrutiny, export controls) may constrain the forms of permissible assistance.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy

For India—an actor that pursues a cautious, interest‑driven approach to multilateral security cooperation—the IMCTC case offers several lessons:

- Selective engagement: India can (and does) favour bilateral capacity‑building and UN‑centred multilateralism when regional coalitions raise political complexities.  
- Value of capability partnerships: Technical and intelligence cooperation with advanced partners can strengthen India’s counterterrorism posture without formal membership in external coalitions.  
- Risk management: India’s decisions will weigh operational benefits against reputational costs and domestic legal/political constraints, mirroring the calculus of Western supporting states.

Caveats and the need for verification

The term “supporting” in brief lists is imprecise. To assess the exact nature and extent of France, the UK, or the US role with the IMCTC requires verification of primary sources—official statements, memoranda of understanding, parliamentary records, or concrete instances of cooperation. Researchers should distinguish between rhetorical endorsement, technical assistance, observer roles, and legally binding commitments before drawing firm conclusions.

Concluding note

The presence of major Western states as non‑member supporters of the IMCTC illustrates how states can buttress regional security initiatives without formal accession. For students of India’s strategic culture, this pattern underscores familiar trade‑offs between multilateral engagement, alliance constraints, legal oversight, and the political optics of security cooperation.

### Prospective Additional Members

At the time of its launch in late 2015, the Saudi‑led Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) announced broad signatures of support from a large number of Muslim‑majority states — “more than ten” other Islamic countries publicly expressed backing for the initiative. That early show of support, however, did not translate into immediate, stable, or universal accession. The subsequent sequence of statements, clarifications and invitations over 2016–2023 illustrates how the politics of membership in a regionally‑led military counter‑terrorism body intersect with enduring national foreign‑policy orientations and shifting geopolitical constraints.

Country cases and key developments
- Indonesia. As the world’s largest Muslim‑majority country, Indonesia’s early expression of support for the IMCTC carried symbolic weight. Yet Indonesia’s foreign‑policy doctrine — commonly described as “non‑aligned” or “free and active” — operates as a practical constraint on formal membership in an overt military coalition. In 2018 former deputy defence minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin explicitly invoked that doctrine to rule out joining a military alliance, and Vice President Jusuf Kalla publicly disagreed with accession. These statements are illustrative: senior executive officials in Jakarta, by invoking strategic culture and constitutional posture, effectively forestalled membership despite initial openness to cooperation on counter‑terror issues.
- Azerbaijan. Early media reports suggested Baku was in discussions about joining the IMCTC, but by January 2017 Azerbaijan’s government declared that accession was “not on the agenda.” This posture is consistent with Azerbaijan’s broader geopolitical balancing: its foreign policy must accommodate relationships with neighbours and great‑power patrons (notably Russia and Turkey) and avoid steps that would be perceived as aligning it militarily with one regional bloc against others.
- Tajikistan. Kabul’s northern neighbour showed more active interest. Tajikistan’s ambassador to Riyadh confirmed that Dushanbe was “seriously studying” the possibility of joining the IMCTC — a calculation driven by domestic security concerns, the reality of porous borders, and the presence of transnational extremist networks affecting Central Asia. Even so, study and interest fall short of accession; the decision calculus includes legal, operational and alliance implications that require careful domestic deliberation.
- Tanzania. In a later phase of outreach, on 16 August 2023 IMCTC Secretary General Maj.‑Gen. Ahmed Al‑Maghedi publicly invited the United Republic of Tanzania to join and cooperate on countering terrorism and violent extremism. The invitation signals a deliberate IMCTC strategy to expand its footprint in Africa — a continent with numerous Muslim‑majority and mixed states where counter‑terrorism cooperation can enhance the coalition’s operational and political reach.

Cross‑cutting dynamics and timeline
- Initial enthusiasm (2015–2016): The launch generated wide rhetorical support among Muslim‑majority states, reflecting shared concerns about jihadi groups and a desire for Muslim‑led responses to Islamist militancy.
- Reassessment and restraint (2017–2018): Early enthusiasm was tempered by sober national decision‑making. States recalibrated in light of constitutional constraints (Indonesia’s non‑alignment), elite disagreement (statements by senior ministers and vice‑presidents), and geopolitical balancing (Azerbaijan).
- Renewed outreach and geographic diversification (2019–2023): The IMCTC continued to court new members, with explicit invitations beyond the Gulf — for example to African states such as Tanzania — reflecting a strategy to broaden membership beyond the Middle East and Central Asia.

Analytical themes
- Support is not membership. Public expressions of sympathy or interest at the time of an organisation’s launch are politically useful but analytically distinct from formal accession. Membership requires domestic legal review, intergovernmental negotiations and often parliamentary or executive‑level political approval.
- National strategic culture shapes outcomes. Indonesia’s reflexive caution about alliances — rooted in its “free and active” orientation — demonstrates how enduring strategic culture can trump short‑term affinity. Similarly, Azerbaijan’s pragmatic neutrality reflects its regional imperatives.
- Domestic politics and elite preferences matter. Pronouncements by high‑level national officials (defence ministers, vice‑presidents, ambassadors) can be decisive. Internal disagreements among elites often explain why initial support does not become formal affiliation.
- Geographic diversification as a deliberate strategy. The IMCTC’s outreach to African states signals an intent to expand both the coalition’s symbolic legitimacy among the world’s Muslim communities and its practical capacity for cross‑regional intelligence, logistics and training cooperation.
- Membership decisions are multidimensional. States weigh legal obligations, operational interoperability, diplomatic signalling, and potential costs to other bilateral relationships. The result is a careful, sometimes slow accession process.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and security policy
Although India is not a member and approaches regional security through a different set of institutions, the IMCTC’s membership dynamics illuminate broader lessons relevant to New Delhi. India’s own strategic culture — sceptical of formal military alignments and privileging strategic autonomy — mirrors the concerns articulated by several prospective IMCTC members. New Delhi’s counter‑terror cooperation thus tends to prioritize flexible, issue‑specific partnerships, capacity building and multilateral norms rather than permanent military coalitions. At the same time, the IMCTC’s geographic diversification into Africa and Central Asia could affect the international counter‑terror environment in which India operates, creating both opportunities for parallel cooperation (training, intelligence‑sharing) and the need to manage overlapping diplomatic spaces.

Concluding observation
The trajectory from initial signs of support to cautious deliberation and selective expansion demonstrates that coalition‑building among states with diverse strategic cultures is a process — not an event. The IMCTC’s efforts to broaden membership bring into relief the competing logics of symbolic Muslim‑led responses to terrorism and the sober realities of national foreign‑policy constraints. For scholars of strategic culture and practitioners in heterogeneous regions, these membership dynamics are a reminder that organisational ambition must be reconciled with the sovereign prerogatives and domestic politics of would‑be members.

### Commanders

Summary of source entry
- The source material presents a single-row table of commanders with columns: Commander | Nationality | Start of tenure | End of tenure.
- The lone entry names General Raheel (Sharif/Shareef) as the commander, lists his nationality as Pakistan, gives a start date of 6 January 2017, and records the end of tenure as “Incumbent.”
- The source table contains a formatting anomaly (an extra pipe) that produces an empty cell between the name and nationality.

Reproduced entry (as given)
| Commander | Nationality | Start of tenure | End of tenure |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| General Raheel Shareef | Pakistan | 6 January 2017 | Incumbent |

Notes on accuracy and form
- “Incumbent” in the table indicates the source had no recorded end date; it does not guarantee current incumbency. The reader should verify the present office-holder against up‑to‑date IMCTC communications or reputable news sources.
- Name variants appear in open sources (e.g., “Raheel Sharif” vs. “Raheel Shareef”); searches should use variants to ensure comprehensive results.
- The table lacks contextual fields that are important for understanding the office: appointing authority, term length, formal duties, and any confirmation process. The extra delimiter in the original source suggests the row may be incomplete or mis‑formatted.

Contextual analysis and significance
- Personal credentials: the table’s subject, General Raheel Sharif, is notable for having served as Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff (2013–2016). That prior role gives him substantial operational and political profile in the region, which helps explain why his appointment to a transnational counter‑terrorism coalition would be prominent.
- Institutional origin and leadership politics: the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) is a Saudi‑led initiative established in 2015 to coordinate counter‑terrorism efforts among participating Muslim‑majority states. Leadership positions in such coalitions are often political appointments that reflect diplomatic relationships among member states as much as operational qualifications.
- Regional and Indian policy implications:
  - The appointment of a senior Pakistani military figure to lead a Saudi‑led coalition carries symbolic and practical weight in South Asia and the broader Muslim world. For India’s strategic community, such appointments are observed for signals about Saudi–Pakistan ties, the coalition’s priorities, and the degree to which external states (including Pakistan) are shaping regional counter‑terrorism agendas.
  - India’s own strategic culture—shaped by non‑alignment tendencies, concern for multilateral legitimacy, and sensitivity to regional power plays—will interpret IMCTC leadership choices through lenses of credibility, regional balance, and the coalition’s stated versus actual objectives. India was not a member of the IMCTC; therefore, leadership composition is relevant mainly as context for diplomacy, intelligence-sharing opportunities, and reputational effects.
  - Practical cooperation prospects can be affected by who leads a coalition: a commander with strong bilateral ties to certain capitals may accelerate cooperation with those states while complicating outreach to others. This dynamic is consequential when assessing the IMCTC’s potential utility to India or to partners seeking a broad, inclusive counter‑terrorism framework.

Research and verification guidance
- Verify current commander and any subsequent changes via:
  - Official IMCTC statements or website updates;
  - Press releases from member governments (notably Saudi Arabia and Pakistan);
  - Reputable international media and defense‑policy outlets.
- Use alternate spellings of the commander’s name when searching to avoid missing sources.
- Seek additional institutional details absent from the table (appointing authority, mandate, term limits, reporting lines) to assess the office’s formal powers and to situate any commander’s influence within the coalition’s legal and bureaucratic framework.

Concluding note
The sparse table entry—one name, a start date, and “Incumbent”—is a starting point, not a full account. For rigorous analysis of the IMCTC’s leadership and its implications for India’s national security calculations, researchers should combine verification of incumbency and biographical detail with inquiry into the coalition’s institutional design and the geopolitical relationships that underlie leadership choices.

## Reactions to the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC)

Overview  
Announced in 2015 as a Saudi-led, predominantly Muslim-state initiative against violent extremism, the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition (IMCTC) elicited a spectrum of international responses. Reactions ranged from formal endorsements and cautious openness to explicit refusals of military engagement; a small number of endorsements came from extrastate or sectarian actors. Examining these reactions reveals both the political calculus that states apply to new security initiatives and the limits of coalitions whose membership and objectives intersect with regional rivalries.

State and non‑state responses

- Bangladesh  
  Bangladesh joined the IMCTC early (15 December 2015) and publicly endorsed the coalition’s stated duty to protect the Islamic community from terrorist groups. At the same time Dhaka made clear it would not provide military support—demonstrating a pattern of symbolic political alignment without operational commitment.

- China  
  Beijing praised the Saudi effort and signalled willingness to cooperate in counterterrorism. China’s response was pragmatic: supporting counter‑extremism that could align with Chinese domestic security priorities (notably Xinjiang) while preserving bilateral ties with Saudi Arabia.

- Egypt (Al‑Azhar University)  
  The prestigious Sunni religious institution Al‑Azhar described the alliance’s formation as “historic.” This amounted to a religious‑institution endorsement that bolstered the coalition’s legitimacy within parts of the Muslim world, without implying a state military contribution from Egypt.

- Germany  
  Berlin welcomed the concept but urged the IMCTC be situated within broader, inclusive diplomatic processes—most notably the Vienna talks on Syria—which involve major powers and regional actors (the United States, Europe, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China). Germany’s framing emphasised multilateralism and the risks of exclusionary initiatives.

- Malaysia  
  Kuala Lumpur offered political support for the fight against terrorism but explicitly ruled out sending troops. Malaysia’s reaction mirrored other Muslim‑majority countries that preferred non‑military forms of participation.

- Pakistan  
  Islamabad’s initial reaction was ambiguous; it subsequently welcomed the initiative but stated it would await operational details before deciding on the extent of its participation. Pakistan’s caution reflected a need to balance relationships with Saudi Arabia, Iran, and domestic political sensitivities.

- Turkey  
  Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu framed the coalition as an appropriate response to attempts to associate terrorism with Islam—a defensive, reputational argument aimed at protecting the faith’s image as well as demonstrating political solidarity with Saudi policy.

- United States  
  Washington welcomed the IMCTC in principle. Defense officials noted the coalition aligned with U.S. interests in increasing Sunni Arab engagement against ISIS/ISIL, but also emphasised the need for more information and expressed caution about a Saudi‑only operational bloc.

- Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order (Izzat Ibrahim al‑Douri)  
  The veteran Baʿathist and insurgent leader Izzat Ibrahim al‑Douri—speaking for a militia network—praised the alliance and urged fighters to confront Shia militias in Iraq backed by Iran. This endorsement was sectarian in tone and extrastate in origin, and it stood apart from mainstream diplomatic reactions.

Analytical observations

1. Predominance of political support over operational commitment  
   Many states gave rhetorical or political support but explicitly avoided committing troops. This pattern reflects domestic political constraints, risk aversion about involvement in regional conflicts, and scepticism about the coalition’s command and legal frameworks.

2. Pragmatism and strategic balancing  
   China’s positive but guarded response exemplifies pragmatic alignment on counterterrorism without broader security entanglement. Pakistan’s hesitancy underscores the balancing act between competing regional patrons and internal politics.

3. Concerns about inclusivity and duplication  
   Germany’s insistence on integrating the IMCTC into wider diplomatic processes highlights concerns that a Saudi‑led military coalition could duplicate ongoing efforts, exclude key actors (notably Iran), and complicate conflict resolution frameworks—especially in Syria and Iraq.

4. Sectarian risk and extrastate voices  
   The Naqshbandi endorsement introduced explicit sectarian rhetoric into the discourse, feeding criticism that the coalition—though pitched as Islamic and anti‑terrorist—could exacerbate Sunni‑Shia polarization if not carefully managed and strictly restrained to law‑enforcement and counterterrorism law paradigms.

5. Practical effectiveness uncertain  
   Established principles for effective counterterrorism emphasise intelligence‑sharing, law enforcement cooperation, capacity building, and multilateral legitimacy. The IMCTC’s opaque command structures, unclear legal authorities for cross‑border operations, and potential overlap with existing coalitions left its practical impact uncertain.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy

- Preference for inclusive multilateralism  
  India’s strategic culture traditionally favours broad, inclusive frameworks that preserve diplomatic space and avoid exacerbating sectarian tensions. The German critique of exclusivity and the coalition’s potential to sideline key regional actors resonate with India’s longstanding preference for multilateral approaches.

- Caution about military coalitions with sectarian overtones  
  Given India’s own pluralist domestic politics and its relationships across West Asia (including with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Gulf States), New Delhi would likely view a Saudi‑led, Muslim‑majority military bloc with caution—supporting counterterrorism cooperation but avoiding entanglement in military coalitions that risk being perceived as sectarian or zero‑sum.

- Opportunity for law enforcement and capacity building cooperation  
  India can extract constructive elements—intelligence sharing, judicial cooperation, capacity building—that do not require direct military involvement. Engaging in these areas aligns with India’s emphasis on non‑kinetic, state‑centric tools for combating terrorism.

Conclusion  
The international reactions to the IMCTC illustrate the political tightrope states walk when faced with new security architectures that are simultaneously transnational and embedded in regional rivalries. While the coalition drew notable endorsements, most were political and non‑operational; concerns about inclusivity, legal authority, and sectarian effects limited broader buy‑in. For states like India, the IMCTC’s emergence reinforced the preference for multilateral, non‑sectarian, and institutionally legitimate modes of counterterrorism cooperation—especially those that prioritise intelligence, law enforcement and capacity building over ad hoc military arrangements.
