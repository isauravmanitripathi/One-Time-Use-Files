## The European Political Community (EPC): an intergovernmental forum for a changed European security landscape

Overview
- The European Political Community (EPC) is an intergovernmental forum established to provide a high‑level, inclusive platform for political and strategic discussion about the future of Europe. It brings together states directly—rather than creating a new supranational body—and therefore operates through consultation, coordination and political statements rather than binding legislation.

Nature and purpose
- Nature: The EPC is explicitly intergovernmental. Member states interact directly and retain sovereign control of outcomes; the forum does not have (and was not designed to have) supranational competences or a standing legislative capacity.
- Purpose: Its central aim is to provide a broad space for political and strategic dialogue on Europe’s security, political cohesion and resilience across an expanded pan‑European constituency. EPC discussions are primarily political and consultative; their outputs tend to be soft‑law instruments—declarations, joint statements and political commitments—rather than binding legal acts.

Genesis and first meeting
- Origin/Timing: The EPC was created in direct response to the seismic shock of Russia’s large‑scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. European leaders judged that the crisis revealed a need for a wider, more flexible political forum able to marshal broader continental consensus and rapid political coordination.
- First meeting: The inaugural summit convened in Prague in October 2022, signalling rapid political mobilisation and the priority given by European capitals to broadened strategic dialogue.

Participants and institutional actors
- Participants: The Prague meeting was attended by leaders and representatives of 44 European countries, spanning EU members and a wide range of non‑EU states. This breadth is central to the EPC’s rationale: enabling conversation and coordination across different European policy circles and security perspectives.
- EU involvement: The European Union participates in the EPC. It is represented by the Presidents of the European Council and of the European Commission. Their presence links the forum to EU policymaking without making the EPC an EU institution.
- Council of Europe representation: The Council of Europe also engages with the EPC; its Secretary General has been present at EPC gatherings. That participation indicates coordination and complementarity but also underscores institutional separation—EPC does not supplant the Council of Europe’s mandate on human rights, democracy and rule of law.

Relationships with existing pan‑European institutions
- Distinct from the EU: The EPC is deliberately not an EU institution. Its design emphasises inclusivity (bringing in non‑EU European states) and avoids formal duplication of EU competences. This allows wider political dialogue while preserving the EU’s legal and policy prerogatives.
- Complementary to the Council of Europe: The EPC complements rather than replaces the Council of Europe. Where the Council of Europe provides the institutional framework for human rights, democracy and rule‑of‑law standards, the EPC provides a political forum for strategic, security and cross‑sector discussions.

Operational characteristics and outputs
- Soft‑law focus: Given its intergovernmental form and absence of a binding legal framework, the EPC’s outputs are predominantly political—joint declarations, statements, shared priorities and cooperative initiatives. These can shape agendas and spur cooperative action but do not carry the enforceable legal force of treaties or EU law.
- Institutional architecture: The EPC was created quickly and with limited entrenched architecture. It lacks a comprehensive legal framework or permanent bureaucracy; its durability and practical influence will depend on repeated high‑level engagement and the political will of participants.

Strategic rationale and signaling
- Strategic rationale: The EPC was created to enhance pan‑European cooperation and solidarity in the face of a major security shock. By providing an additional venue for crisis coordination, confidence‑building and cross‑cutting policy discussion (e.g., security, energy, migration, connectivity), the EPC seeks to fill perceived gaps in existing institutional arrangements.
- Signal to external actors: The forum also functions as a diplomatic signal. Its creation communicates a desire for broader European unity and a capacity for coordinated responses, particularly in foreign and security policy arenas.

Potential benefits
- Broader inclusion: By including EU and non‑EU states, the EPC enables dialogue across European divides—helpful for confidence‑building and for addressing issues that cross institutional jurisdictions.
- Crisis coordination: It can act as a rapid, flexible political space for crisis consultation among many capitals.
- Agenda‑setting: The EPC can convene political attention around priorities that require pan‑European cooperation (energy security, critical infrastructure, migration routes, connectivity projects).

Challenges and limitations
- Overlap and duplication: There is a real risk of overlapping mandates with the EU, the Council of Europe and NATO, potentially creating confusion about roles, responsibilities and follow‑up mechanisms.
- Consensus difficulties: Reaching agreement among 44 states—each with different threat perceptions, domestic politics and priorities—can be slow and may produce lowest‑common‑denominator outcomes.
- Institutional fragility: With no entrenched legal base or permanent bureaucracy, the EPC’s long‑term influence is contingent on sustained political interest; it may struggle to convert political declarations into concrete policy implementation absent complementary institutional mechanisms.

Implications and relevance for India’s strategic outlook
- For India’s strategic community, the EPC is a useful case study in designing inclusive, high‑level forums that sit between formal institutions and ad hoc coalitions. It demonstrates both the utility and limits of intergovernmental, soft‑law mechanisms for shaping regional security politics.
- The EPC’s emphasis on political solidarity and crisis coordination is instructive for India when thinking about forums for the Indo‑Pacific: inclusive political platforms can mobilise broad coalitions quickly but require follow‑through through other institutions to deliver material outcomes.
- Finally, the EPC’s signalling function—conveying continental unity to external actors—mirrors how political forums can be used for strategic communication. India can read developments in Europe as part of the evolving global order and as indicators of how partners may coordinate on issues of mutual concern (sanctions regimes, supply‑chain security, defence cooperation).

Concluding observation
- The European Political Community is a deliberately flexible, political instrument born of crisis. It broadens the space for pan‑European conversation and sends a clear signal about continental intent. Yet its substantive impact will depend on how well it complements existing institutions, translates political commitments into action, and sustains momentum once immediate crises recede. For analysts of strategic culture and national security, the EPC offers both a model and a caution: intergovernmental inclusivity can build consensus quickly, but enduring influence requires mechanisms for implementation and institutional continuity.

### European Political Community — History

The European Political Community (EPC) is a recent and consequential addition to the architecture of European multilateralism. Conceived in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine, it was created as an informal, summit‑level political forum to enhance continental coordination on pressing geopolitical, security and resilience challenges. Below I set out the EPC’s origin, nature, initial development and the principal implications for international organisations — and conclude with suggested bearings for Indian strategic policy.

1. Origins and political genesis
- Proposal: French President Emmanuel Macron formally proposed the concept of a “European Political Community” on 9 May 2022 during the Conference on the Future of Europe. The proposal framed the EPC as a space for broad political consultation across Europe.
- EU leadership parallel: At the same time, Charles Michel, President of the European Council, championed a similar idea — a “European geopolitical community” — signalling that the initiative had both national and EU‑level sponsorship.
- Political agreement: The proposal moved quickly from idea to commitment. At the European Council meeting of 23–24 June 2022, EU leaders agreed to create the community, giving the concept rapid political legitimacy and momentum.

2. Context and drivers
- Security impetus: The EPC was explicitly a product of the strategic shock created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The war generated urgency for a wider, politically coherent European response beyond existing frameworks.
- Policy rationale: Leaders sought a forum more inclusive than the European Union but more structured than ad hoc meetings — a space for cooperative work on geopolitical questions, energy and economic resilience, migration, and coordination of political stances.

3. Nature and membership
- Informal and intergovernmental: The EPC is not a treaty organisation or a new EU body. It is an intergovernmental, summit‑style platform designed for political dialogue rather than legally binding decision‑making.
- Inclusion scope: Participation was deliberately broad. Both EU and non‑EU European states were invited, reflecting a continental rather than a strictly Union focus. The first summit convened 44 states on 6 October 2022.
- Rapid membership dynamics: The United Kingdom — post‑Brexit — announced its participation on 29 September 2022, signalling willingness to engage multilateralally on European security despite leaving the EU. San Marino joined in January 2023 as the 45th participant, and invitations extended to the heads of government of Andorra and Monaco increased the participant count to 47 by the second summit.
- Deliberate exclusions: Russia and Belarus were explicitly excluded from participation, making the EPC an instrument of geopolitical signalling as much as coordination.

4. Timeline — key dates
- 9 May 2022: Macron proposes EPC at the Conference on the Future of Europe.
- 23–24 June 2022: European Council agrees to create the EPC.
- 29 September 2022: United Kingdom announces participation.
- 6 October 2022: First summit convenes with 44 states.
- January 2023: San Marino joins (45th participating state).
- Second summit (early 2023): Andorra and Monaco invited; participant total 47.

5. Rapid operationalisation and political signalling
- Speed of creation: From proposal (May) to first summit (October) the EPC moved at exceptional political speed. This rapid operationalisation reflects high political priority among European leaders and an appetite for new mechanisms in the face of acute insecurity.
- Geopolitical message: Excluding Russia and Belarus — while inviting almost the whole rest of the continent, including post‑Brexit Britain and microstates — conveyed a clear alignment with Ukraine and a unified political stance against Russian aggression.

6. Probable agenda areas and functional remit
Although the EPC’s remit is intentionally flexible, its likely focus areas derive from the strategic environment that produced it:
- Security and defence cooperation (political coordination rather than military command);
- Energy security and diversification;
- Infrastructure resilience and supply chains;
- Migration and humanitarian coordination;
- Political coordination on sanctions, diplomacy and messaging.
The EPC is positioned as a convening table for these topics among states that otherwise sit in multiple overlapping institutional arrangements (EU, NATO, Council of Europe).

7. Institutional questions and future trajectory
The EPC’s informal character raises a set of open questions that will determine its future influence:
- Institutionalisation: Will the forum remain a summit‑level consultative body, or will it develop secretariat functions, working groups or permanent structures?
- Legal and decision‑making power: Can the EPC evolve beyond political declarations into mechanisms that shape policy or operational cooperation?
- Relationship with existing bodies: How will the EPC relate to the EU (European Council, Council of the EU), NATO, and the Council of Europe to avoid duplication and friction?
- Enlargement and access rules: What criteria will govern invitations, observerships and the role of non‑European partners?

8. Implications for international organisations
- Filling a gap: The EPC creates an intermediate tier of continental political dialogue — more inclusive than the EU, more institutionalised than episodic summits — that fills a lacuna in European governance.
- Complementarity and overlap: By convening many of the same states that participate in EU and NATO forums, the EPC may both facilitate coordination and risk redundancy. Effective role‑clearing among institutions will be necessary.
- Soft institutionalisation as strategy: The EPC exemplifies a trend in contemporary multilateralism — creating flexible, politically driven forums capable of rapid response without treaty constraints.
- Strategic signalling: The EPC is a vehicle for collective political messaging to adversaries, reinforcing deterrence through unified diplomatic posture.

9. Relevance to India — strategic takeaways and recommended posture
For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the EPC offers several useful lessons and considerations:
- Model of inclusive minilateralism: The EPC is an example of an inclusive, cross‑cutting minilateral forum that allows flexible policy coordination without formal treaty commitments. This model resonates with Indian preferences for non‑binding, consensus‑oriented mechanisms that preserve strategic autonomy.
- Engagement opportunities: While the EPC is a European construct, its focus areas (energy security, supply chains, resilience, migration) overlap with Indian strategic interests. India should monitor EPC outcomes and seek substantive engagement where mutual interests align (e.g., energy diversification, connectivity, sanctions coordination affecting global markets).
- Signalling and normative alignment: The EPC’s exclusion of Russia and Belarus and alignment with Ukraine illustrate how regional forums can function as instruments of normative positioning. India must weigh reputational and material costs when calibrating reactions to such collective stances, balancing principles (territorial sovereignty) with strategic partnerships.
- Institutional learning: India can derive lessons for South Asian and Indo‑Pacific governance — namely the value of rapid, summit‑level convening in crises and the utility of flexible forums alongside formal institutions (SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA).
- Avoiding overcommitment: Given the EPC is not treaty‑bound, India should prefer engagement that preserves strategic autonomy (e.g., targeted dialogues, sectoral cooperation), rather than formal alignments that could constrain policy space.

10. Concise summary
The European Political Community emerged rapidly in 2022 from President Macron’s proposal, backed by EU leadership, as an inclusive, informal political forum to strengthen continental coordination in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It convened its first summit in October 2022 with 44 states (explicitly excluding Russia and Belarus), expanded to include microstates and the United Kingdom, and by early 2023 counted 47 participants. The EPC exemplifies flexible multilateralism — politically potent but institutionally light — with implications for how regional powers (including India) engage with evolving European governance and how they design their own mechanisms for crisis‑driven cooperation.

## Aim

On 9 May 2022 French President Emmanuel Macron proposed the creation of a European Political Community (EPC) in an address to the European Parliament. Framed by Macron as “a new European organization,” the EPC was presented as an inclusive political platform uniting countries that subscribe to shared core European values. Its immediate pitch was practical and normative: to create a flexible space for political dialogue and operational cooperation across the continent on matters ranging from security to energy and migration.

### Genesis and immediate purpose
The EPC proposal must be read against the acute security and energy shock that followed Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. That crisis exposed gaps in rapid political coordination and energy resilience across Europe. In this context the EPC was offered as a rapid, politically credible mechanism to:

- Provide a policy‑coordination platform for European countries—EU members and non‑EU states—to deliberate and act jointly on urgent continental challenges.
- Foster political dialogue and cooperative measures on politics, security, energy, infrastructure, investment and migration.
- Strengthen security, stability and prosperity across Europe by enabling faster, broader consultation and selected collaborative projects.

The inaugural summit in Prague (October 2022) operationalized the concept by convening leaders across the continent. A subsequent UK–France joint declaration (10 March 2023) recommended concentrating EPC attention on energy, infrastructure and connectivity, cybersecurity, countering disinformation and migration—an agenda mixing hard and soft resilience measures.

### Format, membership and limits
Crucially, the EPC was designed as a flexible, non‑treaty, non‑binding forum rather than a new supranational institution. Its defining characteristics include:

- Inclusivity: open to EU member states, non‑EU European countries, candidate states and neighbours (and explicitly accommodating the post‑Brexit UK), enabling pan‑European participation without offering immediate EU accession.
- Political, not legal, modality: emphasis on voluntary cooperation and project‑based initiatives (student exchanges, university linkages, joint infrastructure planning, energy coordination), not on formal legal commitments or treaty obligations.
- Complementarity: intended to sit alongside—rather than replace—existing bodies (EU institutions, Council of Europe, OSCE), while recognizing inherent risks of mandate overlap.

This format allows rapidly convened, politically salient responses to shocks but also raises questions about governance, funding, decision‑making processes and the potential for duplicating mandates.

### Specific aims and operational fields
The EPC’s listed aims and operational priorities reveal a hybrid agenda combining security, resilience and people‑to‑people elements:

- Strengthen ties between EU members and non‑EU European states that share European values.
- Increase cooperation on peace and collective security, energy resilience, climate action, migration management and economic challenges.
- Enable candidate states to begin participating in select European projects (for example, student and university exchanges), thereby offering preparatory integration without conferring accession rights.
- Prioritized operational fields (per state declarations and summit communiqués): energy resilience and joint responses to crises; infrastructure connectivity across borders; cybersecurity cooperation and exercises; countering disinformation; migration management.

The EPC therefore combines “hard” cooperation (infrastructure, energy, cybersecurity) with “soft” initiatives (information integrity, educational exchanges).

### Benefits, risks and functional trade‑offs
Potential benefits
- Faster, informal coordination on urgent continental challenges (energy, migration, deterrence signalling).
- A diplomatic space that reduces the isolation of candidate and neighbouring states and allows them to participate in practical projects.
- A mechanism for the UK to engage broadly with European partners after Brexit, reinforcing security and economic links without institutional reintegration.

Risks and limitations
- Duplication and role confusion vis‑à‑vis the EU, Council of Europe and OSCE—especially where mandates and project portfolios overlap.
- Limited enforcement capacity: the EPC’s non‑binding nature makes implementation dependent on national political will and pre‑existing bilateral or multilateral instruments.
- Diplomatic sensitivity over invitations and exclusions: decisions about membership and participation have geopolitical consequences and can provoke contestation.
- Ambiguity around governance and funding: lack of clarity about secretariat functions, decision modalities and who pays undermines predictability and long‑term viability.

### Relation to EU enlargement and long‑term governance
The EPC was explicitly not designed as a substitute for EU accession. Instead it offers preparatory and complementary integration opportunities:

- For candidate states, the EPC can provide practical engagement and capacity‑building that may accelerate certain functional alignments (e.g., regulatory cooperation, academic exchanges), while falling short of the legal and institutional commitments that EU membership entails.
- Over the longer term, the EPC could influence the architecture of European governance in two divergent ways: it might facilitate accession by building trust and interoperability, or it could institutionalize a parallel cooperative track that reduces incentives for formal enlargement. Which path prevails depends on governance choices, the concrete deliverables produced, and how EU institutions respond.

### Strategic and policy implications (short to long term)
- Short term: the EPC enables faster, informal coordination on urgent continental issues—most notably energy security and migration—allowing states to act collectively without awaiting treaty processes.
- Medium term: sustained engagement through the EPC can deepen political ties between EU and non‑EU states, mitigating regional isolation and strengthening networks of resilience.
- Long term: the EPC has the potential to reshape European cooperation by creating a flexible forum that complements or competes with existing institutions; it also serves as strategic signalling that Europe intends broad, coordinated responses to geopolitical shocks and will include non‑EU partners where useful.

### Stakeholders
Primary stakeholders include:
- EU institutions and EU member states (whose policy coherence and subsidiarity concerns are central).
- Non‑EU European countries, including candidate states and neighbours.
- Leading proposers and agenda‑shapers (France, the Czech Republic, the UK as an important external participant).
- National ministries responsible for energy, security, migration and foreign policy.
- Civil society, universities and exchange programmes participating in people‑to‑people initiatives.
- The private sector (energy firms, infrastructure developers, cybersecurity firms) as implementers and partners.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For a reader focused on India, the EPC offers several transferable lessons and points of strategic interest:

- Forums that are political and flexible, rather than treaty‑bound, can be effective instruments for crisis coordination and for convening diverse partners rapidly—an approach India already uses in many of its regional initiatives.
- The EPC’s inclusion of non‑members and candidate states illustrates a model for enhancing strategic connectivity without immediate institutional commitments—relevant for India’s engagement with neighbouring countries and regional partnerships.
- The emphasis on energy resilience, cybersecurity and counter‑disinformation parallels Indian national security priorities; multilateral platforms that mix hard infrastructure cooperation with soft‑power exchanges can strengthen resilience in contested strategic environments.
- The governance ambiguities and duplication risks underline the importance of clear mandates, funding and institutional delineation—lessons India can apply in designing its own regional mechanisms or when joining external formats.

### Recommended follow‑up and monitoring
To assess the EPC’s durability and utility, observers should track:

- Governance architecture: how decision‑making, secretariat support and funding are structured over time.
- Overlap mapping: systematic comparison of EPC agendas with EU, Council of Europe and OSCE activities to identify duplication or complementarities.
- Concrete deliverables: prioritization and monitoring of measurable projects (cross‑border infrastructure links, joint energy procurement or storage initiatives, cybersecurity exercises, exchange programmes).
- Inclusion and invitation criteria: how participation is decided and the geopolitical consequences of inclusion/exclusion.
- Impact on enlargement: whether EPC participation yields tangible advances in candidate states’ policy alignment or remains symbolic.
- UK engagement: the extent and nature of post‑Brexit UK leverage and use of the EPC as a European engagement platform.

Conclusion
The EPC illustrates a contemporary approach to regional governance: politically salient, flexible, and project‑oriented rather than legally integrated. For European actors it offers rapid coordination and inclusion; for external observers and practitioners—India included—it provides a useful case study in balancing inclusivity, operational ambition and institutional clarity when designing multilateral initiatives in a volatile security environment.

## The European Political Community (EPC): Form, Early Evolution, and Lessons for Strategic Engagement

Background and purpose
- The European Political Community (EPC) was conceived as an intergovernmental forum for heads of state and government, modelled on high-level formats such as the G7 and G20. Its intent is to provide a compact platform for political dialogue across Europe on security, energy, migration and other strategic issues, without creating a new treaty-based organisation.
- From inception the EPC emphasised flexibility and speed of convening rather than institutional permanence. This design choice signals an emphasis on elite political dialogue and peer-level exchange rather than legally binding commitments or an administrative bureaucracy.

Institutional design and early organisational practice
- No permanent secretariat, core budget, or standing staff were established at the EPC’s creation. Summits and related activities have relied principally on ad hoc and host-driven organisation.
- Each summit is primarily organised by the hosting country, with summit preparation, logistics and agenda-setting dependent on the capacity and choices of that host.
- Public materials — agendas, press releases and multimedia — have not been published on a standalone EPC website. Instead, summit documentation has been posted on the European Council’s website, aligning EPC communications with existing EU channels.

Coordination mechanism: trio to quartet
- To provide short-term continuity across summit cycles, the EPC initially used a hosting “trio” for coordination: the incoming host, the outgoing host and the future host. The trio helped align agendas and smooth transitions but remained an informal mechanism with limited institutional weight.
- After the fourth summit (July 2024) the coordination mechanism was expanded from a trio to a quartet. This formal expansion indicates a recognition of transition risk between hosts and a desire for broader continuity or inclusion of additional stakeholders in planning. Whether a quartet improves strategic planning depends on whether roles and decision-making procedures are made clearer in practice.

Partial institutionalisation: France’s January 2023 task force
- In January 2023 France created a small task force, led by a dedicated project manager, to support EPC work. The task force’s remit included:
  - coordinating preparation and organisation of EPC summits;
  - supporting the EPC’s evolving institutional development;
  - integrating the EPC into the wider European diplomatic space (notably the EU and the Council of Europe); and
  - mobilising external actors (for example, development banks) to give political commitments operational financing.
- The French initiative illustrates a form of “distributed institutionalisation”: rather than creating a central European bureaucracy, national administrations provide ad hoc, specialised capacity to support a multilateral forum. If other states replicate this approach, the accumulation of national task forces could functionally create distributed institutional memory and capacity.

Signals of hybrid sponsorship and communications choices
- Invitation practice has underscored the EPC’s hybrid status between EU-level endorsement and host ownership: the first summit’s invitations were signed by European Council President Charles Michel; for the second summit invitations were jointly signed by Charles Michel and the hosting country’s president (Maia Sandu).
- Reliance on the European Council’s web channels for publishing EPC materials helps with reach and administrative convenience but risks blurring the EPC’s independent identity in the public domain and limiting visibility for non-EU participants.

Analytical insights: strengths and trade-offs of the EPC model
- G7/G20 analogy: the EPC is structured as a high-level political forum rather than a treaty-based organisation. That format promotes rapid consensus-building and political signalling among leaders, and minimises costs and legal complexity.
- Flexibility versus continuity: the absence of a secretariat or budget makes the EPC low-cost and adaptable, but it creates dependence on host states and other institutions for operational continuity and institutional memory.
- Informality and follow-through: informality enables nimble diplomacy but may hinder the development of enforceable outcomes, robust monitoring, and sustained project implementation.
- Integration with EU structures: formal and informal linkages with EU institutions and the Council of Europe can produce useful complementarities and avert duplication, but excessive association with the EU risks perceptions of bias among non-EU participants.
- Move toward operationalisation: engagement with development banks and other external actors points to an intent to convert summit-level commitments into financed projects — a critical test of the EPC’s capacity to generate concrete outcomes beyond declarations.

Implications and risks
- Institutional memory and continuity are fragile without a permanent secretariat; ad hoc arrangements (hosting trio/quartet, national task forces) may prove uneven and episodic.
- Informal design limits the EPC’s ability to create binding instruments, perform systematic monitoring or guarantee financing for initiatives.
- Host-dependence can produce variability in summit quality, thematic focus and external engagement, complicating strategic predictability.
- Close linkage to EU structures may be politically sensitive for participants wary of EU influence, potentially undermining the EPC’s perceived neutrality.
- Expansion of the hosting coordination to a quartet may either complicate decision-making or provide greater stability — the outcome will hinge on how responsibilities are allocated in practice.

Practical recommendations for observation and follow-up
- Track whether the EPC evolves toward a formal secretariat, a core budget or permanent staff; if such institutionalisation occurs, monitor financing modalities and member-state influence.
- Observe the operationalisation of the quartet: its membership, mandate, decision-making rules and how it differs from the earlier trio model.
- Follow outputs from France’s task force and note whether other countries create analogous support units; an accumulation of national task forces could create a de facto distributed secretariat.
- Assess coordination mechanisms with the EU and the Council of Europe to ensure role clarity and avoid institutional duplication.
- Watch for formal partnerships with development banks and implementation mechanisms that can translate political declarations into financed projects.
- Recommend that the EPC establish a dedicated communications platform (a website and archival repository) to enhance transparency, continuity and a distinct institutional identity.

Relevance and lessons for India’s strategic culture and policy outlook
- Observational value: for Indian policymakers and analysts, the EPC demonstrates a contemporary model of flexible, summit-centred multilateralism that combines elite political dialogue with selective functionalisation (e.g., pulling in finance actors to implement projects). It is worth observing as a template of low-cost convening that can nevertheless aspire to operational outcomes.
- Engagement calculus: while India is not an EPC participant, the forum’s attempt to bridge political dialogue and financing mechanisms is relevant for India’s partnerships with European states. India should monitor EPC initiatives that intersect with areas of Indian interest (energy security, infrastructure, regional stability), since development banks or bilateral partners involved via the EPC might offer opportunities for collaboration.
- Institutional choice and strategic trade-offs: the EPC illustrates the trade-off between institutional permanence (secretariat, budget) and flexibility. India’s own regional initiatives — whether in the neighbourhood, the Indo-Pacific, or in formats such as the Quad — can draw lessons on whether to prefer lightweight, leader-led formats or invest in standing institutional capacities to ensure continuity and implementation.
- Distributed institutional capacity as a model: the French task force and ad hoc national support units suggest an alternative to centralized secretariats: states can build specialised national capacities to sustain multilateral agendas. India could adopt a similar posture when hosting or leading regional initiatives, institutionalising a small, dedicated national team to guarantee continuity without creating expensive supranational bodies.
- Communication and identity management: the EPC’s reliance on EU channels shows the importance of an independent communication identity for a forum. India’s diplomatic initiatives should ensure clear public-facing platforms to preserve autonomy, visibility and consistent archiving of commitments.

Conclusion
The EPC is an instructive case of 21st-century, summit-centred multilateralism: designed for agility and leader-level political exchange, deliberately light on permanent structures, yet gradually accruing ad hoc institutional supports. For India, the EPC provides both a model to observe and a set of lessons on institutional design, continuity mechanisms, and the politics of engagement with regional groupings. The key questions going forward will be whether the EPC maintains its light footprint or shifts toward greater institutionalisation — and how such a trajectory affects its capacity to turn high-level political commitments into funded, sustained action.

### Visual identity and political sensitivity: the European Political Community (EPC)

This short case study examines how visual identity — something often treated as mere design — becomes a site of political negotiation in new multilateral forums. The EPC’s early choices about its symbols illustrate how branding decisions encode questions of legitimacy, membership, and institutional distinctiveness, and how these considerations are consequential for states concerned with sovereignty and strategic positioning.

Summary of the facts
- Since the EPC’s first summit (October 2022) the forum has used a full wordmark: the English name “European Political Community” in blue capital letters for formal and descriptive contexts.  
- Ahead of the second summit a compact, abbreviated logo — “EPC” in blue on white — was introduced for media, signage and constrained formats.  
- The United Kingdom’s continued participation was made conditional, politically, by then‑Prime Minister Liz Truss, who requested that the EPC avoid symbols explicitly associated with the European Union (notably the European Flag and the European Anthem). Her brief tenure as prime minister places this requirement at an early, formative moment in the EPC’s identity choices.

Why these choices matter
- Distinction from the EU: Avoiding the European Flag (blue field with 12 gold stars) and the European Anthem (Beethoven’s Ode to Joy) was intended to prevent conflation between the EPC and the EU. This helped present the EPC as a distinct, intergovernmental forum rather than an EU institution.  
- Inclusivity and sovereignty reassurance: Neutral visual identity reassures non‑EU participants — notably the UK — that participation will not imply institutional absorption into the EU or signal diminished sovereignty. Symbolic neutrality therefore functions as a political safeguard.  
- Practical communications needs: The full wordmark serves official and legal uses where descriptive clarity is needed; the abbreviated “EPC” logo is pragmatic for signage, social media, and other constrained formats. These operational distinctions mirror the political trade‑offs the designers navigated.

Design choices are political choices
- The UK condition demonstrates how apparently minor visual elements can carry substantive diplomatic weight. Branding is, in effect, a negotiated policy outcome: flags, anthems, and emblems are not merely decorative but communicate institutional authority and membership.  
- Even when overt EU symbols are avoided, the EPC’s use of blue-on-white signals a broadly “European” palette. This illustrates a common diplomatic tactic: retain familiar visual cues that confer immediacy and professionalism while stripping out explicit institutional references that could be politically objectionable.

Further implications and likely dynamics going forward
- Negotiated evolution: As the EPC matures, further elements of identity (flag variants, emblems, stationery templates) will likely be subject to political negotiation. Prominent participants — especially those who conditioned their involvement — can exercise de facto veto power over symbolic choices.  
- Effects on legitimacy and membership politics: Symbol choices affect external perceptions of the forum’s purpose and its relation to other institutions, which can influence member engagement, third‑party support, and regional dynamics.  
- Communications best practice for multilateral bodies: maintain clear messaging on purpose and independence; ensure visual identity is scalable and legible; and anticipate that aesthetic choices will be interpreted politically.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security communications
- Sensitivity to symbols: The EPC case offers a wider lesson for India’s approach to international forums. India’s strategic culture, with its emphasis on sovereignty and strategic autonomy, makes it acutely aware that symbols and terminology can imply alignments or constraints. India therefore tends to favour neutral, descriptive institutional language and carefully calibrated visual cues when participating in or shaping multilateral initiatives.  
- Projecting independence while ensuring familiarity: Like the EPC’s use of blue to evoke a European frame without invoking EU emblems, India can deploy design and language that are professional and familiar to international audiences while avoiding iconography that suggests subordination to another power bloc.  
- Operationalizing diplomatic preferences: Just as the EPC adopted two complementary marks for different functions, India’s foreign and security communications benefit from a dual approach — formal nomenclature and documentation for legal clarity, and compact, media‑friendly identifiers for public diplomacy and operational use.  
- Anticipating negotiation: When India engages in institution‑building or forum participation, it should expect symbolic and branding issues to become bargaining chips. Preparing principled, practicable alternatives in advance (neutral color palettes, descriptive wordmarks, abbreviated acronyms) reduces friction and preserves strategic objectives.

Concluding observation
The EPC’s early branding choices underscore that visual identity is a tool of diplomacy as much as design. For states attentive to sovereignty and position — including India — attention to symbols, their political implications, and the operational needs of communications should be integral to strategy when entering or shaping multilateral arrangements.

Section: The European Political Community — Institutional Rhythm, Hosting Practice, and Lessons for India

Introduction and overview
- The European Political Community (EPC) has rapidly institutionalized a biannual summit rhythm: a spring meeting hosted by a non‑EU state and an autumn meeting hosted by the EU member state holding the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union that semester. This hosting convention embeds the EPC in the EU calendar while deliberately opening space for non‑EU states to exercise agenda influence and visibility.
- The EPC’s inaugural summit was convened at Prague Castle on 6 October 2022 and was broadcast live via the Eurovision network—an early sign that the format seeks public visibility as well as diplomatic resonance. Early outcomes emphasised practical security priorities, notably protection of cross‑border infrastructure (energy pipelines, subsea cables, satellite assets), positioning the EPC as a forum bridging normative political dialogue and practical transnational security cooperation.

Chronology of summits (concise tabulation)
- A succinct record of the first seven summits and announced hosts through 2028 shows rapid scheduling and forward planning. Attendance has been high but not uniform (42–45 states), and several future chairs/attendance figures remain TBA.

Key themes and institutional features
- Institutional rhythm and EU embedding: Linking the autumn summit to the rotating EU Council presidency gives the EPC predictability and draws administrative support from EU institutions. It also symbolically ties the EPC to EU mechanisms without making it an exclusively EU‑centric forum.
- Outreach and inclusiveness: By reserving spring hosting for non‑EU states, the EPC creates a built‑in outward orientation. Non‑EU hosts (e.g., Moldova, Albania, Armenia) gain platform power to shape agendas and generate diplomatic capital.
- Security pragmatism: Early collective priorities—especially the protection of pipelines, undersea cables and satellites—signal the EPC’s niche: operational, transnational security issues that fall between NATO/European defence structures and broader pan‑European diplomatic forums.
- Soft‑power signalling: The choice of symbolic venues (castles, the Alhambra, national arenas) and live Eurovision broadcasts indicate a deliberate effort to project legitimacy, narrative control and public visibility.
- Forward planning and continuity: Public announcements of hosts several years ahead (e.g., schedule through 2028) demonstrate an emphasis on continuity and predictable institutional life‑cycles.

Observations, implications and analytical notes
- Hosting as power and platform: The spring hosting convention materially raises the profile of non‑EU states and allows them to practice agenda setting—this is a low‑cost but high‑visibility instrument of foreign policy. For non‑EU aspirants and neutral states (e.g., Moldova, Switzerland, Serbia), hosting interest reflects the EPC’s attractiveness as a theatre for diplomatic projection.
- Variable attendance as an indicator: Fluctuations in attendance (42–45) are analytically meaningful. They may reveal political absences, competing diplomatic calendars, or deliberate selective engagement; tracking these patterns yields insight into which countries treat the EPC as essential versus optional.
- Functional niche between institutions: The EPC’s focus on concrete infrastructure security exemplifies how new formats can carve operational niches—providing convening authority on issues that are transnational but not strictly military, and where EU or NATO mandates may be limited or politically sensitive.
- Media and legitimacy: Eurovision coverage underscores the EPC’s ambition to translate elite diplomacy into public legitimacy. Visibility through public broadcasting enhances domestic political payoffs for hosts and signals to audiences across Europe (and beyond) the EPC’s salience.

Data gaps and uncertainties (research caveats)
- Missing procedural instruments: The public record, as summarised here, lacks a consolidated EPC charter or terms of reference that clarify formal hosting procedures, decision‑making rules, and invitation criteria.
- Participation lists and criteria: There is no granular public list in the summary indicating which states attended each summit, which constrains analysis of patterns of engagement (consistent participants, absentees, observers).
- Outcomes vs. implementation: Beyond general statements on infrastructure protection, the table does not reveal follow‑through mechanisms or binding commitments; it is unclear how summit declarations are translated into operational cooperation.
- Reasons for attendance variance: Causes behind attendance fluctuation are not documented publicly in the summary—these could include scheduling conflicts, bilateral disputes, or strategic signalling through non‑attendance.

Recommendations for follow‑up (for scholars and policymakers, especially in India)
- Obtain institutional documents: Secure the EPC’s formal terms of reference, and any memoranda on hosting procedures and invitation lists, to understand its legal‑political architecture.
- Compile participant rosters: Build a state‑by‑state attendance database across summits to map engagement patterns, identify absentees, and correlate attendance with political events.
- Track communiqués and implementation: Analyse summit communiqués alongside subsequent national or multilateral actions to assess whether EPC statements become operational cooperation (e.g., joint investment in infrastructure resilience).
- Observe symbolic politics: Monitor venue selection, media coverage and host speeches for diplomatic signalling—these provide insight into how hosts use the EPC to shape narratives.
- Cross‑reference calendars: To explain attendance variability, cross‑check summit dates with other major international meetings and regional crises.

Relevance and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Platform diplomacy and regional institution‑building: The EPC exemplifies how a light institutional framework, backed by predictable cadence and high‑level participation, can create a useful platform for practical cooperation without the overhead of treaty obligations. India—pursuing normative leadership in the Indo‑Pacific and seeking formats to promote infrastructure resilience (digital, energy, maritime)—can draw lessons on using regular, high‑visibility summits to convene diverse partners for specific, actionable workstreams.
- Hosting as strategic instrument: The practice of allocating hosting to non‑members to widen outreach suggests a model for India’s neighbourhood diplomacy: hosting multilateral meetings provides outsized diplomatic returns (agenda control, public messaging) at manageable cost.
- Infrastructure security as cooperation area: The EPC’s early emphasis on pipelines, undersea cables and satellite protection resonates with India’s own concerns about critical infrastructure vulnerability. India could employ similar multilateral architectures (or bilateral workstreams within existing institutions) to mobilise partners for resilience measures, technical cooperation, and norms on critical infrastructure protection.
- Neutral/aspirant state inclusion: Switzerland’s and Serbia’s interest in hosting demonstrates how neutral or candidate states use such forums for visibility. India’s engagements with neutral partners (e.g., Switzerland) and regional aspirants could be leveraged through hosting and participation in multilateral formats tailored to practical security challenges.
- Institutional embedding with flexibility: The EPC’s hybrid embedding in the EU calendar while preserving outreach to non‑members illustrates how institutions can balance anchoring and inclusiveness. India, when designing regional convening mechanisms, might similarly tether new formats to existing institutional rhythms (e.g., ASEAN, G20) while opening them to wider partners to maximise both administrative support and diplomatic reach.

Concluding remark
The EPC is a compact case of contemporary multilateral innovation: rapid institutionalisation, pragmatic security focus, and deliberate use of hosting and media to build legitimacy. For India’s strategic community, the EPC yields concrete lessons on how predictable convening, use of hosting as a policy instrument, and prioritising cross‑border infrastructure resilience can be combined to produce practical multilateral outcomes without requiring heavy treaty architectures. Further empirical work—participant lists, formal texts and post‑summit follow‑through—will be necessary to assess whether the EPC’s declaratory ambitions convert into sustained operational cooperation.

## The European Political Community (EPC): Composition, Purpose and Lessons for Indian Strategic Policy

The European Political Community (EPC) emerged in 2022 as a high‑level, political forum intended to foster pan‑European dialogue on security, energy, migration, connectivity and post‑crisis recovery. It is not a treaty‑based organisation with binding instruments; rather, it is a flexible summitry platform that brings together a wide range of European states and regional organisations. The EPC’s composition and operating choices—who is included, who is excluded, and which institutions accompany national delegations—offer a compact case study in multilateral design and diplomatic balancing that carries practical lessons for India’s strategic culture and external policy.

### Participating states (by status)
The EPC deliberately spans the EU and non‑EU European space. Participants in EPC summits have included the full array below (country name followed by status designation):

- EU members: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden
- Former EU member: United Kingdom (Brexit)
- EU candidates and hopefuls: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (potential candidate), Moldova (candidate status granted 2022), Montenegro (candidate), North Macedonia (candidate), Serbia (candidate), Turkey (candidate; accession talks largely stalled), Ukraine (candidate granted 2022)
- Non‑EU Eastern Partnership / South Caucasus states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia
- EFTA / EEA / EFTA‑adjacent states: Iceland, Liechtenstein (EFTA/EEA members), Norway (EFTA/EEA), Switzerland (EFTA)
- Microstates / non‑EU European states: Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, Malta (EU microstate)
- Partially recognized entity: Kosovo (partial recognition; not UN member; its status is diplomatically sensitive)

This mix underscores the EPC’s ambition to be inclusive of the continent’s different constitutional and integration statuses—from fully integrated EU members to microstates, EFTA countries, candidate countries and partially recognized entities.

### Participating organisations and their roles
The EPC also includes pan‑European organisations that bring institutional and functional capacity into the dialogue:

- European Union (represented collectively through its main institutions)
  - European Council: the body of heads of state and government—carries political direction and represents member states collectively.
  - European Commission: the EU executive—contributes policy proposals and implementation perspectives.
  - European Parliament: the EU legislature—provides a democratic legitimacy and normative voice in discussions.
- Council of Europe: the European human‑rights and rule‑of‑law organisation—distinguishes the EPC’s normative dimension from purely interstate bargaining.
- NATO: the transatlantic security alliance—signals a security and defence dimension to EPC consultations.
- OSCE: the Euro‑Atlantic organisation for politico‑military confidence‑building and human rights—adds mechanisms and experience in crisis management and regional security cooperation.

The participation of both EU institutions and security organisations demonstrates that the EPC is designed to handle political, normative and security‑related issues in parallel.

### Not participating / not invited
- Not participating: Vatican City — a sovereign city‑state which often maintains a distinct, neutral diplomatic posture and was not included on EPC participation lists.
- Not invited: Belarus and Russia — both explicitly excluded. Belarus’s authoritarian orientation and close ties to Russia, and Russia’s central role in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, explain their omission. This exclusion is a deliberate geopolitical choice that defines the EPC’s orientation.

### Key observations on the EPC’s design and practice
- Inclusivity across statuses: The EPC brings together EU members, candidate states, microstates, EFTA/EEA countries and partially recognized entities. This breadth contrasts with EU‑only forums and facilitates cross‑cutting, Europe‑wide conversations.
- Collective EU participation: The simultaneous participation of the European Council, Commission and Parliament allows the EU to speak with institutional coherence while its member states retain individual representation.
- Security organisations present: NATO and OSCE involvement signals that the EPC is as much a security‑political forum as it is an economic or connectivity forum—crisis management and defence coordination are on the table.
- Geopolitical delimitation: Excluding Russia and Belarus converts the EPC from an all‑Europe dialogue mechanism into a Western‑oriented, security‑aligned platform—an important strategic decision that shapes what can be discussed and with whom.
- Diplomatic balancing: Inclusion of both Serbia and Kosovo shows the EPC’s capacity to host actors with sensitive bilateral disputes in a multilateral setting—allowing dialogue without resolving recognition issues.
- Distinction from treaty organisations: The EPC’s summitary, political nature means participation does not entail legal obligations or membership rights; it is a space for coordination and signalling, not binding commitments.

### Implications and relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For Indian scholars and policymakers, the EPC is instructive in several respects:

- Designing inclusive, flexible forums: EPC shows how to construct political spaces that include states with divergent integration statuses and recognition issues—useful for India when convening regional platforms in the Indo‑Pacific that may need to engage major powers, middle powers and small island states concurrently.
- Leveraging institutional and state‑level representation: The model of combining supranational institutions (EU bodies) with member states provides a template for how collective institutions can be involved alongside national delegations to project unified policy while preserving bilateral ties. India can consider similar dual tracks when engaging multilateral development banks, regional bodies or coalition groupings.
- Security dimension in political forums: The explicit inclusion of security organisations (NATO, OSCE) demonstrates the value—and risks—of linking political dialogue to defence coordination. For India, deliberate choices are required about whether to institutionalise security partners inside political fora or to keep security cooperation in specialised channels.
- Managing exclusions and normative signalling: The decision to exclude Russia and Belarus was a normative and strategic signal. India’s strategic culture—balancing autonomy, strategic partnerships and normative positions—can draw lessons on how exclusion or inclusion signals align with national interests and broader coalition‑building.
- Handling sensitive bilateral disputes in multilateral contexts: EPC’s accommodation of Serbia and Kosovo within the same forum illustrates how multilateral platforms can be used to preserve dialogue and manage tensions without forcing premature bilateral settlements—a technique India can apply in South Asian or maritime disputes.
- Limits of political forums: The EPC’s lack of binding instruments highlights that political convening is useful for coordination and signalling but less effective for enforceable guarantees. India should calibrate expectations when using summitary mechanisms to pursue security guarantees or economic interdependence.

### Recommendations for further monitoring (operational guidance)
To assess how the EPC’s evolution may matter to India’s strategic calculations, monitor the following:

- Summit declarations and joint communiqués for stated priorities, operational initiatives and references to security cooperation or connectivity projects.
- Changes to the participant list or invitations as indicators of shifting geopolitical alignments (e.g., potential future engagement with excluded actors or deeper institutionalization).
- How EU institutions use EPC outcomes to shape EU external policy, enlargement narratives and funding flows for candidate states—this affects regional dynamics in which India may have interests.
- NATO and OSCE engagement patterns at EPC events to detect new crisis‑response mechanisms or cooperative formats relevant to European security architectures.
- Specific outcomes for candidate countries (Ukraine, Moldova, Western Balkans) to evaluate practical support trajectories and the implications for regional stability.

Conclusion
The EPC is a deliberately wide‑ranging, politically oriented forum that reflects contemporary European attempts to combine inclusivity with a particular geopolitical orientation. For Indian strategic culture—characterized by careful balancing, institutional pragmatism and an emphasis on sovereignty—the EPC offers concrete lessons on forum design, the interplay of institutions and states, and the trade‑offs implicit in inclusion versus exclusion. Observing the EPC’s development furnishes India with comparative experience for crafting its own multilateral engagements in the Indo‑Pacific and beyond.

## Achievements of the European Political Community Summits: operationalising multilateral dialogue

This section examines the concrete outputs of the inaugural European Political Community (EPC) summits. Although the EPC is a distinct European multilateral initiative, its capacity to translate high-level political dialogue into short-term operations, funding commitments and institutional follow‑up offers instructive comparisons for Indian strategic planning—particularly for how inclusive political forums can be harnessed to produce tangible security and resilience outcomes.

### 1. The Armenia initiative: short-term monitoring to longer-term mission

- First summit decision: leaders agreed to deploy an EU‑led monitoring mission on the Armenian side of the Armenia–Azerbaijan border. The mission was explicitly designed as a two‑month monitoring exercise in the immediate aftermath of a border crisis.
- Operational details: the deployment took place on Armenia’s side, with a narrowly defined monitoring role and a short‑term mandate focused on de‑escalation and confidence‑building.
- Outcome and institutionalisation: the short monitoring mission served as a probe that identified continuing needs for stabilisation and capacity‑building. It thus paved the way for the establishment of the European Union Mission in Armenia (EUMA), a longer‑term presence to monitor the border, reduce tensions and assist confidence‑building after repeated clashes linked to the post‑2020 Nagorno‑Karabakh environment.
- Contextual note: the Armenia–Azerbaijan clashes must be read against long‑standing territorial disputes that intensified after the 2020 war; the EU monitoring effort was a pragmatic, stabilising response when regional actors and bilateral mechanisms were insufficient.

Analytical point: a short, politically mandated monitoring mission—deployed rapidly and limited in scope—can function as an evaluative instrument that creates political space and justification for a more durable institutional presence when conditions warrant it.

### 2. UK–EU rapprochement: energy and defence re‑engagement

- Summit effect: the summit produced a measurable thaw in relations between the United Kingdom and European institutions, signalling selective post‑Brexit re‑engagement.
- UK commitments:
  - Re‑engagement with the North Seas Energy Cooperation (NSEC), a regional forum centred on offshore renewable energy, cross‑border grid integration and decarbonisation of the North Sea basin.
  - Participation in Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) frameworks, including the Military Mobility programme designed to facilitate rapid cross‑border movement of forces and equipment.
- Implications: these commitments had both symbolic and practical significance. Symbolically, they indicated willingness by the UK to cooperate with EU security and energy initiatives despite Brexit. Practically, they advanced regional energy projects and improved logistics for defence cooperation.

Analytical point: inclusive political fora can provide low‑cost, high‑visibility opportunities to rebuild functional cooperation across political ruptures; participation in sectoral mechanisms (energy grids, mobility corridors) can yield immediate operational benefits even where formal political integration is lacking.

### 3. Moldova summit: financing and civilian institutional support

- Second summit context: held in Moldova, the summit coincided with a series of concrete assistance measures aimed at strengthening Moldova’s resilience.
- Financial support: the European Peace Facility (EPF) provided an €87 million contribution of non‑military logistical aid. The EPF—an EU instrument for supporting peace, conflict prevention and defence‑related capacity building outside the EU—was used flexibly to deliver logistical assistance rather than lethal materiel.
- Institutional follow‑up: leaders agreed to establish a civilian EU mission in Chișinău. Civilian missions characteristically focus on rule‑of‑law assistance, border management, security sector reform and capacity development—objectives tailored to strengthen Moldova’s governance and resilience against destabilising pressures.

Analytical point: combining targeted financing instruments with civilian missions demonstrates a calibrated EU approach—mixing material support and institutional capacity‑building—to shore up neighbouring states without direct military intervention.

### 4. Broader pattern and geopolitical significance

Taken together, the EPC summit outputs illustrate several recurring features:
- Conversion of political dialogue into operational outcomes: summits led directly to fielded missions, concrete funding allocations and explicit cooperation commitments.
- Flexible use of EU instruments: the EU leveraged both rapid short‑term monitoring and longer‑term missions, and used financial instruments (EPF) in non‑military roles to meet immediate logistical needs.
- Bridging political divides: the platform enabled re‑engagement by non‑EU actors (notably the UK), showing that inclusive formats can rebuild functional cooperation even after major political ruptures.
- Operational lesson: short‑term monitoring missions, when properly scoped and politically endorsed, can serve as reconnaissance and confidence‑building mechanisms that justify and inform subsequent long‑term institutional commitments.

### 5. Lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy

Although the European Political Community is a Eurocentric construct, the EPC experience holds several applicable lessons for Indian strategic planners and policymakers:

- Utility of inclusive political platforms: an open regional forum that brings together EU and non‑EU actors proved effective in mobilising resources quickly and in ways that were politically acceptable to diverse participants. India’s neighbourhood and regional engagements could benefit from similarly inclusive mechanisms that permit pragmatic cooperation without requiring full institutional integration.
- Sequencing: short, narrowly mandated monitoring or support missions can be used as deliberate sequenced steps—initial stabilisation, assessment, then institutionalisation—minimising escalation while permitting flexible escalation of assistance if needed.
- Instruments and flexibility: having a repertoire of instruments (financial facilities, civilian missions, logistical aid) allows tailoring responses to partner needs and political sensitivities. India’s external assistance architecture could emulate such flexibility by calibrating grants, civilian capacity‑building and logistics support.
- Bridging political ruptures via sectoral cooperation: sectoral projects (energy grids, transport/military mobility corridors) can serve as confidence builders even when broader political relations are strained. For India, cooperation on infrastructure, maritime safety, or counterterrorism logistics could function similarly with reluctant partners.
- Political signalling: participation in collective initiatives can deliver strategic signals—of commitment, reassurance or intent—without formal alliance commitments. India’s calibrated participation in multilateral initiatives (regional or global) can be an instrument of strategic signalling.

Concluding remark: the EPC summits demonstrate how political gatherings can be deliberately designed to produce operational outputs—missions, funding, institutional setups—rather than remain purely declaratory. For Indian strategic culture, which prizes strategic autonomy and calibrated engagement, the EPC model underscores the value of flexible instruments, sequenced operational commitments, and inclusive political platforms to address transnational security challenges and regional instability.

## The European Political Community: Purpose, Endorsements, and Implications for Strategic Practice

Summary
- The European Political Community (EPC) has been advanced as an inclusive, non‑duplicative forum for continent‑wide political dialogue. Political leaders and institutional stakeholders have publicly endorsed its creation as a space for periodic, high‑level exchange that brings together EU and non‑EU European states without creating a new supranational body or displacing existing accession or regional processes.

Origins and stated purpose
- The EPC emerged from a deliberate effort to craft a political forum that can convene a broad set of European actors to coordinate on shared challenges — security, energy, migration, infrastructure and crisis response — while avoiding institutional overlap with existing organisations (the EU, the Council of Europe, OSCE, NATO). Its founding rationale emphasizes breadth of participation and political convening power rather than legal authority: the EPC is designed to facilitate dialogue, trust‑building and joint political messaging rather than to create binding commitments or new enforcement mechanisms.

Political endorsements and public framing
- Germany: Chancellor Olaf Scholz proposed the idea that the EPC could institutionalize regular political‑level exchanges (suggested frequency: once or twice a year). Scholz framed the EPC as a mechanism to sustain high‑level dialogue across the continent on issues that transcend membership lines.
- Albania and the Netherlands: Prime Minister Edi Rama (Albania) and Prime Minister Mark Rutte (Netherlands) publicly endorsed Emmanuel Macron’s EPC proposal (Politico, 5 October 2022). In their joint commentary they stressed the EPC should be an inclusive platform that expressly avoids duplicating the functions of existing regional organisations and must not displace the EU accession trajectory for aspirant states.
- United Kingdom: In a March 2023 command paper presented to the UK Parliament the UK government described the EPC as a “notable and welcome new forum for continent‑wide cooperation.” Post‑Brexit British support signals the EPC’s utility as a vehicle for maintaining sustained political engagement with European partners outside the institutional bounds of the EU.
- European Economic Area (EEA) Consultative Committee: The Committee welcomed the EPC’s formation, viewing it as a useful arena to discuss matters related to peace and stability across Europe. This endorsement by economic and social partners underlines the perceived value of a political space to address cross‑border economic and social challenges.

Intended membership and participation logic
- The EPC is conceived as an inclusive forum bringing together EU members and non‑EU states across Europe — including, for example, the UK, Western Balkan countries, EEA states and other European capitals. The inclusive logic is explicit: participation is based on geography and common interest in continental dialogue rather than on EU institutional membership. That open composition is intended to broaden political reach and enable conversations that would otherwise be complicated by formal EU membership rules.

Nature, frequency and practical format of meetings
- The project has been presented as a forum for periodic high‑level political dialogue — summits or ministerial meetings held once or twice per year — rather than an institution with continuous governance responsibilities. This episodic format implies outputs will be political declarations, joint statements or coordinated initiatives, with limited permanent secretariat functions unless states agree otherwise.

Complementarity and safeguards against duplication
- Supporters consistently emphasize that the EPC must complement, not duplicate or undermine, existing organisations and processes: the EU (and its acquis and accession mechanisms), the Council of Europe, the OSCE and NATO. Explicit safeguards were frequently invoked in public statements to reassure stakeholders — particularly EU accession candidates — that the EPC would not displace legal or institutional tracks such as EU enlargement.

Likely outputs and operational limits
- Given the EPC’s framing by proponents, realistic outputs are political communiqués, coordinated positions, symbolic joint initiatives and possibly time‑bound cooperative efforts (crisis coordination, infrastructure corridors, energy or migration contingency planning). The EPC is not structured to produce binding treaties or to exercise supranational authority; its value rests on political leverage and agenda‑setting capacity.

Benefits — strategic advantages of the EPC model
- A low‑threshold venue for diplomacy: By allowing EU and non‑EU states to meet regularly at high political level, the EPC can sustain dialogue where other forums might be constrained.
- Bridge‑building across divides: The EPC can reduce friction between EU insiders and outsiders (notably the UK and Western Balkans), enabling practical cooperation on cross‑border problems.
- Flexible crisis coordination: In episodic or ad‑hoc configurations the EPC can mobilize consensus for coordinated responses in areas like energy security, migration management and infrastructure resilience.
- Wider buy‑in for continental initiatives: The opportunity to secure political agreement across a broad set of European states can increase the legitimacy of joint statements or collective initiatives.

Risks, challenges and pathologies to watch
- Role ambiguity and mission creep: Without clear remit and governance mechanisms the EPC risks expanding into areas already covered by established organisations, creating confusion or multi‑track policymaking.
- Duplication and friction with existing bodies: If the EPC undertakes activities that overlap materially with EU, OSCE, Council of Europe or NATO functions, it can provoke institutional competition and inefficiency.
- Legitimacy and agenda control: Questions about who sets the agenda, who chairs meetings, and what decision‑making rules apply could generate perceptions that larger states disproportionately shape outcomes.
- Impact on accession processes: Even with assurances, there is a political risk that informal forums could create parallel tracks that unintentionally dilute the clarity of formal accession criteria or public expectations.
- Resource and follow‑through limitations: Political declarations without institutional follow‑up or resourcing will limit the EPC’s practical impact.

Practical considerations for design and implementation
- Membership rules and criteria: Define clearly which states participate and on what legal or political basis (geographic, regional grouping, invited observers).
- Meeting frequency, format and chairing: Decide whether the EPC will meet annually or biannually, how hosting rotates, and whether ministerial or head‑of‑state tracks will be maintained.
- Relationship with EU institutions: Articulate formal linkages with the European Council, Commission and Parliament to prevent overlap and enable information sharing.
- Decision‑making and outputs: Establish whether the EPC will operate by consensus, qualified majority or simply via non‑binding communiqués; specify mechanisms for translating political statements into coordinated action.
- Secretariat or support structure: Determine whether a small permanent secretariat is needed to support meeting preparation, follow‑up and thematic working groups.

Key policy indicators to monitor
- Formalisation of membership criteria and list of participants.
- Public statements clarifying the EPC’s remit vis‑à‑vis the EU, Council of Europe, OSCE and NATO.
- Scheduling decisions (annual/biannual summit calendar) and the emergence of ministerial or technical tracks.
- The nature of EPC outputs — whether symbolic declarations or concrete cooperative initiatives with resourcing.
- Reactions from EU accession candidates and whether the EPC includes explicit safeguards for accession processes.
- Signals from major actors (EU institutions, Germany, France, UK, Western Balkans) about the EPC’s evolving authority and legitimacy.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy thinking
- Comparative lessons: For Indian strategists seeking to understand avenues for regional dialogue, the EPC offers a useful case study in designing a low‑institutional‑cost, inclusive political forum. It shows how states can create space for cross‑border coordination while preserving existing legal tracks — a model relevant to South Asian or Indo‑Pacific multilateral innovation where sovereignty sensitivities and institutional fragmentation persist.
- Utility for India’s external policy: India watches European experimentation with inclusive, non‑binding forums because such mechanisms can facilitate issue‑based cooperation without forcing alignment into existing alliances. This resonates with India’s preference for flexible, ad‑hoc coalitions and diplomatic hedging.
- Risks to replicate or avoid: Indian policymakers should note the EPC’s vulnerabilities — agenda capture by powerful states, mission creep and legitimacy debates — when designing or participating in regional fora. Ensuring transparent membership rules, clear remits, and follow‑through mechanisms can mitigate these risks.
- Strategic posture: The EPC case reinforces a core tenet of India’s strategic culture: the value of diversified engagement. India can draw from the EPC example to calibrate its own use of inclusive political platforms to advance normative goals (stability, connectivity, crisis cooperation) without committing to supranational integration.

Concluding observation
- The European Political Community is an illustrative attempt to reconcile broad political inclusion with respect for existing institutional boundaries. For scholars of strategic culture and for policy practitioners — in Europe, South Asia, and beyond — it exemplifies how states can institutionalize high‑level dialogue to manage shared risks while remaining cautious about the limits of non‑binding fora. How the EPC defines membership, remit, and follow‑through will determine whether it becomes a durable instrument of continental governance or another ephemeral diplomatic convening.

### The European Political Community (EPC): Critiques, Institutional Positioning and Strategic Signalling — implications for comparative study and India’s strategic sensibilities

Introduction  
The creation of the European Political Community (EPC) triggered immediate commentary that reveals how new multilateral formats are debated as much for what they might do as for what they symbolically signal. Reported criticism — summarized by news outlets such as the Associated Press — clustered around three propositions: the EPC could be a vehicle to slow or circumvent formal European Union (EU) enlargement; it risked becoming a largely ceremonial “talking shop”; and its first summit’s lack of a formal declaration, funding offers or concrete EU programmes reinforced scepticism about its substantive value. These responses, together with reactions from existing European organisations and from states outside the EU (notably Russia), illuminate the interplay between institutional design, legitimacy, and geopolitical interpretation. The following section unpacks those debates, draws out key implications and notes lines of inquiry useful for students of strategic culture — including India’s — interested in how multilateral fora are instrumented, contested and perceived.

Critics’ claims and their logic
- Slowing EU enlargement: Critics argued the EPC could function as an alternative forum for engagement that offers prospective members political contact without the binding commitments and conditionality of EU accession. By providing a high‑level platform for dialogue, the EPC was seen as potentially reducing pressure on the EU to advance formal enlargement processes, thereby “putting the brakes on” accession momentum. The underlying worry is institutional substitution: a non‑binding, broad forum may absorb diplomatic energy that otherwise would be channelled toward the accession track.
- “Talking shop” objections: Labeling the EPC a “talking shop” captures fears that it lacks the mechanisms for translating dialogue into policy — absence of legally binding instruments, limited secretariat capacity, infrequent summits and no clear follow‑up architecture. Such critiques emphasise the difference between rhetorical community‑building and operationalised institutionalisation that produces programmes, budgets and enforcement.
- Reading the inaugural summit: The first EPC summit’s failure to produce a formal declaration, or to propose EU financial packages or concrete programmes, was interpreted by sceptics as evidence that the forum’s ambition was limited. Conversely, this cautious inaugural posture can also be read as a deliberate diplomatic choice to prioritise relationship‑building before institutionalising contentious commitments — a familiar pattern in the evolution of multilateral bodies.

Institutional positioning: relation to the Council of Europe
- Functional overlap and role clarity: A Council of Europe spokesperson noted that in core areas such as human rights, democracy and rule of law a pan‑European forum already exists. This intervention highlights a central institutional question: what distinctive competence does the EPC claim vis‑à‑vis existing organisations? The Council of Europe is an older, non‑EU intergovernmental organisation with a broader membership and a legal infrastructure (e.g., the European Court of Human Rights) that the EPC does not replicate.
- Pragmatic engagement despite rivalry: Despite rhetorical distinctions, institutions and their leaders may pursue practical engagement. The attendance of Marija Pejčinović Burić, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, at the 4th EPC summit in the UK (July 2024) signals pragmatic overlap: organisations may coexist and interact even where they publicly assert different mandates. This pattern suggests that public institutional contestation does not preclude operational linkages.

Geopolitical reactions: Russia and the politics of interpretation
- External framing as containment: Russia publicly criticised the EPC as an attempt by Brussels to form an anti‑Russian coalition and to rally states into sanctioning behaviour. Such framing illustrates how multilateral initiatives are interpreted through a geopolitical lens: forums intended to foster cooperation can be portrayed by external actors as instruments of alignment or encirclement.
- Diplomatic consequences: Accusations that the EPC might be used to coordinate sanctions or foreign‑policy measures underlines a concern that even consultative platforms can become arenas for security‑policy coordination. External states may respond with reciprocal diplomatic measures, information campaigns, or revisionist narratives that seek to delegitimise new institutions.

Key implications for legitimacy, effectiveness and accession politics
- Perception risk for candidate countries: If the EPC comes to be seen as a substitute for accession pathways, candidate states could view it with suspicion — as a mechanism that offers engagement without delivering the institutional benefits of membership. That perception can complicate domestic politics in candidates and affect the credibility of the EU accession promise.
- Overlap, legitimacy and added value: Institutional overlap with bodies like the Council of Europe raises questions of role clarity and added value. A forum’s legitimacy hinges on whether it offers distinct benefits (policy instruments, finance, dispute resolution, normative authority) or merely rhetorical affirmation.
- Effectiveness judged by outputs: Ultimately, the EPC’s practical impact will be measured by tangible outputs — declarations with follow‑up mechanisms, joint programmes, budgetary commitments, and routine institutional linkages with EU instruments. Without these, the “talking shop” critique may harden into a durable judgment.
- Geopolitical signalling matters: The pattern of participation, the content of communiqués, and external commentary shape how third parties interpret European unity or division. The EPC’s form and rhetoric therefore have consequences beyond internal European politics.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and policy-makers (comparative lessons)
- Institutional design and expectations management: For Indian policy-makers contemplating multilateral formats or engaging with them, the EPC case underscores the importance of designing institutions with clear mandates, follow‑through mechanisms and transparent linkages to existing bodies. Ambiguity invites contestation and misinterpretation.
- Signals and strategic narratives: New fora will be read geopolitically. India should anticipate how its initiatives (and its participation in others) may be framed by rivals or partners and plan communications to manage narrative risks.
- Pragmatism over rhetoric: The Council of Europe’s pragmatic engagement with the EPC demonstrates that functional interaction can coexist with rhetorical differentiation. India’s strategic culture — which often balances principle and pragmatism — may find resonance in engaging across forums while preserving institutional independence.
- Monitoring soft‑institutionalisation: India should note the distinction between symbolic summits and institution‑building. Effective engagement requires attention to secretariat capacity, funding, and follow‑up; otherwise, forums risk becoming arenas for prestige rather than policy.

Suggested empirical indicators and follow‑up (for researchers and policy analysts)
- Track formal outputs: monitor subsequent EPC summits for declarations, joint programmes and explicit budgetary commitments.
- Observe institutional linkages: assess whether the EPC institutionalises working groups, a secretariat or formal cooperation arrangements with EU bodies or the Council of Europe.
- Membership and attendance patterns: analyse which states attend, whether ad hoc exclusions or inclusions occur, and the presence of non‑EU organisations’ leaders as indicators of complementarity or competition.
- Analyse discourse: examine EPC communications for explicit references to enlargement, accession processes or EU instruments to determine whether the EPC positions itself as complement or substitute.
- Monitor third‑party responses: record how external actors (Russia, Turkey, the UK, Ukraine and others) publicly frame the EPC and whether that framing translates into concrete diplomatic or coercive measures.

Conclusion
The early debates surrounding the EPC reveal perennial tensions in multilateralism: the contest between symbol and substance, overlapping mandates, and the geopolitical reading of institutional innovation. Whether the EPC evolves into a substantive instrument or remains a high‑level consultative forum will depend on choices about follow‑through, institutional architecture and the political will of participating states. For students of strategic culture — including those studying India’s evolving security posture — the EPC episode is a compact lesson in how institutional form, messaging and follow‑through together shape both domestic perceptions and international reactions.
