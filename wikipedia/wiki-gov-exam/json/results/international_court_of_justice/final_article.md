### Primary judicial organ of the United Nations — the International Court of Justice

Overview
- The International Court of Justice (ICJ; French: Cour internationale de justice, CIJ), commonly called the World Court, is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. Established by the UN Charter in June 1945 and commencing work in April 1946, it is the modern successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) of the League of Nations (established 1920). The ICJ’s founding Statute is an integral part of the UN Charter and retains much of the PCIJ’s procedural and substantive design.

Mandate and principal functions
- Contentious cases between States: The ICJ settles legal disputes submitted to it by states. It is the only global court whose contentious jurisdiction is expressly organized to adjudicate general disputes between sovereign States.
- Advisory opinions: The Court issues advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UN General Assembly, Security Council, and certain specialized agencies. These opinions are non‑binding but carry substantial legal and political influence.
- Sources and significance: ICJ judgments and opinions are treated as primary sources of international law; they interpret treaties, custom, general principles and can crystallize or develop norms relevant to state practice and opinio juris.

Jurisdiction: consent and limits
- Consent as the basis of jurisdiction: Unlike domestic courts, the ICJ lacks compulsory jurisdiction over States except where consent is given. Consent may be expressed through:
  - Special agreements (ad hoc submission of a dispute),
  - Treaty clauses conferring jurisdiction, or
  - Declarations under the Court’s Statute accepting compulsory jurisdiction (historically Article 36(2) declarations).
- Practical consequences: Because jurisdiction depends on state consent, the ICJ is well suited to legal adjudication between willing parties but cannot unilaterally adjudicate disputes involving non‑consenting States. This structural reality constrains the Court’s use in acute strategic or security conflicts.

Composition, election and institutional features
- Bench composition: The Court is composed of 15 judges, each elected to nine‑year terms. Judges are elected by the UN General Assembly and the Security Council independently (a candidate must obtain an absolute majority in both organs).
- Representation rules: The Statute requires that the bench represent “the main forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems of the world.” No two judges may be nationals of the same State.
- Independence and rotation: Judges sit as independent jurists (not as State representatives). Elections are staggered so that roughly one‑third of the bench is renewed every three years, a design that balances continuity with periodic renewal.

Seat, language and location
- Seat: The Court sits at the Peace Palace in The Hague — the only principal organ of the United Nations not based in New York.
- Working languages: English and French are the Court’s official working languages; pleadings and judgments are issued in these languages as appropriate.

Procedural footprint and caseload
- Early and cumulative docket: The first contentious case was filed in 1947. As of November 2023 the ICJ had entertained 191 cases (contentious cases and advisory proceedings taken together).
- Typical disputes: The Court’s docket classically involves territorial and maritime boundary disputes, diplomatic and consular relations, treaty interpretation, state responsibility, and questions of immunities and use of force.

Binding nature of judgments and enforcement
- Finality and binding force: Judgments in contentious cases are final and binding upon the parties to the case.
- Enforcement limits: The ICJ lacks a coercive enforcement mechanism. Compliance is politically and legally persuasive but practically dependent on states’ willingness to comply. The UN Security Council may be called upon to take measures to give effect to Court judgments, but Security Council enforcement is subject to the veto power of its five permanent members — a significant political limitation on the Court’s effective enforcement capacity.

Advisory opinions: normative influence beyond binding force
- Nature and effect: Advisory opinions are not binding but often contribute decisively to the development of international legal norms, clarify legal questions for UN organs and agencies, and exert political pressure. Notable advisory work (e.g., on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons) influences state practice and normative debates relevant to national security and arms policy.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Legal forum and strategic choice: As a UN member and therefore a party to the ICJ Statute, India has access to the Court as a forum to resolve interstate disputes or to seek advisory clarification of legal questions that bear on strategic policy. However, the consent‑based jurisdiction and enforcement limits make ICJ litigation a strategic choice rather than an automatic avenue—India (like other states) will weigh legal remedies against diplomatic, political and military considerations.
- Norm development and reputational utility: Even when not binding, ICJ opinions can shape the normative environment for issues central to India’s security (e.g., use of force, maritime delimitation, immunities, human rights consequences of counter‑terror measures). The Court can thus serve as an instrument for legal validation and reputational management in international disputes.
- Empirical note: India has used the ICJ selectively (for example, in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case against Pakistan, where provisional measures and a later judgment addressed consular access and review of the conviction). Such selective recourse illustrates the Court’s role as a strategic legal lever rather than a universal adjudicative forum.

Conclusion
- The ICJ is the UN’s principal judicial organ and a unique global forum for interstate adjudication and legal clarification. Its strengths lie in legal authority, interpretive power and norm‑shaping capacity; its limits arise from reliance on state consent and lack of direct enforcement tools. For states such as India, the ICJ is an instrument to be deployed judiciously—useful for settling certain disputes, clarifying legal obligations, and shaping the international legal environment that conditions national security policy.

### 3.x The Hague Peace Conferences and the Birth of Permanent International Arbitration

Summary
- The first institutional attempt to create a standing mechanism for peaceful settlement of state-to-state disputes was the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA).
- The PCA emerged from the First Hague Peace Conference (1899), an initiative of Russian Tsar Nicholas II that brought together major and many smaller powers to negotiate rules limiting recourse to force and to devise mechanisms for peaceful dispute settlement.
- The 1899 conference produced the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, which created the PCA’s institutional and procedural framework, located in The Hague and supported by a permanent bureau (a registry-like secretariat).
- The PCA was formally established in 1900 and began hearing cases in 1902; its rules were revised and strengthened at the Second Hague Peace Conference (1907).
- At the 1907 conference leading states (including the United States, Great Britain and Germany) proposed a permanent, salaried international court with a full-time bench; delegates failed to agree on judge selection procedures, and the proposal was deferred — an early reflection of the tension between state sovereignty and permanent adjudication.
- Ideas from the Hague movement influenced early regional judicial experiments such as the Central American Court of Justice (established 1908).
- Multiple proposals for a global permanent court circulated between 1911 and 1919; however, the creation of a true standing international tribunal awaited the institutional reordering after the First World War (Permanent Court of International Justice, 1920) and ultimately the post‑Second World War establishment of the International Court of Justice.
- The PCA endures today as a flexible, consent-based institution providing arbitration, conciliation, fact-finding and registry services rather than a single permanent bench of judges.

Origins and institutional design
- The Hague Peace Conferences (1899 and 1907) marked the first multilateral diplomatic attempt to codify rules governing the conduct of warfare and to institutionalize peaceful dispute resolution among sovereign states. The 1899 conference was convened at the personal instigation of Tsar Nicholas II, reflecting fin-de-siècle currents that sought legal restraints on war.
- The 1899 Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes created what became the Permanent Court of Arbitration. Importantly, the PCA was not conceived as a standing, salaried tribunal with permanent judges. Rather, it combined:
  - A permanent bureau to provide administrative, registry and facilitation services; and
  - A list-based mechanism whereby states that were party to the convention supplied lists of potential arbitrators; parties to a dispute would appoint arbitrators from those lists or agree on others, and an arbitral tribunal would be constituted for each case.
- The PCA thus institutionalized arbitration while preserving state control over who would adjudicate any particular dispute. Those procedural choices reflected a deliberate compromise: international dispute settlement must be regularized and supported administratively, yet binding decision-making remained consensual and episodic.

The 1907 Conference and the question of permanence
- The Second Hague Peace Conference (1907) refined procedural rules for arbitration and strengthened the administrative apparatus supporting the PCA. It also exposed an unresolved institutional fault line.
- Delegations from the United States, Great Britain and Germany proposed creating a permanent, full‑time international court with salaried judges — a blueprint closer to modern conceptions of a standing international judiciary. The primary obstacle to adoption was disagreement over judge selection: states feared loss of control, perceived threats to sovereign equality, and the political consequences of accepting a permanently constituted bench that might render binding judgments without ad hoc consent.
- The inability to agree on selection methods resulted in deferral of the permanent court idea. That impasse illustrates an enduring dynamic in international institutional design: the tension between desires for regularized, impartial adjudication and the insistence on sovereign consent and political control.

Regional experiments and the long road to a standing court
- The Hague conferences influenced regional initiatives. The Central American Court of Justice (established 1908) is an early example of a regional judicial experiment that drew on Hague-era ideas about legalized dispute settlement.
- Between 1911 and 1919 various proposals for a permanent international tribunal were floated, but the disruptions of the First World War and the political reconfiguration that followed were prerequisites for creating the Permanent Court of International Justice in 1920, which itself became a direct antecedent of the International Court of Justice after the Second World War.

Why the PCA matters — distinctive features and contemporary relevance
- Distinct from a standing court: The PCA’s core innovation is administrative permanence combined with adjudicative flexibility. It offers a standing secretariat, institutional continuity, and established procedures while leaving the composition of decision-making panels to the parties’ consent for each case.
- Practical services: The PCA today provides arbitration, conciliation, fact‑finding, and registry services to states, state entities, intergovernmental organizations, and increasingly private parties in disputes that have an international dimension.
- Enduring normative legacy: The Hague conferences and the PCA set important precedents — routinizing legal settlement, normalizing the use of neutral venues (The Hague), and promoting lists/rules that made arbitration predictable and professional. These precedents underpinned later developments toward permanent judicial organs.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Sovereignty and consent-based dispute resolution. The early Hague experience underscores a theme that has recurrently shaped Indian attitudes toward international adjudication: a strong preference for mechanisms that preserve sovereign control. For states like India, whose strategic culture emphasizes non-interference and sovereignty, the PCA’s model — a standing administrative framework but adjudication only by consent — is congenial. It reconciles institutionalization with state prerogatives.
- Aversion to compulsory jurisdiction. The 1907 failure to agree a permanent, compulsory court reflects a broader international skepticism, still salient in South Asian practice, about submitting to standing judicial jurisdiction that might constrain national security decision-making. India’s policy instincts—favoring ad hoc, negotiated procedures or bilateral/regional arrangements—find echoes in that historical debate.
- Utility of flexible institutions for security‑sensitive disputes. For disputes that implicate sensitive national-security or territorial claims, India’s strategic culture typically privileges bilateral negotiation, selective resort to neutral arbitration, or institutional fora where jurisdiction and procedures are explicitly consented to. The PCA’s flexibility makes it a practical option when India (or Indian entities) opts for an internationalized, legalized solution while retaining the right to select adjudicators and terms.
- Regionalism and experimentation. The early emergence of regional courts (e.g., the Central American Court of Justice) demonstrates plural institutional possibilities. For India, this suggests pathways: strengthening regional legal mechanisms in South Asia or selectively engaging with supranational fora where institutional design safeguards national interests.
- Long-term institutional evolution. The trajectory from the Hague conferences to the PCA, to the Permanent Court of International Justice and ultimately the International Court of Justice, shows incrementalism in international law — gradual accumulation of norms and institutions rather than sudden leaps. India’s approach to global judicialization can be read through that lens: cautious engagement, selective acceptance of compulsory elements, and preference for reforms that respect sovereign prerogatives.

Concise timeline
- 1899: First Hague Peace Conference (initiated by Tsar Nicholas II); Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes negotiated, establishing the PCA’s framework.
- 1900: Formal establishment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
- 1902: The PCA began hearing cases.
- 1907: Second Hague Peace Conference; PCA rules revised; proposal for a permanent salaried court tabled but deferred because of disagreement over judge selection.
- 1908: Central American Court of Justice established — an early regional judicial experiment influenced by Hague ideas.
- 1911–1919: Multiple proposals for a permanent international tribunal; realization deferred until post‑World War I institutional changes.

Concluding observation
The Hague conferences and the creation of the PCA represent a foundational moment in the institutionalization of international dispute settlement. Their mixed design — permanent administrative structures paired with ad hoc adjudication dependent on state consent — encapsulates a core dilemma of international law: how to reconcile the rule of law across borders with the sovereignty of states. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, that historical compromise remains instructive: it offers a template for engaging international dispute settlement in ways that institutionalize predictability while preserving essential sovereign control.

## The Permanent Court of International Justice

Origins and purpose
- The unprecedented carnage of the First World War catalyzed a rethinking of international order. At the 1919 Paris Peace Conference the victors sought institutional mechanisms to prevent recurrence of great‑power war; the League of Nations was the central product of that effort. Article 14 of the League’s Covenant expressly envisaged a permanent judicial organ — the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) — to adjudicate disputes submitted by states and to furnish advisory opinions when requested by the League and other organs.
- The PCIJ was thus conceived not as a temporary expedient but as part of a larger architecture for collective security and rule‑based conflict resolution. Its creation signaled an early twentieth‑century move from ad hoc arbitration toward standing international adjudication.

Establishment and institutional design
- After intense drafting and diplomatic negotiation, the League Assembly in December 1920 unanimously adopted the Statute of the PCIJ; the statute was signed and ratified by a majority of League members over the following year. The Statute embodied several procedural and institutional compromises reached among states with divergent legal traditions and political sensitivities.
- One particularly contentious issue — the composition and selection of judges — was resolved by requiring concurrent, but independent, elections by both the League Council and the Assembly. This dual‑election mechanism sought to balance the influence of great powers with wider membership legitimacy.
- The Statute also mandated that the bench reflect the “main forms of civilization and the principal legal systems of the world.” In practice this meant deliberate attention to geographic and legal‑system diversity so that the Court’s composition would command broad legitimacy.
- The PCIJ was permanently located at the Peace Palace in The Hague, sharing that symbolic and functional space with the Permanent Court of Arbitration. The choice of a single, permanent seat institutionalized presence and accessibility in a way earlier itinerant or ad hoc tribunals had not.

Innovations in international adjudication
- The PCIJ introduced several significant innovations compared with previous arbitral tribunals. It was the first standing international court governed by a detailed statute and a codified set of rules of procedure. These texts regulated everything from pleadings to provisional measures and the conduct of hearings.
- For the first time a permanent registry served as a sustained administrative organ and liaison between the Court, national governments and other international bodies — a professional bureaucracy that enhanced institutional memory and continuity.
- Proceedings before the PCIJ were largely public: pleadings, oral arguments and documentary evidence were generally accessible to states and often to the public. This emphasis on publicity promoted transparency and the perception of impartiality.
- The Statute was also the first instrument to list, in a relatively systematic fashion, the sources of law the Court would rely upon: treaties, international custom, general principles of law recognized by civilized nations, and subsidiary means such as judicial decisions and the teachings of publicists. That enumeration clarified judicial method and influenced subsequent doctrine on sources of international law.
- The PCIJ’s jurisdictional architecture combined voluntary accession and optional compulsory jurisdiction. Any state could appear before the Court by consent; additionally, states could make unilateral declarations accepting the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction for future disputes of specified categories — a mechanism that remains contested but long influential in international adjudication.

Performance, reach and juridical impact
- From its first session in 1922 until the outbreak of the Second World War effectively suspended its work in 1940, the PCIJ decided 29 interstate contentious cases and issued 27 advisory opinions. Its docket covered a wide range of questions — boundary disputes, treaty interpretation, state responsibility, and legal ramifications of state acts.
- The Court enjoyed broad practical acceptance. Several hundred bilateral and multilateral treaties of the interwar years conferred jurisdiction on the PCIJ for specified categories of disputes, making the Court a recognized locus of legal dispute settlement in international life.
- PCIJ judgments and advisory opinions had significant persuasive authority. While its decisions were legally binding only between the parties to a case, they frequently clarified ambiguous points of law and contributed to the crystallization of customary international law. In this way the PCIJ shaped legal doctrine beyond its immediate litigants.
- However, the PCIJ was not formally an organ of the League in the sense of being subordinate to it; League membership did not automatically make a state party to the PCIJ Statute. This separation reflected states’ desire to preserve judicial independence while also limiting automatic entanglement between political and judicial organs.
- The Court’s work effectively ceased during the Second World War. In 1945 the United Nations succeeded the League of Nations, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was established as the UN’s principal judicial organ. Many procedural features, judge‑selection practices and statutory formulations of the PCIJ were carried over into the ICJ’s design.

Political context and the United States
- The politics of the interwar period constrained universal acceptance of the new judicial forum. Most conspicuously, the United States never became a member of the League of Nations: despite declared support from successive presidents, the Senate never ratified League membership. That absence underscored limits to the ideal of universal institutionalization in the interwar order.
- Nonetheless, nationals of the United States served on the PCIJ bench, and American jurists contributed to the Court’s jurisprudence. The U.S. example illustrates how non‑membership in a political organization did not preclude individual participation in international judicial life.

Institutional legacy and continuing features
- The Peace Palace at The Hague remains a living symbol of the institutional continuity between the PCIJ and the ICJ: the latter occupies the same seat and adopted many of the procedural and substantive premises first systematized by the PCIJ.
- Several PCIJ features endured as durable elements of international adjudication: the registry as an administrative backbone, the emphasis on public proceedings and reasoned decisions, the use of advisory opinions to clarify law for international organs, and the device of compulsory jurisdiction by unilateral declaration (a mechanism that remains important but legally and politically contested).
- The PCIJ’s jurisprudence continues to be cited as persuasive authority; its successive opinions helped to professionalize international adjudication and to shape expectations about judicial method and transparency.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Though India as an independent state entered the international legal order after the PCIJ’s prime period, the Court’s institutional innovations and jurisprudential legacy bear directly on India’s strategic culture toward international law and dispute settlement.
- The PCIJ model — a standing, impartial, transparent judicial body with an expert registry and public proceedings — corresponds to institutional forms that many post‑colonial states, including India, later engaged with through the ICJ. Such institutions offered a routinized, law‑based path for resolving interstate disputes in lieu of coercive options, consonant with a strategic preference for legal avenues when they advance national interest.
- The Court’s emphasis on state consent (through adjudication by submission or acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction by declaration) reflects a principle central to India’s approach to international adjudication: respect for sovereignty and careful calibration of third‑party dispute mechanisms. India’s historical caution toward automatic or binding adjudicatory commitments is rooted in similar concerns about preserving strategic autonomy in an uncertain international environment.
- The PCIJ’s advisory opinion function proved particularly valuable for newly independent or transitioning polities seeking legal clarification on decolonization, treaty interpretation and state responsibility. For India, advisory procedures and declaratory jurisprudence of successor courts have offered tools to obtain authoritative legal guidance on matters intersecting sovereignty, maritime delimitation and use of force.
- Finally, the PCIJ’s innovations in representation and diversity — an early attempt to reflect different legal systems and civilizations on the bench — presaged concerns about global equity and voice in international adjudication that remain salient for India’s strategic posture: the desire for institutional arrangements that recognize plural legal traditions and that give non‑European states meaningful participation in rule‑making and dispute settlement.

Conclusion
- The PCIJ was a formative experiment in institutionalized international adjudication. Its statute, practices and jurisprudence advanced transparency, procedural regularity and juridical method, while accommodating the political imperatives of state consent and representation. Though superseded by the ICJ after World War II, the PCIJ’s institutional architecture and legal legacy continue to inform how states — including India — conceive and use international judicial mechanisms as instruments of strategy and policy.

### Establishment of the International Court of Justice — breakdown

This section traces the transition from the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) of the League of Nations to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. It outlines the political and legal choices made during 1933–1946, explains the institutional continuities and innovations, and draws out implications for newly independent and non‑Western states — including India — whose strategic cultures and approaches to sovereignty and dispute settlement were shaped by these arrangements.

1. Historical background: the decline of the PCIJ (1933–1940)
- The Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) reached the height of its activity in 1933, but the rise of interstate tensions, nationalist isolationism and the breakdown of multilateral cooperation during the 1930s produced a sharp decline in its docket and influence.  
- The outbreak of the Second World War effectively terminated the PCIJ’s work: its last public session took place in December 1939 and its final judicial orders were issued in February 1940. The Court’s operational capacity had been undermined by the conflict and by the collapse of the League system that underpinned it.

2. Wartime consensus for a postwar court (1942–1944)
- In 1942 the United Kingdom and the United States jointly declared their support for creating or re-establishing an international judicial body after the war. This bilateral endorsement signalled that the victorious powers intended to preserve international adjudication as part of the postwar order.  
- In 1943 the United Kingdom convened an international panel of jurists, commonly referred to as the Inter‑Allied Committee, to explore modalities for a postwar international court. The Committee’s report (1944) recommended several core features:
  - that a new court’s statute be modelled on the PCIJ statute (thereby preserving procedural and substantive experience);
  - that advisory jurisdiction be retained (to allow intergovernmental organs and specialized agencies to obtain legal opinions);
  - that acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction remain voluntary (protecting state consent and sovereignty); and
  - that the Court be confined to judicial, not political, matters (to preserve impartiality and legitimacy).
- At the 1943 Moscow Conference the “Big Four” (China, the USSR, the UK and the US) issued a public declaration endorsing the creation, at the earliest practicable date, of a general international organization based on sovereign equality and open to all peace‑loving states to maintain international peace and security. This declaration linked the project of a world organization to the re‑establishment of international justice.

3. Institutional design at Dumbarton Oaks and juridical drafting (1944–1945)
- The Dumbarton Oaks proposals (October 1944) set out the architecture of the new intergovernmental organization and included an international court as one of its principal organs. The Court was conceived as integral to a system emphasising collective security and legal adjudication.
- In April 1945, 44 jurists met in Washington, D.C., to draft a statute for the proposed court. Their draft adhered closely to the PCIJ statute and raised an important conceptual question: whether continuity with the PCIJ (through adoption of its statute and practice) would suffice, or whether a wholly new institution was required. The jurists’ consensus favoured continuity in statute and procedure while embedding the court in the broader UN constitutional framework.

4. San Francisco Conference and the decision to create a new UN organ (25 April–26 June 1945)
- Delegates at the UN Conference on International Organization in San Francisco (50 states represented) decided to establish an entirely new court as a principal organ of the United Nations. This was a political choice: rather than simply reviving the PCIJ, the drafters placed the Court firmly within the UN’s constitutional structure.
- To ensure legal and institutional continuity, the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was explicitly declared to be based on the PCIJ statute and was annexed to the UN Charter as an integral part of it. This dual move — creating a new Court but preserving the PCIJ statute — combined political re‑founding with juridical continuity.

5. Transition from PCIJ to ICJ (1945–1946)
- The PCIJ convened for the last time in October 1945. By a vote it decided to transfer its archives to the successor Court at the Peace Palace in The Hague, thereby preserving institutional memory and caselaw. The seat of both the PCIJ and the ICJ remained the Peace Palace.
- All PCIJ judges resigned on 31 January 1946 to make way for elections to the ICJ. The first elections for ICJ judges were held in February 1946: the process involved parallel, independent balloting in the UN General Assembly and the Security Council, a design choice that insured both democratic legitimacy and great‑power involvement.
- The PCIJ was formally dissolved in April 1946, and at the ICJ’s first meeting José Gustavo Guerrero (El Salvador), the last President of the PCIJ, was elected ICJ President — a symbolic and practical continuity.
- The ICJ appointed much of its Registry from the former PCIJ Registry staff and held its inaugural public sitting in April 1946. The first contentious case filed was the United Kingdom v. Albania (the Corfu Channel), submitted in May 1947; this dispute would later produce foundational jurisprudence on state responsibility and the law governing the use of force.

6. Key legal features carried forward and their strategic significance
- Statutory continuity: by annexing the ICJ Statute to the UN Charter and modelling it on the PCIJ Statute, the drafters preserved procedural rules, doctrines and institutional memory that accelerated the ICJ’s ability to resolve disputes.
- Advisory jurisdiction: retained explicitly to allow UN organs and specialized agencies to seek authoritative legal opinions — a tool that has been central to the progressive development of international law.
- Voluntary/consensual jurisdiction: the ICJ’s general competence is premised on state consent. Article 36’s “optional clause” mechanism was preserved as one route to (partial) compulsory jurisdiction, reflecting the Allied sensitivity to state sovereignty and the political limits of international adjudication.
- Judicial, not political, remit: the emphasis on adjudicating legal controversies rather than political questions was intended to preserve the Court’s independence and the acceptability of its decisions among sovereign states.

7. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Institutional choice and sovereignty: the ICJ’s architecture — particularly the requirement of state consent and the confinement of the Court to legal (rather than political) questions — resonated with states that prioritized sovereignty and non‑intervention. For India, whose strategic culture emphasizes legalism in diplomacy, the ICJ represented a forum that balanced principled dispute settlement with respect for sovereignty.
- Access to legal recourse: as a founding member of the United Nations, India acquired a standing to invoke the ICJ for interstate disputes and to benefit from advisory opinions that inform state practice and policy. The Court’s existence therefore provided an external legal channel that could complement, though not replace, political and strategic approaches to conflict.
- Continuity and legitimacy: the ICJ’s claim to continuity with the PCIJ and its constitutional anchoring in the UN Charter enhanced its legitimacy, making it a more attractive venue for newly independent and non‑Western states seeking impartial adjudication.
- Practical caution: the voluntariness of jurisdiction explains why many states, including India at various stages, have been selective in submitting disputes to the Court or accepting compulsory jurisdiction — a factual posture that reflects cautious strategic calculation rather than doctrinal rejection of international adjudication.

8. Timeline of pivotal dates
- 1933: PCIJ peak of activity, thereafter decline.  
- Dec 1939: PCIJ last public session.  
- Feb 1940: PCIJ last orders issued.  
- 1942: US–UK declaration supporting a postwar international court.  
- 1943: Inter‑Allied Committee; Moscow declaration by major Allies.  
- Oct 1944: Dumbarton Oaks proposals.  
- Apr 1945: Jurists meet in Washington to draft a statute.  
- 25 Apr–26 Jun 1945: San Francisco Conference establishes the ICJ as a UN organ.  
- Oct 1945: PCIJ’s final convening and archives transfer.  
- 31 Jan 1946: PCIJ judges resign.  
- Feb 1946: Elections of first ICJ judges.  
- Apr 1946: PCIJ formally dissolved; ICJ inaugural sessions.  
- May 1947: First contentious case filed (UK v. Albania — Corfu Channel).

9. Recommended primary sources and next steps for study
- The Statute of the International Court of Justice (annexed to the UN Charter), especially Article 36 and related provisions on jurisdiction.  
- The Corfu Channel case (pleadings, provisional measures, and final judgment) for early substantive jurisprudence on state responsibility and evidence.  
- Key PCIJ judgments and the PCIJ Statute for a comparative study of continuity and change.

Concluding note
The creation of the ICJ exemplifies a deliberate balancing act: political re‑founding within the UN’s constitutional framework paired with juridical continuity from the PCIJ. For India and other states whose strategic cultures prize sovereignty yet value legal avenues for dispute resolution, the ICJ’s design — voluntary jurisdiction, advisory competence, and a judicially framed remit — provided a durable, if limited, mechanism for the peaceful adjudication of interstate conflicts and the progressive development of international law.

## The International Court of Justice: Institution, Authority and Limits — Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture

### The Peace Palace and institutional lineage
The Peace Palace in The Hague is more than an architectural symbol; it is the seat of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and a locus for multiple international adjudicatory bodies, including the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). The ICJ itself was established by the United Nations Charter in 1945 and began work in 1946 as the principal judicial organ of the UN. It is explicitly the successor to the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), and its Statute — annexed to the UN Charter — carries forward much of the PCIJ’s structure, procedures and jurisprudential continuity.

### Constitutional framework and jurisdiction
The Statute of the International Court of Justice is the Court’s chief constitutional instrument and is integral to the UN Charter. It defines the Court’s composition, jurisdictional bases and procedure. Crucially, Article 36 of the Statute distinguishes two modes of jurisdiction: (1) jurisdiction by special agreement or treaty clauses, and (2) the so‑called “compulsory” or optional clause (Article 36(2)), by which states may accept the Court’s jurisdiction in advance. Acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction is voluntary, commonly qualified by reservations, and may be withdrawn — a feature that materially limits the Court’s automatic reach.

The ICJ’s judicial remit is twofold: it settles legal disputes between states (contentious cases) and gives advisory opinions to UN organs and specialized agencies on legal questions. Judgments in contentious cases are binding upon the parties to the dispute.

### Judicial activity, enforcement mechanisms and practical limits
While ICJ judgments are binding on the parties, the Court has no independent enforcement arm. Chapter XIV of the UN Charter (notably Article 94) provides that if a party fails to comply with a judgment, the other party may apply to the Security Council, which may make recommendations or decide upon measures to enforce the judgment. In practice this enforcement route is political: the Security Council’s role is subject to the collective decision‑making rules of the Council, including the veto power of its five permanent members (P5). Political contestation among great powers therefore can and has constrained the practical enforceability of ICJ decisions.

The Court’s dual character — strong in normative and adjudicative terms but weak in direct coercive capacity — makes it a powerful source of legal legitimacy while leaving compliance contingent on broader geopolitical dynamics.

### Case study: Nicaragua v. United States (1986)
Nicaragua v. United States is a paradigmatic illustration of both the ICJ’s legal authority and the limits of enforcement in international politics. The Court found in 1986 that certain covert and overt actions by the United States in support of contra forces, and other measures such as mining Nicaraguan harbors, violated customary international law principles of non‑intervention and non‑use of force. The ICJ ordered remedies, including compensation.

In response, the United States rejected the Court’s jurisdictional basis for the case and subsequently withdrew from its previously declared acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. When Nicaragua sought Security Council action to enforce the judgment, the United States exercised its veto in the Council, effectively blocking enforcement measures. The episode exemplifies how even clear legal findings can be frustrated by the political prerogatives of powerful states.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For India—whose strategic culture emphasizes both legal legitimacy and political autonomy—the ICJ presents a mixed utility:

- Legal validation and multilateral legitimacy: India has progressively used international legal avenues selectively to secure legal validation for contentious matters (for example, resort to international arbitration or the ICJ in certain disputes). International adjudication can enhance normative legitimacy and international support for India’s positions.

- Selective resort and calibrated commitments: Given the optional and conditional nature of compulsory jurisdiction, and the Court’s dependence on political enforcement, Indian policy tends to be pragmatic. New Delhi has been cautious in blanket acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction and often prefers dispute‑specific or treaty‑based adjudicatory clauses, bilateral management mechanisms, and arbitration where enforceability is clearer.

- Awareness of power politics: The Nicaragua precedent and other instances where P5 politics constrain enforcement inform Indian calculations. When national security imperatives collide with international legal findings, New Delhi must weigh reputational costs against sovereignty and strategic imperatives. This calculus explains a measured, case‑by‑case use of the ICJ rather than wholesale judicialization of security disputes.

- Institutional complementarity: The existence of complementary fora at The Hague (PCA, arbitral tribunals, advisory mechanisms) expands India’s toolkit. India’s strategic posture thus combines legal engagement to secure normative gains with diplomatic and strategic measures to manage enforcement and compliance risks.

### Conclusion
The ICJ occupies a central place in the architecture of international law, offering authoritative dispute resolution and advisory functions grounded in the UN Charter and the Statute annexed thereto. Yet its effectiveness is bounded by the voluntariness of jurisdictional acceptance and by the political realities of Security Council enforcement. For India, the Court is an instrument to be used judiciously: a source of legal legitimacy and multilateral anchoring, but not a substitute for the strategic calculations that drive national security policy in an environment shaped by great‑power prerogatives and geopolitical contestation.

### Chapter X: The International Court of Justice — Composition, Election, and the Politics of the Bench

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the United Nations’ principal judicial organ and a central arena where law, diplomacy and strategic interests intersect. For states such as India — whose strategic culture prizes both rule-based order and autonomous agency — the composition and functioning of the ICJ matter not only legally but politically. This section outlines how the Court is constituted, how judges are chosen and replaced, the norms intended to safeguard judicial independence, the informal political practices that shape the bench, and the practical implications for representation and strategic posture.

1. Composition and tenure
- The Court comprises 15 judges, each elected to a nine‑year term. Re‑election is permitted and common.
- Elections are staggered so that one‑third of the bench (five judges) is elected every three years; this institutional design promotes continuity in jurisprudence and preserves institutional memory.
- The Court sits at The Hague. Its official working languages are English and French. The ICJ Statute is annexed to the UN Charter and governs the Court’s organization and procedure.

2. Nomination and election procedure
- Candidates are nominated not by governments directly but by “national groups” in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA). In practice, those nominations reflect intensive state diplomacy and influence.
- Judges are elected simultaneously by the UN General Assembly and the UN Security Council; a candidate must obtain an absolute majority in both organs.
- The election procedure and many detailed rules are governed by Articles 4–19 of the ICJ Statute.
- If a judge dies or resigns before the end of a term, a special election is normally held to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the term.

3. Nationality, legal systems and representation
- Article 3 of the Statute prohibits more than one judge of the same nationality on the Court; judges nonetheless act in their personal capacity, not as state representatives.
- Article 9 articulates a further goal: the Court’s membership should reflect the “main forms of civilization and principal legal systems of the world.” The Statute thus institutionalizes both national diversity and pluralism of legal traditions.
- Interpretation of what constitutes the “main forms” of legal systems is contested, but customary practice seeks a mix that recognizes common law, civil law, socialist law and Islamic law traditions among others.
- Beyond these formal prescriptions, an informal regional distribution of seats has developed by political practice (not statutory rule). The commonly accepted breakdown is approximately: five Western European and other states, three African, two Eastern European, three Asian, and two Latin American and Caribbean judges.
- African representation has been nuanced to reflect linguistic and legal variety: the three African seats are typically allocated so as to include one Francophone civil-law jurist, one Anglophone common‑law jurist, and one judge from the Arab region of Africa.

4. Great‑power presence and political practice
- In practice the Permanent Five (P5) members of the Security Council have almost always had a presence on the bench, frequently occupying multiple regional slots in different electoral cycles. This long‑standing pattern reflects great‑power influence in international institutional politics.
- There have been notable exceptions that reveal the political dynamics of elections. China lacked an ICJ judge between 1967 and 1985. The United Kingdom briefly lacked a judge after the 2017 election, when Sir Christopher Greenwood failed to obtain a majority in the General Assembly despite strong support in the Security Council; instead India’s Dalveer Bhandari was elected following an intensive diplomatic campaign.
- Such episodes illustrate that formal rules interact with contestatory politics: seat occupancy is not guaranteed and can be contested, especially when states invest diplomatic capital and mobilize support among other states.

5. Qualifications, style and outside activities
- Article 6 requires that judges be persons of “high moral character” who either possess the qualifications required for the highest judicial offices in their countries or are jurisconsults of recognized competence in international law.
- To underscore the institutional stature of the office, judges carry the style “His/Her Excellency.”
- Articles 16–18 of the Statute and related Charter provisions address judicial independence. They stipulate strictures on political activity and conflicts of interest: judges must not exercise political or administrative functions (Article 16 as commonly read) and should refrain from professions or posts that compromise independence; Article 17 restricts participation in cases where a judge had prior involvement (for example, as agent, counsel or advocate).
- In principle, judges may not take up other official posts or act as counsel. In practice, however, some judges have accepted outside arbitration work or academic posts when no direct conflict arises. This “moonlighting” has sparked debate: some jurists and commentators call for tighter, clearer rules to minimize even perceived conflicts and to protect the Court’s authority.

6. Independence, accountability and removal
- Judicial independence is foundational but not impregnable. Articles 16–18 are intended to protect impartiality. Removal of a judge is extremely difficult: dismissal can occur only by a vote of the other members of the Court (the Statute envisages that a judge may be removed for inability to perform duties or for severe misconduct), effectively requiring a very high threshold — in practice unanimity of the other judges has been described as necessary.
- Political contestation has at times cast doubt on perceptions of impartiality. During the Nicaragua litigation (1980s), for example, the United States indicated discomfort with the Court’s composition and suggested limits on what it would submit given the presence of judges from the Soviet bloc — an episode that highlighted how geopolitical tensions can impinge upon perceptions of judicial independence.

7. Decision‑making, opinions and judicial practice
- Decisions on contentious cases and advisory opinions are taken by majority vote. Where there is an equal division, the President’s vote is decisive — a rule that has played a determinative role in close advisory matters (the 1996 advisory opinion on nuclear weapons is often cited as an example of close votes and the salience of presidential influence).
- Judges may append separate concurring or dissenting opinions; these separate opinions are an important source of doctrinal development and reflect the Court’s pluralistic reasoning.

8. Representation gaps and recent trends
- Gender representation has been a persistent concern: until very recently only five women had ever been elected to the Court during roughly seven‑plus decades of its existence — a fact that has spurred calls for proactive nomination and electoral strategies to remedy gender imbalance.
- Geopolitical shifts are also visible. For example, in the 2023 elections (members taking office in 2024) no judge from Russia or the wider CIS was elected — the first time since the historical succession of the Court that a Russian presence has been absent. Such outcomes can be interpreted as reflections of changing geopolitical alignments and reputational dynamics among UN membership.
- There is increasing scrutiny of judges’ outside activities and renewed debate about clearer rules on conflicts of interest, disclosure, and acceptable external work. States, NGOs and academics continue to press for measures that enhance transparency and strengthen public confidence.

9. Implications for India’s strategic culture and legal diplomacy
- India’s successful campaign in 2017 to elect Justice Dalveer Bhandari illustrated several features important to Indian strategic culture: sustained diplomatic mobilization, coalition‑building among developing states, and the projection of normative leadership in international law fora.
- Indian strategic interest in the ICJ is twofold: first, as a forum for dispute settlement and advisory opinion that can affect critical matters of national security and international responsibility; second, as an institutional platform where presence and voice matter — a national judge can influence jurisprudence and provide informal channels for legal diplomacy.
- The contested politics of nominations and elections reinforces a longer standing lesson for Indian foreign policy: global legal institutions are arenas of soft power and coalition politics. India’s approach has thus combined appeals to principles (rule of law, decolonization, equitable representation) with pragmatic electoral diplomacy.

10. Concluding observations and reform debates
- The ICJ’s design balances legal professionalism and political realities. Statutory rules (e.g., nationality limitations, representation aims, qualifications provisions) are buttressed and complicated by informal practices (regional allocations, P5 presence, diplomatic campaigning).
- Ongoing debates concern: strengthening gender and geographic representation; clarifying rules on outside activities and conflicts; and enhancing transparency in nominations. For a rising middle power like India, these debates offer opportunities to shape institutional norms consistent with a vision of a more inclusive, rules‑based international order.
- Scholars and policymakers alike should attend both to the letter of the Statute (Articles 3, 4–19, 6, 9, 16–18) and to the political practices that animate elections and judicial behaviour. Understanding both levels is essential to appreciating how the Court functions as an institution of international law and as a site of geopolitical contestation.

### Article 31 of the ICJ Statute: Ad hoc Judges — Mechanics, Purpose and Strategic Implications for India

Article 31 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice supplies a narrowly tailored but strategically consequential procedure: when a State party to a contentious case has no national among the sitting judges of the Court, it may appoint an additional person to sit as judge in that particular case. That person — an ad hoc judge — enjoys the same rights, duties and judicial oath as the Court’s elected members, but their mandate is strictly case‑bound: they participate only in the judicial work related to the specific dispute for which they are appointed.

Key features and mechanics
- The ICJ’s ordinary composition is fifteen elected judges, each serving nine‑year terms. Article 31 creates a temporary expansion of that bench in specified circumstances.
- A State may appoint an ad hoc judge only if it does not already have one of its nationals sitting on the Court. The appointment is case‑specific and ceases when the Court’s judgment is rendered.
- Because each party to a dispute in the described circumstances may appoint an ad hoc judge, a chamber that would normally comprise 15 judges can expand to a maximum of 17 for a single case.
- Ad hoc judges have identical procedural entitlements to elected judges while sitting on the case: they deliberate, hear evidence, participate in the drafting of opinions and cast votes in the final deliberation.

Institutional purpose: confidence through representation
- The principal raison d’être of the ad hoc mechanism is pragmatic and institutional: it lowers the political and psychological barrier for States to submit to the Court’s jurisdiction. Knowing that a national — someone who can bring local knowledge, legal perspective and a fuller appreciation of the State’s interests — will sit in deliberations makes States more willing to litigate before the ICJ.
- This channel of representation helps reconcile two competing institutional imperatives: the need for States to have sufficient confidence in the Court’s openness to their viewpoint, and the Court’s need to preserve its structural independence and legitimacy.

Tension with judicial impartiality and actual practice
- The ad hoc system sits uneasily beside orthodox notions of judicial impartiality: ad hoc judges are, by design, appointed by a party to the dispute. That origin risks a perception — sometimes a reality — of partiality.
- Empirically, the tension has been moderated rather than resolved. Ad hoc judges commonly, though not invariably, vote in line with the State that appointed them. Where both parties appoint ad hoc judges inclined to support their appointing States, those votes frequently cancel each other out and leave the aggregate outcome largely unaffected.
- Importantly, the system is not a deterministic device. There are notable instances where ad hoc judges have voted independently of the appointing State’s position and, in doing so, have shaped jurisprudence and outcomes in ways that could not be predicted solely from their appointing relationship.

Strategic implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For a State like India — which balances a strong preference for sovereign control over security matters with a growing engagement in multilateral legal fora — the ad hoc judge mechanism has distinct calculable effects:
  - Acceptance of jurisdiction: Indian decision‑makers are more likely to consider ICJ adjudication in disputes where the prospect of appointing an ad hoc judge reduces perceived strategic and legal risk. Representation in the Court’s deliberations can be politically salient in sensitive national security or territorial cases.
  - Selection strategy: India’s choice of an ad hoc appointee would be part of a broader litigation strategy — combining legal competence, credibility, and the capacity to convey India’s factual and normative context to colleagues on the bench without appearing overtly partisan.
  - Reputation and legitimacy: India must weigh the short‑term benefit of having a sympathetic tribunal member against longer‑term costs to international legal reputation if appointments are perceived as purely partisan or obstructionist of Court independence.
  - Complement to other instruments: The availability of an ad hoc judge may make ICJ litigation more attractive relative to bilateral dispute mechanisms or ad hoc arbitration in certain disputes, particularly where international law and precedent development weigh heavily on national interests.

Concluding observations
- Article 31’s ad hoc judge procedure is a carefully calibrated instrument: institutionally modest in scope but significant in its political and legal effects. It is designed to make the Court more accessible to States without fundamentally altering its institutional character.
- For States engaging on matters that implicate national security or strategic interests, awareness of the ad hoc mechanism is essential in both the decision to litigate before the ICJ and in shaping the litigation posture. India’s strategic culture — balancing sovereignty, legal engagement, and global influence — makes the ad hoc judge option a useful, if sometimes delicate, tool in its international legal repertoire.

### ICJ Chambers: Flexibility, Trade‑offs, and Implications for Indian Strategic Practice

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ordinarily sits as a full bench of all its judges when deciding cases, but the Statute provides a statutory mechanism for smaller chambers. For a state like India — whose strategic culture blends principled multilateralism with a cautious prioritisation of sovereignty and national security — understanding the legal basis, practical uses, and normative effects of ICJ chambers is important when considering international adjudication as a tool of dispute settlement or normative contestation.

Legal foundation and forms of chambers
- Articles 26–29 of the ICJ Statute allow the Court to constitute smaller chambers of judges (commonly three or five) to hear particular categories of disputes or to hear individual cases. The Statute envisages two broad uses:
  - Special chambers established under Article 26(1) for classes of cases (the 1993 provision conceived, for example, of a specialised environmental chamber, though this has not been used in practice).
  - Ad hoc chambers formed under Article 26(2) for particular disputes at the request of the parties, allowing them to select a composition acceptable to both.
- Article 59 is also relevant for any ICJ decision: judgments are binding only between the parties and in respect of that case, and they do not operate as binding precedents for other disputes. This doctrinal point complicates claims about the “precedential” power of chamber versus full‑Court decisions.

Why chambers are used — practical and political motives
- Party autonomy and acceptability: Ad hoc chambers are a compromise mechanism. When states insist on particular judges (for reasons of perceived impartiality, regional representation, or legal culture), the chamber option allows them to proceed without risking withdrawal from the Court.
- Procedural or substantive suitability: Smaller benches can be perceived as more manageable or faster; specialised chambers could, in theory, concentrate technical expertise (for instance, environmental or maritime disputes).
- Confidence building and access: The option of chambers can lower the political cost of submitting disputes to adjudication, thereby increasing states’ willingness to litigate and strengthening the role of adjudication in international dispute settlement.

Costs and normative trade‑offs
- Representativeness and legitimacy: A smaller panel — particularly one whose composition is tailored to the parties’ preferences — risks being viewed as less representative of the Court’s global diversity. For a rising power such as India, the perceived impartiality and legitimacy of the forum affects domestic political acceptability of international outcomes and the persuasive force of any adverse ruling.
- Fragmentation and consistency: Chamber judgments may carry less moral and doctrinal authority than full‑Court decisions. Because Article 59 already limits formal binding effect, the reduced pool of judicial perspectives in chambers can narrow the deliberative development of universal international law and increase the risk of divergent interpretations across cases.
- Precedential weight and strategic use: Parties may prefer chambers to secure an outcome tailored to their preferences, but proliferating chamber decisions could undercut the uniformity of international law. Conversely, the availability of chambers may draw disputes into litigation that otherwise would remain unresolved, increasing the body of adjudicated law even if unevenly developed.

Empirical observations and examples
- Ad hoc chambers have seen more practical use than the specialised environmental chamber conceived in 1993, which remains unused — a fact that highlights political and procedural barriers to creating specialised fora even where technical subject‑matter specialization seems desirable.
- The Gulf of Maine case (Canada/United States) is often cited as an example where a chamber was used because the parties sought a bench composition acceptable to both or threatened to withdraw from the Court if forced to accept the full bench.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic calculus in forum choice: When disputes implicate national security, sovereignty, or politically sensitive maritime and boundary questions, India must weigh the gains of international adjudication (legal clarity, international legitimacy, dispute settlement) against the risks of a forum perceived domestically as insufficiently representative or intrusive.
- Use of ad hoc chambers as a bargaining tool: India can use the chamber option to signal willingness to submit to neutral adjudication while retaining influence over composition and expertise — a pragmatic compromise consistent with its preference for managed multilateralism.
- Technical disputes and specialised benches: For complex technical disputes (e.g., maritime delimitation involving scientific evidence), specialised or small chambers could be efficient and attractive. Yet India would need to consider the political costs of fragmenting jurisprudence and losing the stronger persuasive authority of full‑Court pronouncements.
- Safeguarding legitimacy: To mitigate legitimacy concerns, India — when consenting to chambers or proposing their use — should push for transparent selection criteria, regional and legal diversity among judges, and publicly reasoned judgments that situate chamber decisions within broader Court jurisprudence.

Concluding assessment and policy guidance
- The ICJ’s chamber mechanism offers useful flexibility: it can lower barriers to adjudication, accommodate party concerns about composition, and cater to technical case needs. For India, these are pragmatic advantages that can be aligned with a cautious but constructive approach to international law.
- However, chambers entail trade‑offs: they can attenuate the representativeness and doctrinal coherence of international jurisprudence. India’s decision to litigate before a chamber should therefore be strategic — distinguishing between high‑stakes, politically sensitive cases better suited to the moral and persuasive weight of the full Court, and technically complex or bilateral disputes where a chamber’s efficiency and acceptability materially increase the prospect of adjudication and compliance.
- Operational recommendation: when agreeing to or proposing chambers, India should insist on transparent, diversity‑aware selection procedures and robust, well‑reasoned decisions that explicitly engage with full‑Court jurisprudence to minimise risks of fragmentation and to maximise the utility of adjudication for its national security and strategic objectives.

Metadata  
- Document snapshot date: 27 May 2025 (composition as of that date).  
- Table headings used in the source: Name | Nationality | Position | Term began | Term ends.

| Mahmoud Daifallah Hmoud | Jordan | Judge | 2025 | 2027 |
| Philippe Gautier | Belgium | Registrar (administrative head) | 2019 | 2026 |

Structural and procedural features (explanatory notes)
- The ICJ is constituted of 15 judges; the table above lists the full complement plus the Registrar (the Registrar is not a judge but the Court’s senior administrator). The count in the snapshot matches the Statute of the Court.
- Judges are elected for nine‑year terms and may be re‑elected. Terms are staggered so that roughly one‑third of the Court (five seats) is contested approximately every three years; this explains the clustering of term‑end years in 2027, 2030 and 2033.
- The President and Vice‑President are elected from among the sitting judges for limited internal terms (commonly three years). These are administrative and procedural offices within the Court; holding such an office does not change a judge’s independent status.
- The Registrar is appointed by the Court (not elected by the UN organs) and manages administration, the registry of cases, and the Court’s non‑judicial functions. Registrar terms and appointment modalities differ from the nine‑year judicial cycle.
- ICJ judges sit in their individual capacity under the Statute of the Court. Their nationalities are listed for identification but do not make them representatives of their states; nevertheless, nationality matters politically in UN elections and in perceptions of geographic balance.
- Elections of judges are conducted concurrently and independently by the UN General Assembly and the Security Council; a candidate must secure an absolute majority in both organs.

Observations from the 27 May 2025 snapshot (interpretive points)
- Continuity and re‑election are visible: several judges (e.g., Peter Tomka) have long service histories, illustrating that re‑election is a common path to extended tenure and institutional memory on the bench.
- The 2024 cohort (five judges with terms to 2033) reflects a recent election cycle. New entrants and replacements can alter the Court’s expertise mix and jurisprudential dynamics.
- Short remainder terms occur: Mahmoud Daifallah Hmoud’s 2025–2027 term indicates he filled a remainder vacancy rather than receiving a fresh nine‑year mandate. Such partial terms follow resignations, deaths, or other vacancies and are completed at the next regular election for that seat.
- Internal changes can be rapid: the source contains a footnote that ICJ President Nawaf Salam resigned to assume Lebanon’s premiership and Yuji Iwasawa was subsequently elected President to fill the vacancy — an example of how external political developments can prompt internal Court reconfigurations.
- Editorial caution: the original table text showed typographical artefacts (e.g., 'Presidentab' and 'Vice‑presidenta'), suggesting that primary documents should be checked for transcription errors when used for scholarship or diplomacy.
- The Registrar’s appointment cadence (2019–2026 in the snapshot) is separate from judicial cycles; researchers should note this when tracing administrative continuity.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s presence on the bench (Judge Dalveer Bhandari, term to 2027) is an asset for Indian legal diplomacy. A sitting Indian judge affords New Delhi improved channels for understanding Court practice, shaping the normative environment in which international legal disputes are adjudicated, and projecting legal influence on matters implicating Indian interests.
- Strategic timing: the grouped term expiries (notably 2027, 2030) are predictable moments for diplomatic campaigning. India’s long‑term candidacies for ICJ judgeships should be planned around these cycles — both to defend an incumbent’s re‑election prospects and to prepare candidatures for open seats.
- Casework and voting patterns: scholars and policy planners should account for institutional roles (President/Vice‑President) and judges’ jurisprudential backgrounds when assessing likely Court behavior in cases relevant to India — e.g., boundary, maritime, state immunity, consular, or treaty interpretation disputes.
- Perception and regional balance: while seats are not formally allocated by region, UN practice tends to favor geographic diversity. India’s diplomatic efforts can leverage regional coalitions (e.g., Asia‑Pacific, the Global South) in support of candidates, but must also be mindful that nationality is a political fact even if legally irrelevant to a judge’s decision‑making.
- Contingency planning: because the Court’s composition can change between reporting dates (resignations, appointments, special elections), Indian strategic planning that relies on the Court — whether for litigation, advisory opinions, or normative influence — must include contingencies for sudden personnel changes.

Notes, caveats and recommended verification
- The roster above is a snapshot as at 27 May 2025. The ICJ’s composition can and does change; always verify against the ICJ/UN official roster for the date of use.
- The presence of footnotes in primary sources (for example, recording a resignation or special election) is important for tracing the provenance of particular seat changes — consult original UN/ICJ press releases for authoritative accounts.
- For academic or policy work that depends on precise dates (election cycles, term expiries) cross‑check the beginning/end dates, and where relevant examine whether listed start years reflect first election dates or re‑elections.

Short bibliographic-style annotation for researchers
- For up-to-date membership lists, presidential or registrar changes, and the procedural rules governing elections, consult the ICJ website and relevant UN General Assembly and Security Council records. These primary sources are essential for rigorous scholarship on how ICJ composition intersects with state strategy and legal diplomacy.

28. Yuji Iwasawa — 2025–2027 — Japan (recorded/scheduled)

Key institutional facts and patterns (derived from the register)
- Term length and election: Presidential terms are commonly three years; the President is elected by their fellow ICJ judges from among sitting members. The dataset shows some shorter or shifted spans reflecting election timing, mid‑term succession, or transitional arrangements.  
- Core functions of the President: preside over hearings, direct internal Court administration, represent the Court in external relations, and formally sign judgments and orders. The President thereby exercises both procedural and symbolic authority within the Court.  
- Geographic breadth and diversity: The sequence shows representation from Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. This geographic spread supports the ICJ’s claim to universality and helps sustain legitimacy among states of differing legal traditions.  
- Frequency of presidencies by country (noting institutional careers rather than national dominance): United Kingdom (4), France (3), United States (3), Poland (2), Japan (2); several other countries appear once. Multiple presidencies for certain countries reflect the international prominence of jurists from those systems and the historical strength of particular legal traditions in ICJ staffing.  
- Profile of office‑holders: Presidents have typically been eminent jurists and/or statesmen—former diplomats, professors of international law, or long‑serving international judges—whose authority rests on professional stature as much as nationality.

Analytical observations and implications for India’s strategic culture
- Visibility and credibility matter. The Presidency of Nagendra Singh (1985–1988) stands out as a moment of clear Indian visibility at the highest level of international adjudication. For Indian strategic culture—characterized by a preference for pluralist multilateralism, legalist engagement when politically acceptable, and guarded sovereignty—the election of an Indian judge to the ICJ Presidency bolsters claims of normative competence and shapes New Delhi’s willingness to invoke international law in diplomatic and security arenas.  
- Legitimacy through representation. The ICJ’s leadership rotation across regions helps sustain the Court’s perceived neutrality. For India, the Court’s geographic inclusiveness and the occurrence of Global‑South presidencies (e.g., Taslim Elias of Nigeria; Abdulqawi Yusuf of Somalia; Mohammed Bedjaoui of Algeria) create an environment where developing states can perceive the Court as less Western‑centric—this perception can make adjudication a more attractive option for dispute settlement or normative contestation.  
- Continuity and jurisprudential influence. Several Presidents were central actors in major ICJ decisions; thus presidencies mark periods in which particular juristic outlooks can shape procedural emphases and Court representation. India’s policymakers and legal community monitor these cycles because sustained jurisprudential trends (on state immunity, use of force, maritime delimitation, etc.) affect India’s legal strategies and contingency planning.  
- Strategic caution and selective engagement. India’s strategic culture combines respect for legal principles with prudence about international adjudication. The presence of Indian jurists in leadership roles does not automatically translate into an aggressive reliance on the Court, but it does provide India with authoritative interpretive resources and confidence when choosing judicial avenues.  
- Research utility. This list is useful for historians, legal scholars, and policy analysts tracing how leadership composition at the ICJ correlates with shifts in international legal reasoning that, in turn, influence state behaviour and national security doctrines.

Caveats and suggestions for further use
- The register includes entries marked as recorded/scheduled beyond 2024; these should be treated as forward projections or the result of Court elections and subject to later confirmation and context.  
- For deeper analytical work, augment this register with: election dates, the judges’ full biographies and legal philosophies, major ICJ decisions rendered during each presidency, and contemporaneous political contexts (Cold War, decolonization, post‑Cold War era). Such augmentation will permit fine‑grained assessment of how presidential leadership affected institutional priorities and how those priorities intersected with India’s external legal and security choices.

Concluding note
This compact chronology is not merely a list of names and dates: it is a map of institutional leadership that matters for how international law is produced, presented, and consumed by states. For India—whose strategic culture balances legal engagement and sovereignty concerns—the composition and leadership of the ICJ are consequential variables shaping opportunities and constraints in legal diplomacy, treaty practice, and the adjudicative settlement of disputes.

### 4.X States, the ICJ Statute and Jurisdiction: Article 93 in Context

This section explains how states become parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) under Article 93 of the UN Charter, and the important legal distinction between party status and the Court’s jurisdiction. Though brief, the discussion foregrounds issues that matter for a study of national strategic culture (including India’s): access to multilateral dispute settlement, the centrality of state consent, and the institutional mechanisms that permit—yet limit—recourse to the world’s principal judicial organ.

- Article 93(1) — automatic party status for UN members
  - By operation of Article 93(1) of the UN Charter, every member of the United Nations is a party to the Statute of the ICJ. In practical terms this means that the 193 UN member states are automatically included among the Statute’s parties and thereby have the formal entitlement to invoke the Court’s procedures.
  - For states such as India, automatic party status secures institutional access to the ICJ as a forum; it does not, however, by itself establish the jurisdiction necessary for the Court to decide disputes involving the state (see below).

- Article 93(2) — access for non-UN states
  - Article 93(2) provides that states which are not UN members may also be admitted to the ICJ Statute. Admission under this provision is subject to conditions determined by the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Security Council.
  - The Article 93(2) procedure thus gives non-members a route to become parties to the Statute before (or without) UN membership, preserving flexibility in access to the Court while retaining a gatekeeping role for the principal UN organs.

- Historical examples of Article 93(2) use
  - Switzerland (1948): became a party to the ICJ Statute prior to joining the United Nations through the Article 93(2) procedure.
  - Nauru (1988): likewise used Article 93(2) before becoming a UN member.
  - These cases illustrate the Article’s practical role: enabling states outside the UN’s membership until a given moment to secure statutory access to the ICJ.

- Party status versus jurisdiction: a fundamental distinction
  - Being a party to the ICJ Statute is a necessary precondition for a state’s participation in proceedings, but it is not sufficient to confer the Court with jurisdiction in disputes involving that state.
  - Jurisdiction is a separate legal question governed by different rules and consent requirements. The Court may only hear a contentious dispute if a recognised legal basis for jurisdiction exists; without such a basis the Court has no authority to decide the merits between the parties.

- Three principal categories of ICJ proceedings and their jurisdictional bases
  - Contentious cases
    - These are disputes between states which the Court may decide only where it has jurisdiction founded on the consent of the states concerned.
    - Consent may be given in a variety of ways: by a compromissory clause in a treaty, by a special agreement (submission ad hoc) between the parties, by a unilateral declaration accepting the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction (commonly called the “optional clause” under Article 36(2) of the Statute), or by other forms of ad hoc consent.
    - Because consent is central, contentious jurisdiction reflects states’ sovereignty and choices about dispute resolution—an important theme in national strategic cultures that value autonomy in security and legal affairs.
  - Incidental jurisdiction
    - The Court may exercise jurisdiction over incidental matters that arise in the course of a main contentious proceeding (for example, counterclaims, preliminary questions, or issues of interpretation essential to resolving the principal dispute).
    - Incidental jurisdiction is derivative: its scope depends on the subject-matter of the principal case and the legal relationship between the incidental claim and the main proceedings.
  - Advisory opinions
    - Under its advisory function the ICJ provides non‑binding legal opinions at the request of certain UN organs and specialised agencies.
    - Advisory proceedings do not require state consent in the same way as contentious cases; rather, they are founded on the Charter and on the statutes or enabling instruments that allow specified UN organs and agencies to request the Court’s opinion.
    - Advisory opinions are persuasive legal instruments but are not enforceable judgments between states.

- Legal and practical implications for states’ strategic choices
  - The separation between party status and jurisdiction imposes a deliberate constraint: states may be formally entitled to approach the Court, yet whether a dispute can be adjudicated depends on prior or contemporaneous legal bases for jurisdiction—most often, the consent of the states involved.
  - For states with a cautious approach to external adjudication—whether for reasons of sovereignty, strategic autonomy, or concerns about binding dispute resolution—this regime preserves choice. For other states, treaty practice or unilateral acceptance of jurisdiction can create avenues for compulsory judicial settlement.
  - Article 93(2)’s admission mechanism illustrates the UN system’s balancing act: widening access to the ICJ while retaining institutional control through the General Assembly and Security Council.

Key conclusions
- Party status to the ICJ Statute (automatic for UN members under Article 93(1) or by special admission under Article 93(2)) is necessary to participate in ICJ proceedings but is not sufficient to establish the Court’s jurisdiction in disputes.
- Jurisdictional competence depends on distinct legal foundations that vary by case type: consent-based bases for contentious cases, derivative bases for incidental questions, and Charter-based requester authority for advisory opinions.
- Article 93(2) provides a flexible, politically mediated path for non-members to gain access to the Court, preserving both inclusiveness and the prerogatives of UN organs.

Short note on relevance to India’s strategic culture
- As a UN member, India is a party to the ICJ Statute; but, as with other states, India’s strategic calculations about when to litigate before the Court will turn on the separate question of jurisdiction and on broader considerations about sovereignty, dispute-settlement strategy, and the political costs and benefits of legal adjudication. The ICJ regime thus dovetails with the recurrent theme in Indian foreign and security policy: balancing engagement with international institutions against the preservation of autonomous decision-making.

## Chapter X — The International Court of Justice and Contentious Jurisdiction

Opening note
- The public provenance of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is visible in early post‑war footage — a 1946 Dutch newsreel of the first gatherings — and the Court’s institutional life since then helps explain how modern interstate adjudication was reconstituted after World War II. Central to the ICJ’s role are its contentious cases: adversarial proceedings in which consenting states submit a dispute and receive a binding judicial ruling.

Nature and parties in contentious cases
- Contentious cases are strictly interstate proceedings. Only sovereign states may be parties; individuals, corporations, sub‑national units, non‑governmental organizations, United Nations organs, and self‑determination groups are excluded from direct participation.  
- That exclusion is not absolute in effect: the ICJ will receive material from public international organizations and other entities as evidence or amicus information, and non‑state interests can be litigated indirectly when a state brings a claim on their behalf (for example, diplomatic protection claims for injured nationals or injured corporations).

Binding effect and enforcement
- ICJ judgments are binding only between the parties and only with respect to the particular case. The Court has no police to enforce its decisions. Article 94 of the UN Charter contemplates Security Council measures to address non‑compliance, but political and diplomatic mechanisms remain the principal means by which judgments are implemented.  
- The Court can indicate provisional measures to preserve the parties’ rights pending final decision; these measures are legally significant and frequently influential in practice, but they too depend on political mechanisms for enforcement.

Jurisdictional fundamentals: consent and its forms
- The fundamental principle is simple and decisive: the ICJ’s jurisdiction is founded on the consent of states. Jurisdictional questions are often the principal preliminary issue in contentious cases. Article 36 of the Statute of the Court sets out the principal bases through which states may consent to jurisdiction. Four main bases arise from Article 36, augmented by historic carry‑over rules and doctrines of tacit consent.

1) Compromis (special agreement)
- A compromis is an explicit, case‑specific agreement by the parties to submit a particular dispute to the Court. Because it is express and tailored to the specific conflict, a compromis often proves effective: parties who negotiate a compromis typically have a clear interest in a definitive judicial settlement and may be more disposed to comply with the resulting judgment.

2) Compromissory clauses (treaty jurisdiction)
- Many treaties contain compromissory clauses that submit disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the treaty to the ICJ. Such clauses were a frequent vehicle for jurisdiction in earlier decades.  
- In practice these clauses can be less effective in securing compliance: a state may lack sufficient interest in cooperating, may decline participation, or may interpret the treaty scope narrowly. A historic illustration is the case arising from the 1961 Iran hostage crisis: Iran relied on a Vienna Convention compromissory clause as a basis for a claim, yet refused to participate and later declined to comply with certain judicial processes and outcomes.  
- Since the 1970s states have increasingly preferred alternative mechanisms (notably arbitration and specialized dispute‑settlement procedures) to treaty compromissory clauses. Modern treaty practice commonly substitutes flexible, party‑designed systems for automatic recourse to the ICJ.

3) Optional clause declarations (Article 36(2))
- Under Article 36(2) a state may make a unilateral declaration accepting the Court’s jurisdiction as compulsory (the so‑called “optional clause”). Despite the label “compulsory” in some older commentary, such declarations remain wholly voluntary and may be qualified by reservations.  
- Declarations commonly exclude categories of disputes (ratione materiae) — for example, territorial disputes, disputes concerning military matters, or matters covered by previous treaties — and many declarations operate on the basis of reciprocity (i.e., the Court will hear cases only against states that have similarly accepted jurisdiction). These reservations and reciprocity conditions restrict predictability and ease of use.  
- Statistics (as cited): by January 2018, 74 states had optional‑acceptance declarations in force (up from 66 in February 2011). Among the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, only the United Kingdom retained such a declaration at that cited time. The pattern of declarations has shifted: early adopters were predominantly industrialized states; following the Court’s seminal case law (notably Nicaragua v. United States, 1986) more developing states have made declarations. Some states have narrowed or withdrawn declarations after being subject to adjudication — for instance, after being sued in the ICJ the United States limited its position in the aftermath of Nicaragua; Australia in 2002 excluded maritime boundary disputes from its declaration.

4) PCIJ transfers and Article 36(5) / Article 37
- Historical carryovers persist: Article 36(5) of the ICJ Statute recognizes jurisdictional declarations made under the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ), and Article 37 enables the transfer of compromissory clauses from predecessor instruments. These provisions preserve older bases of consent where they continue to be invoked.

Tacit consent (forum prorogatum)
- Beyond express bases, jurisdiction can sometimes arise through tacit consent (forum prorogatum). If the respondent state accepts the Court’s jurisdiction explicitly after the application has been filed, or if it participates in the proceedings in a way that waives its objection (for example, by pleading on the merits), the Court may hold that the state has consented.  
- The Corfu Channel Case (United Kingdom v. Albania, 1949) offers a classic example: a letter from Albania acknowledging the Court’s jurisdiction was treated as sufficient to found jurisdiction by conduct.

Distinctive features and related procedures
- Advisory proceedings are separate from contentious cases: UN organs and specialized agencies may request non‑binding advisory opinions from the Court. These opinions differ procedurally and in effect from contentious, binding judgments between states.  
- Diplomatic protection remains an important route for addressing injuries to nationals or corporate entities: a state may lodge a claim on behalf of its national, but such claims are subject to international law constraints (for example, requirements to exhaust local remedies where applicable) and remain discretionary acts of the representing state.

Implications for states and for international law
- Sovereignty and strategy: because the Court’s jurisdiction is grounded in consent, states make strategic choices about when and how to accept judicial settlement. Acceptance is a sovereign act shaped by considerations of reciprocity, political sensitivity, and enforcement prospects.  
- Fragmentation of dispute settlement: the decline in treaty compromissory clauses and the rise of arbitration and tailored dispute‑settlement mechanisms reflect a broader preference among states for flexible, controllable procedures rather than automatic resort to the ICJ.  
- Access for non‑state actors: the restriction of direct access to states means individuals, corporations, and civil society must rely on states to take up their claims. This dynamic shapes the politics of transnational litigation and often limits direct judicial remedies for non‑state harms.  
- Predictability limits: reservations and reciprocity in optional declarations, plus ad hoc narrowings of jurisdiction after adverse cases, reduce the predictability and universality of compulsory jurisdiction.  
- Compliance and power politics: the Court’s lack of a direct enforcement mechanism means that diplomatic pressure, political leverage, and the Security Council can be decisive in securing compliance. This reality tempers the purely legal character of dispute settlement before the ICJ.

Key terms (concise)
- Contentious cases: adversarial interstate disputes before the ICJ that produce binding judgments between consenting states.  
- Compromis (special agreement): an express, case‑specific submission of a dispute to the Court.  
- Compromissory clause: a treaty provision submitting disputes under that treaty to the ICJ.  
- Optional clause (Article 36(2)): a unilateral declaration accepting the Court’s jurisdiction generally, often with reservations.  
- Forum prorogatum: tacit consent to jurisdiction, typically inferred from conduct such as pleading on the merits.  
- PCIJ transfer (Articles 36(5) & 37): carryover of jurisdictional bases from the Permanent Court of International Justice.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- The ICJ’s consent‑based system resonates strongly with strategic concerns of sovereignty and autonomous dispute resolution that are salient in India’s security calculus. Indian policymakers weigh the costs and benefits of judicial settlement in light of reciprocity, political objectives, and enforceability.  
- The shifting treaty practice away from automatic compromissory clauses toward arbitration and specialized mechanisms offers India greater flexibility to design dispute processes compatible with its strategic interests. At the same time, the limited direct access of non‑state actors to the ICJ means India controls avenues for diplomatic protection and the internationalization of disputes involving its nationals and firms.  
- Finally, because the ICJ’s effectiveness depends on compliance and geopolitics as much as on legal reasoning, Indian strategic doctrine is likely to treat judicial avenues as part of a broader toolkit — useful for legitimacy and legal clarity, but deployed alongside diplomacy, regional arrangements, and, where relevant, coercive instruments.

Concluding remark
- The ICJ’s contentious jurisdiction is a structured but ultimately consent‑driven system. Understanding its bases, limitations, and political ecology is essential for states in designing dispute‑settlement strategies and for analysts assessing how judicial avenues fit into the broader architecture of international order — a point of particular relevance for states such as India, which calibrate legal engagement against strategic imperatives.

### Interim (Provisional) Measures at the International Court of Justice:
legal basis, practice and implications for strategic actors

Interim measures (also called provisional measures) are a distinctive procedural tool of the International Court of Justice (ICJ). They allow the Court, pending its final judgment, to order steps intended to preserve the rights of a party and prevent irreparable prejudice. For a state whose strategic culture places high value on sovereignty and security—such as India—understanding the contours, limits and practical effects of provisional measures is essential when deciding whether and how to engage the Court in disputes touching on national security or core interests.

Legal basis and character
- Article 41 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice is the explicit legal basis for provisional measures. The provision empowers the Court to “indicate” measures it considers necessary to preserve the respective rights of either party.
- The Court’s power to indicate provisional measures is an exercise of incidental (ancillary) jurisdiction: it is ancillary to the Court’s substantive jurisdiction over the merits of the dispute and exists to ensure that a final decision will not be rendered ineffective by irreparable acts or changes of circumstance.
- Orders for provisional measures are described in the Court’s practice as binding on the parties, just as its final judgments are. In practice, however, their legal and political force depends on state compliance and available enforcement mechanisms.

Who may apply; the mutual or unilateral application
- Either party to a case before the Court may apply for provisional measures. In some disputes both parties have made concurrent applications—illustratively, in the Frontier Dispute between Burkina Faso and Mali each party submitted requests for interim measures.
- The Court may also on its own motion indicate provisional measures in exceptional circumstances, but typical practice is that a party brings the request.

Prima facie jurisdiction: threshold for action
- Before indicating provisional measures the ICJ requires that its jurisdiction over the dispute be at least prima facie satisfied. This does not mean a full merits determination; rather the Court must be reasonably satisfied that a plausible basis for jurisdiction exists.
- The “prima facie” threshold is deliberately lower and quicker than the scrutiny applied at the merits phase: it balances the need for urgency with the judicial obligation not to exceed the Court’s jurisdiction.
- Where secondary sources flag “citation needed”, scholars and practitioners should consult the Court’s jurisprudence (and leading doctrine) to see how that threshold has been articulated in concrete cases.

Purpose, scope and limits
- Provisional measures aim to prevent irreparable prejudice to rights alleged by the applicant and to preserve the status quo pending the Court’s final decision. They are protective, not adjudicative: they do not resolve the merits.
- The measures must be proportionate and tailored to the risk of irreparable harm. They may require a state to refrain from an action, to take positive steps, or to adopt interim procedures (for example, preserving evidence or permitting consular access).
- The Court will decline to indicate measures if the applicant cannot show urgency or risk of irreparable prejudice, if measures would be ineffectual, or if a requested order would effectively prejudge the merits.

Procedure and speed
- The ICJ can act quickly. The Court may issue provisional measures on written requests, after brief hearings, or in hurried oral proceedings when urgency dictates. The procedural flexibility is intended to meet genuinely time-sensitive situations.
- Familiar examples where the Court has used provisional measures include cases such as LaGrand and Avena, where consular-rights and human-rights concerns required swift intervention to avoid irreparable prejudice to individuals facing penalties.

Binding nature and enforcement: theory and practice
- Formally, provisional-measure orders are binding, but their practical enforcement depends on state compliance and on political mechanisms. The ICJ has no police force; if a state fails to comply, the primary remedies are legal, diplomatic and political.
- Under the UN Charter, persistent non‑compliance with an ICJ judgment may be addressed by the Security Council (Article 94), but recourse to the Security Council is a political process and may be blocked or complicated by the veto or by broader strategic alignments.
- Consequently, provisional measures often rely on the state’s interest in maintaining international reputation, reciprocal relations, and other diplomatic pressures; where those levers are weak, practical effectiveness is uncertain.

Examples and doctrinal guidance
- The Court’s provisional-measures jurisprudence (e.g., LaGrand, Avena, and the Frontier Dispute) illustrates recurrent themes: urgency, irreparability, the prima facie jurisdiction test, and the protective (non‑decisive) character of measures.
- These cases also show that provisional measures have been used in both individual-rights contexts (consular access, protection of persons) and inter‑state contexts (border disputes, threats to territory or population).

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For a state with a strategic culture that emphasizes sovereignty, prudence and calibrated international engagement, provisional measures present both opportunity and risk. They can preserve vital facts on the ground while a long adjudicative process proceeds, but invoking the Court or complying with an order may have political costs or be perceived domestically as external interference.
- Decision-makers must weigh: the legal protection provisional measures can offer against the limited practical enforcement options; the reputational and diplomatic advantages of compliance against domestic political sensitivities; and the threshold of “prima facie” jurisdiction against the risk of having the Court decline to act.
- Where national security or territorial integrity is at stake, states may prefer bilateral arbitration, on‑site confidence‑building measures, or diplomatic channels; yet provisional measures can be an effective tool when the risk of irreparable harm is acute and rapid legal protection is needed.

Concluding note on sources and precision
- Statements about the Court’s requirements (for example, the meaning of “prima facie jurisdiction”) should be checked against primary ICJ decisions and authoritative doctrine. When a source flags “citation needed,” consult the Court’s jurisprudence (notably the provisional-measures orders and subsequent reasoning in LaGrand, Avena, Frontier Dispute, and related cases) to ensure precise formulation of the applicable standards.

### Advisory Opinions of the International Court of Justice: Nature, Procedure, Authority and Relevance for Indian Strategic Culture

Introduction
- Advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) are a distinctive judicial technique through which the UN system and certain authorized organs obtain authoritative legal guidance on questions that intersect with their mandates. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, advisory opinions matter because they clarify legal obligations, delimit state practice on sovereignty and use of force, shape obligations on transboundary harms (including climate), and thereby influence both diplomatic strategy and domestic policy-making.

1. What an advisory opinion is (definition and legal source)
- An advisory opinion is a consultative function of the ICJ provided for in the Court’s Statute and the UN Charter. Unlike contentious judgments between states, advisory opinions are solicited by UN organs and specialized agencies to assist them in the exercise of their mandates. The legal authority of those opinions rests on the ICJ’s status as the UN’s principal judicial organ; the Court’s reasoned opinions carry persuasive and normative weight even though they are, in principle, non‑binding.

2. Who may request an advisory opinion
- Under the UN Charter, the UN General Assembly (GA) and the Security Council (SC) may request advisory opinions directly. Other UN organs and specialized agencies may request opinions only if the General Assembly has previously authorized them to do so. This gatekeeping function preserves a link between the request and the UN’s institutional framework and competencies.

3. Scope and limits of requests
- Requests must concern matters within the requesting organ’s competence or activities. The Court often scrutinizes the legal question’s fit with the requester’s mandate, and procedural objections commonly assert that a question is either outside mandate or essentially contentious (i.e., a disguised interstate dispute). The precise phrasing of the request is therefore crucial: narrow, technical questions tend to produce narrow, technical opinions; broad or politically charged questions invite expansive legal reasoning and higher risk of controversy.

4. Participation and procedure
- When seized with a request, the Court decides which states and international organizations may provide “useful information.” It routinely invites written statements and may hold oral hearings. Participation in advisory proceedings is typically broader than in contentious cases: non‑state entities, regional organizations, and specialized agencies may be asked to assist, bringing expertise and factual perspectives that help the Court address complex, cross‑border issues (e.g., environment, human rights, decolonization). In substance and procedure the Court largely follows the same rules it uses for contentious cases, although the ultimate outcome is consultative.

5. Character and legal effect (bindingness and influence)
- Advisory opinions are consultative in character and, by express statutory design, non‑binding as judgments on states. In limited circumstances, however, parties or instruments can confer a binding effect in advance for particular agencies or processes (rare in practice). Despite this formal non‑binding status, advisory opinions exert significant legal force:
  - They are authoritative interpretations of international law that influence state practice.
  - They inform treaty interpretation and are frequently cited by national and international courts.
  - They shape normative developments in emerging fields (e.g., environmental law, human rights).

6. Enforcement and practical impact
- The ICJ lacks direct enforcement mechanisms for advisory opinions. Compliance therefore depends on political will, the moral and legal authority of the Court’s reasoning, follow‑up by UN organs, and the dynamics of international politics. In strategic terms, the value of an advisory opinion often lies less in formal enforcement than in its capacity to reframe debates, legitimize policy, and constrain or enable diplomatic action.

7. Controversies and the politicization risk
- Advisory opinions can become controversial for two related reasons:
  - The question posed may itself be politically charged (for example, questions touching sovereignty or the legality of secession).
  - States or organs may use the advisory procedure tactically as an indirect way to litigate contentious matters that the Court cannot adjudicate in a contentious case without consent.
- Such controversies pose institutional risks: while GA referrals can expand legal clarification, frequent use for sensitive disputes can politicize the Court and strain its role as an impartial judicial body.

8. Representative examples
- Nuclear Weapons (1996): A long‑cited advisory opinion dealing with the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. It illustrates how the Court can address questions of humanitarian law and use of force even where the subject is deeply strategic and politically trenchant.
- Accordance with International Law of the Unilateral Declaration of Independence by the Provisional Institutions of Self‑Government of Kosovo (Kosovo advisory): A paradigmatic example of how questions of statehood and secession brought to the Court by a UN organ can generate intense political and legal dispute over the limits of UN competence and the Court’s role in resolving highly sensitive sovereignty questions.
- Climate change advisory (2024–2025): Described as the biggest advisory in ICJ history, the GA requested the Court to address (1) whether States have obligations to protect the climate system from anthropogenic emissions for present and future generations, and (2) the legal consequences where State acts or omissions have caused significant harm to the climate system and environment. The Court—after hearings involving 99 countries and over a dozen intergovernmental organizations (two weeks of hearings in December 2024)—issued an advisory opinion on 23 July 2025. This case exemplifies the Court’s role in clarifying global obligations on transboundary harms and the potential for advisory opinions to shape international environmental governance.

9. Additional procedural and doctrinal points
- Advisory proceedings cannot directly resolve private disputes or decide contentious state‑to‑state cases unless the parties accept the Court’s competence. They do, however, provide broad participation and expertise, enabling the Court to address complex, multi‑disciplinary topics.
- Procedural objections commonly allege the question to be essentially contentious, or that the requesting organ has exceeded its competence.
- The phrasing of a request is strategic: narrower formulations reduce political spillover; broader formulations allow the Court to articulate general principles but at the cost of greater political pushback.

10. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Legal clarity: Advisory opinions help define the limits and content of obligations on use of force, delimitation, recognition/statehood, and environmental protection. For India, such clarifications inform legal framing of strategic choices — for example, maritime claims, obligations concerning transboundary pollution and climate action, and positions on secession or recognition.
- Policy legitimation and constraint: While not binding, advisory opinions provide authoritative legal reasoning that Indian policymakers can invoke domestically and internationally to justify policies or to argue against adversary claims. Conversely, adverse opinions can create normative pressure constraining policy options.
- Diplomacy and multilateral engagement: India’s participation in advisory proceedings (through written submissions or oral statements where invited, and through coalitions in the GA) is an instrument of legal diplomacy. High‑profile advisory opinions—like the climate case—shape negotiation agendas, treaty drafting, and reputational considerations that feed back into India’s strategic decision‑making.
- Institutional caution: Given the risk of politicization, India’s strategic culture may prefer selective engagement: supporting advisory avenues when legal clarification aids national interests (e.g., environmental obligations that legitimize domestic action) while cautioning against the use of advisory requests to settle bilateral or highly contentious disputes indirectly.

Concise summary
- Advisory opinions are a consultative but influential instrument of the ICJ: they are requested by authorized UN organs, subject to participation by a wide set of actors, procedurally similar to contentious proceedings, formally non‑binding but legally persuasive, and politically consequential. Landmark opinions (Nuclear Weapons, Kosovo, and the 2024–2025 climate advisory) illustrate their capacity to clarify complex legal questions and to shape international and national policy. For India, advisory opinions are an important legal‑diplomatic resource that can legitimize policy, inform treaty and domestic law interpretation, and influence strategic choices—provided New Delhi calibrates its engagement to both protect legal interests and avoid politicization of the Court.

### International Court of Justice — Select contentious cases and their lessons for strategic policy

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations for the peaceful settlement of disputes between states. Its docket of contentious cases — state v. state litigation — provides a window into how international law interacts with questions that are central to national security: protection of nationals abroad, maritime boundaries and resources, the use of force, questions of sovereignty and jurisdiction, and the effectiveness of provisional measures. Below I summarize a set of representative ICJ cases, identify the legal themes they exemplify, and draw concise lessons relevant to Indian strategic culture and national-security decision-making.

Cases (brief description and legal core)

- United States v. Iran (1980) — “United States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran.”  
  Core issue: violation of obligations to protect diplomatic personnel and premises (the 1979–80 hostage crisis). The case illustrates the Court’s role in vindicating diplomatic protection obligations and ordering urgent relief where diplomatic immunity and personal safety are at stake.

- Tunisia v. Libya (1982) — continental shelf delimitation dispute.  
  Core issue: maritime boundary and resource rights. Shows the ICJ’s technical work in maritime delimitation and its mix of legal principle and fact‑intensive inquiry (coastline geometry, relevant circumstances, equity).

- Iran v. United States (1989) — complaint concerning the downing of Iran Air Flight 655.  
  Core issue: responsibility for the loss of a civilian aircraft; questions of wrongful use of force and state responsibility. The case highlights difficulties in attributing responsibility and proving wrongful conduct in complex operational contexts.

- United States v. Canada (Gulf of Maine, 1984) — maritime boundary delimitation.  
  Core issue: delimitation affecting jurisdiction and access to marine resources. An example of the Court applying delimitation techniques (equidistance/modification) with significant economic and jurisdictional consequences.

- Federal Republic of Yugoslavia v. Netherlands & other NATO states (filed 1999) — challenge to NATO actions in Kosovo.  
  Outcome: application dismissed (15 Dec 2004) for lack of jurisdiction because the FRY was not, at the relevant time, a party to the ICJ Statute in the form asserted. This underscores jurisdictional preconditions and their decisive effect on whether the Court can entertain a politically charged claim.

- Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda (2005) — allegations of sovereignty violations and resource exploitation.  
  Outcome: decided in favour of the DRC. The Court found unlawful use of force and occupation and ordered remedies. Illustrates the Court’s capacity to find state responsibility for serious breaches and to order reparations — albeit reliant on states’ willingness to comply.

- Republic of North Macedonia v. Greece (2011) — dispute under the 1995 Interim Accord (name dispute and related measures).  
  Outcome: ICJ found Greece had violated the Interim Accord by blocking Macedonia’s NATO accession; decision (5 Dec 2011) vindicated treaty obligations and the limits on unilateral measures affecting third‑party processes.

- India v. Pakistan (initiated 2017) — Kulbhushan Jadhav case.  
  Core issue: consular access and rights under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations arising from a military court conviction and death sentence imposed on an Indian national accused of espionage. The case underlines the role of the Court in protecting consular rights and the wider diplomatic-protection function.

- Ukraine v. Russia (2022) — challenge under the Genocide Convention and request for provisional measures.  
  Core issues: treaty interpretation (1948 Genocide Convention), alleged misuse of the Convention as pretext for force, and urgent provisional measures to prevent acts alleged to constitute genocide. The ICJ ordered provisional measures (16 March 2022) by a 13–2 vote directing Russia to suspend military operations in Ukraine; Russia largely refused to participate and ignored the order. This case powerfully demonstrates the limits of judicial remedies when confronted with determined non‑compliance by a major power.

Cross‑cutting legal themes and institutional characteristics

- Types of outcomes: merits judgments, orders for provisional measures, or dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Each has different legal force and political impact. Provisional measures are issued rapidly to prevent irreparable harm but are not self‑enforcing.

- Jurisdictional constraint: jurisdiction is often the decisive threshold issue. The ICJ’s competence depends on consent (treaty clauses, compromis, declarations under Article 36, or special agreements). Cases are frequently won or lost at the jurisdiction stage (FRY/NATO example).

- Provisional measures: the Court can and does order urgent relief (Ukraine v. Russia). Such measures are legally binding in principle but rely entirely on state compliance or political enforcement mechanisms (UN Security Council), which may be blocked or ignored.

- Non‑participation by respondents: a state may refuse to appear (e.g., Russia) — that does not automatically bar the Court from proceeding and issuing orders. Non‑appearance affects evidence, the ability to implement judgments, and the political dynamics of enforcement.

- Enforcement gap: the ICJ has no standing enforcement apparatus. Compliance depends on the defendant state’s willingness, diplomatic pressure, or Security Council action. Political realities and power asymmetries often determine whether judicial victory translates into practical redress.

- Factual and legal complexity: many cases require detailed factual reconstruction (chain-of-events, military operations, allocation of coastal entitlements) and technical legal craftsmanship (treaty interpretation, attribution of conduct, standard of proof for serious international crimes). These complexities slow adjudication and make outcomes contingent on evidentiary quality and legal framing.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national‑security policy

- Selective legalism: India’s strategic practice has historically been pragmatic about legal fora. The ICJ’s record shows that international adjudication can be an effective instrument when jurisdiction is secure and a favourable legal rule or precedent can be mobilized — but it is no substitute for coercive or diplomatic capacity when compliance is unlikely. Indian policymakers should therefore view litigation as one tool among many, useful for normative clarification, reputational gains, and protection of nationals (consular issues), but not a guaranteed means of enforcement.

- Consular protection and nationals abroad: the Kulbhushan Jadhav proceedings underscore how the ICJ can vindicate consular rights and generate international pressure in cases involving detained nationals. For India, robust consular practice and readiness to litigate violations of consular conventions are important elements of protecting citizens and projecting resolve.

- Maritime and resource disputes: cases like Tunisia v. Libya and Gulf of Maine show the technical and legal predictability that adjudication can bring to maritime delimitation. For India — with a long coastline, competing maritime claims in the Indian Ocean region, and growing interests in offshore resources — international law and dispute‑settlement mechanisms (including courts or tribunals) can provide durable, legally defensible outcomes where bilateral negotiation is stalled. Yet the choice to litigate will depend on strategic calculus about relations with neighbours and regional institutions.

- Use of force and treaty interpretation: disputes over the lawfulness of force (Iran Air, DRC/Uganda, Ukraine/Russia) reveal that legal adjudication may constrain state behaviour in norms‑sensitive contexts but cannot, by itself, stop determined aggression. India’s strategic planners should integrate legal argumentation into diplomatic strategy (to build coalition pressure and legitimacy) while acknowledging enforcement limits.

- Importance of securing jurisdictional bases: before bringing a claim, India must ensure clear jurisdictional footing — treaty clauses, special agreements, or prior consent mechanisms — because jurisdictional defeat negates any substantive victory. This procedural prudence should inform treaty drafting and bilateral legal commitments.

- Norm‑building and reputational effects: even when enforcement is uncertain, ICJ judgments shape international norms, provide authoritative interpretations (e.g., of the Genocide Convention or consular obligations), and can strengthen India’s voice in multilateral fora. Legal victories can thus enhance normative leverage and public diplomacy.

Conclusion

The ICJ’s contentious docket offers instructive examples of what international adjudication can and cannot do for states confronting security problems. Judicial decisions have real legal and normative weight, clarify obligations, and can vindicate rights (especially diplomatic/consular protections and maritime claims). But their practical impact is bounded by jurisdictional prerequisites, evidentiary complexity, the willingness of respondents to participate, and the absence of direct enforcement tools. For Indian strategic culture, the ICJ is best understood as a complementary instrument: useful for protecting nationals, settling technical disputes, and creating legal momentum — but to be deployed selectively and in concert with diplomatic, political and, where necessary, coercive instruments.

## The Relationship between the International Court of Justice and the UN Security Council

The relationship between the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is a central fault line in contemporary UN law: the ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the UN, empowered to pronounce final, binding decisions in disputes between states; the Security Council is the UN’s political and coercive organ, empowered to adopt enforcement measures for the maintenance of international peace and security. The normative and institutional tensions between legal finality and political coercion shape the effectiveness of international adjudication and have immediate implications for states’ strategic calculations, including those of India as a middle-power actor seeking both juridical remedies and influence within the UN system.

Legal framework and institutional division of labour
- Article 94 of the UN Charter places on UN member states the duty to comply with decisions of the ICJ in cases to which they are parties and explicitly contemplates referral to the Security Council where a party fails to comply.
- Article 103 establishes the supremacy of obligations under the UN Charter: where a conflict exists, Charter obligations prevail over other treaty obligations.
- Chapter VII confers on the Security Council authority to determine threats to international peace and security and to adopt coercive measures (sanctions, use of force authorizations) to address such threats.

How enforcement is supposed to work — and why it often does not
- Formally, ICJ judgments are final and binding on the parties to a contentious case. Article 94 gives the Council a role when a state does not comply: the matter can be brought to the Security Council for action to give effect to the judgment.
- In practice, however, the ICJ lacks independent coercive means. Enforcement therefore depends on (a) the losing state’s willingness to comply, and (b) the political will of the Security Council to take enforcement measures.
- The enforcement route is politically constrained because any substantive enforcement resolution in the Security Council can be blocked by a veto cast by a permanent member (P5). The veto thus creates a structural enforcement gap where a permanent member or its allies are implicated.

Illustrative cases
- Nicaragua v. United States (1986): The ICJ found that the United States had breached obligations in its conduct toward Nicaragua. Nicaragua sought enforcement through the Security Council, but political dynamics in the Council prevented effective enforcement of the Court’s judgment. The case demonstrated how, even when a judgment is clear and final, political obstacles at the Council can frustrate practical compliance. In the aftermath, and in response to the wider political context, the United States withdrew its acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction in the mid-1980s and did not comply with the reparations ordered by the Court.
- Lockerbie / Pan Am (Libya v. United Kingdom and United States): This series of disputes highlights the tension between the Court’s provisional measures function and Security Council-authorized measures. In 1992, the ICJ, by an 11–5 margin, declined to indicate provisional measures to protect Libya’s claimed rights because the measures complained of had been authorized by the Security Council. The Court relied on the primacy of Charter obligations (Article 103) and on the institutional reality that Security Council Chapter VII action can supersede or render ineffective competing treaty-based claims. The application was later declared admissible (1998) and the matter was settled by the parties in 2003 without a merits judgment — another example of a political settlement replacing judicial resolution.

Provisional measures, Article 103, and institutional deference
- Provisional measures are the ICJ’s tool to preserve rights pending final decision. Yet the Court has been cautious where Council action is in play. When a Security Council resolution under Chapter VII creates a direct conflict with provisional relief sought from the Court, the Court has indicated it will not order measures that would collide with or undermine Council action.
- This restraint rests on Article 103 and on a concern to avoid an institutional confrontation that the Court is unlikely to win in practice: the Council enjoys coercive instruments that the Court does not, and the Court’s orders -- if they conflict with Charter-based, Council-authorized measures -- risk being impotent.

Practical implications and strategic consequences
- Enforcement gap: The ICJ provides legal answers, but the lack of autonomous enforcement powers means legal victories can be of limited practical effect; the remedy often depends on political follow‑through.
- Veto politics: The P5 veto can neutralize the Council as an enforcement mechanism against a permanent member or a state protected by a permanent member’s political influence.
- Article 103 supremacy: Where the Security Council has authorized measures under the Charter, those measures can override conflicting treaty-based rights or relief sought before the Court.
- Political settlement as an alternative: In situations where judicial enforcement is blocked or impractical, parties frequently resort to negotiation and settlement — as in the Libya/Lockerbie sequence — thereby substituting diplomacy for adjudication.
- State behaviour: States respond to the enforcement realities. Adverse ICJ rulings can prompt strategic withdrawal from or reservation to the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction; such responses reduce the future efficacy of adjudication as a dispute-resolution tool.
- Alternatives to direct enforcement: States and international actors rely on diplomatic pressure, reputational costs, targeted countermeasures, or regional organisations to secure compliance when the Security Council route is unavailable or blocked.

Broader doctrinal and reform debates
- Scholarship frames the ICJ–UNSC relationship as emblematic of the law–politics divide in international institutions. Key themes are judicial finality versus political discretion, legal obligations versus Charter primacy, and formal compliance versus enforceable implementation.
- Reform proposals that appear in the literature include limiting P5 veto use in situations involving enforcement of ICJ judgments, creating dedicated follow-up or compliance-monitoring mechanisms, and enhancing the role of other UN organs or regional bodies in enforcing judgments. These proposals, however, face deep political obstacles given the P5’s centrality in the Charter design and their entrenched interests.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India — a state that historically proclaims a preference for a rule-based multilateral order while also seeking greater influence within the UN system — the limits of ICJ enforcement and the politics of the Security Council are consequential.
- The ICJ remains an important legal forum for legitimizing claims and shaping international norms; yet Indian strategic actors appreciate the political reality that legal rulings may not translate into coercive outcomes without supportive Security Council dynamics or alternative leverage.
- This ambivalence informs India’s policy posture: support for legal processes and multilateral institutions combined with pragmatic diplomacy, coalitional bargaining, and advocacy for Security Council reform (including, at times, limits on veto use) as part of a wider strategy to reconcile law and power in pursuit of national security objectives.

Concluding observation
The ICJ–UNSC relationship exposes a central tension of the UN system: juridical authority without independent coercive capacity, paired with a political organ (the Council) that can enforce outcomes but is constrained by great‑power politics. The ICJ has sought to preserve its judicial role while avoiding direct institutional collisions with the Council, often deferring in practice when Charter-based, Chapter VII measures are engaged. The resulting enforcement gap and the potential for strategic withdrawals from judicial jurisdiction mean that for states like India, international adjudication is a valuable instrument — but one whose utility is shaped and limited by the political architecture of the Security Council.

## The International Court of Justice: Sources of Law, Precedent, and Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) decides disputes according to the sources of international law enumerated in Article 38 of its Statute. For students of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, an accurate grasp of Article 38 and the Court’s approach to precedent explains how international adjudication shapes state behaviour, legal expectations, and the management of interstate disputes.

### Article 38: The Catalogue of Sources
Article 38(1) provides the authoritative catalogue the ICJ uses to decide cases. It identifies:
- Primary sources:
  - International conventions (treaties) — explicit written agreements among states.
  - International custom — evidence of general practice accepted as law (opinio juris).
  - General principles of law recognized by civilized nations — principles common to major legal systems used to fill gaps.
- Subsidiary (secondary) sources:
  - Judicial decisions — prior court or tribunal rulings.
  - Scholarly writings — “the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists.”

The Article thereby frames a pragmatic hierarchy: treaties and customary law are the principal bases; general principles perform a gap‑filling role; and judicial decisions and doctrine are subsidiary, persuasive sources rather than autonomous sources of binding law.

### Hierarchy in Practice and the Role of Judicial Decisions
Although Article 38 implies a hierarchy, it is not rigid. Practically:
- Treaties and customary rules are treated as primary and decisive when applicable.
- General principles help resolve issues not covered by treaty or custom.
- Prior judicial decisions and scholarly writings serve persuasive functions. The Court routinely consults its own past decisions and those of other tribunals for reasoning, interpretive method, and evidentiary treatment.

Crucially, however, the ICJ is not formally bound by stare decisis. Article 59 states explicitly that the Court’s decisions “have no binding force except between the parties and in respect of that particular case.” This means:
- An ICJ judgment binds only the parties to the dispute and only for that case.
- Past judgments are not legal precedents that automatically determine future cases, although they may be highly persuasive.

Article 38(1)(d) expressly allows the Court to consider prior judicial decisions; the Court frequently does so — following earlier reasoning when it finds the logic and law persuasive — thereby producing de facto consistency without creating a formal precedent system.

When analyzing ICJ jurisprudence, it is analytically useful to distinguish:
- Operative paragraphs (the binding parts of a judgment vis‑à‑vis the parties), and
- The Court’s reasoning (obiter dicta, citations of precedents, evidentiary and interpretive analyses), which carry persuasive authority for future litigation and state practice.

### Ex aequo et bono — Equity as an Optional Basis
Article 38 also contemplates a different approach: parties can confer upon the Court the power to decide ex aequo et bono — that is, to decide according to what is fair and equitable rather than strictly under existing legal rules. Important features:
- Use requires explicit consent from the parties to the particular case.
- The option has never been invoked in the ICJ’s history (to date), reflecting a general state preference for determinate legal rules rather than discretionary equity.
- States typically favour legal predictability, clarity of obligations, and the political legitimacy of rule‑based decisions in matters of national security and territorial disputes — reasons why ex aequo et bono remains unused.

### Practical Consequences for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security
For India, which approaches international law as a tool of statecraft and legitimacy, the ICJ’s approach has several practical implications:
- Predictability vs. Flexibility: Although ICJ judgments are not formally precedent‑binding, the Court’s consistent reasoning enhances predictability in areas such as treaty interpretation and principles of state responsibility — useful for India when assessing legal risks and rights under international law.
- Selective Engagement: Because ICJ jurisdiction depends on consent, India — like other states — retains control over dispute settlement avenues. This shapes strategic decisions about whether to accept compulsory jurisdiction, rely on arbitration, or settle disputes diplomatically.
- Use of Jurisprudence: India may draw on persuasive ICJ reasoning (especially on issues overlapping national security, maritime delimitation, and state responsibility) to bolster legal arguments, diplomatic positions, or to shape domestic policy consistent with emerging international norms.
- Binding Effect and Compliance: The binding effect of ICJ judgments is bilateral. For disputes India is party to, an adverse decision constrains only those parties but creates reputational and normative pressures beyond the litigants that can influence broader strategic calculations.

### Methodological Note and Current Case Count
- The ICJ has handled on the order of a few hundred cases since its founding; counts vary with pending proceedings and new filings. Any specific figure (for example, “about 180 cases”) should be verified against the ICJ’s official records for the date of citation.
- When using ICJ jurisprudence in legal or policy analysis, always distinguish between the legally binding operative findings and the Court’s persuasive reasoning; and check the most recent cases for developments in interpretation, particularly on issues salient to India’s security policy (e.g., maritime law, use of force, state responsibility).

Further reading and frequent consultation of the ICJ website and its recent annual reports will keep analyses current. Understanding how the Court uses Article 38 — together with the practical limits on precedent and the unused ex aequo et bono option — is essential for situating international adjudication within India’s strategic toolkit.

## The International Court of Justice: Procedure and Strategic Implications for India

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is both a legal forum and an institutional actor whose procedures shape how states manage interstate disputes. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the Court’s procedural architecture matters not only as a venue for legal contestation but as a set of temporal, evidentiary and jurisdictional constraints that influence political choices. This section outlines the core procedural features of the Court and highlights their practical significance for Indian strategy.

1. Authority and the Rules of Court
- The ICJ has the authority to adopt and revise its own procedural rules. These are codified in the Rules of Court (originally promulgated in 1978 and subsequently amended, most recently on 29 September 2005).  
- The Rules govern the entire life-cycle of contentious cases: written pleadings, oral hearings, submission and admissibility of evidence, time-limits for filings, registration and formal steps. Amendments typically clarify filing requirements and calendar rules, which can be consequential for states that must reconcile legal strategy with fast-moving political or security developments.

2. The Standard Pattern of Contentious Cases
- Cases normally follow a two-phase structure: a written phase followed by public oral hearings. The written phase is the primary locus for detailed factual and legal argumentation; the oral phase allows parties to present summaries, respond to judges’ questions and to publicize their positions.  
- The written pleadings commonly proceed in an ordered sequence: memorial (applicant), counter‑memorial (respondent), reply and rejoinder. The memorial is the principal initial pleading: it sets out facts, the legal basis of jurisdiction and the merits, and adduces evidence and legal authorities. Subsequent pleadings refine, rebut or expand on those claims.

3. Initiation: Lodging a Case and the Memorial
- A case is initiated when an applicant state seizes the Court and files its memorial. The memorial must articulate the basis on which the Court can exercise jurisdiction (e.g., treaty clause, special agreement, unilateral declaration of acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction) and present the merits with supporting evidence.  
- The respondent may accept jurisdiction and proceed to file its counter‑memorial addressing both jurisdictional questions and merits. Where jurisdiction is contested, the respondent frequently raises preliminary objections.

4. Preliminary Objections and Provisional Measures
- Parties may raise preliminary objections — for example, contesting the Court’s jurisdiction or the admissibility of claims. The ICJ may decide these issues at a preliminary stage, with the result that proceedings on the merits can be stayed or dismissed. The timing and handling of such objections are critical; successful jurisdictional challenges can end litigation before substantive adjudication.  
- In urgent circumstances the Court can indicate provisional (interim) measures to preserve rights or prevent irreparable harm pending final judgment. Provisional measures are often invoked in situations touching on detention of nationals, use of force, or protection of sensitive sites. Though not a panacea, such measures can have immediate practical effects by constraining state action while longer proceedings unfold.

5. Jurisdictional Reality: Consent and Consequences
- ICJ jurisdiction is fundamentally consensual. It rests on express agreements in treaties, special agreements (compromis), or unilateral declarations accepting the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. This consent-based design affects how and when states choose legal adjudication as a tool of policy.  
- The consent requirement combined with the Court’s procedural time‑horizons means that adjudication is often a deliberate, strategic choice — attractive where legal clarity and international legitimacy matter, less so where rapid operational flexibility is required.

6. Advisory Proceedings: A Different Pathway
- Advisory opinions, requested by UN organs or specialized agencies, do not follow the contentious model. They do not involve applicant and respondent states in the same adversarial configuration, and the legal and political stakes (and remedies) differ. Advisory opinions can, however, influence state practice and normative development that bears on security policy.

7. Enforcement, Duration and Strategic Considerations
- ICJ judgments in contentious cases are binding on the parties; yet the Court lacks a direct coercive enforcement mechanism. Compliance relies on states’ willingness, political costs of non‑compliance, and, in some cases, UN Security Council involvement — a path complicated by political vetoes and strategic interests.  
- Proceedings often take several years from filing to final judgment. For national security decision‑makers, this duration reduces the Court’s utility for resolving acute crises but enhances its value for long‑term legal consolidation of positions or for shaping international precedent.

8. Implications for Indian Strategic Culture and Policy
- The procedural character of the ICJ aligns uneasily with certain features of strategic practice. Where India values legal legitimacy and rule‑based norms, recourse to the ICJ can bolster international standing and clarify legal obligations. Where rapid operational response, secrecy or enforcement uncertainty dominates, states may prefer bilateral diplomacy, arbitration with bespoke procedures, or unilateral measures.  
- The memorial-centered written phase rewards thorough legal preparation and evidentiary compilation; states with institutionalized legal capacities can leverage this to present robust, credible claims. The availability of provisional measures is of special relevance where India must protect nationals or critical interests quickly while longer disputes are litigated.  
- Ultimately, India’s strategic posture toward international adjudication will reflect a calculus of legal advantage, domestic politics, alliance considerations and operational timelines. Understanding the ICJ’s procedures — and their limits — is therefore essential for integrating international legal options into comprehensive national security planning.

Conclusion
The ICJ’s procedural regime — Rules of Court, the memorial-centric written phase, preliminary objections, provisional measures, and the consensual nature of jurisdiction — shapes how states can use international adjudication as an instrument of policy. For India, these procedural realities offer both opportunities (legal clarity, legitimacy, provisional protection) and constraints (time, enforcement limits), making procedural literacy a necessary component of strategic legal planning.

## Preliminary objections

Preliminary objections are a distinctive procedural gate in proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ). They permit a respondent state that contests the Court’s competence or the admissibility of the case to seek an early ruling which, if upheld, can dispose of the dispute without the Court ever reaching the merits. For states engaged in complex disputes over national security, sovereignty or treaty obligations—categories that frequently animate India’s strategic concerns—preliminary objections are both a legal safeguard and a strategic tool.

### Legal foundation and the centrality of consent
The ICJ is a consensual court: it exercises jurisdiction only when states have given their consent (by treaty compromissory clauses, special agreement, or optional declarations under Article 36(2) of the Statute). Accordingly, challenges to jurisdiction are among the most common preliminary objections. Objections commonly invoke:
- absence of consent to adjudication;
- lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis (contest over the relevant time period);
- lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae (subject-matter exclusions or treaty reservations);
- the impact of reservations to compromissory clauses.

Admissibility is a closely related but distinct concept. Objections on admissibility can turn on procedural bars (e.g., prior settlement, forum selection), standing (locus standi), or doctrines such as abuse of process. Both jurisdictional and admissibility objections implicate the Court’s power to entertain the dispute at all.

### Typical grounds and doctrinal contours
Important categories of preliminary objection include:
- Jurisdictional objections: arguing the Court lacks authority because the respondent never consented, consent was withdrawn, or the claimed basis (treaty clause, special agreement, optional clause) does not apply to the facts.
- Admissibility objections: arguing the case cannot be heard because it is non-justiciable, has been previously settled, or the applicant lacks a sufficient legal interest.
- Non-joinder or necessary parties: contending that the dispute cannot be resolved justly in the absence of a third state whose rights or obligations would be affected. If adjudication would require ruling on the rights of a non-consenting state, the Court will normally decline to proceed to the merits.

Non-justiciability merits special attention in disputes touching on national security and political questions. The ICJ has in practice treated certain topics as unsuitable for judicial determination where there is no legal dispute or where resolution would require political assessment beyond judicial competence.

### Procedure: hearings, written pleadings, and the separate judgment
When a respondent raises preliminary objections, the Court ordinarily treats them as a distinct preliminary phase. Common features of the process:
- Written phase: parties exchange written pleadings. The standard sequence is: Memorial (applicant), Counter-Memorial (respondent), and often Replies and Rejoinders if the Court orders them.
- Separate hearings: the Court frequently schedules a separate public hearing dedicated to preliminary objections. Those hearings allow oral argument limited to jurisdictional and admissibility issues.
- Separate judgment: the Court will render a judgment on preliminary objections that is legally separate from any later merits judgment. If the Court upholds a preliminary objection in full, the case terminates; if it rejects the objection, the proceedings move on to the merits.

If the Court determines jurisdiction and admissibility, the respondent is then required to file pleadings addressing the merits (a Memorial on the merits, or in practice subsequent written pleadings in the merits phase), and the Court will hold a public hearing on the merits thereafter.

### Provisional measures (indicative preservation of the status quo)
Parties filing cases often request protective relief while proceedings are pending—especially where immediate harm to rights, property, or persons is alleged. The ICJ’s power to indicate provisional (interim) measures is grounded in Article 41 of the Statute of the Court. Provisional measures are functionally analogous to interlocutory injunctions in domestic law, and serve to preserve the respective rights of the parties and prevent irreparable prejudice pending the Court’s final decision.

Key features of provisional measures:
- The Court will normally require prima facie satisfaction of its jurisdiction before indicating provisional measures; it must be plausibly competent to decide the merits.
- The conventional tripartite assessment applied by the Court is: (1) the plausibility of the rights claimed (a plausible legal right), (2) likelihood of irreparable prejudice if measures are not indicated, and (3) urgency (risk that damage will occur before the Court’s final decision).
- Although the legal effect of provisional measures has been the subject of doctrinal debate, the ICJ treats measures it indicates as binding upon the parties—a practice that has important practical consequences for state behavior and for operational security measures.

Provisional measures are thus both a juridical safeguard and a tool of diplomacy: they can freeze a situation to prevent escalation, give parties breathing space for negotiation, or constrain a state’s immediate actions in ways that matter to national-security planners.

### Third-party participation and necessary-joinder considerations
Third-party states with a direct legal interest may apply to intervene under Article 62 of the Statute. Intervention is strictly regulated and permitted only where the intervenor has an interest of a legal nature which may be affected by the decision in the case. Additionally, when the subject matter requires adjudication of rights or obligations of a non-consenting state, the Court will generally find the case inadmissible or decline to exercise jurisdiction. This dynamic is crucial where disputes implicate rights of multiple states (e.g., maritime delimitation or cross-border security operations): the absence of necessary parties can be determinative at the preliminary stage.

### Strategic and practical implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
For a state like India—whose national security policy is attentive to sovereignty, territorial integrity and multilateral dispute settlement—the preliminaries stage at the ICJ has several practical implications:
- Defensive invocation: India or its counterparts may use preliminary objections defensively to protect sovereign prerogatives and foreclose litigation that would require adjudicating the rights of non-consenting third states.
- Procedural delay and issue-limitation: preliminary objections can delay proceedings and narrow the legal issues that reach the merits. Strategically, this can afford time for diplomacy or on-the-ground measures.
- Preserving operational space: seeking or opposing provisional measures can be decisive in preserving the status quo while hostilities or enforcement actions are in play.
- Litigation posture: careful calibration of jurisdictional arguments (e.g., raising ratione temporis or ratione materiae objections) is needed to avoid forfeiting substantive defenses on the merits or creating adverse precedent.
- Inter-state relations: threats to invoke the Court, or to raise preliminary objections, can influence bargaining dynamics without the Court ever issuing a merits judgment.

### Outcome significance and practical sequencing
A ruling sustaining a preliminary objection terminates the case; a ruling rejecting it admits the case to the merits. This binary consequence amplifies the importance of the preliminary phase. Practically, the litigation proceeds along a predictable sequence: initial filing; possible request for provisional measures; written pleadings; preliminary objections and related hearings; if admissible, transition to merits written pleadings and oral hearings; and finally, merits judgment.

Conclusion
Preliminary objections are more than mere procedural technicalities; they are intrinsic to the Court’s identity as a consensual judicial body and are a crucial instrument in the interaction between international adjudication and state practice. For policymakers and legal advisers working on India’s strategic and security policy, mastery of the law and practice of preliminary objections—and of provisional measures—enables informed decisions about whether, when and how to invoke or litigate before the ICJ, and how to align legal strategy with broader diplomatic and security objectives.

### Applications to intervene (ICJ)

Intervention by third states before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is a specialised, narrowly circumscribed procedural mechanism that allows a state whose legal interests would be affected by a judgment to seek participation in a contentious case between other parties. Though rarely used, intervention raises important substantive and strategic questions for states — including India — about when to protect legal interests through litigation, how to manage the binding effects of international adjudication, and how judicial engagement intersects with broader national security and diplomatic objectives.

Statutory basis: Article 62 of the ICJ Statute
- Article 62 provides the sole express statutory route for third‑state intervention in contentious proceedings: a state “which has an interest of a legal nature” that may be affected by the decision may apply to the Court for permission to intervene. The intervention mechanism thus sits within the ICJ’s Statute rather than its Rules as an entrenched, exceptional route to join a case.

“The interest of a legal nature”: narrow interpretation
- The Court has consistently interpreted the statutory phrase “interest of a legal nature” narrowly. Political, diplomatic or purely economic concerns are normally insufficient. The applicant must show a legal interest that is distinct from general or moral concern — for example, a right, obligation, or legal status that could be directly affected by the Court’s decision.
- In practice the Court examines whether the proposed intervenor’s legal interest is such that the judgement could have direct and adverse legal consequences for that state. Mere policy affinity with a party or shared regional interest will not meet the threshold.

Court discretion and the admissibility assessment
- Authorization to intervene is discretionary, not automatic. On an application the Court first determines admissibility under Article 62 and may then define the scope of any permitted intervention. The Court asks whether the applicant’s legal interest is demonstrably linked to the subject‑matter of the dispute and whether intervention would assist the Court’s determination of legal questions.
- Where intervention is permitted, the Court frequently limits interveners’ participation to specific legal points or phases of the proceedings to avoid unduly expanding or complicating the original dispute.

Rarity and historical note
- Intervention applications are uncommon; parties and the Court both approach the device cautiously. The procedural threshold, evidentiary demands, and the Court’s aversion to proliferating parties account for its infrequency. Notably, the first successful intervention under Article 62 occurred only in 1991, underscoring how exceptional such authorizations have been.

Distinction from amicus curiae submissions
- Intervention is distinct from amicus curiae practice. An intervening state, if admitted, participates with rights akin to a party — filing written pleadings, arguing orally, and (subject to Court directions) participating in evidentiary stages on the matters for which it intervenes. By contrast, amicus briefs (or third‑party written opinions) provide advisory assistance without conferring party status or procedural rights of full participation. States choose one route or the other depending on desired legal influence and the risk of being bound by the judgment.

Practical effects and limits if intervention is authorized
- Authorized interveners generally may submit memorials, counter‑memorials or observations, appear in oral hearings, and make evidentiary submissions relating to their legal interest. However, the Court commonly tailors the scope of involvement to the relevant legal questions to prevent procedural fragmentation.
- Intervention can materially affect the case’s substance by bringing new legal arguments, factual material, or treaty interpretations to the Court’s attention.

Consequences for res judicata and binding effects
- A central strategic consideration for any potential intervenor is the effect of the eventual judgment on its own legal position. Allowing intervention can implicate the doctrine of res judicata or preclusive effects for the intervenor in relation to the matters adjudicated. For states concerned about preserving legal flexibility or avoiding being bound on sensitive legal points, this risk may counsel against intervention.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India, the intervention mechanism is a tool to be used sparingly and strategically. When India’s distinct legal rights — for instance in maritime delimitation, treaty interpretation, or jurisdictional status relating to national security matters — risk being affected by a dispute between other states, Article 62 intervention can protect those rights and shape legal precedent.
- The decision to intervene requires balancing legal gains against diplomatic costs and the risk of binding adjudication. India’s strategic culture, which privileges legal autonomy and calibrated multilateral engagement, suggests preference for targeted interventions on core legal interests and use of amici or diplomatic measures where binding exposure is undesirable.
- Finally, participation as an intervener can be an instrument of normative influence: by defending particular readings of customary rules, treaty texts, or jurisdictional principles India can advance legal positions consonant with its broader security and foreign‑policy objectives.

Conclusion
- Intervention under Article 62 remains an exceptional but potent means by which third states can defend legal interests at the ICJ. Its narrow textual standard, discretionary character, and significant legal consequences explain its rarity. For states like India, the mechanism must be deployed with careful legal assessment and strategic foresight — balancing the benefits of shaping international law against the costs of procedural entanglement and potential binding effects.

### 6.X Post‑Deliberation Outputs of the International Court of Justice and Their Significance

This section examines what happens inside and immediately after the International Court of Justice (ICJ) reaches a decision: the confidential process of judicial deliberation, the form and legal effect of the majority (or “memorial”) judgment, the role and publication of separate opinions (concurring and dissenting), the finality of ICJ judgments, the narrow procedural remedies available after judgment, and the practical limits on enforcement. These procedural and doctrinal features shape how states — including India — perceive the Court as a forum for resolving disputes that touch upon national security and strategic interests.

Deliberation and the Making of a Judgment
- After oral and written proceedings close, the judges of the ICJ retire to deliberate in private. Deliberations are confidential: they are intended to promote frank exchange and to protect the integrity of judicial reasoning.
- During the conference the Court votes, identifies the majority position, and assigns drafting responsibilities. The outcome of this process is the Court’s majority opinion — the formal judgment containing findings of fact, legal reasoning, and operative clauses that determine the rights and obligations of the parties in that particular case.

The Majority Opinion: Official and Binding Between the Parties
- The majority opinion is the Court’s official pronouncement and determines the case outcome. It sets out the legal basis for the decision and the remedies (if any) ordered.
- By virtue of the Statute and practice of the Court, ICJ judgments are final and binding on the parties to the case. The Court’s decision is authoritative for the dispute at hand and normally settles the legal controversy between the parties.

Concurring and Dissenting Opinions: Publication and Jurisprudential Influence
- Individual judges who agree with the result but not with the majority’s reasoning may write concurring opinions; those who disagree with the outcome may produce dissenting opinions.
- These separate opinions are published together with the majority judgment. They do not alter the binding effect of the majority decision for the parties, but they are an important part of the Court’s output: they illuminate alternative legal approaches, critique or refine doctrinal points, and often influence the development of international law by offering persuasive reasoning for future cases and scholarship.

Finality and the Absence of an Appeal
- There is no appeal from an ICJ judgment. Finality is a core feature of the Court’s role in the peaceful settlement of disputes: once the Court has decided, the merits of the case may not be re‑litigated on appeal.
- This finality makes the initial proceedings and the strategic decision to submit a dispute to the ICJ a weighty choice for states, particularly where questions of sovereignty or vital national security interests are implicated.

Limited Post‑Judgment Remedies: Interpretation and Revision
- Two narrow procedural mechanisms exist to address post‑judgment concerns:
  - Interpretation: If a party claims there is a dispute about the meaning or scope of a judgment, any party to the case may request the Court to interpret it. Interpretation proceedings are strictly focused on clarifying the text — they do not permit re‑litigation of the merits.
  - Revision: A party may seek revision of a judgment in highly limited circumstances if a new decisive fact comes to light that was unknown at the time of the decision and which would have been a decisive factor. Such revision requests are exceptional and subject to strict criteria.
- These remedies preserve the stability of judgments while allowing correction or clarification in the face of genuinely exceptional developments.

Enforcement: Legal Obligation and Political Reality
- ICJ judgments are binding on the parties, and under the UN Charter the Security Council may be called upon where a party fails to comply. In practice, enforcement of ICJ judgments depends heavily on state compliance and the international political context.
- The Court has no independent means of executing its decisions; its authority rests on legal obligation and the willingness of states and international organs (notably the Security Council) to ensure execution. This gap between legal finality and practical enforcement imbues ICJ judgments with both normative importance and political fragility.

Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy
- For a state like India, the features outlined above shape the calculus of resort to the ICJ. The confidentiality of deliberations, the authoritative force of a majority judgment, and the absence of appeal make the ICJ a forum capable of producing definitive legal outcomes — an advantage where legal clarity can buttress diplomatic or normative positions.
- Yet the limited enforcement mechanisms and the political dimensions of compliance mean that New Delhi (as with other states) will often weigh legal remedies against diplomatic, military and domestic considerations. Separate opinions can be especially valuable: concurrences and dissents provide legal arguments that may be deployed in subsequent negotiations, domestic litigation, or broader norm‑building initiatives that influence strategic behaviour over time.

Conclusion
- The ICJ’s post‑deliberation outputs — a confidential deliberative process culminating in a majority judgment accompanied by published concurring and dissenting opinions — produce legally final decisions that are binding between the parties but not appealable. Interpretation and revision are narrowly circumscribed remedies; enforcement depends on state compliance and, ultimately, the political will of the UN Security Council. Together, these features structure how states, including India, use the Court: as a source of authoritative legal pronouncements whose lasting effect depends as much on politics and practice as on jurisprudence.

## Criticisms of the International Court of Justice

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) occupies a central place in the architecture of international adjudication. Yet its authority and effectiveness have been the subject of sustained critique. The criticism is not merely about occasional judicial mistakes or controversial appointments; it targets structural limits in the Court’s jurisdiction, enforcement capacity, institutional embedding within the United Nations, and patterns of judicial behaviour. Below I set out the principal lines of criticism, explain their legal and political premises, and indicate their practical consequences — including for states such as India that calibrate strategy between law and power.

1. Jurisdictional limits and the primacy of consent
- The ICJ’s jurisdiction rests fundamentally on state consent. Article 36 of the Court’s Statute and the practice of special agreements and declarations (so-called “optional clause” declarations) make clear that the Court adjudicates disputes only where states have agreed to submit them.
- Compulsory jurisdiction is therefore limited in practice: many disputes (notably those involving allegations of aggression or use of force) never reach the Court because one or both parties withhold consent. Consequently, the Security Council frequently becomes the forum for such cases, shifting them from legal adjudication to political negotiation, bargaining, or sanctions.

2. Binding judgments that are not self‑enforceable
- ICJ judgments are legally binding on the parties to a case. However, the Court lacks coercive enforcement mechanisms of its own. Article 94 of the UN Charter places the primary responsibility for securing compliance in the hands of the Security Council.
- This arrangement creates a gap between legal obligation and practical compliance: where states are unwilling to implement a judgment, the ICJ cannot marshal enforcement forces. Implementation therefore depends on political will — either the losing state’s acquiescence or other UN organs taking follow‑on action.

3. The Security Council linkage and the separation‑of‑powers problem
- Because enforcement depends on the Security Council, the five permanent members’ (P5) political power — especially veto prerogatives — can blunt the effect of ICJ rulings. A ruling against a P5 state may be effectively unenforceable if that state blocks Security Council measures by veto or through political influence.
- This institutional linkage undermines a strict separation between judicial determination of legal rights and political enforcement of those determinations, producing a practical asymmetry: the ICJ can pronounce obligations, but political actors often determine whether those pronouncements have consequences.

4. Practical consequences: politicization and avoidance of legal accountability
- The combined effect of limited jurisdiction and the Security Council’s central role is that grave allegations (for example, state aggression) often receive political, rather than judicial, resolution. Powerful states can thereby immunize controversial conduct from legal consequences by keeping disputes out of the Court or preventing enforcement.
- The well‑known Nicaragua v. United States (1986) judgment illustrates this dynamic: the Court found violations of customary and treaty obligations by the United States, but the practical legal accountability of the United States was limited because the political machinery of the UN did not produce effective enforcement.

5. Judicial parsimony and preliminary dismissals
- The ICJ is often criticized for demonstrating judicial parsimony: declining to decide on the merits by resolving cases on jurisdictional or preliminary grounds. Critics argue this tendency avoids addressing the substantive legal issues in politically sensitive disputes.
- The motives behind such parsimony are mixed and contested. They can reflect legal caution and fidelity to the consent principle, an attempt to avoid intruding into politically charged matters, or institutional pressures related to the Court’s dependence on state cooperation. Whether parsimony is a prudential judicial virtue or an abdication of responsibility remains debated.

6. Allegations of political bias in judicial decision‑making
- Empirical studies have alleged patterns of bias in ICJ decision‑making: judges purportedly favour states that appointed them, states economically similar to their home countries, or states with similar political systems. Such findings, if robust, threaten the Court’s perceived impartiality and therefore its legitimacy.
- Methodological caveats are important. Empirical claims require careful control for case mix, the legal plausibility of competing arguments, and the strategic contexts in which states litigate. Nevertheless, even the perception of partiality can deter states from accepting the Court’s jurisdiction and can erode popular and diplomatic confidence in judicial remedies.

7. Reform proposals and institutional remedies
- In response to these criticisms, scholars and practitioners have proposed several reforms:
  - Expand acceptance of compulsory jurisdiction, for example by encouraging more widespread and less conditional optional‑clause declarations.
  - Strengthen compliance mechanisms short of force, such as more robust reporting, periodic review, or coordinated use of sanctions by UN organs or regional organisations.
  - Increase transparency and merit‑based procedures in judicial selection to reduce patronage and perceived political capture.
  - Develop procedural safeguards and ethics rules to mitigate bias, including clearer recusal norms and stronger conflict‑of‑interest rules.
- Each reform faces political obstacles: states that benefit from the status quo — particularly powerful states — have little incentive to cede leverage.

8. Enduring role and the limits of critique
- Despite the critiques, the ICJ remains the principal judicial organ for inter‑state disputes and a key producer of authoritative legal reasoning on international law. Its judgments and advisory opinions shape norms, influence state practice, and provide interpretive guidance that other courts, tribunals, and political actors use.
- The Court’s constraints are therefore not solely failures; they reflect a deliberate balance in the international legal order between respect for state sovereignty and the aspiration for rule‑based resolution of disputes.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- For a state like India, these institutional realities matter for how law is used instrumentally in strategy. India is likely to:
  - Value the ICJ as a source of legal legitimacy and norm development, using its decisions to bolster diplomatic positions.
  - Be cautious about submitting disputes to compulsory adjudication where political stakes are high and enforcement uncertain.
  - Complement legal strategies with political forums, bilateral diplomacy, and regional mechanisms when seeking remedies or managing threats.
- In short, the ICJ is an important component of India’s toolkit, but its known limitations push Indian policy-makers to combine legal approaches with political and strategic measures.

Conclusion
The ICJ is simultaneously indispensable and institutionally constrained. Its reliance on state consent, its lack of self‑enforcement, and its embedding within the UN political system generate predictable vulnerabilities — judicial parsimony, politicization of enforcement, and charges of bias. Reforms could mitigate some weaknesses, but many remedies require political will that the most advantaged states may be reluctant to surrender. For scholars and practitioners of strategic policy, the Court’s strengths lie in normative influence and dispute‑resolution potential; its weaknesses highlight the enduring primacy of power and politics in international affairs.
