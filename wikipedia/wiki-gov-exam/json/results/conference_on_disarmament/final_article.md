### Multilateral disarmament forum: The Conference on Disarmament

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) is the principal multilateral negotiation forum for arms control and disarmament. Established by the international community in the late 1970s and based at the Palais des Nations in Geneva, the CD occupies a central institutional place in global disarmament diplomacy. Its formal meetings in the Council Chamber of the Palace of Nations signal both the diplomatic character of its work and its close practical relationship with the United Nations system (notably the UN Office at Geneva and the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs).

Function and mandate
- The CD’s core purpose is negotiation: it exists to negotiate multilateral arms-control and disarmament agreements that limit, reduce or eliminate categories of weapons and related activities. Its mandate has been interpreted to cover a wide range of topics — from nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation to measures concerning fissile materials, outer space, chemical and biological weapons, and confidence‑building mechanisms.
- The body is best understood as a negotiation forum rather than an implementation or verification agency. When it produces treaties, separate institutions or national authorities normally handle implementation and enforcement.

Institutional form and rhythm
- The CD is permanently based in Geneva and holds multiple sessions each year (customarily three main sessions), reflecting the continuous but episodic nature of diplomatic negotiation. Meeting cycles and the seasonal rhythm of Geneva diplomacy help sustain ongoing work programs while leaving space for national capital consultations.
- Operationally the CD uses a bureau/presidency to manage sessions; the presidency rotates among members or regional groups and is designed to ensure procedural continuity and balance. Proceedings are formally recorded, and the Geneva location facilitates immediate interaction with resident diplomatic missions, specialised agencies, NGOs and UN disarmament offices.

Membership and decision‑making
- Membership is limited and representative rather than universal; in recent years the CD has commonly been cited as having some 65 members drawn from all major geographic groups. This composition is intended to keep the forum manageable while representing global interests.
- Decisions in the CD are taken by consensus. Consensus encourages comprehensive, broadly acceptable outcomes but also creates vulnerability to deadlock: a single or small number of members can block progress on an agenda item by withholding consent. This structural feature explains both the CD’s capacity to produce carefully negotiated instruments and its frequent inability to move forward on contested topics.

Agenda and substantive work
- The CD’s agenda traditionally includes nuclear disarmament and non‑proliferation; negotiation of a fissile material cut‑off treaty (FMCT); measures to prevent an arms race in outer space (PAROS); negative security assurances; and controls on chemical and biological agents, among other topics. The forum also addresses cross‑cutting confidence‑building and verification measures.
- Historically the CD has been the venue for important multilateral negotiations. Notably, many of the negotiating processes that led to the Chemical Weapons Convention and other instruments were conducted in Geneva’s disarmament fora. Yet several high‑profile agenda items — most prominently a verifiable FMCT and an agreed approach to space weaponization — have languished for years because of political disagreements and consensus blockage.

Notable strengths and limits
- Strengths: as a concentrated multilateral negotiating chamber, the CD brings together major regional and strategic actors in a setting designed for detailed, technically informed bargaining. Its proximity to diplomatic and UN expertise in Geneva strengthens the quality of negotiation and access to subsidiary technical resources.
- Limits: the consensus decision rule, the limited and sensitive membership, and deep strategic divides among members have produced recurrent paralysis. Since the late 1990s and into the 21st century, periodic stalemates have led states to seek alternative fora (including UN General Assembly processes or plurilateral initiatives) when the CD is unable to progress on pressing issues.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India has been an active member of Geneva disarmament processes, treating the CD as a central multilateral arena for articulating its positions on arms control. Participation in the CD aligns with India’s wider strategic culture that values multilateral negotiation, legal instruments and normative frameworks as parts of a comprehensive security policy.
- On substantive items, India has consistently called for non‑discriminatory, verifiable and balanced measures. On the FMCT, for example, New Delhi has supported a negotiated cutoff but has insisted on issues such as existing stockpiles, a credible verification regime and equitable treatment of all states. India has also been a vocal advocate for measures that prevent the weaponization of outer space and for strengthening non‑proliferation norms while safeguarding national security imperatives.
- The CD’s limitations affect India’s options: when the CD is stalled, India — like other states — has to weigh alternatives (bilateral, plurilateral, or UN‑based approaches) to advance its objectives. Nevertheless, the CD remains strategically important because it is a legitimate, recognised venue where India can shape multilateral norms, defend strategic interests, and engage directly with major powers and regional partners on the technical and legal architecture of arms control.

Concluding assessment
- The Conference on Disarmament is a paradigmatic multilateral forum: institutionalised, Geneva‑based, technically informed, and consensus‑driven. It has both produced important treaties and demonstrated recurring incapacity to resolve some of the most contentious security dilemmas of our time. For India, the CD is a vital instrument of diplomatic practice — offering a stage to advance principled, negotiated solutions while illustrating the structural constraints that complicate multilateral disarmament in an age of strategic competition.

# Conference on Disarmament — History

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) occupies a central (if often contested) place in the institutional architecture of multilateral arms control. Conceived as a single, permanent multilateral negotiating forum for disarmament, the CD embodies both the ambition and the structural constraints of post‑Cold‑War diplomacy. For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the CD is important not only as a negotiating venue but because its mandate and practice intersect repeatedly with India’s long‑standing normative positions: non‑discrimination in treaty regimes, emphasis on verification, linkage of disarmament to development, and insistence on strategic autonomy.

Origins and institutional evolution
- The body now known as the Conference on Disarmament traces its direct institutional lineage to 1979, when it was created under the name Committee on Disarmament. In 1984 it was formally re‑constituted and renamed the Conference on Disarmament.
- The CD is the successor to three earlier multilateral disarmament bodies, reflecting an incremental expansion of membership and mandate since the early Cold War:
  - Ten Nation Committee on Disarmament (est. 1960),
  - Eighteen Nation Committee on Disarmament (1962–1968),
  - Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (1969–1978).
- The CD meets in Geneva and is embedded within the broader UN disarmament ecosystem: it reports to the UN General Assembly and functions as the single multilateral negotiating forum for a broad range of disarmament topics.
- Membership is geographically diverse; as of the present institutional configuration the CD comprises 65 member states drawn from all regions.

The Decalogue: the CD’s permanent agenda
- At its creation the Conference was given a permanent agenda — commonly referred to as the “Decalogue” — a set of standing subject‑matters the CD is mandated to address. The Decalogue establishes a deliberately wide remit that spans strategic, non‑strategic and development–security linkages.
- The Decalogue items (as conventionally listed) include:
  - nuclear weapons in all aspects;
  - other weapons of mass destruction;
  - conventional weapons;
  - reduction of military budgets;
  - reduction of armed forces;
  - disarmament and development;
  - disarmament and international security;
  - collateral measures; confidence‑building measures; effective verification methods in relation to appropriate disarmament measures, acceptable to all parties;
  - a comprehensive programme of disarmament leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control.
- Note on numbering: the title “Decalogue” suggests ten items. The frequently quoted lists, however, sometimes present nine explicit headings or group several sub‑matters together; this reflects both historical drafting choices and the intentionally broad, overlapping character of the agenda.
- Each Decalogue topic is capacious: for example, “nuclear weapons in all aspects” embraces testing, doctrines, stockpiles, non‑proliferation, security of fissile material, and disarmament verification. The agenda therefore gives the CD authority to engage across the full spectrum of arms‑control questions.

Decision‑making, procedure and institutional consequences
- The CD’s rules require that decisions be taken by consensus. Consensus was chosen to secure the buy‑in of all participants and to respect state sovereignty over disarmament commitments. In practice it means that any single member can block adoption of a Programme of Work or other substantive outcome.
- The consensus rule has two systemic effects:
  - It protects minority and national interests, enabling smaller states to exercise disproportionate influence.
  - It makes the CD vulnerable to stalemate; protracted deadlock on procedural matters has been a recurring problem since the late 1990s.
- The CD therefore reflects an institutional trade‑off: inclusiveness and legitimacy at the cost of operational agility.

Major achievement and chronic paralysis
- The CD’s most prominent substantive success is its negotiation of the Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty (CTBT), concluded in the 1990s and opened for signature in 1996. The CTBT illustrates the CD’s capacity, in favourable political conditions, to produce a major multilateral instrument with significant normative and technical architecture (for example, a global verification regime).
- Yet since the late 1990s the Conference has frequently been unable to agree a Programme of Work on account of divergent priorities among members. This paralysis has curtailed the CD’s ability to initiate or complete new comprehensive negotiations.

Typical fault lines and political constraints
- Persistent political fault lines explain much of the CD’s intermittent productivity:
  - East–West differences: divergent Cold War and post‑Cold War priorities about disarmament sequencing, transparency and force posture.
  - North–South divide: developing countries often seek linkages between disarmament and development, while developed states may prioritise non‑proliferation and technical verification measures.
  - Issue‑specific objections: particular national positions can block progress on specific files (e.g., negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut‑Off Treaty (FMCT) have been repeatedly stalled by concerns over scope, verification and treatment of existing stockpiles).
- Consequence: repeated stalemate in the CD has pushed states to alternative fora — the UN General Assembly, specialized agencies, regional instruments, coalitions of willing and plurilateral negotiation tracks — to pursue arms‑control and disarmament objectives.

Verification, legal linkages and the CD’s remit
- The Decalogue explicitly stresses “effective verification methods”. Verification is therefore central to the CD’s mandate: its discussions encompass technical, legal and institutional verification mechanisms that make disarmament commitments credible and enforceable.
- The CD is a negotiating venue rather than an implementation body. Its agenda and outputs overlap with the global normative framework embodied in instruments such as the Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the CTBT, the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The CD’s work often complements—and sometimes competes with—other treaty processes.

Implications and engagements specific to India
- India has consistently engaged with the CD’s themes from the perspective of its strategic culture. Core elements of India’s posture that intersect with CD debates include:
  - insistence on non‑discriminatory treaty frameworks (India has long criticised arrangements that institutionalise differential rights between nuclear and non‑nuclear states);
  - emphasis on verification and technically robust measures; and
  - linkage of disarmament to development and global equity.
- India is a member of the CD and has used the forum to articulate its positions on key files. Two illustrative interventions:
  - CTBT: while the CD produced the CTBT, India did not sign or ratify the Treaty in 1996 and later conducted nuclear tests in 1998. India has, however, affirmed support for effective verification and has advocated universal, non‑discriminatory approaches to nuclear constraints.
  - FMCT and PAROS: India supports a verifiable, non‑discriminatory FMCT addressing production of fissile material, but has stressed that any cut‑off regime not be allowed to freeze existing asymmetries in fissile‑material holdings. On prevention of an arms race in outer space (PAROS), India has called for restraint and legal measures to prevent weaponisation of space.
- For Indian policymakers, the CD’s procedural paralysis has both costs and opportunities:
  - Cost: inability of the CD to conclude negotiated instruments constrains multilateral progress on issues central to India’s security environment (e.g., fissile material controls).
  - Opportunity: the vacuums created by CD deadlock open space for India to pursue alternatives — regional initiatives, plurilateral coalitions, and bilateral confidence‑building measures — compatible with its strategic autonomy.

Issues likely to recur and what to monitor
- Persistent agenda items expected to recur in the CD include:
  - negotiations on an FMCT;
  - PAROS and norms governing outer space activities;
  - further measures on nuclear disarmament and transparency;
  - technical advances in verification and confidence‑building measures;
  - debates linking disarmament and development.
- Key indicators to monitor:
  - whether the CD is able to adopt a Programme of Work (a proximate signal of functional revival);
  - progress (or continued blockage) on FMCT negotiations;
  - any intra‑membership reforms to decision‑making practices (for example, discussion of alternatives to strict consensus);
  - renewed coalitions or caucuses (regional or issue‑based) that might catalyse formal negotiations.

Brief expert assessment
- The CD’s history demonstrates a fundamental institutional tension: it was designed for continuity and comprehensiveness (succession of predecessors, permanent Decalogue), yet its consensus‑based procedure and highly heterogeneous membership frequently inhibit action.
- The Conference is capable of episodic, high‑value outcomes (CTBT) but equally prone to prolonged paralysis. Understanding the CD therefore requires attention to both (a) the normative breadth of its mandate — the Decalogue’s multiple, overlapping subject‑matters — and (b) the political dynamics among states that determine whether that mandate can be operationalised.
- For India, the CD remains an important arena for articulating principles (non‑discrimination, verification, disarmament–development linkage) even as New Delhi must also hedge against the CD’s limitations by pursuing complementary bilateral, regional and plurilateral strategies that advance its national security objectives.

### Relationship to the United Nations

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) occupies a distinctive — and deliberately ambivalent — position within the international disarmament architecture. Formally independent of the United Nations, it is nonetheless embedded in the UN system through personnel, reporting lines and institutional service. This hybrid design shapes how states, including India, engage the CD: it offers procedural autonomy and negotiating flexibility while remaining accountable to a broader UN political and administrative ecosystem.

Key institutional features and their implications

- Formal independence and operational linkage  
  - The CD is not a UN organ in legal terms. It adopts its own rules of procedure, sets its own agenda and conducts its negotiations autonomously. This formal independence preserves the Conference’s ability to fashion bespoke negotiating modes that suit sensitive arms-control and disarmament bargaining.  
  - In practice, however, the CD is integrated into the UN ecosystem. The Director‑General of the United Nations Office at Geneva (UNOG) serves as the Secretary‑General of the Conference, and the Conference submits annual (or more frequent) reports to the UN General Assembly (UNGA). These arrangements create administrative continuity and political visibility within the UN system.

- The Secretary‑General linkage: facilitation and influence  
  - Having the UNOG Director‑General as the CD’s Secretary‑General creates a direct personal and administrative connection to UN bodies based in Geneva and to the wider UN secretariat. This facilitates coordination with other UN disarmament processes and gives the CD access to UN institutional capacity. At the same time, it embeds a degree of UN influence into an otherwise autonomous forum — a feature that can be used to amplify political momentum or to channel broader UN concerns into the CD’s work.

- Secretariat and substantive servicing by UNODA and CD Secretariat  
  - The Conference benefits from the organizational and technical support of the CD Secretariat and the Conference Support Branch of the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA) in Geneva. These bodies arrange meetings, prepare documentation, provide expert analysis and draft negotiating texts. For delegations, this support is essential: it converts political directives into negotiable technical proposals and maintains the institutional memory that continuity-sensitive negotiations require.

- UNGA resolutions: guidance, not command  
  - The UN General Assembly can recommend topics for the CD to address. Such recommendations are politically important — they can give issues momentum, broaden legitimacy, and reflect the concerns of the wider UN membership. Legally and procedurally, however, these recommendations are non‑binding. The CD retains discretion to accept, modify or ignore UNGA guidance through its own decision-making procedures. This division preserves the CD’s autonomy while allowing states to use the UNGA to build political pressure for specific agenda items.

- Formal reporting: transparency and political feedback  
  - Annual reporting to the General Assembly establishes a channel of accountability and transparency. The reports enable UN member states — including those not party to the CD’s membership — to monitor progress, table critiques, and supply political feedback. Reporting thus functions as a control valve between the CD’s specialized negotiations and the broader political deliberations of the UN system.

Political importance and concentrated expectations

- A single multilateral negotiating forum  
  - The CD is conventionally described as “the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum” of the international community. This characterization confers high political expectations: the CD is the place where major negotiating text for arms-control measures are conceived. But concentrating such expectations in one body also creates pressure and magnifies the consequences of stalemate. When the CD is unable to produce outcomes, the perceived vacuum affects global disarmament governance and dents confidence in multilateral negotiating machinery.

- Procedural autonomy vs. dependency on UN resources  
  - The CD’s autonomy in procedure and agenda-setting allows flexibility in negotiating modes (e.g., working groups, informal consultations, shuttle diplomacy). Yet its dependency on UN institutional resources for servicing and legitimacy means that autonomy is bounded. The CD can operate more nimbly than some UN organs, but it cannot function in isolation from the administrative and political support that UNODA and UNOG provide.

Practical and political challenges

- Consensus practice and the risk of stalemate  
  - The CD’s decision-making culture — historically leaning toward consensus — can produce paralysis. A single party’s objection may block progress, turning the CD into a forum for entrenched postures rather than productive bargaining. This structural tension between the desire for unanimous buy‑in and the need to make substantive progress is among the CD’s most persistent handicaps.

- UNGA recommendations reflect broader political pressures  
  - While UNGA recommendations can create political impetus, they may also import broader geopolitical tensions into the CD. The Conference must manage external expectations and political campaigns that may not align with its members’ readiness to negotiate or compromise.

- Membership, representativeness and negotiating dynamics  
  - The CD’s membership is drawn from major regional groups and is intended to be broadly representative. Diversity is a strength, bringing legitimacy and a plurality of perspectives. It is simultaneously a source of difficulty: divergent security priorities, strategic cultures and threat perceptions complicate consensus-building. For states like India, membership composition and coalition-building matter as much as formal procedures.

Location and diplomatic environment

- Geneva as a hub  
  - The CD’s base in Geneva situates it within the global hub for diplomacy on arms control and human security. Proximity to UNOG, other Geneva‑based disarmament entities, non‑governmental experts and think tanks amplifies opportunities for informal diplomacy, technical consultations and multi‑track engagement.

Implications for policymakers — a briefing for India

- Treat the CD as a hybrid instrument: combine political leverage with procedural engagement  
  - India’s strategic culture values multilateral legitimacy and strategic autonomy. In the CD’s hybrid setting, New Delhi should exploit the UNGA’s capacity to build political momentum on priority issues (shaping resolutions that recommend CD consideration), while simultaneously engaging the CD’s internal procedures and Secretariat services to craft technically sound negotiating texts.

- Use Geneva presence proactively  
  - India should maximize its Geneva diplomatic footprint: leverage the CD Secretariat and UNODA’s substantive resources; cultivate informals and technical working groups; and maintain close contact with regional and like‑minded coalitions. These actions help translate political objectives into negotiable formulations.

- Anticipate and manage consensus constraints  
  - Given the CD’s propensity for consensus‑based deadlock, India should invest in coalition-building early, prioritize pragmatic issues where convergence is plausible, and be prepared to use procedural creativity (e.g., working groups, rolling text) to overcome impasses.

- Balance principle and pragmatism  
  - India’s policy posture—defending strategic autonomy and national security while endorsing multilateral non‑proliferation norms—finds a natural home in the CD’s mix of autonomy and UN connectivity. The challenge is operational: convert principled positions into operational language that can attract broader support without compromising core security interests.

Conclusion

The CD’s relationship with the United Nations is one of deliberate hybridity: an institution designed to preserve negotiating autonomy while drawing on UN legitimacy and resources. For India, understanding this dual character is analytically and operationally important. It enables policymakers to use the General Assembly and Geneva‑based UN structures to amplify political support, while engaging the CD’s internal mechanisms to advance technically credible and politically acceptable disarmament outcomes. The strategic task is to navigate between these poles—autonomy and integration—so as to shape disarmament diplomacy in ways consistent with India’s national security and its broader normative commitments.

## The Work of the Conference on Disarmament

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) occupies a special place in the architecture of multilateral arms control: it is the single, standing multilateral negotiating forum for disarmament at the United Nations in Geneva. Its record is mixed — historically significant achievements sit alongside prolonged periods of paralysis — and those features matter for states whose strategic doctrines and national security policies are shaped by both capability concerns and institutional opportunities. For India, whose strategic culture emphasizes strategic autonomy, credible deterrence, universal and non‑discriminatory approaches to arms control, and careful calibration of treaty commitments, the CD’s evolution has had practical and normative consequences.

1. Historical successes and foundational treaties
- In its earlier phases, the Conference and its predecessors were notably effective in fulfilling their mandate to negotiate multilateral arms control instruments. The CD’s negotiating role contributed directly to several of the post‑war era’s major disarmament instruments:
  - Treaty on the Non‑Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), 1968
  - Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), 1972
  - Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), 1993
  - Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty (CTBT), 1996
- These instruments illustrate the CD’s capacity, when political conditions permit, to convert technical negotiation and legal drafting into widely recognized normative frameworks. They also show the CD’s role in shaping the normative expectations that inform national strategies — including India’s critique of perceived discrimination within the NPT and its continuing insistence on universal, non‑discriminatory approaches.

2. The turning point: post‑CTBT stagnation
- The apparent high‑water mark in 1996 was followed by a prolonged stall in the CD’s work. After the adoption of the CTBT, the body entered a period of stagnation that lasted more than a decade.
- The proximate procedural reason was the failure of members to agree on a work programme. But the paralysis had deeper causes: strained relations among major powers, divergent priorities among members, and frequent use of issue linkage — in which progress on one subject was conditioned on progress elsewhere — all combined to render a consensus‑based forum inoperable.

3. Structural features that shape outcomes
- Consensus decision‑making is central to the CD’s identity: decisions require unanimity, which empowers any single participant to block negotiations. This procedural rule guarantees inclusivity in theory, but in practice it renders the CD highly vulnerable to geopolitical rivalry.
- The CD’s limited and fixed membership (traditionally set at 65 participants) aims to balance regional representation and the inclusion of key states, but it excludes most UN members from direct participation. The combination of limited membership and consensus rule means that the CD is simultaneously privileged as a negotiating forum and fragile as an institution.
- These structural features repeatedly intersect with geopolitics: when major powers’ relations are strained, the CD’s procedures permit deadlock to be sustained indefinitely.

4. Technical and political contestation over agenda items
- Several substantive items have proven especially contentious at the CD:
  - Fissile Material Cut‑off Treaty (FMCT): technically complex, the FMCT debate revolves around scope (whether to ban only future production or to include existing stockpiles), verification modalities, and related issues of equity among nuclear and non‑nuclear states. Technical questions have often been intensified by political disagreement.
  - Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS): long on the CD’s agenda, PAROS highlights a classic divide between states seeking legally binding prohibitions on space weapons and those preferring non‑binding transparency, confidence‑building or deterrence‑based approaches. The variety of strategic interests in space has made consensus elusive.
  - Negative security assurances (NSAs): political commitments by nuclear‑armed states not to use nuclear weapons against non‑nuclear states are sensitive because they intersect with deterrence doctrines and the credibility of extended deterrence.
- Issue‑linkage has repeatedly been used as a bargaining strategy: progress on FMCT or PAROS, for example, is sometimes tied to concessions on other items. While linkage can be a rational bargaining tool, in a consensus forum it multiplies the opportunities for stalemate.

5. Renewal efforts and the 2009 breakthrough
- After years of inaction, the CD achieved a procedural breakthrough in 2009 when members agreed to establish several smaller working groups and resume substantive work. The 2009 work programme included groups to address:
  - Negotiation of an FMCT
  - Practical steps for nuclear disarmament and reductions
  - PAROS
  - Negative security assurances
- The 2009 initiative demonstrated that even entrenched institutional paralysis can be partially overcome through creative procedural measures (small, focused working groups with negotiated mandates). Yet the durability of such fixes depends on political will among the major powers.

6. Consequences of dysfunction: forum shopping and the TPNW
- Because the CD can be portrayed as dysfunctional — and because its limited membership precludes direct participation by many states — frustrated states have sought alternative venues. This dynamic of forum shopping was decisive in the creation of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).
- The TPNW (adopted in 2017 in the United Nations General Assembly) was negotiated outside the CD. Its emergence illustrates an important institutional lesson: when the standing multilateral forum is blocked, coalitions of states will build alternative multilateral pathways to pursue norm‑creating objectives. For states that prioritize universality and inclusion in treaty processes, the CD’s limited model can therefore be a catalyst for parallel initiatives.
- India’s stance: consistent with its emphasis on strategic autonomy and universal regimes, India did not participate in the TPNW process as a negotiating champion and has been cautious about the treaty’s implications for security and the established non‑proliferation architecture. More broadly, India has tended to favour forums and approaches that do not compromise its strategic requirements or that treat all states, including nuclear‑armed states, equitably.

7. Institutional and geopolitical drivers of reform
- The CD’s paralysis and the consequent proliferation of alternative fora have prompted recurring proposals for reform:
  - Modify the consensus rule (or create qualified majority routes for specific decisions)
  - Expand or rotate membership to enhance legitimacy and reduce entrenchment
  - Establish clearer, time‑bound work programmes and mandates
  - Create formal subsidiary bodies with defined deliverables
  - Strengthen linkages to verification and implementation mechanisms
- Any reform proposal must confront geopolitical reality: meaningful progress will require not just procedural innovation, but a reduction in strategic distrust among key players and a willingness to separate technical procedures from zero‑sum political bargaining.

8. Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- The CD’s mixed record interacts with India’s strategic culture in several ways:
  - Preference for universality: India’s historic critique of instruments perceived as discriminatory (notably the NPT) makes it wary of treaty processes that exclude key stakeholders or that entrench asymmetries.
  - Strategic autonomy and credible deterrence: India’s deterrence requirements make it cautious about any agreement that could be perceived to constrain its security without equivalent universal constraints on others.
  - Forum selection and coalition building: CD paralysis has incentivized India to pursue multiple diplomatic tracks — working within the CD when feasible, but also engaging in UN, regional, and plurilateral settings (including the Non‑Aligned Movement and G‑groupings) to advance arms control and strategic stability objectives.
  - Technical rigor coupled with political realism: India’s approach to items such as the FMCT and PAROS emphasizes clear technical definitions, robust verification, and avoidance of asymmetric obligations.
- Broader consequence: the CD’s vulnerabilities underscore a tension embedded in India’s posture — a desire for robust, universal arms control norms, alongside skepticism of fora whose procedures allow a few actors to freeze or shape agendas in ways that impinge on its security priorities.

9. Conclusions: prospects and pathways forward
- The CD has a demonstrable historical capacity to produce foundational treaties, but institutional design (consensus rule, fixed membership) makes it susceptible to geopolitical stalemate. Substantive objectives that matter for India — negotiating an FMCT, advancing measures to prevent weaponization of space, strengthening negative security assurances, and achieving credible nuclear reductions — remain on the agenda but require both political rapprochement among major powers and procedural changes within the CD.
- The emergence of the TPNW outside the CD is a cautionary exemplar: when the CD is blocked, global disarmament governance can fragment as states seek alternative paths. For India, the challenge is to shape and participate in inclusive processes that reconcile its security needs with global normative advances.
- Meaningful progress in the CD — and therefore in the broader disarmament landscape relevant to India — will most likely require a combination of: limited procedural reforms to reduce the capacity of single actors to veto action; confidence‑building among key states to reduce linkage bargaining; and sustained technical work on verification and implementation modalities that addresses the core security concerns of all relevant players.

Glossary (key terms)
- FMCT: Fissile Material Cut‑off Treaty — a proposed instrument to prohibit future production of weapons‑usable fissile material. Debates focus on scope (future production only versus inclusion of existing stocks) and verification arrangements.
- PAROS: Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space — a standing CD agenda item. Positions diverge between advocates of legally binding prohibitions on certain space‑based systems and proponents of non‑binding transparency and confidence‑building measures.
- Negative security assurances (NSAs): political commitments by nuclear‑armed states not to use or threaten nuclear weapons against non‑nuclear states. Their legal status, scope and credibility are politically sensitive because they intersect with doctrines of nuclear deterrence.
- Consensus decision‑making: a procedural rule requiring unanimity among CD members for decisions; it provides maximum inclusiveness but allows any one member to block progress.

This balanced appraisal of the CD — its achievements, its structural constraints, and the political tensions that animate its agenda — helps explain why states like India pursue a cautious, multi‑track approach to disarmament diplomacy: seeking universal, verifiable, and equitable outcomes while safeguarding national security imperatives.

## The Conference on Disarmament: Membership, Informal Groupings, and Implications for India

Overview

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) is the principal multilateral negotiating forum for arms control and disarmament. Its formal membership comprises 65 states drawn from every geographic region. That broad composition is a deliberate feature: legitimating negotiations, ensuring that principal strategic actors are at the table, and giving smaller and less‑resourced states formal access to debates that directly affect global and regional security. For a country like India — a declared nuclear‑armed state outside the NPT framework that seeks both strategic autonomy and international recognition of its security concerns — the CD is therefore an important diplomatic arena.

Membership and informal regional groups

Although the CD’s 65 members meet in plenary, much of their preparatory work and day‑to‑day coordination occurs through informal regional groupings. These groupings broadly map onto the familiar United Nations regional categories (Western European and Others; Eastern European; African; Asia–Pacific; and Latin America and the Caribbean). Their functions are practical rather than legal:

- To prepare positions and slate nominations ahead of plenary meetings.
- To coordinate representation so members attend with coherent regional positions.
- To enable coalition‑building across regions when negotiating mandates, bureau elections, or working group membership.

For India, membership in the Asia–Pacific grouping (and its broader interactions with coalitions such as the Non‑Aligned Movement) provides both an operational platform and a diplomatic channel to shape the CD’s agenda. Inclusion of all known nuclear‑weapon states among the CD membership — China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and others de facto acknowledged — ensures that the principal strategic actors who would be affected by arms‑control measures are present in discussions. This is essential for the feasibility of meaningful agreements.

Operational dynamics: consensus, inclusiveness, and stalemate

The CD operates largely by consensus. Consensus rules and a wide, geographically balanced membership produce a double‑edged dynamic:

- Inclusiveness and legitimacy: Wide participation gives decisions and negotiating mandates normative weight; smaller and less‑resourced states gain formal access to a high‑level multilateral process.
- Vulnerability to blockage: A single or a small group of members can prevent consensus, producing institutional stalemate. The CD’s consensus rule has repeatedly made it difficult to launch negotiations on specific treaties (for instance, on a verified fissile‑material cutoff or other high‑stakes instruments).

Regional group dynamics influence both sides of this trade‑off. On one hand, regionally coordinated positions can overcome atomized voting by presenting united blocs; on the other, divergent priorities among nuclear and non‑nuclear states or between regional neighbors can harden impasses.

Practical effects of membership and grouping

Membership and the informal group system have tangible consequences for how the CD functions:

- Agenda‑setting and negotiating mandates often reflect which groups can marshal support.
- Elections to the CD bureau and chairs of subsidiary bodies are heavily influenced by regional slating practices.
- Smaller working groups and contact groups normally emerge from coalitions formed within or across regional groupings.
- Administrative and expert support is provided by UN mechanisms (meetings are hosted in Geneva with secretariat support from UN Geneva and substantive assistance from UN offices dealing with disarmament), linking national delegations to expert analysis and drafting capacity.

These mechanics matter for India’s opportunities to influence outcomes: chairing or sustaining a working group, building cross‑regional coalitions in favour of India’s preferred formulation (for example, on non‑discriminatory approaches to disarmament), or securing favourable bureau seats can materially shape negotiations.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy

India’s strategic culture combines principled multilateralism (emphasis on universal, non‑discriminatory regimes), an insistence on recognition of its security environment, and a practice of coalition diplomacy. The structure and practice of the CD intersect with these elements in several specific ways:

- Legitimacy and voice: The CD’s inclusive membership allows India to press its normative arguments — such as non‑discrimination in disarmament — in a multilateral setting that includes the major nuclear actors.
- Engagement by principal actors: Having all known nuclear‑weapon states present is crucial for any agreement that affects Indian security calculus; India’s presence alongside other nuclear states makes it possible to seek parity of obligations or to insist on balanced verification measures.
- Coalition building: Because smaller states’ individual leverage is limited, India’s ability to form coalitions (within the Asia–Pacific group, with NAM members, or across regions) is essential to advance its positions and to prevent outcomes that would be perceived as discriminatory.
- Constraints on action: The CD’s consensus rule, while reflecting India's preference for negotiated legitimacy, also means that India cannot rely on the body to deliver binding advances without broad buy‑in; protracted stalemate can frustrate both India’s procedural goals (e.g., launching negotiations on a particular treaty) and substantive aims (e.g., addressing regional asymmetries).

Analytical signposts: what to watch

For analysts of India’s national security policy, CD activity yields early signals about evolving multilateral dynamics and India’s diplomatic strategy. Key things to watch include:

- Which regional groups are driving agenda items and how India positions itself within or against those groupings.
- The degree and nature of engagement by other nuclear‑armed states — whether they are constructive, obstructive, or seeking frame‑setting advantages.
- India’s coalition partners on issues of verification, non‑discrimination, and treaty scope (FMCT, fissile material controls, and other instruments).
- Whether consensus can be achieved on mandates and draft texts or whether procedural blockage persists — and how India reacts (quiet coalition‑building, public diplomacy, or alternative multilateral tracks).

Conclusion

The CD’s 65‑member composition and its informal regional groupings present both opportunities and constraints for Indian strategic policy. They provide India with a legitimate multilateral platform to assert its principles and influence substantive outcomes, but the consensus‑based, regionally mediated system also requires adept coalition diplomacy. Understanding how India navigates the CD illuminates broader features of its strategic culture: the preference for normative multilateralism, the insistence on recognition of security realities, and a pragmatic use of diplomatic coalitions to translate principles into negotiated results.

# Western European and Others Group (WEOG) — Listed Members (Conference on Disarmament context)

Summary
- This section presents and analyses a roster of 25 states identified as the Western European and Others Group (WEOG) for purposes of coordination and bargaining within the Conference on Disarmament (CD). The list blends core Western European states with non‑European “others” (North America, Oceania, East Asia, and Israel). Its composition matters because regional groupings structure candidacies, speaking and negotiating blocs, and informal coalition‑building in multilateral disarmament diplomacy — all of which have direct and indirect consequences for Indian strategic calculations in multilateral fora.

Membership (as listed)
- The roster supplied enumerates 25 states. Below are each state and succinct analytical notes on their relevance to WEOG dynamics in the CD.

  - Argentina
    - Note: Unusual entry. Argentina is normally a member of the Latin American and Caribbean Group (GRULAC). Its inclusion in this WEOG list should be treated as anomalous and verified against the authoritative CD participant roster. If correct, it may reflect a special participation arrangement or transitory listing rather than a permanent regional realignment.

  - Australia
    - A principal “Other” in WEOG. As a middle power in the Asia‑Pacific and a close security partner of NATO/Western states, Australia brings technical expertise on export controls and non‑proliferation and often acts as a bridge between Western and Asia‑Pacific interests.

  - Austria
    - A continental European actor and host‑city proximate to Vienna’s disarmament ecosystem; Austria routinely champions normative, humanitarian approaches to arms issues.

  - Belgium
    - EU/NATO member; coordinates Western positions, particularly on sanctions, export controls, and multilateral transparency mechanisms.

  - Canada
    - Non‑European “Other”; a consistent proponent of non‑proliferation, arms‑control verification measures, and human security frames in disarmament debates.

  - Finland
    - Northern European perspective; its proximity to Russia and recent regional security dynamics influence its priorities on verification, confidence building and arms control.

  - France
    - A Western nuclear‑weapon state (NWS) and permanent UNSC member. France combines commitment to arms‑control institutions with preservation of nuclear deterrent doctrines, affecting coalition choices and negotiable language on constraints.

  - Germany
    - Major EU power and standard‑setter on export controls, verification and multilateral technical cooperation in disarmament processes.

  - Hungary
    - Central European NATO/EU member; represents perspectives of newer EU members on burden‑sharing, NATO commitments and regional security.

  - Ireland
    - EU member with a strong humanitarian emphasis in disarmament (e.g., cluster munitions). Not a NATO member; often leads normative campaigns within WEOG caucusing.

  - Israel
    - Geographically Middle Eastern but placed within WEOG practice. Israel’s undeclared nuclear posture and regional security concerns make it a distinctive and sometimes controversial actor within WEOG negotiations.

  - Italy
    - EU/NATO member; engages in alliance‑aligned positions and hosts NATO facilities that influence its posture on security‑sensitive issues.

  - Japan
    - Asia‑Pacific “Other”; significant technical and normative influence on non‑proliferation and peaceful use discourse and often collaborates closely with WEOG partners on verification and capacity building.

  - Netherlands
    - Active proponent of norms‑based disarmament initiatives; influential in legal and procedural aspects of multilateral instruments.

  - New Zealand
    - Pacific “Other” known for an anti‑nuclear legacy and leadership on humanitarian disarmament initiatives; often pushes for stringent disarmament standards.

  - Norway
    - Prominent humanitarian disarmament actor (e.g., cluster munitions process); uses facilitation and norm promotion as tools of influence.

  - Poland
    - Central/Eastern European NATO member; security concerns near Russia shape a generally cautious approach to measures perceived to undermine deterrence.

  - Republic of Korea (South Korea)
    - Asia‑Pacific “Other” with acute non‑proliferation interests due to the DPRK. Pragmatic on verification and regional security, and an important interlocutor for technical measures.

  - Slovakia
    - Small Central European EU/NATO member; typically aligns with EU positions and emphasizes legal‑institutional approaches.

  - Spain
    - EU/NATO member; participates in EU‑coordinated stances on arms control, export controls and disarmament instruments.

  - Sweden
    - Traditionally neutral but heavily engaged in humanitarian disarmament initiatives. Brings moral authority and technical inputs on civilian protection and law‑of‑armed‑conflict related issues.

  - Switzerland
    - Permanent neutral facilitator and Geneva‑based diplomacy hub; significant for chairing and hosting processes and for procedural facilitation within the CD context.

  - Turkey
    - NATO member straddling Europe and Asia; combines alliance obligations with regionally driven security interests that may complicate consensus on some disarmament measures.

  - United Kingdom
    - Western NWS and permanent UNSC member; central to shaping NATO‑aligned positions and in protecting doctrinal space for nuclear deterrence while engaging in selective arms‑control processes.

  - United States
    - Principal Western NWS with decisive influence on global arms‑control architecture and negotiating priorities; its policy centers (DoD, State, NSC labs) are determinative for CD outcomes involving verification and constraint of strategic forces.

Analytical observations and implications

- Purpose of the listing
  - The WEOG label is a UN regional grouping deployed for procedural coordination (candidacy slates, regional seats, informal caucusing) and bargaining in bodies such as the CD. In practice, it is a heterogenous coalition whose internal divisions and shared interests both shape and constrain CD outcomes.

- Characteristic pattern: West + “Others”
  - The roster exemplifies WEOG’s hybrid nature: core Western European states combined with non‑European “others” (North America, Oceania, East Asia, Israel). This mixing reflects diplomatic history, alliance ties, and functional affinities (e.g., shared legal traditions, security partnerships), rather than strict geography.

- Verification flag: Argentina
  - Argentina’s inclusion is atypical and must be checked. Possible explanations include clerical error, a special observer/participation status in a CD session, or a temporary cross‑group arrangement. For rigorous analysis, consult the official CD participant list maintained by the UN Office at Geneva.

- Nuclear‑weapon states and negotiation dynamics
  - The presence of declared NWS (United States, United Kingdom, France) and Israel (undeclared) within WEOG substantially shapes negotiation space. NWS members often prioritize safeguarding doctrines of deterrence, influence verification standards, and resist provisions perceived to constrain legitimate security needs — factors that affect whether CD deliberations can progress on disarmament, arms‑control and non‑proliferation instruments.

- Policy implications for the Conference on Disarmament
  - WEOG’s internal heterogeneity means it can act as a coordinating bloc on many technical issues (verification, export controls, norm promotion) but rarely presents fully unified positions on politically sensitive items (nuclear force reductions, legally binding limits affecting alliance postures). The presence of influential NWS and NATO members tends to push the WEOG caucus toward pragmatic, state‑security‑sensitive outcomes rather than maximalist humanitarian disarmament proposals.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India is not a WEOG member; it belongs to the Asia‑Pacific regional grouping at the UN and remains a nuclear‑armed state outside the NPT’s NWS framework. The WEOG composition matters for Indian strategy in three principal ways:
  1. Coalition dynamics and agenda control: WEOG coordination can shape which items gain traction in the CD. India must therefore watch WEOG caucusing to anticipate procedural moves and to build cross‑regional coalitions (with Non‑Aligned Movement members, Africa, and GRULAC) when its interests diverge from WEOG priorities.
  2. Normative versus doctrinal tensions: WEOG’s mix of humanitarian disarmament champions and nuclear‑armed states mirrors the dilemmas India faces — reconciling humanitarian appeals with strategic autonomy. India’s negotiating posture in the CD reflects its insistence on security‑sensitive language, verification equitability and the primacy of universal, non‑discriminatory rules.
  3. Technical and verification engagement: Many WEOG members supply verification technology, legal frameworks and capacity building. India can leverage bilateral and plurilateral technical cooperation with WEOG “others” (e.g., Japan, Australia, Canada) to advance selective arms‑control confidence‑building measures compatible with its strategic imperatives.

Operational note
- For precise procedural analysis (e.g., speaking order, candidacy allocations, alliance behaviour within the CD), this roster must be cross‑checked with the CD’s official participation lists and with UN regional group membership records. Membership and participation can differ across UN bodies and over time.

Recommended next steps (for researchers and policy analysts)
1. Validate roster: Check the CD official participant roster and UN regional group records to confirm current WEOG membership and to clarify Argentina’s status in this list.
2. Treaty posture mapping: Compile each listed country’s positions on key instruments (NPT status, CTBT signature/ratification, stances on specific humanitarian instruments such as cluster munitions or anti‑personnel mines) to model likely coalitions and friction points.
3. Identify swing actors: Determine which of the listed states are potential brokers or spoilers on high‑priority CD items (e.g., nuclear disarmament, space/cyber weapons norms, lethal autonomous weapons) to anticipate negotiation outcomes.
4. India‑focused strategy mapping: Map entry points for India to influence CD outcomes — bilateral technical cooperation, issue‑based coalitions (e.g., verification regimes), and cross‑regional caucusing to offset potential WEOG majorities on sensitive items.

Concluding note
- WEOG’s composition in the CD reflects a pragmatic aggregation of Western and like‑minded states whose internal diversity produces both negotiating leverage and constraint. For India, understanding the composition, preferences and fault lines within WEOG is an essential element of multilateral strategy — enabling effective coalition building, protecting strategic autonomy, and selectively engaging on technical measures that advance India’s security and normative interests.

## Conference on Disarmament — The “Group of 21” (G-21)

The Conference on Disarmament (CD) has long been a forum in which states form negotiating caucuses to amplify shared priorities. One such caucus — commonly called the “Group of 21” or G-21 — is composed largely of developing and middle‑income states that seek to coordinate positions on CD agenda items. The group’s membership, geographic breadth, and internal heterogeneity make it a consequential actor in CD deliberations and a useful prism through which to view India’s external behaviour on disarmament and its wider strategic culture.

### Composition and roster notes
Official rosters that circulate in CD documentation identify G-21 participants from Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. A typical list includes (inter alia): Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, DPRK, DRC, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Mongolia, Morocco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Senegal, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Syria (Syrian Arab Republic), Tunisia, Venezuela, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.

Two practical observations arise from the roster:
- The roster displayed in CD records often uses full formal state names (for example “Islamic Republic of Iran”, “Syrian Arab Republic”, “DPRK”), indicating a formal, official listing.
- Despite the historical label “G-21,” contemporary rosters often contain many more than 21 states. The name survives as a historical convention even when membership has expanded.

For India’s analyst-reader, the membership list matters not only for whom India aligns with, but for what negotiating leverage and constraints arise when India seeks to shape CD outcomes.

### Geographic diversity and political legitimacy
G-21 spans Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. This cross‑regional composition provides the caucus with broader political legitimacy within the CD than single‑region groupings. For India, the geographic reach of G-21 is an asset: it allows New Delhi to pursue positions within a broader Third World or Global South framework rather than appearing to act solely on South Asian grounds. It also creates opportunities for India to build issue‑specific coalitions — for example, on development-sensitive language about peaceful uses of nuclear technology or on humanitarian approaches to weaponization.

### Key influential members — implications for India
Certain G-21 members command outsized influence because of their size, regional influence, or contentious security postures: India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Pakistan, Iran and the DPRK. For India this has several consequences:
- India as an influential G-21 member can help shape Third World language on disarmament (e.g., equitable access to peaceful technologies, non‑discriminatory verification).
- Presence of Pakistan in the same caucus brings a complex bilateral subtext into ostensibly multilateral negotiations. India must manage coalition politics while also protecting national security prerogatives connected to deterrence.
- The inclusion of nuclear‑armed or nuclear‑contested states (India itself, Pakistan, DPRK) complicates the group’s ability to present perfectly harmonized positions on certain nuclear treaty particulars, especially those touching on verification and security guarantees.

India’s strategic culture — particularly its emphasis on strategic autonomy, normative leadership on issues of global South equity, and cautious approach to multilateral constraint on deterrence capabilities — shapes how it navigates these dynamics.

### Typical policy priorities advanced by the G-21
G-21 communiqués and negotiating behavior typically emphasize:
- Comprehensive disarmament framed in development terms (disarmament–development nexus).
- Equitable access to peaceful uses of nuclear technology and safeguards against discriminatory restrictions.
- Negative security assurances and concerns about security guarantees that protect non‑nuclear states.
- Humanitarian approaches to weapons and opposition to discriminatory regimes that might constrain sovereign development.
- Support for CD agenda items such as the Fissile Material Cut‑off Treaty (FMCT), prevention of arms races in outer space (PAROS), and measures to strengthen norms against biological and chemical weapons.

For Indian policymakers, these priorities dovetail with longstanding external themes: protecting the right to peaceful nuclear technology, resisting proposals that implicitly freeze strategic asymmetries, and foregrounding development concerns in security negotiations.

### Relation to other multilateral groupings (NAM / G‑77)
Many G-21 members are simultaneously active in the Non‑Aligned Movement (NAM) and the G‑77. This overlap matters:
- Coordination with NAM/G‑77 can amplify G‑21 positions, enabling a single South‑led narrative across multiple forums.
- Conversely, overlapping memberships can create competing obligations or rhetorical differences when NAM/G‑77 language is broader or more politicized than what is feasible in the CD’s consensus environment.

India, as a historical leader in NAM and an active participant in G‑77, uses these channels to synchronize messaging while retaining flexibility in CD negotiations.

### Negotiation dynamics in the CD and the power of blocs
The CD operates by consensus. Within that procedural frame:
- Cohesive blocs like the G‑21 can significantly influence agenda‑setting and the success or failure of proposals.
- A broad G‑21 can collectively insist on development‑sensitive treaty language, stronger provisions for the peaceful use of technology, or verification schemes that account for perceived inequities.
- However, the consensus rule also means that a single member or small coalition (including within G‑21) can block progress; therefore the ability to forge internal agreement is crucial.

For India, this balance presents both leverage and constraint: membership in a sizeable bloc confers bargaining power, but India's national security calculus (notably nuclear deterrence) can limit how far it will compromise even within a friendly caucus.

### Strategic implications and bargaining leverage
The broad composition of the G‑21 enables developing states to:
- Negotiate from a collective platform, extracting concessions on verification, technology transfer, and non‑discrimination.
- Use the moral and political weight of a “Global South” coalition to counterbalance proposals perceived as reflecting great‑power biases.

India’s strategic culture — favoring principled multilateralism tempered by sovereign prerogatives — often leads New Delhi to leverage such coalitions to protect strategic autonomy while projecting leadership on equity and development.

### Internal diversity and potential fault lines
G‑21’s strengths are matched by its internal heterogeneity:
- It contains nuclear and non‑nuclear states, states with divergent regional rivalries, and actors with very different threat perceptions.
- These differences can produce fault lines on technical issues such as verification standards, timelines for disarmament, or negative security assurances.

For India, fault lines can be both a challenge and an opportunity: India must manage intra‑bloc differences (e.g., with Pakistan or DPRK) to sustain a credible collective position, while exploiting divergences to avoid outcomes constraining to its deterrent needs.

### Negotiating posture, naming conventions and bureaucratic signals
The formal restatement of state names in CD rosters (e.g., “Islamic Republic of Iran”) and the historical persistence of the moniker “G‑21” are not trivial bureaucratic artifacts. They signal:
- Formal recognition and continuity of the caucus within CD practice.
- That negotiating groups evolve; names often outlast numerical accuracy.

India’s diplomats are attuned to these cues: procedural continuity can be used to claim institutional memory and leadership, while roster changes offer tactical openings for building new alliances.

### Recommended follow-up analysis (research agenda)
For scholars and policymakers focused on India’s strategic culture and national security implications of G‑21 activity, a targeted research agenda should include:
- Mapping each G‑21 member’s stated positions on core CD agenda items (FMCT, PAROS, negative security assurances).
- Tracking consensus statements and floor interventions by G‑21 delegations across recent CD sessions to identify spokesstates and coordinators.
- Comparing G‑21 communiqués with NAM/G‑77 statements to identify coordination or divergence.
- Assessing how India’s bilateral relations with key G‑21 members (Pakistan, Iran, DPRK, Brazil, South Africa) influence its multilateral positions.

Such empirical work will clarify where India can lead, where it must compromise, and where it will act alone.

### Operational note: spokespeople, leadership and coalition politics
Because the CD requires consensus, identifying which G‑21 members serve as spokespeople or coordinators is operationally vital:
- Leadership roles within the caucus can determine draft language, timing of proposals, and the framing of debate.
- External actors seeking to influence CD outcomes should therefore identify and engage the group’s de facto coordinators rather than approaching members only bilaterally.

India’s diplomatic corps frequently seeks such roles to shape outcomes, but must balance leadership with the need to protect sensitive strategic interests.

### Diplomatic signals and risks from inclusion of contentious states
The inclusion of politically sensitive actors (e.g., DPRK, Iran, Syria) in the G‑21 sends mixed diplomatic signals:
- It enhances the caucus’s role as a platform for politically contested voices from the Global South.
- It can, however, complicate efforts to secure consensus with Western and NATO delegations, who may perceive G‑21 positions as reflecting regimes whose actions they contest.

For Indian policymakers, this dynamic requires careful calibrations: India benefits from an inclusive South‑based platform, but must manage the reputational and negotiation risks that follow from bloc membership that includes contentious states.

### Data clarification and best practice
Given the fluidity of caucus rosters and the occasional mismatch between group names and membership counts, practitioners should:
- Verify current memberships and spokesmanship with the latest CD documentation and G‑21 communiqués before drawing operational conclusions.
- Monitor sessional records and statements to detect subtle shifts in coalition behavior.

For analysts of India’s strategic culture, maintaining accurate, current data enables realistic assessments of New Delhi’s room for maneuver in multilateral disarmament bargaining.

---

In sum, the G‑21 is more than a name on a roster: it is a cross‑regional negotiating vehicle whose composition, priorities and internal dynamics matter for India’s multilateral strategy. For New Delhi, the caucus is simultaneously an instrument of influence — a venue to promote development‑sensitive disarmament language and to exercise South leadership — and a constraint, insofar as shared platforms must be reconciled with India’s uncompromising imperatives around deterrence and strategic autonomy.

### Eastern European Group (EEG) — Membership Snapshot and Relevance to Disarmament Forums

Table: EEG participants as presented in the Conference on Disarmament material

| Belarus | Bulgaria | Kazakhstan |
|---|---|---|
| Romania | Russian Federation | Ukraine |

This compact, three-by-two table lists six sovereign states whose grouping here is identified as the Eastern European Group (EEG) for the purposes of a Conference on Disarmament (CD) session. Although short, the roster conveys several practical and analytic points about regional groupings, multilateral negotiation dynamics, and the implications those dynamics have for states—like India—that engage with global arms‑control regimes.

Key observations from the table
- The item is a tabular listing of six states (two rows, three columns) indicating EEG participation or representation relevant to the Conference on Disarmament.
- The six states are: Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Romania, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine.
- Entries are presented without hierarchy or role annotation; the list is primarily procedural—a roster for regional coordination in a particular multilateral context.
- EEG membership in UN-related forums can vary by forum and by moment; this table reflects the EEG composition or participants relevant to the CD document from which it was drawn.
- The EEG, as represented here, contains states with sharply divergent security alignments and normative positions, which affects consensus-building in disarmament negotiations.

Country-by-country notes and why each matters in disarmament diplomacy
- Belarus: A post‑Soviet Eastern European state with close political and security ties to the Russian Federation. Its positions at disarmament fora often align with Russian priorities on strategic stability and regional security concerns; it is not a member of NATO or the EU.
- Bulgaria: A member of NATO and the European Union (joined NATO in 2004, EU in 2007). Its participation brings the Euro‑Atlantic security perspective into EEG deliberations, including commitments to collective defence frameworks and related arms‑control priorities.
- Kazakhstan: Situated in Central Asia but included here in the EEG listing, Kazakhstan is consequential in disarmament discourse because of its 1990s decision to relinquish Soviet nuclear weapons and close the Semipalatinsk test site. It is a leading advocate of non‑proliferation, nuclear security, and the humanitarian framing of nuclear disarmament—positions that can shape agenda items in the CD.
- Romania: Another NATO and EU member (NATO 2004, EU 2007). Romanian positions typically reflect Euro‑Atlantic approaches to arms control, interoperability with NATO frameworks, and support for multilateral non‑proliferation mechanisms.
- Russian Federation: A major nuclear‑weapon state and central actor in global and regional arms control. Russia’s priorities—and its disagreements with Western states—often determine the feasibility of consensus outcomes in forums operating by consensus (such as the CD).
- Ukraine: An Eastern European state whose regional security concerns have been dominated by its post‑2014 conflict with Russia (and its escalation in 2022). Ukraine’s denuclearization history (the relinquishment of Soviet nuclear weapons in the 1990s under the Budapest Memorandum) and its subsequent security experience make it a salient voice on issues of security assurances, non‑proliferation, and the linkage between disarmament and political settlement.

Additional contextual points about EEG and the Conference on Disarmament
- Regional groups like the EEG are institutional devices commonly used across UN‑system bodies and Geneva‑based forums to manage speaking lists, allocate seats, coordinate procedural tactics, and present regional positions. Membership lists may be fluid across different organizations and sessions.
- The Conference on Disarmament functions largely by consensus. Thus, the presence of states with divergent strategic alignments within a single regional group—here, NATO/EU members alongside Russia‑aligned states and non‑aligned advocates—illustrates why reaching agreement can be difficult even on technical procedural matters.
- Kazakhstan’s inclusion is particularly notable for substantive reasons: as a state that voluntarily renounced nuclear weapons and successfully advocated for non‑proliferation measures, Kazakhstan can exercise moral and technical leadership in CD debates on fissile material, nuclear security, and humanitarian approaches to nuclear weapons.
- Geopolitical friction—most saliently between the Russian Federation and Ukraine—can impede substantive progress. Political tensions among EEG members often spill over into multilateral negotiations, hardening positions and complicating coalition‑building for specific treaty initiatives or negotiating drafts.
- For procedural mapping (e.g., speaking rosters, candidate slates for CD positions, or regional coordination meetings), such a roster serves as a compact EEG roster for the particular CD session—useful for diplomats, analysts, and states tracking alliance and voting patterns.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and multilateral engagement
- Even though India is not an EEG member, understanding the composition and internal diversity of regional groups like the EEG is important for Indian diplomacy at Geneva and in multilateral arms‑control forums. India’s practice of coalition management and normative positioning benefits from anticipating how regional groupings—especially those that include nuclear‑armed states or key non‑proliferation advocates—will behave in consensus‑based settings.
- Kazakhstan’s experience is an instructive case for India’s strategic culture: it exemplifies how a state can convert a unilateral denuclearization decision into sustained normative leadership on non‑proliferation. India’s own nuclear identity differs (India remains outside the NPT as a declared nuclear weapon state), but India can and does engage with such actors to advance pragmatic objectives—e.g., nuclear security, preventive measures against illicit trafficking, and technical cooperation.
- The presence of NATO/EU members and Russian‑aligned states within the same regional grouping demonstrates that multilateral outcomes often turn on procedural diplomacy and the ability to bridge divergent strategic outlooks. India’s diplomatic playbook—emphasizing strategic autonomy, coalition flexibility, and technical expertise—can be effective in such an environment if calibrated to respect these internal divisions and to offer issue‑based convergence.
- Persistent conflicts among EEG members (e.g., Russia–Ukraine) underscore that arms‑control dialogues are inseparable from broader political contexts. For India, whose strategic culture privileges realism tempered by normative engagement, this reinforces a dual approach: advance technical cooperation and confidence‑building measures while avoiding zero‑sum alignments that could foreclose India’s manoeuvrability in future negotiations.

Concluding remark
A small roster such as this is more than a procedural footnote: it encapsulates the heterogeneity that characterizes regional groups in disarmament diplomacy and signals the political currents that shape consensus outcomes. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, these micro‑mappings are indispensable—helping to forecast negotiation dynamics and to design diplomatic strategies that reflect both normative commitments and strategic realities.

### China — “Group of One” (Conference on Disarmament): analytical note

Context and problem statement  
The source entry contains only the single token “China” under the heading Conference on Disarmament → Group of One. As recorded, the entry is ambiguous: it may denote a sole member of a negotiating subgroup, a placeholder for a delegation or statement, or a shorthand marker that a particular item is effectively driven by China alone. For a book concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, unpacking the possible meanings and, more importantly, the substantive content behind this one-word entry is essential because China’s posture in multilateral disarmament fora materially shapes New Delhi’s negotiating environment and hedging choices.

Interpretations of the “Group of One” label
- Literal reading: the group consists of China alone for the specified agenda item — i.e., China acts as a solo interlocutor or sponsor.  
- Procedural reading: “Group of One” is a temporary procedural label used in CD practice to indicate a single-state initiative or the absence of coalition partners for a proposal.  
- Placeholder reading: the entry awaits elaboration (delegation name, statement text, working paper number).  
Each reading points to different analytical next steps: confirm membership and track the statement or paper; or, if a placeholder, retrieve and attach the missing primary materials.

China’s relevant policy markers in the Conference on Disarmament
- Nuclear doctrine: China officially maintains a relatively restrained posture (including a declared no-first-use policy and a historically smaller, survivable arsenal compared with other P5 members). These doctrinal markers influence both the content and tone of Chinese interventions in the CD.  
- Treaty positions: China has publicly supported the Comprehensive Nuclear‑Test‑Ban Treaty (CTBT) in principle (it is a signatory and ratified the CTBT in 1999), and has long participated in FMCT debates, but it stresses balanced, non‑discriminatory outcomes and has been cautious about treaty provisions it considers asymmetric.  
- Negotiation style: China typically favors step‑by‑step, consensus-based processes that respect state sovereignty and non‑interference. It resists measures perceived to disproportionately constrain its legitimate security interests or to entrench existing strategic asymmetries without reciprocal obligations.  
- P5 dynamics and independence: as a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a P5 nuclear power, China sometimes coordinates with other P5 positions but also pursues independent or regionally calibrated stances — explaining why it can, in particular cases, appear as a “Group of One.”

Operational details that should accompany the entry (recommended)
To make the entry analytically useful, append the following factual elements whenever available:
- delegation head and rank (name, mission to the UN/ambassador, CD head of delegation);  
- date and title of the statement(s) delivered at the CD;  
- working paper numbers and short abstracts (if China authored/sponsored any documents relevant to the item);  
- record of voting/consensus behaviour or formal objections (the CD operates by consensus, so “blocking” statements or procedural holds are especially salient);  
- negotiating priorities as reflected in recent interventions (e.g., FMCT verification concerns, insistence on linkage between disarmament and non‑proliferation, emphasis on security assurances).

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Negotiating posture and hedging: China’s insistence on sovereignty, non‑interference, and incrementalism shapes New Delhi’s calculus on whether to pursue bilateral confidence‑building with Beijing, multilateral arms control leadership, or independent deterrence enhancement. India’s own reluctance to accept certain constraints (for example, its non‑ratification of the CTBT and insistence on an equitable FMCT framework) is in part a response to the P5 dynamics and perceived distributional impacts of arms control measures.  
- Alliance and multilateral tactics: when China acts alone or blockingly in the CD, it increases the incentive for India to build coalitions among like‑minded states (regional and global) to press for verification standards and non‑discriminatory arrangements. Conversely, Chinese willingness to engage constructively on specific agenda items can create openings for Indian diplomacy.  
- Doctrinal signalling: China’s declared NFU and constrained arsenal size influence Indian debates on minimal credible deterrence vs. arsenal expansion, particularly in the context of strategic stability and arms‑control talks. India observes P5 behaviour closely to determine whether formal limits would be stable and enforceable, or whether they would freeze an unfavourable distribution of capabilities.

Ambiguities, dataset recommendations, and methodological safeguards
- Clarify the intent of “Group of One”: is it a membership tag, an authorship marker, or a placeholder? The record should state that explicitly.  
- Standardize entries: require at minimum (a) ISO country code, (b) delegation head and mission, (c) date(s) of participation, (d) summary of positions (<= 150 words), (e) links or citations to primary texts (statements, working papers). This prevents single‑word entries from impairing comparative analysis.  
- Metadata and provenance: include provenance fields (source document, page/paragraph, transcriber) and a confidence flag (e.g., confirmed, inferred, placeholder) so users can triage incomplete entries efficiently.  
- Analytical annotation: for each state entry in the CD dataset include an “implications for India” short note to connect multilateral behaviour to India’s strategic options — this aids both policy relevance and scholarly use.

Concise scholarly summary
The isolated entry “China” under “Group of One” is an under‑specified record that likely signals China acting as a sole sponsor or actor on a CD item, or else a placeholder awaiting fuller documentation. Given China’s P5 status, declared NFU, treaty positions (CTBT ratification, cautious stance on FMCT), and preference for consensus and sovereignty‑sensitive outcomes, any Chinese single‑actor initiative in the Conference on Disarmament is consequential for India’s arms‑control calculations and deterrence policy. To render the entry useful for analysis of India’s strategic culture, it should be expanded with delegation details, primary texts, and a short analytic brief explaining implications for New Delhi; more broadly, the dataset should adopt standardized metadata fields to remove ambiguity and support rigorous comparative research.

Recommended immediate next steps for the researcher/archivist
1. Locate the primary CD record associated with this entry (meeting date, statement transcript, working paper).  
2. Populate the standardized metadata fields recommended above.  
3. Draft a 100–150 word analytic brief linking China’s stated position in that instance to Indian strategic responses (diplomatic, doctrinal, capability).  
4. Where applicable, annotate the entry with whether China acted alone, coordinated with the P5, or joined a coalition — this distinction matters for assessing leverage and likely outcomes in the CD.

### Non‑Member Participants at the Conference on Disarmament — composition, meaning and implications for Indian strategic policy

Summary
- The Conference on Disarmament (CD) in Geneva admits, alongside its formal membership, a number of states that attend meetings as “Non‑member States.” The list below identifies those states that have been recorded as participating in CD meetings in such a capacity. These participants are not formal members of the CD but attend to observe, make statements (when permitted), and engage diplomatically with the negotiators present.

List of Non‑member States recorded as participating
- Albania, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Greece, Guatemala, Holy See, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao PDR (Laos), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Montenegro, Nicaragua, North Macedonia, Oman, Panama, Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Moldova, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Togo, United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Legal and procedural implications of “Non‑member” participation
- Status: Non‑member participants typically attend as observers or invited participants under the CD’s modalities for participation. They do not enjoy the procedural rights of full members (notably they do not vote, do not hold membership chairs, and have limited influence over internal CD procedure).
- Practical entitlements: Attendance at plenaries and many subsidiary meetings, opportunities to deliver national statements (subject to the Chair’s permission and meeting rules), bilateral engagements with delegations, and access to some documentary material.
- Constraint and opportunity: The lack of formal voting or agenda-setting authority restricts direct procedural influence, but the platform still allows substantive normative and diplomatic engagement.

Why states attend the CD as non‑members
- Follow negotiations: To track developments on arms control instruments (e.g., FMCT, negative security assurances, nuclear disarmament norm debates).
- Policy signalling: To communicate national positions to both CD membership and the wider international community.
- Networking and coalition building: To cultivate relationships with member states, technical experts, and civil society actors present in Geneva.
- Technical learning and capacity building: To obtain technical information, legal drafting practice, and exposure to multilateral negotiation dynamics.
- Membership calculus: Attendance can be a step toward deeper engagement—observer status or eventual membership—if desirable and feasible.

Regional distribution and what it reveals
- Geography: The non‑member list spans Europe and the Balkans (many post‑Cold War and EU/Euro‑Atlantic states), Latin America and the Caribbean, Southeast and Central Asia, the Gulf, and a small African presence.
- Interpretation: The broad geographic spread indicates that CD issues resonate beyond the formal membership; many states want to be involved in disarmament diplomacy even if they are not full members. For regions such as the Gulf and Southeast Asia, participation reflects acute regional security concerns tied to proliferation and conventional risks.

Notable entries and their signals
- Holy See: As a non‑state observer, the Holy See’s presence signals a moral and ethical engagement with disarmament debates—useful when framing normative arguments on humanitarian consequences of weapons.
- Gulf states (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, UAE): Their participation signals concern about regional stability, maritime security and chemical/nuclear proliferation risks; they may seek to influence non‑proliferation norms from a regional security perspective.
- ASEAN‑related and South Asian ties (Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Lao PDR): Southeast Asian attendance reflects regional interest in normative and legal measures against proliferation and in confidence‑building mechanisms.
- European/Balkan entries: Many reflect the post‑Cold War expansion of diplomatic engagement with security multilateralism.

Strategic implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Opportunity for outreach: India—whose strategic culture values autonomy, normative leadership on disarmament and responsible nuclear stewardship—can use non‑member participation to broaden coalitions on priorities such as a verifiable FMCT, a non‑discriminatory approach to disarmament, or negotiating language on no first use and negative security assurances.
- Soft power and normative engagement: India can cultivate support among non‑members (especially from the Global South and Asia) for its positions, reinforcing its image as a responsible nuclear power and building diplomatic capital in Geneva fora.
- Intelligence and diplomatic payoff: Monitoring which non‑members attend and their statements helps India anticipate regional security priorities (e.g., Gulf states’ concerns) and tailor bilateral outreach.
- Risk management: India should note that greater inclusiveness at the CD can dilute consensus positions held by core negotiating blocs; it must therefore adapt coalition strategies to account for a more pluralized set of voices.
- Capacity building: India can assist interested non‑members (e.g., small states) with technical expertise, thereby strengthening networks sympathetic to India’s disarmament prescriptions.

Possible next steps for listed states — and implications for Indian diplomacy
- Paths for non‑members: pursue observer status in other UN disarmament fora, increase diplomatic presence in Geneva, seek full CD membership where possible, or specialize in niche issues (humanitarian consequences, verification technology).
- For India: proactively engage these non‑members through bilateral diplomacy and multilateral outreach to build issue‑based coalitions (for example, on verification protocols or regional non‑proliferation measures), and to shape draft text and norms before formal negotiations reach committee stages.

Caveats and practical advice
- Lists are fluid: Participant statuses and attendance change with sessions, national priorities and resource constraints. For operational use (e.g., diplomatic planning, legal briefs) verify participant lists against the CD’s current documentation and UN records for the session in question.
- Use for analysts and practitioners: This list serves to identify potential interlocutors and stakeholders in disarmament diplomacy. It is a starting point for mapping influence networks and designing outreach strategies.

Conclusion — relevance to the book’s theme
- The presence of numerous non‑member states at the CD exemplifies the pluralization of multilateral disarmament diplomacy. For India’s strategic culture—which balances sovereign autonomy, normative leadership, and pragmatic coalition‑building—understanding and engaging with these non‑member participants is an instrument of both policy influence and security diplomacy. Effective engagement amplifies India’s capacity to shape outcomes in fora where procedural membership does not tell the whole story.
