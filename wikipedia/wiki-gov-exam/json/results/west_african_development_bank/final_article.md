### Case study: West African Development Bank (WADB / BOAD / BDOA)

Identification and nomenclature
- The institution under review is an international multilateral development bank established to finance and support socio‑economic development in West Africa.  
- Official names and acronyms: in English the West African Development Bank (WADB); in French Banque Ouest Africaine de Développement (BOAD); and in Portuguese Banco de Desenvolvimento do Oeste Africano (BDOA). Awareness of these three acronyms is important when consulting documents or negotiating partnerships across linguistic lines.

Founding date and headquarters
- Year of establishment: 1973, marking the bank as a long‑standing regional development actor whose institutional memory and evolving mandate reflect decades of West African economic integration efforts.  
- Headquarters: Lomé, Togo — geographically situated to serve the coastal and interior economies of the region.

Geographic and member scope
- Primary geographic focus: the francophone and lusophone countries of West Africa, reflecting colonial‑era linguistic groupings that continue to shape regional institutional architectures.  
- Member states (shareholders and principal stakeholders): Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea‑Bissau, Côte d’Ivoire, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo.

Organisational structure and governance
- The WADB is organised under a multilateral ownership model: it is governed by its member governments in conjunction with the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO). This dual relationship — between sovereign shareholders and the regional central bank — embeds the bank within regional monetary and economic integration frameworks.  
- Multilateral ownership implies that strategic direction, project selection and financial policies are shaped by intergovernmental negotiation and donor‑recipient dynamics; external funders and international partners frequently influence programming through co‑financing and conditionalities.

Funding sources and core functions
- Core funding derives from a mix of capital contributions by member states and operational financing provided by foreign governments and international agencies. As with many regional MDBs, this blended financing model enables leveraging of limited national resources through external concessional funding and syndicated loans.  
- Typical functions: project financing (infrastructure, social sectors, agriculture), sectoral investments, and development policy support (technical assistance, capacity building, policy loans). The bank’s instruments and sector priorities are designed to promote regional development and integration.

Institutional linkages and operational characteristics
- The connection to the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) suggests institutional coordination with regional monetary policy and economic integration mechanisms (currency stability, payment systems, and macroeconomic surveillance). This linkage increases the WADB’s potential role in financing projects that are complementary to monetary and fiscal convergence objectives.  
- Serving both francophone and lusophone countries requires multilingual operations (primarily French and Portuguese) and an ability to manage cross‑border mandates, legal regimes and administrative traditions.

Implications for external actors — relevance to India’s strategic posture
- For a middle power such as India, the WADB presents a targeted platform for economic diplomacy in West Africa. Engagement options include co‑financing, lines of credit, technical assistance, and capacity building that align Indian development cooperation with regional priorities.  
- Strategic considerations: partnering with a regional MDB allows India to deploy development finance in ways that respect regional ownership and institutions while enhancing India’s visibility vis‑à‑vis other external actors (notably China and the EU). Coordination with BCEAO‑led frameworks also offers entry points to support projects that reinforce macroeconomic stability and inter‑state connectivity — factors with downstream implications for trade, investment and security.  
- Operational caution: India must navigate multilateral governance norms, donor coordination mechanisms, and linguistic/administrative pluralism; recognising the bank’s long institutional trajectory (since 1973) helps in designing sustainable, locally‑anchored partnerships.

Concluding note
- The WADB/BOAD/BDOA exemplifies how regional multilateral development banks combine political ownership, technical finance and integrationist aims. For policymakers concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, such institutions are both instruments and arenas of influence — enabling development cooperation that advances economic ties while engaging with regional governance structures.

### The West African Development Bank (BOAD): Origins, Evolution and Strategic Role

Summary
- Institution: BOAD (Banque Ouest Africaine de Développement / West African Development Bank)  
- Creation date: 14 November 1973  
- Founding actors: member states of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU)  
- Original charter purposes: to finance and foster balanced economic development within member states; to prepare member economies for deeper regional economic integration  
- Major organisational change: in 1994 BOAD was designated the development arm of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU / UEMOA)  
- Headquarters: Lomé, Togo

Founding rationale and original mandate
BOAD was created on 14 November 1973 by the states of the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) as a regional development bank tailored to the particularity of the francophone West African monetary zone. Its original charter reflected two complementary objectives. First, BOAD was conceived as a financial instrument to promote balanced socio‑economic development across member countries through project financing, concessional lending and technical support. Second, it was explicitly tasked with preparing and enabling member economies to move toward deeper regional economic integration — an objective understood to be both economic (harmonisation of policies, facilitation of intra‑regional trade and investment) and political (building institutional trust and interdependence).

Institutional context: WAMU, WAEMU and the CFA franc zone
BOAD’s creation and evolution cannot be separated from the institutional architecture of the francophone West African monetary space. WAMU (the West African Monetary Union), and later WAEMU/UEMOA (the West African Economic and Monetary Union, established by treaty in 1994), are regional arrangements closely associated with the CFA franc monetary zone. These arrangements combine a common currency and central banking arrangements with supranational economic policy instruments. BOAD was designed to sit within — and to support — that currency‑area governance structure by delivering development finance calibrated to the constraints and opportunities of a monetary union.

Core functions and operational modalities
BOAD’s typical operational roles have been:
- Project financing: long‑term financing for infrastructure, agriculture, energy, transport and other development projects that have cross‑border or national development significance.  
- Public‑sector lending: concessional or preferential loans extended to member states for public investment programs.  
- Technical assistance: provision of capacity building, project preparation and policy advice to improve project readiness and institutional capacity.  
- Support for regional programs: financing and co‑financing of projects that directly advance regional integration objectives (cross‑border infrastructure, institutional harmonisation, trade facilitation).

The 1994 organisational shift: becoming WAEMU’s development arm
In 1994 BOAD was formally designated the development arm of WAEMU (UEMOA). This change was more than nominal. It signalled a formal and operational alignment between BOAD’s financing agenda and WAEMU’s integration and convergence architecture. Practically, becoming WAEMU’s development arm implied:
- A broadened mandate to finance projects that directly support WAEMU convergence criteria and policy objectives (fiscal harmonisation, price stability, structural reforms).  
- Greater emphasis on regional, as opposed to purely national, projects — thereby making BOAD a vehicle for implementing cross‑border integration initiatives.  
- Closer institutional coordination with WAEMU bodies, enhancing the bank’s role in translating regional policy into financed action.

Implications for regional development and security
The evolution of BOAD illustrates how regional development banks can serve dual economic and strategic functions. By financing integration‑oriented infrastructure and supporting macroeconomic convergence, BOAD contributes to economic stability and interdependence — conditions that reduce the likelihood of interstate tension and create a platform for cooperative security arrangements. In weakly institutionalised regions, such banks can therefore be instruments of both development and resilient regional governance.

Relevance for an Indian strategic perspective
For a reader concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, BOAD offers salient lessons and potential avenues for engagement:
- Instrumental logic: BOAD exemplifies how finance institutions are instruments of regional statecraft — using development finance to bind states into shared policies and infrastructures that generate strategic stability. India’s own use of development assistance and lines of credit in Africa reflects similar thinking about economic statecraft and soft power.  
- Partnering opportunities: Indian development finance institutions (Export–Import Bank of India, development agencies) can engage BOAD as a co‑financer or technical partner when Indian firms participate in regional projects, thereby leveraging local ownership and regional mandates.  
- Institutional design lessons: BOAD’s alignment with a monetary and economic union shows the value of anchoring finance institutions to broader governance frameworks when the goal is structural integration — a consideration for Indo‑Pacific initiatives that aim for regional public goods rather than ad hoc bilateral projects.

Conclusion
BOAD’s creation in 1973 and its 1994 re‑positioning as WAEMU’s development arm exemplify how regional development banks evolve in response to shifts in regional governance. Its mandate — project financing, public loans, technical assistance and support for regional programs — positions it as both an economic and strategic actor within the CFA franc zone. For policymakers and strategists studying instruments of economic statecraft, BOAD is a concise case of how development finance can be institutionalised to advance integration, stability and regional resilience.

## International Membership, Governance and Strategic Implications

This section examines the role of international institutional members within a major regional development bank serving the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA). Although the focal institution is regional in character and ultimately accountable to UEMOA member states, the participation of multilateral and bilateral financiers—among them the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European Investment Bank (EIB), Export–Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) and the People’s Bank of China (PBoC)—has important operational, governance and strategic consequences. The analysis below draws out the bank’s governance arrangements, the functions and effects of international membership, and the specific implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### Composition and contribution of international members
- Several international organisations have become formal members of the bank. These include continental and regional development institutions (for example, AfDB), European multilateral lenders (EIB), and bilateral development finance institutions from major global partners (notably Exim Bank of India and, in practice though less commonly in this form, Chinese state financial entities such as the PBoC or policy banks).
- Membership by multilateral and bilateral finance institutions brings three principal benefits:
  - Capital: direct financing for lending windows, co‑financing of projects and increased balance‑sheet capacity.
  - Technical expertise: project appraisal, standards for procurement, environmental and social safeguards, and capacity building.
  - Political and diplomatic influence: the ability to shape agenda‑setting, prioritize sectors, and signal geopolitical interest.

### Board representation and the politics of membership
- International members are not merely financiers: they typically have formal board representation (i.e., seats on the bank’s board). This entitles them both to participate in governance and to exercise influence over strategic and operational decisions.
- Crucially, however, the bank’s board presidency is selected by UEMOA heads of state—an explicit institutional mechanism that preserves regional political control over the bank’s overarching governance. This design means that, despite the presence of influential external actors, ultimate political authority rests with the union’s member governments.
- The outline notes that since January 2008 Abdoulaye Bio‑Tchane has been board president; this datum should be treated cautiously and verified for currency in any policy analysis, as leadership posts in such institutions change and up‑to‑date information is essential for operational planning.

### Operational leadership and administrative structure
- Day‑to‑day operations are administered by the Bank’s President and an administrative manager, supported by a cabinet and departmental directorships based in Lomé (the capital of Togo), which serves as the bank’s administrative headquarters.
- To implement and supervise programmes on the ground, the bank maintains mission offices inside its member countries. These offices perform vital functions: project oversight, coordination with national authorities, stakeholder engagement and rapid response to implementation issues. They are also the primary interface between the bank and local political and business networks.

### Strategic dynamics: competing priorities and diversified funding
- The participation of diverse institutional members produces both strengths and tensions:
  - Strengths: a diversified funding base reduces reliance on any single creditor, broadens the menu of available instruments (concessional loans, guarantees, technical assistance), and permits knowledge transfer from different development traditions.
  - Tensions: different members bring different policy priorities, procurement rules and political aims. This can produce friction over project selection, conditionality, environmental and social safeguards, and procurement practices.
- The presence of India’s Exim Bank and Chinese financial entities signals an expanding Global South footprint in West African development finance; concomitantly, AfDB and EIB membership tie the bank to continental and European development agendas. The net effect is a complex multilateral marketplace in which regional priorities intersect with the strategic interests of external partners.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For Indian policymakers, Exim Bank membership in a UEMOA‑linked regional bank should be read as a deliberate instrument of economic statecraft, carrying implications across diplomacy, trade, and security:

- Instrumentalizing development finance: India traditionally prefers partnership‑based development assistance. Exim Bank’s presence provides India with a formal, programmatic vehicle to advance infrastructure and trade‑related projects, deepen economic ties, and cultivate political goodwill in francophone West Africa—an area where India’s historical footprint has been modest compared with Anglophone Africa.
- Competition and coordination with China: Chinese state banks and policy lenders pursue high‑visibility infrastructure projects which tend to secure strategic footholds. India’s finance arm must therefore calibrate engagement—seeking niches where it can be competitive (e.g., lines of credit for goods and services supplied by Indian firms, capacity building) and avoid direct duplication that would overstretch resources or create counterproductive rivalry.
- Security of investments and critical links: greater Indian financial exposure in the region raises national security questions—protection of investments, safety of personnel, and continuity of supply chains. India’s strategic culture, which increasingly integrates economic tools into security calculus, must therefore include risk assessment frameworks and contingency planning for its developmental engagements.
- Influence over governance norms: by participating in a bank alongside AfDB and EIB, India gains partial voice in shaping governance, procurement and safeguard standards. This can be leveraged to promote transparency and locally appropriate modalities, but also requires India to adopt higher standards domestically for credibility.
- Balancing respect for regional sovereignty with strategic aims: the institutional rule that UEMOA heads of state select the board president illustrates that external actors, including India, must operate within structures that prioritize regional political control. Successful Indian engagement will therefore be sensitive to regional governance prerogatives and oriented toward partnership rather than dominance.

### Practical recommendations for Indian policy and practice
- Use Exim Bank membership strategically: prioritize projects that deliver clear economic and reputational returns—trade‑enabling infrastructure, small‑and‑medium enterprise linkages, vocational training that uses Indian technical expertise.
- Strengthen interagency coordination: synchronize Exim Bank activities with the Ministry of External Affairs, Indian defence diplomacy where relevant (e.g., protecting lines of communication), and private sector exporters to produce coherent policy outcomes.
- Invest in local presence and safeguards: encourage Exim Bank to deepen resident engagement (mission offices, project monitoring) and align with internationally accepted environmental and social safeguards to avoid reputational costs.
- Monitor governance developments closely: because regional political control over the bank remains entrenched (board president chosen by UEMOA heads), India should cultivate bilateral ties with member states and participate constructively in board processes rather than attempt to exert unilateral influence.
- Maintain open channels with other donors: where possible, pursue co‑financing and technical partnerships with AfDB, EIB and other multilateral actors to amplify impact and manage competition with China through cooperation rather than confrontation.

Conclusion
The bank’s model—regional political control complemented by international institutional membership—creates a hybrid governance space in which capital, expertise and political influence intersect. For India, participation via Exim Bank is a practical manifestation of its evolving strategic culture: using development finance as an instrument of influence while operating within multilateral and regional frameworks. Managing the benefits and frictions of diverse membership will require deliberate policy design, robust interagency coordination, and an appreciation that regional political ownership (via UEMOA) remains the decisive factor in governance.

### Case study: BOAD’s 2001–2002 strategic reorientation

Brief overview  
The Banque Ouest‑Africaine de Développement (BOAD, West African Development Bank) undertook a deliberate reorientation of its mission in 2001–2002. What had previously been an institution focused largely on long‑ and medium‑term public lending broadened its objectives and instruments to emphasise poverty reduction, regional economic integration and private‑sector development. The changes illustrate how multilateral development banks adapted in the early 2000s—and offer transferable lessons for states (including India) thinking about development finance as an instrument of economic security and strategic influence.

Revised mission and strategic goals (2001)  
- BOAD’s 2001 mission statement foregrounded three primary development goals: poverty reduction, economic integration of West African states, and promotion of private‑sector activity.  
- This reframing signalled a shift in priorities from purely public‑infrastructure financing toward interventions intended to generate employment, raise living standards and knit markets across borders—objectives with clear socio‑economic and stability payoffs.

Changes in lending practices and instruments (2002)  
- Historically BOAD predominantly disbursed long‑ and medium‑term loans to member governments and public institutions for development projects.  
- In 2002 the bank expanded its borrower base to include private businesses that implemented projects of regional significance, marking an institutional embrace of private‑sector actors as partners in development.  
- BOAD also began offering lines of credit to intermediary institutions to finance micro‑credit programmes and small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Targeting microfinance and SMEs was explicitly intended to foster grassroots employment, inclusion and livelihood resilience—key elements of sustainable poverty reduction.  
- The emphasis on projects of “regional importance” meant prioritising cross‑border or multicountry investments that furthered economic integration (transport corridors, energy interconnectors, regional agribusiness value chains).

Conditional debt‑relief programming  
- BOAD provided funds to support member governments’ debt‑relief measures. These resources were not unconditional: recipient governments committed to redirect the budgetary savings generated by relief into social and productive sectors—principally health (with a notable focus on HIV/AIDS), education and infrastructure.  
- Such conditionality aligned BOAD with contemporaneous international development norms that linked fiscal relief to measurable human‑development and poverty‑reduction outcomes.

Institutional consequences and risk management  
- Opening lending to private enterprises and to microfinance intermediaries materially increased BOAD’s credit‑ and market‑risk exposure. This expansion likely required:  
  - revised credit appraisal methodologies tailored to SMEs and non‑sovereign borrowers;  
  - strengthened portfolio monitoring and provisioning;  
  - enhanced governance and compliance functions; and  
  - possible adjustments to capital adequacy and co‑financing arrangements with partners and donors.  
- These operational shifts reflect the broader trade‑off development banks confronted: leveraging private activity for development gains while managing a more complex, riskier asset mix.

Alignment with global trends and strategic significance  
- BOAD’s policy evolution mirrors early‑2000s trends among development finance institutions: an explicit poverty focus, greater promotion of private‑sector participation, and the use of social‑spending conditionality linked to debt relief and aid effectiveness agendas.  
- Strategically, these moves reflect an understanding that economic integration and inclusive growth are intrinsic to regional stability—thus linking development finance directly to security and resilience objectives.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
- Economic instruments as strategic tools: BOAD’s shift underlines how development banks can be deployed to promote economic resilience and regional cohesion—components increasingly treated as national‑security concerns. India’s own approach to overseas development finance and engagement with African institutions can draw on this model to balance developmental impact and strategic influence.  
- Private‑sector finance and risk governance: India’s export‑credit and development concessional finance mechanisms (e.g., EXIM Bank lines of credit) face similar trade‑offs when financing private actors abroad. BOAD’s experience highlights the operational necessity of robust credit appraisal and risk‑mitigation frameworks if states want to scale private‑sector engagement without exposing sovereign balance sheets.  
- Conditionality and soft power: Redirecting debt‑relief savings to health, education and infrastructure boosts human security and generates visible social gains—useful both for internal stability and for enhancing an external partner’s legitimacy. India’s diplomatic and development engagements can employ similar conditionality to align recipient spending with mutual strategic priorities (public‑health cooperation, capacity building, connectivity).  
- Microfinance, SMEs and stability: Support for micro‑credit and SMEs fosters employment and inclusion at the grassroots level, reducing socioeconomic drivers of instability. This links development finance directly to preventive security strategies relevant to states pursuing long‑term stability in partner regions.

Concluding note  
BOAD’s 2001–2002 reorientation exemplifies how a regional development bank recalibrated its mission and instruments to marry poverty reduction, regional integration and private‑sector promotion. For scholars of strategic culture and for policymakers, the BOAD case underscores that development finance is both a technical and a strategic instrument—one that requires institutional adaptation to manage risk while advancing human‑security and geopolitical objectives.

### Headquarters in Lomé: Architecture, Location, and Strategic Significance

The West African Development Bank’s headquarters sits in Lomé, Togo, in a seven‑storey modernist building designed by the French architects Durand, Ménard, and Thiébault and completed around 1980. This seemingly prosaic description contains multiple layers of institutional meaning—geographic, architectural, historical and strategic—that are important when we read international organizations as actors within states’ strategic cultures.

- Location: Lomé as strategic choice  
  Lomé is more than the Togolese capital; it is a regional port and administrative hub on the Gulf of Guinea. Placing a pan‑West African financial institution there signals practical access to maritime trade routes, ease of movement for member‑state delegations, and proximity to regional bureaucratic networks. For the host state, securing the headquarters confers prestige and a permanent seat at the table of regional decision‑making.

- Building scale and internal function: seven storeys as operational marker  
  A mid‑rise, seven‑storey headquarters is modest but substantive. It suggests an institution sized primarily for administrative, representative, and operational functions rather than grand ceremonial display. The scale indicates capacity for core departments, meeting rooms for delegates, and enough staff to sustain day‑to‑day development finance operations without the footprint of a large supranational secretariat.

- Architectural style: modernism as message  
  The choice of modernist architecture—clean lines, functional planning, an emphasis on rational form—functions as a visual argument. Modernism traditionally signals institutional modernity, technical competence and progression away from colonial pasts toward bureaucratic rationality. For member governments and external partners, the building’s style contributes to the bank’s public legitimacy and professional image.

- Designers and political‑cultural ties: French architects and Francophone links  
  That the design team comprised French architects is emblematic of enduring linguistic, cultural and technical ties between Francophone West Africa and France. Employing French designers can reflect practical capacities (architectural firms with international experience), donor and technical assistance linkages, and soft‑power continuities embedded in post‑colonial institutional construction.

- Temporal context: 1980 and post‑independence institution‑building  
  The circa‑1980 date places the headquarters in a post‑independence wave of state and regional institution building. This period saw African states and regional bodies erecting durable administrative infrastructure to embody sovereignty, cooperation and developmental ambitions. The building, therefore, is both a functional asset and an artifact of a specific moment in regional political history.

Key implications for strategic analysis and policy

- Host‑state politics and institutional standing  
  The placement in Lomé underscores Togo’s institutional importance within the bank’s membership. Headquarters location can influence informal networks, local access for visiting delegations, and the distribution of prestige among member states—factors that shape bargaining and governance.

- Symbolism, legitimacy and external perception  
  Architectural style and the use of foreign designers are part of the bank’s external presentation. Such choices help construct perceptions of competence and continuity for international partners, donors and markets—an important dimension for development finance institutions whose effectiveness depends on trust and credibility.

- Lifecycle, resilience and security considerations  
  A building designed in 1980 will have materially aged. From an operational and security standpoint this raises concrete issues: maintenance, energy efficiency, vulnerability to climate effects, and the necessity of retrofitting for contemporary information security and physical protection standards. Those practical matters affect not only daily functionality but also resilience in crisis—critical for institutions that coordinate regional responses.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Although this case is West African, the analytic lessons are directly relevant to India’s strategic culture and institutional policy. Where an organization is headquartered, what its premises look like, who designs them and when they were built are not neutral—they are instruments of statecraft. For Indian policymakers and strategists considering the establishment, hosting, or support of regional and multilateral institutions, attention to site selection, architectural symbolism, local political benefits, and long‑term infrastructure lifecycle (including security retrofits and climate resilience) should form part of the strategic calculus. These material and symbolic choices shape legitimacy, influence, and operational continuity—core concerns of national security policy in an interconnected world.

## Figure captions: BOAD, Lomé, Togo (1981)

This short gallery entry — repeated twice in the source list as “BOAD, Lomé, Togo, 1981” — requires careful treatment. Photographic and archival captions are not mere labels: they are primary-document metadata that underpin rigorous historical and policy analysis. Below I unpack the entry, explain likely causes of duplication, propose a corrected captioning standard, place the image(s) in institutional context, and explain why such material matters for a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### 1. Immediate reading and breakdown
- Caption elements as given:
  - BOAD — the abbreviated institutional name used as the caption’s core identifier.
  - Lomé, Togo — geographic location consistent with BOAD’s headquarters.
  - 1981 — year associated with the item (date of photo, visit or event).
- Duplicate entry:
  - The caption appears twice, identically. This can indicate (a) two distinct but visually similar images from the same subject/year, or (b) an accidental duplication in the catalogue.

### 2. Institutional and historical context (concise)
- BOAD is the Banque Ouest‑Africaine de Développement (West African Development Bank), headquartered in Lomé. It is a regional development finance institution that channels investment for public and private projects across its member states.
- The year 1981 situates any visual material in an early operational phase for BOAD. Images from that period can illustrate institutional architecture, ceremonial practice, and diplomatic exchange — all useful for comparative studies of regional development banks.

### 3. Why accurate captions matter for strategic-culture research
- Photographs are evidence of institutional presence, stagecraft, and external relations. For scholars of strategic culture and national security policy, such images can:
  - Show how regional institutions project modernity and governance in their built environment.
  - Reveal staging of diplomatic encounters, donor relationships, or foreign delegations — elements relevant to patterns of influence and partnership.
  - Provide provenance for claims about international engagement in a given region and period.
- Errors or missing metadata (date, provenance, licence) undermine the evidentiary value of images and can lead to misinterpretation in qualitative analysis.

### 4. Recommended metadata fields (minimum standard for academic use)
Every gallery item should include:
- Full caption/subject description (what is pictured: building façade, inauguration, delegation, interior, etc.)
- Institution (expanded name and abbreviation): “Banque Ouest‑Africaine de Développement (BOAD)”
- Place (city, country)
- Date (day/month/year if available; otherwise at least year)
- Photographer / credit
- Source/archive (collection name, accession/catalogue number)
- Rights and usage licence (copyright holder, permitted uses)
- Brief provenance/notes (context: event, purpose of photo)
- Digital file identifier (if in an electronic repository)

### 5. Practical caption templates and examples
- If the two entries are the same photo (duplicate):
  - Remove the duplicate and use one enriched caption, for example:
    - “BOAD headquarters façade, Lomé, Togo. 1981. Photographer: [Name]. Source: [Archive], Accession no. [0000]. Rights: [holder/licence]. Note: Photo taken during [event/visit] (if known).”
- If two distinct photos (e.g., building exterior and inauguration ceremony):
  - Caption A: “BOAD headquarters façade, Lomé, Togo. 1981. Photographer: [Name]. Source: [Archive]. Rights: [holder].”
  - Caption B: “Inauguration/official ceremony at BOAD, Lomé, Togo, 12 March 1981. Delegation includes [if known]. Photographer: [Name]. Source: [Archive]. Rights: [holder].”
- Where precise dates or credits are unknown, flag the uncertainty rather than omit it:
  - “Date approximated to 1981 (archive label). Photographer unknown.”

### 6. Archival best practice and recommendations
- Confirm whether there are one or two distinct images. If duplicate, delete the redundant entry and keep a single, fully documented caption.
- Where possible, consult the holding archive for accession records to recover photographer, exact date, and event description.
- Add cross‑references to related archival material: BOAD annual reports, meeting minutes, or project files from the early 1980s that can contextualize the image.
- Assign an internal catalogue number and preserve provenance metadata to support future scholarly citation.

### 7. Relevance to a book on India’s strategic culture and national security policy (brief)
- Comparative institutional images like those of BOAD are useful analytic tools. India’s evolving approach to external economic statecraft — lines of credit, engagement with regional development banks, infrastructure diplomacy — is best understood in comparative perspective. Archival photographs of regional development banks demonstrate how other states and institutions present themselves, cultivate partnerships, and anchor regional influence.
- Accurate captions and provenance enable: (a) tracking of India’s visual and material diplomacy in regions where it seeks strategic partnerships, and (b) rigorous source attribution when using images as evidence in arguments about perception, presence, and policy signalling.

Concluding recommendation: treat the duplicate “BOAD, Lomé, Togo, 1981” entries as a prompt to enrich and standardize gallery metadata. That short investment in archival rigor multiplies the scholarly value of the image for institutional history and for comparative analyses relevant to India’s strategic posture.
