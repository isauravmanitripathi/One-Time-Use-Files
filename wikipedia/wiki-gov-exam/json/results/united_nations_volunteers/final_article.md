### Intergovernmental organization (1970–): The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) Programme

Background and institutional identity  
- The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme was established in 1970 and sits within the intergovernmental architecture of the United Nations. Although it is administered by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNV retains a distinct normative and operational mandate focused on volunteerism as both an instrument and value of development and peacebuilding. Administratively, UNV uses UNDP systems for finance, human resources and oversight and reports to the UNDP Executive Board, reflecting its integrated yet discrete status within the UN system. The programme’s headquarters is in Bonn, Germany, and it maintains six regional offices alongside multiple country field units.

Mandate and strategic purpose  
- UNV has a dual mandate. First, it mobilizes and places UN Volunteers with UN entities (agencies, funds and programmes) and partner institutions to deliver technical assistance, capacity building, community development and humanitarian response. Second, it acts as an advocate and normative promoter of volunteerism—seeking formal recognition of volunteers’ contribution to development and the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In practice this duality combines operational deployments with policy, advocacy and knowledge work to situate volunteerism as a recognized mechanism for achieving development outcomes.

Conceptual framing: volunteerism as development and peace practice  
- UNV frames volunteerism as universal, inclusive and diverse. It presents volunteerism not merely as episodic charitable activity but as a modality underpinned by values—free will, commitment, engagement and solidarity—that shape participatory, rights‑based approaches to development. According to UNV’s theory of change, volunteerism can transform both the pace and the nature of development: accelerating service delivery in crises, fostering social capital (trust, reciprocity and solidarity), and broadening civic participation and local ownership of development processes.

Operational scale, modalities and activities (2023 snapshot)  
- In 2023 UNV deployed nearly 13,000 UN Volunteers across more than 56 UN partner organizations and was active in around 130 countries annually. Volunteer roles span technical assistance, community development, training and capacity building, service delivery and surge humanitarian response. Modalities reflect operational diversity: volunteers may be international or national, and increasingly there are online/virtual volunteers—each modality suited to different needs, timelines and risk profiles. Deployments include short‑term surge responses (emergencies and humanitarian crises) and longer‑term assignments aimed at institutional strengthening and sustainable development outcomes.

Governance, partnerships and financing  
- Governance lines run through UNDP structures: UNV is administered by UNDP and reports to the UNDP Executive Board, but it collaborates horizontally across the UN system. UNV partners with UN agencies, host governments, civil society organizations and other stakeholders to identify needs, design volunteer assignments and share costs. Funding is typically blended: regular UN resources where available, earmarked donor contributions, and cost‑sharing arrangements with UN partner entities and host governments. This blended financing model allows flexibility but also exposes UNV to the usual UN funding volatility and donor conditionalities.

Normative and policy relevance to the SDGs  
- UNV explicitly links volunteerism to the SDGs. By deploying human resources where technical and community support are needed, and by advocating for policy recognition of volunteerism, UNV positions volunteers as both implementers and agents of the SDG agenda. Volunteer engagement is presented as reinforcing participatory governance, social inclusion and local resilience—attributes central to many SDG targets.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy (analytical sketch)  
- For a state like India—whose strategic culture prioritizes a mix of material capabilities, normative influence and sub‑regional leadership—UNV offers several relevant vectors:
  - Soft power and normative influence: Indian volunteers (national and diaspora) embedded in UNV assignments can extend India’s developmental diplomacy and enhance its image as a contributor to global public goods.
  - Human security and resilience: Volunteer modalities (especially in humanitarian surge and community development) align with human‑security approaches to national security—strengthening local resilience in neighbouring states can reduce instability spillovers that affect India’s strategic environment.
  - Capacity building and knowledge exchange: UNV deployments focused on technical assistance and institutional strengthening complement India’s bilateral development assistance by providing person‑centred, capacity‑driven interventions.
  - Civil‑military and whole‑of‑society responses: Volunteerism exemplifies non‑coercive instruments that can be integrated into disaster response and stabilization strategies, supporting roles in which Indian state and non‑state actors can cooperate internationally.
- These linkages do not render volunteerism a substitute for hard‑security instruments; rather, UNV illustrates how normative engagement and human capital projection are components of a comprehensive national security posture.

Concise summary  
- UNV is a UN programme (est. 1970), administered by UNDP and headquartered in Bonn, that mobilizes volunteerism for peace and development. It operates globally, advocating volunteerism as an inclusive, values‑based modality that supports the SDGs while providing operational personnel—national, international and virtual—for technical assistance, capacity building and humanitarian response. For India’s strategic culture and security policy, UNV offers avenues for soft power projection, human‑security practice and cooperative capacity building that complement traditional state instruments.

### The United Nations Volunteers (UNV): Origins, Institutional Trajectory, Leadership, and Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture

This short section traces the institutional genesis and evolution of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme, summarises its leadership lineage, and draws out implications for India’s strategic culture and national-security posture. The material synthesises the core facts in the outline while noting evidentiary gaps that a researcher should verify in primary UN records.

1. Origins and early consolidation
- The idea of a structured international volunteer service for development emerged in the 1960s out of a broader transnational volunteer movement. A formative moment was the 1962 International Conference on Middle Level Manpower convened by the United States Peace Corps in Puerto Rico, which promoted international volunteers as instruments for skills-transfer and institutional capacity-building in developing countries.
- From that milieu emerged the International Peace Corps Secretariat, later renamed the International Secretariat for Volunteer Service (ISVS). ISVS operated as a global civil-society/NGO precursor, advocating and coordinating volunteer deployment for development objectives worldwide.
- A catalytic external intervention occurred in June 1968 when Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi publicly proposed (in a Harvard address) the creation of a UN-based volunteers initiative. That proposal, combined with civil-society momentum, contributed to the United Nations General Assembly establishing a formal United Nations Volunteers entity in 1970.
- ISVS played an instrumental role in shaping and facilitating the transition to a UN-managed volunteer programme; following the institutionalisation of UNV, ISVS was dissolved in 1976 as volunteer administration consolidated under the UN framework. [Primary-source verification recommended: the exact UNGA resolution text and date establishing UNV.]

2. Mandate and functions (concise)
- UNV’s core mandate is to mobilise qualified volunteers to support United Nations objectives across peacebuilding, development, and capacity-building in member states. The programme has historically linked volunteer deployment to normative UN goals—human development, technical cooperation, and, increasingly, human security and disaster response. (Researchers should cite the current UNV mandate language from UN documentation for precise wording.)

3. Headquarters and the politics of location
- UNV’s original headquarters were in Geneva, Switzerland—placing it at the heart of the UN’s European institutional ecosystem.
- In 1996 the organisation relocated its headquarters to Bonn, Germany, taking up residence in Haus Carstanjen. A subsequent move in 2007 placed UNV in the former offices of the German Bundestag, also in Bonn.
- Such relocations reflect more than logistics: headquarters moves typically involve host-state incentives (financial, logistical, symbolic), alignment with national development or international-cooperation strategies, and considerations of partner networks. Germany’s hosting of UNV in Bonn is consistent with Bonn’s development as a UN and international-organisation hub and with German bilateral support for volunteerism and development cooperation.

4. Leadership chronology and institutional continuity
The UNV leadership list below records the executive coordinators named in the source outline. Several entries lack exact appointment or end dates and require verification against UN records; these gaps are noted.

- Assad K. Sadry (Iran) — 1970 — identified as the first Coordinator of UNV.  
- John Gordon (Canada) — appointed 1974 — [end date not provided in source].  
- Hikmat Nabulsi (Syria) — appointed 1977 — [exact dates not provided].  
- Edward White — served as Acting Executive Coordinator (a.i.) — [dates not provided].  
- Brenda Gael McSweeney (USA) — 1988–1997.  
- Sharon Capeling-Alakija (Canada) — 1 January 1998–November 2003 (died in office).  
- Ad de Raad (Netherlands) — Acting from November 2003; permanent from August 2004 through most of 2007.  
- Flavia Pansieri (Italy) — February 2008 through most of 2012.  
- Richard Dictus (Netherlands) — 2 January 2013 through most of 2016.  
- Olivier Adam (France) — 2 January 2017–31 December 2020.  
- Toily Kurbanov — 1 January 2021–present (nationality not specified in the provided text).

Observations on leadership: the list demonstrates geographic diversity—North America, Europe, the Middle East and, implicitly, Asia—reflecting UNV’s transnational constituency. The presence of several acting coordinators and some date uncertainties points to episodic transition periods and the need for precise archival cross-checking.

5. Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national-security policy
Although UNV is not a military or security organisation, its activities intersect with several elements of India’s evolving strategic culture and national-security thinking:
- Soft power and development diplomacy: Indian volunteerism (domestic and diaspora-based) complements state-led development diplomacy. Engagement with UNV enhances India’s image as a provider of human-capital assistance and development expertise, reinforcing non-coercive aspects of influence.
- Capacity-building and human security: UNV deployments in public health, education, and governance strengthen host-state resilience—objectives that align with India’s preference for human-security-centred cooperation in its neighbourhood and the wider Global South.
- Disaster response and stabilization: Volunteers often constitute flexible, technical teams that supplement humanitarian and disaster-response capabilities—areas where India both contributes to and benefits from multilateral coordination.
- Personnel diplomacy and normative leadership: Active participation in UNV programmes provides Indian professionals with exposure to UN norms and networks, thereby enhancing India’s ability to shape multilateral agendas in peacebuilding and development.
- Strategic calculation: Integrating volunteer diplomacy with defence diplomacy, economic assistance, and cultural outreach allows India to pursue layered influence without the direct use of force—consistent with a strategic culture that privileges prestige, sovereignty-respecting partnerships, and multilateral engagement.

6. Issues, gaps, and pointers for further research
- The source material omits specific UN General Assembly resolution references and contains gaps in dates and some nationalities (notably Toily Kurbanov). Scholars should consult UNGA records, UNV annual reports, and the UN Archives for authoritative dates and the formal mandate language.
- Investigate host-country agreements when UNV moved to Bonn (1996 and 2007) to understand the political and financial incentives behind the relocations.
- Examine how India has used UNV mechanisms (both as a contributor of volunteers and as a host) to advance strategic objectives; empirical country-level case studies would strengthen the linkage between volunteerism and national security outcomes.

Conclusion
UNV’s institutional trajectory—from a Peace Corps-era conference to an integrated UN programme headquartered in Bonn—illustrates how volunteerism was institutionalised within the multilateral system. For India, engagement with UNV offers a relatively low-cost, high-return avenue to project soft power, contribute to human security, and cultivate the human-capital networks that underpin long-term strategic influence. Exact governance details (founding resolutions, precise leadership dates) should be verified against primary UN documentation for scholarly accuracy.

## UN Volunteers (UNV): Structure, Modalities and Relevance to Strategic Culture

This section outlines the architecture and operational features of the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme and situates those features in relation to state-level strategic culture and national security policy, with an eye to implications for India. The presentation integrates core programme facts with analytical observations about why UNV exists, how it operates, and what its practices imply for capacity-building, peace operations and soft-power projection.

### Core facts and modalities

- Scale and deployment
  - UNV directly mobilizes, on average, 10,000 people as UN Volunteers every year. These volunteers operate both nationally and internationally, supporting development, humanitarian and peacekeeping activities across UN system entities.
  - Volunteers serve through three principal modalities:
    - National volunteers: deployed within their own country to support domestic programmes and build national capacities.
    - International volunteers: deployed to countries other than their country of origin, providing external expertise and cross-border capacity.
    - Online volunteers: contribute remotely via internet-based tasks, enabling short-term, skills-based engagement without physical deployment.

- Composition and demographics
  - Approximately 80% of UN Volunteers come from the Global South (broadly understood as low- and middle-income countries in Africa, Latin America, Asia and Oceania). This composition reflects UNV’s orientation toward locally grounded expertise and south–south cooperation.
  - As of 2023, roughly 64% of UN Volunteers serve within their own countries (domestic volunteering), underscoring a strong emphasis on localisation and the strengthening of national institutions.

- Role in peacekeeping and electoral/humanitarian support
  - UN Volunteers support a large number of peacekeeping and humanitarian projects and are a significant component of UN civilian presence in missions: they constitute approximately one third of all international civilian personnel in UN peacekeeping operations.
  - UN Volunteers routinely assist in organizing and running local and national elections, offer administrative and technical assistance in humanitarian responses, and support post-crisis recovery and development interventions.

- Eligibility, allowances and service terms
  - Minimum age to serve as a UN Volunteer is 18 years; there is no upper age limit, reflecting an age-inclusive policy designed to tap experience as well as youth energy.
  - UN Volunteers receive a Volunteer Living Allowance (VLA), paid monthly to cover basic living expenses. The VLA is not a salary; its amount varies by duty station and the local cost of living and is intended to sustain volunteers rather than to replicate full UN staff remuneration.
  - Assignment durations commonly range from several months to two years, calibrated to role requirements and mission needs. Volunteers generally receive pre-deployment orientation and on-assignment support, though they do not always receive the full range of UN staff benefits.

- Recruitment and diversity priorities
  - Recruitment typically requires registration with UNV, appropriate qualifications and experience for the role, and adherence to UN codes of conduct and safeguarding rules.
  - Gender balance and wider diversity (including geography, age and skills) are ongoing priorities; programme data are actively tracked to inform recruitment strategies and address gaps.

### Analytical observations — why these design choices matter

- Localisation and national capacity
  - The fact that 64% of UN Volunteers serve domestically and that 80% originate from the Global South demonstrates UNV’s explicit orientation toward localisation: strengthening national human resources, institutionalising skills domestically, and enabling countries to lead their own development agendas. For states, partnering with UNV is a force-multiplier for institutional capacity without necessarily creating long-term payroll obligations.

- Age inclusivity and human capital
  - The absence of an upper age limit permits mobilisation of experienced professionals and retirees, widening the talent pool to include senior expertise often scarce in crisis-priority sectors (e.g., post-conflict governance, electoral management). This supports knowledge transfer and mentorship alongside conventional youth engagement.

- Volunteers in peace operations
  - UNV’s provision of one third of international civilian personnel in peacekeeping operations signals strong institutional reliance on volunteer labour for core mission tasks. This reduces some personnel costs for the UN system while embedding a diverse mix of nationalities and perspectives into mission work—factors that can enhance cultural legitimacy but may complicate standardisation and continuity.

- Online volunteering and flexibility
  - The development of online volunteering expands the UN’s operational reach, allows for rapid, skills-based short-term engagements, and lowers deployment costs and security risks. For technologically capable states or diasporas, online modalities create new avenues for contribution that do not require physical relocation.

- Allowances and employment status
  - The VLA’s design—basic living coverage rather than a salary—maintains the volunteer character of the engagement while acknowledging humanitarian and ethical obligations to prevent exploitation. However, the difference between volunteer allowances and full staff benefits raises questions about retention, welfare in hazardous contexts, and post-assignment reintegration.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

- Soft power and international footprint
  - Engagement with UNV aligns with a strategic culture that prizes normative leadership and capacity-building in the neighbourhood and beyond. India, as a major actor in the Global South, can leverage volunteer exchanges and the UNV platform to project soft power, share administrative and technical expertise, and deepen bilateral ties through person-to-person diplomacy.

- Strengthening domestic resilience and human resources
  - The emphasis on domestic volunteering resonates with India’s own policy goals of decentralised capacity-building and community resilience (disaster response, public health, local governance). Indian nationals serving as UN Volunteers domestically or regionally can return with enhanced skills and networks, enriching civil services and non‑state capacities.

- Peacekeeping civilian components
  - Given the substantial role volunteers play in the civilian side of peace operations, strategic engagement with UNV helps ensure that India’s contribution to multilateral peace efforts goes beyond uniformed contingents to include civilian expertise—advancing comprehensive approaches to stability and reconstruction.

- Mobilising experienced personnel and diaspora
  - The absence of an upper age limit and the growth of online volunteering open pathways for retired officials, mid-career specialists and members of the Indian diaspora to contribute expertise remotely or in the field, supporting state policy without creating long-term fiscal obligations.

- Operational and normative considerations
  - Reliance on volunteers has trade-offs: while cost-effective and flexible, volunteer-based deployments can create challenges in continuity, professionalisation and welfare protections. For India, which increasingly places value on responsible international engagement, collaboration with UNV should be accompanied by attention to training standards, safeguarding, and post-assignment reintegration of returned volunteers into national systems.

### Short policy recommendations (for state actors interested in maximising UNV engagement)
- Promote awareness and recruitment pipelines among civil servants, technical experts, retirees and youth to harness the full age-diverse talent pool UNV allows.
- Support returnee reintegration through credit recognition, leadership placements and knowledge‑sharing platforms to convert volunteer experience into national capacity.
- Use online volunteering strategically to mobilise diaspora and specialists for short-term technical tasks, enhancing India’s digital development diplomacy.
- Advocate within UN fora for adequate volunteer welfare provisions that bridge the gap between allowances and full staff benefits in high-risk or highly technical roles.
- Track gender and diversity outcomes in national contributions to ensure UNV engagements advance domestic equity objectives as well as international commitments.

Conclusion
UNV’s structure—large-scale mobilisation, predominance of Global South nationals, a high share of domestic assignments, flexible age policy and a mix of physical and online modalities—reflects a deliberate design to couple international solidarity with localisation and capacity-building. For India, these features present concrete opportunities to project soft power, strengthen state capacity and integrate civilian expertise into broader security and development strategies, provided engagement is paired with clear domestic reintegration and welfare safeguards.

### The UN Volunteers Online Volunteering Service: Description, Functioning and Relevance to India's Strategic Culture

Summary  
The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) Online Volunteering Service is a web-based platform that connects skilled volunteers with development, humanitarian and governance projects worldwide. Launched in 2000 as part of NetAid and co-managed by NetAid until 2005, the platform allows NGOs, civil society organizations, governments and public institutions, UN agencies and other intergovernmental bodies to access remote, often highly skilled, volunteer input. The service operates in English, French and Spanish and in 2022 enabled over 8,000 people to contribute remotely. Importantly, online volunteers are legally and operationally volunteers of the partner organization with which they work; they are not UNV staff nor UNV-contracted volunteers and therefore do not receive UNV contracts or entitlements such as a Volunteer Living Allowance (VLA).

1. Origins and operational profile
- Genesis: The Online Volunteering Service originated within NetAid in 2000, reflecting an early institutional bet on internet-enabled volunteering that predated many contemporary digital volunteering initiatives. NetAid co-management continued through 2005, after which UNV assumed full stewardship and integrated the service into its broader volunteer architecture.
- Target users: The platform’s clientele includes non-governmental organizations, civil society bodies, national and subnational governments, public institutions, UN system entities and other intergovernmental organisations seeking remote expertise.
- Core function: Matchmaking — linking remote volunteers with project-specific tasks such as research, translation, project design, communications, monitoring and evaluation, data analysis, IT support, and policy advisory work.

2. Scope, scale and accessibility
- Language coverage: The platform’s interface and services are available in English, French and Spanish. This multilingual approach expands reach across large linguistic constituencies but still leaves many language communities under-served, creating a localization gap for speakers of other major world and local languages.
- Recent scale metric: In 2022 the service recorded participation by over 8,000 volunteers, indicating continued relevance and a sizable pool of qualified applicants for partner organisations.
- Accessibility benefits: Online volunteering democratises participation by lowering geographic, mobility and cost barriers. Organisations in the global south — including in India — can tap international technical skills without the expense of international travel or long-term relocation.

3. Legal and contractual status of online volunteers
- Affiliation and responsibility: Online volunteers are considered volunteers of the partner organisation for whom they perform tasks. UNV acts as the platform provider and facilitator rather than as the legal employer.
- Conditions of service: Online volunteers do not receive UNV contracts, do not benefit from UNV-administered financial support such as the Volunteer Living Allowance (VLA), and are not covered by the same employment or service conditions that govern UNV-contracted volunteers. This distinction has concrete implications for liability, benefits, insurance and dispute resolution.
- Practical consequence: Partner organisations retain primary responsibility for task management, verification of outputs, safeguarding and the volunteer’s local legal or regulatory compliance where relevant.

4. Strengths and limitations: operational and programmatic considerations
- Strengths
  - Cost-effectiveness: Remote engagement reduces overheads associated with physical placements.
  - Rapid access to specialised skills: Enables short-term, specialised interventions (e.g., policy drafting, GIS mapping, cybersecurity advice).
  - Scalability and diaspora engagement: Platforms can engage skilled diasporas and global civic professionals in support of national development or institutional reform.
- Limitations
  - Activity boundaries: Tasks requiring physical presence, local accreditation or on-the-ground implementation are not suitable for remote volunteers.
  - Language and cultural barriers: A three-language platform excludes many potential contributors and beneficiaries; localization remains a barrier to maximal inclusion.
  - Verification and quality: Remote contexts complicate supervision, quality assurance and impact verification compared with in-country placements.

5. Quality assurance, risk management and accountability
- Essential controls: Effective use of online volunteers requires clear vetting procedures, explicit terms of engagement, data protection and privacy safeguards, and monitoring and reporting mechanisms tied to project outcomes.
- Partner accountability: Because volunteers are affiliated with partner organisations, those partners must undertake safeguarding, verification of volunteer identity and competencies, and risk mitigation (e.g., protecting sensitive data or national-security-relevant information).
- Policy consequences: The legal status distinction (online volunteer vs. UNV-contracted volunteer) affects insurance, reporting lines, entitlements and liability — all of which are material to both volunteers and partner organisations.

6. Operational impact measurement
- Indicators to track value: Volunteer hours, number and diversity of tasks completed, geographic spread of host organisations, quality of matches (skills to need), downstream project outcomes, and cost savings relative to in-person alternatives.
- Evidence-use: Robust tracking helps justify platform use to funders, informs prioritisation of tasks suitable for remote work, and supports policy decisions about diaspora engagement or remote capacity-building.

7. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic opportunities
  - Capacity augmentation: Indian government agencies and think tanks can leverage online volunteering to supplement scarce technical expertise (e.g., cyber policy, geospatial analysis, strategic communications) without long recruitment cycles.
  - Diaspora mobilization: The global Indian diaspora represents a pool of expertise that can be mobilised digitally to support development and policy research consistent with India’s strategic preferences.
  - Soft power and norms: India’s participation in such platforms can strengthen its image as an engaged global actor supporting multilateralism and capacity-sharing.
- Security and policy risks
  - Information sensitivity: Remote volunteers working on governance, security-sector reform, or critical infrastructure projects raise concerns about data protection, confidentiality and inadvertent transfer of sensitive knowledge.
  - Vetting and counterintelligence: Standard online vetting may be insufficient for tasks touching on national security; additional screening and supervision protocols are necessary.
  - Legal and diplomatic clarity: Reliance on volunteers affiliated to partner organisations (not UNV) implies that Indian agencies must clarify legal responsibilities, liability and recourse in cases of malpractice or security breaches.
- Policy recommendations (concise)
  - Differentiate task types: Reserve online volunteering for non-sensitive, capacity-building and analytic tasks; avoid remote engagement for operations involving classified or critical-infrastructure data.
  - Strengthen partner protocols: Require partner organisations to adhere to stricter vetting, data-protection and safeguarding standards for engagements touching India’s strategic interests.
  - Build domestic platforms and language support: Invest in multilingual, India-centered remote volunteering platforms to better recruit local-language talent and reduce reliance on globally oriented three-language services.
  - Monitor and evaluate: Develop metrics to track the strategic value and any downstream security implications of remote volunteering engagements.

Conclusion  
The UNV Online Volunteering Service is a mature, cost-effective mechanism for connecting global skills to development and governance needs. Its early adoption by UNV signals a forward-looking approach to remote engagement. For India, the service offers tangible opportunities to enhance capacity and mobilise diaspora expertise, but these must be balanced against risks of information sensitivity, imperfect vetting and legal ambiguity. Policymakers should thus adopt calibrated, task-differentiated policies that exploit the strengths of online volunteering while instituting robust safeguards where national-security considerations arise.

### Plan of Action to Integrate Volunteering into the 2030 Agenda

This section examines the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) initiative to mainstream volunteerism within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, tracking the evolution from preparatory engagement before 2015 through the UN-led Plan of Action (2016–2030), and assessing implications for national policy — in particular for states such as India where volunteer mobilisation intersects with strategic culture and national security concerns.

#### From advocacy to institutional strategy (2012–2015)
- Since 2012 UNV made the integration of volunteerism into the post‑2015 development agenda a core priority, moving from advocacy to operational engagement. This shift sought to ensure volunteerism was visible not only as civic practice but also as a means of implementation for development goals.
- In 2014, UNV supported the second round of United Nations Development Group (UNDG) dialogues on implementing the post‑2015 agenda. These dialogues were organized around six thematic streams:
  1. Localizing the agenda
  2. Strengthening capacities and institutions
  3. Participatory monitoring for accountability
  4. Partnerships with civil society
  5. Engaging the private sector
  6. Culture and development
- UNV co‑led the dialogues on partnerships with civil society and played an active role in the dialogues on participatory monitoring for accountability, emphasising how volunteer networks can both hold actors to account and contribute to locally grounded monitoring systems.
- UNV’s Field Units and Post‑2015 International UN Youth Volunteers supported these six themes across multiple countries. Field Units and Youth Volunteers contributed to, and sometimes conducted, local, national and global events and workshops, aimed at ensuring stakeholder voices were included, disseminating good practices and identifying concrete opportunities to embed volunteerism in implementation plans.

#### Global consultation and normative recognition
- A UN‑led consultation process — involving over eight million people — underscored the widespread salience of volunteerism to the development agenda. This mass consultation helped build normative momentum.
- The UN Secretary‑General’s Synthesis Report on the post‑2015 process explicitly identified volunteerism as a powerful, cross‑cutting means of implementation for the SDGs. The report argued that volunteerism can expand and mobilise constituencies, engage people in national planning and implementation, and provide spaces where governments and communities interact to produce concrete, scalable actions that localize the agenda.

#### The Plan of Action (2016–2030): purpose and architecture
- At the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly the Secretary‑General proposed a Plan of Action for 2016–2030 to integrate volunteering into peace and development policies and programmes. The Plan represents a strategic, collective, long‑term approach aligned with the SDG implementation period.
- The Plan is conceived as a UN framework designed to convene a broad coalition of actors: governments, UN entities, volunteer‑involving organizations, the private sector, civil society (including academia), and other stakeholders.
- The Plan’s stated purposes are threefold:
  a) Strengthen people’s ownership of the development agenda, thereby improving legitimacy and sustainability of policies.
  b) Integrate volunteerism into national and global implementation strategies — embedding volunteer mechanisms in policy, planning, and programmes.
  c) Measure volunteerism — develop comparable metrics and evidence to track contributions and inform policy.

#### Advancing the debate: the 2020 technical meeting and the HLPF
- A global technical meeting on volunteering was scheduled as a virtual special event alongside the 2020 High‑level Political Forum (HLPF) in New York. A UN General Assembly resolution set the meeting theme as “Reimagining volunteering for the 2030 Agenda” and requested UNV to organize the meeting jointly with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).
- The 2020 context — notably the COVID‑19 pandemic — both influenced the meeting’s virtual format and highlighted volunteers’ central roles in health response, social support and community resilience.
- The meeting’s goal was to advance international debate on volunteering and identify how volunteerism can accelerate the achievement of the SDGs.

#### Measuring and institutionalising volunteerism
- Effective integration requires robust measurement. Typical metrics include volunteer participation rates, hours contributed, economic valuation of unpaid work, demographic breakdowns (gender, age, location), and policy presence (existence of national volunteer strategies or legal recognition).
- Integrating volunteerism into policy also requires: national strategies that articulate roles for volunteers; legal recognition and protection frameworks; sustainable funding mechanisms; capacity building for volunteer management; and data systems to monitor impact and protect volunteers’ rights.

#### Implementation challenges
- Coordination across multiple stakeholders (government ministries, security institutions, UN agencies, INGOs, community groups) is complex and resource‑intensive.
- Ensuring quality and protection of volunteers — safeguarding, liability, insurance, psychosocial support — is a persistent challenge.
- Sustainable financing is often fragmented; volunteerism is frequently seen as cost‑free, obscuring the need for investment in training, coordination and infrastructure.
- Standardising data collection and producing comparable metrics remains difficult, limiting evidence‑based policymaking.

#### Potential benefits and strategic relevance for India
- Benefits of integrating volunteering into national development and security policy include increased local ownership, scalable grassroots solutions, enhanced civic engagement, and stronger civil society–state linkages.
- For India — where volunteerism is embedded in a rich civic tradition and where non‑state mobilisations play important roles in disaster response, public health outreach, and social cohesion — formalising volunteer contributions can strengthen resilience and complement state capacity.
- Specific strategic implications:
  - Disaster and humanitarian response: volunteer networks can provide rapid local mobilisation and situational knowledge that enhance military and civilian relief operations.
  - Public health and pandemic response: volunteers extend outreach and community trust, critical for vaccination drives and behaviour change campaigns.
  - Subnational governance and border areas: volunteerism can create channels of local legitimacy in areas where state presence is thin, reducing grievances and contributing to stability.
  - Civil‑military relations: clearly defined roles for volunteers reduce confusion in joint operations and protect both volunteers and security personnel.
  - Soft power and external engagement: India’s volunteer diaspora and international volunteering programmes can augment development diplomacy and cultural outreach.

#### Policy recommendations (concise)
- Institutionalise volunteerism in national security and development planning: include volunteer roles in contingency plans, civil–military cooperation protocols and district‑level resilience strategies.
- Develop a national volunteer strategy with legal recognition, protection provisions, and funding lines for coordination and training.
- Invest in data systems to measure volunteer contributions (hours, scope, demographic reach) and include volunteer indicators in SDG monitoring frameworks.
- Strengthen partnerships between government, academia, private sector and volunteer organisations to professionalise volunteer management and create clear accountability mechanisms.
- Ensure protections and quality standards for volunteers (safeguarding, insurance, training), particularly where volunteers operate in high‑risk or security‑sensitive environments.

Conclusion
The UNV Plan of Action reframes volunteerism from a peripheral civic activity to an instrument of implementation for the 2030 Agenda. For states like India, aligning volunteer mobilisation with strategic culture and national security policy offers practical gains — enhanced local ownership, resilience and civil–state synergy — but requires deliberate policy design, measurement, protections and financing to realise those gains at scale.

## Volunteer Action Counts: UNV’s 2012 Campaign and Its Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security

Background and launch
- In 2012 the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme launched the "Volunteer Action Counts" campaign to document and publicize the global impact of volunteer activities. The initiative was timed to coincide with the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20, Rio de Janeiro, 2012), creating a deliberate link between grassroots civic engagement and global sustainability policy.
- By Rio+20 UNV reported that more than 64 million volunteer “actions” had been counted. That figure was presented as evidence of widespread, bottom‑up commitment to sustainable development and used to bolster advocacy for greater recognition of volunteering in national and international policy fora.
- UN Secretary‑General Ban Ki‑moon referenced the campaign at the 2012 UN General Assembly and framed Rio+20 as mobilizing a global movement for change, explicitly linking the Summit’s sustainability goals to volunteer action. His endorsement provided political visibility and legitimacy to volunteer advocacy.

Understanding the 64 million figure: meaning and limits
- The headline number—64 million volunteer “actions”—signals large‑scale participation and is rhetorically powerful. However, for academic and policy use the term “action” requires unpacking:
  - What constitutes a discrete “action”? (e.g., a single event, a day of service, an ongoing assignment)
  - How were actions reported, aggregated and verified across contexts?
  - To what extent do counts capture intensity, duration or impact of engagement?
- Without clarity on methodology the figure is vulnerable to critique and of limited use for rigorous policy design. For national security and development planning, raw counts must be mapped to outcomes rather than treated as self‑evident indicators of capability or resilience.

Digital channels, online volunteering and sustained narrative building
- UNV’s Online Volunteering service (a matching platform for remote assignments) and its newsletter were highlighted by the campaign as mechanisms to surface internet‑based volunteering experiences, best practices and lessons learned from organizations and volunteers worldwide.
- The Volunteer Action Counts website and social media channels continue to collect volunteering stories, announce events and circulate guidance, maintaining visibility for volunteer narratives beyond the Rio+20 moment.
- Sustained web and social‑media presence matters for mobilizing volunteers, documenting innovations (including remote/cyber volunteering) and for keeping volunteer contributions visible to policymakers and the public.

Institutionalization: International Volunteer Day and advocacy
- UNV marks International Volunteer Day (5 December) each year; this annual observance functions as a regular advocacy milestone to recognize volunteer efforts and to push for policy commitments at national and subnational levels.
- High‑level endorsements (e.g., from the UN Secretary‑General) combined with recurrent calendar moments increase opportunities to translate advocacy into formal recognition, resources and supportive legal frameworks.

Governance considerations: measurement, inclusivity and sustainability
- Key governance challenges raised by the campaign include:
  - Measurement standards and verification: the need for clear, transparent methodologies so counts can be independently audited and used in policy evaluation.
  - Inclusion and diversity: capturing who volunteers (age, gender, location, sector) to ensure equitable representation and to target outreach where gaps exist.
  - Long‑term sustainability of platforms: digital platforms are effective in mobilizing and matching volunteers but require resources, data governance safeguards and continuity plans.
- Linking volunteer data to broader frameworks—most notably the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—can increase policy relevance and help track contributions to specific development outcomes.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Volunteerism as social capital and resilience:
  - Large‑scale volunteer engagement contributes to societal resilience—critical in a country like India that faces frequent natural disasters, public‑health emergencies and complex development challenges. Volunteer networks can complement state capacity in disaster response, recovery and community policing of public goods.
  - The normative prominence of volunteerism can shape strategic culture by reinforcing civic responsibility, pluralistic mobilization and non‑state modalities of national service—all factors that influence how India conceives its social cohesion and internal security.
- Civil‑military and civil‑society complementarities:
  - Institutionalized volunteer platforms facilitate coordination between government agencies (including security services in humanitarian assistance) and civil society, thereby improving civil‑military cooperation during crises without militarizing civilian relief.
- Cyber and diaspora dimensions:
  - Online volunteering platforms expand India’s capacity to harness technical and advisory skills from its large diaspora and domestic IT workforce, strengthening capabilities in cyber resilience, remote education, public‑information campaigns and open‑source disaster mapping—areas increasingly relevant to national security.
- Soft power and normative projection:
  - Documented, well‑organized volunteer efforts support India’s soft power and international development diplomacy by showcasing domestic models of community engagement that can be adapted in South Asia and beyond.

Policy recommendations (for Indian policymakers and civil society)
- Clarify and publish counting methodology: If India uses or cites volunteer metrics (its own or international), it should insist on transparent methodologies—definitions of an “action,” verification procedures, and methods to avoid double‑counting—so data can inform planning and evaluation.
- Map volunteer contributions to SDGs and national security outcomes: Integrate volunteer data into SDG indicators and into national disaster‑response, public‑health and community resilience metrics to demonstrate measurable links between volunteering and policy goals.
- Invest in digital volunteering platforms: Support and resource online matching services (including partnerships with UNV’s Online Volunteering) to leverage remote skills, engage the diaspora and scale expert volunteer contributions to public‑policy problems.
- Use International Volunteer Day and high‑level endorsements to secure formal recognition: Employ annual observances and endorsements from national leaders to promote legal recognition, fiscal incentives or institutional support for volunteerism (for example, certification, training and service credits that integrate with national emergency response systems).
- Collect disaggregated data: Mandate collection of volunteer data disaggregated by age, gender, location, socio‑economic status and sector to assess equity, direct outreach and evaluate strategic impacts across India’s diverse regions.
- Ensure platform governance and sustainability: Develop standards for data protection, continuity funding, and public‑private governance of digital volunteer platforms to preserve trust and operational effectiveness.

Conclusion
The UNV “Volunteer Action Counts” campaign succeeded as an advocacy device—providing political visibility to volunteerism at Rio+20 and beyond—but its utility for rigorous policy and security analysis depends on methodological transparency and integration with outcome frameworks. For India, thoughtfully institutionalizing volunteer data, investing in digital platforms, and linking grassroots action to national resilience and SDG implementation can convert volunteer energy into a calibrated asset for strategic culture and national security policy.

## 5.X The United Nations Volunteers’ State of the World’s Volunteerism Report (SWVR): Themes, Findings and Implications for National Security Policy

Volunteerism—organized and informal acts of public-spirited service—has emerged in UN discourse as a measurable, policy-relevant force shaping social cohesion, disaster response and civic governance. The United Nations Volunteers (UNV) programme’s State of the World’s Volunteerism Report (SWVR) is the flagship triennial assessment of that force. For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the SWVR series offers empirical evidence and normative guidance on how volunteering contributes to resilience, governance and social inclusion—factors increasingly recognized as components of comprehensive national security.

This section summarizes the SWVR series (2011, 2015, 2018, 2022), highlights its principal findings and methodological approach, and draws targeted implications for Indian policy-makers seeking to integrate volunteerism into a broader strategy for stability, resilience and inclusive governance.

1. Overview of the SWVR series
- Produced by: United Nations Volunteers (UNV).
- Frequency: Triennial flagship publication documenting volunteerism’s scope, roles and policy implications.
- Purpose: To strengthen understanding of volunteerism’s universality, scope and reach in the twenty‑first century and to offer evidence-based policy guidance for states, development actors and civil society.

2. Editions, launch dates and thematic focus
- 2011 (Launched 5 December 2011, UN General Assembly, New York; dissemination in ~80 countries)
  - First edition; established baseline conceptualisation of volunteerism in development practice.
  - Thematic emphasis: contributions to sustainable livelihoods, social inclusion, social cohesion and disaster risk reduction.
- 2015 (Launched June 2015)
  - Title/Focus: Transforming Governance.
  - Emphasised how volunteer voices and civic action strengthen governance at local, national and global levels. Relied on country evidence from Brazil, Kenya, Lebanon, Bangladesh and others.
- 2018 (Launched 18 July 2018, High-Level Political Forum, New York)
  - Title/Focus: “The thread that binds: Volunteerism and community resilience.”
  - Central claim: volunteerism is integral to community resilience and collective responses to economic, social and environmental challenges.
- 2022 (Published as 2022 edition; launched December 2021)
  - Title/Focus: Building Equal and Inclusive Societies.
  - Found that volunteerism fosters collaborative relations, helps rebalance power between citizens and state, and expands civic participation.

3. Main findings by edition (summary)
- 2011
  - Volunteerism supports sustainable livelihoods, promotes social inclusion and cohesion, and strengthens disaster risk reduction capacities.
  - Positioned volunteering as an alternative, community-rooted pathway to social betterment and policy engagement.
- 2015
  - Volunteer actors and networks can influence governance outcomes and service delivery.
  - Case studies showed grassroots volunteering improves transparency, accountability and citizen‑state communication—conditions linked to successful SDG implementation.
- 2018
  - Volunteerism underpins community resilience by enabling collective problem‑solving across economic, social and environmental domains.
  - Caution: without support, volunteering can be exclusionary or create burdens for vulnerable populations.
  - Recommended targeted support from states and development agencies to amplify benefits and mitigate risks.
- 2022
  - Volunteerism contributes to more equal and inclusive societies by promoting collaborative decision‑making and diversifying channels of civic participation.
  - It can shift or rebalance power relations between citizens and authorities when institutionalised appropriately.

4. Methodology, audience and evidence base
- Produced for: policy‑makers, UN agencies, civil society, volunteer organisations and researchers.
- Evidence: mixed methods—country case studies, qualitative analyses, sectoral examples and thematic synthesis.
- Orientation: frequent linkage of volunteerism to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), mapping practical policy implications for integrating volunteering into development programming.

5. Cross‑cutting policy messages and recommended actions
- Enabling environment: create legal, institutional and fiscal frameworks that recognise and protect volunteers (legal status, insurance, safety protocols).
- Capacity building: invest in training, infrastructure and logistics that allow volunteers to operate effectively, especially in disaster response and public service augmentation.
- Recognition and support: formal recognition (accreditation, certification), sustainable funding streams and social protection measures to avoid exploitation.
- Equity and inclusion: monitor who volunteers and who bears unpaid burdens; adopt measures that prevent marginalisation of women, low‑income groups and other vulnerable populations.
- Integration into policy: mainstream volunteering into national development and disaster management strategies; measure contributions to SDGs and resilience metrics.

6. Risks and benefits (recurrent themes)
- Benefits: generates social capital, strengthens social cohesion, enhances disaster response capacity, enables civic participation and augments governance.
- Risks: potential for unpaid exploitation, reinforcement of gendered/unpaid care burdens, exclusionary practices and tokenistic engagement if not institutionally supported.

7. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
The SWVR’s findings are directly relevant to India’s conception of security as multidimensional—encompassing human, societal and ecological resilience alongside traditional defense concerns. Key implications:

- Social cohesion as a security asset
  - Volunteerism builds social capital and inter‑community trust—critical buffers against communal tensions and radicalisation. India’s diversified civil society networks and tradition of community self‑help (e.g., informal mutual aid during crises) can be harnessed to strengthen societal resilience in sensitive regions.
- Disaster resilience and rapid response
  - India faces recurrent natural disasters and pandemic shocks. Formalising the role of volunteer networks (training, accreditation, logistics and legal protections) will improve surge capacity without substituting for state responsibility.
- Governance and legitimacy
  - Volunteer-led accountability and service delivery can augment state legitimacy, particularly at the local level. Integrating volunteer channels into participatory governance mechanisms (panchayats, urban local bodies) can deepen democratic engagement and help monitor implementation of public goods.
- Equity, inclusion and the gender dimension
  - Policymakers must avoid offloading care and recovery responsibilities onto already burdened women and marginalized groups. Policies should include stipends, insurance and recognition to prevent exploitation and foster inclusive participation.
- Strategic communications and countering misinformation
  - Volunteer networks can be mobilised for public information campaigns—important for crisis communication and countering disinformation that threatens societal stability.
- Institutional recommendations for India
  - Legislate a clear enabling framework that recognises volunteer status, entitlements and protections.
  - Establish accreditation and training standards tied to disaster management and public service complementarities.
  - Create funding windows and tax incentives for organised volunteer groups while protecting independence of civil society.
  - Integrate volunteer metrics into national resilience and SDG monitoring systems.
  - Ensure participatory design of volunteer policies to preserve grassroots autonomy and prevent co‑optation.

Conclusion
The SWVR series provides a consistent empirical and normative case that volunteerism is a strategic public good: it enhances resilience, governance and inclusion while posing identifiable risks if unsupported. For India—whose security calculus must balance military preparedness with robust social resilience—systematic integration of volunteerism into national security and development policy can yield durable dividends in cohesion, crisis response and democratic legitimacy. Policymakers should therefore approach volunteering not as ad hoc charity but as an institutionalised element of a comprehensive security architecture.
