### The Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA): origins, purpose and relevance to India

Note on source reliability
- The core text under review reproduces a Wikipedia-style maintenance template (a call for additional citations). This signals potential reliability issues and means the factual claims below should be treated as provisional until checked against primary and reputable secondary sources.

Overview and nature
- CICA is an inter‑governmental forum of Asian states established to promote peace, security and stability across the continent. As an inter‑governmental body it is composed of member states (governments) that meet to discuss common concerns; it is primarily a dialogue and cooperation platform rather than a collective defence pact with binding enforcement mechanisms.

Founding moment and timeline (verify)
- The idea for CICA is widely attributed to Kazakhstan’s President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who reportedly proposed convening such a forum on 5 October 1992 in remarks to the UN General Assembly. The literature notes a 25th‑anniversary commemoration on 5 October 2017; both the founding claim and anniversary should be verified against UN General Assembly records and official CICA documents.

Purpose and foundational premises
- Primary purpose: to enhance cooperation through confidence‑building measures (CBMs) that reduce misperception and the risk of conflict, thereby promoting regional peace, security and stability.
- Foundational premise: regional security in Asia is closely linked to global security. CICA’s conceptual framing emphasizes that instability in Asia reverberates globally, justifying pan‑continental cooperation.
- Core normative principles stated in CICA discourse include:
  - Indivisibility of security: the security of one state is connected to that of others; unilateral or zero‑sum approaches are therefore counterproductive.
  - Joint initiative: collective, collaborative action by states to prevent and manage conflicts.
  - Mutually beneficial interaction between small and large states: an explicit attempt to make the forum relevant and equitable across differences in size and power.

Confidence‑building measures: concept and examples
- CBMs seek to increase transparency, reduce misperception, and lower the risk of inadvertent escalation. Typical measures (and those relevant to CICA’s remit) include:
  - Military transparency measures: notifications of troop movements, advance notice of large exercises.
  - Information sharing: regular exchange of security‑relevant data and threat assessments.
  - Communication mechanisms: hotlines, crisis communication protocols between capitals or militaries.
  - Joint activities: joint exercises with limited scope, search‑and‑rescue drills, anti‑terrorism cooperation, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) exercises.
  - Confidence‑building workshops, academic exchanges, and people‑to‑people dialogues.

Institutional architecture and operational features (verification needed)
- CICA’s work tends to be dialogue‑driven, relying on consensus‑based decision making and working groups rather than binding commitments. Important elements to verify when describing the institution:
  - Membership and observer lists with accession dates.
  - Existence and role of permanent structures (a secretariat or institutional headquarters), rotating chairmanship arrangements, and the formal status of ministerial summits or heads‑of‑state meetings.
  - The existence and outputs of working groups or task forces on issues such as counterterrorism, economic cooperation and HADR.
- In practice CICA is more likely to produce declarations, action plans and non‑binding CBMs than enforceable security guarantees.

Comparative placement within Asia’s security architecture
- CICA sits alongside other regional security mechanisms that vary in scope and membership:
  - ASEAN and its mechanisms (ARF, EAS) operate in Southeast Asia with institutionalized processes and an emphasis on normative consensus.
  - The Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) combines security cooperation with politico‑economic integration among a narrower set of Eurasian powers.
  - Bilateral regimes (e.g., India–China, India–Pakistan talks) and subregional arrangements also play major roles.
- CICA’s comparative niche: a pan‑Asian platform oriented specifically toward CBMs across a wide geographic and political spectrum, rather than the narrower, more institutionalized or security‑integrationist agendas of others.

Operational considerations and limitations
- Strengths:
  - Potential to foster broad, inclusive dialogue across diverse Asian states.
  - A forum for standardizing and diffusing low‑cost, confidence‑building practices across the region.
- Limitations:
  - Heterogeneous membership with divergent security interests constrains ambitious collective action.
  - Consensus decision‑making and lack of enforcement capacity limit the translation of declarations into practice.
  - Variable institutional capacity: if there is no strong secretariat or permanent apparatus, follow‑through on initiatives may be weak.
  - Political rivalries among major powers can stall agenda‑setting and implementation.
- Net effect: CICA’s effectiveness depends heavily on member political will, incremental implementation of CBMs, and complementarity with other regional mechanisms.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Fit with India’s multilateral preferences: CICA resonates with India’s traditional emphasis on multilateral dialogue, non‑alignment (and now strategic autonomy), and preference for confidence‑building over formal bloc alignments.
- India’s potential engagement priorities:
  - Use CICA as a venue to push for transparency measures (military notifications, communications protocols) that reduce misperception in South and Central Asia.
  - Leverage CICA for HADR cooperation, counterterrorism exchanges and capacity‑building that align with India’s neighbourhood policy.
  - Guard against any institutional arrangements that might constrain India’s strategic autonomy or be dominated by rival power blocs.
- Cautions for Indian policymakers:
  - Given CICA’s inclusive membership, India must weigh benefits of participation against the possibility that commitments made in multilateral fora remain declaratory and produce limited operational returns.

Recommended verification and sources for scholarly work
- Primary sources:
  - UN General Assembly records — speech by N. Nazarbayev (5 Oct 1992): to confirm the founding proposal.
  - Official CICA website and archived summit communiqués: membership, institutional arrangements, and formal outcomes.
- Secondary and analytical sources:
  - Peer‑reviewed articles and books on Asian security architectures (journals such as International Security, Asian Survey, Contemporary Security Policy).
  - Think‑tank reports and briefings from IISS, Carnegie Endowment, SIPRI, and regional research institutes.
  - Country studies or working papers that examine India’s multilateral security engagements.
- Databases: JSTOR, ProQuest, and official government releases (Ministry of External Affairs, India; ministries in other member states).

Suggested follow‑up additions if expanding this chapter
- A verified, dated list of CICA member and observer states with accession dates.
- A concise timeline of major CICA meetings/summits and key outcomes.
- A mapped description of institutional organs (chairmanship, working groups, secretariat) with source citations.
- Case studies of specific CBMs adopted under CICA and assessments of their implementation.
- Comparative analysis with ASEAN Regional Forum and the SCO to situate CICA’s practical value for Indian policy.

Concluding evaluative remark
- CICA represents an ambitious attempt to translate the principle of indivisible regional security into practical cooperation across a pluralistic Asia. For India, CICA is potentially useful as a low‑cost, normative forum to promote transparency, HADR and counterterrorism cooperation — but its ultimate value depends on whether member states convert dialogic commitments into verifiable, sustained practice. Verification of institutional facts and careful comparative analysis are essential before assigning CICA a central role in India’s security architecture.

### The Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA): Origins, Institutionalization and Relevance for India

Introduction — why CICA matters for Indian strategic culture
- CICA was conceived as a pan‑Asian forum to promote dialogue and confidence‑building across a highly heterogeneous and strategically contested continent. For India — whose strategic culture prizes strategic autonomy, multilateral engagement on its own terms, and pragmatic incrementalism — CICA offers both an opportunity and a set of constraints: a vehicle for pan‑continental interaction that sits comfortably with India’s preference for non‑binding, consensus‑based diplomacy, yet one whose effectiveness is limited by the diversity of membership and weak enforcement mechanisms. The following section traces CICA’s institutional development, summarizes its normative and procedural instruments, examines thematic evolution (notably the post‑9/11 turn to counter‑terrorism), and assesses implications for India’s national security policy.

1. Origins and formative years (proposal to first ministerial and summit)
- The idea for CICA was received positively by several Asian capitals; over roughly seven years this initial proposal generated a sequence of intergovernmental meetings to settle modalities and draft foundational texts.
- First Ministers of Foreign Affairs meeting (14 September 1999): 15 member states participated and adopted the Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between CICA Member States — a normative baseline expressing commitments to non‑use of force, peaceful dispute settlement, respect for sovereignty and similar confidence‑building principles.
- First CICA Summit (4 June 2002): attended by 16 Member States, this summit adopted the Almaty Act — the de facto charter that gives CICA a formal legal‑political identity and frames its purpose: cooperation and confidence‑building across political, security, economic and humanitarian dimensions in Asia.

2. The catalytic role of 9/11 and the rise of counter‑terrorism on the CICA agenda
- The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 were an external shock that reoriented many multilateral forums; for CICA, the 2002 summit crystallized counter‑terrorism as a central priority.
- Thereafter counter‑terrorism became a recurrent substantive theme in ministerial and summit deliberations, reflecting both transnational threat perceptions and a willingness among members to cooperate on law‑enforcement, intelligence‑sharing and capacity building — even if practical cooperation remained uneven.

3. Consolidation of instruments and procedures (2004–2010)
- 2004 Second Ministers of Foreign Affairs meeting: adoption of the CICA Catalogue of Confidence‑Building Measures (CBMs). This Catalogue supplies practical mechanisms — generally non‑binding — aimed at reducing misperceptions and enhancing transparency. Typical CBMs include military transparency measures, information exchange, border cooperation, joint disaster relief exercises and exchanges on counter‑terrorism measures.
- 2004: adoption of CICA Rules of Procedure, providing procedural and operational guidance, an important step from ad hoc gatherings toward predictable institutional practice.
- 2006 Second Summit: admission of Thailand and the Republic of Korea as members and the decision to establish a permanent secretariat — a decisive move toward bureaucratic continuity and institutionalization.
- 2008 Third Ministers’ meeting: admission of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates.
- 2010 Third Summit: Turkey assumed the Chairmanship from founding Chairman Kazakhstan; Iraq and Vietnam were admitted; and the CICA Convention was adopted, intended to further codify member commitments and procedures. The Convention’s legal force, however, depends on each member’s accession and domestic ratification.

4. Membership enlargement and institutional diffusion (2011–2022)
- CICA expanded in stages after 2010: Bahrain and Cambodia (2011); Bangladesh and Qatar (2014); Sri Lanka (2018); Kuwait (2022). Gradual enlargement indicates growing regional buy‑in but also increases the heterogeneity of political interests and threat perceptions within the organization.

5. Key instruments and institutional features — what they do and what they mean
- Almaty Act: functions as the charter, anchoring political identity and core principles across members.
- Catalogue of Confidence‑Building Measures: an operational toolkit for CBMs; largely non‑binding but important for norm‑building and day‑to‑day cooperation.
- Rules of Procedure and permanent secretariat: move CICA from episodic summits toward routinized diplomacy. The secretariat provides continuity, institutional memory and administrative capacity, albeit dependent on host resourcing and political support.
- CICA Convention (2010): an attempt to formalize obligations; its practical effects hinge on signatures, ratifications, and domestic implementation.
- Chairmanship rotation: symbolic of shared stewardship and a mechanism for agenda‑setting; the Chair’s priorities often shape short‑term activity.

6. Strengths, limits and the practical politics of implementation
- Strengths: CICA’s pan‑Asian composition offers a unique convening power across Central, East, South, Southeast and West Asia; its preference for CBMs and non‑binding instruments aligns with the diplomatic cultures of many members, making it a useful platform for confidence‑building where bilateral relations are constrained.
- Limits: the organization’s consensus orientation and diverse membership complicate negotiated outcomes; commitments are often declaratory with limited enforcement; geopolitical rivalries among members can blunt collective action; and the real capacity for implementation depends on national follow‑through and resources entrusted to the secretariat.
- External shocks matter: the 9/11 example shows how shared threat perceptions can accelerate cooperation, but sustaining momentum requires translating declarations into operational programs.

7. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic fit: CICA aligns with India’s proclivity for multilateralism that preserves autonomy. India can use CICA to advance norms (e.g., non‑use of force), deepen issue‑specific cooperation (disaster relief, counter‑terrorism, border management), and engage a broad set of Asian states in a low‑risk multilateral context.
- Operational utility: practical CBMs — military transparency measures, joint exercises in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), and information exchange on terrorism — are congruent with India’s focus on confidence‑building along its borders and in regional security fora.
- Constraints for Indian policy: the platform’s diversity makes decisive collective action difficult; intelligence‑sensitive cooperation may be limited by members’ varying legal standards and political trust; India must balance engagements within CICA against its bilateral priorities and its roles in other institutions (e.g., Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, Quad, BRICS).
- Policy recommendations (concise): engage selectively and pragmatically; prioritize implementable, small‑scale CBMs that build trust (HADR, border management protocols, judicial cooperation against terrorism); use chairmanship periods or working groups to push for measurable follow‑through; insist on clear reporting and capacity support for the secretariat to enhance implementation.

8. Conclusions and caveats for assessment
- CICA illustrates a transition from an idea to an institutionalized regional forum over roughly a decade: adoption of founding texts, a catalogue of CBMs, procedural rules, a permanent secretariat and a convention are markers of that evolution.
- Counter‑terrorism has been a catalytic substantive focus since 2002, complementing traditional CBMs and reflecting Asia’s shared security concerns.
- Institutional developments have improved continuity and legitimacy, but practical impact remains conditioned by the political will of members, their willingness to implement non‑binding measures, and the capacity of the secretariat.
- For ongoing analysis: verify current membership, the status of ratification/accession to the 2010 Convention, the present Chairmanship, and the operational capacity and location of the secretariat — these factors determine CICA’s present relevance to Indian strategic objectives.

This concise institutional history and assessment highlights why India should regard CICA as a useful, though limited, instrument within a broader toolkit of multilateral engagement — effective for confidence‑building and norm development when leveraged selectively, but unlikely to substitute for bilateral diplomacy or stronger regional security mechanisms where enforcement and decisive action are required.

## Membership of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA)

CICA is a deliberately transregional multilateral forum whose membership and associated partners embody its ambition to be an “Asia‑plus” platform for confidence‑building measures (CBMs). Understanding CICA’s composition — who participates, in what capacity, and with what agendas — is essential for assessing its utility as a vehicle for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. The membership list, observer roles, and partner organizations both structure the forum’s capacity and reveal the political constraints that shape its outputs.

### Composition at a glance
- Total membership: 28 states
- Observers: 10 states
- Observer organizations: 5
- Partner organizations: 6

This multi‑tiered participation model (members, observers, observer organizations, partners) reflects CICA’s dual purpose: to build inclusive dialogue across very different polities while allowing specialized organizations to supply technical expertise.

### Members (selected and grouped for analytic clarity)
CICA members span the length and breadth of Eurasia. The list includes governments from Central, South, East, Southeast and West Asia, plus transregional powers:

- Central Asia: Kazakhstan (host and central organizing state), Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan
- South Asia: India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan
- West/Levant/Gulf: Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Palestine, Turkey, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Yemen is not a member; notable Gulf states present
- East & Southeast Asia: China, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam
- Transregional / extra‑regional participants: Russia, Egypt

(For completeness the membership also includes Azerbaijan and others listed above; the precise membership list should be consulted in official CICA records.)

The mix is intentionally heterogeneous: major powers (China, Russia, India), regional middle powers (Turkey, Iran, Pakistan), smaller Gulf monarchies (Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE), Southeast Asian states (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam), and a disputed entity (Palestine) are all represented. Kazakhstan’s role as founder and host gives the forum a Central Asian anchor and a neutral convening power.

### Observers, observer organizations and partners
Observers include major global and regional actors that prefer engagement without full membership: notably the United States, Japan, Indonesia and several ASEAN states, along with Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Belarus, Ukraine and Laos. Observer organizations and partners bring technical competence or regional linkages:

- Observer organizations: United Nations, Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE), League of Arab States, International Organization for Migration (IOM), Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic Speaking Countries.
- Partner organizations: Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and its Regional Anti‑Terrorist Structure (RATS), Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO), Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Assembly of People of Kazakhstan.

These institutional links signal CICA’s functional priorities (terrorism, migration, transnational crime, economic connectivity) and create avenues for operational cooperation while also introducing potential overlap with other regional bodies.

### Geographic and political diversity: opportunity and constraint
CICA’s breadth is a strategic asset — it brings together states from multiple subregions and different governance types (democracies, monarchies, authoritarian regimes, post‑conflict states). For India, this diversity yields both opportunity and constraint:

- Opportunity: India can situate its regional security concerns (terrorism, cross‑border crime, maritime security, migration) within a wider Eurasian framework, building coalitions beyond South Asia. Inclusion of observers such as the United States and Japan — even at observer level — offers diplomatic leverage and linkage to broader power networks.
- Constraint: Consensus building is difficult. Divergent threat perceptions (e.g., China’s strategic priorities versus Gulf states’ maritime and energy concerns), competing bilateral disputes (notably India–Pakistan, Israel–Palestine), and differing domestic political systems complicate agenda‑setting and implementation.

### Conflict representation and the India–Pakistan dynamic
CICA deliberately includes rival or contested pairs (India–Pakistan; Israel–Palestine), which turns the forum into a potential venue for modest CBMs. For India’s strategic culture — which values sovereign independence and calibrated multilateral engagement — this raises several considerations:

- The presence of Pakistan as a full member ensures that India cannot use CICA for unilateral diplomatic advantage; any India‑led initiative must be defensible to rival scrutiny.
- CICA’s emphasis on incremental confidence‑building (practical cooperation, information sharing, disaster relief, counter‑terrorism capacity building) aligns with India’s preference for technical, non‑politicized multilateralism that avoids zero‑sum prestige contests.
- Participation alongside Israel and Palestine indicates the forum’s political inclusivity and creates space to manage localized tensions through technical cooperation rather than political bargaining.

### Major powers and agenda setting
China and Russia are full members and will, by virtue of power and proximity, heavily shape CICA’s agendas; the United States and Japan are observers whose presence cannot be ignored. For India:

- China’s role influences the framing of security (state‑centric vs. cooperative), economic connectivity, and any maritime/security agenda where Chinese interests intersect with India’s (e.g., South China Sea indirectly, Belt and Road interactions in Central/South Asia).
- Russia’s Eurasian posture dovetails with Central Asian priorities — an area where India seeks to enhance connectivity and counterbalancing ties.
- The U.S. and Japan as observers provide indirect strategic balancing opportunities and can act as bridges for India to connect CICA initiatives to broader Indo‑Pacific frameworks.

### Overlap with other organizations: coordination and duplication
CICA overlaps with several regional architectures (SCO, ECO, EAEU, OSCE) and with UN agencies specializing in migration, crime, and development. This creates both potential synergy and duplication:

- Synergy: Partnering with RATS (SCO) and UNODC/IOM can operationalize CBMs (joint training, counter‑terrorism capacity building, anti‑trafficking programs) and allow CICA to remain practice‑oriented.
- Duplication/Fragmentation: Multiple fora addressing similar issues may dissipate political will and resources; clear niche‑definition (CBMs and technical cooperation as CICA’s comparative advantage) is necessary.

### Functional priorities implied by membership and partners
The composition and partners suggest realistic working priorities for CICA that align with India’s security and strategic culture:

- Counter‑terrorism and information exchange (leveraging RATS, SCO cooperation)
- Migration and displacement (IOM involvement)
- Transnational organized crime, drugs and trafficking (UNODC partnership)
- Disaster risk reduction and humanitarian response (practical CBMs)
- Border and confidence‑building measures — technical protocols, joint training, and transparency mechanisms

These are areas where politically sensitive issues (sovereignty, territorial disputes) can be sidestepped in favor of concrete cooperation.

### Operational challenges
CICA faces several operational constraints that affect its usefulness to Indian policy:

- Heterogeneous threat perceptions and priorities limit consensus and slow decision‑making.
- Overlapping memberships and institutional jurisdictions can create coordination problems.
- Contentious bilateral disputes among members reduce the political space for ambitious agreements.
- Some notable absences (e.g., North Korea, Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives) indicate limits to the forum’s reach.

Consequently, CICA is best suited to small‑scale, technical, confidence‑building projects rather than high politics or comprehensive security architecture.

### Strategic recommendations (for India and like‑minded states)
To maximize CICA’s utility while respecting its constraints, the following strategic approach is recommended:

- Prioritize pragmatic, technical CBMs: disaster response exercises, counter‑terrorism training, anti‑trafficking operations, and rule‑of‑law initiatives that produce tangible benefits and trust.
- Leverage partner expertise: coordinate projects with RATS, UNODC, IOM and SCO/ECO to tap operational capacity while avoiding duplication.
- Use observer states as diplomatic bridges: engage U.S. and Japanese observers to align CICA activity with wider Indo‑Pacific priorities where appropriate.
- Promote small, issue‑based working groups: thematic clusters (counter‑terrorism, migration, disaster relief) can produce incremental deliverables and bypass paralysis on political disputes.
- Employ neutral chairs and Kazakhstan’s convening role: rely on Kazakhstan’s neutral stewardship to manage contentious agenda items and mediate procedural disputes.
- Link CICA outputs to bilateral and subregional initiatives: use multilateral results as supplements to India’s bilateral diplomacy with neighbours and Central Asian partners.

### Diplomatic recommendations (procedural)
- Emphasize transparency and confidence‑building through regular reporting and shared exercises.
- Encourage cross‑membership projects with SCO and ECO to create economies of scale and policy coherence.
- Advocate for clearly defined mandates for partner organizations to minimize turf competition.

### Conclusion
CICA’s membership — expansive, politically diverse, and technically capacious — makes it an important, if modest, instrument for confidence‑building across Eurasia. For India, CICA offers a forum consistent with its strategic culture: a preference for practical, incremental cooperation that preserves sovereignty while enabling multilateral engagement. The forum’s success, however, will depend on disciplined prioritization (technical CBMs), skilful diplomatic management of rivalries (India–Pakistan; Israel–Palestine), and institutional coordination with existing regional bodies. If approached pragmatically, CICA can be a complementary mechanism in India’s broader toolkit for regional stability and national security.

### Chairmanship

The chairmanship of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) is an understudied but strategically important institutional element. Chairs carry practical responsibilities (hosting, agenda‑setting, coordinating meetings, and representing CICA externally) and symbolic weight: who chairs the forum influences which issues receive priority, shapes procedural practice, and signals informal balances of influence among member states. The following concise account situates the recent sequence of CICA chairs, interprets salient patterns and deviations, and draws out implications for member states — with a particular eye to India’s strategic calculations.

Chronology and analytical notes
- Kazakhstan (2002–2010) — duration: 8 years  
  Kazakhstan’s unusually long initial chairmanship coincides with CICA’s formative phase. An extended term provided continuity during institutional consolidation and likely allowed Kazakhstan to imprint procedural norms and agenda priorities. This early leadership role helps explain Kazakhstan’s recurring prominence in CICA affairs.

- Turkey (2010–2014) — duration: 4 years  
  Turkey’s chairing brought a transcontinental actor with strong Euro‑Asian linkages to the fore. Its term likely emphasized connectivity and the Europe‑Asia interface, seeking to project Turkey as a bridge between European security thinking and Asian confidence‑building agendas.

- China (2014–2018) — duration: 4 years  
  A major regional power occupying the chair has clear geopolitical significance. China’s term created an opportunity to align CICA’s agenda with priorities consonant with its wider regional strategy — for example, strengthening economic‑security linkages, counterterrorism cooperation, and connectivity initiatives.

- Tajikistan (2018–2020) — duration: 2 years  
  The shorter-than‑typical term is a notable deviation. Possible explanations include procedural adjustment, exceptional circumstances, or a transitional arrangement among members. Tajikistan’s leadership also brought a distinctly Central Asian security perspective, likely foregrounding border stability, counter‑terrorism, migration and water‑related issues.

- Kazakhstan (2020–2024) — duration: 4 years  
  Kazakhstan’s return to the chair confirms its sustained leadership role within CICA and illustrates how founding or early leaders may re‑emerge as stabilizing actors. The resumption of chairmanship suggests continued influence over agenda priorities and institutional continuity.

Patterns, deviations and what they mean
- Typical term length: The more recent pattern is a four‑year chair term, but Kazakhstan’s first eight‑year tenure and Tajikistan’s two‑year term are exceptions. Such anomalies can reflect transitional arrangements, changes in practice or charter, or political bargains among members.
- Geographic balance and power dynamics: Chairs have been drawn from Eurasian states — Central Asia, East Asia and the transcontinental actor Turkey — reflecting CICA’s Asia‑centred membership and an attempt at geographic diversity. Yet Kazakhstan’s repeat chairmanship signals concentrated influence; the rotation pattern suggests an informal power‑sharing equilibrium rather than strict egalitarianism.
- Issue steering: Chairs matter substantively. A chair from a Central Asian state will prioritize regional security, border management and counter‑terrorism; Turkey may prioritize connectivity and Euro‑Asian linkages; China can leverage the platform to advance economic‑security and counterterrorism initiatives consonant with its wider regional agenda.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- Agenda influence: Changes in chairmanship affect which measures rise to the top — military transparency, anti‑terror cooperation, disaster response, or connectivity. For India, this means that CICA’s utility as a platform for promoting its preferred confidence‑building measures depends in part on who holds the chair and their priorities.
- Diplomatic opportunity and risk: A chair whose priorities overlap with Indian interests (e.g., counter‑terrorism, multilateral regional security norms, infrastructure connectivity based on principles India supports) offers India opportunities for coalition‑building. Conversely, a chair that foregrounds initiatives inconsistent with India’s preferences could marginalize Indian priorities unless New Delhi engages proactively.
- Strategic posture: India’s engagement strategy within CICA should therefore be calibrated to chair rotation patterns — using summit and working‑level cycles to advance specific confidence‑building measures when institutional leadership is receptive, and investing in continuity mechanisms (expert groups, working papers) to preserve gains across chair transitions.

Institutional and research considerations
- Formal powers and selection: The exact mandates, selection procedure and powers of the CICA chair should be confirmed in primary documents (CICA founding declarations, charters and summit communiqués). Chairs may be elected, assumed by host states, or appointed by consensus — each method carries different implications for legitimacy and agenda control.
- Rotation as informal governance: The observed pattern indicates informal governance norms (geographic diversity tempered by recurring leadership from founding states). Mapping these norms against formal rules will illuminate how much of chair influence is institutionalized versus politically negotiated.
- Recommended follow‑up research steps:
  1. Consult primary sources (CICA charter, summit declarations and Secretariat records) to confirm legal basis, term lengths and selection procedures for the chair.  
  2. Map which states hosted major summits and ministerial meetings during each chair’s term to link chairmanship with concrete activities and resource allocation.  
  3. Systematically analyze summit declarations and outcome documents from each chair period to identify shifts in agenda priority and measurable outcomes tied to the chair’s leadership.

Concluding observation
Chairmanship in CICA is more than a ceremonial rotation: it shapes agenda priorities, reflects informal power distribution among Asian states, and creates windows of opportunity or constraint for member capitals — India included. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and policymakers alike, tracking chair rotation alongside primary documents and summit outcomes is essential to understand how multilateral forums like CICA can be used to advance national security objectives and regional confidence‑building.

## 2002 CICA Summit (Almaty) — Breakdown and analysis

Date and setting
- The inaugural summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) convened in Almaty, Kazakhstan on 4 June 2002. The summit produced the Almaty Act — the Charter of CICA — signed by sixteen states and attended by a broader roster of participants in observer roles.

Genesis and strategic context
- Origin: CICA was a Kazakhstan initiative under President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Proposed in the post–Cold War era, it reflected Kazakhstan’s ambition to shape a new, pan‑Asian security architecture and to elevate its diplomatic profile as a convener of regional dialogue.
- Timing: The summit occurred less than a year after the 11 September 2001 attacks and at a time when counterterrorism dominated global security discourse. This context shaped the summit’s priorities and the prominence of counterterrorism language in the Almaty Act.
- Geographic ambition: CICA sought to be cross‑regional — bringing together West, Central, South, East and Southwest Asian states — and thereby to create buy‑in across subregional divides that other mechanisms (e.g., ASEAN‑centred forums) could not wholly achieve.

Principal outcomes — the Almaty Act and institutional design
- Foundational instrument: Sixteen states signed the Almaty Act, committing to promote peace, security and stability in Asia. The Act served as a declaratory charter: normative in intent, procedural in design, but non‑binding in enforcement.
- Named principal signatories included heads of state and government such as Hamid Karzai (Afghanistan), Jiang Zemin (China), Atal Bihari Vajpayee (India), Nursultan Nazarbayev (Kazakhstan), Askar Akayev (Kyrgyzstan), Natsagiin Bagabandi (Mongolia), Pervez Musharraf (Pakistan), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Ahmet Necdet Sezer (Turkey), and Emomali Rahmon (Tajikistan). Other signatories or high‑level delegates represented Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Israel, Egypt, Iran and Palestine, indicating both range and political complexity.
- Observers and international organisations: Ten additional countries — including the United States — were accorded observer status, and international organisations such as the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE) and the Arab League participated as observers. This signalled broader international interest and potential linkages to global institutions.

Norms, principles and declared priorities
- Indivisible security: The Almaty Act articulated the principle of “a common and indivisible area of security” in which states peacefully coexist. This concept — that security cannot be partitioned and that threats to one affect the whole — framed CICA’s normative remit for Asian security discourse.
- Counterterrorism emphasis: The summit adopted the CICA Declaration on Eliminating Terrorism and Promoting Dialogue among Civilizations, condemning “all forms and manifestations of terrorism” irrespective of time, place or perpetrator. Given the post‑9/11 environment, counterterrorism became the primary area of immediate convergence among disparate members.
- Dialogue and confidence‑building: Beyond military or law‑enforcement measures, the Declaration emphasised dialogue among civilizations as part of a broader strategy of confidence‑building and social resilience.

Institutional arrangements and procedural rules
- Meeting cycles: Leaders agreed a schedule of regular meetings — summits every four years, foreign ministers every two years, and annual meetings of a committee of senior officials — creating predictable institutional rhythms.
- Flexibility: The charter allowed special meetings or extraordinary summits by consensus, balancing routine governance with the capacity for ad hoc response.
- Decision‑making: CICA’s processes were consensus‑based. This model promotes inclusiveness and political legitimacy but also risks slow deliberation and potential dilution of commitments when contentious issues arise.

Political significance and symbolic value
- Diplomacy and profile: For Kazakhstan, the summit showcased its role as regional convener and enhanced its diplomatic standing. For India and other major powers, participation offered a platform to shape regional norms while engaging with a wide set of neighbours.
- Symbolic reconciling: CICA’s design — bringing rivals into the same forum (e.g., India and Pakistan; Israel/Palestine representation) — was deliberately reconciliatory, intended to create space for interaction where bilateral tensions would otherwise preclude it.

Constraints, challenges and immediate tests
- Non‑binding nature: The Almaty Act primarily sets norms and schedules. Effective implementation depends on follow‑up actions, resources and sustained political will. Declarations alone do not create enforcement mechanisms.
- Diversity and dilution: Broad membership spanning contentious dyads increases political legitimacy but also raises the risk of lowest‑common‑denominator language. Without specific, measurable confidence‑building measures (CBMs) and mechanisms for verification, commitments may remain aspirational.
- Regional tensions as a litmus test: The presence of entrenched rivalries (most notably India–Pakistan) posed immediate tests to CICA’s ability to translate dialogue into operational cooperation. Divergent threat perceptions and foreign‑policy priorities among members could limit substantive progress.
- Overlap with existing mechanisms: CICA’s agenda overlaps with other Asia‑focused security institutions — ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) — leading to questions of complementarity versus redundancy. Member states’ differential commitments to alternative forums influence CICA’s space for action.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- India’s calculus: As a founding signatory (Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee), India engaged with CICA consistent with its strategic culture of supporting multilateral, consensual fora that can augment regional stability without undermining its autonomy. CICA offered India a venue to project normative leadership on indivisible security and to deepen dialogue across subregions.
- Opportunity for norm‑setting: CICA’s emphasis on “indivisible security” and counterterrorism aligned with Indian interests in securing regional consensus against cross‑border terrorism while embedding the principle that security challenges in one part of Asia have broader implications.
- Constraints on leverage: India’s ability to use CICA to pressure adversaries (notably Pakistan) was limited by the consensus rule and the forum’s non‑binding character. Moreover, overlapping institutions (SCO in Central Asia, ARF in Southeast Asia) meant India had to balance engagement across multiple platforms.
- Practical cooperation: Real‑world gains for India would depend on the translation of CICA’s declaratory language into concrete CBMs — information sharing, joint exercises, border confidence measures — initiatives that require sustained resource commitments and trust‑building.

Assessment and potential
- Norm‑setting potential: The Almaty Act articulated a framework that, if pursued systematically, could influence normative discourses on Asian security — especially the indivisibility concept and emphasis on dialogue.
- Institutional fragility: The principal challenge remains institution‑building — converting the charter into operational mechanisms. Consensus governance, lack of enforcement tools, and member heterogeneity weaken prospects for rapid, deep integration.
- Strategic value for smaller initiators: For Kazakhstan, and similarly positioned states, such initiatives can yield disproportionate diplomatic returns by convening diverse actors and shaping agenda‑setting.

Recommendations for further study (targeted to India‑centred analysis)
- Track implementation: Systematically examine subsequent CICA summits, foreign‑minister meetings and senior‑official committees to identify concrete CBMs, outcomes and follow‑through on counterterrorism cooperation.
- Comparative institutional analysis: Compare CICA’s mandate, membership and outputs with ARF, SCO and other regional mechanisms to delineate niches, competition and complementarities — and to assess where India derives most strategic value.
- Operational CBM review: Investigate any specific confidence‑building measures adopted after 2002 and evaluate their operationalisation, effectiveness, and relevance to India’s border and counterterrorism concerns.
- External influence: Explore the role of observer states and international organisations (for example, the US, UN, OSCE) in shaping CICA’s agenda, resources and capacity‑building efforts — and what this means for India’s preferences in multilateral settings.
- Bilateral interplay: Assess how India’s bilateral counterterrorism and security engagements with neighbouring states intersect with, complement, or bypass multilateral CICA mechanisms.

Concluding observation
The 2002 Almaty summit constituted a foundational, declaratory step toward a pan‑Asian security discourse. For India, CICA represented both an opportunity to project multilateral leadership and a reminder of the limits of consensus‑based, declaratory bodies in producing enforceable security outcomes. The long‑term relevance of CICA depends on whether its normative aspirations can be translated into sustained, measurable CBMs and institutional capacity — a process requiring political will, resources and the ability to reconcile competing regional interests.

## 2006 Summit (Second CICA Summit)

Date: 17 June 2006  
Location: Almaty, Kazakhstan

Overview  
The Second Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) convened in Almaty on 17 June 2006. The meeting marked an important transition in the life of CICA from a primarily declaratory consultative forum toward a more institutionalised mechanism. Summit participants adopted two foundational instruments—the Statute of the CICA Secretariat and the Declaration of the Second CICA Summit—and made decisions that shaped CICA's institutional identity and membership composition going forward.

Participation and membership dynamics
- Heads of state and government in attendance included Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Russia, Tajikistan, Thailand and Uzbekistan.  
- Several states were represented by special envoys of their heads of state/government: Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Mongolia, Palestine, Turkey, and the Republic of Korea (ROK).  
- The Republic of Korea was admitted as the eighteenth member of CICA at the Summit.

This mix of leader‑level delegations and special envoys is analytically important. It reflected differing levels of political commitment and capability among participating states—full leader presence indicates high prioritisation, whereas envoy representation signals interest but calibrated engagement. India’s representation by special envoy, for instance, illustrates New Delhi’s cautious but constructive approach to multilateral processes in Asia: supportive of institution‑building, yet attentive to strategic autonomy and bilateral priorities.

Adopted instruments and substantive content
- Statute of the CICA Secretariat: The Summit adopted a statute creating a permanent Secretariat, hosted in Kazakhstan. The statute provided the legal and administrative basis for an institutional secretariat charged with ensuring continuity, coordinating meetings, and following up CBMs (confidence‑building measures).  
- Declaration of the Second CICA Summit: The Declaration encapsulated member states’ shared assessments of security challenges across political‑military, economic, environmental and human dimensions. It reiterated a collective desire to advance CICA from principle to practice, consolidating consensus on priorities such as counter‑terrorism, non‑proliferation, transnational crime, and crisis communication.

Institutional development and symbolism
- Establishment of the CICA Secretariat in Kazakhstan: Formally situating a Secretariat in Astana (now Nur‑Sultan) constituted an institutional milestone. It signalled a move toward regularised secretariat functions—agenda setting, documentation, coordination of CBMs—and enhanced CICA’s capacity to translate declarations into follow‑up activity.  
- Designation of CICA Day: The Summit decided to commemorate 5 October as CICA Day, marking President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s 1992 proposal to the UN General Assembly that launched the CICA concept. This symbolic act strengthened institutional continuity and Kazakhstan’s role as the originator and steward of the initiative.

Key decisions and their implications
- Creation and Statute of the Secretariat: By granting CICA an administrative backbone, the Summit sought to improve continuity and implementation capacity. In practice this raised expectations of more systematic follow‑up on agreed CBMs and of greater administrative support for workshops, expert groups and inter‑sessional work.  
- Admission of the ROK as the 18th member: ROK membership broadened CICA’s East Asian reach and signalled the organisation’s appeal beyond Central and West Asia, potentially enhancing its relevance for Northeast Asian security dialogues.  
- Declaration as a political instrument: The Summit Declaration functioned as a consensus document that consolidated a common agenda across diverse security concerns in Asia, but remained political rather than legally binding.  
- Designation of CICA Day: A deliberate act of institutional branding intended to anchor the organisation historically and politically.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For India, the 2006 Summit presented both an opportunity and a reflective test of its strategic posture. India’s envoy‑level participation was consistent with a strategic culture that prizes multilateral engagement, institutional solutions to regional problems and strategic autonomy. The institutionalisation of CICA offered New Delhi:
- A multilateral platform to engage Central Asian states, Russia, China and Korea on transnational threats (terrorism, proliferation, organised crime) without entering alliance structures.  
- An avenue to promote confidence‑building measures that can mitigate regional tensions, including crisis‑management mechanisms and information‑sharing frameworks.  
- Opportunities to balance China’s regional influence by deepening ties with other Asian states within a broad, inclusive forum.

However, India’s calibrated engagement also reflected limitations: CICA’s declaratory nature and the uncertain capacity of the new Secretariat meant tangible outcomes would depend on member political will and resources—conditions India routinely weighs when investing diplomatic capital.

Limitations, challenges and possible next steps
- From framework to practice: Declarations and statutes create expectations, but effectiveness depends on resourcing the Secretariat, establishing concrete CBMs (military transparency, hotlines, joint exercises, information exchange) and measurable follow‑up mechanisms.  
- Political will and verification: Diverse threat perceptions and divergent bilateral rivalries among members constrain enforceable commitments; CICA’s consensual approach can slow action.  
- Operationalisation: The natural next steps post‑2006 were operationalising the Secretariat, prioritising concrete CBMs, and leveraging workshops and expert groups to produce implementable measures.

Conclusion
The 2006 Almaty Summit was a pivotal moment in CICA’s evolution—symbolically consolidating its institutional foundations and signalling member intent to move beyond summitry. For India, the Summit validated a medium‑to‑long‑term opportunity to participate in an inclusive Asian security architecture consistent with its strategic culture of multilateralism and strategic autonomy. Yet, as the Summit itself implied, the depth of CICA’s contribution to regional security would ultimately depend on whether its institutional instruments were matched by sustained political will, adequate resources and a focus on implementable confidence‑building measures.

### Third CICA Summit — Istanbul, 8 June 2010

The Third Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) convened in Istanbul on 8 June 2010. Though a regional forum with limited institutional heft, the summit marked a series of incremental steps in CICA’s evolution: enlargement of membership, first rotation of the chairmanship away from Kazakhstan, adoption of a formal policy declaration and a privileges-and‑immunities convention, and an instance of overt political messaging concerning the Gaza flotilla incident. For students of India’s strategic culture, the summit is useful as a case study in how Asian multilateral initiatives attempt institutional consolidation while remaining vulnerable to bilateral and regional tensions.

Attendance and representation
- Heads of State/Government present: Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia, Turkey.  
- Deputy Heads of State/Government: Iraq, Vietnam.  
- Special envoys represented: China, Egypt, India, Israel, Jordan, Kyrgyzstan, Republic of Korea, Pakistan, Palestine, Tajikistan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates.  
- Uzbekistan was the only member not represented.

The mixed pattern of representation—several heads of state but many countries sending envoys—signals uneven levels of political commitment among members. India was present at the summit level via a special envoy, reflecting New Delhi’s cautious, interest‑driven engagement with regional groupings that do not directly shape its core security partnerships.

Membership changes and political symbolism
- Iraq and Vietnam were admitted as full members, raising CICA’s membership to 22.  
- Bangladesh was granted observer status.

These additions broadened CICA’s geographical and political footprint. For India, enlargement toward Southeast and West Asia matters because it can create forums where Indian priorities—counter‑terrorism cooperation, Afghan stability, and connectivity—are discussed more frequently. However, greater diversity also complicates consensus formation, a perennial challenge for a grouping designed to be inclusive rather than legislative.

Chairmanship rotation
- For the first time CICA’s chairmanship moved from Kazakhstan to Turkey.

The transfer of chairmanship is institutionally significant: it signals nascent procedural routines and gives an actor (Turkey, in 2010) the opportunity to shape agenda priorities. For India, such rotations mean fluctuating agenda emphases and the need to engage each chair actively to protect or advance New Delhi’s interests.

Documents adopted
- Declaration: “Constructing Cooperative Approach to Interaction and Security in Asia.”  
- Convention: “Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Secretariat, its Personnel and Representatives of Members of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia.”

The declaration sets out a broad political framework for cooperation; the convention seeks to provide the legal basis for a functioning CICA Secretariat. Together they represent a modest move toward institutionalization—important for any organization that aspires to sustained activity beyond episodic summits.

Key substantive themes in the Declaration
The declaration blends traditional and non‑traditional security concerns:
- Regional and inter‑regional security cooperation.  
- Counter‑terrorism measures.  
- Disarmament initiatives.  
- Combating illicit drug trafficking.  
- Economic issues, including repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis.  
- Environmental challenges.  
- Situations in Afghanistan and the Middle East.  
- A commitment to continue the CICA process and to initiate deliberations in line with the CICA Catalogue of Confidence‑Building Measures (CBMs).

Relevance to India: The agenda mirrors several Indian priorities—counter‑terrorism, Afghanistan stabilization, transnational narcotics control, and economic resilience. India’s advocacy for comprehensive security concepts (linking political, economic and environmental dimensions) finds resonance in the declaration. Yet moving from declaratory convergence to operational cooperation requires mechanisms India typically expects (clear mandates, resources, and practicable CBMs).

Legal and institutional significance
- The Convention on Privileges and Immunities is a concrete institutional step: it provides a legal framework intended to protect a Secretariat and its personnel, a prerequisite for a sustainable secretariat-based architecture.  
- Reaffirmation to use the CICA Catalogue of CBMs signals intent to operationalize prior agreements.

Analytical caveat: legal instruments matter only if states ratify them and provide resources. Adoption of a convention at a summit is meaningful as a marker of intent; implementation depends on subsequent domestic ratifications, budgetary commitments, and the creation of working mechanisms—areas where many regional organizations falter.

Political developments: Gaza flotilla and public diplomacy
Turkish President Abdullah Gül used the forum to articulate a strong collective rebuke of Israel for the Gaza flotilla raid, asserting that Israel “was condemned by all members save itself for its Gaza flotilla raid and ‘would suffer the consequences of its mistake.’” This episode underlines two points:
- CICA can become a stage for expressing regional political positions unrelated to the organization’s technical agenda.  
- Bilateral or regional crises (here, Turkey–Israel and the Palestinian question) can surface and shape multilateral meetings, complicating efforts to focus on confidence‑building protocols.

Implications and analytical observations
- Institutional consolidation versus fragile implementation: Adopting a privileges and immunities convention is an institutional milestone, but without ratification and funding the Secretariat will remain weak. India must weigh whether to press for practical follow‑through (ratification, budget, staffing) that would make CICA a useful instrument.  
- Broader security concept: The blending of traditional and non‑traditional topics reflects an Asian security discourse increasingly comfortable with economic and environmental dimensions. This aligns with India’s preference for comprehensive, non‑zero‑sum security approaches.  
- Membership diversity and consensus costs: New members such as Iraq and Vietnam increase the forum’s representativeness but complicate consensus—India’s diplomatic skill in coalition‑building becomes important if it wishes to shape outcomes.  
- Political salience of external crises: The Gaza flotilla episode shows how multilateral forums can amplify regional grievances. For India, which balances relations across West and Central Asia, such dynamics require careful diplomatic calibration.  
- Representation as a signal of commitment: The fact that many states sent envoys instead of heads of state signals variable priorities and limits the summit’s political weight. India’s envoy‑level participation is consistent with its calibrated engagement strategy, but sustained impact requires high‑level attention when core interests are at stake.

Recommendations and what to monitor
- Track ratification and implementation of the Convention on Privileges and Immunities: ratifications and budget allocations are the clearest indicators of institutional commitment.  
- Monitor concrete activation of the CICA Catalogue of CBMs: look for working groups, expert meetings, or pilot CBMs (e.g., information‑sharing on terrorism, joint counternarcotics initiatives).  
- Use participation levels as a proxy for political salience: frequency of head‑of‑state participation from key neighbors will indicate whether CICA is becoming a forum of consequence.  
- Manage expectations: recognize the limits of a consensus, non‑binding forum; India should seek pragmatic, issue‑based cooperation where national interests align and be cautious of overinvesting politically.

Concluding reflection for India’s strategic culture
The 2010 Istanbul summit exemplifies the incremental institutionalization path of many Asian multilateral initiatives: enlargement, formal legal steps, and agenda broadening, accompanied by persistent implementation gaps and political diversions. For India, CICA offers potential utility—another venue to advance counter‑terrorism cooperation, Afghan stability, and a comprehensive security agenda—but only if New Delhi engages selectively, presses for operational mechanisms (not only declaratory outcomes), and calibrates its involvement in light of shifting chairmanships and the forum’s susceptibility to politicization. The summit therefore reinforces a familiar feature of India’s strategic culture: preference for pragmatic multilateralism that privileges results and institutional durability over symbolic participation.

## Fourth CICA Summit — Shanghai, 21 May 2014

Overview
- The Fourth Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) Summit met in Shanghai on 21 May 2014. Presided over by H.E. Xi Jinping, then the paramount leader of the People’s Republic of China, the meeting marked a visibly elevated phase in CICA’s institutional life: China assumed the Chairmanship for the 2014–2016 period following a formal transfer from the Republic of Turkey, making China the third CICA Chair after Kazakhstan and Turkey.
- CICA’s purpose — to foster confidence‑building and dialogue across the broad political‑military, economic, environmental and human dimensions of security in Asia — situates the forum as a pan‑continental, non‑alliance mechanism rather than a binding security pact. The Shanghai Summit illustrated both the forum’s aspirations and its structural limits.

Participation and political signal
- Participation was unusually wide and senior: 26 CICA member states attended, together with 11 observers and international organizations, 2 partner international organizations, and 8 guest states and organizations. The summit recorded its largest high‑level turnout to date — 13 Heads of State or Government were present, and the UN Secretary‑General attended. Other senior delegations included vice‑presidents, deputy prime ministers and foreign ministers. The high‑level presence conferred political legitimacy on the process but, as is often the case with multilateral forums, did not automatically translate into legally binding commitments or immediate institutional deepening.

Admissions and host engagements
- The Summit admitted two new members: the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and the State of Qatar. Their accession broadened CICA’s geographic and functional scope — Bangladesh bringing added South Asian developmental and demographic weight, Qatar contributing Gulf representation and energy‑sector relevance.
- On the eve of the Summit, President Xi hosted a banquet and a gala themed “United and Harmonious Asian Countries move together towards future,” a ceremonial act intended both to cement personal diplomacy and to symbolically showcase China’s stewardship of regional dialogue.

New Asian Security Concept — content and strategic reading
- A centerpiece of Xi Jinping’s interventions was the articulation of a “New Asian Security Concept.” Its core axiom: “Asian issues should be taken care of by Asians, and Asian security should be maintained by Asians.” The formulation emphasises respect for each country’s security and advances a cooperative, shared approach to security in which regional ownership is central.
- Geopolitically, the concept can be read as an attempt to promote an Asian‑centred security discourse and to reduce reliance on extra‑regional actors — notably the United States. It signals Beijing’s desire to shape the institutional architecture of Asian security debates and to anchor discussions in regional platforms.
- Practical constraints: The concept encounters immediate practical limits. Asia’s security environment is characterised by divergent interests among states, enduring external security guarantees for some countries, and a dense web of overlapping mechanisms (ASEAN frameworks including ARF and EAS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), bilateral alliances, etc.). These realities make an Asian‑only security order aspirational rather than readily implementable.

Summit outcome — declaration and substantive agenda
- The Summit adopted a declaration entitled “On Enhancing Dialogue, Trust and Coordination for a New Asia of Peace, Stability and Cooperation.” The declaration showcased CICA’s ambition to be comprehensive in scope; it addressed both traditional and non‑traditional security concerns:
  - Traditional/security: terrorism, disarmament, and responses to specific regional situations (references to Afghanistan and the Middle East).
  - Non‑traditional: illicit drugs, organised transnational crime, food and energy security, human rights, information and communication technology (ICT), and environmental challenges.
- The declaration reaffirmed member states’ political commitment to advance the CICA process and to implement agreed confidence‑building measures (CBMs) across all dimensions — a restatement of the forum’s core raison d’être: reducing mistrust and misperception through transparency and cooperative measures rather than military commitments.

Institutional and procedural advances
- The Summit welcomed and adopted revised CICA Rules of Procedure (the formal text notes this adoption twice, an emphasis that signals Beijing’s desire for procedural consolidation during its Chairmanship). Revised rules are a necessary, if not sufficient, condition for institutionalisation; they set the parameters for deliberation, decision‑making and the Secretariat’s operations.
- On the sidelines, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the CICA Secretariat and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Secretariat. This MoU points to a pragmatic intent to coordinate among regional organisations, share best practices, and minimize duplication — and illustrates China’s broader approach of linking multiple regional initiatives.

Geopolitical significance and practical limits
- Symbolically, China’s chairing and the New Asian Security Concept signalled Beijing’s desire for a more prominent role in shaping Asian security discourse. The summit also served to give CICA a broader agenda, merging traditional and non‑traditional threats under one umbrella.
- However, the practical efficacy of CICA remains constrained by several factors:
  - Lack of enforcement mechanisms or deep integration; the forum’s outputs are declaratory and depend on member states’ political will.
  - Heterogeneity of membership: different threat perceptions and strategic priorities limit consensus on operational CBMs.
  - Overlap with other architectures: Asia’s crowded institutional landscape reduces the marginal utility of yet another forum unless it finds a distinctive niche (e.g., pan‑continental dialogue that balances Eurasian membership).
  - Potential friction with external powers: the “Asian solutions” framing may be interpreted in extra‑regional capitals as an attempt to sideline non‑regional actors, generating diplomatic counter‑responses.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- For India — whose strategic culture combines advocacy of sovereignty and regional solutions with reliance on selective external partnerships — the Shanghai Summit presented both opportunities and challenges:
  - Opportunity: CICA’s pan‑Asian reach and broad agenda (especially non‑traditional security areas such as counter‑terrorism, cyber/ICT and energy security) offer New Delhi a valuable platform to shape normative and practical responses that are not limited to Southeast Asia or purely Eurasian groupings.
  - Caution: China’s chairmanship and the New Asian Security Concept may be viewed in India as an effort to centralise regional agenda‑setting in Beijing’s orbit. India’s strategic preference for multipolarity and for preserving external partnerships (including with the United States) makes it unlikely to accept an order that implicitly seeks to exclude extra‑regional actors important to India's security calculus.
  - Pragmatism: India can pragmatically engage with CICA‑led CBMs on non‑traditional issues while preserving its policy autonomy in political‑military arenas. Participation in cross‑institutional cooperation (for example, engagements that coordinate CICA outputs with other regional mechanisms) would allow India to influence outcomes without ceding strategic discretion.
- Policy recommendations for Indian policymakers and analysts:
  - Treat CICA as a complementary multilateral platform focused on confidence‑building and non‑traditional security, not as a substitute for bilateral defence relationships or other regional mechanisms.
  - Push for concrete, measurable CBMs (transparency measures, communications hotlines, data‑sharing mechanisms on terrorism and cyber threats) rather than mere declaratory statements.
  - Monitor China‑SCO–CICA linkages and assess whether coordination produces substantive operational cooperation or primarily symbolic convergence.
  - Maintain calibrated engagement: use CICA to advance India’s normative positions (sovereignty, non‑interference, development‑centred security) while continuing to preserve strategic partnerships outside the region.

Follow‑up and avenues for research
- The Summit’s procedural and declaratory advances require careful monitoring to assess real impact. Key follow‑up items for scholars and policymakers:
  - Track implementation of the revised Rules of Procedure during China’s 2014–2016 Chairmanship: was procedural consolidation followed by concrete working groups, meetings and budgets?
  - Catalogue CBMs adopted and implemented (or not) under China’s Chairmanship — especially in areas where India has interests (counter‑terrorism, maritime confidence measures, ICT security).
  - Evaluate outcomes of the CICA–SCO MoU: did this lead to joint activities, coordinated agendas, or merely information exchange?
  - Observe external reactions (Washington, Tokyo, Moscow, EU capitals) to the New Asian Security Concept and any diplomatic re‑calibrations.
  - Analyse whether admission of Bangladesh and Qatar changed intramural dynamics or expanded issue salience (e.g., South Asian development issues, Gulf energy security).
- Conclusion: The 2014 Shanghai Summit was a moment of symbolic and procedural consolidation for CICA under China’s stewardship. For India, it presented a familiar strategic trade‑off — the chance to shape a regionally centred security discourse and to promote cooperative CBMs, against the risk that a China‑led architecture may seek to circumscribe the role of external partners important to Indian security. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, the Summit underscores New Delhi’s enduring preference for engagement across multiple multilateral platforms while retaining strategic autonomy.

### The Fifth CICA Summit (Dushanbe, 15 June 2019)

Factual summary
- Event: Fifth Summit of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA).
- Date and place: 15 June 2019, Dushanbe, Republic of Tajikistan.
- Presiding official: Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of Tajikistan, acted as Summit President/host.
- Participation: Described by hosts as the largest ever head‑of‑state/government turnout at a CICA Summit — fifteen Heads of State and Government attended. In addition, a wide array of high‑level dignitaries were present, including vice‑presidents, foreign ministers and ambassadors.

CICA in brief and summit context
- CICA is an intergovernmental forum founded to promote peace, security and confidence‑building across Asia. Its membership and participant mix intentionally spans a wide geographic and political spectrum within Asia, bringing together states with divergent strategic priorities and historical rivalries.
- Summits like Dushanbe 2019 are designed to provide a political apex for CICA activity: they serve both to reaffirm the forum’s declaratory commitments and to provide a platform for agenda‑setting and high‑level signalling among Asian states.

Why the Dushanbe summit mattered
- Host presidency: That President Rahmon presided over the Summit is both customary and significant. The host head‑of‑state chairing such a meeting elevates national visibility and gives the host additional informal leverage to shape the summit’s emphases and procedural outcomes. For Tajikistan, a country with acute concerns about border security, transnational extremism and resource‑sharing in Central Asia, hosting CICA was an opportunity to place these issues on a continental agenda.
- Scale and symbolism of attendance: Fifteen heads of state and government attending transformed the Dushanbe meeting from a technical multilateral forum into an event of substantive political weight. High‑level attendance confers legitimacy on CICA as a space for strategic dialogue and increases the potential political salience of any communiqués or joint statements issued.

Typical agenda items and likely emphases in Dushanbe
- CICA summits routinely address a core group of issues: regional security cooperation (including counter‑terrorism and counter‑radicalization), arms control confidence measures, economic and infrastructure cooperation, and concrete confidence‑building measures aimed at reducing misperception and crisis escalation between neighbours.
- Given Tajikistan’s priorities and the Central Asian setting, topics such as border security, counter‑extremism, water‑energy management, and infrastructural connectivity were likely to feature prominently in both the plenary and in bilateral talks on the margins.

Diplomatic architecture and practical dynamics
- The presence of vice‑presidents, foreign ministers and ambassadors alongside heads of state creates a two‑track dynamic: the heads of state provide political signals and legitimacy; ministers and diplomats conduct the technical negotiations and draft the operational language of any declarations. This combination increases the summit’s capacity to produce substantive output while also enabling swift bilateral engagement between leaders.
- Large, diverse participation improves the forum’s representative credentials but complicates decision‑making. CICA’s consensus‑oriented culture means that deeper, binding commitments require alignment among many actors with differing strategic priorities.

Follow‑on possibilities and limits
- High‑level summits create the conditions for several post‑summit outcomes: a joint communiqué or political declaration, the establishment or reactivation of working groups, and numerous bilateral agreements concluded on the margins. However, the scope and durability of any decisions depend on the degree of consensus achieved and the willingness of major actors to resource follow‑through.
- Because CICA lacks supranational enforcement mechanisms, its utility often lies in confidence‑building, information exchange and norm setting rather than in imposing concrete security guarantees.

Implications for India’s strategic posture
- India’s engagement with CICA — as a participant in a pan‑Asian security forum — aligns with its long‑standing preference for multilateral mechanisms that emphasize dialogue, incremental confidence‑building and sovereignty principles. High‑level summits such as Dushanbe provide New Delhi with multiple advantages:
  - Political signalling: Participation by the Indian head of government or senior ministers signals India’s claim to be a major Asian security stakeholder and reinforces its image as a proponent of multilateral dialogue.
  - Issue framing: In forums where agenda items include counter‑terrorism, connectivity and resource security, India can push language that reflects its priorities (e.g., terrorism as a cross‑border threat, secure and transparent connectivity projects).
  - Bilateral diplomacy: The margins of large summits offer important opportunities for India to pursue bilateral talks with Central Asian states, Russia, China and other partners, advancing energy, security and counter‑radicalization cooperation in formats outside strictly bilateral channels.
  - Constraints: The diversity of CICA membership — including states with competing interests — limits the forum’s ability to produce binding outcomes that might advance India’s more ambitious strategic goals. Consensus‑seeking can dilute the force of declarations on sensitive matters, especially when core regional rivals are present.
- In sum, the Dushanbe Summit underscored both the promise and the structural limits of multilateral confidence‑building in Asia. For India, such summits are valuable instruments of external projection and diplomatic networking, albeit ones whose concrete security returns depend on careful follow‑through and complementary bilateral arrangements.

Concluding assessment
- The Fifth CICA Summit in Dushanbe was significant less for immediate, binding outcomes than for its demonstration that a broad cross‑section of Asian leaders were willing to engage in a multilateral setting. For host Tajikistan it was an occasion to highlight regional security priorities; for participants — including India — it was an arena to signal intentions, build interpersonal leader‑level ties, and seek incremental progress on shared concerns. As part of India’s strategic toolkit, CICA‑type engagements reinforce a preference for multilateral confidence‑building while also highlighting the limits of consensus‑based regional mechanisms when confronting deeply divergent national interests.

### Sixth CICA Summit (Astana, 12–13 October 2022)

Short summary  
A two‑day, high‑level meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) was held in Astana, Kazakhstan on 12–13 October 2022. President Kassym‑Jomart Tokayev of Kazakhstan presided. As a summit‑level gathering of CICA member and observer states, the meeting aimed to advance the organisation’s core mandate of interaction and confidence‑building across political, security, economic and humanitarian dimensions in Asia.

1. Event essentials
- Name and format: Sixth CICA Summit — a summit signifies participation at the highest political level (heads of state/government and senior ministers).  
- Dates and venue: 12–13 October 2022, Astana, Kazakhstan.  
- Presiding official: Kassym‑Jomart Tokayev, President of Kazakhstan, acting as host and chair.

2. CICA’s institutional purpose and remit
- Mandate: CICA is a regional multilateral platform designed to enhance dialogue and confidence‑building measures across Asia. Its remit spans political and military‑security cooperation, economic interaction, environmental and resource issues, and humanitarian concerns.  
- Functional logic: CICA’s architecture is deliberately broad — meant to reduce mistrust, prevent crises through transparency and CBMs (confidence‑building measures), and provide a forum for normative and operational collaboration short of formal security alliances.

3. Host significance: Kazakhstan’s convening role
- Symbolic leadership: Kazakhstan’s role as host and chair underscores Astana’s active diplomacy and desire to shape regional architectures. Hosting a summit and presiding over deliberations gives the host agenda‑setting advantages (priority themes, procedural stewardship) and enhanced visibility as a regional balancer.  
- Practical leverage: Chairmanship permits Kazakhstan to highlight issues consonant with its security priorities (border management, counterterrorism, transnational threats, connectivity) and to marshal support for initiatives of national interest.

4. Typical summit agenda and likely topics (and why they matter)
- Security and crisis management: CBMs to reduce the risk of misperception, border confidence measures, mechanisms for preventing escalation. These are central to CICA’s raison d’être.  
- Counterterrorism and violent extremism: cooperation on intelligence sharing, capacity building for law enforcement and judicial cooperation.  
- Economic connectivity and infrastructure: cross‑border trade facilitation, transport corridors, and linkages that buttress stability through interdependence.  
- Humanitarian and environmental challenges: pandemic response lessons, disaster relief cooperation, and climate‑related security pressures.  
- Rationale: Each theme responds to the dual logic of CICA — reducing immediate security risks while building longer‑term cooperative frameworks that make conflict less likely.

5. Participation and diplomatic weight
- Who attends: Member and observer states of CICA, invited organisations and, where appropriate, heads of state or government. Summit attendance at the highest level increases the political salience of outcomes and often yields declaratory texts with greater commitment value.  
- Decision dynamics: While CICA is not a treaty organisation with binding enforcement mechanisms, summit communiqués and joint statements serve as political commitments that can nudge national policies, open avenues for bilateral or multilateral follow‑on projects, and create reputational incentives.

6. Expected outcomes and where to verify them
- Typical outputs: Joint communiqué, chair’s statement, declarations on thematic issues, agreements on future meetings or working groups, and possible launches of capacity‑building initiatives.  
- Caveat: The precise content and legal/political weight of any measure depend on summit negotiations; therefore the authoritative record is the official summit communiqué and any annexed agreements.  
- Verification sources: CICA Secretariat releases, Kazakhstan’s presidential office or Ministry of Foreign Affairs statements, accredited diplomatic notes, and reporting from reputable international think tanks and media outlets.

7. Timing and broader context (why October 2022 matters)
- Post‑COVID and heightened tensions: The summit took place during a period of lingering pandemic effects on diplomacy and an environment of elevated global and regional security tensions. These contextual pressures shape both priorities (e.g., public health cooperation, supply‑chain resilience) and the political language of statements (emphasis on stability and non‑interference).  
- Regional flashpoints: Ongoing geopolitical realignments in Eurasia and South Asia mean that CICA’s role as a confidence‑building forum is both tested and potentially valuable as a venue for risk reduction.

8. Strategic implications for India
- Platform value for India: CICA provides India a broad, Asia‑wide multilateral forum to promote its strategic priorities: stability through dialogue, counterterrorism, connectivity (including alternative regional initiatives), and norms of non‑interference and sovereignty.  
- Diplomatic utility: Participation allows India to project leadership on chosen themes, to build coalitions on issues such as terror financing and border management, and to use summit declarations to reinforce its policy preferences in an Asian framework.  
- Constraints and opportunities: Because CICA is consensus‑oriented and non‑binding, India cannot expect legally enforceable outcomes but can use the forum for agenda‑shaping, norm promotion, and confidence‑building with states across a spectrum of relations — especially Central Asian neighbors where India has growing interests.  
- Practical follow‑through: For India, effective use of CICA requires translating summit declarations into bilateral or multilateral initiatives (training, capacity building, infrastructure projects) that advance New Delhi’s strategic culture of statecraft combining principled multilateralism with pragmatic cooperation.

9. Suggested follow‑up actions for researchers and policymakers
- Consult primary documents: Read the official Sixth CICA Summit communiqué and Kazakhstan’s official statements to ascertain agreed language and commitments.  
- Analyze participant statements: Review speeches by key delegations (including India) for signals of policy priorities and red lines.  
- Track implementation: Monitor subsequent working group meetings, announced capacity‑building projects, or bilateral initiatives that operationalise summit texts.  
- Read secondary analyses: Look for assessments by regional think tanks and expert commentary that situate the summit within evolving Eurasian security architectures.

Concluding remark  
The Sixth CICA Summit in Astana was a compact example of how regionally focused, confidence‑building multilateralism operates: symbolic host leadership, summit‑level political engagement, and declaratory outcomes intended to reduce mistrust and promote cooperation. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, CICA offers a non‑confrontational multilateral channel to consolidate regional stability objectives, pursue counterterrorism and connectivity goals, and engage Central Asian partners within a wider Asian security‑diplomatic framework. For definitive conclusions about outcomes and concrete commitments, scholars and policymakers should anchor analysis in the official summit documents and track subsequent implementation steps.

### 4.X The First CICA Ministerial (Almaty, 14 September 1999): Foundations, Content and Significance for Indian Strategic Culture

Concise summary  
On 14 September 1999, Kazakhstan hosted the first Ministerial Meeting of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) in Almaty. Fifteen states participated as members and a number of regional and extra‑regional states and organisations attended as observers. Ministers adopted and signed the Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between CICA Member States, a political text that established a set of normative benchmarks — reaffirmation of the UN Charter; sovereign equality; non‑use of force; territorial integrity; peaceful settlement of disputes; non‑intervention; aspirational commitments to disarmament; promotion of economic, social and cultural cooperation; and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Factual matrix of the meeting
- Event: First CICA Ministerial Meeting.  
- Date and place: 14 September 1999, Almaty, Kazakhstan.  
- Member states present (15): Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Palestine, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan.  
- Observer states/participants: United States, Japan, Indonesia, Republic of Korea (South Korea), Malaysia, Mongolia, Ukraine.  
- International organisations represented: United Nations (UN) and Organization for Security and Co‑operation in Europe (OSCE).  
- Outcome: Signing of the “Declaration on Principles Guiding Relations between CICA Member States,” listing core norms for interstate conduct.

What the Declaration says (core principles)
- Reaffirmation of the UN Charter as the foundational legal and normative anchor.  
- Respect for sovereign equality of states.  
- Commitment to refrain from threat or use of force between states.  
- Respect for territorial integrity and political independence.  
- Peaceful settlement of disputes consistent with the Declaration, UN Charter and international law.  
- Refraining from intervention in one another’s internal affairs.  
- Support for “general and complete disarmament under effective control” (an aspirational formula).  
- Enhanced economic, social and cultural cooperation among members.  
- Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Contextual and regional relevance (brief analysis)
- CICA — the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia — was conceived as a wide‑ranging Asian security and confidence‑building forum. The Almaty ministerial was a foundational political act intended to create a common vocabulary for interaction across a geographically and politically diverse region.  
- Kazakhstan’s role as convener underlines the importance of Central Asian agency in pan‑Asian security dialogues.  
- The membership list signals breadth: Central, South, East, West Asia and actors from the Middle East (Egypt, Israel, Palestine), as well as major powers (China, Russia). That geographical span made CICA distinct from more narrowly regional forums.  
- The presence of adversarial neighbours (notably India and Pakistan; India and China) demonstrates the forum’s intended role as a neutral space for confidence‑building among rivals.  
- Observer participation by the US, Japan and South Korea, and the attendance of the UN and OSCE, indicate wider international interest and a degree of external legitimisation — and potential linkage between Euro‑Atlantic and Asian security architectures.

Legal and institutional character of the Declaration
- The Declaration is principally political and declaratory. Its reaffirmation of the UN Charter places its language within established international law, but the text itself does not create binding treaty obligations.  
- Principles such as sovereignty, non‑use of force and non‑intervention mirror customary international law and treaty norms, but their practical meaning and application can vary among members depending on national interests and contested regional claims.  
- The disarmament language — “general and complete disarmament under effective control” — is programmatic. It signals normative intent rather than establishing verification, institutional control or enforcement mechanisms.

Strategic implications and challenges — with emphasis on India
- Strategic significance: Bringing together adversaries and major regional actors in a single framework creates diplomatic space for confidence‑building and norm formation. For India, CICA presented an opportunity to project a commitment to multilateral dialogue across Asia and to situate Indian security diplomacy within broader regional processes.  
- Practical limits: The Declaration establishes a baseline of shared rhetoric but lacks specific enforcement, verification, or dispute‑settlement mechanisms. Without follow‑up institutional machinery (working groups, verification bodies, arbitration or mediation modalities), declaratory texts risk remaining aspirational.  
- India’s strategic posture: India traditionally emphasises sovereignty and non‑intervention — principles embedded in the Declaration — while simultaneously safeguarding strategic autonomy. CICA fit India’s predilection for multipolar, institutionally plural engagement (simultaneously pursuing bilateral ties, groupings such as the SCO later, and global institutions) but India has also been cautious about regional frameworks that might constrain its freedom of action.  
- Nuclear dimension: India’s nuclear status and its doctrinal insistence on credible deterrence complicate any regional movement towards “complete disarmament.” For India, commitments on disarmament in multilateral declarations are read against the realities of deterrence and the need for credible security.  
- Human rights and domestic politics: References to human rights are politically sensitive. India’s approach balances normative commitments with concerns about sovereignty and non‑interference; domestically contested human‑rights issues mean such clauses are often treated as general rather than operational commitments.  
- External observers: Engagement by the US, Japan and others can add technical resources and diplomatic interest to CICA, but some regional actors may view extensive extra‑regional presence with suspicion. India’s own position has been to welcome constructive external engagement while guarding against undue external influence that could skew regional balances.

Institutional follow‑through and practical prospects
- Foundational, not final: The Almaty Declaration should be read as a political foundation — a text establishing shared language for subsequent activity. Implementation would require sustained follow‑up: working groups, confidence‑building measures, verification and dispute‑settlement mechanisms.  
- Path to operationalisation: For CICA to have substantive security impact, states would need to translate declaratory principles into concrete measures (e.g., information exchanges, military transparency measures, joint training, conflict‑prevention hotlines, or agreed arbitration procedures). None of these mechanisms were exhaustively created by the 1999 declaration.  
- Linkages: OSCE presence points to potential cross‑fertilisation between European experience in confidence‑building and nascent Asian practice; such linkages could facilitate technical assistance for verification and monitoring but require political consent.

Practical takeaways and recommendations for readers interested in India’s security policy
- Treat the 1999 Almaty Declaration as a normative baseline, not a legally binding regime. Its value lies in creating a shared vocabulary for future cooperation.  
- Track participation and activity: Observe which members become active in follow‑up CICA work versus which remain largely symbolic participants — this signals the forum’s practical relevance. India’s consistent engagement (or lapses) within CICA help reveal how New Delhi balances multilateralism with strategic autonomy.  
- Seek evidence of operationalisation: Look for later CICA documents, working groups or joint measures dealing with arms control, verification, dispute resolution or human‑rights cooperation. These are the concrete indicators that declaratory commitments are being implemented.  
- Consider the role of external actors and organisations: Observer states and international organisations can supply legitimacy, expertise and linkage, but their engagement also reshapes regional dynamics. For India, accepting external technical assistance is conditional on preserving strategic independence.

Concluding note
The Almaty ministerial of 1999 was a seminal, declaratory step in the institutional life of CICA — a move to articulate a common normative framework across a complex and contested Asian security space. For India, the Declaration resonated with long‑standing principles (sovereignty, non‑intervention, multilateral dialogue) while also exposing the limits of declaratory diplomacy when core strategic issues (territorial disputes, deterrence, divergent threat perceptions) require detailed mechanisms and political will for implementation. Subsequent CICA activity — and India’s pattern of engagement with it — is therefore the crucial test of whether the Almaty text would remain a diplomatic touchstone or evolve into operational regional cooperation.

## The Second CICA Ministerial (Almaty, 22 October 2004): Institutionalisation, Confidence-Building and Implications for India

On 22 October 2004 the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) convened its second Ministerial Meeting in Almaty. This session marked a decisive shift in CICA’s evolution from a loose consultative forum toward a more institutionalised multilateral mechanism for managing Asian security challenges. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the Almaty meeting is important because it produced foundational instruments that both reflected and shaped how Asian states — including India — could pursue regional stability through dialogue, transparency and agreed procedures.

Key decisions and instruments adopted
- CICA Catalogue of Confidence‑Building Measures (CBMs): a compendium of practical measures intended to reduce mistrust and the risk of inadvertent escalation. Typical measures in such a catalogue include military transparency (notifications of major exercises, exchange of defence information), crisis‑communication mechanisms and hotlines, joint disaster relief cooperation and exercises, non‑use‑of‑force assurances, and cooperative training to reduce misperception.
- CICA Rules of Procedure: a formal set of provisions covering decision‑making, membership admission and observer status, chairmanship, the types of meetings CICA would hold, and detailed meeting procedures. These rules were an essential step toward predictability and institutional continuity.
- Declaration of the CICA Ministerial Meeting: a political statement that assessed regional and global security developments and reiterated collective positions — notably explicit references to Afghanistan, Iraq, the Middle East, the South Caucasus, and the Korean Peninsula, and a firm condemnation of terrorism in all forms.

Membership and representation
- Thailand was admitted at Almaty as the 17th member, expanding geographic inclusivity into Southeast Asia. The enlargement signalled CICA’s ambition to embrace a wide cross‑section of Asian actors and to incorporate Southeast Asian perspectives into continental security dialogues.

Decision‑making and chairmanship: consensus and later amendment
- Decision rule: The 2004 Rules of Procedure enshrined consensus as the decision‑making method at all levels. This explicit emphasis on consensus is one of the most important operational traits of CICA: it seeks legitimacy and equal ownership among diverse members by requiring broad agreement.
- Amendment (1 September 2009): The Rules were modified to shorten the chairmanship period from four years to two years. Chairmanship was made host‑linked: the state hosting a regular Summit serves as Chairman until the next regular meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs, and the state hosting the regular meeting of Ministers serves as Chairman until the next regular Summit. This alternation ties the Chair to meeting hosts and increases rotation.

Analytical implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
1. Institutionalisation aligns with India’s preference for multilateral processes
   - India’s strategic culture values multilateral forums that preserve state sovereignty while enabling cooperative problem‑solving. The Almaty outcomes — a catalogue of CBMs and a written procedural code — reflected this approach: they create norms and predictable practices without supranational authority.
2. Consensus rule: legitimacy vs. effectiveness
   - Pros for India: Consensus protects sovereign prerogatives and prevents great‑power imposition; it allows India to shape outcomes and block measures contrary to its interests.
   - Cons: Consensus can slow decision‑making and permit single states to stall initiatives. For India, this means that while CICA can be an important platform for normative leadership (e.g., anti‑terrorism, non‑use of force), translating declarations into timely action may be difficult.
3. CBMs as tools to manage India’s immediate security concerns
   - Catalogue measures such as military transparency, crisis hotlines and cooperative disaster response are directly relevant to India’s concerns about inadvertent escalation with neighbours, maritime safety, and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR). India can use CICA CBMs to institutionalise exchanges that reduce mistrust with proximate states and to frame cooperative responses to transnational threats (terrorism, natural disasters).
4. Enlargement and regional balance
   - Thailand’s admission broadened CICA’s geographic scope to include more Southeast Asian voices. For India, a wider membership presents both opportunity and complexity: it allows New Delhi to build broader coalitions on issues such as terrorism and Afghanistan, but also necessitates diplomatic engagement across a wider set of regional priorities and perspectives.
5. Chairmanship rotation: participation vs. continuity
   - Reducing the chairmanship period increases opportunities for more members (including India) to lead the agenda, reflecting India’s interest in equitable regional governance. But shorter terms may reduce policy continuity unless robust handover procedures are institutionalised. India’s role, whether as chair or participant, will therefore matter in sustaining medium‑term initiatives.

Contextual relevance (2004)
- The Almaty meeting occurred in a security environment marked by the aftermath of 9/11, ongoing instability in Afghanistan, the US‑led invasion of Iraq (2003) and its regional reverberations, persistent tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and unresolved conflicts in the Middle East and the South Caucasus. These conditions made practical CBMs and political coordination — especially on counter‑terrorism — urgent priorities for CICA members.

Operational and policy recommendations for Indian decision‑makers
- Monitor and promote CBM implementation: Track whether catalogue measures are followed in practice (exercise notifications, information exchanges, hotline activations). India should champion pilot CBMs in subregions where mutual gains are evident (e.g., HADR, counter‑piracy, disaster cooperation).
- Use CICA for counter‑terrorism normative leadership: The 2004 Declaration’s strong language against terrorism offers India a diplomatic platform to push for operational cooperation (information‑sharing, capacity building) while preserving non‑alignment‑consistent norms.
- Assess consensus dynamics: Maintain flexible diplomacy to prevent deadlock while preserving veto leverage. India should seek coalition‑building to convert broad declarations into implementable measures that can survive consensus requirements.
- Leverage chairmanship opportunities but plan continuity: If India assumes chairing responsibilities or hosts meetings, it should prepare clear handover plans and priority‑setting documents to ensure two‑year terms produce lasting initiatives.
- Integrate CICA outputs with bilateral and other multilateral efforts: To avoid duplication and maximise impact, India should correlate CICA CBMs with other mechanisms (e.g., SCO, ASEAN mechanisms, BIMSTEC) and with bilateral confidence‑building where relevant.

Concluding assessment
The Almaty Ministerial of 2004 was a turning point in CICA’s trajectory — the adoption of a CBM catalogue and formal Rules of Procedure signalled institutionalisation and an intent to make dialogue operational. For India, CICA represents a congenial multilateral modality that fits core elements of its strategic culture: emphasis on sovereignty, preference for consensus, and a pragmatic willingness to use institutional tools to mitigate regional insecurity. The practical challenge for Indian policy is to convert the legitimacy afforded by consensus and procedural rules into concrete, verifiable cooperation — using the forum to manage crises, combat terrorism, and build durable transparency mechanisms without sacrificing policy agility.

### 3rd Meeting of CICA Foreign Ministers (Almaty, 25 August 2008): Outcomes and Significance for India

Brief summary
- On 25 August 2008 ministers of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA) convened their Third Meeting in Almaty. The session admitted two new full members (the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the United Arab Emirates), granted observer status to the State of Qatar, reviewed progress on Confidence‑Building Measures (CBMs), and adopted a set of conclusions and legal/procedural documents designed to strengthen CICA’s institutional capacity and to prepare for the heads‑of‑state summit cycle leading to 2010.

Context and formal decisions
- Event and venue: Third CICA Ministerial, Almaty, Kazakhstan (25 August 2008).
- Membership changes: Jordan and the UAE were admitted as full members, taking the membership roster to twenty states. Qatar was granted observer status.
- Documents adopted: Ministers issued a Declaration entitled “CICA Progress in Implementation of CBMs,” adopted the Conclusions of the Third Meeting (which mapped members’ work on mandates from the 2006 Summit), adopted a Protocol amending the Statute of the CICA Secretariat (permitting relocation from Almaty to Astana), and accepted in principle a “Convention on the Legal Capacity of CICA Secretariat, its Personnel and their Privileges and Immunities.”
- Next steps urged: Ministers called on member states to finalize their internal procedures so that they could sign and ratify the Convention, thereby granting the Secretariat international legal personality and the usual privileges and immunities.

Substantive content: CBMs, roles and institutionalisation
- The Declaration reaffirmed CICA’s raison d’être as a multilateral forum for continuous dialogue and close cooperation across Asia. It emphasized the organization’s function in addressing emergent threats, preventing conflicts, and settling disputes peacefully through the development and implementation of Confidence‑Building Measures.
- CBMs were central to ministerial deliberations. The meeting welcomed the commencement of CBM implementation and commended the work of coordinating and co‑coordinating states charged with drafting and piloting specific measures. In conceptual terms, the CBMs under discussion encompass the familiar matrix used by regional security practitioners: military transparency, information exchange, crisis communications, joint trainings/exercises, border and maritime cooperation, and mechanisms to reduce the risk of accidental escalation.
- The ministerial review process mapped progress against mandates from the Second CICA Summit (2006) and prepared the institutional and substantive agenda for the next summit in 2010—illustrating a summit‑driven, iterative mode of multilateral institutionalisation.

Institutional and legal implications
- Secretariat amendment: By adopting a Protocol permitting transfer of the CICA Secretariat from Almaty to Astana, ministers aligned institutional presence with Kazakhstan’s evolving political geography. Such a move has practical consequences for staffing, host‑state relations, logistics and budgetary allocations.
- Legal capacity instrument: Adoption in principle of the Convention on the Secretariat’s legal capacity, privileges and immunities is a standard but essential step in converting CICA from a loose consultative forum into a functioning international organisation. The Convention would confer legal personality, tax and customs exemptions, immunity from jurisdiction for official acts, and other protections that allow an international secretariat to function independently.
- Procedural reality: “Adopted in principle” signals that domestic ratification/approval remains necessary. Ministers’ urging to complete internal procedures highlighted the gap between agreeable texts and enforceable, binding institutional arrangements.

Regional security backdrop and unstated urgency
- The meeting occurred against a moment of elevated regional tensions in August 2008. While the communiqué did not explicitly link events, the imperative driving ministers was clear: CBMs and institutionalised dialogue gain urgency when regional crises threaten to spill over or when states perceive misperception risks. This temporal context helps explain the emphasis on operational CBMs and the need to cement the Secretariat’s capacities.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- Fit with Indian strategic preferences: CICA’s stress on dialogue, preventive measures and multilateral CBMs dovetails with India’s longstanding predilection for multilaterally‑anchored confidence building, strategic autonomy, and preference for institutionalised mechanisms to manage interstate frictions. For New Delhi, CICA provides a platform compatible with its strategic culture—one that favours negotiated risk‑reduction over alliance‑driven balancing.
- Opportunities from membership expansion: The admission of Jordan and the UAE and observer status for Qatar widen CICA’s geographic reach into the Middle East/Gulf. For India, this enlargement creates an additional multilateral channel to engage Gulf partners on issues touching its national security and economic interests—energy security, migrant labour protection, counter‑terrorism, and maritime security in the Indian Ocean littoral. It also means CICA’s agenda can more readily accommodate cross‑regional linkages important to India.
- Operational potential: India can use CICA’s CBM framework to pursue practical measures consonant with its priorities—border confidence building with neighbouring states, crisis‑communication hotlines, cooperation on counter‑terrorism and radicalisation prevention, and maritime domain awareness initiatives linked to Indian Ocean security.
- Institutional tasks: The Secretariat’s relocation and the proposed Convention create procedural tasks for India as a member. If New Delhi wishes to be a signatory to the Convention it must complete relevant internal procedures (executive approval and, where necessary, parliamentary ratification). Assessing the legal and fiscal implications of immunities, and aligning them with India’s domestic law, will be part of this process.
- Strategic caveats: While CICA expands a multilateral repertoire, its effectiveness depends on political will among coordinating states to implement CBMs and on the Secretariat’s operational capacity. India should calibrate expectations—use the forum pragmatically to advance specific, feasible measures rather than as a vehicle for sweeping institutional transformations.

Recommended short list for Indian policymakers
- Engage actively in coordinating/co‑coordinating roles for realistic CBM pilots that align with India’s security priorities (maritime surveillance, counter‑terrorism cooperation, disaster response).
- Complete domestic procedures for the Secretariat Convention if India judges that legalisation will enhance CICA’s utility and protect Indian personnel/experts who may serve in the Secretariat.
- Leverage the widening membership (Gulf entrants/observers) to create India‑CENTRE synergies on energy security, migrant diaspora protection, and maritime security in the Indian Ocean region.
- Push for transparency and reporting mechanisms so that the 2010 Summit can review concrete, measurable CBM outcomes rather than aspirational declarations.

Conclusion
The Third CICA Ministerial in Almaty consolidated the organisation’s slow institutionalisation—membership expansion, operational CBM work and movement toward a legally empowered Secretariat. For India the meeting reaffirms the value of multilateral, dialogue‑based instruments consonant with its strategic culture; but it also underscores the practical work required—domestic ratifications, focused pilot CBMs and sustained diplomatic effort—if CICA is to become a reliable instrument of Asian preventive diplomacy and cooperative security.

### 4.4 The Fourth Meeting of CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs (Astana, 12 September 2012): Facts, Content and Implications for India

Summary
- Event: Fourth Meeting of CICA (Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia) Ministers of Foreign Affairs.
- Date and place: Astana, Republic of Kazakhstan; 12 September 2012.
- Participants: Ministers and special envoys from CICA Member States.
- Presidency/Chairing: Jointly presided by the Foreign Ministers of Turkey and Kazakhstan (reflecting CICA chairmanship and host-country role).
- Preceding event: A commemorative session marking CICA’s twentieth anniversary; President Nursultan Nazarbayev addressed participants.
- Outcome: Adoption of a comprehensive ministerial declaration covering terrorism, disarmament, illicit drugs, energy security, environment, and regional situations in Afghanistan and the Middle East.
- Institutional/operational decisions: Encouragement to implement military-political confidence‑building measures (CBMs); initiation of a CICA Action Plan to implement the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy; constitution of a CICA Business Council; exploration of road and rail connectivity projects; finalisation of revised rules of procedure.

Context and institutional background
CICA was launched by Kazakhstan in 1992 as a regional platform intended to reduce tensions and enhance cooperation across the Eurasian space. By its twentieth anniversary, CICA had evolved into a broadly inclusive political forum that emphasises confidence‑building, preventive diplomacy and issue‑based cooperation rather than a treaty‑based security alliance. Nazarbayev’s commemorative address in Astana underscored Kazakhstan’s foundational and stewardship role in creating a pan‑Asian mechanism to manage inter-state trust deficits.

Substantive content of the Astana declaration
The ministerial declaration adopted at the meeting was wide‑ranging but characteristically political and consensus‑driven. Its principal themes were:
- Counter‑terrorism: endorsement of a CICA Action Plan to operationalise the UN Global Counter‑Terrorism Strategy within the CICA framework.
- Military‑political CBMs: encouragement for member states to commence implementation of CBMs aimed at transparency and risk reduction.
- Disarmament and non‑proliferation: normative references to the need for restraint and confidence measures in areas of strategic capability.
- Illicit drugs and Afghanistan: recognition of Afghanistan’s narcotics problem as a regional security threat and call for cooperative responses.
- Energy security and environment: acceptance of non‑traditional security threats and the need for joint management.
- Regional situations: statements addressing stability concerns in Afghanistan and the Middle East.
- Economic and institutional initiatives: decision to form a CICA Business Council and to explore transport connectivity (road and rail) within the CICA region.
- Institutional consolidation: agreement to finalise revised rules of procedure to clarify working methods and follow‑up mechanisms.

Nature and limits of the commitments
It is important to note that ministerial declarations in CICA are political, consensus‑based and largely non‑binding. They set priorities and political intent rather than create enforceable legal obligations. The Astana decisions therefore signalled intent — and areas for practical work — rather than immediate operational programmes. Implementation would depend on national political will, resources, coordination mechanisms and follow‑up.

Operational elements: CBMs, counter‑terrorism and institutional tools
- Military‑political CBMs: Practical measures could include prior notification of major exercises, transparency on force postures near sensitive borders, military hotlines, and information exchanges — all designed to reduce misperception and inadvertent escalation.
- Counter‑terrorism Action Plan: By linking CICA work to the UN Global Counter‑Terrorism Strategy, states sought to harmonise regional action with a universal normative framework, thereby enhancing legitimacy and scope for coordination on capacity building, legal measures and information sharing.
- CICA Business Council: Creating a formal channel for business and private‑sector participation signals an effort to connect security dialogue to economic interests, mobilise financing and bring practitioner expertise to connectivity projects.
- Connectivity focus: Road and rail link discussions aimed to promote trade, transit and economic interdependence across Eurasia, intersecting with concurrent initiatives (e.g., TRACECA, bilateral corridor projects, and later Belt and Road dynamics).

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
1. Multilateral engagement and norms: India treats CICA as a venue consistent with its preference for regionally‑rooted, consensus‑based multilateralism. The Astana outcomes offer India a platform to promote norms of non‑interference, respect for sovereignty and cooperative approaches to transnational threats.
2. Counter‑terrorism cooperation: The Action Plan and UN linkage align with India’s long‑standing emphasis on global counter‑terrorism frameworks, domestically and in fora that enable intelligence sharing, capacity building and legal cooperation on terrorism financing.
3. Afghanistan and narcotics: CICA’s explicit attention to Afghanistan’s narcotics problem resonates with India’s security concerns about regional instability and drug trafficking routes; India can leverage CICA to coordinate developmental and border security responses with Central Asian partners.
4. Connectivity and economic diplomacy: Discussions on road and rail links provide a multilateral architecture that complements India’s connectivity initiatives (overland and maritime) and opens possibilities for public–private partnerships via the Business Council, though India will weigh sovereignty and strategic control over transit routes.
5. Confidence‑building in the military‑political sphere: CBMs promoted in CICA can reinforce India’s selective use of transparency measures where feasible (e.g., border management dialogues, military hotlines), balanced against its strategic prudence vis‑à‑vis capabilities and regional rivalries.
6. Institutional capacity and implementation gap: The Astana meeting highlighted familiar limits — declarations versus delivery. For India, advancing commitments requires sustained diplomatic engagement, resource allocation, and selective prioritisation of initiatives that complement national objectives.

Challenges, stakeholders and prospects
Moving from Astana’s declaration to concrete outcomes confronts common regional obstacles: uneven capacities, competing great‑power interests, financing gaps and political sensitivities over sovereignty and strategic competitions. The Business Council and connectivity agenda could attract international financial institutions and private investors, but success depends on credible project pipelines and dispute‑resolution mechanisms. For India, CICA remains a useful, though modest, instrument to pursue convergence on non‑traditional security threats, deepen ties with Central Asia, and situate its policies within a wider Eurasian cooperative framework — provided New Delhi calibrates engagement to protect its strategic autonomy and developmental priorities.

Concluding observation
The Fourth CICA Ministerial in Astana exemplified the forum’s evolution from declaratory confidence‑building to tentative operationalisation — linking counter‑terrorism to UN norms, foregrounding economic connectivity, and seeking clearer institutional rules. For India, Astana offered both opportunities and constraints: it reaffirmed avenues for multilateral cooperation on issues central to Indian security, but also reiterated the perennial challenge of converting political consensus into sustained, measurable action.

### 4.x Informal Ministerial on the 25th Anniversary of CICA — A Case of Symbolic Diplomacy on UNGA Sidelines

Brief synopsis  
On 20 September 2017, an informal ministerial meeting convened on the sidelines of the 72nd session of the United Nations General Assembly to mark the 25th anniversary of the Conference on Interaction and Confidence‑Building Measures in Asia (CICA). Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister Kairat Abdrakhmanov presided over a ceremony in which Ambassador Gong Jianwei, Executive Director of the CICA Secretariat, was publicly presented with a medal. The medal was described in accompanying accounts as honoring the 25th anniversary of Kazakhstan’s diplomatic service corps — a commemoration that overlapped temporally and symbolically with the CICA milestone.

Event particulars (core facts)
- Event: Informal ministerial meeting marking CICA’s 25th anniversary.  
- Date: 20 September 2017.  
- Venue/context: Sidelines of the 72nd UN General Assembly (New York).  
- Host/actor: Kazakhstan’s Foreign Minister, Kairat Abdrakhmanov.  
- Honoree: Ambassador Gong Jianwei, Executive Director, CICA Secretariat.  
- Action: Presentation of a medal.  
- Described purpose of the medal: To honor the 25th anniversary of Kazakhstan’s diplomatic service corps (textual wording that overlaps with CICA commemorations).

Reading the ceremony: clarifications and immediate implications
- Informal ministerial: The meeting was a side/adjunct diplomatic gathering rather than a formal CICA summit or plenary. Its informality signals a focus on symbolism, networking and visibility more than hard policy decisions.  
- UNGA sidelines: By locating the event during UNGA week, organizers leveraged the presence of high‑level delegations for maximum diplomatic visibility and outreach. Such timing is a common practice for regional formats seeking to reassert relevance or enlist broader support.  
- Recognition of the Secretariat head: Publicly honoring the Executive Director highlights the Secretariat’s institutional role and raises the organization’s profile among multilateral interlocutors gathered in New York.

Context: CICA’s origins and the 25th‑anniversary milestone
- CICA background: Conceived and proposed by Kazakhstan in 1992, CICA is a multilateral framework intended to bolster interaction and confidence‑building measures among Asian states across political, military, economic and humanitarian dimensions. It represents one among several regional security architectures in Asia.  
- Significance of 25 years: Quarter‑century anniversaries are ritual moments used to review achievements, reaffirm commitments, and attempt institutional consolidation. For a relatively young regional forum like CICA, such milestones serve both retrospective and forward‑looking functions.  
- Kazakhstan’s stewardship: Kazakhstan’s initiative role and continued visible leadership — exemplified by its foreign minister’s hosting of the commemoration — underscore the country’s interest in shaping regional security discourse and preserving its legacy as the organization’s founder.  
- Role of the Secretariat: Awards to the Secretariat head can be read as recognition of the often‑understated bureaucratic labour that sustains multilateral mechanisms and as a signal intended for member states that institutional continuity is valued.

Diplomatic interpretation: meaning beyond the medal
- Symbolic diplomacy: The act performs multiple functions at once — honoring an individual, reaffirming Kazakhstan’s ownership of the CICA narrative, and conveying continuity and legitimacy to member and observer states.  
- Visibility and outreach: UNGA provides a concentrated audience of ministers and national delegations; staging the commemoration there increases the odds that the event will be noticed, discussed, and potentially resourced.  
- Institutional consolidation: Public ceremonies can help build the institutional identity of a multilateral body, encouraging staff morale and signalling to members that the Secretariat is an asset worthy of recognition.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Why India should attend to such events: India’s approach to regional security mixes selective institutional engagement with strategic autonomy. Fora like CICA — focused on confidence‑building measures (CBMs) and regional dialogue — intersect with Indian preferences for multilateral mechanisms that do not constrain core strategic choices but can offer pragmatic venues for de‑escalation, information exchange and cooperation against non‑traditional threats (terrorism, disaster management, etc.).  
- Symbolic acts and signalling: India monitors where leadership and agendas in Asian security architecture are being shaped. Kazakhstan’s visible stewardship and use of ceremonial diplomacy indicate both the limits and possibilities of CICA as a platform for agenda‑setting.  
- Institutional legitimacy vs. strategic autonomy: Recognition of the Secretariat and anniversary ritual contribute to CICA’s institutional legitimacy; India must weigh engagement with such institutions against its interest in preserving freedom of manoeuvre and prioritizing forums that deliver substantive security dividends.  
- Practical implications: Even informal ministerials on UNGA sidelines can generate useful bilateral contacts, informal understandings, and opportunities to press India’s concerns without entering binding commitments — an alignment with India’s cautious but engaged strategic culture.

Points the source does not settle (and why they matter)
- Attendance: The available account does not list which other ministers or delegations attended. Presence (or absence) of key regional actors would materially alter assessments of CICA’s contemporary traction.  
- Substantive outcomes: No communiqué or new initiative is reported in the brief account; without follow‑on documents it is difficult to gauge whether the event was purely ceremonial or accompanied by programmatic advances.  
- Wording and provenance of the medal: The medal’s description references Kazakhstan’s diplomatic service corps rather than explicitly naming CICA; this ambiguity suggests overlapping commemorations and requires confirmation from primary sources.

Recommended follow‑up research (for the scholar or policy analyst)
- Consult primary sources: Obtain Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs press release(s) and the CICA Secretariat’s statements from September 2017 to verify wording, guest lists, and any associated documents.  
- Review event scheduling: Examine the UNGA side‑event schedule and CICA event lists to determine if panels, bilateral meetings, or working‑group sessions accompanied the ministerial.  
- Map participation: Compile a list of participating states and delegations to assess regional buy‑in and to track longitudinal changes in membership engagement since CICA’s founding.  
- Assess outcomes: Search for subsequent CICA activity (workplans, projects, follow‑up meetings) to judge whether the 25th‑anniversary observance had durable institutional effects.

Concluding observation
This short, ceremonial ministerial illustrates how states use anniversaries and UNGA congestion to perform symbolic diplomacy aimed at bolstering institutional identity and visibility. For India’s strategic culture — which privileges selective multilateralism and preserves strategic autonomy — such events offer low‑cost opportunities for engagement, observation and informal diplomacy. Whether these symbolic acts translate into strengthened regional mechanisms depends on the substance that follows — an open question that requires primary source verification and participant mapping.
