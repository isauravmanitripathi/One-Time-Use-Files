## UN Women: The United Nations Programme for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women

Summary and relevance
- Entity name: United Nations Programme for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (commonly “UN Women”).
- Type: A United Nations agency and the UN’s central entity for gender equality.
- Mission: Promote gender equality and the empowerment of women across policy, programming and advocacy; defend the rights of women and girls and coordinate the UN’s gender work.
- Relevance for this book: Gender equality has become a cross-cutting variable in contemporary conceptions of human and national security. Understanding UN Women—its mandate, institutional power, and modes of engagement—helps explain international normative pressures and practical policy tools that shape India’s strategic culture and national security policymaking.

Origins and institutional evolution
- Historical antecedent: UNIFEM (the United Nations Development Fund for Women) was established in 1976 to support women’s economic and political empowerment through grant-making and pilot projects.
- Creation of UN Women: In response to critiques about fragmentation of UN gender work and to strengthen normative and operational capacity, the UN General Assembly consolidated several gender-focused entities (including UNIFEM) into a single agency. The resolution establishing the entity was adopted in 2010; UN Women became operational in 2011.
- Rationale for the merger: The consolidation sought to enhance coherence, increase visibility and political weight for gender equality within the UN system, and create a single institutional interlocutor for Member States, civil society and donors—moving from project-level support to system-wide policy guidance and coordination.

Mandate and programmatic focus
- Core mandate: Advance gender equality and the empowerment of women through policy development, normative advocacy, technical support to governments, programmatic interventions, and coordination of UN gender efforts.
- Thematic priorities:
  - Elimination of violence against women and girls (prevention, services for survivors, legal reform, data collection).
  - Economic empowerment and women’s participation in labour markets and leadership.
  - Women’s political participation and access to justice.
  - Gender-responsive disaster risk reduction, humanitarian action and recovery.
  - Contribution to Sustainable Development Goal 5 (and gender mainstreaming across the SDGs).
- Inclusive approach and contested domains: UN Women’s programming often frames gender-based violence inclusively—addressing violence affecting women and girls and, in many contexts, violence experienced by LGBT+ people. This inclusive framing expands norms but can be politically sensitive among Member States with divergent social and legal norms.

Governance, leadership and institutional posture
- Governance: An Executive Board (composed of Member State representatives with regional balance) provides oversight, approves the programme and budget, and advises on strategy and operational priorities. The Board is the primary mechanism through which Member States exercise political and financial control.
- Leadership: The Executive Director leads the agency, represents it externally, and sets strategic priorities. The inaugural Executive Director at the operational launch was Michelle Bachelet (former President of Chile), whose political stature helped raise UN Women’s visibility. As of the present institutional phase, Sima Sami Bahous (Jordanian) serves as Executive Director. High-profile leadership has been an explicit design feature to increase the agency’s diplomatic leverage and media presence.
- Institutional posture: UN Women combines normative advocacy (human rights-based language, treaty interpretations, normative guidance) with technical support (capacity-building, program design, monitoring and evaluation), positioning it between political diplomacy and development operations.

Operational model, partnerships and financing
- Presence and modalities: UN Women operates at global, regional and country levels. It partners with national governments, UN agencies, civil society organizations (especially women’s movements), and donors to deliver policy guidance, implement programs, and build local capacities.
- Coordination role: As a member of the UN Development Group (UNDG), UN Women coordinates with other UN development agencies to mainstream gender in sectoral programmes and to ensure the UN’s development assistance aligns with gender-equality objectives.
- Funding: The agency is primarily funded through voluntary contributions from Member States, multilateral funds and other donors. This voluntary financing model confers flexibility but also makes strategic priorities sensitive to donor politics and funding cycles.

Norm entrepreneurship and political constraints
- Norm diffusion: UN Women is a central actor in global norm entrepreneurship on gender equality—producing guidelines, normative frameworks and data that influence national law and policy.
- Political sensitivities: The agency’s inclusive approaches (e.g., addressing violence affecting LGBT+ persons) and its strong normative language can trigger contestation among Member States where domestic political, cultural or religious norms diverge from international prescriptions. This affects program design, country engagement strategies and diplomatic negotiations in governing fora.

Timeline (concise)
- 1976: Establishment of UNIFEM.
- 2010: UN General Assembly adopts resolution to create a consolidated entity.
- 2011: UN Women becomes operational following the merger of UNIFEM and other gender-focused UN entities.

Key institutional actors
- UN Women (central subject)
- UNIFEM (predecessor)
- Michelle Bachelet (first Executive Director at operational launch)
- Sima Sami Bahous (current Executive Director)
- UN Development Group (system-wide coordination body)

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Gender as a security variable: UN Women’s framing of gender equality as integral to development, governance and peace has implications for India’s national security calculus. Women’s safety, political and economic inclusion, and participation in security-sector institutions (police, paramilitary, armed forces) affect social resilience, counterinsurgency dynamics, and legitimacy of the state in contested regions.
- Policy alignment and domestic reform: India engages with UN normative frameworks while tailoring measures to domestic politics. Programmatic and normative inputs from UN Women reinforce reforms in areas such as legislation against gender-based violence, victim services, gender-responsive disaster management, and training curricula for security forces. India’s own policy instruments (national missions, economic empowerment programmes, and legal reforms) both respond to and shape how UN-derived norms are implemented domestically.
- Peacekeeping and international posture: India’s sizeable contributions to UN peacekeeping intersect with UN Women’s priorities (e.g., protection of civilians, women’s participation in peace processes). Training and gender advisories influence troop preparedness and India’s international image as a contributor to UN security efforts.
- Political sensitivities and domestic politics: UN Women’s inclusive approach on issues such as LGBT+ rights can be both enabling and contentious. India’s legal landscape has evolved—most notably with the decriminalisation of consensual same-sex relations in 2018—but social and political contestation remains. India’s strategic culture, which prioritises sovereignty and non-interference, shapes selective acceptance and domestication of UN gender norms.
- Strategic recommendations for policymakers (concise):
  - Integrate gender analysis into security assessments at all levels (national, regional, local) to improve threat responsiveness and societal resilience.
  - Strengthen partnerships with UN Women and civil society to build gender-sensitive capacity in law enforcement, disaster response and peacekeeping contributions.
  - Use India’s diplomatic influence to shape pragmatic UN-level approaches that reconcile normative ambition with operational feasibility in diverse cultural contexts.
  - Ensure sustainable domestic financing for gender initiatives to reduce dependence on volatile voluntary contributions and to assert national ownership of gender-security programmes.

Conclusion
UN Women occupies a distinctive position in the contemporary international architecture: it is both a norm entrepreneur and a technical actor, combining advocacy with on-the-ground programme support. For states like India, UN Women represents a source of policy tools, normative pressure and capacity-building opportunities—while also being mediated by domestic politics and strategic culture. Understanding UN Women’s structure, financing, and fields of engagement is therefore essential for situating gender within India’s evolving conceptions of national security.

## The Creation of UN Women: Origins, Structure and Strategic Implications for India

### Introduction and timeline
In early 2010 the UN Secretary-General tabled a comprehensive proposal (A/64/588, January 2010) to create a single, composite agency for gender equality and the empowerment of women. The proposal responded to General Assembly resolution 63/311 and sought to sharpen and amplify gender-equality action across the UN system rather than to displace responsibilities elsewhere. After multi-stakeholder negotiations, the General Assembly adopted resolution 64/289 on 2 July 2010, formally creating UN Women. Key subsequent milestones included the announcement of Michelle Bachelet as the first head of the agency (14 September 2010) and the appointments of John Hendra (Canada) and Lakshmi Puri (India) as the first deputy executive directors (11 March 2011). Resolution 63/311 on system-wide coherence (adopted 2 October 2010) served as the blueprint for the composite entity and requested a detailed proposal on mission, organizational arrangements, funding and governance.

Key dates
- January 2010: Report A/64/588 presented  
- 2 July 2010: General Assembly adopts resolution 64/289 creating UN Women  
- 14 September 2010: Michelle Bachelet appointed Executive Director  
- 2 October 2010: Resolution 63/311 (system-wide coherence) referenced as blueprint  
- 11 March 2011: John Hendra and Lakshmi Puri appointed deputy executive directors

### Why a composite entity? Mandate, scope and financing
The Secretary-General framed the composite agency as a mechanism to centralize leadership on gender equality across the UN, improving policy coherence, advocacy and resource mobilization. The proposal emphasized that a new agency should amplify gender-equality activities throughout the UN system rather than supplant existing mandates.

Financial estimates in the proposal were significant and instructive about expected scale:
- Approximately $125 million per year for operating and start‑up capacity across country, regional and headquarters levels.
- An additional estimated $375 million per year in an initial phase for country-level programmatic support.

These figures signalled both the ambitions of the new entity and a heavy reliance on member-state contributions and donor funding to achieve impact at scale.

### Institutional consolidation: what was merged
UN Women resulted from the merger of four existing, gender-focused UN entities, each bringing distinct strengths:
- Division for the Advancement of Women (DAW) — policy and normative work  
- International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW, est. 1976) — research and training  
- Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI, est. 1997) — system-wide advocacy and advisory functions  
- UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, est. 1976) — programmatic and grant financing

Bringing research, policy, advocacy and funding functions under one roof promised a more coherent institutional voice and easier access to combined expertise for country-level action.

### Governance, leadership and political signalling
Resolution 63/311 requested a clearly articulated mission, organizational arrangements (including an organizational chart), funding modalities and the establishment of an executive board to govern operations. The selection of high-profile leadership — Michelle Bachelet as Executive Director and the appointment of two deputy executive directors including India’s Lakshmi Puri — communicated political backing and lent legitimacy to the new agency. High-level endorsements at the opening of the 65th General Assembly reinforced the perception that UN Women was a major institutional step forward for gender equality within the UN.

### Implementation challenges and organizational dynamics
Consolidating four legacy organizations posed several practical and organisational challenges:
- Harmonizing distinct institutional cultures, staffing terms and management systems.  
- Integrating differing mandates (research, advocacy, policy, program financing) without losing specialized expertise.  
- Ensuring continuity of ongoing programmes and donor commitments during the transition.  
- Securing predictable core funding given the large initial financing estimates and dependence on voluntary contributions.

System-wide coherence also required cooperation from other UN agencies to avoid siloing responsibilities and to leverage comparative advantages across the UN system.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although UN Women is a global gender-equality institution, its creation has concrete resonances for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Political representation and influence
   - The appointment of Lakshmi Puri as a first deputy executive director signalled India’s visibility and influence in shaping international gender architecture. Such representation aligns with India’s broader multilateral strategy of active engagement in UN reforms and normative processes.

2. Gender, human security and national strategy
   - The consolidation of gender expertise at the UN strengthens normative and operational support for integrating gender into human security frameworks. For India—where strategic culture increasingly recognizes non-traditional security threats—enhanced UN capacity on gender supports policy options that treat women’s empowerment and gender equality as elements of resilience, social cohesion and stability.

3. Operational and programmatic leverage
   - The merged agency’s combination of research, policy and program funding offers Indian policymakers and practitioners a streamlined entry point for technical assistance, capacity-building and comparative research. This is relevant for domains where gender intersects with security: security sector reform, disaster response, counter‑radicalization, and community policing.

4. Diplomacy and donor/recipient dynamics
   - The financing model—large initial resource needs and reliance on voluntary contributions—creates both an expectation of donor engagement and opportunities for partnership. India’s dual role as a rising economy and recipient of technical cooperation in some areas means it can engage with UN Women both as a partner and as a contributor to programmatic initiatives aligned with India’s priorities.

5. Institutional learning and domestic reform
   - Lessons from the UN Women consolidation—on managing institutional mergers, coordinating across mandates, and building coherent governance—are relevant for Indian bureaucratic reforms seeking integration across ministries and agencies dealing with gender, development and security.

### Concluding assessment
The establishment of UN Women in 2010–2011 marked a deliberate institutional response to the need for a unified UN voice on gender equality. The consolidation sought to improve coherence, advocacy and resource mobilization, but depended on careful change-management, predictable funding and system‑wide cooperation. For India, the creation of UN Women offered diplomatic visibility, operational partnership opportunities, and normative reinforcement for integrating gender into broader conceptions of security and strategic policy-making. Integrating these global institutional shifts into India’s strategic culture demands active engagement—both in multilateral forums and in domestic policy translation—so that gender equality becomes an enduring component of national security thinking.

### UN Women: Leadership, Governance, Financing — Structure and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

This section summarizes the institutional design of UN Women and interprets its significance for Indian strategic culture and national security policy. It draws on the institutional architecture established by the General Assembly (most immediately resolution 64/289) and related intergovernmental arrangements that define leadership, governance responsibilities, board composition, and financing. Where the underlying text contained unresolved citations, I flag those items and indicate where verification is required.

1. Leadership and appointment
- UN Women is headed by an Under‑Secretary‑General (USG). The USG rank places the head among the UN’s senior leadership, conferring both political stature and managerial authority within the UN system.
- The USG is appointed by the UN Secretary‑General “in consultation with member states.” This phrasing signals a politically negotiated nomination process: the Secretary‑General has formal appointment power, but the consultation requirement entails diplomatic outreach and the need to secure buy‑in from relevant UN constituencies.
- The term of office is four years, renewable once. Term limits are intended to balance continuity with opportunities for leadership renewal.

Implication for India: the USG’s political role makes the post an arena for diplomacy. India’s ability to influence candidature or policy priorities depends on coalition building (regional group, like‑minded states) and engagement with the Secretary‑General’s office.

2. Governance architecture: normative versus operational authority
- UN Women is governed through a multi‑tiered intergovernmental framework that deliberately separates normative policy authority from operational oversight.
- Normative policy guidance — the development of global standards, norms and policy positions on gender equality and women’s rights — is set principally by the General Assembly (GA), the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), and the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). These bodies articulate the normative mandate that anchors UN Women’s legitimacy in international law and agreed UN policy.
- Operational policy guidance — the oversight of programme delivery, country support and operational modalities — is undertaken by the GA, ECOSOC and, crucially, UN Women’s Executive Board. This separation reflects the UN’s broader practice of distinguishing system‑wide normative authority from programme governance.

Implication for India: India can advance national priorities on gender and security by engaging both tracks. Normative forums such as the CSW allow India to shape global standards (e.g., on women and peace and security), while the Executive Board is where programmatic partnerships and operational modalities affecting Indian cooperation are decided.

3. The Executive Board: composition, election and regional balance
- The Executive Board comprises 41 members elected by ECOSOC for three‑year terms. Elections follow rules designed to secure geographic representation and donor participation.
- Seat allocation (as stated in the source) is: 10 African Group; 10 Asia‑Pacific Group; 4 Eastern European Group; 6 Latin America & Caribbean; 5 Western Europe & Others; and 6 “contributing countries” seats. This regional distribution is intended to reflect UN regional groupings and ensure geographic legitimacy.
- Of the six contributing‑country seats: four are drawn from among the top ten voluntary core contributors to UN Women; the remaining two are reserved for developing countries that are not members of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC), selected by the developing countries’ group from among those non‑DAC states that rank among the top ten providers of voluntary core contributions.

Verification note: the precise operationalization of the “contributing country” seats and the method for determining the relevant “top ten” contributors should be checked against the Executive Board rules of procedure and ECOSOC decisions (the source text included [citation needed] flags on some of these specifics).

Implication for India: as a member of the Asia‑Pacific group, India competes for a regional seat; India is not a DAC member and has in recent years increased South–South cooperation. If India were among the top non‑DAC voluntary core contributors to UN Women, it could qualify for a contributing‑country seat under the rules described — an avenue for amplified operational influence. Practically, the donor‑weighted seats institutionalize a channel through which financial contributors can shape operational priorities, a dynamic New Delhi must manage in aligning external funding with national strategic aims.

4. Financing: bifurcation of normative and operational funding
- Normative processes (policy development, standards setting, normative activities) are financed from the UN regular budget. Such allocations require General Assembly approval and therefore have a different predictability and accountability logic than voluntary funding.
- Service and operational activities (programme delivery, country‑level operations, technical assistance) are funded primarily through voluntary contributions (multi‑donor trust funds, bilateral/unearmarked contributions). Operational budgets, which depend on these voluntary resources, are approved by UN Women’s Executive Board.
- Practical consequence: the separation means that while UN Women’s normative voice is supported by the more predictable regular budget, programme work is vulnerable to the timing, earmarks and preferences of voluntary donors. Reliance on voluntary contributions can reduce predictability and can promote donor‑driven programming.

Implication for India: from a policy perspective, India can use voluntary funding and bilateral partnerships to align UN Women programme work with its national priorities (for example, in counter‑insurgency stabilization, police reform, or community resilience where gender intersects with security). However, India must be aware that donor conditionality and earmarking can shape operational agendas in ways that may or may not coincide with India’s strategic aims.

5. Strategic and normative consequences for India’s national security policy
- Institutional leverage: engagement with both the CSW (normative) and the Executive Board (operational) enables India to influence global norms on women, peace and security as well as the design of country‑level programmes that intersect with security sector reform, counterterrorism, or disaster response.
- Political bargaining: the appointment process for the USG and the need to secure seats on the Executive Board implicate classic diplomatic bargaining. For a rising power with a tradition of strategic autonomy, participation in these processes is an instrument of soft power — shaping norms while protecting policy space.
- Operational cooperation and predictability: because operational work is donor‑funded, India’s partnerships with UN Women will typically be projectized and negotiated. For national security‑relevant projects (e.g., gender training for security forces, reintegration of women in conflict zones), this affects program design, timelines and sustainability.
- Norm diffusion and domestic policy: UN normative outputs (CSW outcomes, GA/ECOSOC resolutions) serve as reference points in India’s internal debates over gender in security institutions. India’s engagement with these norms contributes to its strategic culture by opening avenues for institutional reforms (police, military medical and psychosocial services) and by influencing civil‑military relations around gendered security issues.

6. Sources, gaps and recommendations for verification
- The principal founding text is UN General Assembly resolution 64/289 (2010), which created UN Women; that resolution should be consulted for the core legal/organizational provisions.
- Executive Board composition and election procedures are governed by ECOSOC decisions and the Executive Board’s own rules of procedure; those documents should be reviewed to confirm the exact mechanics of the “contributing country” seats and the donor ranking methodology alluded to above.
- The source from which these points were abstracted contained multiple “[citation needed]” flags; wherever precise procedural claims are operationally consequential (for example, the selection method for the two non‑DAC contributing seats), cite the Executive Board rules or ECOSOC election decisions before using those claims in formal analysis.

Concluding remark
UN Women’s institutional design — a USG leadership post, a split between normative and operational authority, a regionally apportioned but donor‑sensitive Executive Board, and a bifurcated financing model — creates both opportunities and constraints for states seeking to advance gendered aspects of security policy. For India, effective engagement requires diplomacy across normative fora (GA/ECOSOC/CSW), strategic use of programmatic partnerships financed through voluntary channels, and careful management of donor dynamics so that operational cooperation reinforces, rather than distorts, India’s national security and strategic objectives.

## The Executive Board of UN Women

The Executive Board of UN Women is the principal intergovernmental organ charged with oversight, policy guidance and approval of programmes and budgets. As such it sits at the interface between member-state priorities and the operational work of the organization — a governance mechanism through which states shape how global gender equality and women’s empowerment are translated into concrete programmes, normative guidance and resource allocations. For states with strategic ambitions — including India — engagement with the Executive Board is therefore a means to influence international norms and to align multilateral action on gender with national security and strategic objectives (for example, through women, peace and security frameworks).

A short caption that appears in many institutional records — “The IWD 2014 parade” — serves as a reminder: UN Women’s work combines symbolic public diplomacy (commemorative events, advocacy) with administrative governance (the Executive Board’s policy and budget decisions). Both dimensions matter to states seeking to project normative leadership or to secure programme resources that dovetail with domestic priorities.

Leadership and administration
- As of 2023, Jordanian diplomat Sima Sami Bahous serves as Executive Director of UN Women. The Executive Director is the senior official charged with implementing the Board’s decisions, managing the secretariat and representing the organization to member states and other partners. The Executive Director’s stewardship therefore mediates how Board guidance is operationalized on the ground.

Membership and regional composition (2020)
Membership of the Executive Board is organized by UN regional groups; seats rotate and the precise composition changes with elections and term limits. The list below records the Board membership for 2020 and illustrates the regional balance typical of UN governance practices:

- Africa: Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco, Nigeria, Sierra Leone
- Asia-Pacific: Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Mongolia, Nepal, Republic of Korea, Saudi Arabia
- Eastern Europe: Georgia, Hungary, Lithuania, Russia
- Latin America & the Caribbean: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico
- Western Europe & Others: Belgium, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, Switzerland
- Contributing countries (identified separately): Finland, Senegal, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States

Interpretation and implications
- Regional balance and rotating seats: The Board’s structure mirrors standard UN practice to ensure geographic representation. This matters substantively because regional groupings influence agenda-setting, the selection of priorities and the coalition-building that determines funding allocations and programme emphases.
- “Contributing countries”: When donor states are listed separately or highlighted, it often denotes a combination of financial leverage and informal influence. Large or consistent donors (e.g., Sweden, United Kingdom, United States) can shape programming priorities through earmarked funds, policy dialogue and bilateral diplomacy with the Executive Director and Board members.
- Dynamic composition: Because membership rotates, states must treat any static list (such as the 2020 roster) as a historical snapshot. For contemporary analysis or policy engagement, verification of the current Board composition is essential.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
India appears on the 2020 Asia-Pacific list, reflecting its active participation in multilateral governance on gender issues. For Indian strategic culture — which prizes a mix of normative leadership, diplomatic engagement and pragmatic interest-protection — the Executive Board offers several avenues of utility:
- Norm entrepreneurship: Through Board membership India can shape global norms on women’s participation in security, peacekeeping and disaster response — areas that tie directly to national security policy and to India’s contributions to UN peace operations.
- Programmatic leverage: Influence on budgetary and programme allocations enables India to direct or advocate for UN Women interventions that align with domestic priorities (capacity-building for women police, support for women veterans, economic empowerment initiatives in border regions).
- Diplomatic signalling: Visible participation demonstrates India’s commitment to global gender agendas, which can be instrumental in coalition-building within the Global South and in bilateral relations with donor countries.
- Mainstreaming gender into security policy: Board engagement complements India’s internal efforts to integrate gender perspectives into defence, diplomacy and development — reinforcing UNSCR 1325-type objectives and contributing to the legitimacy of India’s security posture.

Practical note for policymakers and scholars
- Verify current membership: Because Board composition changes, practitioners should consult the latest UN Women records before planning diplomatic or programmatic engagement.
- Leverage both governance and donor channels: Influence derives from formal Board work, bilateral donor relationships and engagement with the Executive Director’s office. Strategic engagement should coordinate across these channels.
- Link normative and material interests: For states seeking to link gender equality to national security, the Executive Board is most useful when normative advocacy is paired with concrete proposals for programming and funding that address women’s security, participation in peace processes and resilience in conflict-affected areas.

In short, the Executive Board is not merely an administrative organ; it is a site where geopolitical interests, normative commitments and resource politics intersect. For India’s strategic culture, continued engagement with the Board offers a pragmatic pathway to shape international gender agendas while reinforcing national security objectives that depend on women’s participation, protection and empowerment.

## UN Women — Mandate

UN Women was created by General Assembly resolution 64/289 (2010) as a single, consolidated entity to strengthen the United Nations’ ability to advance gender equality and the empowerment of women. Its formation merged the mandates and functions of four earlier bodies—(1) the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, (2) the Division for the Advancement of Women, (3) the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), and (4) the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW)—into an organisation with three complementary core roles: normative leadership, operational programme delivery, and system-wide coordination and accountability on gender issues.

Photographic caption (illustrative): UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo‑Ngcuka speaking at the Girl Summit, 2014 — emblematic of the office’s visible leadership and public advocacy role.

### System-wide leadership, coordination and the limits of replacement
UN Women is mandated to lead, coordinate and promote accountability for gender equality across the UN system. Its role is explicitly catalytic: it must enhance and harmonize the gender work of other UN agencies rather than supplant them. Sectoral agencies—UNICEF in child and maternal health, UNDP in development, UNFPA on reproductive health and population—retain primary responsibility within their technical fields; UN Women provides the gender expertise, policy coherence and accountability mechanisms necessary to mainstream gender across those sectoral programmes.

The entity operates within the legal and normative architecture of the UN: the UN Charter, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (including Beijing’s 12 critical areas of concern), the outcome of the 23rd Special Session of the General Assembly, and subsequent relevant resolutions and international instruments. These frameworks guide UN Women’s normative work and its monitoring of progress by Member States.

### Thematic priorities and programmatic scope
UN Women’s mandate encompasses a set of core thematic and practical priorities that bridge development, human rights, humanitarian response and peace and security:

- Leadership and political participation — promoting women’s representation in elected office, public administration and leadership positions.
- Economic empowerment — programmes and policy advice to expand women’s labour-market participation, access to assets, social protection and entrepreneurship.
- Ending violence against women — prevention, survivor services, legal reform and criminal justice responses.
- Humanitarian action — gender‑sensitive preparedness, response and recovery in crises and displacement contexts.
- Peace and security — advancing implementation of UN Security Council resolutions (including 1325 and follow‑ups) on women, peace and security and supporting women’s meaningful participation in peace processes.
- Governance and national planning — integrating gender into national plans, budgets and institutional mechanisms.
- Health issues, including HIV and AIDS — gendered responses to epidemics and health service delivery.

These thematic areas are pursued via country-level programmes, regional initiatives and global policy work. UN Women also produces flagship analytical work—such as the Progress of the World’s Women series—that informs policy, negotiation and advocacy.

### Tools, campaigns and practical instruments
UN Women combines normative guidance with operational tools and public-facing campaigns:

- Constitutional and legal tools: in late 2013 UN Women launched the first constitutional database analysed through a gender lens. The database maps constitutional provisions that guarantee, deny or protect the rights of women and girls; it groups provisions into 16 categories, is searchable, and is updated annually. This is a practical resource for legal reform advocates, researchers and policy‑makers seeking comparative evidence to support legal change.
- Public advocacy and norm-shaping campaigns: UN Women has adopted creative communications strategies to surface societal norms and discrimination. In 2013 it ran an ad campaign that used genuine Google autocomplete suggestions—many sexist or misogynist—as imagery to highlight the prevalence of gender bias. Parallel campaigns advanced LGBTIQ rights and demonstrated a commitment to intersectional approaches. These media strategies combine empirical research with visual rhetoric to influence public opinion and policy debate.
- Intersectional feminism: UN Women explicitly promotes an intersectional approach, recognising that gender discrimination intersects with race, class, disability, sexual orientation and other forms of exclusion. Practically, this requires disaggregated data, tailored interventions and attention to groups that are multiply marginalised.

### Global processes, convening role and major milestones
UN Women convenes and supports major global processes concerned with gender equality. It is a lead agency in coordinating International Women’s Day activities and services the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). A watershed moment came in 2015: the 20th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women and the Beijing Platform for Action, marked by CSW59’s review of progress and remaining gaps. In the same year, UN Women played an active role in intergovernmental negotiations across key fora—from the Financing for Development conference in Addis Ababa (advocating predictable funding for gender equality) to the adoption of the post‑2015 development agenda. These efforts contributed to the inclusion of a standalone Sustainable Development Goal on gender equality (SDG 5) and to mainstreaming gender across the entire 2030 Agenda.

### Institutional form, resources and implementation challenges
UN Women’s headquarters are in New York, with regional and country offices deployed to support implementation, technical assistance and partnerships. Its budget is built primarily on voluntary contributions from Member States and other donors. While flexible funding allows programme responsiveness, reliance on voluntary contributions generates predictability and scale challenges: funding shortfalls constrain programme reach and long‑term planning.

Key implementation challenges include:
- Translating normative gains into domestic legal and policy change—constitutional or statutory advances do not automatically result in effective implementation or social transformation.
- Navigating political resistance—especially on contentious issues such as LGBTIQ rights or gendered aspects of sexual and reproductive health—requires diplomatic skill and can limit consensus in intergovernmental settings.
- Ensuring system-wide accountability—monitoring gender mainstreaming across disparate UN agencies remains an ongoing task, requiring both technical guidance and institutional incentives.
- Maintaining predictable financing for sustained country engagement and capacity‑building.

### Relevance for national strategic cultures and for India
UN Women’s mandate intersects with national security and strategic culture in several important ways. Gender equality is not only a human‑rights imperative; it is a component of social resilience, conflict prevention, stabilisation and effective governance. Women’s participation in political life, equitable economic opportunities and the eradication of gender‑based violence contribute to societal stability and state legitimacy—issues central to national security policy.

For India, engagement with UN Women offers tactical and normative tools that can inform national policy:
- The constitutional database and comparative legal analyses can support Indian legal reformers and civil‑society actors seeking to strengthen gender‑sensitive provisions or to benchmark India’s laws against international practice.
- UN Women’s expertise on gender in humanitarian response and peacebuilding is relevant to India’s disaster management and to its roles in regional stability and UN peace operations.
- Intersectional approaches highlight the need to account for caste, class, religion, and disability within gender policy—an imperative for Indian planners aiming at inclusive resilience and social cohesion.
- India’s evolving stance on LGBTIQ rights (including domestic legal developments) means UN Women’s advocacy and technical resources can be politically useful but also diplomatically sensitive, given diverse Member State positions.
- Participation in global negotiations (CSW, SDG processes, Financing for Development) enables India to shape the international gender agenda while aligning domestic commitments—SDG 5 and gender mainstreaming across the SDGs provide frameworks that intersect with India’s developmental and security objectives.

In practice, leveraging UN Women’s normative instruments, data and programme support requires persistent domestic investment: predictable financing, cross‑sectoral coordination, capacity building within ministries (defence, home affairs, health, finance), and partnerships with civil society. For a strategic culture that seeks comprehensive security, integrating gendered analysis into national security policy strengthens both legitimacy and effectiveness.

Conclusion: UN Women’s mandate—rooted in consolidation, normative leadership, operational engagement and system coordination—connects directly to the global development architecture (notably SDG 5) and provides practical instruments and advocacy platforms that Member States, including India, can use to advance gender equality as a pillar of sustainable development and security.

## UN Women — Goals (Section: Goals)

Opening statement
- UN Women is empowered to: shape global norms on gender equality, support the translation of those norms into national practice, and enable member states to hold the UN system itself accountable for delivering on gender-equality commitments.

Mandate and core functions
- Norm‑setting and policy guidance. UN Women serves as the UN system’s normative hub on gender equality, providing technical input and expert synthesis to intergovernmental bodies—most prominently the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). Through this role it helps frame international standards and interpretive guidance rooted in instruments such as CEDAW and the Beijing Platform for Action.
- Implementation support and capacity‑building. Beyond norm development, UN Women assists member states to operationalize those standards: offering policy advice, legal and institutional reform support, training, pilot programmes, and project design to integrate gender perspectives into national laws, budgets and public programmes.
- System‑wide accountability and oversight. UN Women equips member states to monitor and demand accountability from the UN system itself. This includes consolidating system‑wide reporting, supporting gender audits and reviews, and promoting common performance frameworks so that all UN entities measure and report progress on gender equality.

Ideas that underlie these goals
- Norm‑setting: UN Women centralizes expertise so that global standards for women’s rights are coherent, evidence‑based and visible across UN processes.
- Implementation bridging: The organization acts as a translator between international norms and domestic realities—providing the technical assistance necessary to convert commitments into laws, policies and programmes.
- Accountability mechanism: By collating data, facilitating reporting cycles and promoting system‑wide tools, UN Women strengthens the capacity of states and civil society to assess UN performance on gender commitments.
- Whole‑of‑system approach: Recognizing that gender equality requires action by both states and the UN system, UN Women works internally (across UN agencies) and externally (with governments and partners) to mainstream gender across policy and programming.

Operational modalities (how UN Women works)
- Support to intergovernmental processes: preparing policy briefs and technical papers for CSW and other UN fora, and participating in negotiations to shape global standards.
- Country‑level action: advising ministries, drafting model legislation, delivering training for public servants, piloting scalable programmes, and building institutional capacities (e.g., national gender machinery).
- Monitoring and reporting: compiling indicators and progress reports, facilitating gender audits and contributing to system‑wide accountability frameworks that allow comparative assessment of UN entities’ performance.

Relevant instruments and bodies
- Commission on the Status of Women (CSW): principal intergovernmental body where global priorities and normative standards are debated and advanced.
- International instruments: notably the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the Beijing Platform for Action, which provide the legal and policy foundations UN Women promotes and helps implement.
- System‑wide frameworks: UN‑level mechanisms and performance frameworks that standardize how gender equality is measured and reported across agencies.

Challenges and limits
- Political will and domestic variability: Member‑state commitment to gender standards is uneven; some states resist certain norms or lack political consensus for reforms.
- Resource constraints: UN Women’s capacity to provide technical assistance and to monitor system‑wide compliance depends on predictable funding and staffing.
- Institutional complexity: Translating norms into national practice is complicated by differing governance capacities, legal pluralism, and competing policy priorities within states.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Gender equality as a component of human and national security: For strategic planners, the goals UN Women advances are relevant because women’s rights and participation intersect with societal resilience, stability, crisis response and counter‑radicalization efforts. Policy coherence that integrates gender strengthens social cohesion and broadens national security approaches beyond narrow military metrics.
- Practical engagement: India’s engagement with UN Women’s agenda—through participation in CSW, use of UN technical assistance, and alignment of domestic reforms with international norms—can reinforce legal and institutional reforms (criminal law, domestic violence protections, economic empowerment programmes) that have downstream security benefits.
- Accountability leverage: India can both draw on and contribute to system‑wide accountability mechanisms to ensure UN support in India is effective, while also using UN reporting and benchmarks to drive domestic policy improvements.

Conclusion
UN Women’s goals—norm‑setting, implementation support, and system‑wide accountability—constitute a coherent strategy to move international gender commitments from declaratory standards to national practice. For states like India, these goals have clear strategic salience: aligning national policy with global standards and leveraging UN technical and accountability tools can advance both gender justice and broader objectives of social stability and national security.

### Case study: The UN Women controversy after 7 October 2023 — implications for multilateral credibility and India’s strategic posture

This short case study examines the public controversy over UN Women’s messaging and response to the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, and draws out institutional, legal and political lessons relevant to states’ strategic calculations — including India’s approach to multilateral engagement, institutional credibility and national security policy.

Summary of events and public criticism
- On 7 October 2023 Hamas carried out a major attack on Israel; the incident prompted intense international scrutiny of how UN entities and other international organizations responded.
- Critics, especially women’s rights groups, argued that UN Women failed to timely and clearly condemn gender‑based war crimes committed against Israeli women and girls.
- Sarah Weiss Maudi (senior adviser to the President of the 77th UN General Assembly) publicly accused UN Women of refusing to acknowledge atrocities against Israeli women and girls despite circulating video evidence.
- UN Women issued an initial statement on 13 October condemning the attack on Israeli civilians, but the statement did not explicitly single out violence against women.
- Subsequent UN Women messaging was perceived by some observers as focusing largely on the humanitarian impact on Palestinian women, with critics saying Israeli victims were not similarly acknowledged.
- A month after the attack UN Women’s website reportedly contained only a single reference to “the devastating impact of the crisis in Gaza on women and girls,” which critics cited as evidence of an asymmetrical public posture.
- High‑profile criticisms included public statements by Michal Herzog, Israel’s First Lady, and commentary from women’s organizations and legal‑policy observers such as Anne Bayefsky.
- On 29 November over 80 U.S. Representatives (a bipartisan group led by Reps. Young Kim and Sheila Cherfilus‑McCormick) sent a letter to UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous accusing the agency of disregarding Hamas’s gender‑based violence against Israeli females and minors and warning that such omissions undermine the organization’s mandate.
- Israel’s UN ambassador criticized both UN Women and UN Secretary‑General António Guterres for delays in calling for an investigation into sexual violence committed on 7 October.
- A public protest related to these complaints took place at the United Nations on 4 December 2023.

UN Women’s response and communications dynamics
- UN Women has defended its record, stating that it was among the first UN entities to condemn the Hamas attacks and the use of gender‑based violence.
- The agency attributed a deleted social media post that explicitly condemned Hamas to “social media mistakes” occurring during a busy campaign period (e.g., the 16 Days of Activism), a communications explanation that itself became part of the controversy.
- The tensions highlight how the content, timing and channels of messaging — from formal press releases to social media posts — shape public perceptions of institutional neutrality and moral clarity.

Legal and normative context
- UN Women’s core mandate is the promotion of gender equality and the prevention of violence against women; perceived silence or asymmetry in responding to sexual violence in conflict damages the organization’s normative authority.
- Sexual violence in armed conflict can constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity under international law; calls for impartial investigations and accountability are consistent with established legal norms.
- Independent verification and transparent reporting are essential to the legitimacy of any allegation of gender‑based crimes in conflict.

Political factors shaping UN agency responses
- Responses by UN agencies do not occur in a political vacuum: member‑state sensitivities, diplomatic pressure, operational constraints and the need to preserve access to humanitarian operations often influence public communications.
- High‑profile actors — first ladies, members of national legislatures, ambassadors and influential NGOs — can rapidly escalate reputational and accountability pressures on international organizations.
- Social media errors or campaign timing (e.g., overlap with major advocacy periods) can amplify perceptions of bias and create lasting reputational harm even when procedural explanations are offered.

Institutional risk and practical corrective measures
- Perceived “double standards” threaten donor confidence and stakeholder trust in UN Women’s impartiality and can have practical consequences for funding and cooperation.
- Commonly recommended practical steps for UN agencies in such incidents include: issuing explicit condemnations of gender‑based crimes; publicly calling for independent and impartial investigations; prioritizing and expanding survivor services; and ensuring balanced, timely public communications that acknowledge all victims.
- Monitoring, independent verification and prompt, transparent reporting are vital to restoring credibility.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s strategic culture emphasizes respect for multilateral institutions coupled with pragmatic concern about institutional effectiveness and impartiality. Incidents that erode the perceived neutrality of international organizations shape New Delhi’s calculations about engagement, burden‑sharing and normative leadership.
- Policy consequences for India may include:
  - Diplomatic posture: India may be more inclined to press for clear, rules‑based responses from UN bodies and to support mechanisms for impartial investigation and accountability in cases of sexual violence.
  - Multilateral engagement: While continuing to value UN frameworks (peacekeeping, humanitarian coordination), India could use such controversies to advocate procedural reforms (greater transparency, standardized crisis‑communication protocols) that reduce politicization.
  - Domestic and normative messaging: Episodes of perceived institutional bias abroad can strengthen domestic arguments for robust, independent mechanisms to investigate sexual violence and may influence India’s public diplomacy on norms related to gender and security.
  - Operational choices: In peace operations and humanitarian responses, India may place a premium on verification, survivor‑centred assistance, and clear public reporting to avoid association with contested narratives.
- For India, safeguarding its strategic interests involves balancing principled support for multilateral law (including rules against wartime sexual violence) with pragmatic demands for credible, impartial international institutions.

Conclusion — lessons for practitioners and policymakers
- The UN Women episode underscores that timely, explicit, and balanced communications are not peripheral but central to institutional legitimacy in crises involving gender‑based violence.
- For states like India that rely on multilateral institutions for security, humanitarian and normative purposes, such controversies highlight the importance of:
  - pushing for independent verification mechanisms;
  - insisting on transparent standards for public communications during crises; and
  - linking normative commitments (to gender equality and the prohibition of sexual violence) to concrete accountability processes.
- Ultimately, the event illuminates how reputational dynamics within international organizations can have measurable effects on state behaviour, donor confidence and the broader architecture of multilateral governance — matters of direct relevance to any serious study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy.
