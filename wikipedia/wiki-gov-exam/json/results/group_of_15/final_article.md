## Introduction — The Group of 15 (G‑15)

The Group of 15 (G‑15) is an instructive example of post‑Cold War multilateralism among developing states: an informal, multi‑regional forum created to deepen South–South cooperation and to amplify the collective voice of developing countries within larger global economic fora. Its genesis, composition, aims and operational character illuminate both the opportunities and limits such groupings present for states—India among them—that pursue strategic autonomy through economic diplomacy.

Origins and stated purpose
- The G‑15 was launched at the Ninth Non‑Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit in Belgrade in September 1989. Its creation reflected a felt need among a subset of developing countries for closer coordination on economic policy and greater influence in the institutions and discussions dominated by developed economies.
- The forum’s principal purpose is to foster cooperation among member states in areas of shared interest—primarily investment, trade and technology—and to provide coordinated input into larger international economic debates, notably at venues such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and in interactions with the Group of Seven (G7).
- As an extension of NAM-era solidarity and later South–South cooperation, the G‑15 is explicitly oriented toward promoting “enhanced growth and prosperity for developing countries” through cooperative policy stances and technical collaboration rather than legally binding commitments.

Membership and evolution
- The membership was drawn from three regions—Latin America, Africa and Asia—positioning the G‑15 squarely within the network of Global South cooperation mechanisms. This cross‑regional composition is a deliberate feature: it seeks to present a united, geographically diverse front in global economic fora.
- Membership has evolved since 1989. After the founding, Chile, Iran and Kenya joined; Yugoslavia (a founder) is no longer a member; and Peru, although a founding participant, left the group in 2011. Although the number of participants expanded to 17, the group retained the historic designation “G‑15”—a common practice among international coalitions that value brand recognition and continuity.
- The G‑15’s membership dynamics underline a hybrid character: stable in purpose but flexible in composition, reflecting shifting national priorities and political alignments among developing states.

Functioning, activities and instruments of influence
- Informality defines the G‑15’s operational logic. It typically issues joint communiqués, policy recommendations and declarations following summit meetings and ministerial gatherings. It also undertakes technical cooperation projects and seeks to coordinate positions in multilateral negotiations.
- The forum’s outputs are generally non‑binding; the G‑15 can recommend and coordinate, but it cannot enforce compliance. Its influence thus rests on consensus building, the reputation and diplomatic reach of members, and the ability to translate coordinated positions into persuasive interventions within larger institutions (for example, forming part of broader coalitions in WTO negotiations).
- Typical activities include periodic summits of heads of state or government, ministerial meetings (trade, finance, science and technology), and working groups that pursue concrete cooperation in investment, technology transfer and capacity building.

Strategic relevance for India
- India has been an active participant in the G‑15 since its founding. For Indian strategic culture—which prizes strategic autonomy, economic engagement and coalition diplomacy—the G‑15 offers a low‑cost, politically congenial venue to pursue several objectives:
  - Economic diplomacy: coordination on trade and investment issues allows India to advance positions that safeguard its development space while seeking technology and investment partnerships.
  - Coalition building: the G‑15 provides an additional layer of South–South alignment that India can use to complement its bilateral ties and its roles in other groupings (e.g., BRICS, G‑20, NAM).
  - Soft power and normative influence: participation underscores India’s credentials as a leader among developing countries and supports narratives of inclusive development and multilateral reform.
- At the same time, India’s capacity to translate G‑15 pronouncements into materially consequential outcomes depends on its bilateral leverage, the coherence of member positions, and willingness to coordinate with larger coalitions in trade and finance negotiations.

Limits and determinants of effectiveness
- The G‑15’s informality is both an asset and a constraint. It facilitates flexible coordination and consensual diplomacy but limits the forum’s ability to secure enforceable commitments or to directly alter institutional rules in bodies such as the WTO.
- Effectiveness hinges on three factors: (1) the political will of members to align and act collectively; (2) the clarity and technical rigor of the group’s policy proposals; and (3) the capacity to forge broader alliances when engaging with powerful states or institutional rule‑makers (for example, the G‑15 contributing to wider developing‑country blocs).
- Consequently, the G‑15 is best understood as a platform for agenda‑setting, policy harmonization and technical cooperation rather than as a treaty‑making or regulatory body.

Concise synthesis
The G‑15 is a multi‑regional, informal forum established in 1989 to enhance cooperation among developing countries on investment, trade and technology and to amplify their voice in larger international economic discussions. Its membership has changed over time (now numbering 17 despite the historic label “G‑15”), and its mode of operation—summits, communiqués, working groups—reflects an emphasis on non‑binding coordination. For India, the G‑15 complements broader strands of strategic culture by enabling economic diplomacy, coalition building and South–South engagement, even as the group’s informal nature constrains the direct, enforceable impact of its recommendations.

## The G-15: Objectives, Institutional Design, and Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture

The Group of 15 (G‑15) is a pragmatic, policy‑oriented coalition of developing countries that seeks to strengthen South–South cooperation while engaging constructively with industrialized states. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the G‑15 is a revealing case of how India pursues multilateral engagement through flexible, low‑cost architectures that emphasize coordination, technical cooperation and the mobilization of non‑state actors. The following section synthesizes the G‑15’s aims, organs and working practices and draws out implications for Indian strategy.

### Core objectives

The G‑15’s declared objectives emphasize collective agency among developing countries and a balanced approach to interaction with developed states:

- Harness the potential for greater and mutually beneficial cooperation among developing countries — economic, technical and political.
- Regularly review how global developments and evolving international economic relations affect developing states.
- Serve as a forum for consultation among developing countries to coordinate policies and, where appropriate, joint actions.
- Identify and operationalize new, concrete schemes of South–South cooperation and mobilize broader support for them.
- Promote a more positive and productive North–South dialogue, seeking cooperative and constructive solutions to shared problems.

Analytically, these goals reflect two central impulses in Indian strategic practice: building autonomous leverage through coalitions of the Global South, and using multilateral fora to shape the agenda of North–South negotiations on trade, finance and development.

### Institutional design: minimal bureaucracy, targeted support

The G‑15 was deliberately designed to avoid the heavy, permanent bureaucracies characteristic of formal international institutions (e.g., UN agencies, major financial institutions). This minimalist institutional choice has several practical consequences:

- Lower administrative costs and greater flexibility in agenda setting and delegation.
- Dependence on rotating political leadership and on members’ own capacity to follow up decisions.
- Potential weakness in institutional memory and in long‑term implementation capacity.

To mitigate some of these limitations, the G‑15 maintains a small Technical Support Facility (TSF) based in Geneva. The TSF operates under the direction of the acting Chair for the year and provides essential support services — research, secretariat functions, and liaison with the many international organizations headquartered in Geneva (UN agencies, WTO, UNCTAD, etc.). For India, the TSF is important because it situates the G‑15’s modest technical capacity within the global institutional hub, facilitating sustained engagement on trade and development issues that are central to national economic security.

### Principal organs and meeting cycle

The G‑15’s working methods combine periodic high‑level political visibility with more regular technical and ministerial coordination:

- Biennial summits of heads of state and government: the summit is the principal political event; the venue rotates among the three developing regions represented in the membership. These summits provide visibility and political impetus for collective statements and initiatives.
- Annual meetings of Ministers of Foreign Affairs: these ministerial meetings coordinate the group’s agenda between summits and prepare substantive dossiers for leaders.
- Troika (steering committee): composed of the foreign ministers of the previous, current and next summit host countries. The Troika provides continuity and oversight across rotating leaderships — a vital stabilizer in an organization without a large permanent secretariat.
- Personal representatives of heads of state and government: each member nominates a personal representative who meets regularly in Geneva. These envoys sustain day‑to‑day coordination and maintain engagement with the TSF and Geneva‑based international organizations.
- Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Services (FCCIS): a private‑sector forum among G‑15 members intended to translate policy dialogue into business cooperation, joint investment and trade promotion.

This mixed rhythm — biennial political summits balanced by annual ministerial and regular expert/representative meetings — is designed to preserve both political salience and practical follow‑through.

### Strengths and constraints (analytic assessment)

Strengths
- Flexibility and low cost: the G‑15’s minimal bureaucracy allows quick adaptation and lower political frictions.
- South–South focus: it provides a collective platform for developing states to coordinate positions and mobilize technical cooperation.
- Geneva presence: the TSF and regular meetings of personal representatives ensure effective linkages with global rule‑making bodies, amplifying members’ influence in trade and development deliberations.
- Private‑sector linkage: the FCCIS gives the group an avenue to convert political commitments into economic activity.

Constraints
- Limited implementation capacity: without a substantial secretariat, follow‑through on initiatives depends heavily on chairmanship energy and member commitment.
- Institutional memory risk: rotating chairs and a small technical staff can weaken continuity over longer initiative cycles.
- Variable member priorities: heterogeneous membership can complicate consensus on politically sensitive North–South bargaining positions.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

The G‑15 exemplifies several features of Indian strategy in the international system:

- Coalition practice over institutional entrenchment: India prefers flexible coalitions that allow issue‑based leadership and selective institutional commitments rather than extensive, costly bureaucracies.
- Instrumental South–South diplomacy: India uses forums like the G‑15 to advance trade, technology transfer and development cooperation objectives that contribute to economic resilience — a core component of national security.
- Geneva‑centred technical engagement: sustaining a presence through personal representatives and the TSF aligns with India’s emphasis on technical diplomacy at multilateral rule‑making venues (WTO, UNCTAD) that affect its economic and security interests.
- Leveraging private sector partnerships: FCCIS‑type mechanisms are congruent with India’s increasing reliance on private investment and industry as elements of strategic autonomy.

Operational recommendations for Indian policymakers (brief)
- Use the TSF and personal representative channel to anchor continuity in priority dossiers (e.g., trade remedies, technology cooperation).
- Leverage the FCCIS to pilot concrete South–South investment and supply‑chain projects that serve economic security objectives.
- Promote stronger Troika practices (clear workplans, intersessional deliverables) to offset the G‑15’s limited permanent capacity.

### Key terms
- G‑15
- South–South cooperation
- North–South dialogue
- Technical Support Facility (TSF)
- Troika
- FCCIS (Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Services)
- Biennial summit
- Personal representatives

Historical note: Following the 14th summit in Tehran, Sri Lanka accepted the G‑15 chairmanship in 2010 — an illustration of the organization’s normal practice of rotating political leadership among members while relying on Geneva‑based technical continuity.

This compact institutional form and operational rhythm make the G‑15 a useful instrument for India’s strategic objectives: it amplifies South–South diplomatic weight, provides targeted technical engagement in key global fora, and offers a pathway to mobilize private‑sector resources — all while preserving the flexibility prized in India’s multilateral practice.

Data quality, inconsistencies and methodological caveats
- Membership count mismatch: Although labelled “Group of 15,” the table lists 17 countries (6 Africa + 5 Asia + 6 LAC). Clarify whether this is an expanded grouping, a drafting error, or a different coalition.
- Source mixing: The table attributes macroeconomic figures to the World Bank (2023) while political officeholders (heads of state/government and foreign ministers) are ordinarily derived from political‑affairs or government registries. Combining these without explicit provenance risks temporal mismatch and source inconsistency.
- Formatting risks: Visible misalignment of headers and columns can produce shifted values or mislabeled fields; automated ingestion must check column integrity.
- Numerical inconsistencies: Some GDP per‑capita entries are arithmetically inconsistent with the stated GDP (PPP) and population (e.g., Indonesia, Mexico). This suggests unit mismatches (billions vs. millions), rounding issues, or transcription errors.
- PPP clarity absent: The PPP series lacks a stated base year and currency reference (constant dollars? international dollars?). PPP base year critically affects cross‑country comparability and trend interpretation.
- Timeliness and politicodynamics: Political officeholders change frequently. Without timestamps, the diplomatic/personnel data cannot reliably inform current policy analysis.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic weighting and alliance mapping: Clean, comparable GDP (PPP) and population data are essential for estimating other states’ material capacity — crucial when India evaluates potential partners in the Global South, defence cooperation, or economic diplomacy.
- Diplomatic outreach and representation: Accurate identification of foreign ministers and heads of government enables targeted diplomatic initiatives (summits, state visits, Track 1.5/2 dialogues). Mistakes in personnel data can lead to embarrassment or missed opportunities.
- Narrative and soft‑power calibration: Per‑capita welfare indicators inform India’s messaging on development partnerships (e.g., technology transfer, capacity building) and frame India’s positioning as a leader among developing economies.
- Risk assessment: Misstated economic strength can distort threat/opportunity assessments (for instance, overestimating the economic resilience of an actor might lead to faulty security projections).
- Policy sequencing: When India designs outreach (trade, investment, defence), reliable economic and demographic baselines determine sequencing and resource allocation (who receives prioritized engagements, which forums to convene).

Practical recommendations for use and correction
- Verify membership intent: Confirm whether the table intends to represent the original G‑15, a different coalition, or a bespoke grouping. Reconcile title vs. member count with sponsoring documentation.
- Validate macro data: Cross‑check population, GDP (PPP) and GDP per‑capita figures against authoritative series (World Bank DataBank, IMF WEO) for the same reference year and PPP base. Record the exact series used (indicator code, year).
- Recompute per‑capita values: Standardize units (GDP PPP in USD, population in persons) and recompute GDP per capita = (GDP PPP * 1e9) / population where GDP provided in billions. Flag all mismatches for manual review.
- Timestamp political fields: Attach an “as‑of” date for leaders and ministers, and cite official government sites or respected tracking services (e.g., national foreign ministry websites, IISS, or verified databases).
- Standardize metadata: Add ISO country codes, data year, PPP base year, source links, and field‑level provenance. Ensure CSV/JSON schemas are machine‑readable and documented.
- Maintain a change log: Especially for personnel, keep a log of updates (who changed, when, source) to preserve auditability for later policy analysis.
- Produce a cleaned deliverable: Export both human‑readable (annotated table in the book appendix) and machine‑readable (clean CSV/JSON) datasets for analysts.

Use cases for a cleaned dataset
- Comparative regional weighting: Calculate share of aggregate GDP (PPP) within the group and by region to inform economic diplomacy priorities.
- Aggregate economic footprint: Estimate potential market size and combined purchasing power for trade promotion and defence exports.
- Per‑capita welfare comparisons: Inform development cooperation programs by identifying relative needs and complementarities.
- Diplomatic representation mapping: Link ambassadorial presences, recent high‑level visits, and ministerial portfolios to prioritize bilateral outreach.
- Scenario modelling: Use consistent series to feed economic scenarios into strategic planning (e.g., energy security, migration, and trade disruptions).

Concluding note
For scholars of India’s strategic culture and policymakers alike, empirical rigor in baseline data is not a mere technicality — it shapes the framing of strategic hypotheses, the credibility of diplomatic engagement, and, ultimately, the effectiveness of national security policy. The table reviewed here contains useful raw material but requires careful provenance annotation, arithmetic verification, and temporal stamping before it can be integrated into policy analysis or cited in academic work. The next operational step is to produce a cleaned, fully‑documented dataset (CSV/JSON), with explicit source links, ISO identifiers, and time‑stamped political fields; only then can the material reliably inform India’s strategic calculations in the Global South.

### G‑15 Summits (1990–2012): Timeline, Patterns, and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

This section presents a concise, evidence‑based account of the first fifteen G‑15 summits (1990–2012), and draws out the diplomatic and strategic inferences most relevant to an analysis of India’s strategic culture and national security policy. The G‑15 — a forum of 15 developing countries from Africa, Asia and Latin America — was founded in 1989 to deepen South–South economic cooperation and to coordinate collective positions in global economic governance. The summit record that follows illustrates both the forum’s operational rhythms in the 1990s and early 2000s and the ways in which member states, including India, used the platform to advance economic diplomacy and strategic signalling.

Table: G‑15 summits (ordinal; dates; host country; host city; presiding national leader)
- 1st — 1–3 June 1990; Malaysia; Kuala Lumpur; Mahathir Mohamad  
- 2nd — 27–29 November 1991; Venezuela; Caracas; Carlos Andrés Pérez  
- 3rd — 21–23 November 1992; Senegal; Dakar; Abdou Diouf  
- 4th — 1994 (dates not specified); India; New Delhi; P. V. Narasimha Rao  
- 5th — 5–7 November 1995; Argentina; Buenos Aires; Carlos Menem  
- 6th — 3–5 November 1996; Zimbabwe; Harare; Robert Mugabe  
- 7th — 28 October – 5 November 1997; Malaysia; Kuala Lumpur; Mahathir Mohamad  
- 8th — 11–13 May 1998; Egypt; Cairo; Hosni Mubarak  
- 9th — 10–12 February 1999; Jamaica; Montego Bay; P. J. Patterson  
- 10th — 19–20 June 2000; Egypt; Cairo; Hosni Mubarak  
- 11th — 30–31 May 2001; Indonesia; Jakarta; Abdurrahman Wahid  
- 12th — 27–28 February 2004; Venezuela; Caracas; Hugo Chávez  
- 13th — 14 September 2006; Cuba; Havana; Raúl Castro  
- 14th — 15–17 May 2010; Iran; Tehran; Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  
- 15th — 2012 (dates not specified); Sri Lanka; Colombo; Mahinda Rajapaksa

Analytical observations and implications

- Formation context and purpose:
  - The G‑15 was created in 1989 to provide developing countries a focused vehicle for South–South cooperation, collective economic advocacy, and coordination in global economic fora (e.g., WTO, IMF/World Bank discussions). For India, participation aligned with a post‑Cold War recalibration: using multilateral platforms to advance trade, technology transfer, and development objectives without the constraints of rigid blocs.

- Summit cadence and irregularity:
  - The 1990s show a largely annual summit rhythm, reflecting early institutional momentum. After 2001 the cadence becomes irregular (gaps and variable timing), suggesting operational constraints: competing national priorities, domestic political cycles, and the proliferation of other multilateral mechanisms (G‑20, BRICS) that absorbed political attention and resources.

- Host rotation and repeat hosting:
  - Hosts alternate across regions (Asia, Africa, Latin America, Caribbean, Middle East), confirming the G‑15’s trans‑regional character. Several members hosted more than once (Malaysia: 1st & 7th; Egypt: 8th & 10th; Venezuela: 2nd & 12th), indicating both the limited set of highly active members and informal patterns of leadership re‑emergence. Repeat hosting is a marker of political commitment and diplomatic capacity within the group.

- Leadership visibility and political signalling:
  - Several summits were chaired by high‑visibility national leaders (e.g., Mahathir, Mubarak, Chávez, Castro, Ahmadinejad). Such personalisation of summit leadership served two functions: (a) raised the forum’s profile internationally; (b) allowed presiding leaders to project domestic narratives (developmental success, south‑south solidarity, anti‑hegemonic posture). For India, P. V. Narasimha Rao’s chairing in 1994 coincided with his economic reform agenda, using international platforms to legitimise and promote India’s integration into the global economy.

- Geographic representation and membership diversity:
  - The distribution of host venues demonstrates the G‑15’s attempt to balance regional representation. For India’s strategic culture, engagement in such plural, multiregional groupings reflects a preference for diversified partnerships, hedging strategies, and the promotion of economic security as integral to national security.

- Notable leaders and normative posture:
  - Presence of leaders like Hugo Chávez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad underscores the G‑15’s heterogeneity: membership combined pragmatic economic cooperation with divergent political orientations. This heterogeneity shaped the group’s outputs — mostly consensual economic communiqués rather than binding political programmes — and constrained rapid institutionalisation.

- Data and sourcing caveats:
  - The summit record shows inconsistent date reporting (fully specified dates for many entries; only year provided for some). For rigorous historical or quantitative work, researchers should corroborate summit dates with primary sources (official communiqués, host country records, contemporary press) to ensure timeline precision.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

- Economic diplomacy as security strategy:
  - Hosting the 4th G‑15 summit in New Delhi (1994) was symbolically and substantively aligned with India’s shift under Rao toward economic liberalisation and proactive engagement with developing‑country coalitions. India used the platform to advance issues of trade equity, technology transfer, and reform of international financial institutions — matters that India construed as components of its broader security calculus (economic resilience, autonomy).

- Multilateralism and strategic autonomy:
  - India’s engagement in the G‑15 exemplifies a strand of its strategic culture that privileges multilateral engagement with like‑minded developing states to protect policy space and amplify negotiating leverage. This complements India’s pursuit of strategic autonomy: not alignment with a single bloc, but coalition building across regions to influence global economic governance.

- Institutional lessons:
  - The G‑15’s uneven institutionalisation and later irregular summit cadence offer cautionary lessons: coalitions of developing states can be potent platforms for agenda‑setting when members invest political capital, but they are vulnerable to institutional drift if competing architectures (e.g., G‑20, BRICS) or domestic disruptions reduce member engagement. For policymakers, this highlights the need to calibrate commitments to multiple multilateral groupings to maintain influence without overextending diplomatic bandwidth.

Using the summit breakdown
- Practical uses of the list include constructing timelines, mapping host‑rotation patterns, identifying periods of heightened member activism, and tracing the involvement of individual leaders whose biographies intersect with broader strategic shifts. For a study of India’s strategic culture, the 1994 New Delhi summit is a focal point for understanding how economic reform, leadership initiative, and multilateral outreach combined to shape India’s conception of national security in the 1990s.

Key takeaways (brief)
- The early G‑15 summits reflect an era when South–South coalition building was an active instrument of developing‑country diplomacy.  
- India’s hosting in 1994 occurred at a formative moment for its economic policy and illustrates the use of multilateral fora to project economic and strategic priorities.  
- Variations in summit frequency and repeat hosting identify both institutional strengths (trans‑regional convening capacity) and weaknesses (dependence on individual leaders and shifting global priorities), with clear lessons for contemporary diplomatic strategy.
