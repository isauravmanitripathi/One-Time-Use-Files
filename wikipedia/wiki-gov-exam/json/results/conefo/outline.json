CONEFO was an\nattempt by President Sukarno of Indonesia to create a new bloc of \"emerging\ncountries\" that would be an alternative power centre to the United Nations and\nto the \"old-established forces\" — a category in which Sukarno included both\nthe United States and the Soviet Union. It was intended to build on the legacy\nof the 1955 Bandung Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement, by asserting the\ninterests of the Third World and a neutral posture towards the Cold War.\n\nCONEFO was officially established on 7 January 1965, after Sukarno's\ngovernment objected to Malaysia becoming a non-permanent member of the UN\nSecurity Council, at a time of the low-level Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation\nbetween the two countries. An angry Sukarno took Indonesia out of the UN (the\nonly country to have done so) and formed a rival world organization, having\ntaken similar steps when he created the Games of the New Emerging Forces\n(GANEFO) as an alternative to the Olympic Games in 1963. Indonesia constructed\na new building complex in Jakarta to host CONEFO with the financial aid of the\nPeople's Republic of China.\n\nCONEFO never met before it was dissolved on 11 August 1966 by General Suharto\nafter ousting Sukarno from power. Indonesia rejoined the United Nations and\nthe CONEFO complex, now called the MPR/DPR/DPD building, became the seat of\nthe People's Consultative Assembly.",

    "enhanced_section_content_md": "### CONEFO (Conference of the New Emerging Forces): Sukarno’s Attempt to Reorder Cold‑War Institutions\n\nBackground and placement in Sukarno’s foreign policy\n- CONEFO — the Conference of the New Emerging Forces — was conceived by Indonesia’s President Sukarno in the mid‑1960s as an intergovernmental forum intended to gather “new” or “emerging” states into an alternative centre of international influence. In the canonical treatment of Sukarno’s foreign policy it sits under the broader theme of Third World solidarity and anti‑imperialist diplomacy, following the precedents of the 1955 Bandung Conference and the Non‑Aligned Movement (NAM).\n- Whereas Bandung and NAM sought to carve out a third‑way in Cold War diplomacy through multilateral engagement and consensus, CONEFO represented a more radical, personalised effort to build parallel institutions when existing international bodies (most conspicuously the United Nations) were viewed as captured by the “old‑established forces” — namely the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nOrigins, objectives and triggers\n- Officially established on 7 January 1965 (per Sukarno’s proclamation), CONEFO was framed as an institutional embodiment of “new emerging forces” — postcolonial, anti‑imperialist states that purportedly shared interests distinct from the two superpower blocs.\n- The immediate political trigger was Indonesia’s objection to Malaysia’s election as a non‑permanent member of the UN Security Council during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (Konfrontasi). Sukarno perceived the UN decision as politically biased and, in protest, Indonesia temporarily withdrew from the United Nations — an episode often described as unique because Indonesia was the only country to effect a formal, if brief, withdrawal from UN membership.\n- CONEFO was envisioned to extend Sukarno’s strategy of creating alternatives to established global institutions; this approach mirrored his earlier sporting initiative, GANEFO (Games of the New Emerging Forces, 1963), which had been presented as an alternative to the Olympic movement for countries outside Western influence.\n\nPlanned organisation and material infrastructure\n- Sukarno initiated construction of a dedicated CONEFO complex in Jakarta. Beijing financed the project, signalling closer Sino–Indonesian cooperation and the People’s Republic of China’s interest in underwriting Third World institutional ventures that bypassed Western‑dominated structures.\n- Despite the physical preparations and political rhetoric, CONEFO never convened a plenary conference or developed into a functioning international organisation with sustained membership and activity.\n\nDomestic politics and the limits of personality‑driven institutions\n- The fate of CONEFO was tightly bound to Sukarno’s political survival. Following the domestic crisis of 1965–1966 and Sukarno’s ouster, General Suharto dissolved CONEFO on 11 August 1966. Indonesia then rejoined the United Nations and reversed much of the previous administration’s confrontational international posture.\n- The rapid disappearance of CONEFO underscores a recurring lesson from Cold War Third World initiatives: durable alternative institutions require more than charisma and symbolism; they require broad international buy‑in, bureaucratic continuity, and domestic political stability — prerequisites absent in Indonesia after 1965.\n\nMaterial afterlife and symbolic legacy\n- The CONEFO building in Jakarta was repurposed after Sukarno’s fall; it later became the legislative complex housing the People’s Consultative Assembly (MPR), the House of Representatives (DPR), and the Regional Representative Council (DPD). The structure therefore acquired a different institutional meaning in the New Order period.\n- Although CONEFO had no operational record, it remains salient as a symbol of mid‑1960s Third World activism and of Sukarno’s tendency to externalise domestic political narratives into grand international projects.\n\nGeopolitical significance and Sino‑Indonesian dimension\n- China’s financial support for the CONEFO complex illustrates Beijing’s strategic use of development assistance to cultivate influence among postcolonial states and to support fora outside Western or Soviet institutional control.\n- CONEFO thus sits at the intersection of regional nationalism, Sino‑Third World diplomacy, and the broader competition to shape Global South agendas during the Cold War.\n\nImplications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy\n- Comparative lesson 1 — institutionalism versus personality: India’s strategic culture, exemplified by Jawaharlal Nehru’s diplomacy, tended to privilege institution‑building within existing multilateral frameworks (UN, Bandung/NAM leadership through diplomatic coalition building) rather than creating rival structures premised on the personal leadership of a single state. CONEFO illustrates the risks of constructing parallel institutions whose continuity depends on a single leader’s political fortunes.\n- Comparative lesson 2 — normative leadership and credibility: India’s approach to non‑alignment emphasized normative credibility (legal‑institutional engagement, leadership in NAM deliberations) which made its influence more resilient to leadership transitions. CONEFO’s failure reinforces the advantage of embedding Third World agendas within recognisable, durable institutional architectures.\n- Comparative lesson 3 — linkage between domestic stability and external agency: CONEFO demonstrates how domestic political fragility can nullify ambitious external projects. For Indian planners concerned with national security, it underscores that international influence is constrained by internal cohesion and predictable institutions.\n- Comparative lesson 4 — great‑power competition in the Global South: China’s backing of CONEFO is an early example of great‑power patronage aimed at shaping Third World institutions — a pattern that has contemporary resonance. Indian policymakers should therefore read CONEFO as an archetype of how external patrons can amplify or entrench alternative governance agendas in the Global South.\n\nOpen questions and research directions\n- Membership intent: Which countries were formally invited, or were intended to be members, and what responses did they give? Diplomatic archives in Jakarta, New Delhi, Cairo and Beijing may illuminate the prospective membership map.\n- Charter and agenda: Were formal charters, working papers or policy agendas drafted before dissolution? Indonesian government documents and GANEFO planning records might show whether substantive programmatic work had begun.\n- Financial arrangements with the PRC: What were the precise terms of Chinese financing for the Jakarta complex? PRC‑Indonesia bilateral records and Chinese foreign‑aid archives could provide answers.\n- Reception in the Third World: How did other major postcolonial states (India, Egypt, Ghana, etc.) assess CONEFO—endorsement, indifference or rejection? Contemporary press, NAM minutes and personal correspondence of Third World leaders are relevant sources.\n- UN records and the Security Council controversy: Examination of UN General Assembly and Security Council proceedings (1964–1966) will clarify international reactions to Indonesia’s withdrawal and to the Malaysia seat controversy.\n- Domestic constraints: How did the domestic political dynamics of 1965–1966 in Indonesia preclude CONEFO from convening? Indonesian military and civilian archives, plus memoirs of key actors, are critical.\n\nKey dates and principal actors\n- 1955 — Bandung Conference: important precedent and normative frame for Third World cooperation.\n- 1963 — GANEFO created by Sukarno as an alternative to the Olympics; conceptual antecedent to CONEFO.\n- 7 January 1965 — Sukarno proclaims the establishment of CONEFO.\n- 11 August 1966 — CONEFO dissolved by General Suharto following Sukarno’s fall.\n- Principal actors: President Sukarno (initiator), General Suharto (successor who dissolved CONEFO), and the People’s Republic of China (financial backer of the CONEFO complex).\n- Contextual driver: Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (Konfrontasi) — immediate diplomatic grievance that prompted the UN withdrawal and the CONEFO initiative.\n\nConcluding assessment\n- CONEFO is an instructive case of an ambitious, personality‑driven attempt to reorder the international system from the periphery. Its abortive trajectory highlights the structural constraints on creating rival global institutions: lack of durable coalition support, dependence on domestic political stability, and vulnerability to regime change.\n- For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, CONEFO offers a comparative mirror: it affirms the relative prudence of institutional engagement, the value of normative credibility, and the strategic limits of symbolism when divorced from administrative capacity and broad-based international legitimacy."
