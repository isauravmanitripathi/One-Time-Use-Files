### International research institute in Colombia — International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT / Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical)

Overview
- Name (English): International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).
- Name (Spanish): Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical — CIAT.
- Location: Headquartered in Palmira, Colombia, with programs and partnerships across Latin America, Africa and Asia.
- Affiliation: One of the agricultural research centres within the CGIAR network.
- Staffing and scale: Employs more than 300 scientists, reflecting a substantive multidisciplinary research capacity.
- Mission: Dedicated to reducing poverty and hunger while protecting natural resources in developing countries through research and innovation.

Institutional evolution and the Alliance
- CIAT has long been a key CGIAR centre focused on tropical agriculture, crop improvement and sustainable land use. In 2019 CIAT formally joined with Bioversity International to create the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT.
- Purpose of the Alliance: to deliver research-based solutions that harness agricultural biodiversity and sustainably transform food systems to improve people’s lives. The merger combined CIAT’s strengths in tropical agriculture and sustainable landscapes with Bioversity’s expertise in agrobiodiversity and genetic resource management, broadening the Alliance’s scope from crop and land interventions to a more explicit biodiversity-centred food-systems approach.

Core research strengths and thematic focus
- Crop improvement and genetic resources: breeding for productivity, resilience and nutrition in crops adapted to the tropics.
- Sustainable land use and landscape management: integrating soil health, water management and agroecological practices to maintain productivity while protecting ecosystems.
- Agrobiodiversity and gene-bank management: conservation and use of genetic resources for resilience and adaptation.
- Climate resilience: developing varieties, practices and landscape approaches that reduce vulnerability to climate shocks and long-term trends.
- Food-system transformation: research aimed at linking production to markets, value chains, nutrition outcomes and policy interventions.
- Multidisciplinary capacity: the >300 scientific staff typically include plant breeders, soil scientists, climatologists, socio-economists, data scientists and policy analysts — enabling integrated research-to-practice pathways.

Role within CGIAR and global agricultural research
- CGIAR is a global partnership that coordinates international agricultural research for development; CIAT (now part of the Alliance) contributes to CGIAR’s objectives of productivity, resilience, nutrition and sustainability.
- The Alliance model is oriented to translate research into practical solutions — from breeding and seed systems to farm-level practices and policy advice — and to scale those solutions via partnerships with national research systems, donors, NGOs and the private sector.

Stakeholders and operational partners
- Primary stakeholders include national agricultural research systems (NARS) in tropical countries, farmers and farming communities, donors and development agencies, NGOs working on rural development, and private-sector actors in seed systems and supply chains.
- Geographic positioning in Colombia provides strategic access to tropical agroecologies and facilitates collaborative research across Latin America and other tropical regions.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Food and nutrition security: Institutes like CIAT generate technologies and practices that reduce agrarian vulnerability — a core element of national resilience and food sovereignty important to India’s strategic calculus.
- Climate adaptation and landscape resilience: CIAT’s work on climate-resilient varieties and sustainable land management offers transferable knowledge to India’s tropical and sub‑tropical agro-ecologies, informing domestic adaptation strategies and military-civil resilience planning in climate‑sensitive regions.
- Biodiversity, germplasm and biosafety governance: The Alliance’s emphasis on agrobiodiversity highlights governance questions (access and benefit-sharing, ex situ/in situ conservation) that intersect with India’s strategic interests in genetic resources, seed policy and biosecurity.
- International cooperation and soft power: Engagement with CGIAR centres and alliances supports India’s scientific diplomacy — joint projects, capacity building and technology transfer can strengthen bilateral ties with tropical countries and advance India’s development diplomacy.
- Lessons for policy and institutions: The Alliance’s integrated model — bridging breeding, landscape management, value chains and policy — provides a template for Indian policymakers seeking to align agricultural research with national security goals (rural stability, food-system resilience, and climate adaptation).

Concluding note
CIAT, now functioning within the Alliance with Bioversity International, exemplifies how international agricultural research centres operate at the intersection of science, development and policy. For strategic analysts and policymakers in India, such institutions are not peripheral research partners but critical nodes that influence food security, climate resilience, biodiversity governance and international cooperation — all components with clear bearing on India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

## CIAT’s Gene Bank, “Future Seeds,” and Strategic Implications for India’s Food Security

Overview and institutional role
- The International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) is one of 11 gene banks maintained under the CGIAR umbrella, and therefore a key node in the global system of crop genetic conservation. CIAT’s ex situ collections total more than 65,000 accessions, drawn from over 100 countries. The principal holdings are:
  - Common bean (Phaseolus spp.): ~37,000 accessions
  - Tropical forages: ~23,000 accessions
  - Cassava (Manihot esculenta): ~6,000 accessions
- These collections perform multiple functions simultaneously: preservation of crop biodiversity, raw material for breeding and varietal development, insurance against crop failure and genetic erosion, and a global public good that underpins food and livelihood security.

“Future Seeds” — capacity, design, and functions
- In 2022 CIAT inaugurated a new facility, “Future Seeds,” financed by a coalition of funders including the United Kingdom and the Colombian government among others. The facility:
  - Expands CIAT’s long‑term conservation capacity up to 250,000 accessions, substantially increasing the scope for both broader crop coverage and longer‑term storage;
  - Is presented as an architectural landmark and environmentally sustainable building, and aspires to act as a hub for research, learning and public engagement.
- Strategic significance of the expansion:
  - A larger repository increases capacity to support global and regional breeding programmes, including pre‑breeding and the provision of base material for stress‑tolerant varieties;
  - Physical and reputational prominence (sustainability, architecture) helps attract partnerships, donors and public attention — a non‑trivial factor in the maintenance of long‑term funding for genebanks.

CIAT’s crop improvement work and regional coordination
- CIAT has a sustained research programme on grain legumes, with historical emphasis (noted in documentation as of 2013) on breeding for:
  - Drought tolerance
  - Tolerance to low‑phosphorus soils
  - Heat tolerance
  - Improved biological nitrogen fixation
- These trait priorities directly address climate change impacts and the agronomic realities of smallholder and marginal soils.
- Beyond breeding, CIAT has played a coordination role in technology transfer and capacity building. A salient example is its coordination of the Pan‑Africa Bean Research Alliance (PABRA), covering 29 countries in sub‑Saharan Africa. PABRA’s activities were supported by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), illustrating how multilateral technical partnerships and donor support mobilize regional uptake of improved germplasm and agronomic practices.

Conservation logic: ex situ, in situ, backups and risk management
- Ex situ gene banks like CIAT’s complement in situ conservation carried out by farmers and ecosystems. Best practice for global seed security includes duplication/safety back‑ups (for example, safety copies in other long‑term storage facilities) to reduce risks from localized disasters, institutional failure or funding shocks.
- Expanding physical capacity and diversifying storage locations contributes to resilience of the global conservation system; nonetheless, genebanks remain vulnerable to political and financial fluctuations because they rely on multi‑stakeholder donor commitments.

Legal, policy and governance context
- Access to and use of CIAT’s collections is governed by international and national legal frameworks — notably the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (ITPGRFA) and access and benefit‑sharing (ABS) arrangements under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). These frameworks:
  - Regulate germplasm exchange, material transfer and benefit‑sharing obligations;
  - Shape how countries (including India) can access genetic material for breeding, and how benefits from commercialization or use are shared.
- For policymakers and practitioners, the legal regimes determine both operational freedom and political sensitivities around germplasm flows.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Food and agricultural resilience as national security: CIAT’s role in conserving bean, cassava and forage diversity has direct bearings on food, nutritional and livestock feed security — issues central to India’s strategic calculus in the face of climate stress, population pressures and supply‑chain disruptions.
- Collaborative advantage and technological access: India’s national programmes in crop improvement and climate adaptation can benefit from engagement with CGIAR gene banks like CIAT’s through germplasm access, joint research and capacity building. At the same time, India must calibrate ABS and safeguarding policies to secure equitable access and domestic benefit.
- Biosecurity and sovereignty concerns: The transnational flow of germplasm raises legitimate concerns about phytosanitary standards, intellectual property, and sovereignty over genetic resources. India’s strategic posture should balance openness for scientific collaboration with robust regulatory and quarantine safeguards.
- Institutional learning and capacity building: CIAT’s coordination role (e.g., PABRA) exemplifies how technical institutions can scale regional adoption of improved varieties. India can look to similar regional coordination mechanisms (SAARC/BBIN ecosystems, bilateral research partnerships) to extend adaptive breeding and seed systems support in South Asia.
- Funding resilience and strategic partnerships: The “Future Seeds” funding model — multiple governments and donors — highlights the necessity of diversified funding for critical global public goods. India’s engagement as both a partner and funder in CGIAR and parallel repositories would strengthen its influence over global germplasm governance and secure technical access for domestic needs.

Caveats and the need for up‑to‑date appraisal
- Some research descriptions (e.g., the statement dated “as of 2013”) may be outdated; national strategists and researchers should verify current CIAT programmes and priorities. Crop research agendas evolve rapidly with new climate scenarios, genomic tools and policy shifts.
- The multi‑stakeholder funding model that sustained facilities like Future Seeds also creates vulnerability to geopolitical shifts in donor priorities; strategic planners should factor continuity risks into long‑term agricultural resilience policies.

Conclusion — policy takeaways for India
- CIAT’s expanded genebank capacity and its legume research portfolio are salient components of the global infrastructure that underpins agricultural resilience. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy this implies:
  - Proactive engagement with global gene banks for germplasm access, research partnerships and policy influence;
  - Strengthening domestic ex situ and in situ conservation, with clear duplication and backup arrangements aligned to international legal commitments;
  - Integrating germplasm governance, biosecurity and ABS considerations into national security planning; and
  - Supporting diversified, durable funding and institutional partnerships that sustain the global public goods essential to food and nutritional security.

This integrated perspective situates CIAT’s technical and institutional contributions within broader strategic concerns — a useful lens for Indian policymakers seeking to translate global agricultural public goods into national resilience.
