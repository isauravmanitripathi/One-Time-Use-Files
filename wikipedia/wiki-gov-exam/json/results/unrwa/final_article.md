## UNRWA: Mandate, Evolution, and Contemporary Challenges

Pronunciation: UNRWA (/ˈʌnrə/) — the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

Overview
- UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly in 1949 to provide relief and works programs for the large population of Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab–Israeli war (the Nakba) and subsequent conflicts. It is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly and — uniquely among UN refugee bodies — its operational mandate is subject to triennial renewal by the Assembly (most recently extended to 30 June 2026).
- As an operational humanitarian and social-service agency, UNRWA has evolved from short‑term relief and employment projects to a broad provider of education, primary health care, social services, microfinance and emergency relief. It operates principally in five areas: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip, and the West Bank (including East Jerusalem).
- Registration statistics: UNRWA registered more than 5.6 million Palestine refugees as of 2019 (registration criteria and the number of registered persons are politically sensitive and have been periodically revised).

Mandate, Legal Status and Distinctiveness
- Legal status: UNRWA is a distinct UN subsidiary organ established by the General Assembly. It is institutionalized by a specific UN resolution and governance arrangement that differs from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which was created in 1950 as a separate UN agency.
- Uniqueness of registration: UNRWA’s definition of “refugee” extends refugee status to the descendants of those who fled or were expelled in 1948 (including legally adopted children). This inter‑generational definition is exceptional within the UN system and is a principal reason UNRWA’s caseload remains large and politically salient.
- Geographical / institutional boundary: Palestinian refugees living outside UNRWA’s five fields of operation fall under UNHCR’s mandate; UNRWA remains the only UN agency dedicated specifically to refugees from a particular conflict/region.

Historical development and operations
- Foundation and early years: From its 1949 foundation, UNRWA was tasked with immediate relief and relief‑to‑work schemes. In its early phase it operated for both Arab and Jewish displaced populations in Mandatory Palestine; after the Israeli government assumed responsibility for Jewish refugees within Israel in 1952, UNRWA’s client base stabilized as the Palestinian refugee population.
- Evolving role: Over decades, UNRWA’s operational model expanded from temporary relief and public works into long‑term human development services — in particular education (running hundreds of primary and secondary schools), primary health care clinics, social safety nets, and emergency response. This service footprint makes UNRWA a major service provider within Palestinian communities.

Staffing, governance and accountability
- Personnel: UNRWA employs over 30,000 people, the majority of whom are Palestinian refugees recruited locally; a much smaller number are international staff. This makes UNRWA simultaneously a major local employer and a lightning rod for debates over neutrality, recruitment and oversight.
- Accountability mechanisms: Investigations into staff misconduct typically proceed through internal review processes, often accompanied or supplemented by donor‑commissioned probes. Outcomes have direct operational consequences: adverse findings can prompt suspensions, staff dismissals, and — critically — temporary withdrawal of donor funding.

Funding model and vulnerabilities
- Voluntary funding: UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from states, regional organizations and private donors. Its budgetary dependence on discretionary generosity renders the agency vulnerable to geopolitical shifts and donor politics; funding shortfalls have repeatedly impaired services and led to emergency funding appeals.
- Political leverage: Because donors can and do suspend or condition contributions, political controversies can produce immediate humanitarian effects for tens of thousands (and, in aggregate, millions) of refugees dependent on UNRWA services.

Security, neutrality and operational environment
- Operating in high‑intensity conflict zones (notably Gaza and parts of Syria and the West Bank) complicates UNRWA’s ability to maintain operational neutrality, safeguard staff and ensure unimpeded humanitarian access. The agency’s facilities and personnel have at times been caught in hostilities, and accusations — whether substantiated or not — that facilities were used for military purposes generate domestic and international scrutiny.
- These security constraints intersect with the agency’s role as a long‑term service provider: schools and health centres are essential community infrastructure but also potential strategic targets or contested sites in armed conflict.

Reputation, controversies and recent crises
- Recognition and critique: Over its history UNRWA has received both praise from governments and independent monitors for its humanitarian contributions and criticism for operational shortcomings, alleged politicization, and the political implications of its inter‑generational refugee definition.
- Allegations following 7 October (Oct 7) events: In the aftermath of the October 7 attacks in 2023, the Israeli government alleged that a number of UNRWA staff were involved in hostilities. Israeli authorities reported that 12 UNRWA employees were implicated, prompting UNRWA to suspend and dismiss some staff and to initiate investigations. These allegations led a number of donor states temporarily to suspend funding pending investigation; by mid‑2024 several major donors had resumed funding while investigations continued (the donor landscape has remained dynamic and should be referenced against the latest sources).
- Parliamentary designation and ban by Israel (2024–2025): In October 2024 the Israeli Knesset passed legislation designating UNRWA a terrorist organization and outlawing its operations within Israel. That designation went into effect in January 2025. This development constitutes an extraordinary legal and political move by a UN member state against a UN subsidiary organ and raises complex questions about the agency’s ability to operate in areas under Israeli control, the legal exposure of staff and the broader political dynamics around the Palestinian refugee issue.
- Political dimensions: Israel has long opposed international policies that, in its view, entrench or perpetuate the right of return; it has also been a consistent critic of UNRWA’s mandate and practices. The combination of domestic political pressure, security incidents, and donor responses has repeatedly tested UNRWA’s operational resilience.

Coordination with the UN system and policy implications
- Interagency coordination: UNRWA routinely coordinates with UNHCR, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), and other UN bodies and international NGOs for protection, humanitarian response and contingency planning. Effective coordination is necessary to avoid duplication, ensure protection standards, and mount large‑scale emergency responses.
- Accountability to donors and the General Assembly: As a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, UNRWA reports to member states, which retain political and financial leverage through mandate renewal and voluntary contributions.

Consequences, risks and likely trajectories
- Service fragility: Continued politicization, legal actions by member states, and funding volatility carry immediate humanitarian risks — degradation of education, health and social protection services for millions of registered refugees.
- Institutional survival and reform pressures: Political controversies intensify pressure for institutional reforms (governance, oversight, staff vetting, curriculum review), but reform efforts occur in a context of highly polarized politics in which consensus among donors and stakeholders is hard to achieve.
- Legal and operational uncertainty: The designation by a UN member state of UNRWA as a terrorist organization sets a precedent with potential legal ramifications for staff, suppliers and partners operating in or through Israeli jurisdiction. It also complicates the agency’s ability to function within territories where Israeli law or administrative measures have effect.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Multilateral engagement and principles: UNRWA’s trajectory underscores how humanitarian agencies can become sites of geopolitical contestation. For Indian foreign policy and strategic culture, this highlights the importance of principled engagement with multilateral humanitarian organizations while recognizing their exposure to donor politics.
- Operational lessons: India’s increasing involvement in UN peacekeeping and humanitarian diplomacy benefits from understanding the operational dilemmas UNRWA faces — neutrality in asymmetric conflicts, staff recruitment from affected populations, and managing donor conditionality.
- Policy implications: Indian strategists should note three linked lessons: (1) humanitarian operations are politically salient and can affect strategic calculations, (2) reliance on voluntary funding can create instability in service delivery, and (3) legal and political actions by states against international organizations create precedents that may affect India’s diplomatic options and obligations.
- Diplomatic posture: India’s approach to disputes over UN agencies should balance support for multilateral institutions and humanitarian norms with pragmatic assessments of how politicization can imperil beneficiaries on the ground.

Concluding observation
UNRWA exemplifies how a humanitarian agency, conceived as a temporary relief mechanism, can evolve into a long‑standing and politically charged institution. Its unique legal status, multigenerational remit, and deep operational footprint make it indispensable to millions of Palestinians — and simultaneously vulnerable to geopolitical shifts. For scholars and practitioners of strategic policy, UNRWA is a case study in the intersection of humanitarianism, international law, state sovereignty and the politics of memory and displacement.

## History and Operations

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is a distinctive institution in the post‑Second World War international system: born of an acute regional conflict, created to combine immediate humanitarian relief with an eye toward longer‑term reintegration, and sustained through recurring renewals of a mandate that has outlived the political settlement that originally motivated it. Understanding UNRWA’s origins, mandate evolution, and operational characteristics is essential for students of international organization and for policymakers—such as those shaping India’s strategic culture—because it exemplifies how humanitarian governance becomes institutionalized, politicized, and routinized across decades.

### Origins and legal‑political context

- The immediate context was the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and the resultant Palestinian exodus: more than 700,000 Palestinians were displaced, generating a mass humanitarian crisis that the nascent UN system was called upon to address.
- On 19 November 1948 the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 212 (III), establishing the UN Relief for Palestine Refugees (UNRPR) to provide emergency relief in coordination with other UN and humanitarian bodies.
- In December 1948 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 194, which created the United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP) with a political mandate: to facilitate repatriation, resettlement, and rehabilitation of refugees and to assist in reaching a final settlement.
- The UNCCP, however, lacked the political leverage to resolve the broader “Palestine problem,” a task that required negotiated political solutions beyond its mandate and the capacity of early postwar multilateral institutions.

Faced with the persistence of refugee needs and the limits of a conciliation commission, the UNCCP recommended a dedicated agency to continue relief activities and to initiate job‑creation and works projects while a political resolution remained pending. Pursuant to this recommendation and paragraph 11 of Resolution 194, the General Assembly adopted Resolution 302(IV) on 8 December 1949, thereby establishing UNRWA. The vote was unopposed: Israel and the Arab states supported the creation, while the Soviet bloc and South Africa abstained.

### Mandate, early operations and evolutions

- UNRWA formally succeeded the earlier UNRPR. Its founding charter combined a humanitarian remit with an explicit requirement to operate neutrally in a politically charged environment.
- When it began operations in 1950, UNRWA’s principal tasks were “direct relief and works programmes” aimed at preventing starvation and acute distress and at promoting stability in a volatile region.
- In December 1950 the General Assembly expanded UNRWA’s role through Resolution 393(V), creating a reintegration fund intended to facilitate the permanent re‑establishment of refugees and to remove them from relief dependence.
- A subsequent resolution on 26 January 1952 substantially reallocated priorities and resources: funding for reintegration was increased to four times that devoted to relief, while UNRWA was instructed to continue health, education and welfare programmes. This reflected early UN hopes that refugees could be resettled and reintegrated rather than remain indefinitely on relief rolls.

These early shifts—moving from emergency relief to greater emphasis on reintegration and on public services—set the pattern for the agency’s later evolution. Over time, UNRWA transitioned from a short‑term relief operation to a long‑term service provider, increasingly associated with education, primary healthcare, social services, and refugee‑camp administration.

### Geographic scope, legal status and renewal

- UNRWA specifically serves Palestine refugees in five fields: the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.
- Unlike UNHCR, which operates under a global refugee protection framework for non‑Palestinian refugees, UNRWA was created expressly for Palestine refugees; its mandate is therefore unique and functionally separate from UNHCR’s legal architecture.
- Importantly, UNRWA’s mandate is not permanent by statute but renewable: the UN General Assembly has periodically renewed and adjusted the agency’s mandate since 1950, making its existence a recurring political decision by the international community.

### Institutional features, funding and political tensions

- UNRWA is funded almost entirely by voluntary contributions from UN member states and other donors. This modal dependence on discretionary financing makes the agency vulnerable to shifting donor priorities, political pressures, and episodic funding shortfalls.
- The requirement of operational neutrality codified at UNRWA’s founding has been a persistent source of tension. Neutrality obligations confront highly politicized environments, host‑country sensitivities, and contested narratives about refugee identity and rights.
- Over the decades, UNRWA has attracted criticism on several fronts—allegations concerning neutrality or partiality, controversies over staffing drawn from refugee communities, the long‑term normalization of relief‑dependence, and operational constraints in states with complex domestic politics.

### Implications and strategic significance

- The establishment of UNRWA institutionalized long‑term international responsibility for Palestine refugees and thereby transformed an emergency humanitarian task into a multigenerational governance challenge. That institutionalization helps explain why operational relief has outlasted effective political solutions.
- The early emphasis on reintegration (1950–1952) highlights a key paradox: while the UN sought to move refugees off relief rolls into permanent solutions, the political conditions for such solutions—territorial settlement, durable repatriation or resettlement—proved intractable. Mandate expansions and resource reallocations thus reflect aspirational policy that was not matched by political feasibility.
- Donor dependence and neutrality requirements together generate persistent operational and political tensions: donors can exert leverage through (dis)continuation of funds, while neutrality is hard to sustain in the face of asymmetrical power, occupation, and national security narratives.

For readers situated within India’s strategic culture and national security policymaking community, UNRWA offers several lessons:
- Multilateral humanitarian institutions can become enduring actors that shape regional political realities independent of immediate political settlements. India’s engagement in multilateral humanitarian diplomacy should therefore account for the long‑term institutional effects of such agencies.
- The donor‑dependence model creates strategic vulnerabilities and leverage points; states that seek to shape outcomes (either to stabilize a region or to influence political trajectories) will find humanitarian funding an effective instrument of foreign policy.
- Neutrality in humanitarian operations is a normative ideal but a fragile operational practice when humanitarian action overlaps with unresolved territorial and political disputes. For India, balancing principled support for refugee protection with strategic relationships across the Middle East requires careful calibration in multilateral fora.

### Key dates (summary)

- 19 Nov 1948 — UNGA Resolution 212 (III): establishes UNRPR for emergency relief.  
- Dec 1948 — UNGA Resolution 194: establishes UNCCP (repatriation/resettlement mandate).  
- 8 Dec 1949 — UNGA Resolution 302(IV): establishes UNRWA.  
- 1950 — UNRWA begins operations focusing on relief and works programmes.  
- Dec 1950 — UNGA Resolution 393(V): expands UNRWA’s mandate to include a reintegration fund.  
- 26 Jan 1952 — Resolution reallocates funding priorities: increased financing for reintegration relative to relief; continuation of health, education, welfare programs.

### Principal actors

- United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)  
- UN Relief for Palestine Refugees (UNRPR) — precursor body  
- United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine (UNCCP)  
- United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA)  
- Palestine refugees and their host communities  
- Member states (including Israel, Arab states, Soviet bloc, South Africa), donor governments, and host countries (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, West Bank, Gaza)

This compact history and operational sketch situates UNRWA as a paradigmatic case of how humanitarian imperatives, institutional design, and geopolitical contestation interact—an important reference point for scholars and practitioners interested in the intersection of humanitarian governance and strategic policy.

### UNRWA’s Operational Definition, Mandate and Policy Implications for Indian Strategic Culture

Introduction
- The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) occupies a unique place in the international refugee architecture. Its distinctive operational definition of who counts as a “Palestine refugee,” the way its mandate has evolved, and the administrative practices that flow from that mandate have consequences not only for humanitarian delivery in the Levant but also for the diplomatic, development and security calculations of third‑party states — including India. For a reader concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, understanding UNRWA’s institutional logic clarifies how humanitarian instruments interact with regional politics, refugee rhythms, and multilateral funding debates that affect geopolitical stability.

Operational (humanitarian/administrative) definition of “refugee”
- UNRWA deliberately formulated an operational “working definition” of a Palestine refugee to enable large‑scale humanitarian assistance and registration. The agency’s definition is administrative: it identifies as Palestine refugees persons who had their habitual residence in Palestine between 1 June 1946 and 15 May 1948 and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 conflict. This definition was purposefully service‑oriented — designed to set eligibility for relief, education, health and social services — not to adjudicate legal claims or to resolve political questions such as the right of return.

Temporal scope, the 1967 displacement and subsequent extensions
- The 1946–1948 temporal criterion left out those displaced in later hostilities, most notably the large population movements after the 1967 Six‑Day War. Over time, the General Assembly has augmented UNRWA’s operational coverage: beginning in practice and then formalized through annual General Assembly resolutions from 1991 onwards, persons displaced as a result of the 1967 hostilities were brought within UNRWA’s operational remit. These incremental political decisions demonstrate how UNRWA’s coverage can expand by intergovernmental consensus without altering the original 1948 legal question.

Mandate as an aggregate of General Assembly resolutions
- Unlike many international organi zations that are grounded in a single founding charter or treaty, UNRWA’s “mandate” is cumulative. It exists as the aggregate of successive General Assembly resolutions, requests and clarifications concerning its activities. Consequently, the scope of UNRWA’s responsibilities is politically malleable: changes in mandate or extension of coverage typically occur through GA action, reflecting shifting diplomatic balances rather than a formal treaty amendment process.

Intergenerational registration and eligibility categories
- UNRWA’s administrative practice has led to a broad and growing registerable population. Registration rules have long permitted the descendants of registered Palestine refugees (notably descendants in practice traced through registered male refugees, with adopted children also eligible) to be registered for services. This intergenerational transmission of eligibility, combined with later inclusion of 1967‑displaced persons and occasional extensions to other affected community members, has significantly increased the number of people eligible for UNRWA services over time. In consequence, many registered individuals are beneficiaries of humanitarian services without that registration being a legal adjudication of refugee status or of claims such as repatriation.

Distinction from UNHCR and legal vs administrative status
- UNRWA’s mandate and operational definition stand apart from the global refugee regime under the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). UNHCR’s remit — defined by a distinct mandate, conventions and legal adjudicative mechanisms — covers refugees worldwide except Palestine refugees in UNRWA’s areas of operations. Because UNRWA’s definition is humanitarian and administrative, registration with UNRWA does not constitute a legal determination of refugee status under international refugee law, nor does it resolve political claims (for example, the right of return). This administrative/legal distinction matters for states crafting policy responses: aid entitlement and legal refugee protections follow different institutional pathways.

Operational scope and field presence
- UNRWA concentrates its work in five principal fields of operations: Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. These theatres are where historical displacement patterns, intergenerational registration, and concentrated dependency on UNRWA services are most pronounced. In each context the agency’s schools, clinics and relief programmes are central to social stability — and therefore to regional security dynamics.

Political and fiscal consequences
- The expansion of eligibility and the unique historical mandate make UNRWA a focal point of contested politics. Debates over the content and extent of UNRWA’s mandate frequently surface in General Assembly diplomacy and international funding rounds. Changes in donor contributions, politicized scrutiny of UNRWA’s operations, or shifts in GA wording have immediate humanitarian consequences on the ground and downstream security implications for host states and the region. The agency thereby sits at the intersection of humanitarian policy and geopolitical bargaining.

Implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- For India, several practical and strategic considerations arise from UNRWA’s institutional design:
  - Humanitarian diplomacy: India’s voting and funding choices concerning UNRWA are signals of its broader approach to Middle‑East multilateralism and to balancing relationships with Arab states, Israel and Palestinian authorities.
  - Stability and migration risk: UNRWA’s schools and clinics underpin social stability in fragile contexts. Disruptions in UNRWA funding or mandate can amplify humanitarian distress and displacement pressures, with potential secondary effects (e.g., migration, radicalization) that concern Indian national security calculus in broader terms.
  - Multilateral precedent: UNRWA’s reliance on GA resolutions as the source of mandate expansion offers a model of how humanitarian jurisdiction can be politically negotiated — a useful reference point for India in engaging with international organizations and in defending or reforming multilateral practice.
  - Operational partnerships: India’s technical assistance, contributions or development cooperation in the region must account for UNRWA’s administrative categories: eligibility for services hinges on registration rather than legal adjudication, which shapes program design and beneficiary targeting.

Conclusion
- UNRWA represents a distinctive blend of humanitarian administration and politically mediated mandate‑making. Its operational definition of “refugee,” intergenerational registration practices, and mandate evolution by General Assembly action produce a set of institutional realities with direct humanitarian consequences and indirect security and diplomatic implications. For policymakers and strategists in India — who balance principles of non‑alignment, growing geostrategic interests in West Asia, and a developing posture in multilateral institutions — a nuanced appreciation of UNRWA’s institutional logic is essential. It helps Indian decision‑makers assess how humanitarian instruments can shape regional stability, influence diplomatic alignments, and intersect with India’s own national security priorities.

## UNRWA: Institutional Design, Mandate and Operational Dynamics

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) occupies a distinctive place within the UN system. Created by the General Assembly and sustained through repeated GA resolutions, UNRWA is structurally and legally different from most other multilateral humanitarian institutions. Its particular institutional design—rooted in a narrowly defined beneficiary group, periodic mandate renewals, and heavy dependence on voluntary donor funding—has persistent implications for operations, accountability and politics in protracted conflict settings.

Legal and institutional basis
- UNRWA was established by the UN General Assembly pursuant to the Charter’s provisions that empower the Assembly to discharge functions and create subsidiary organs (notably Articles 7(2) and 22). Its legal basis is therefore GA resolution rather than a treaty-based constitution or a broadly drafted statute.
- This origin makes UNRWA an atypical UN entity: unlike agencies founded on constitutions or statute instruments (for example, WHO’s constitution or the statute underpinning UNHCR), UNRWA has no separate founding constitution. Its mandate, scope and institutional arrangements are defined and renewed primarily through General Assembly resolutions.
- The agency is technically temporary in character: the GA renews (and modifies) UNRWA’s mandate at regular intervals—commonly on a three‑year cycle—while annual resolutions address budgets and programme specifics. That renewal rhythm is central to the agency’s legal identity and to the operational uncertainties it entails.
- Because UNRWA reports directly to the General Assembly, its political accountability flows to member states through that forum; this direct GA linkage is a source of legitimacy but also of politicisation, particularly given the Israeli–Palestinian conflict’s salience in the Assembly.

Governance, leadership and staffing
- UNRWA is led by a Commissioner‑General who holds the rank of Under‑Secretary‑General and is responsible for the overall management of the agency, its policies and its personnel. The incumbent named in the source text is Philippe Lazzarini (appointed 8 March 2020). A Deputy Commissioner‑General supports management, with the text identifying Leni Stenseth (Norway) in that role; senior leadership administers departmental portfolios such as education, health and finance.
- Under UNRWA’s internal rules, the Commissioner‑General has authority to select and appoint agency staff. Staff recruitment is overwhelmingly local: historically the agency has employed more than 30,000 staff with an extremely high proportion recruited from the Palestinian population in the fields of operation (the source flagged the “99% locally recruited” figure as requiring updating). This composition is operationally advantageous for local knowledge and continuity but is also politically sensitive in contested environments.
- The agency’s headquarters functions are split between Amman (Jordan) and the Gaza Strip in practice; field administration and programmatic leadership, however, are delegated to field directors.

Field architecture and operations
- Operationally UNRWA is organised into five fields: Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza. Each field is headed by a director who administers the distribution of humanitarian aid, education and health services, social safety nets and other UNRWA programmes in that territory.
- This field-based architecture gives UNRWA strong local presence and programme depth, but also exposes operations to the security, political and legal constraints of five very different host-state and occupation contexts.

Mandate scope and beneficiary definition
- UNRWA’s beneficiaries are defined narrowly and institutionally: assistance is limited to registered Palestine refugees and their descendants as established by the Agency’s mandate. That delimitation—by lineage and registration—differs markedly from UNHCR’s broader, cross‑national refugee remit and underpins much of the debate about UNRWA’s role and longevity.
- The narrower beneficiary universe produces clear operational advantages (targeted services, institutional continuity) and disadvantages (questions about long‑term solutions, demographic politics and the perpetuation of dependency).

Financing, independence and politicisation
- UNRWA’s budget is overwhelmingly financed through voluntary contributions from UN member states and other donors. This funding modality renders the agency vulnerable to donor shortfalls and to the policy preferences or political conditionalities of major contributors.
- The three‑year mandate renewal cycle, together with annual budgetary approvals, creates recurrent strategic and operational uncertainty. Long‑term planning, staff contracts and capital investments are complicated by the prospect of political contestation at the GA and by fluctuating donor commitments.
- The direct reporting relationship to the General Assembly gives member states a clear leverage point, but also means that UNRWA’s mandate and operations are a frequent subject of political contestation in multilateral fora. That dynamic both reflects and intensifies the politicisation of humanitarian assistance in the Israeli–Palestinian context.

Operational challenges and accountability mechanisms
- Over its history, UNRWA has confronted recurrent operational challenges: cyclical funding gaps, attacks and security incidents affecting staff and installations, and sustained scrutiny concerning neutrality, oversight and administrative practices.
- Accountability channels include formal reporting to the General Assembly, adherence to internal rules governing staff appointments and conduct, and periodic external audits or UN system oversight reviews. Nevertheless, the combination of heavy donor dependence and direct political oversight in the GA can complicate impartial review and consistent follow‑through on remedial measures.
- The high proportion of locally recruited staff is an operational strength—ensuring local expertise and continuity—but in highly politicised environments it has also been invoked in critiques alleging partiality. Managing the perception as well as the fact of neutrality is therefore a recurring governance challenge.

Comparative note and implications
- Institutionally UNRWA is unique within the UN system: its GA‑created, resolution‑driven mandate, its beneficiary definition by registration and descent, and its operational footprint in multiple host jurisdictions set it apart from treaty‑based agencies and from UNHCR’s global refugee framework.
- For states that engage in humanitarian diplomacy and multilateral security affairs—including India—the UNRWA case offers several lessons: the importance of clear legal foundations for mandate longevity; the operational trade‑offs between localized staffing and perceived impartiality; the strategic risks associated with voluntary funding dependence; and the ways in which mandates that are repeatedly renewed by political bodies can be both durable and deeply politicised.

Conclusion
UNRWA exemplifies how institutional design shapes operational possibilities and political vulnerabilities. Its GA‑rooted mandate and field architecture enable extensive local engagement with refugee populations across several jurisdictions, but the same features make the agency particularly sensitive to donor pressures and political contestation. For policymakers and analysts concerned with national security and strategic culture—India’s included—the UNRWA experience underscores the need to align legal clarity, stable financing and robust accountability if humanitarian agencies are to deliver predictable assistance in protracted and politicised crises.

## Advisory Commission (AdCom)

Origin and mandate
- The United Nations General Assembly established the Advisory Commission (AdCom) at the same time it created the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Its express purpose was to assist the Commissioner‑General in carrying out UNRWA’s humanitarian, relief and human‑development mandate. From its inception AdCom has been an advisory and oversight body: it provides political guidance and strategic oversight but does not execute or manage UNRWA operations—that remains the responsibility of the Commissioner‑General and UNRWA management.

Composition and membership
- AdCom began with only four members, but over time its membership has expanded significantly. It now comprises 28 members and 4 observers, with membership determined by resolutions of the UN General Assembly. The configuration intentionally combines operational stake (host states) and financial stake (major donors) so that both those hosting Palestinian refugees and those providing funds are institutionally represented in UNRWA’s advisory architecture.
- Permanent representation is guaranteed to the three host countries of the principal Palestinian refugee populations: Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The rest of the membership is drawn from the 24 leading donors and supporters of UNRWA, reflecting the centrality of funding in shaping the Agency’s activities and priorities.
- The expansion from 4 to 28 members signals the progressive internationalization—and to some degree the politicization—of UNRWA oversight. Because membership is set by UNGA resolution, changes to the roster are themselves politically consequential and track shifts in international support.

Full list of AdCom members (year joined)
- Founding members (1949): Egypt, France, Jordan, Syria, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States.
- Early additions: Belgium (1953), Lebanon (1953), Japan (1973).
- Large expansion cohort (2005): Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland (all joined 2005).
- Subsequent additions: Finland (2008), Ireland (2008), Kuwait (2010), Luxembourg (2012), Kazakhstan (2013), Brazil (2014), United Arab Emirates (2014), Qatar (2018).

Observers
- Observer status permits regional and multilateral bodies to participate in AdCom deliberations without full voting membership. Since 2005 Palestine, the European Union and the League of Arab States have served as observers. In 2019 the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was added as an observer. Observer participation allows coordinated regional engagement and amplifies collective diplomatic signals while avoiding the procedural complications of full membership.

Leadership, rules and procedures
- AdCom’s leadership consists of a chair and a vice‑chair. By convention and rule, one of these posts represents a host country and the other represents a donor country. Appointments are made annually in June, take effect on 1 July, and last for one year.
- Leadership appointments follow an alphabetical rotation among Commission members and alternate between a host and a donor country. This procedural design seeks to produce a predictable, equitable distribution of influence across different categories of stakeholders and to reduce contestation over short‑term leadership slots.
- Meetings are held twice a year—typically in June and November—at which AdCom discusses major UNRWA issues and develops consensus‑based guidance for the Commissioner‑General. To handle specific portfolios or technical matters, members and observers form sub‑committees that meet more frequently.

Functions in practice: meetings, sub‑committees and field visits
- AdCom’s twice‑yearly plenaries are the principal fora for political guidance and coordinated donor messaging. Decisions are generally reached through consensus, which means outcomes are the product of diplomatic negotiation among a diverse set of members with differing priorities.
- Sub‑committees allow for more regular engagement and technical scrutiny of UNRWA finance, programme delivery, safeguarding, and other operational concerns.
- Importantly, AdCom undertakes periodic field visits to UNRWA areas of operation. These on‑the‑ground missions serve several functions: they provide direct oversight and verification of needs and programme implementation, enable needs assessment, and build donor confidence through firsthand exposure to conditions in the field.

Limits of authority and practical implications
- As an advisory organ, AdCom cannot direct UNRWA’s day‑to‑day operations. Its influence is political and normative—shaping strategy, priorities, and donor expectations—rather than managerial. This division preserves operational independence for UNRWA management while creating structured political oversight.
- The joint presence of host states and principal donors in AdCom means that funding considerations and operational realities are brought into close conversation. That mix inevitably shapes policy priorities and can produce formal or informal conditionalities on funding and programmatic directions.

Strategic and political significance (relevance for national strategic culture)
- The structure and practice of AdCom illustrate how international organizations embed state interests within governance mechanisms. The host‑plus‑donor composition is a deliberate institutional design that balances operational legitimacy (hosts) against resource control (donors). For states crafting a strategic approach to multilateral engagement, AdCom is a case study in how representation, voting power (or its absence), and informal practices (e.g., field visits, consensus politics) translate into influence.
- For countries considering deeper engagement—whether as donors, prospective members, or observers—the AdCom model signals what kinds of leverage are available (financial contributions, chairmanship, technical sub‑committee leadership) and what trade‑offs may arise (politicization of humanitarian mandates, expectations of influence over programme design).
- Procedural devices such as annual alphabetical rotation and alternating host/donor leadership are tools for procedural fairness that help contain rivalry; consensus decision‑making encourages diplomacy but can also dilute decisiveness when members’ interests diverge.
- Finally, the evolution of AdCom—from a small founding group to a broad, regionally varied body—reflects the broader dynamics of UN governance: as issues become more geopolitically salient, oversight bodies expand and become arenas of political contestation as much as technical governance.

Concluding note
- The AdCom exemplifies how multilateral advisory mechanisms function at the interface of humanitarian operational needs and interstate politics. Its design—permanent host representation, donor membership, observer participation, rotational leadership and consensus practice—offers a concise lesson in the institutional balancing acts that shape the governance of politically charged humanitarian agencies. For analysts of national strategic culture, including policymakers in India, AdCom’s architecture underscores both opportunities for influence through multilateral engagement and the constraints imposed by collective decision‑making.

## Areas of operation

This section summarizes the geographic scope, beneficiary base, legal footing, operational limits and practical challenges that define the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Understanding these contours is essential for situating UNRWA within broader debates about humanitarian governance, host‑state sovereignty and donor diplomacy — issues that bear directly on the strategic considerations of external actors, including India.

### Scope and beneficiaries
- UNRWA’s services are available to persons registered as Palestine refugees who live within the agency’s area of operations and who require assistance. Registration with UNRWA is therefore the primary determinant of eligibility for its services.
- The agency began operations in 1950 in response to roughly 700,000 Palestine refugees displaced after the 1948 war. By 2023, UNRWA’s registry recorded approximately 5.9 million people as eligible for its services — a growth that reflects generations of displacement, demographic change and expanding registration rather than recurrent mass new displacements alone.
- A commonly quoted statistic states that around one‑third of registered Palestine refugees live in recognized refugee camps; this assertion appears in many secondary sources but is often flagged internally as requiring verification (citation needed). If accurate, the figure implies that roughly two‑thirds of registered refugees live outside camp settings and therefore depend on dispersed service provision.

### Geographic footprint and the recognized camps
- UNRWA maintains a presence in five areas: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. These territories together contain the 59 locations usually described as UNRWA’s “recognized refugee camps.”
- Recognition of a site as a refugee camp in UNRWA terminology is not unilateral: it requires a formal understanding between UNRWA and the host government that governs how the site will be used and what jurisdictional arrangements apply. Such formal host‑government agreements significantly shape UNRWA’s legal and operational footprint in each camp.

### UNRWA’s mandate within camps: services, not governance
- It is a core principle of UNRWA operations that the agency provides services rather than governs. UNRWA does not “run” the camps in the sense of administering civil affairs, exercising policing powers, or holding formal administrative authority over camp residents.
- The agency’s responsibilities are therefore concentrated on service delivery — education, primary health care, social services, emergency assistance and certain infrastructure — while governance, security, land and municipal functions remain with host authorities or other local actors.

### Transformation of camp environments and dispersed operations
- Many camp sites have evolved dramatically since 1950: what began as tented emergency settlements have in many instances become dense urban neighbourhoods indistinguishable in built form from surrounding cities. This urbanization complicates service delivery (e.g., infrastructure, overcrowding, public health) and blurs the lines between “camp” and “non‑camp” populations.
- Because a substantial share of registered refugees live outside recognized camps, UNRWA must balance concentrated service provision in camp settings with decentralized programming across urban and rural contexts. This dual mode of operation raises logistical, legal and cost‑management challenges for the agency.

### Operational constraints and challenges
- Dependence on voluntary funding: UNRWA is overwhelmingly financed by voluntary contributions from states and institutions. This funding model introduces uncertainty and periodic shortfalls that affect continuity and scale of services.
- Host‑state policies and local governance: UNRWA’s mandate and the modalities of its work are shaped by the policies of host governments and by local administrative structures. Variations in host‑government willingness to cooperate, differing legal frameworks and political sensitivities affect access, programming choices and the scope of permissible activities.
- Conflict and access risks: In conflict zones such as Gaza and parts of Syria, security constraints, targeting risks, infrastructure damage and humanitarian access restrictions create acute operational challenges and recurring emergency burdens for UNRWA.

### Data reliability and verification
- Statistical claims about registration and living arrangements (for example, the “one‑third in camps” figure) are widely cited but sometimes appear with caveats or “citation needed” tags in secondary syntheses. Researchers and policy analysts should treat headline numbers as indicative but verify them against primary UNRWA reports and the agency’s registry data when precision is required.

### Strategic implications for India
- For Indian strategic and security planners, UNRWA’s operational profile matters in several ways:
  - Donor diplomacy: UNRWA’s dependence on voluntary funding makes it a locus of international diplomacy. India’s contributions, public posture and multilateral engagement with UNRWA are instruments of foreign policy and humanitarian statecraft.
  - Refugee policy and comparative practice: UNRWA’s experience — particularly the distinction between camp‑based and urban service delivery, and the legal/operational consequences of host‑government agreements — offers comparative lessons for India’s own handling of prolonged displacement (whether domestically or in regional engagements).
  - Regional stability and conflict spillover: The humanitarian conditions in UNRWA’s areas of operation are factors in regional dynamics; disruptions can generate refugee flows, radicalization risks, and interstate tensions that have broader security implications.
  - Operational learning: India’s peacekeeping and disaster‑relief forces can draw operational lessons from UNRWA’s service models, access negotiations and civil‑military coordination in protracted displacement environments.

Concluding remark: UNRWA’s areas of operation illustrate the hybrid, negotiated character of modern humanitarian governance — bounded by host‑state arrangements, constrained by funding and security realities, and transformed by the long‑term urbanization of displacement. For external states, including India, engagement with UNRWA is simultaneously a humanitarian act and a strategic choice that can influence regional stability, diplomatic standing and operational learning.

## UNRWA’s Funding Architecture, Donor Politics, and Strategic Implications

Summary
- The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) operates on a financing model that combines a General Assembly‑set budgetary framework with overwhelmingly voluntary contributions from states and non‑state actors. That model produces recurrent instability: large, politically‑driven donor decisions (suspensions, restorations, earmarking) have repeatedly generated multi‑hundred‑million‑dollar gaps, with direct consequences for programme delivery in education, health, social services and emergency relief. This section maps UNRWA’s funding structure, traces major historical crises to 2024, identifies political drivers of contribution changes, and draws out the programmatic and strategic risks — concluding with policy recommendations and a brief analytic note on relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Funding architecture and revenue streams
- Budget setting: UNRWA’s overall programme budgets are endorsed within the UN system via the General Assembly processes that determine the agency’s mandate and recommended budget levels.
- Voluntary contributions: The agency’s operating revenues derive almost entirely from voluntary contributions by UN member states, regional institutions and private donors. This is the defining feature of UNRWA’s financing model and its principal vulnerability.
- Regular UN budget linkage: UNRWA receives a limited contribution from the regular UN budget, mainly to defray costs associated with international staff and certain internationally‑mandated obligations; this is not sufficient to cover operational core costs.
- Emergency and project‑specific financing: Beyond core funding, UNRWA solicits and obtains episodic emergency funding and project‑specific grants (for example, responses to the Syria civil war and COVID‑19). These emergency inflows are important but unpredictable and usually cannot substitute for recurring core financing.
- National committees and NGOs: UNRWA also benefits from national non‑profit “national committees” and private philanthropic partners that provide smaller, relatively flexible grants and public advocacy support.

2. Major donors and typical concentration
- Historically dominant funders: The United States and the European Union (institutions and member states collectively) have been principal sources of UNRWA funding.
- 2019 snapshot: Roughly 60% of UNRWA’s pledged ~$1 billion in 2019 came from EU member states and EU institutions; Germany was the largest individual donor that year. Other top contributors included the United Kingdom, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Qatar and the Netherlands.
- Other important channels: Gulf states (e.g., Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia) and Japan frequently provide substantial bilateral and project‑based support, including targeted Syria‑related financing.
- Donor diversity: While several states are consistently significant, no single source (post‑2018 U.S. cuts aside) fully insulates UNRWA from shocks; national committees and NGOs provide useful but comparatively modest buffers.

3. Historical funding crises, suspensions and donor responses (selected events)
- 2009 Gaza crisis: Following an Israeli offensive in Gaza UNRWA described a “dire financial crisis” producing a roughly $200 million shortfall.
- January 2010 — Canada: Canada redirected funds previously earmarked for UNRWA to Palestinian Authority projects (Canada had earlier contributed amounts on the order of CAD $10 million annually, roughly 11% of UNRWA’s budget at the time).
- August 2018 — U.S. cessation: The United States announced a cessation of contributions to UNRWA, arguing the agency’s mandate should be narrowed to Palestinians who were alive when UNRWA was established in 1949. The U.S. decision removed approximately $300 million from a ~$1.2 billion budget and contributed to an overall UNRWA deficit reported at $446 million that year.
- Mid‑2019 — ethics suspensions: The Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland temporarily suspended funding after an internal ethics review alleged mismanagement, corruption and discrimination within UNRWA leadership.
- December 2019 — restoration and replenishment: The Netherlands restored and increased its funding by €6 million (to €19 million); the EU increased contributions by €21 million and Germany committed €59 million to four new projects. Qatar augmented its Syria‑related contribution by $20.7 million in 2019 (bringing its Syria total to $40 million).
- April and September 2019 — donor diplomacy: Donors convened a “Ministerial Strategic Dialogue” (April) and a high‑level ministerial meeting on UNRWA funding during the UN General Assembly in 2019 to coordinate responses and reassure the agency.
- July 2020 — sustainability warning: Commissioner‑General Philippe Lazzarini warned that repeated shortfalls left UNRWA’s budget “not sustainable,” at funding levels the agency had not seen since 2012.
- 2012 World Bank observation: The World Bank noted that in 2012 Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank received unusually high per capita international aid ($495), reflecting both humanitarian need and concentrated political attention.
- 2023 media context: Commissioner‑General Lazzarini met U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Amman on 4 November 2023 — an example of senior diplomatic engagement on UNRWA’s future.
- 2024 disruptions: The EU briefly suspended funding in January 2024 but reinstated it on 1 March 2024. In 2024 the Swiss National Council voted to cut funding citing concerns about alleged links to antisemitism and terrorism; the measure requires approval by the Council of States to take effect.

4. Political drivers behind contribution changes
- Geopolitical contests and mandate debates: Large funding changes often reflect political disputes about UNRWA’s mandate, population definitions and the broader Israeli–Palestinian political context — debates that translate directly into legislative and executive choices in donor capitals.
- Domestic politics and fiscal prioritization: Economic cycles and domestic political considerations (electoral politics, budget tightening) condition a donor’s willingness to sustain voluntary overseas commitments.
- Governance and accountability triggers: Ethics findings, allegations of mismanagement or staff misconduct have, at times, produced immediate suspensions by multiple donors, irrespective of the wider geopolitical frame.
- Leverage through voluntary funding: Because financing is voluntary, donors possess outsized leverage to press administrative reforms, mandate adjustments or policy statements through conditionality and suspension threats.

5. Consequences for programme delivery and operational stability
- Rapid fiscal shocks: Large single‑donor withdrawals (notably the 2018 U.S. cut) can erase hundreds of millions of dollars of planned revenues in a short period, forcing urgent budget reallocations or service reductions.
- Erosion of core services: Recurrent shortfalls threaten UNRWA’s core programmes — education (schools and teachers), primary health services, social safety nets, camp infrastructure, and emergency relief — with direct humanitarian consequences for refugees.
- Emergency funding insufficiency: Spikes in emergency/project finance typically arrive with delay, are earmarked, and are insufficiently predictable to replace lost core funding or prevent staff layoffs.
- Accountability and reputational cycles: Allegations of mismanagement produce donor suspensions that, even when later rectified, can create cycles of reputational damage leading to conservative donor behaviour.

6. Patterns of donor behaviour and restoration dynamics
- Negotiated restorations: Funding restorations have frequently followed diplomatic negotiations, confidence‑building measures, and commitments to strengthen governance (for example, the December 2019 funding recoveries).
- Legislative pathways and conditionality: National parliamentary votes (e.g., the Swiss National Council) can introduce new conditionality or legal review processes that lengthen uncertainty; multi‑chamber systems mean that funding cuts are sometimes reversible or delayed.
- Small‑scale flexibility: National committees and NGOs provide flexible, quick‑disbursing support but cannot substitute for state‑level core financing at scale.
- Donor coordination forums: Periodic ministerial dialogues and UN‑hosted replenishment discussions have become important mechanisms to coordinate pledges and to provide political cover for donors to increase contributions.

7. Funding risks, structural implications and policy recommendations
Risks and implications
- Political vulnerability: Heavy reliance on voluntary contributions links UNRWA’s operational stability to donor politics and exposes refugees to the consequences of diplomatic dispute.
- Programme fragility: Persistent deficits place education, health and protection services at risk, with multiplier effects across Palestinian society.
- Accountability paradox: While governance reforms are necessary to maintain donor confidence, overly prescriptive conditionality risks impeding the agency’s operational agility in emergencies.

Recommendations
- Stabilize core financing: Seek more predictable, multi‑year core funding arrangements (pooled funds, standby commitments) to reduce exposure to abrupt cuts.
- Enhance transparency and independent audits: Institutionalize independent external auditing, public reporting and a strengthened ethics function to reduce the political salience of misconduct allegations and to rebuild donor trust.
- Improve donor coordination: Regular strategic dialogues with major donors, regional states and national committees can help smooth episodic shortfalls and align emergency financing with core needs.
- Diversify revenue base: Expand partnerships with middle‑income donors, philanthropic foundations, and multilateral development banks for longer‑term infrastructure and social‑service financing.
- Protect essential services from earmarking: Advocate for a greater share of unearmarked funds that preserve managerial flexibility and sustain education and health programmes.

8. Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Multilateralism and principled independence: India’s strategic culture — with its emphasis on principled multilateral engagement, strategic autonomy and a preference for non‑politicized humanitarian action — suggests a natural inclination to support predictable, apolitical financing mechanisms for UN agencies providing essential services.
- Lessons for Indian policy:
  - Risk awareness: India’s own contributions to UN operations and peacekeeping suggest recognition that voluntary financing models create leverage for donor politics; this argues for India to favour reforms that increase predictability and accountability in multilateral funding.
  - Pragmatic engagement: India can play a constructive role in donor coordination forums (UNGA, ECOSOC) pressing for multi‑year commitments, transparency measures and targeted capacity‑building for agencies like UNRWA.
  - Diplomatic balancing: India’s relations with Gulf states (major UNRWA donors), the EU and the United States mean New Delhi can act as a bridge — advocating both for stable humanitarian financing and for governance reforms that are operationally constructive rather than purely punitive.
  - Domestic political economy: Given India’s own sensitivities to domestic political opinion on issues related to West Asia, Indian policymakers must calibrate contributions and public statements so as to preserve strategic relationships without undermining multilateral humanitarian norms.
- Strategic opportunity: By combining financial contributions (bilateral and multilateral), technical assistance (education/health systems strengthening), and principled advocacy for transparent, sustainable funding, India can reinforce a rules‑based multilateralism while safeguarding the humanitarian lifelines that underwrite regional stability.

Conclusion
- UNRWA’s funding story is a cautionary case about the fragility of voluntary financing for institutions with long‑term social obligations. Political decisions in donor capitals, ethical controversies and episodic emergencies have combined to produce recurrent instability with practical consequences for millions of Palestinian refugees. For states like India that prize stable multilateral institutions and seek to avoid the securitization of humanitarian assistance, the UNRWA experience underscores the strategic value of predictable financing, rigorous accountability, and calibrated diplomatic engagement to protect service delivery from partisan politics.

### UNRWA operations and budget allocation (through 2019): mandate, practice and policy implications

Overview  
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) illustrates how an international agency’s political mandate and donor environment shape long-term operational choices. Established in 1949 to respond to the immediate humanitarian needs of Palestinian refugees, UNRWA has, over seven decades, transformed into a sustained social-service provider across multiple host territories. Its program priorities and resource allocation are not purely technical decisions made within the agency; they are anchored in United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) resolutions and shaped by donor preferences and political constraints. The 2019 budgetary allocations offer a clear window into these choices and their implications for operational capacity and regional stability.

Founding mandate and evolution
- Creation and mandate: UNRWA was established by the UNGA in 1949 to provide relief and works programmes for Palestinian refugees displaced in the 1948 Arab–Israeli conflict. The scope of its mandate—and any subsequent changes—has been set through UNGA decisions, reflecting political consensus (or compromise) among member states rather than unilateral agency discretion.
- From relief to services: Although conceived as a short-term relief agency, UNRWA’s activities expanded over time from emergency assistance to ongoing social services (notably education and primary health). This institutional evolution arose from prolonged displacement, host-state arrangements, and recurrent crises that made temporary solutions untenable.
- Geographic focus: UNRWA’s operational theatre comprises five areas—Jordan, Lebanon, the Syrian Arab Republic, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip—each with distinctive host-state constraints and humanitarian-political dynamics.

Scope of services (operational modalities)
- Education: UNRWA runs extensive primary and secondary school networks, along with vocational and teacher-training programmes. Education is delivered at scale through school facilities, curricula adapted to local conditions, and large numbers of teaching staff recruited regionally.
- Health: Health services emphasize primary healthcare—maternal and child health, immunization, chronic disease management and basic referral services—operated through clinic networks in refugee camps and host communities.
- General support: This category encompasses administration, logistics, infrastructure maintenance (school and clinic buildings, water and sanitation in camps), salary costs for staff, and core programme management functions.
- Other activities: UNRWA also undertakes emergency response, distribution of relief supplies, camp improvement projects, microcredit and livelihood programmes, and psychosocial support depending on acute needs.

2019 budget snapshot and what it signals
- Budget distribution (2019): Education—58%; Health—15%; General support services—13%. These three categories total 86% of the 2019 budget; the remaining ~14% funds other activities (emergency response, relief supplies, camp infrastructure, livelihood/microprograms, etc.).
- Interpretation:
  - Heavy investment in education (58%) signals a strategic, long-term approach: treating schooling as an investment in human capital and social stability rather than a narrow short-term relief expense.
  - Health’s 15% reflects sustained primary-care service delivery, essential for population well-being but less resource-intensive than the large-scale school system.
  - General support at 13% indicates substantial fixed costs associated with administering a geographically dispersed operation—payroll, logistics, facility upkeep—which together enable frontline service delivery.
  - The unspecified ~14% provides operational flexibility for emergencies, camp rehabilitation and smaller targeted programmes; its relative size points to limited discretionary reserves.

Operational consequences and capacity concentration
- Staffing and infrastructure: The budgetary emphasis on education concentrates staffing and infrastructure in schools—large numbers of teachers, school administrators and school buildings—creating institutional and political linkages between UNRWA and host communities.
- Programmatic focus: Allocation patterns shape programme priorities and institutional expertise: large-scale schooling systems foster capabilities in pedagogy and youth services; relatively smaller health allocations prioritize primary-care competencies.
- Vulnerability to shocks: Because UNRWA is donor-dependent, budget lines are sensitive to political shifts among major contributors. Reductions in funding can force cutbacks disproportionately in those services that consume the largest shares (education and support), with immediate social repercussions.

Political economy, accountability and transparency
- Donor dependence and political leverage: UNRWA’s funding model—reliant on voluntary contributions from UN member states and other donors—creates exposure to donor political priorities and conditionalities. This dynamic can affect program continuity and the balance between core services and emergency response.
- Transparency and auditing: Given UNRWA’s politically sensitive mandate, rigorous financial transparency and independent auditing are essential for donor confidence, operational legitimacy and resilience in contested environments.
- Mandate-driven constraints: Because program scope is shaped by UNGA resolutions, UNRWA sometimes faces tensions between humanitarian neutrality, political contestation over refugee status and the practical needs of long-term service delivery.

Contextual caveats (2019 as a baseline)
- Pre‑2019 snapshot: The 2019 budget composition predates major subsequent developments—COVID-19, renewed hostilities, large displacements and shifting donor policies—that have likely altered needs and allocations. Thus the 2019 picture is best read as a structural baseline rather than a static projection.
- Unspecified allocations: The roughly 14% of the budget outside the three major categories likely covers emergency response, relief supplies, camp infrastructure projects and livelihood programmes—items that expand and contract with crises.

Implications for strategic practitioners (relevance to national security and policy)
- Long-term social services as stabilizers: UNRWA’s prioritization of education illustrates how sustained social-service delivery by international agencies can contribute to social stability in protracted displacement settings—an insight relevant to national security planners who must consider humanitarian dimensions of regional stability.
- Donor policy and operational resilience: Reliance on voluntary funding underscores the need for diversified and predictable financing to sustain services that reduce long-term insecurity risks. For states engaging in regional humanitarian policy (including India), investments in predictability and accountability can enhance the stabilizing impact of humanitarian actors.
- Institutional design and political mandates: The case shows how political mandates (UNGA-driven) can lock agencies into specific roles that evolve beyond initial expectations. Policymakers should anticipate these institutional path-dependencies when designing cooperative or supportive engagements with such agencies.

Conclusion
UNRWA through 2019 demonstrates the interplay between political mandate, donor politics and programmatic choices. The dominance of education in its budget reflects a deliberate, long-term strategy of human-capital investment in a context of protracted displacement; health and administrative costs sustain the delivery apparatus; and a small discretionary margin covers episodic emergencies. For scholars and practitioners of strategic culture and national security, UNRWA is a useful case of how international organizations can influence local stability, how funding modalities affect operational resilience, and why transparency and predictable financing are critical when humanitarian action intersects with geopolitics.

## UNRWA’s Education Programme: Scale, Structure, Operational Challenges and Strategic Implications

This section examines the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) education programme—its scale, institutional design, pedagogical arrangements, and the operational stresses that shape its efficacy. While UNRWA operates in a distinct Middle Eastern refugee context, its experience offers analytically useful lessons for thinking about how education programmes for displaced populations intersect with state sovereignty, social stability and national-security considerations. The analysis below synthesizes institutional facts, operational realities and their implications for policy and strategic culture.

### Scope and institutional footprint
- Education is UNRWA’s largest single activity: it consumes more than half of the Agency’s regular budget and employs the majority of its workforce. This prioritization makes education both a centrepiece of UNRWA’s mandate and a budgetary vulnerability: funding shortfalls disproportionately affect the Agency’s most visible public service.
- UNRWA manages one of the region’s largest school systems: 711 elementary and preparatory schools, eight vocational and technical schools, and two teacher‑training institutes. The system provides free basic education to all registered Palestine refugee children—approximately 526,000 students.

### Demographics and demand
- The Palestine refugee population is demographically young (about half are under 25). This age structure sustains a persistent and large demand for schooling and post‑basic educational services, placing recurrent pressure on infrastructure and human resources.
- Gender parity is a notable institutional achievement: UNRWA schools reached full gender equality in the 1960s and today enroll slightly more girls than boys. Sustaining parity, however, depends on addressing socio‑economic and security barriers that can reverse gains.

### Pedagogical alignment and legal-political framing
- By longstanding agreement with host states, UNRWA follows the host-country curriculum in each area of operation. This approach serves multiple purposes:
  - It respects state sovereignty and facilitates political acceptability.
  - It allows UNRWA students, where feasible, to sit national examinations administered by host governments and to obtain nationally recognised qualifications—thus preserving pathways to higher education and local labour markets.
- This alignment also exposes UNRWA to policy changes within host countries: changes in curricula, examination regimes or recognition rules are exogenous risks to the continuity and value of refugee students’ educational credentials.

### Operational challenges affecting learning
- Overcrowding: classrooms commonly hold 40–50 pupils. High pupil density undermines individualised instruction, classroom management and pedagogical innovation.
- Double-shift systems: roughly three‑quarters of UNRWA schools operate on double shifts (morning and afternoon cohorts). While this expands access within scarce physical infrastructure, it reduces instructional time per pupil and places additional strain on teachers and facilities.
- Conflict interruptions: recurrent episodes of armed conflict and political unrest disrupt the school year. In response, UNRWA developed an Education-in-Emergencies (EiE) programme to maintain continuity and provide remedial support.

### Education-in-Emergencies (EiE): programming priorities
- EiE work requires a portfolio of complementary measures:
  - Flexible, condensed curricula and accelerated-learning or catch-up programmes to recover missed instructional time.
  - Psychosocial support and trauma-informed pedagogy to address the mental-health effects of conflict on learning readiness.
  - Alternative delivery modalities (temporary learning spaces, community-based education, radio/remote lessons) to sustain access during insecurity.
  - Rapid teacher training on emergency pedagogy and child protection.
- Effective EiE presupposes contingency financing and operational agility—both areas where UNRWA’s heavy reliance on voluntary funding can impede rapid scale‑up.

### Human resources and quality assurance
- The presence of two teacher‑training institutes is strategically important: sustained professional development is essential to maintain quality in conditions of overcrowding, double shifts and recurrent disruption.
- Monitoring systems should prioritise indicators that reflect both access and learning: pupil‑teacher ratios, completion and dropout rates, learning outcomes (including national exam performance where available), and psychosocial indicators.
- The double‑shift model and overcrowding mean that standard quality inputs (e.g., curriculum hours, formative assessment) must be adapted and measured with context‑sensitive benchmarks.

### Risks and vulnerabilities
- Financial fragility: with education absorbing over half the regular budget, funding volatility poses acute risks—programme contraction would have immediate social and political consequences.
- Political/institutional risk: host‑country policy shifts, changes in exam recognition, or security-related access restrictions can rapidly alter the educational prospects of refugee students.
- Operational risk: teacher burnout, infrastructure degradation and recurrent interruptions compound to reduce learning efficacy over time.

### Strategic lessons and policy implications (for states and strategists)
- Legitimacy through integration: UNRWA’s practice of following host curricula demonstrates a pragmatic model for combining humanitarian provision with respect for state sovereignty—an approach that reduces friction and preserves students’ legal pathways into national systems.
- Education as stabilization: large-scale education provision for refugee populations is not merely humanitarian; it is a stabilizing public good. Sustained access to recognised schooling reduces marginalisation, supports social cohesion and lowers the long‑term security risks of alienated youth cohorts.
- Preparedness and contingency finance: durable EiE capacity requires predictable funding and pre‑positioned contingencies. Strategic planners should view refugee education funding as part of regional stability budgets rather than ad hoc humanitarian spending.
- Human capital and strategic leverage: maintaining credential recognition (via host examinations and curricula) protects refugees’ future labour-market integration—an outcome that matters both for refugees’ welfare and for host‑state social stability.

Conclusion
UNRWA’s education system is a large, politically embedded public service that illustrates the nexus between humanitarian provision, state sovereignty and regional stability. Its operational constraints—overcrowding, double shifts, funding volatility and conflict interruptions—reduce learning effectiveness even as demographic pressures sustain demand. For policymakers concerned with strategic stability, the core lesson is that refugee education must be conceived as both a humanitarian imperative and a component of broader security and integration strategies: curricula alignment, teacher training, robust monitoring and contingency financing are essential to convert schooling access into durable social and political dividends.

## Case study: UNRWA’s social protection interventions — services, targeting and community partnerships

Context and visual record
- A widely circulated archival image — captioned “Women receiving bread from United Nations Relief for Palestine Refugees (UNRPR), 1948” — foregrounds the long-standing humanitarian role played by the UN system in Palestine and acts as an historical antecedent to the present United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). That lineage is important for understanding how relief institutions evolve from emergency provisioning to sustained social-service architectures.

Mandate and modalities of assistance
- UNRWA’s mandate extends beyond immediate relief to sustained delivery of education, health and social services for Palestinian refugees. Within its social protection portfolio, the Agency combines short-term relief with targeted social interventions:
  - Food assistance for the most vulnerable refugee families.
  - Cash transfers and cash-based assistance to meet basic needs and to preserve household consumption.
  - Shelter-repair support for physically damaged dwellings, a critical intervention that reduces exposure and secondary displacement.
  - Targeted vocational training and social programmes aimed at longer-term economic inclusion.

Targeting “hardship cases” and gendered vulnerability
- UNRWA explicitly identifies a subcategory of beneficiaries as “hardship cases” — households with elevated, persistent vulnerability that require specially tailored assistance. Two important features characterize this targeting:
  - Scale: Hardship cases account for a small proportion of beneficiaries (reported at under 6%), indicating very targeted, high-need programming rather than broad-based subsidies.
  - Composition and drivers of vulnerability: Within Palestinian refugee society, households without a male head — for example, widows, divorcees or families with disabled fathers — are often disproportionately vulnerable. Such households frequently live in dire poverty and face structural barriers (economic exclusion, reduced access to employment, social protection gaps and protection risks).
- Programmatically, children from these hardship households are given preferential access to vocational training centres; this is a deliberate attempt to break intergenerational cycles of poverty through skills and labour-market access.

Women’s programmes and enabling participation
- UNRWA’s women’s programme centres perform multiple, complementary functions:
  - Skills training: vocational and livelihoods training designed for local labour-market realities.
  - Social and technical advice: counselling and practical guidance that may range from business skills to social support networks.
  - Childcare provision: on-site childcare reduces a major barrier to women’s participation in training and social activities, thereby enhancing uptake and effectiveness.
- Encouragement and outreach to women from hardship households is an explicit policy lever, recognizing that inclusion of female-headed families requires both material support and social facilitation.

Community-based organisations (CBOs): structure, support and networks
- UNRWA has promoted a network of community-based organisations to respond to locally defined needs, with an emphasis on women, refugees with disabilities and children. Key features include:
  - Local governance: CBOs are typically managed by committees of community volunteers, which builds local ownership and social accountability.
  - Agency support: UNRWA provides technical assistance and small, targeted financial grants to CBOs — support calibrated to catalyse activity rather than to fully underwrite sustained operating budgets.
  - External partnerships: many CBOs have formed links with local and international non-governmental organisations, diversifying resources and technical expertise.
- These linkages enhance reach and innovation but raise classic coordination and accountability issues: volunteer-led management can strengthen legitimacy but may also limit scale, professional capacity and financial sustainability.

Programmatic strengths and limitations — analytical observations
- Complementarity of short- and medium-term measures: Shelter repairs, food and cash transfers address immediate risk and stabilize livelihoods. Vocational training and women’s centres invest in medium-term resilience. The combination reflects a mixed humanitarian-development approach.
- Targeting trade-offs: High targeting (hardship cases <6%) increases efficiency in scarce-resource environments but risks missing households with emergent or less visible vulnerabilities. Robust monitoring, transparent eligibility criteria and periodic reassessments are essential to avoid exclusion errors.
- Community ownership vs. capacity constraints: Volunteer-run CBOs foster social cohesion and accountability; however, without recurrent funding or capacity-building, such organisations may struggle to sustain services or absorb larger funding flows. UNRWA’s technical inputs and small grants are catalytic but often insufficient for scaling or for institutionalisation.
- Coordination complexity: Partnerships with NGOs expand service modalities and resources but require clear division of labour, harmonised monitoring and safeguards to minimize duplication and ensure fiduciary accountability.

Implications for strategic culture and national security policy (relevance to India)
- Humanitarian assistance as a component of strategic posture: The UNRWA model illustrates how sustained humanitarian services — particularly those that protect civilians and enable social cohesion — contribute to broader regional stability. For states such as India, integrating humanitarian engagement into foreign policy (humanitarian diplomacy, development partnerships, support to host communities) can reinforce soft-power and strategic influence without direct military involvement.
- Gender-sensitive programming and resilience: Female-headed households and gender-differentiated vulnerabilities require tailored interventions (cash, childcare-enabled training, protection services). Indian national security planners and development agencies can draw lessons about the stabilising effect of women’s economic inclusion and the operational necessity of lowering participation barriers.
- Community-based delivery and risk management: Supporting local CBOs can be an effective modality for Indian external assistance, but donors must concomitantly invest in capacity-building, financial sustainability and monitoring systems to avoid short-termism and unintended dependency.
- Monitoring, targeting and legitimacy: The effectiveness and perceived legitimacy of assistance hinge on transparent targeting and robust monitoring. For India’s policy-makers, this argues for data-driven programming and coordinated multilateral engagement to ensure assistance reaches high-need groups without exacerbating local tensions.
- Limits of humanitarian measures without political solutions: Finally, UNRWA’s portfolio — food, cash, shelter repairs and social services — underscores the point that humanitarian and development measures can mitigate suffering and build resilience, but they cannot substitute for enduring political solutions where such solutions are the structural drivers of insecurity. India's strategic calculus should therefore combine humanitarian engagement with diplomatic efforts that address root causes where feasible.

Conclusion
- UNRWA’s interventions exemplify a layered approach to refugee assistance: immediate relief (food, cash, shelter), targeted social protection for high-need “hardship” households (including preferential education and training access), women-centred programming with enabling services (childcare), and community-based partnerships supported by technical and modest financial inputs. The model yields several lessons for state actors constructing strategic culture and national-security-oriented assistance policies: the importance of targeted yet inclusive design, gender-sensitive facilitation, sustainable support for local organisations, rigorous monitoring, and an appreciation of the limits of humanitarian action absent political resolution.

## UNRWA Health Program

Overview and mandate
- Since its establishment in 1950, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has been the principal health-care provider for registered Palestinian refugees across Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Its health programme is integral both to humanitarian protection and to longer‑term human development in protracted displacement settings.
- UNRWA’s health activities span a continuum from primary prevention and clinic‑based primary care to arrangements for secondary and tertiary treatment through referral, negotiated contracts and partial reimbursement mechanisms. The programme therefore operates at the nexus of public health, social protection and complex political constraints.

Service delivery architecture
- Primary health needs are delivered through a network of primary health facilities (PHFs) located in or adjacent to refugee camps and settlements. In 2014 UNRWA reported 139 such primary health facilities serving refugee populations.
- The Agency supplements primary care with access to secondary treatment through referrals to government, NGO and private hospitals; arrangements vary by host state and are mediated by negotiated contracts or financial reimbursement for hospitalisation.
- Complementary services include food assistance targeted to vulnerable groups (notably pregnant and nursing mothers), and a structured environmental health programme in camps addressing water, sanitation and vector control.

Key operational scale (2014 snapshot)
- Primary health facilities: 139 PHFs
- Health workforce: 3,107 health staff employed by UNRWA
- Refugees accessing services: 3,134,732
- Annual patient visits: 9,290,197
Notes: these 2014 figures illustrate scale but are dated; contemporary planning and analysis require updated population- and service-level data.

Clinical and programme content
- Core medical services delivered through PHFs include outpatient care, dental services and rehabilitation for people with physical disabilities.
- Maternal and child health is a programmatic priority. School health teams and camp medical officers screen new pupils; all clinics provide family‑planning counselling that emphasises birth spacing to improve maternal and child outcomes.
- UNRWA supervises food aid for pregnant and nursing mothers. In Gaza, six UNRWA clinics operate maternity units to provide intrapartum care.
- Hospitalisation assistance is delivered primarily through a mix of partial reimbursement and negotiated contracts with hospitals in host countries, supplemented by partner support when required.

Epidemiological transition and implications for care
- Over recent decades the refugee population served by UNRWA has exhibited a demographic and epidemiological transition: population ageing and the decline of communicable‑disease dominance have given way to rising burdens of non‑communicable diseases (NCDs).
- NCDs emphasised in UNRWA documentation include diabetes, hypertension and cancer. These conditions require lifelong care models — continuous medication supply, regular follow‑up, and referral pathways for complications — placing different demands on a system historically organised around episodic acute care.
- Despite the challenges of displacement, infant mortality among UNRWA‑served refugees has remained below the WHO developing‑world benchmark, reflecting sustained successes in maternal and child health interventions.

Health systems reform: Family Health Team (FHT) model
- In 2011 UNRWA introduced the Family Health Team (FHT) model, a reform rooted explicitly in World Health Organization primary health care (PHC) values.
- The FHT model is implemented within PHFs and seeks to provide comprehensive, person‑centred primary care at the family level. Core attributes include:
  - Comprehensiveness of services across prevention and curative care;
  - Continuity and long‑term provider–patient relationships;
  - Person‑centredness and attention to the life‑course (tailoring interventions by age and stage);
  - Integration of social determinants into care planning.
- The life‑cycle approach embedded in FHTs means services are designed to respond to needs from childhood (screening, school health) through reproductive-age care to older adult NCD management.

Addressing intersectional determinants of health
- FHTs intentionally address a range of intersectional influences on health: diet, physical activity, education, gender‑based violence, child protection concerns, poverty and community development. This recognizes that biomedical services alone are insufficient to control NCD risk or to protect vulnerable groups in camp environments.

Environmental health and WASH
- Environmental health services are a core preventive pillar in camps: routine drinking‑water quality control, sanitation services, vector and rodent control are conducted to prevent outbreaks and reduce epidemic risk in overcrowded settings.
- Environmental health remains central to preventing communicable outbreaks in contexts of high population density and constrained infrastructure.

Operational constraints and strategic priorities
- The UNRWA health programme operates under recurring constraints that shape service continuity and capacity:
  - Funding volatility: donor cycles and political decisions frequently affect programme stability and expansion.
  - Security and movement restrictions: blockades, checkpoints and conflict (notably in Gaza, parts of the West Bank and Syria) impede access to clinics and referrals to external hospitals.
  - Host‑country dependencies: availability of specialised hospital care depends on contracts and cooperation with host governments, NGOs and private providers.
  - Workforce development and retention: staff training, career pathways and retention are ongoing operational priorities.
  - Supply‑chain resilience: constant availability of essential medicines (including NCD drugs), vaccines and medical supplies is essential yet vulnerable.
  - Mental health and psychosocial support: protracted displacement generates significant behavioural‑health needs that are often under‑resourced and require integration into primary care.
  - Health information systems: robust routine monitoring is needed to track life‑cycle indicators, NCD trends and to evaluate reforms like the FHT.

Monitoring, evaluation and sustainability
- Metrics to monitor programme performance should include: NCD prevalence and incidence trends, maternal and infant mortality ratios, outpatient visit and hospitalization rates, medicine stock‑out frequencies, and patient satisfaction/access metrics.
- Reform efforts such as the FHT require rigorous evaluation covering access, quality of care, clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction and cost‑effectiveness to inform scale‑up and donor advocacy.
- Sustainability considerations point to investment in cost‑effective primary care, preventive services and community engagement as strategies to reduce the long‑term burden on secondary and tertiary services.

Strategic implications and lessons for national security and foreign policy
- Although UNRWA’s mandate and operating environment are specific to Palestinian refugees, several lessons have clear resonance for states’ strategic culture and national security planning, including for India:
  - Health as a stability instrument: resilient primary‑care networks contribute to social stability in protracted crises and can mitigate drivers of insecurity.
  - PHC and UHC alignment: adopting PHC‑centred reforms (like FHT) supports Universal Health Coverage goals and strengthens health diplomacy credentials in regional engagement.
  - NCDs in humanitarian settings: planning for protracted displacement must incorporate long‑term NCD management (continuous drugs, trained teams, referral systems) rather than treating crises as short‑term shocks.
  - Interagency partnerships: complex referral and specialised‑care needs require operational partnerships with host governments, NGOs and private providers; diplomatic and financial engagement can shape access.
  - Supply‑chain and workforce resilience: strategic investment in supply chains and human resources reduces vulnerability to shocks that can have wider security implications.
  - Data and evaluation: robust health information systems and impact evaluations are strategic tools — for resource mobilisation, operational improvement and demonstrating returns on humanitarian investment.
  - Political constraints: health programmes in contested environments are subject to political pressures that can affect access and funding; contingency and risk‑management plans are essential.
  - Mental health integration: psychosocial stability has both humanitarian and security relevance; integrating MHPSS into primary care contributes to social cohesion.
- For a country like India, which projects power regionally through development assistance and health diplomacy, the UNRWA experience underscores the need to design humanitarian health engagement that combines immediate relief with durable primary‑care capacity, NCD readiness, supply‑chain resilience, and evaluation frameworks to demonstrate strategic effect.

Conclusion
- UNRWA’s health programme exemplifies a long‑running, large‑scale humanitarian health system adapting from an acute, communicable‑disease orientation toward a life‑course, NCD‑inclusive primary care model embodied in the Family Health Team reform. Its successes and constraints illustrate the operational trade‑offs faced by any actor delivering health services in politically fraught, protracted displacement contexts. For policymakers and strategists concerned with health security, humanitarian action and regional stability, the programme offers concrete lessons on the centrality of primary health care, the imperatives of continuity of care for chronic conditions, and the political economy that conditions service delivery.

## UNRWA’s Microfinance Department (MD): Mandate, Performance and Strategic Implications

### 1. Introduction and institutional purpose
The Microfinance Department (MD) of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) was established in 1991 to alleviate poverty and promote economic development among Palestine refugees and adjacent poor or marginal communities. Its founding rationale is programmatic and strategic: to provide small-scale financial services that support income generation, employment creation and local enterprise development within a highly vulnerable population. As such, MD sits at the intersection of humanitarian relief, development programming and local economic stabilization — roles with clear social and political externalities in fragile contexts.

### 2. Organisational form and governance
MD operates as an autonomous financial unit within UNRWA. That autonomy confers operational flexibility (product design, portfolio management, local staffing and client outreach) while embedding the unit within a larger multilateral agency with humanitarian and political responsibilities. Autonomy therefore creates both advantages (speed, tailored operations) and obligations: MD requires transparent governance, clear accountability lines to UNRWA headquarters, and robust internal controls to reconcile commercial lending practices with the UN’s normative and fiduciary frameworks.

Key organisational facts
- Founding year: 1991.
- Status: autonomous financial unit of UNRWA.
- Geographic footprint: operations in three countries, giving MD the broadest regional microfinance coverage of any institution in the Middle East; it is the largest non-bank financial intermediary in the West Bank and Gaza.

### 3. Products, pricing and financial model
MD’s product set centers on capital investment loans and working-capital loans designed for micro- and small-enterprise needs. Critically, the department lends at commercial rates rather than as heavily subsidized microcredit. Its explicit financial objective is to be “as close to self-supporting as possible,” which shapes pricing, screening, and portfolio management practices.

Implications of the pricing and financial approach
- Commercial-rate lending reduces the need for recurrent donor subsidy but increases reliance on repayment performance for sustainability.
- The self-supporting target implies pressure to maintain portfolio quality and collection systems; it also creates potential tensions between commercial sustainability and mission-driven depth of outreach to the poorest clients.

### 4. Scale and reported outcomes (2023 snapshot)
MD reports a record of creating employment, generating income and empowering refugees through its financial services. Key cumulative figures as of 2023 are:
- Loans awarded: ~29,000
- Total loan value: US$531.41 million
- Youth outreach: 25% of clients
- Women outreach: 48% of clients

These figures indicate substantial scale and gender/youth reach relative to the refugee community it serves. High regional coverage and the concentration in the Palestinian territories make MD a significant non-bank financial intermediary in the West Bank and Gaza.

### 5. Operational strengths and comparative advantage
- Institutional capacity: Broad geographic coverage and the scale of lending suggest MD has developed distribution, credit assessment and portfolio-management capabilities that confer a comparative advantage in the Middle East microfinance market.
- Local knowledge and legitimacy: Embedded within UNRWA, MD benefits from institutional familiarity with refugee populations and a ready client base, enhancing outreach and social acceptability.
- Product focus: A mix of working and investment capital loans aligns with enterprise development and short-term liquidity needs.

### 6. Risks, trade-offs and contextual constraints
Operating simultaneously as a quasi-commercial microfinance provider and part of a humanitarian agency exposes MD to several interdependent risks.

Financial and operating risks
- Credit risk under shocks: political instability, conflict-related disruption or macroeconomic collapse can sharply increase defaults.
- Currency and regulatory risk: cross-border operations expose MD to exchange-rate volatility and differing regulatory regimes.
- Portfolio concentration: geographic concentration in conflict-affected territories amplifies systemic risk to portfolio quality.

Mission and governance trade-offs
- Mission drift: pressure to preserve financial self-sustainability may lead to prioritizing lower-risk, better-off clients and larger loan sizes at the expense of the poorest refugees.
- Accountability complexity: autonomy within UNRWA requires robust governance to avoid gaps between commercial lending practices and humanitarian mandates.

Other operational vulnerabilities
- Exposure to operational disruptions (security constraints, mobility restrictions).
- Dependency on repayment performance for cost recovery given commercial pricing.

### 7. Monitoring, performance metrics and evidence gaps
To manage the balance between sustainability and social impact, MD should monitor and report a set of core financial and social indicators:

Recommended monitoring metrics
- Portfolio-at-risk (PAR) and delinquency rates.
- Repayment rate and write-off ratios.
- Average loan size and portfolio distribution by loan size.
- Client retention and repeat-borrower rates.
- Outreach indicators disaggregated by gender, age (youth), refugee status and geography.
- Social impact indicators: changes in employment, household income, enterprise survival and measures of women’s economic empowerment.

Current data gaps (noted in reporting)
- Repayment performance and PAR indicators are not supplied in the summary data.
- Average loan size and distributional breakdown by country are missing.
- Operating-cost versus revenue balance (operational sustainability metrics) is not reported.
- Independent impact evaluation results (employment, income changes, empowerment) are not referenced.

Recommendation: regular, independent impact and financial audits to corroborate claims of employment creation and empowerment while making portfolio risks transparent to donors and UNRWA governance.

### 8. Strategic opportunities for program development
MD has several avenues to deepen impact and strengthen resilience:
- Digital financial services: leverage digital payments, mobile lending and management information systems to reduce transaction costs and extend reach, especially in constrained mobility environments.
- Strategic partnerships: collaborate with local banks, NGOs and development finance institutions to co-finance larger enterprises, refinance riskier portfolios and share technical assistance.
- Targeted products: scale tailored microloans, savings-linked products and skill-linked financing for women and youth to improve inclusion without sacrificing portfolio quality.
- Hedging and risk-sharing mechanisms: explore currency-hedging options and donor-backed portfolio guarantees to mitigate macro and political risks.

### 9. Security and policy relevance
In fragile and protracted refugee settings, microfinance interventions have implications beyond economic objectives. They intersect with social stability, state (or quasi-state) capacity and political dynamics. By supporting livelihoods and reducing economic desperation, a resilient microfinance programme can contribute to social cohesion and lessen drivers of instability — outcomes of clear interest to national security and strategic policy actors. Conversely, programme failure or perceived inequity in access can exacerbate grievances. For policymakers and security analysts, MD therefore exemplifies how development finance instruments can be integrated into broader strategies for stabilization, resilience and conflict sensitivity.

### 10. Conclusion and priorities going forward
UNRWA’s Microfinance Department represents a significant, mature micro-lending operation embedded within a humanitarian agency and focused on refugee communities. Its commercial-rate, self-supporting orientation confers financial discipline but necessitates careful governance to safeguard outreach to the most vulnerable. To consolidate impact and manage risk, priorities should include:
- Increased transparency on portfolio quality and operational sustainability metrics.
- Regular independent impact evaluations focused on employment, income and empowerment outcomes.
- Strategic investments in digital delivery, partnerships and targeted products for women and youth.
- Explicit coordination with UNRWA’s social protection and livelihoods programs to align financial services with broader development objectives.

These steps will help MD sustain its contributions to local economic opportunity while managing the trade-offs inherent in commercializing microfinance within fragile, politically sensitive environments.

(Note: figures cited are MD’s cumulative reported totals as of 2023: ~29,000 loans; US$531.41 million in total loan value; 25% youth outreach; 48% women outreach.)

### UNRWA and Emergency Operations: a concise account and its relevance for Indian strategic culture and national security

Opening note (metadata)
- The material below synthesizes the section outline provided and expands it into a short, scholarly treatment suitable for inclusion in a book on India’s strategic culture and national security policy. The original draft that prompted this rewrite lacked citations (tag dated January 2024). Wherever the text draws on established documentary practice, I indicate the primary documentary sources that should be cited in a final manuscript (UNRWA operational/annual reports; UN OCHA situation reports; UN General Assembly records; peer‑reviewed literature; reputable journalism). These are listed at the end as recommended sources for verification.

1. Mandate and operational footprint
- UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) was established in 1949 with a specific, time‑bound humanitarian and social service mandate for Palestine refugees. Over seven decades its role has become institutionalized in five fields of operation: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. That geographic footprint explains UNRWA’s recurrent involvement in emergency response: the Agency is the principal operational UN instrument specifically tasked with providing protection and basic services to a distinct refugee population across a politically volatile sub‑region.

2. Geographic emphasis and political context
- While UNRWA operates in multiple host states, emergency operations frequently concentrate in the occupied Palestinian territory (the West Bank and Gaza). The occupation, recurring armed confrontations, blockade dynamics (in Gaza) and cycles of internal displacement make these areas sites of recurrent humanitarian emergency. In neighbouring host states (Lebanon, Syria, Jordan) different political and security dynamics — including civil conflict and socioeconomic exclusion — similarly generate episodic large‑scale humanitarian needs among Palestine refugees.

3. Historical catalysts for emergency operations
- UNRWA’s emergency mobilizations are historically linked to major shocks in the region: the 1967 Arab–Israeli War (which produced new displacement and prolonged occupation), the first (late 1980s) and second (early 2000s) intifadas (urban violence, curfews, mass casualties and movement restrictions), and the 2014 Gaza War (large‑scale destruction, displacement and infrastructure loss). Each episode required the Agency to shift from steady service delivery to rapid life‑saving relief, protection interventions and support for population returns and reconstruction.

4. Range of emergency services and continuity programmes
- In acute phases UNRWA provides classic life‑saving inputs: temporary shelter, emergency water and sanitation, food, clothing and blankets. Beyond immediate relief, the Agency implements temporary job‑creation schemes (cash‑for‑work, short‑term livelihoods support) and assistance for rebuilding homes and community infrastructure. Critically, emergency operations also aim to preserve continuity in social services: maintaining health clinics, providing psychosocial care and keeping schools functioning (often through temporary learning spaces). Protection activities — legal assistance, child protection, monitoring of rights violations — form an integral part of the emergency response package.

5. Case study: Nahr el‑Bared reconstruction (Lebanon)
- Nahr el‑Bared refugee camp is widely cited in the literature as one of UNRWA’s most complex and largest reconstruction and return projects. Following intense fighting in 2007 between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the armed group Fatah al‑Islam, large parts of the camp were destroyed and tens of thousands displaced. UNRWA’s reconstruction timeline formally commenced in 2009 and combined shelter rehabilitation, infrastructure rebuilding, land/legal processes and socio‑economic reintegration measures. The Nahr el‑Bared case illustrates several characteristics of major post‑conflict reconstruction efforts: protracted timelines, intricate coordination with host government institutions, legal and ownership disputes, and the need to combine physical reconstruction with livelihoods and social services to enable sustainable return.

6. Coordination, partnerships and operational modalities
- UNRWA’s emergency responses are highly collaborative: the Agency coordinates with international non‑governmental organisations (INGOs), local civil society, host‑state authorities, and other UN agencies. Operational partnerships are necessary for scale, specialty inputs (e.g., specialised protection actors), and access negotiations. In protracted crises, UNRWA frequently acts as both service provider and convenor of humanitarian actors on the ground.

7. Constraints: funding, politics and operational scope
- Emergency effectiveness is resource‑dependent. UNRWA’s capacity to sustain operations is regularly affected by donor funding shortfalls and unpredictable political constraints — including politicisation of its mandate and contestation over refugee status and rights. These constraints can force prioritisation of services, delay reconstruction, or reduce the scope of protection and recovery programming. The Nahr el‑Bared reconstruction itself underscored how reconstruction programs require predictable multi‑year financing and sustained political engagement.

8. Relevance to Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- Several lessons from UNRWA’s emergency operations are pertinent to Indian strategic thinking:
  - Humanitarian diplomacy as soft power: India’s growing role as a regional actor includes humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. UNRWA’s long‑term presence shows how sustained aid presence can shape political relations, inform influence projection, and contribute to regional stability.
  - Managing protracted displacement: India’s strategic planners can draw lessons on institutionalising long‑term services (education, health, livelihoods) for displaced populations while preparing contingency surge capacity for acute crises.
  - Civil–military and civil–civil coordination: Effective emergency operations require civil‑military deconfliction, coordination with local authorities and NGOs — a modality India uses increasingly in its external relief (e.g., disaster relief, evacuation operations), and that has domestic resonance for internal displacement management.
  - Funding predictability and political choices: UNRWA’s experience demonstrates how financial volatility and politicisation impede humanitarian outcomes. For India, the choice to fund or partner in UN or bilateral emergency programs is both a policy instrument and a strategic signal.
  - Urban reconstruction and return: Large, complex urban reconstruction projects (like Nahr el‑Bared) combine technical, legal and socio‑political challenges. Indian planners engaged in overseas reconstruction or domestic post‑conflict recovery can benefit from the Agency’s operational lessons in sequencing, community engagement and integrating livelihoods with infrastructure.
  - Protection and continuity of services: Preservation of education and health services during conflict mitigates long‑term instability — a consideration relevant to India’s neighbourhood policy where social service continuity can reduce radicalisation and chronic insecurity.

9. Recommended documentary sources (to be cited)
- Primary operational and policy sources (to be consulted and cited):
  - UNRWA annual and operational reports (available on UNRWA.org).
  - UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) situation reports for Gaza, Lebanon and Syria.
  - UN General Assembly resolutions and reports referencing UNRWA’s mandate and budgetary arrangements.
  - Peer‑reviewed analyses and edited volumes on Nahr el‑Bared and UNRWA (scholarship in Middle East studies, refugee studies and humanitarian action).
  - Major investigative and analytical journalism (e.g., New York Times, BBC, Al‑Monitor) for contemporary accounts; and specialist NGOs reports for protection and reconstruction assessments.

Concluding remark
- UNRWA’s emergency operations combine immediate relief with long‑term continuity of social services and complex reconstruction work. For scholars of India’s strategic culture, the Agency provides a useful comparative case: it illustrates how humanitarian institutions operate under political constraint, the operational trade‑offs of protracted emergencies, and the strategic consequences that humanitarian assistance and reconstruction can have for regional stability and influence.

### UNRWA’s Infrastructure and Camp Improvement Programme (ICIP): Evolution, Practice, and Strategic Implications

Overview and scale
- As of 2023 UNRWA recorded 58 official Palestinian refugee camps across its five fields of operation; nine of these were undergoing active improvement projects. The Agency’s registry stood at approximately 6 million refugees, with 1.37 million individuals in Gaza registered as living in or using UNRWA camps. These figures underscore the magnitude and enduring nature of the refugee problem that the Infrastructure and Camp Improvement Programme (ICIP) seeks to address.

Ownership, administration and legal complexity
- It is important to emphasise a structural legal distinction: camps are neither owned nor administered by UNRWA. Host governments allocate land for camps and remain responsible for security and public order; UNRWA’s mandate is service delivery. Much of the land on which camps sit is privately owned, generating persistent legal and planning complexity. Private ownership complicates attempts at durable tenure solutions, constrains formalisation of infrastructure upgrades, and thus affects what kinds of interventions are feasible without political and legal negotiations with landowners and host authorities.

UNRWA’s operational role
- UNRWA’s role is primarily service-oriented. The Agency operates education, primary health, relief and social services, microfinance and emergency assistance, and many of these programmes extend beyond camp boundaries into surrounding urban and rural areas. Thus camps function as focal points for both concentrated humanitarian service delivery and broader, host-state-integrated social provisioning.

Spatial transformation and humanitarian conditions
- Camps have long ceased to be temporary tent cities in most locations; they have evolved into semi-permanent, extremely dense urban environments. UNRWA characterises many camps as “hyper-congested” and “overcrowded,” with infrastructure that is often critically substandard and at times life-threatening (poor sanitation, inadequate drainage, unsafe housing). High density magnifies public-health risks (rapid disease transmission, sanitation failures) and places disproportionate strain on basic services — a dynamic more acute in Gaza where the concentration of refugees intensifies humanitarian and infrastructural pressures.

ICIP: aims, methods and typical interventions
- Launched in 2007, ICIP was designed not as a set of temporary fixes but as a programme that applies comprehensive urban planning and community engagement to improve spatial and environmental conditions and to enhance long-term habitability. Core features include:
  - Use of integrated urban-planning methods to address physical infrastructure and spatial form;
  - Active community engagement to ensure acceptance, relevance and maintenance of works;
  - Adaptation of design and implementation to local host-country circumstances — ICIP is implemented differently in each field according to local needs, resources and political priorities.
- Typical ICIP activities span shelter rehabilitation or reconstruction, construction of new housing and community or service centres, routine maintenance works, and upgrades to public infrastructure such as sanitation, water drainage and road/path improvements. ICIP therefore aims to combine immediate humanitarian relief with investments in longer-term urban functionality and resilience.

Case study — Nahr al-Bared, Lebanon
- The Nahr al-Bared camp in northern Lebanon illustrates both the vulnerability of camps to violent conflict and the potential scale of reconstruction challenges. The camp was largely destroyed in 2007 during fighting between Fatah al-Islam militants and the Lebanese Armed Forces. UNRWA subsequently led the largest reconstruction project in its history. By April 2021 approximately 72% of the camp had been reconstructed; the project re-opened 386 shops and businesses and enabled roughly 3,550 families to return. Major donors included Saudi Arabia, Japan, the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates. The Nahr al-Bared experience highlights how reconstruction can restore livelihoods and facilitate return — but also how outcomes are contingent on stable donor commitments and security conditions.

Constraints, vulnerabilities and design considerations
- Dependence on donor funding makes ICIP initiatives vulnerable to geopolitical shifts and cyclical funding. Project continuity and scale can be abruptly constrained by changes in donor priorities. Security incidents or renewed conflict can rapidly reverse gains and impose heavy reconstruction costs.
- Private land ownership and the lack of formal tenure mechanisms limit the range of durable legal solutions that can accompany physical upgrades; without durable tenure, residents and donors may be reluctant to commit to substantial housing investments.
- Environmental and climatic vulnerabilities (poor drainage, heat, flood risk) require that upgrades integrate climate resilience measures — yet such integration often raises costs and technical complexity.
- Monitoring, evaluation and transparent reporting are essential for demonstrating ICIP effectiveness and for mobilising sustained funding; community engagement is equally essential for local ownership, maintenance and social legitimacy of interventions.

Strategic implications for external actors — relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For a rising middle-power with an expanding global footprint such as India, ICIP and similar multilateral programmes offer salient lessons and avenues of engagement:
  - Humanitarian engagement as a tool of strategic influence: Sustained contributions to urban refugee infrastructure can be a significant component of soft-power and diplomacy, particularly when aligned with host-state priorities and local needs.
  - Funding modalities: India’s assistance should account for the political volatility of donor environments by favouring multi-year, predictable funding, and by combining grants with technical cooperation to strengthen host-state and agency capacities.
  - Linking development and security thinking: Given that overcrowded, poorly serviced camps can become sites of radicalisation and instability, India’s national security calculus should integrate long-term humanitarian stabilization as part of broader regional security strategies — without reducing humanitarian actors to subordinate security proxies.
  - Legal and tenure issues: India can support normative and technical initiatives aimed at clarifying land-tenure pathways and municipal integration options, thereby increasing the durability and impact of infrastructure investments.
  - Climate resilience and urban planning: ICIP underscores the importance of integrating climate-sensitive design into humanitarian infrastructure — a priority that aligns with India’s growing emphasis on climate adaptation in its foreign assistance.
  - Multilateral partnership and capacity building: Engagement through UNRWA and similar agencies can be an effective channel for India to combine grant aid, construction expertise, and training (urban planning, sanitation engineering, M&E systems), reinforcing India’s image as a responsible partner in protracted crises.

Conclusion
- ICIP exemplifies a pragmatic, urban-planning-centred response to protracted displacement: it shifts focus from temporary relief to durable habitability while operating within severe political, legal and financial constraints. For policymakers concerned with national security and strategic culture, such programmes illustrate the interface between humanitarian action, legal-institutional contexts, donor geopolitics and long-term stability — an interface that warrants deliberate incorporation into national strategies for external assistance and regional engagement.

## UNRWA — Photo and film archives

This section examines the audiovisual archive of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA): its origins, composition, scale, custodial arrangements, and the legal, ethical and preservation questions that its holdings raise. While the archive is centred on the plight and relief of Palestinian refugees, its institutional trajectory and the operational choices that have shaped it offer broader lessons for how states and strategic actors treat documentary heritage in protracted conflicts — lessons that are pertinent to India’s strategic culture and national security policy when it comes to evidence, memory, humanitarian operations and information management.

### Origins, provenance and purposes

- The collection has been assembled primarily from photographs and film produced by UNRWA staff and by external contractors, including photographers seconded from other UN agencies. Inter-agency contributions (notably from the International Committee of the Red Cross and other UN photographers) are a defining feature of the holdings, reflecting operational cooperation across humanitarian organisations.
- An early tranche of material was provided by Red Cross staff and covers a period that predates the formal existence of UNRWA. This provenance mix means the archive documents not only agency activity but a longer historical record of the Palestinian refugee situation.
- UNRWA has collected audiovisual material with multiple, overlapping objectives: to create a historical record of refugees’ lives; to document operational activities and the delivery of relief; to support advocacy and public information campaigns; and to supply primary resources for scholarly research and education. The same assets therefore serve humanitarian, evidentiary and memory functions.

Illustrative item: among the archive items is a photograph showing men digging a mass grave after the Sabra and Shatila massacre (1982). Images of this kind are historically and politically sensitive, underscoring the archive’s intersection with contested narratives and human-rights scrutiny.

### Scale, formats and geographic scope (2008 baseline)

UNRWA’s holdings — as quantified in 2008 and subsequently augmented by digitisation efforts — are substantial and multi-format:
- Photographs: approximately 10,000 prints (c. 2008).
- Negatives: roughly 400,000 items (c. 2008).
- Colour slides: about 15,000.
- Motion picture film: 75 films.
- Videotapes: around 400 tapes.

Geographic coverage corresponds to UNRWA’s five fields of operation: Gaza, Jerusalem, the West Bank, Lebanon, and Syria. The breadth of coverage makes the collection a key visual record across multiple theatres of displacement and conflict.

### Custody, storage and redundancy

- Physical holdings are stored in UNRWA facilities in Gaza and in Amman. The dual-location arrangement provides some redundancy: material kept outside immediate conflict zones (Amman) mitigates the catastrophic risk that the Gaza holdings alone would face in episodes of intense violence.
- That said, physical holdings located in active or periodically volatile theatres (notably Gaza) remain vulnerable to conflict-related damage, looting, environmental degradation and infrastructure disruption. The archive therefore exemplifies the preservation risks faced by cultural and documentary assets in protracted conflict settings.

### Recognition and digitisation

- In 2009 UNESCO inscribed the UNRWA audiovisual collection on the Memory of the World International Register, recognising it as documentary heritage of global importance. Beyond symbolic value, this designation can strengthen arguments for preservation funding, technical support and international cooperation.
- UNRWA initiated a digitisation programme in 2012, aiming to make images available online. Digitisation yields multiple benefits: democratizing remote access for researchers and educators, reducing handling of fragile originals, and enabling digital long-term preservation strategies (including off-site backups and distributed copies).

### Preservation, metadata and cataloguing challenges

- The sheer volume of small-format items (notably ~400,000 negatives) imposes considerable demands on cataloguing and metadata creation. Without detailed indexing, the research utility of the collection is limited.
- Preservation of formats such as cellulose-based film, glass or acetate negatives, and magnetic videotapes requires climate-controlled storage, periodic conservation interventions, and format migration strategies to prevent information loss.
- Digitisation alone does not substitute for professional archival description: rigorous metadata (provenance, date, location, subject matter, rights status) is essential for discoverability, responsible reuse and legal traceability.
- Mixed provenance (UNRWA, Red Cross, other UN bodies and contractors) complicates rights management. Copyright, moral rights and donor-imposed restrictions must be clarified before release; this has implications for public access policies and for the use of material in advocacy or legal proceedings.

### Ethical, legal and evidentiary considerations

- Many images depict traumatic events and individuals in vulnerable circumstances. Ethical handling requires contextual framing, sensitivity to dignity, and policies on consent — particularly if images are republished or used in training or advocacy.
- From a legal and human-rights perspective, the archive may constitute probative material. Photographs and video can support historical research, truth-seeking inquiries and, where authenticated, legal proceedings. Proper chain-of-custody, metadata integrity and preservation protocols therefore have downstream legal significance.
- Access and dissemination policy decisions (what to make public, what to restrict and under what conditions) are consequential: open access advances scholarship and public awareness; restrictions may be needed to protect privacy, avoid retraumatisation, or comply with donor or copyright constraints.

### Inter-agency cooperation and institutional lessons

- The archive’s composition — with materials contributed by Red Cross personnel and other UN photographers — illustrates how documentary heritage in humanitarian contexts is often produced collaboratively across organisations. This requires interoperable standards for metadata, agreed preservation practices and shared access frameworks.
- UNESCO recognition and engagement open pathways for technical assistance and funding partnerships that national authorities and agencies might emulate.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Although UNRWA’s archive concerns a different region, several transferable lessons are relevant for Indian policymakers and institutions responsible for national security, disaster response and historical record-keeping:

- Documentary assets created during crises (conflict, displacement, natural disasters) have strategic value: they are instruments of memory, sources of operational accountability, and potential evidence in legal and human-rights processes. India’s strategic culture should recognise archival practice as part of resilience and information policy.
- Redundancy and geographic diversification of holdings reduce single-point-of-failure risk. State archives, defence, and humanitarian agencies should invest in off-site and international backup strategies, and in robust digitisation with secure, geographically dispersed storage.
- Metadata, provenance tracking and chain-of-custody procedures are essential if images and recordings are to serve evidentiary purposes. National security agencies should coordinate with cultural and archival institutions to establish standards for preservation and authentication.
- Ethical guidelines for the capture and use of imagery — concerning consent, representation of victims, and the potential for propaganda or misinformation — must be integrated into operational directives for security, police and humanitarian actors.
- International recognition (e.g., UNESCO registers) can open access to technical expertise and funding. India can leverage multilateral fora to strengthen preservation of documentary heritage linked to its own security-related historical records.
- Inter-agency cooperation — as seen between UNRWA, the Red Cross and other UN agencies — is crucial. India’s national framework should encourage protocols for sharing archival material among government departments, humanitarian actors and scholarly institutions while respecting legal and ethical constraints.

### Conclusion

UNRWA’s photo and film archive is a multifaceted resource: an operational record, a repository of collective memory, and a potential evidentiary corpus. Its history — accumulation from multiple actors, vulnerability in conflict zones, formal international recognition and a later digitisation push — encapsulates the practical challenges faced by archives that straddle humanitarian, legal and political domains. For India, recognising the strategic importance of such documentary collections and investing in preservation, metadata, ethical standards and inter-agency coordination will strengthen both historical accountability and national resilience in the face of crises.

### International Endorsements of UNRWA: Documentation, Themes and Strategic Implications

Overview  
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), mandated since 1949, has long occupied a contested but central place in international humanitarian architecture. Documentary evidence of external praise—from Nobel laureates and senior UN officials to state representatives—demonstrates persistent international backing for the agency’s humanitarian mission. These endorsements, recorded across time (notably in 2007 and again in 2024), coexist with recurrent criticisms about politicization and governance. The pattern of praise, caveats and emphasis on staff risk has concrete consequences for funding, operational space and the diplomatic calculations of states, including India.

Documented endorsements (selected)  
- Individuals and moral authorities: Nobel Peace laureate Mairéad Corrigan Maguire and former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan have publicly praised UNRWA’s role. Former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has similarly expressed support.  
- UN leadership: Statements by the president of the UN General Assembly have affirmed the agency’s importance.  
- State-level endorsements (sample): representations from the European Union, the United States, the Netherlands, Japan, Bangladesh, Cyprus, Jordan, Ghana and Norway have publicly praised UNRWA’s work.  
- Notable 2007 comments: Norway’s UN permanent representative described Norway as a “strong supporter” and characterized UNRWA as a “safety net” that provides immediate relief, basic services and dignity to Palestine refugees. On the same day Iceland commended UNRWA’s capacity to “deliver substantial results” despite life‑threatening conditions. Israel, while expressing continuing support for UNRWA’s humanitarian mission, explicitly noted concerns about the agency’s politicization.  
- Notable 2024 comment: On 17 January 2024, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller rejected calls to defund UNRWA, described its work in Gaza as “invaluable,” highlighted the high personal risk to UNRWA staff and stated that over 100 staff members had been killed while performing lifesaving duties. The statement framed UNRWA staff as making “heroic efforts” and reiterated US support and commendation.

Analytical themes in the endorsements
- Humanitarian indispensability: Endorsements repeatedly stress that UNRWA functions as a crucial safety net—delivering immediate relief, basic services and a measure of dignity—especially in protracted displacement contexts. Praise from prominent figures and states reinforces this narrative of indispensability.  
- Operational courage and risk: Recent statements, particularly the US comment in 2024, foreground the extreme personal danger faced by UNRWA staff (noting over 100 staff killed), using the language of heroism to legitimize continued support.  
- Long-term diplomatic backing: The mix of endorsements across time (2007 and 2024) shows sustained diplomatic support that transcends short political cycles and provides reputational capital for the agency.  
- Politicization and caveats: Even among supporters, there are explicit caveats—Israel’s 2007 remarks are salient—about politicization. These caveats reflect ongoing debates about neutrality, governance and the interplay between humanitarian assistance and political objectives.

Institutional consequences: funding, legitimacy and calls for reform
- Reliance on voluntary contributions: UNRWA depends heavily on voluntary donor funding. Public endorsements by high‑profile states and leaders serve to stabilise donor confidence and protect funding streams.  
- Legitimacy effects: Endorsements from Nobel laureates, UN leaders and donor states bolster UNRWA’s international legitimacy, which is crucial for operational access and partnerships in contested environments.  
- Oversight and conditionality pressures: The coexistence of praise and public concern about politicization fuels calls—by donor states, parliaments and watchdogs—for greater oversight, accountability mechanisms and sometimes conditional funding. Such pressures can lead to institutional reforms but also risk politicising humanitarian administration further.

Implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- Humanitarian diplomacy as soft power: India’s growing aspiration to be a responsible global actor is advanced by visible, principled engagement with humanitarian agencies. Affirming support for UNRWA’s humanitarian functions—while insisting on transparency—aligns with India’s image of principled non‑alignment and responsible stakeholder diplomacy.  
- Balancing principle and pragmatism: The pattern of endorsements shows that many states combine humanitarian backing with caveats about politicization. For India, this suggests a policy of conditional engagement: sustaining operational support where it advances human security and regional stability, while pressing for accountability and depoliticisation in line with India’s norms of sovereignty and institutional integrity.  
- Funding choices and reputational returns: Public political backing by major donors stabilises agency operations. If India elects to contribute, framing such contributions within humanitarian and operational benchmarks can maximise reputational gains without becoming entangled in politicized controversies.  
- Security and regional stability considerations: The emphasis on UNRWA as a safety net is relevant to India’s strategic calculus—protracted humanitarian crises in South West Asia have cross‑border instability implications (refugee flows, radicalisation, humanitarian corridors) that can affect Indian interests. Supporting credible humanitarian mechanisms is therefore consonant with national security objectives.  
- Operational lessons for Indian participation in UN humanitarian efforts: The high casualty rates among UNRWA staff underline the risks of operating in active conflict zones. India should leverage bilateral and multilateral engagement to improve staff protection, information-sharing, and compliance with international humanitarian law—both to protect personnel and to preserve the neutral space needed for aid delivery.

Conclusion  
The documented global endorsements of UNRWA—set alongside persistent critiques of politicization and the grave risks faced by agency staff—illustrate the dual nature of international humanitarian engagement: essential lifesaving work that simultaneously sits in a highly politicised arena. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy this mix argues for calibrated engagement: sustain and, where possible, increase principled humanitarian support; insist on transparency and safeguards to reduce politicization; and use India’s contributions to strengthen institutional resilience and operational security in complex emergencies.

### External Performance Assessment of UNRWA: Lessons from MOPAN (2011–2019)

Context and relevance
- External performance assessments of multilateral agencies are an important instrument of donor-state oversight and a signal of organisational accountability. For states recalibrating their international engagement—whether as long-standing donors or as newer providers of development and humanitarian assistance—the findings and trajectories revealed by such assessments affect funding decisions, partnership strategies, and reputational calculations. The case of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and its engagement with the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN) illustrates how periodic external review operates in practice and why it matters for strategic actors.

What MOPAN is and why it matters
- MOPAN (the Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network) is a consortium of donor governments that evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of multilateral organisations. Its assessments are designed to produce evidence-based judgements across a set of common dimensions so that donors can compare performance, harmonize oversight, and make informed funding and management decisions. Because MOPAN reports are used by donor governments to inform budgets, conditionalities and political engagement, their findings have direct material and political consequences for assessed agencies.

The assessment framework: four dimensions
- MOPAN’s analytic framework covers four interrelated dimensions of organisational performance:
  1. Strategic management — the organisation’s clarity of mission, strategic planning and alignment between strategy and results.
  2. Operational management — processes, systems and capacities for delivering programmes efficiently and effectively.
  3. Relationship management — engagement with stakeholders, partners and donors, including transparency and accountability.
  4. Knowledge management — learning systems, evidence use and the organisation’s ability to adapt based on lessons learned.

2011 assessment of UNRWA: summary of findings
- In 2011 UNRWA agreed to be assessed by MOPAN, signalling a willingness to submit to external scrutiny. The resulting assessment judged UNRWA to perform “adequately or well” on most key indicators across the four MOPAN dimensions. Strategic management emerged as a particular strength: the agency demonstrated coherent strategic direction and alignment between mandate and programming priorities. This relatively positive evaluation provided reassurances to donors about the agency’s core strategic orientation and systems.

UNRWA’s response and the politics of external review
- UNRWA responded constructively to the 2011 assessment, emphasizing that many of the challenges highlighted were common to multilateral organisations operating in complex political and operational environments. Agreeing to and engaging with MOPAN assessment processes is itself a strategic choice: it signals to stakeholders a commitment to accountability and creates opportunities to secure donor confidence. At the same time, agencies often stress the broader systemic constraints—funding volatility, political sensitivities and operating environments—that constrain reform uptake.

Trajectory to 2019: improvements and continued oversight
- MOPAN’s subsequent assessment of UNRWA (2019) showed tangible progress: the network commended improvements in programme efficiency and characterised the agency as “competent, resilient and resolute.” The interval between assessments (2011 → 2019) illustrates an ongoing monitoring relationship that can document institutional progress over time. MOPAN reports typically contain concrete recommendations for improvement; the value of the exercise depends not only on initial findings but on follow-up actions by the agency and monitoring by donors.

Implications for donor behaviour and strategic decision-making
- Because UNRWA depends heavily on voluntary donor funding, positive MOPAN findings can bolster its credibility and support resource mobilization. Conversely, critical findings can trigger increased conditionality, tighter oversight or funding reallocations. For states formulating their strategic culture and national security policy—particularly those expanding their role as development and humanitarian actors—MOPAN-type assessments offer analytical utility:
  - They provide comparative data to guide where to invest bilaterally or multilaterally.
  - They create leverage for aligning funding behind organisational reforms deemed necessary for value-for-money and accountability.
  - They inform risk assessments about partnerships with multilateral agencies operating in politically fraught contexts.

Concluding observations for strategy and policy
- The UNRWA–MOPAN interaction exemplifies how external performance regimes operate as instruments of international governance: they discipline organisations, shape donor perceptions, and, when taken seriously, can catalyse institutional improvement. For analysts of national strategy—India’s policymakers included—such mechanisms are important inputs when deciding how to engage with multilateral actors, how to balance strategic interests with normative commitments, and how to incorporate lessons from multilateral performance into national approaches to assistance and security-related diplomacy.

### UNRWA: Critiques, Responses, and Lessons for Strategic Engagement

Overview
- This section examines recurring criticisms of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), the agency’s institutional responses, and the broader governance implications for states that engage with multilateral organisations. The UNRWA case—marked by a cycle of external critique, reform initiatives, and episodic scandals—illuminates risks of institutional aging, accountability gaps and reputational exposure that are directly relevant to Indian policy-makers shaping India’s strategic engagement with international organisations.

Historical trajectory and key moments
- 2004: Scholars Emanuel Marx and Nitza Nachmias framed many critiques of UNRWA not as isolated failures but as symptoms of the agency’s advanced institutional age. They linked persistent problems to structural characteristics: organizational inflexibility, resistance to adapt to changing political conditions, and reluctance to hand responsibilities over to local authorities—in this case, the Palestinian Authority (PA).
- 2007: In response to long-standing criticisms, UNRWA launched a formal reform programme aimed at improving internal efficiency and programme delivery. The reform signalled institutional awareness of external concerns and a willingness—at least rhetorically—to modernise management practices.
- 2015–2019: Internal tensions reportedly intensified. According to a leaked ethics report published by Al Jazeera in 2019, problems alleged to have arisen since 2015 included consolidation of authority in senior management, erosion of internal checks, and the emergence of nepotism and other abuses among some high-ranking personnel.
- 2019: The leak itself became a political event, undermining the stability of formal assessments by drawing public and donor attention to alleged mismanagement and misconduct.

UNRWA’s formal responses and the accountability record
- UNRWA rebutted the leak’s implications by pointing to a set of positive formal assessments and oversight products, arguing these demonstrate institutional soundness:
  - MOPAN (Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network) external assessment: reported satisfactory or very satisfactory ratings for UNRWA’s management and impact. Given MOPAN’s role in assessing multilateral performance, this finding carries weight for donor confidence.
  - United Nations Board of Auditors: recognised the quality of UNRWA’s management and leadership in its reports, providing an additional formal audit endorsement.
  - UNRWA’s own oversight: the 2018 report prepared by its Department of Internal Oversight Services and Ethics Division was presented to the Advisory Commission (which includes host states and major donors) and cited by UNRWA as confirming positive internal assessments.
- UNRWA’s stated position has been that these reviews—external and internal—constitute public-record validation of its institutional robustness.

Tensions between leaks, public perception, and formal audits
- Independent leaks and media-published ethics reports create a distinct dynamic that can undermine the reassuring effect of formal audits:
  - Leaks bring matters into the public and political arena in ways that official assessments (even favourable ones) do not readily neutralise.
  - Donors and host governments may react to perceived reputational risk even when oversight reports are positive, prompting conditional funding, reputational constraints, or demands for governance reforms.
  - The coexistence of favourable audits and damaging leaks is therefore a crucial tension—in practice, both types of evidence shape stakeholder behaviour.

Why these dynamics matter to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Reputational risk and donor leverage: When India engages multilaterally—whether as donor, troop contributor, or participant in international governance—its willingness to invest political capital and resources will be shaped by perceptions of an organisation’s accountability and resilience to scandal.
- Exit and transfer strategies: The 2004 critique about UNRWA’s reluctance to transfer responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority highlights an operational lesson: long-term multilateral engagement should plan explicitly for capacity transfer to local actors and phased exit options to avoid indefinite dependency.
- Oversight and independent evaluation: The differing impacts of MOPAN-style assessments and leaked internal reports stress the need to support both rigorous external evaluation mechanisms and robust, transparent internal oversight that can withstand public scrutiny.
- Concentration of managerial power as a security risk: Consolidation of authority and poor whistleblower protections can create vulnerabilities—operationally (inefficiency, corruption) and strategically (sudden reputational fallout that affects national interests). Indian policy towards multilateral partners should prioritise governance safeguards.
- Donor coordination and political signalling: India’s position as an emerging provider of development assistance requires nimble coordination with other donors and host governments. The UNRWA timeline shows how political signals (e.g., publicised misconduct) can trigger cascading policy responses from multiple donor states.

Practical governance indicators for Indian decision-makers to monitor
- Presence and independence of external evaluators (e.g., MOPAN-type assessments).
- Frequency, independence and transparency of internal audits and ethics reports.
- Degree of managerial decentralisation and checks on power concentration.
- Evidence of concrete, time-bound plans for capacity transfer to local authorities.
- Robustness of whistleblower protections and mechanisms to investigate allegations.
- Donor coordination mechanisms and use of conditionality tied to reform benchmarks.

Policy implications and recommendations (concise)
- Condition multilateral assistance on clear governance benchmarks and time-bound reform plans while balancing political considerations that affect humanitarian outcomes.
- Support and invest in independent external performance assessments to inform strategic choices about engagement and funding.
- Insist on and help build capacity-transfer plans in programmes intended to be temporary or transitional.
- Prioritise transparency: require that oversight findings—internal and external—are shared with donors and oversight bodies to reduce asymmetries that produce damaging leaks.
- Incorporate reputational risk assessments into strategic planning for multilateral engagement; design contingency responses to manage fallout from leaks or allegations.

Conclusion
- The UNRWA case encapsulates the governance dilemmas that attend long-standing multilateral agencies: structural rigidity, episodic reform, and the destabilising potential of leaks. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the lesson is clear—effective multilateral engagement demands not only diplomatic acumen and resources, but systematic attention to governance, independent oversight and planned transitions to local authority. These measures protect both humanitarian outcomes and national strategic interests.

## Case study: UNRWA — institutional design, political consequence, and the refugee question

This section examines the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) as an analytic case of how international-organizational design and policy choices can have persistent political effects. Though the specific agency operates in the unique context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, its story illustrates broader lessons about mandate design, comparative institutional practice, and the interaction between humanitarian relief and long-running political disputes — issues salient to any state (including India) that engages with international organizations and refugee policy.

### Background and mandate
- UNRWA was established in 1949 to provide relief and social services to Palestinians displaced by the 1948 Arab–Israeli war. Its core task, as originally framed, is relief and humanitarian assistance to registered Palestinian refugees.
- The agency’s operational definition is distinctive: UNRWA registers as refugees the persons who were displaced in 1948 and "their descendants" — effectively creating a multi‑generational refugee population that is unique among UN agencies.
- UNRWA was intentionally designed not to determine or prescribe the final political solution to the refugee question. Its mandate is limited to relief, social services (education, health, relief), and short‑to‑medium term assistance pending a political resolution.

### UNRWA versus UNHCR: institutional contrast
- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), created in 1950, operates on a different legal and operational logic. UNHCR’s mandate focuses on helping refugees rebuild autonomous lives, with durable solutions emphasized: local integration, resettlement in third countries, or voluntary repatriation.
- By contrast, UNRWA’s inclusion of descendants has produced a steadily growing registered refugee population without implying new displacement events. This demographic expansion stems from the agency’s definition rather than successive waves of flight.
- The two agencies therefore demonstrate how foundational legal definitions and institutional approaches shape long‑term outcomes: UNHCR’s programmatic incentives favor rapid movement toward durable solutions; UNRWA’s framework preserves a distinct refugee identity across generations.

### Core criticisms and key voices
- Some critics argue that UNRWA’s institutional choices have had political consequences that perpetuate the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. A notable op‑ed in The Wall Street Journal Europe (April 2011) by Asaf Romirowsky and Alexander H. Joffe contended that UNRWA has failed to foster a genuinely civil Palestinian society and argued that the agency should be disbanded so Palestinians could build their own institutions.
- James G. Lindsay, who served as UNRWA general counsel, published a critical report in 2009 assessing agency practices. Lindsay concluded that UNRWA had not replicated a UNHCR‑style drive toward durable resettlement and suggested that this reflected agency political choices.
- Lindsay and some other analysts contend that these choices — particularly the practice of recognizing descendants as refugees — appear to align with political currents that insist on a collective "right of return" to what is now Israel, thereby entrenching the refugee claim as an intergenerational, political issue.
- UNRWA and its defenders counter that the agency’s mandate is humanitarian, not political, and that many operational constraints (host‑country policies, donor positions, and the absence of a negotiated settlement) limit what the agency can or should do.

### Operational and political consequences
- The design choice to include descendants has created a long‑standing and numerically large refugee register that is politically salient: it frames the refugee question as a continuing, unresolved claim in negotiations about a "just and durable political solution."
- Funding for UNRWA is voluntary and politically sensitive. Donor decisions directly affect service delivery and staffing; shifts in donor policy can have immediate operational consequences and also signal political stances toward the broader conflict.
- Allegations against UNRWA have included concerns about neutrality, political influence within staffing and curricula, and potential partiality in operations. UNRWA disputes claims of systemic bias and emphasizes its humanitarian responsibilities and oversight mechanisms.
- The divergence in institutional approaches between UNRWA and UNHCR shows clearly that aid agencies’ legal mandates and programmatic incentives can shape political identity, stakes in negotiation, and the possibilities for durable solutions.

### Reform, disbandment, and practical obstacles
- Proposals to disband or fundamentally reform UNRWA have been floated by critics but would require complex political bargaining among Palestinians, Israel, host states (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria), donors, and the agency itself.
- Practical obstacles to UNHCR‑style resettlement include host‑country unwillingness to naturalize large refugee populations, regional political constraints, the preferences of refugees themselves, and the central unresolved status of the "right of return" in Israeli–Palestinian negotiations.
- Any meaningful change in outcomes depends less on purely technical fixes within a humanitarian agency and more on political agreements that address the underlying causes and end‑states of displacement.

### Broader implications for policy and strategic culture
- For states and strategists, the UNRWA case underscores how institutional design choices — even when ostensibly humanitarian — can have enduring political effects. Mandates, definitions, and registration rules matter.
- A strategic culture that engages with international organizations needs to attend to long‑term incentives created by institutional arrangements. Where relief agencies become de facto permanent providers, they can alter local political economies, identities, and bargaining positions.
- For India (and states with substantial diaspora, refugee, or minority policy concerns), the lesson is twofold: (1) engage carefully with multilateral institutions’ legal definitions and programmatic incentives, and (2) recognize that humanitarian responses intermesh with political bargaining — reform therefore requires political solutions as well as administrative adjustments.

### Conclusion
UNRWA’s history and controversies are a pointed example of the political consequences of organizational design. The agency’s unique mandate — and the criticisms it has attracted — illuminate how relief institutions can become entangled in unresolved political conflicts. Understanding these dynamics is essential for policymakers who must weigh humanitarian imperatives against their long‑term political effects and for scholars of international organizations who seek to connect institutional form to political outcomes.

### Protection of Palestinian Refugees: Asem Khalil’s Diagnosis and Policy Prescriptions

This section summarizes and assesses the argument advanced by Asem Khalil (Associate Professor of Law, Birzeit University; Dean, Faculty of Law and Public Administration) concerning the protection of Palestinian refugees in host countries and the institutional role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Khalil’s work combines field documentation from Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria with legal and policy analysis to reach a practical, rights‑based set of conclusions about the necessary shape of international protection for Palestinians.

Author, method and empirical focus
- Asem Khalil is a legal scholar working on human rights and Palestinian law. His study is empirical and comparative, systematically documenting the legal, economic and social conditions of Palestinians in four principal host states (Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria).
- The method is descriptive-analytic: field documentation of laws and practices is combined with legal argumentation about states’ obligations and the operational capacity of UN agencies.

Core claim and analytical framing
- Khalil’s central claim is twofold: UNRWA is necessary given the particularities of Palestinian refugeehood, but it is presently unable—because of structural and financial constraints—to deliver adequate protection for Palestinian refugees.
- He rejects two polar responses that sometimes appear in policy debates: (a) that host Arab states may legitimately treat Palestinians as “unique” in a way that excuses discriminatory national laws and practices; and (b) that UNRWA should be replaced outright by UNHCR. Instead, he argues for strengthening protection capacity through additive institutional measures.

UNRWA’s role, limits and vulnerability
- UNRWA occupies a unique institutional niche: its mandate expressly covers Palestinian refugees and their descendants in the region, and it is the primary provider of public goods to many Palestinian communities—education, primary health care, employment, social services and certain forms of economic support.
- The Agency’s funding model is highly donor‑dependent and voluntary. This makes UNRWA vulnerable to global financial shocks and political decisions by major contributors.
- Cuts to UNRWA funding would have immediate and concrete effects: loss of jobs (UNRWA is a major employer of Palestinian refugees), reduced access to health and education, and an increased resort to precarious coping strategies among refugees who are constrained by host‑state legal regimes.

Host‑state legal regimes, “Palestinian uniqueness,” and rights deficits
- Host states apply different legal regimes to Palestinians. Jordan has naturalized significant numbers of Palestinians but others remain in precarious status; Lebanon maintains restrictive access to employment, property and civil rights; Egypt and Syria each apply particular legal limitations. These variations directly affect vulnerability and protection needs.
- Khalil warns that the rhetoric of Palestinian “uniqueness” should not become a pretext for maintaining discriminatory laws and policies that deny basic civil, economic and social rights. Host states cannot defer their human‑rights obligations by invoking exceptionalism.

Risks stemming from reduced resources
- The global financial crisis and shifts in donor priorities constitute real and present risks. Reduced international financing could force UNRWA to curtail services that many refugees cannot otherwise access because of legal and economic exclusion in host countries.
- Such reductions would disproportionately harm the most vulnerable Palestinians—women, children, the elderly and the unemployed—and could increase instability in host communities.

Institutional policy options: not either/or, but additive
- Khalil rejects a binary choice between UNRWA and UNHCR. He argues that the appropriate response is either:
  - to strengthen UNRWA’s protection role—through secured, predictable funding, expanded protection functions and improved partnerships with rights actors; or
  - to extend UNHCR’s protective mandate to include Palestinian refugees as an additional layer of protection, operating alongside UNRWA and national actors.
- Crucially, any change should be additive rather than substitutive: introducing UNHCR protection should not be aimed at replacing UNRWA but at complementing it and filling protection gaps.

Political sensitivities and implementation challenges
- Any re‑architecture of protection is politically fraught. Changes touch upon sensitive topics: the right of return, the historical and political status of Palestinian refugees, host‑state sovereignty and regional diplomacy.
- Implementation would require complex negotiation among host states, donors, UN agencies, and refugee representatives. Legal/policy reforms in host countries may be necessary to allow expanded protection functions to operate effectively.

Practical policy responses (operational priorities)
Khalil’s analysis points to a set of practical policy responses that are feasible and rights‑oriented:
- Diversify and secure funding: move toward multi‑year, predictable financing for UNRWA to reduce vulnerability to short‑term donor shifts.
- Clarify and expand protection mandates: define the scope of UNRWA’s protection responsibilities, and, where appropriate, formalize complementary roles for UNHCR—explicitly additive rather than replacement.
- Strengthen partnerships: enhance cooperation between UN agencies, host governments, local NGOs and civil society to broaden protection coverage and service delivery.
- Pursue legal and policy reform in host states: press for the gradual removal of discriminatory laws and the expansion of labor, property and civil rights for Palestinians to reduce structural vulnerability.
- Prepare contingency planning: design mechanisms to prevent abrupt service collapses—e.g., bridging funds, emergency donor pledges, and local capacity building.

Broader implications for strategic and policy communities
- For states and policymakers—whether in the Middle East, the EU, or states like India that engage with the UN system—the Khalil diagnosis illustrates a general principle about refugee protection architecture: when an agency’s mandate is unique and historically embedded, reform must preserve rights protection while accounting for political sensitivities.
- From a strategic‑policy standpoint, reforms that leave protection gaps risk humanitarian harm and regional instability; therefore, donor states and regional powers have an interest in predictable support and pragmatic, politically informed institutional design.
- For India’s strategic community specifically, the case demonstrates how humanitarian institutions interact with state sovereignty, regional diplomacy, and long‑term political questions. India’s contributions to multilateral institutions, its voting and financing stances, and its bilateral relationships in the region all shape the feasibility of either strengthening UNRWA or expanding UNHCR’s role.

Conclusion
Asem Khalil’s argument is a careful, pragmatic plea: Palestinian refugees require reliable, rights‑based protection; UNRWA remains indispensable but needs structural strengthening; host states must not hide behind “uniqueness” to maintain discriminatory regimes; and any institutional reform should be additive—expanding protection capacity without erasing UNRWA’s distinct role. Meeting these aims will require secured funding, political negotiation, legal reform in host states, and coordinated international engagement to avoid both service collapse and deterioration in refugee protection.

### UNRWA and Textbook Content: History, Assessments, Findings, and Policy Implications

This section examines debates over school textbooks used by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and by UNRWA — the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East — summarizing major scholarly and policy assessments, UNRWA’s institutional responses, and the broader implications for international education policy in politicized, protracted-conflict settings. The material is relevant to analysts of international organizations and to policymakers (including donor states) who weigh the reputational and operational risks of supporting education in contested environments.

1. Background: administration of Palestinian education after Oslo
- The Oslo Accords (early–mid 1990s) fundamentally altered governance in the West Bank and Gaza by transferring many civilian competences from Israeli authorities to the Palestinian Authority. One practical consequence was the dismantling of Israeli textbook censorship offices and the PA’s progressively greater responsibility for curriculum and textbook production.
- UNRWA, as the primary formal education provider for registered Palestine refugees, typically implements host-country or PA curricula in its schools. UNRWA-run schools in neighbouring host states (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria) were not directly impacted by the post-Oslo PA curriculum changes.
- In the immediate post-Oslo era PA students used Jordanian and Egyptian textbooks; from around 2000 onward the PA began issuing its own textbooks. At the same time, UNRWA developed supplementary materials intended to promote tolerance, non‑violence and human‑rights values in its classrooms — particularly after UNESCO monitoring of curricula wound down.

2. Major reviews and how they were conducted (methodological caveats)
- Multiple international and bi‑national bodies have reviewed Palestinian textbooks at different times (notably Nathan Brown; the Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information, IPCRI; the Council of Religious Institutions in the Holy Land; the German Georg Eckert Institute). Findings vary because of differences in sampling (grades, years, editions), analytic frameworks (qualitative vs quantitative coding), and whether reviewers compared “old” and “new” editions.
- An important conceptual distinction appears across studies: bias versus incitement. “Bias” denotes one‑sided narratives, omissions, or contesting of the other’s claims; “incitement” denotes explicit calls to hatred or violence. Many reviewers emphasize this distinction in their judgments and recommended responses.

3. Key assessments and their principal conclusions
- Nathan Brown (2005): Brown compared pre‑ and post‑1994 material and concluded that PA textbooks had undergone important changes after the PA assumed control. He criticized earlier CMIP work for mixing outdated editions but judged the newer PA books to show marked improvement — removal of explicit antisemitic tropes and the introduction of Palestinian national narratives that mention Israel but often without extended engagement. Brown viewed the net change as significant progress from the vantage points of Jewish, Israeli and humanitarian observers.
- IPCRI (2003 and 2004 reports to the U.S. State Department): IPCRI’s 2003 executive summary characterized the PA curriculum orientation as generally peaceful, with no overt incitement against Israel or Jews and a number of passages stressing tolerance. The 2004 follow-up reiterated that textbooks did not generally promote hatred, though they legitimized resistance to occupation in places. IPCRI flagged recurrent deficiencies: maps and place‑naming practices that “appropriate” sites inside Israel by labeling them Palestinian; near‑absence of references to Jewish historical ties to the land; occasional offensive language in accounts of historical events.
- U.S. State Department synthesis (2009): Following another PA revision in 2006, academic reviewers again judged that textbooks did not openly incite violence against Jews but displayed imbalances, biases and factual inaccuracies similar to the IPCRI findings.
- Council of Religious Institutions in the Holy Land (2013): Using an international panel to compare Israeli and Palestinian textbooks, the study found most books to be factually accurate but noted important problems in maps and portrayal of “the other.” Quantitatively, neutral depictions of the other were uncommon (4% Israeli textbooks vs 15% Palestinian); negative or very negative depictions were frequent (49% Israeli overall — driven up to 73% in Haredi religious texts — versus 84% Palestinian). Highly negative depictions appeared in 26% of Israeli texts and 50% of Palestinian texts. The study also commended both sides for the relative scarcity of overtly dehumanizing content.
- Georg Eckert Institute (recent comprehensive review): Examining a broad sample of PA textbooks (156 titles), the institute identified only two instances involving antisemitic motifs; one had already been removed by the publisher and the other was subsequently altered. The institute’s findings contributed to the characterization of the overall picture as “nuanced” rather than uniformly inflammatory.
- Internal and UNRWA‑adjacent critiques: Former UNRWA officials and internal reports (e.g., James G. Lindsay’s 2009 critiques and admissions by UNRWA field leaders such as John Ging) have acknowledged imperfections in PA textbooks used in UNRWA schools.

4. UNRWA’s policy responses and institutional measures
- From the 2000s onward UNRWA undertook a sustained strategy of curricular supplementation. The agency created materials and programmes focused on Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance (HRCRT). In 2012 UNRWA adopted an agency‑wide HRCRT policy intended to:
  - integrate human‑rights education across its schooling system;
  - promote respect for rights, non‑violent conflict resolution and pluralistic values;
  - support students’ pride in Palestinian identity while encouraging constructive engagement with wider society.
- Where problematic content was discovered specifically within materials produced or disseminated by UNRWA, the agency has sometimes removed content or blocked public access to certain online resources. In 2021, following external allegations and donor investigations (notably by Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom), UNRWA blocked access to materials and acknowledged lapses after receiving specific substantiated claims.

5. 2021–2024 controversies and accountability actions
- In 2021 a set of high‑profile allegations claimed that UNRWA had produced or disseminated materials that incited violence and glorified terror. Donor governments launched inquiries; the UK reported that some UNRWA material did incite violence. In response, UNRWA’s Commissioner‑General Philippe Lazzarini publicly acknowledged that some materials appearing in UNRWA contexts contained incitement, glorification of terror and antisemitic language, and said corrective steps were being implemented.
- By 2024 syntheses of international assessments described the evidence base as complex and nuanced: across multiple, methodologically distinct reviews the dominant pattern was one of bias and antagonistic representation in places, while overt antisemitic content was relatively rare and often identified and corrected when detected. The Georg Eckert Institute’s finding that only two instances of antisemitic motifs appeared across a large sample — both remediated — exemplifies this conclusion.

6. Patterns of problematic content and their symbolic stakes
- Recurrent concerns across studies:
  - Map practices and “appropriation”: Textbooks sometimes label villages and sites inside internationally recognized Israeli 1948 boundaries as Palestinian place‑names. Such cartographic choices have symbolic potency and are read as denial of the other side’s territorial claims.
  - Historical omissions: Many PA textbooks underrepresent or omit Jewish historical ties to the land, or fail to acknowledge Jewish narratives of nationhood; reviewers describe this as a form of denial or incomplete history even when explicit invective is absent.
  - Isolated offensive language and motifs: Some editions contained problematic wording or isolated motifs that reviewers characterized as antisemitic or as glorifying militant resistance. These examples tend to be episodic rather than systemic according to several reviewers.
- Pedagogical effect: Textbooks primarily form identity narratives and intergroup perceptions in early schooling; therefore omissions, framing choices, and representations in maps and history textbooks carry disproportionate influence on how young learners conceive of belonging, rights, and the legitimacy of others.

7. Implications for donors, UNRWA and peacebuilding
- Education content affects long‑term intercommunal attitudes and prospects for reconciliation. Persistent bias, exclusion of the other’s historical claims, or symbolic appropriations in schoolbooks can undermine the social foundations for mutual recognition and compromise.
- Donor scrutiny has direct operational consequences. External findings have prompted investigations, public controversy, reputational risk for UNRWA, and intermittent withholding of funds — illustrating how curricula in contested settings become a political as well as pedagogical issue.
- Remediation is possible but incomplete. UNRWA’s HRCRT supplements, removal or revision of specific passages, and improved oversight have reduced some risks, but ongoing monitoring is required because editions change and political pressures on curriculum persist.

8. Policy lessons and recommendations (operational and normative)
- Maintain transparent, periodic third‑party reviews of host‑country/PA textbooks used in UNRWA schools. Reviews should be methodologically consistent over time (sampling multiple grades and editions) so change can be reliably tracked.
- Continue and expand HRCRT‑style supplemental curricula and systematic teacher training so that teachers can contextualize problematic passages and teach critical thinking about contested narratives.
- Institute prompt remediation protocols: when clearly inciting or antisemitic/anti‑other passages are found, prioritize immediate removal or alteration and document actions taken.
- Publish a public, timestamped log of identified problems and subsequent curricular changes to enhance accountability to donors, host communities and civil society.
- Encourage comparative, methodologically rigorous studies across time and grades to evaluate progress and inform policy interventions.

9. Stakeholders
- Primary actors include the Palestinian Authority (curriculum developer), UNRWA (implementer for refugee education), and retrospective actors such as Israel (which previously exercised textbook censorship).
- External reviewers and monitors (IPCRI, Georg Eckert Institute, Council of Religious Institutions, independent scholars) provide the analytical evidence base that donors and UNRWA use for decisions.
- Donor governments (U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, EU institutions) are influential because their funding and political pressure shape UNRWA’s incentive environment.
- Ultimately, affected communities — students, teachers and parents — are the immediate stakeholders whose identities and socialization trajectories are influenced by curricular choices.

10. Concluding assessment and relevance for comparative strategic policy
- The evidence summarized here supports a measured conclusion: post‑Oslo PA textbooks and UNRWA‑administered education show substantial improvements relative to earlier eras, yet important and recurring biases remain — particularly in maps and omission of the other’s historical narratives. Overt incitement and antisemitic content appear to be limited in frequency and often corrected when identified, but their episodic presence fuels political disputes and donor reactions.
- For countries and organizations engaged in education in divided societies (including donor states such as India when engaging international institutions), key takeaways are procedural: invest in transparent monitoring, support pedagogical supplements that build critical and rights‑based competencies, require rapid remediation protocols, and frame education assistance as long‑term social investment rather than merely short‑term service delivery.
- In short, curricular content in protracted conflicts is both symbolically potent and policy‑relevant: managing it effectively requires combining technically rigorous review, proactive pedagogical support, and clear accountability mechanisms to minimize the risks to peacebuilding and institutional credibility.

## UNRWA — Relationship with Hamas

Summary
- The relationship between the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and Hamas has been a recurring source of controversy from 2004 through 2025. Allegations range from political sympathy among staff to active membership or operational collaboration with armed groups, and extend to claims that UNRWA premises were misused by militants. UNRWA has repeatedly emphasised its mandate of impartial humanitarian service and political neutrality, while critics — including national governments, media outlets, former UN officials and victims — have pressed for verification, accountability and reform. The contested narrative is shaped by varied actors with different interests and by operational constraints in conflict zones.

1. Origins of the controversy: 2004–2005
- October 2004: Peter Hansen, then UNRWA Commissioner‑General, told CBC Television that there were probably Hamas members or sympathizers among UNRWA staff in Gaza. His initial remark triggered wide attention because it came from the agency’s senior official.
- Hansen’s clarified position: he said that membership alone was not a crime under UNRWA rules and that UNRWA did not “politically vet” staff; instead the agency expected staff to be politically neutral in conduct. He later clarified that he had meant “Hamas sympathizers” rather than active militants.
- Statistical framing: Hansen explained to donors that, given roughly 8,200 Gaza employees and public support for Hamas around 30% at the time, the presence of sympathizers was statistically likely. He pointed to existing UNRWA rules and regulations designed to ensure staff impartiality.
- Leadership fallout: Hansen’s reappointment was blocked by the United States and he was obliged to retire on 31 March 2005 — an early indication of donor influence on UNRWA leadership and the politicisation of personnel issues.

2. Recurrent allegations and contested union politics (2009–2012)
- Internal critique: In 2009 James G. Lindsay (former UNRWA general counsel, then with WINEP) argued that UNRWA had not done enough to detect or prevent Hamas members from joining the agency. This critique emphasised procedural and oversight weaknesses.
- Teachers’ union disputes (2009): The Jerusalem Post reported that Hamas won a UN schools teachers’ union election in Gaza in 2009; UNRWA strongly denied this. UNRWA emphasised that staff elections are individual ballots (not party lists) and that unions deal with labour issues, not formal political mandates.
- Operational guidance: John Ging, head of UNRWA operations in Gaza, stated (29 March 2009) that employees must not be under political party influence in the performance of their duties — an explicit restatement of the agency’s neutrality requirement.
- 2012 media claims: Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that a staff union election in Gaza yielded 25 of 27 seats to Islamists or Hamas sympathizers, with turnout reported at about 80% of ~9,500 employees. UNRWA countered these kinds of reports by reiterating the independence of individual votes and the non‑political remit of unions; independent verification of internal union politics has often been limited.

3. Allegations of personnel involvement in violence (2023–2024)
- October 2023 allegations: The Israeli government supplied intelligence alleging that 18 UNRWA workers participated in the October 7, 2023 attacks. These claims were serious because they tied humanitarian workers directly to a large‑scale act of violence; UNRWA denied or questioned some of the allegations and requested evidence and independent investigation.
- 2024 confirmation: On 30 September 2024 UNRWA confirmed that Fatah Sharif — previously on its payroll as a school principal and head of the teachers’ union in Lebanon — had later been killed as a top Hamas commander in Lebanon. UNRWA stated it had suspended Sharif in March after an allegation that he belonged to Hamas’s political wing and had opened an investigation; the agency said it did not know he was a commander. Hamas publicly praised Sharif posthumously for his “educational and jihadist work.” This case illustrates both the limits of internal detection and the difficulty of assessing individual biographies over time.
- Additional state allegations: Earlier media reports and Israeli government claims have alleged that UNRWA employed at least 24 members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad across its schools — including principals and deputy principals, some of whom were purportedly active fighters. These accounts have been contested and remain a matter of investigation and dispute.

4. Claims about misuse of premises and recent hostage testimony (2025)
- Hostage testimony (Feb 2025): Former hostage Emily Damari alleged that part of her 15‑month captivity included time in a UNRWA facility. The claim renewed public concern about the use of humanitarian facilities by armed actors.
- UNRWA’s response: The agency noted that in many cases during intense hostilities it has lacked access to its own facilities and that many sites had been converted into shelters. UNRWA called for an independent investigation into any misuse of its premises and reiterated that it had no institutional knowledge that would have allowed it to foresee or permit enforced detentions.

5. Sources, bias and evidentiary problems
- Heterogeneous sources: The allegations and rebuttals derive from a range of actors — UN officials, host and donor governments (notably Israel and the United States), local and international media (e.g., The Guardian, Yedioth Ahronoth, Jerusalem Post), former staff/legal affiliates and victims. Each source brings different perspectives, incentives and potential biases.
- Intelligence versus open evidence: Many government claims have been based on classified intelligence that is not publicly corroborated; conversely, UNRWA’s ability to investigate is often constrained by lack of access to sites and sensitive security conditions. This makes independent verification difficult and politicises evidentiary standards.
- Statistical and methodological caveats: Cited numbers (staff counts, turnout rates, percentages of public support) vary across reports and years; qualitative claims about “sympathizers” are different in kind from allegations of active membership or operational collaboration. Conflating these categories obscures policy responses.

6. Implications and risks
- Reputational risk: Persistent allegations damage UNRWA’s credibility with donors, host states and beneficiaries, potentially threatening funding and the agency’s operational mandate.
- Security risk: If militants threaten, coerce, infiltrate or otherwise compromise UN premises and personnel, the safety of staff and civilians is jeopardised and humanitarian neutrality is undermined.
- Policy tensions: UNRWA faces a classic humanitarian dilemma — non‑discriminatory hiring practices intended to serve all refugees can coexist uneasily with the need to safeguard neutrality and security. Strengthening vetting and oversight must be balanced against local labour law, non‑discrimination obligations and the practicalities of large‑scale employment in refugee settings.
- Donor leverage and politicisation: External influence (for example, the U.S. role in leadership appointments) can prompt governance changes but also politicise the agency’s independence, shaping appointments, priorities and public narratives.
- Verification challenges: Conflict environments and limited access complicate evidence‑gathering; intelligence claims require corroboration to be actionable without unfairly penalising staff.

7. Timeline highlights (concise)
- 2004: Peter Hansen’s CBC interview; later clarifications and donor discussions.
- 2005: Hansen’s reappointment blocked; retirement.
- 2009: WINEP critique on vetting; disputed teachers’ union election claims.
- 2012: Media reports alleging Islamist dominance in union elections.
- 2023: Israeli intelligence alleges 18 UNRWA workers involved in October 7 attacks.
- 2024 (30 Sept): UNRWA confirms former employee Fatah Sharif had become a Hamas commander; earlier suspension and investigation noted.
- 2025 (Feb): Former hostage alleges detention in a UNRWA facility; UNRWA calls for independent investigation.

8. Recommended next steps for stakeholders
- Commission independent, transparent investigations into specific allegations (both personnel and facility misuse), with public reporting of methods and findings to the extent security allows.
- Review and, where appropriate, strengthen staff vetting, oversight and discipline mechanisms while respecting humanitarian principles, local labour law and non‑discrimination obligations.
- Improve incident reporting protocols and rapid access arrangements to enable timely verification of claims in conflict settings (for example, independent monitors with guaranteed access).
- Enhance communications to donors, host authorities, beneficiaries and staff that explain safeguards, constraints and investigative findings to rebuild trust.
- Consider third‑party audits or external reviews of hiring practices, union election processes and disciplinary records to create an independent baseline of confidence.

9. Conclusions and relevance for Indian strategic culture and policy
- The prolonged contest over UNRWA’s relationship with Hamas illustrates recurring dilemmas for states and international organisations operating where humanitarian action intersects with armed politics:
  - Neutrality is both a legal‑normative requirement and an operational vulnerability when political actors contest humanitarian space.
  - Donor leverage can prompt organisational change but also risks instrumentalising humanitarian bodies for political ends.
  - Intelligence claims without transparent corroboration create policy dilemmas: states may demand remedial action based on classified material, while humanitarian actors insist on due process and verifiable evidence.
- For Indian policymakers thinking about strategic culture and national security, the UNRWA case underscores several lessons:
  - The importance of robust, transparent oversight mechanisms for organisations that provide public goods in volatile settings.
  - The need to reconcile non‑discrimination and local employment imperatives with measures that protect neutrality and security.
  - How donor-state politics can affect multilateral personnel decisions and, by extension, operational effectiveness and legitimacy.
  - The value of independent investigation and verification in resolving contested allegations so that security responses do not inadvertently delegitimise humanitarian operations or harm civilian protection.
- In short, UNRWA’s experience with allegations of Hamas affiliation demonstrates the fraught interface between humanitarian mandates and armed politics — a persistent strategic consideration for any state or actor that relies on or funds international organisations operating in conflict zones.

### UNRWA and Hamas interference in education: a case of contested curricula and operational compromise

Context and claim
- The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) has a long-standing mandate to provide education among other services in Gaza. Over the past two decades UNRWA’s schools have been the locus of recurrent tensions between the Agency’s education programmes — including human rights and gender-equality initiatives — and the governing authorities in Gaza, principally Hamas. A recurrent claim, borne out by several documented incidents, is that Hamas has sought to influence or constrain curricula and textbooks used in UNRWA schools.

Key incidents and chronology
- 2009: Media reporting and UNRWA accounts indicate that Hamas pressure led to the suspension of an intended introduction of Holocaust studies in UNRWA schools. The episode highlighted the sensitivity of introducing externally framed historical material into a politically charged environment.
- 2013 (legal action): Hamas enacted a law requiring gender segregation in Gaza schools for pupils aged nine and older. The law became an explicit instrument for shaping social norms in the education sector; UNRWA has stated that this statutory requirement reportedly does not formally apply to its schools, though the law nonetheless increased pressure on mixed-gender programming.
- 2014 (February): Journalist Elhanan Miller reported that Hamas publicly criticized UNRWA’s human rights curriculum, arguing that it contained values and examples “foreign” to Palestinian culture and objecting specifically to pedagogical emphases on peaceful rather than armed resistance.
- Violent intimidation: Beyond legal and rhetorical pressure, there are recorded instances of violent interference — for example, militants firebombing UNRWA mixed-gender summer camps — underscoring the security risks faced by the Agency, its staff and beneficiaries.

UNRWA’s education policy and responses
- UNRWA’s stated approach is to base its primary education on the Palestinian Authority (PA) curriculum and to use PA textbooks for students sitting public examinations. In parallel, the Agency has developed and implemented a supplementary human rights curriculum, which it says was designed in consultation with local stakeholders and intended for grades 1–9.
- Public posture and negotiation: UNRWA spokespeople, notably Chris Gunness, emphasized a dual obligation — to respect local cultural sensitivities while maintaining adherence to universal human rights principles embedded in UN practice. Initially UNRWA refused to make changes to its human rights teaching in Gaza, asserting its programmatic independence.
- Tactical compromise: After a few days of dispute in 2014, UNRWA temporarily suspended certain books used in grades 7–9 but continued human-rights instruction for grades 1–6 while initiating further discussions with local stakeholders. This partial suspension reflected an operational compromise under local pressure rather than a wholesale policy reversal.

Analytical implications
- Legitimacy and ownership: The episode illuminates the central tension international actors face in contested governance environments: educational content must carry local legitimacy to be sustainable. Using PA textbooks gives UNRWA a degree of legitimacy but also exposes the Agency to the politics of the local curriculum and to competing claims of sovereignty over education.
- Neutrality vs. values promotion: UN agencies often balance a declared neutrality with normative mandates (e.g., human rights, gender equality). When local authorities view these norms as alien or politically threatening, operational continuity can be imperiled.
- Security and protection: Violent attacks on mixed-gender activities and legal impositions like the 2013 segregation law demonstrate the physical and normative risks to staff and beneficiaries. Protection concerns can force programme adjustments that erode programme consistency and effectiveness.
- Donor and diplomatic leverage: Perceived politicization of education in UNRWA schools can prompt donor scrutiny and have funding consequences. Member states may react to allegations of either undue political influence by local actors or of the Agency imposing foreign values, complicating governance and oversight.

Operational lessons and safeguards
- Stakeholder engagement: Early, systematic consultation with parents, teachers, local religious and civic leaders and the local education ministry strengthens legitimacy and reduces the likelihood of abrupt contestation.
- Content review and localization: Robust content-review mechanisms that map universal norms against local cultural and legal contexts can identify points of friction and permit sensitive adaptation without abandoning core human-rights objectives.
- Security planning: Mixed-gender programming or other contested activities require contingency security measures and protective protocols for staff and beneficiaries.
- Donor communication: Transparent, timely communication with donors and member states about curricula, methodologies and local engagement helps insulate programmes from politicized accusations and supports sustained funding.
- Institutional flexibility: Temporary suspensions, phased rollouts, or age-targeted programming can be pragmatic tools to retain programme presence while reducing flashpoints.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and policy
- For Indian policymakers and practitioners engaged in international relief, peacekeeping or educational assistance, the UNRWA–Hamas interaction offers a cautionary model. India’s strategic culture values non-interference, cultural sensitivity and pragmatic engagement; these principles are relevant when Indian actors operate in conflict-affected educational environments. Key takeaways include the need to balance normative commitments (e.g., gender equality) with well-designed local engagement, the importance of operational safeguards to protect staff and beneficiaries, and the diplomatic work required to maintain donor and host-state support when curricular content becomes a theatre of contestation.

Conclusion
- The UNRWA–Hamas episodes are illustrative of how education becomes a battleground for normative authority in contested territories. They demonstrate that international agencies cannot rely on technical expertise alone; legitimacy, security, and sustained dialogue with local actors are indispensable to safeguarding both educational outcomes and humanitarian principles.

### 6.x Summer Camps, Youth Socialization, and Contestation of Influence in Gaza and the West Bank

Summary
- Topic: operation and contestation of summer camps involving UNRWA, Hamas, Islamic Jihad and related controversies.
- Main issues: accusations of moral corruption, gender-mixing, political/religious indoctrination, funding gaps, and competition for youth influence in Gaza and the West Bank.

Background and context
UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) has long provided social services, education and recreational activities for Palestinian refugees. In settings of protracted displacement, summer camps and leisure programming serve multiple functions: child care, psychosocial relief, educational catch-up and socialization. Because these functions shape identities and loyalties, youth programming is inherently political in contested environments such as Gaza and the West Bank. Local authorities, political movements and armed groups therefore treat such programming as both an opportunity and a battleground for influence.

Key actors and their roles
- UNRWA: Provider of refugee-related services; historically operated mixed-gender summer camps and other recreational programs. It has repeatedly defended its practices and denied allegations of political indoctrination tied to its programming.
- Hamas: The governing authority in Gaza; has pressured humanitarian and educational actors to conform to conservative social norms, lobbied to alter curricula and camp management, and operates an extensive network of its own summer camps and youth activities.
- Islamic Jihad: A smaller armed-political actor that, from 2013, also ran summer camps, adding a further actor competing for youth allegiance.
- Israeli media and independent filmmakers: At times have released footage alleging incitement or violent indoctrination in camps; such footage has been contested and requires verification.
- Children and youth: Primary affected population. Following funding shortfalls by UNRWA, Hamas became the direct provider of summer activities for an estimated ~100,000 children and youths.

Timeline of relevant events (selective)
- Pre-2011: UNRWA reportedly operated mixed-gender camps in some locations.
- September 2011: Under pressure from Hamas, UNRWA reportedly made its summer camps single-sex.
- Summer 2012 & Summer 2014: UNRWA did not run summer camps due to lack of funding; gaps emerged in the provision of youth programming.
- 2013: Islamic Jihad expanded its summer-camp activities; Hamas filled gaps and became a primary summer-activity provider for large numbers of youth. In the same year UNRWA canceled a planned Gaza marathon after Hamas banned women from participating. Israeli media released a video claiming that some camps linked to UNRWA taught violence against Israelis; UNRWA denied the footage showed its programs and called the film “grossly misleading.”

Claims, responses and evidentiary issues
- Claims: Hamas and certain media outlets accused UNRWA and other providers of “corrupting” youth (morally or politically), conducting mixed-gender activities contrary to conservative norms, and in some cases of facilitating violent or militant indoctrination.
- Responses: UNRWA denied that the disputed footage depicted its camps, labelled media representations as misleading, and highlighted prior false claims by the same filmmaker. UNRWA also asserted that footage from the West Bank was unaffiliated and that Gaza footage did not contain anti‑Semitic or inflammatory material.
- Verification challenges: Video and documentary evidence released via media channels in conflict settings are often partial, decontextualized or produced with a particular agenda. Independent monitoring and transparent access are necessary to substantiate claims about curricula, speech and activities.

Analysis: implications and interpretive themes
- Competition for youth influence: Summer camps in Gaza and the West Bank have become sites where multiple actors—UN agencies, governing bodies and militant/political groups—compete to socialize children and shape future political orientations. Where humanitarian actors retreat (for instance because of funding shortages), political actors can fill the vacuum and consolidate influence.
- Gender norms and social control: Hamas’ insistence on single-sex programming and its ban on female participation in certain public events reflect its broader governance agenda of conservative gender regulation. These measures can reshape the content and form of youth engagement and limit coeducational social interaction.
- Funding vulnerability and strategic opportunity: Dependence on external funding makes humanitarian youth programming fragile. Funding gaps in 2012 and 2014 coincided with an expansion of alternatives run by political actors; this demonstrates how resource shortfalls can translate into shifts in socialization landscapes.
- Child protection and militarization risk: The politicization of youth programs raises child‑protection concerns. Allegations that camps inculcate violence—even if unproven—underscore the need to assess curricula, instructor backgrounds and the presence/absence of safeguards against militarization.
- Information and attribution risks: Media claims about indoctrination or incitement must be handled cautiously. False attribution can erode NGO credibility and obscure genuine abuses; conversely, lack of transparency can enable real harm to go unaddressed.

Practical recommendations and lessons (including relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy)
- Independent monitoring: Deploy impartial, verifiable monitoring of youth programming where possible (third-party observers, transparent curricula, documented attendance and budgets) to reduce misattribution and detect problematic content early.
- Track influence metrics: For policymakers concerned with long-term stability, collect and analyse data on attendance, funding sources and curricula to understand which actors are shaping youth attitudes.
- Child protection standards: Ensure that any youth programming—humanitarian or governmental—follows international child-protection norms and excludes recruitment or militaristic messaging. Training for staff, safeguarding policies and reporting mechanisms are essential.
- Gender-sensitive programming: Balance respect for local cultural norms with gender equity and access to activities for girls; where single-sex programming is necessary for acceptance, ensure equivalent opportunities and curricula.
- Strategic resilience to funding shocks: Build contingency and local capacity so that civil-society and humanitarian actors can sustain protective services even when donor funding falls short. In the Indian context, resilient social programming can reduce opportunities for malign domestic or transnational actors to gain influence among youth.
- Verification of sources: Governments and analysts should treat media footage and filmmaker claims as starting points for investigation, not as conclusive evidence—especially where accusations could escalate tensions or delegitimize humanitarian actors.

Notes and clarifications
- The name “Ging” appearing in some accounts is unclear and likely a typographic error or misidentification; sources should be checked before relying on that reference.
- UNRWA = United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.
- The case illustrates broader themes of how youth programming becomes an instrument of soft power and contestation in contested polities—lessons that bear on India’s own attention to socialization, community resilience and the protection of children from politicized influence.

Concluding observation
The summer-camp controversies in Gaza and the West Bank demonstrate how service provision, social norms and political competition intersect in fragile settings. For analysts of strategic culture and national security, the episode underscores the security implications of humanitarian gaps, the political salience of youth socialization, and the operational need for rigorous verification and child-protection safeguards in any program that seeks to shape the loyalties of the next generation.

### Case Study: UNRWA — Contested Necessity, Accountability Demands, and Strategic Implications

Summary
- The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) occupies a contested place in debates over humanitarian governance, regional stability, and security. Commentators and former officials have advanced both trenchant critiques—focusing on definitional scope, alleged security breaches, and political effects—and robust defenses emphasizing operational indispensability and the pragmatic reasons states continue to fund the agency. High‑profile episodes, notably the 2014 Gaza war and the October 7, 2023 attacks, amplified scrutiny and renewed calls for transparency, independent investigation, and institutional reform.

1. Critics’ principal contentions
- Definitional and demographic critique: Critics emphasise that UNRWA’s refugee definition—extending refugee status to matrilineal/patrilineal descendants of 1948 refugees within UNRWA’s mandate areas—differs from UNHCR practice and has important political and demographic consequences. Opponents argue this expansion entrenches a refugee identity across generations and complicates political resolution.
- Security and neutrality concerns: Israel and some commentators have alleged that UNRWA facilities and personnel have been used by militant actors (claims have included monitoring by Hamas, presence of weapons in facilities, and staff complicity in violence). Such allegations contend that these practices compromise humanitarian neutrality and pose direct security threats.
- Political effects: Some critics argue the agency’s operations have, intentionally or not, contributed to perpetuating attitudes hostile to Israel’s existence, thereby affecting the political and security environment in Gaza and other areas where UNRWA operates.
- Operational response: Even among critics there is recognition of UNRWA’s operational centrality; Israel, for instance, has not pursued wholesale abolition because it lacks a credible replacement able to deliver services at scale during crises.

2. Defenders’ arguments and pragmatic realities
- Stabilizing function: Defenders stress UNRWA’s core mandate—education, primary health, social services, and emergency relief—to registered Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. In acute crises the agency provides life‑saving services and acts as a stabilising institution.
- Funding pragmatism: As Karen Koning AbuZayd (former UNRWA Commissioner‑General) argued (Middle East Monitor, April 2012), even those who critique the agency recognize its practical necessity and therefore continue to ensure its funding. This pragmatic support is motivated by the need to prevent immediate humanitarian collapse and wider regional instability.
- Institutional safeguards and limitations: Supporters point to internal investigations, donor oversight mechanisms, and revisions to operating procedures as existing (if sometimes imperfect) mechanisms through which accountability can be pursued without dismantling critical services.

3. Punctuating events that sharpen contestation
- 2014 Gaza war: The agency’s role during the 2014 conflict—administering aid and shelter for over 200,000 internally displaced Gazans—illustrated both its operational indispensability and the difficulty of maintaining neutrality under intense military and political pressure.
- October 7, 2023 and subsequent allegations: The October 7 attacks triggered renewed and intensified allegations. Journalists (e.g., David Horovitz) and political actors catalogued claims that some UNRWA staff had ties to militant groups or were complicit in atrocities. Such allegations, particularly when widely reported, intensified calls from some quarters for donor reviews, suspensions of funding, and independent investigations.

4. Accountability, investigative necessity, and reform proposals
- Need for robust investigation: Serious allegations—especially those touching on complicity in violence—require independent, transparent, well‑resourced investigations to establish facts, attribute responsibility, and recommend remedial measures. Absent credible inquiries, politicised narratives tend to harden.
- Commonly proposed reforms: Proposals advanced in donor capitals and analyst circles include enhanced transparency (public reporting of investigative findings), stricter staff vetting and monitoring, independent audits of facilities, clearer protocols for protection of humanitarian premises, and strengthened liaison mechanisms with host authorities and security actors.
- Funding leverage and humanitarian risk: Donor suspensions or conditional funding responses are recurrent policy tools. While they can pressure institutional reform, they also risk immediate gaps in essential services, exposing large refugee populations to acute humanitarian needs.

5. Legal and operational distinctions: UNRWA vs UNHCR
- Mandate differences: UNRWA’s geographically and historically specific mandate (palestinian refugees in certain areas) and its policy of recognising descendants as refugees distinguish it from UNHCR’s global refugee framework. These technical differences are politically salient because they shape entitlements, record‑keeping, and long‑term demographic accounting.
- Practical consequence: Policy debates over definitions are not merely semantic; they determine who receives services, how agencies plan for multi‑generational assistance, and how political actors frame prospects for durable solutions.

6. Strategic and normative implications for India’s security policy
- Lesson for strategic culture: UNRWA exemplifies the tension between humanitarian necessity and security/rule‑of‑law concerns—tensions that India’s strategic community must weigh when engaging with multilateral humanitarian actors in its neighbourhood and beyond.
- Operational readiness and diplomatic positioning: For India, which balances principles of sovereignty, non‑intervention, and support for multilateral institutions, the UNRWA case suggests the need to: (a) advocate for rigorous accountability mechanisms in international aid actors; (b) ensure continuity of relief while avoiding uncritical support of institutions alleged to be compromised; and (c) develop contingency plans for partner capacity shortfalls in crisis scenarios.
- Donor leverage and geopolitical calculus: Decisions on funding or political critique of international agencies carry broader geopolitical consequences. India’s posture—whether as a donor, partner, or convenor—must weigh immediate humanitarian impact against longer‑term strategic objectives and normative commitments to international law and conflict resolution.

Conclusion: balancing necessity and accountability
- The UNRWA debate is emblematic of broader dilemmas inherent in international humanitarian governance: agencies that become indispensable through service delivery are vulnerable to politicisation, face acute accountability pressures, and operate under constraints that complicate neutrality in conflict zones. The way forward lies not in binary choices of abolition versus unconditional support, but in a calibrated approach: independent investigations where warranted, targeted reforms to strengthen transparency and staff oversight, and contingency planning to mitigate humanitarian risk if institutional funding or operations are disrupted. For policymakers—India included—the case underlines the centrality of combining principled multilateral engagement with pragmatic institutional scrutiny.

### Repeated calls for investigation by the United States

Overview  
The United States’ recurrent scrutiny of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) exemplifies how donor states translate security concerns, accountability expectations, and political considerations into sustained oversight of a multilateral relief agency. U.S. actions — ranging from donor-imposed monitoring mechanisms to public demands for independent inquiry and episodic suspension of funds — reflect both genuine accountability functions and the leverage that major funders exercise over international organisations. These interventions have material consequences for UNRWA’s reputation, operations and for the refugee populations dependent on its services.

Key events and oversight measures
- Donor-imposed monitoring: The United States financed a programme of “Operations Support Officers” whose task was to perform random and unannounced inspections of UNRWA facilities. This form of direct, on-the-ground monitoring was intended to deter and detect any militant use of humanitarian premises and to reassure U.S. taxpayers that funds were not facilitating violence.
- 2004 GAO inquiry: At the behest of Congress, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigated media claims that U.S. funding to UNRWA had supported individuals with links to militant activity. The GAO, the federal accountability office that audits use of government funds, identified several irregularities in UNRWA’s vetting, employment records and personnel processing — findings that highlighted administrative weaknesses rather than proving systematic complicity.
- 2014 congressional pressure: In August 2014, several U.S. Senators called for an impartial investigation into allegations that UNRWA had participated in or been complicit with Hamas during the Gaza–Israel hostilities. Their letter framed the issue as a taxpayer-rights and humanitarian-neutrality concern: U.S. citizens, they argued, should know whether UNRWA was fulfilling its impartial humanitarian mandate or taking sides in the conflict.
- State Department response: In response to such allegations, the U.S. State Department publicly encouraged the United Nations to take corrective steps. This included support for deploying munitions experts to search for weapons caches in UNRWA facilities and repeated messaging that UN facilities, staff and civilians must not be used as shields for militants. The Department committed to consultations with UN leadership and other donors on remedial measures.
- 2018 funding cuts: The Trump administration substantially reduced U.S. contributions to UNRWA. Official rationales cited inadequate burden sharing among donors, perceived unsustainable fiscal practices within UNRWA and contested claims about the bona fides of many under UNRWA’s care (i.e., political debate over who qualifies as a Palestinian refugee).
- 2021 restoration of funding: The Biden administration reversed course and restored U.S. assistance to UNRWA. By 2024, renewed U.S. contributions to the agency amounted to nearly US$1 billion in the aggregate, signalling a political recalibration that sought to reconcile humanitarian obligations with accountability demands.
- 2024 funding halt: During the 2024 Gaza war, the Biden administration again halted funding following Israeli allegations that some UNRWA staff participated in the October 7 attacks. The pause illustrated how rapidly donor posture can shift in response to allegations emerging from acute hostilities.

Contextual points
- The GAO’s role: The GAO functions as the principal U.S. oversight mechanism for federal expenditures; its investigations can identify administrative shortcomings and recommend procedural reforms but do not substitute for criminal or independent international inquiry.
- Donor-driven monitoring: Measures such as Operations Support Officers are emblematic of donor attempts to protect the neutrality of humanitarian assets while preserving political legitimacy at home. Such measures can detect violations but may also strain relationships between donors, UN agencies and host authorities.
- Recurrence during conflict: Accusations against UNRWA have tended to resurface during or after large-scale hostilities in Gaza, reflecting the linkage between political-military crises and scrutiny of humanitarian actors operating in contested environments.
- Burden sharing and leverage: “Burden sharing” denotes how the financial responsibility for humanitarian operations is distributed among donor states. Perceived shortfalls in burden sharing give large donors political justifications to withhold or condition funds, amplifying their influence over agency practices.
- Refugee definition debate: Disputes about who qualifies as a Palestinian refugee — and whether individuals served by UNRWA are “bona fide” refugees — are both technical and deeply political, bearing directly on the scale of the agency’s mandate and on donor willingness to finance it.
- Humanitarian cost: Interruptions in UNRWA funding risk immediate disruption of education, health services and social safety nets for large refugee populations in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
- Restoration as recalibration: The return of funds after suspensions often reflects balancing of humanitarian imperatives against security and political concerns; it also shows that unilateral cuts rarely resolve underlying governance or accountability problems.

Implications for UNRWA and for donors
- Reputational risk and donor confidence: Repeated allegations, even when not conclusively proven, increase reputational vulnerability and undermine donor confidence, potentially prompting stricter conditionality or long-term reductions in support.
- Operational disruption: Funding suspensions and heightened oversight can disrupt service delivery, aggravate humanitarian need and complicate coordination with host authorities and other actors on the ground.
- Institutional relations and sovereignty: Intensive, donor-led oversight (inspections, forensic searches for weapons) can enhance accountability but also generate tensions with UN institutional autonomy and with host governments that view external intrusions as infringements on sovereignty or neutrality.

Recommendations (policy and operational)
- Independent, transparent investigation: Commission a truly independent and transparent inquiry — with agreed terms of reference and participation from impartial experts — to establish facts, make findings public and recommend systemic reforms where necessary. Such a process would help restore credibility if it is demonstrably impartial and rigorous.
- Strengthen vetting and personnel systems: UNRWA should strengthen vetting procedures, maintain robust employment records, and implement improved human-resources controls to reduce opportunities for misuse of positions.
- Improve asset and inventory controls: Reinforce asset management — including regular, documented inventories and rapid-response protocols for discovery of weapons caches — and make these procedures visible to donors and host authorities.
- Enhance reporting and transparency: Establish routine, public reporting to donors on compliance, remedial measures taken, and outcomes of inspections, while protecting legitimate staff confidentiality and operational security.
- Multilateralise burden sharing and oversight: Encourage coordinated donor oversight and pooled funding mechanisms to diminish the outsized political leverage of any single contributor and to foster collective responsibility for UNRWA’s operational sustainability.
- Rapid remedial capacity: Develop rapid-response teams (internal and external) to investigate allegations, secure sites, and implement corrective measures promptly to prevent escalation and preserve humanitarian services.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national-security policy
For Indian policymakers and analysts, the UNRWA case offers several lessons germane to strategic culture and national-security calculus:
- Donor leverage over multilateral agencies can produce swift policy outcomes; India’s growing role as a middle-power donor requires awareness of how conditionality and oversight affects both operational effectiveness and political narratives.
- Humanitarian assistance in conflict zones sits at the interface of security and policy: accountability failures can have strategic repercussions, while funding suspensions can produce second-order security risks (instability, radicalisation).
- Multilateral burden sharing and institutional resilience matter: India’s endorsement of collective approaches to humanitarian challenges—rather than unilateral conditionality—aligns with a strategic preference for stable, rules-based multilateralism that preserves humanitarian space while upholding accountability.

Concluding remark  
The pattern of repeated U.S. demands for investigation into UNRWA illustrates the tension at the heart of modern humanitarian diplomacy: donors legitimately seek accountability for funds they furnish, but the politics of conditionality and the optics of unilateral leverage can undermine the operational viability and neutrality of multilateral agencies. Resolving that tension requires transparent, independent inquiry, systemic institutional reform, and multilateral arrangements that spread both responsibility and oversight equitably.

### Case Study: The 2009 Lindsay Critique of UNRWA — Neutrality, Accountability and the Politics of International Agencies

Summary  
In 2009 James G. Lindsay, a former general counsel of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), published an analytic brief for the Washington Institute for Near East Policy (WINEP) proposing a set of operational reforms for UNRWA. The paper urged organizational depoliticization, tighter personnel vetting, and external review of school curricula. UNRWA officials publicly rejected the paper as biased and inaccurate, while Lindsay countered that he had sought but been denied substantive engagement from the agency. The episode crystallises recurring dilemmas for multilateral agencies: how to preserve operational neutrality while addressing security concerns, how outside critiques and think‑tank affiliations shape perceptions of bias, and how donor politics mediate institutional reform.

Source, purpose and institutional framing
- Author and venue: James G. Lindsay, drawing on his prior tenure as UNRWA’s general counsel, authored the paper for WINEP, a US‑based Near East policy think tank. The venue and authorial background shaped both the credibility and the perceived political framing of the critique.
- Stated purpose: to identify operational weaknesses and to recommend concrete changes intended to strengthen UNRWA’s neutrality, security and educational practices.

Lindsay’s principal recommendations (paraphrase)
- Restrict public pronouncements to humanitarian matters: Lindsay argued that UNRWA should refrain from “one‑sided political statements” and limit public commentary to the humanitarian functions that are central to its mandate.
- Strengthen personnel and beneficiary vetting: he recommended more robust measures to ensure that UNRWA neither employs nor provides services and benefits to persons engaged in terrorism or serious criminality.
- Outsource textbook review to a neutral authority: Lindsay proposed that UNESCO or another neutral body should provide balanced, non‑discriminatory school textbooks for UNRWA schools to remove contested political messaging from curricula.

UNRWA’s rebuttal and its grounds
- Institutional response: Andrew Whitley (director, UNRWA New York representative office) and Chris Gunness (UNRWA Jerusalem spokesperson) publicly challenged the analysis as biased, selectively sourced and lacking important operational context.
- Central critique: UNRWA officials argued that Lindsay’s paper omitted the central fact of occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. They contended that omitting this context produced an imbalanced narrative that overstated agency culpability and under‑appreciated structural constraints imposed by the occupation.
- Reliability and sourcing: UNRWA characterised the paper as relying on limited sources and failing to account for internal procedures, oversight mechanisms and the complex operating environment in which UNRWA functions.

Lindsay’s reply on process
- Claim of non‑engagement: Lindsay stated he repeatedly sought UNRWA’s input and corrections but that the agency declined to identify specific weaknesses or to participate in a substantive exchange. He said, therefore, that his paper lacked formal agency input or correction.
- How this matters: whether the paper’s factual record is partial turns in part on the extent to which UNRWA cooperated with external review—an ambiguity that itself becomes a point of contention.

Analytical reading: tensions and implications
- Neutrality versus advocacy: Lindsay’s first recommendation presses a classic tension—should field agencies maintain strict operational neutrality in public discourse, or do they have a legitimate advocacy role when political structures are integrally linked to humanitarian conditions? Limiting statements to “humanitarian issues” may reduce political backlash but can also constrain the agency’s ability to explain root causes relevant to its mandate.
- Security and vetting trade‑offs: calls to tighten vetting procedures respond to donor concerns about misuse of resources and security. But implementation is technically and politically difficult—sourcing reliable intelligence, protecting due process, and operating in territories with contested sovereignty complicate straightforward vetting regimes.
- Educational content as a flashpoint: curriculum content has symbolic and practical effects on narratives and loyalties. Proposals to involve UNESCO reflect a desire for an external, neutral arbiter, yet outsourcing curriculum control raises sovereignty, pedagogical, and political questions about who defines neutrality.
- Perceptions of bias: WINEP’s Washington base and policy orientation mean the report’s reception was filtered through geopolitical lenses; the same recommendations can be perceived as technocratic reform or as politically motivated pressure, depending on the audience.
- Donor politics and institutional behaviour: allegations about employment of militants or problematic textbooks have immediate consequences for donor confidence and funding decisions. This creates incentives for both external scrutiny and defensive institutional posture by agencies.

Relevance for states’ strategic cultures — implications for India
- Managing engagement with multilateral agencies: the episode demonstrates how states that are both donors and users of multilateral services must calibrate demands for transparency and accountability against the need to preserve operational effectiveness. For India—an evolving donor and participant in UN fora—the lesson is to design engagement modalities that press for verifiable standards (vetting, audit, curricula review) while respecting operational constraints and local political contexts.
- Balancing neutrality and advocacy in national posture: India’s own strategic culture, which values non‑alignment and principled multilateralism, can draw from this case to develop policy prescriptions on how Indian missions should evaluate and, when necessary, push for reforms in international agencies without inducing politicisation that hampers service delivery.
- Institutional learning and conditionality: the dispute illustrates how donor conditionality (explicit or implicit) affects multilateral behaviour. India’s policy toolkit can combine technical assistance (e.g., supporting neutral curriculum review mechanisms) with diplomatic engagement to promote reforms that enhance both accountability and legitimacy.
- Transparency as strategic practice: the contested claim about UNRWA’s unwillingness to engage underscores the strategic value of openness. States and agencies that proactively share information, invite external review, and clarify constraints reduce space for escalatory accusations that can be exploited in broader geopolitical contests.

Conclusion
The Lindsay–UNRWA exchange is more than a localized policy quarrel: it is emblematic of broader structural dilemmas facing international organisations operating in politicised environments. For analysts of national security and strategic culture, the episode provides a compact case study of how questions of neutrality, accountability, donor influence and educational narratives intersect—and how states, including India, must craft policies that promote credible reform without undermining the essential humanitarian functions of multilateral agencies.

### Case Study: The 2014 UNRWA “Reform Initiative” and Lessons for Strategic Engagement with International Organizations

Background
- UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East) is the UN agency established in 1949 to provide basic services—education, health, relief and social services—to registered Palestinian refugees across Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Its mandate and unique operational model make it a frequent focus of political contestation and donor scrutiny.

The 2014 Initiative: announcement and stated purpose
- In March 2014 the Center for Near East Policy Research announced an initiative it framed as a campaign for “UNRWA reform.” The stated tactic was to compile and publicize documentation of alleged problems within UNRWA’s governance and operations, and to use those materials to press for changes by targeting the Agency’s donors.

Actors and actor-profiles
- Center for Near East Policy Research: a research and investigative journalism organization that operates, among other vehicles, the Israel Resource News Agency. Its work blends investigative claims with advocacy aimed at reshaping donor perceptions of UNRWA.
- David Bedein: identified as the initiative’s primary leader. UNRWA publicly accused Bedein of fabricating some of the material he published—a contested claim that highlights the broader credibility battle that often accompanies such campaigns.
- Middle East Forum: a U.S.-based conservative think tank that collaborated with the Center on aspects of the campaign. The Forum’s publication, Middle East Quarterly, devoted an issue to UNRWA-related critiques, illustrating how think tanks and journals can help amplify advocacy narratives.

Partnerships and amplification
- The initiative was not a solitary project. It leveraged partnerships with think tanks, sympathetic media outlets, and researchers to compile dossiers and to disseminate them to influential audiences. These partnerships are significant because they convert documentary claims into policy pressure through publication, briefings, and targeted outreach to donors.

Tactics and target audiences
- Primary tactic: documentation and publicity—gathering allegations about UNRWA practices and presenting them in forms intended to be persuasive to donor governments and non-state funders.
- Target audience: sponsor nations, international organizations and other donors. The explicit strategic logic is to shape donor perceptions so that funding conditions, oversight demands, or funding levels are altered.

Objectives and possible outcomes
- Immediate objective: increase donor demands for accountability and oversight of UNRWA. The campaign aims to translate reputational pressure into concrete policy responses (enhanced audits, conditionality, or funding restrictions).
- Potential impacts on the ground: if successful, pressure could lead to restructuring, tighter oversight, funding cuts or reallocation of programs—outcomes that can materially affect service delivery to refugees. The policy chain runs from advocacy claims → donor reaction → operational change → consequences for beneficiaries and regional politics.

Credibility, contestation, and analytical cautions
- UNRWA’s rebuttal—that some of the initiative’s materials were fabricated—illustrates a central analytic imperative: claims produced by advocacy organizations must be cross-checked against independent audits, UN internal inquiries, and multiple corroborating sources.
- Actor profiles matter: the Middle East Forum’s conservative orientation and the Center’s political commitments shape the framing and selection of evidence. Analysts should separate motive and framing from empirical claims, testing the latter against neutral verification mechanisms.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Precedent for donor leverage: the initiative demonstrates how external actors seek to influence multilateral organizations via donor pressure. For India—now an increasingly prominent donor and participant in multilateral fora—this is a reminder that funding is a lever of influence but also a vulnerability: India’s contributions may be used as channels for partisan contestation unless accompanied by clear institutional engagement strategies.
- Information warfare and reputational diplomacy: campaigns that assemble and publicize allegations can rapidly change the policy environment. India’s strategic culture, which prizes calibrated and long-term engagement, may need to strengthen institutional capacities for rapid verification, public diplomacy, and coalition-building to defend or reform multilateral partners it supports.
- Policy implications: when India engages multilaterally (whether in development, peacekeeping, or humanitarian assistance), it should:
  - Insist on transparent, independent audit mechanisms for partners it funds;
  - Build coalitions of like-minded donors to reduce asymmetric pressure;
  - Maintain credible in-house research and verification capacities to evaluate third-party claims before altering funding or policy.
- Broader strategic point: initiatives like the 2014 campaign sit within larger geopolitical contests over narrative control in contentious regions. For Indian policymakers, the lesson is both practical (manage donor leverage and verification) and normative (balance support for effective multilateralism with safeguards against politicized instrumentalization of funding).

Concluding analytical note
- The 2014 UNRWA reform initiative is a compact example of how advocacy coalitions attempt to influence multilateral institutions by targeting donors with curated documentation. Assessing such efforts demands careful source vetting, attention to actor motives, and an understanding of how donor responses translate into operational consequences. For states such as India that are deepening their multilateral engagements, the case underscores the need for institutional resilience, principled transparency, and strategic diplomacy to manage both reputational risks and the potential fallout for beneficiaries on the ground.

### EU Conditionality on UNRWA Funding (2021–2024)

Context and actors
- In September 2021 the European Parliament's Budgetary Control Committee intervened in the EU’s financial relationship with UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees), approving a recommendation to withhold a specific disbursement.
- The Committee’s action targeted a tranche of 20 million euros and attached explicit conditions to its release. The measure is an example of parliamentary budgetary oversight being used as leverage over an international organisation’s practices.

What the Committee demanded
- The withholding was conditioned on immediate and verifiable changes to UNRWA’s education curriculum. The Parliament’s resolution expressed concern that some Palestinian school textbooks and materials used in UNRWA-run schools contained content that amounted to hate speech or promoted violence.
- The Committee insisted UNRWA address those concerns “in full transparency,” making curriculum content and any remedial steps available for external review.
- The resolution referenced adherence to “UN values,” explicitly requiring that educational content must neither encourage hatred nor incite violence.

Specific allegations and framing
- The parliamentary text singled out alleged instances of hateful or violent content as being taught in schools under UNRWA auspices. The accusation was not solely about abstract policy failings but pointed to concrete pedagogical materials and classroom content.
- By tying the accusation to EU funding, the Committee framed conditionality as a normative enforcement mechanism—donor standards as a corrective to perceived violations of universal values embedded in UN mandates.

Institutional mechanics and limits
- The Budgetary Control Committee is an important actor in EU budget oversight and can recommend withholding funds; however, final EU funding decisions typically involve additional institutional steps (European Commission, Council, possibly the full Parliament), and member states’ positions also shape outcomes.
- The 20 million euros represented a specific tranche within a larger corpus of EU and member-state contributions to UNRWA; the EU’s total support is multi-channel and multiyear, so conditionality on one tranche does not automatically equate to a blanket suspension of all assistance.

Subsequent development: reinstatement in 2024
- On 1 March 2024 EU funding for UNRWA was formally reinstated. The reinstatement signals that, over the intervening period, either UNRWA provided assurances and/or concrete reforms acceptable to EU decision-makers, or political calculations within EU institutions and member states shifted.
- The outline does not specify which exact EU body or legal instrument effected the reinstatement; the move could reflect a negotiated settlement, verification of remedial steps, or changing geopolitical priorities.

Implications and analytical observations
- Conditionality as a donor lever: Conditioning funds on educational content is a familiar mechanism through which donors seek to influence the practices of international agencies. It combines normative demands (adherence to specified values) with material incentives (continued funding), and thus operates both as a stick and a carrot.
- Operational consequences: Withholding even a tranche of funds from UNRWA has practical consequences for refugee education delivery, teacher salaries, resource procurement, and the continuity of classroom instruction. These operational effects impose pressure for rapid institutional responses but can also exacerbate vulnerabilities among beneficiary populations.
- Reputational and diplomatic effects: The parliamentary move increased reputational pressure on UNRWA and inserted the EU explicitly into a politically sensitive debate about curriculum and identity in the Israeli–Palestinian context. Such actions can complicate EU relations with the parties on the ground and shape perceptions among other donors.
- Political interpretation of reinstatement: Reinstatement could be read as vindication of UNRWA after corrective measures, or as evidence that strategic/ humanitarian imperatives and donor coordination outweighed prior concerns. It underscores how donor politics, verification capacity, and shifting geopolitical contexts determine the lifecycle of conditionality.

Relevance to strategic culture and national security policy (brief analytical tie-in)
- For states crafting strategic culture and foreign-aid policy—India among them—the EU–UNRWA episode is instructive. It illustrates how donor states use financial oversight to project normative preferences into contested social spheres (education and identity formation), and how such measures can have downstream security consequences by affecting stability, grievance dynamics, and local legitimacy.
- India’s own approach to multilateral engagement and development diplomacy, which traditionally emphasizes sovereignty and non-interference but has grown more assertive in normative arenas (peacekeeping, climate finance, infrastructure), must weigh the trade-offs visible here: normative leverage versus operational continuity and local political fallout.
- Policymakers concerned with national security should note that conditionality affecting socialisation institutions (schools, curricula) can magnify or attenuate long-term radicalisation risks; donors therefore confront a classic security-development tension when seeking to influence educational content abroad.

Outstanding questions and avenues for further research
- What specific curriculum changes or formal assurances did UNRWA provide between 2021 and 2024 to satisfy EU concerns?
- Was the 20 million euro tranche ultimately disbursed in full, and were there monitoring or verification conditions attached to its release?
- Did other major donors take parallel actions, public statements, or conditionalities during the same period, and how did donor coordination (or lack thereof) affect outcomes?
- Which EU body formally authorised the 1 March 2024 reinstatement, and what justification or evidentiary record accompanied that decision?

Concise conclusion
- The 2021 decision by the European Parliament’s Budgetary Control Committee to withhold 20 million euros from UNRWA, conditioned on curriculum reform, exemplifies how budgetary oversight can be mobilised to impose normative standards on international organisations. The 2024 reinstatement underscores the contingent, negotiated nature of such conditionalities and highlights the practical, reputational, and diplomatic stakes that donor actions impose on humanitarian and education services in conflict-affected settings.

### 6.x UNRWA and Israel after the Six‑Day War: the Comay–Michelmore Exchange and its Contemporary Significance

Background and context
- In the immediate aftermath of the 1967 Six‑Day War, Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza. Faced with the administrative and humanitarian consequences, Israeli authorities asked the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to continue its assistance programs in those territories and offered to facilitate UNRWA’s work.
- UNRWA itself is a specialised relief and service agency created in 1949 specifically to assist Palestine refugees. Its mandate and institutional architecture differ from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which covers other global refugee populations. UNRWA’s limited, population‑specific mandate, and the political sensitivity of the refugees it serves, frame the distinctive operational and political dilemmas examined below.

The Comay–Michelmore Exchange (14 June 1967)
- The practical basis for UNRWA’s post‑war dealings with Israel was established by an exchange of letters dated 14 June 1967 between Laurence Michelmore, then UNRWA Commissioner‑General, and Michael Comay, political advisor to the Israeli Foreign Minister. The correspondence is commonly known as the Comay–Michelmore Exchange of Letters.
- Michelmore’s letter reiterated an earlier verbal understanding: UNRWA would continue relief and assistance to Palestine refugees in the West Bank and Gaza with the cooperation of Israeli authorities. Crucially, Michelmore inserted an operational caveat — that any facilitation from Israel would be provided “to the best of its ability” but might be limited by “regulations or arrangements necessitated by military security considerations.”
- Comay’s reply declared that the letters constituted a provisional agreement between UNRWA and the Government of Israel, operative until superseded or cancelled by further arrangement. This exchange thus created a working, administrative arrangement rather than a formal treaty or permanent legal instrument.

Legal and operational character
- The Comay–Michelmore correspondence is administrative and provisional in nature. It established a modus vivendi for humanitarian operations within a contested and occupied environment, but it did not convert into a long‑term legal framework binding in the treaty sense. Because the arrangement could be changed or rescinded by either party, it left legal ambiguity about the permanence and scope of UNRWA’s authorities.
- Operationally, the arrangement institutionalised an uneasy balance: UNRWA’s humanitarian mandate required access and continuity of service, while Israeli security imperatives justified coordination, restrictions and, at times, interference. Baruch Spiegel’s aphorism — an “uneasy marriage of convenience” between unlikely partners — captures the persistent tension between humanitarian continuity and political control.

Operational impact and practical constraints
- Israeli facilitation has often come accompanied by coordination demands and security constraints that materially affect UNRWA programming. Practical impediments include movement restrictions, checkpoints, permits, and limitations on certain categories of activities in occupied areas. Such constraints complicate needs assessments, impede timely delivery of services, and shape UNRWA’s operational choices.
- The provisional nature of the arrangement means operational access has been contingent on political and security judgments; this contingency shapes the agency’s risk calculus and planning horizons.

Criticisms, allegations and responses
- Over decades, UNRWA has been the subject of sustained criticism by Israeli government officials and segments of Israeli public opinion. Key allegations have included claims that some UNRWA staff were involved with Palestinian militant groups — notably Hamas — or that UNRWA’s reporting and public positions exhibited anti‑Israel bias.
- Israeli media, for example, accused former UNRWA Commissioner‑General Peter Hansen (1996–2005) of producing biased and exaggerated reports hostile to Israel. Such allegations are an enduring feature of the political contest over the refugee issue.
- UNRWA and the UN system have responded to specific allegations with internal investigations and, where misconduct is substantiated, disciplinary measures. Nevertheless, charge and countercharge tend to feed political narratives rather than produce conclusive institutional settlements, because operational oversight in contested environments is inherently difficult.

Political framing and funding vulnerability
- Interpretations of UNRWA’s role are deeply politicised. For some actors the agency is an essential humanitarian actor that sustains vulnerable populations; for others it is an instrument that perpetuates the refugee issue and, by implication, political claims regarding the Israeli‑Palestinian conflict.
- These contested interpretations have real effects on donor behaviour. Political criticisms and security‑related allegations can—and have—affected donor confidence and funding flows, creating budgetary fragility for an agency whose mandate depends on unconventional, long‑term political compromises.

Stakeholders and the policy ecosystem
- The principal stakeholders in this arrangement include UNRWA leadership (the Commissioner‑General and senior managers), the Israeli government and military authorities who exercise de facto control over territories, Palestinian refugees and local communities who are the primary beneficiaries and political actors, and UN member‑state donors whose financial support sustains operations.
- Each actor has distinct incentives: UNRWA seeks operational continuity and protection of neutrality; Israel seeks security and political control; donors seek accountability and impact; refugees seek services and protection. The alignment—and misalignment—of these incentives shapes operational outcomes.

Implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture and policy
- For policymakers concerned with the intersection of national security and humanitarian action, the Comay–Michelmore case offers three pragmatic lessons relevant to India’s strategic culture:
  1. Provisional operational agreements can secure short‑term humanitarian access but leave long‑term legal ambiguity. India’s engagement with international organisations in contested settings should therefore seek clarity on legal status, termination clauses and oversight mechanisms to avoid contingent dependencies.
  2. Security coordination is unavoidable in contested environments; however, excessive operational controls can erode perceived neutrality and legitimacy of humanitarian actors. Indian policy—whether as a troop contributor, donor or host state—should balance legitimate security needs with procedural safeguards that protect humanitarian impartiality.
  3. Political narratives shape funding and institutional resilience. India’s diplomatic posture should recognise that criticisms (rightly or wrongly grounded) can have outsized effects on donor confidence; thus, transparent accountability mechanisms and rapid response to substantiated misconduct are essential to maintain credibility.
- In sum, the Israel–UNRWA post‑1967 relationship exemplifies how humanitarian institutions operate under the shadow of occupation and politics. For states like India, which engage with international organisations across diverse theatres, the episode underscores the need to design engagements that protect humanitarian effectiveness while respecting legitimate security concerns and preserving institutional legitimacy.

### Case study: Israel’s 2024–25 legislation ordering UNRWA to cease activities — legal, operational and strategic implications

This episode — the Knesset’s October 2024 legislation ordering the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) to cease “any activity” in territories claimed by Israel and the Israeli government’s formal termination of collaboration beginning 30 January 2025 — illuminates how domestic law, international institutions and humanitarian operations collide in contested territories. It is instructive for students of strategic culture because it shows how national security imperatives, legal posturing and international reputational management interact, with material consequences for civilians and third‑state policy choices.

1. Chronology and core facts
- 28 October 2024: The Knesset passed legislation directing UNRWA to cease all activities in territories Israel claims, with a 90‑day window for compliance. The measure asserts Israeli authority over the affected areas by treating UNRWA presence there as unlawful.
- 30 January 2025: The Israeli government’s announced date for terminating collaboration, communication and contact with UNRWA — the operational point at which the ban takes effect.
- December 2024: In response to the impending ban, the UN General Assembly (UNGA) voted to request an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on “Obligations of Israel in relation to the Presence and Activities of the United Nations, Other International Organizations and Third States in and in relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory.”
- Domestic political framing: Israel’s foreign minister, Gideon Sa’ar, publicly criticised the UNGA’s move, arguing the UN and UNRWA — rather than Israel — deserved scrutiny; this rhetoric framed the dispute as an institutional accountability issue rather than solely a legal conflict.

2. Legal and institutional context
- UNRWA’s role: UNRWA is the UN agency mandated to provide education, health, social services and emergency relief to Palestinian refugees. Its operational footprint is extensive, and its activities are central to day‑to‑day humanitarian and social governance in the territories concerned.
- Domestic bans on UN agencies are rare. A state’s unilateral decision to bar a UN agency within a territory raises immediate questions about:
  - obligations under the UN Charter (including cooperation with UN organs and agencies);
  - obligations under international humanitarian law applicable to occupations; and
  - treaty and customary international law that protect humanitarian access.
- UNGA advisory opinion mechanism (Article 96): advisory opinions of the ICJ are non‑binding, but they carry strong legal and political authority. They can clarify states’ obligations and shape international responses even if they cannot themselves compel compliance.

3. Immediate operational and humanitarian consequences
- Disruption risk: The ban threatens to interrupt essential services — education, primary health care, social protection and emergency relief — for large numbers of Palestinian refugees. The operational impact would be immediate in many localities.
- Protection consequences: Service disruption heightens protection risks for vulnerable populations (children, the elderly, displaced persons) and may increase instability, displacement and humanitarian need.
- Alternatives are problematic: routing aid through non‑UN NGOs, third‑state channels, or relocalising UNRWA functions would be legally and logistically complex, slower, and likely less effective. These alternatives also carry political and security risks in contested areas.

4. The international legal escalation: UNGA → ICJ
- Legal escalation rationale: The UNGA’s December 2024 request to the ICJ is an attempt to secure an authoritative legal interpretation of states’ and organisations’ rights and duties regarding the presence and activities of UN organs and third states in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
- Effects of an advisory opinion: Although non‑binding, an ICJ advisory opinion could:
  - clarify the content of Israel’s international obligations and the legal status of UN/agency activities;
  - influence other organs of the UN, donor states and international courts; and
  - increase diplomatic and political pressure on Israel or on third states to adapt their behaviour (funding, recognition, cooperation).
- Limits: The opinion could not directly reverse Israeli domestic legislation or force operational resumption, though it would change the normative and reputational environment.

5. Diplomatic and strategic dimensions
- Clash of legal fora: This dispute exemplifies a recurring dynamic — domestic legal measures framed as sovereign prerogative creating friction with international institutions and fora. States under security pressures may prefer domestic remedies; international actors seek legal and normative adjudication.
- Third‑state and donor calculus: Donor countries and third states face dilemmas: continuing funding via UNRWA risks practical and reputational association with an organisation excluded from parts of the territory; withdrawing funds would exacerbate humanitarian suffering; rerouting funds raises new legal and security questions. Some states may respond with sanctions, diplomatic protests, conditional funding, or the creation of alternative channels — all decisions that reflect strategic priorities and domestic politics.
- Diplomatic fallout: The ban aggravates tensions between Israel and the UN system and can alter bilateral ties with states that champion UN involvement, potentially affecting cooperation in other areas (security, intelligence sharing, trade).

6. Implications for strategic culture and national security policy (lessons for India)
- Precedent sensitivity: India’s strategic culture emphasises respect for sovereignty and pragmatic space for policy autonomy, but it also values multilateralism as a tool of international legitimacy. This case is a reminder that domestic legal moves that impede UN operations can produce broad international backlash and operational uncertainty.
- Humanitarian‑security trade‑offs: States must weigh short‑term security or political gains from restricting international organisations against medium‑term costs: humanitarian crises, reputational loss, pressure from partners, and the erosion of multilateral mechanisms that can be useful in crises involving Indian interests.
- Policy options for India (framework to consider):
  - principled multilateralism: underscore the importance of predictable humanitarian access and adherence to international legal norms while maintaining dialogue with partners;
  - calibrated diplomatic responses: push for legal clarity (e.g., supporting ICJ advisory requests or other UN instruments) without reflexive alignment that forecloses bilateral engagement;
  - contingency planning: prepare for operational disruptions to UN channels where India is a donor or actor — develop arrangements with NGOs, regional partners and international financial institutions to preserve humanitarian flows without contravening international law;
  - reputational management: use quiet diplomacy to reduce escalation, while signalling support for international law and civilian protection to uphold India’s image as a responsible global actor.
- Strategic autonomy and coalition building: India should assess how to balance strategic autonomy with coalition pressures (e.g., from Western donors or regional partners) when international legal-administrative disputes impact humanitarian operations in which India has an interest.

7. Conclusion — normative and practical takeaways
- The Israeli ban on UNRWA and the UNGA’s recourse to the ICJ encapsulate a core tension in contemporary international practice: domestic security and sovereignty claims versus the operational integrity of multilateral humanitarian governance.
- For policymakers and students of strategic culture, the episode reaffirms that legal instruments (even non‑binding advisory opinions) shape the political terrain and that disruptions to UN agencies carry immediate humanitarian costs and longer‑term strategic repercussions.
- For India — and similarly placed middle powers — the prudent posture combines defence of multilateral norms, flexible operational planning for humanitarian contingencies, and diplomatic engagement designed to minimise collateral humanitarian harm while protecting national strategic interests.
