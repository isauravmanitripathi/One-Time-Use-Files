### 6.x The Federation of Euro‑Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS): institutional profile and strategic relevance

Summary
- FEAS (commonly cited as the Federation of Euro‑Asian Stock Exchanges; occasional variant FEASE appears in sources) is a non‑profit international federation of capital‑market institutions.
- Established on 16 May 1995 in Istanbul, Turkey, with 12 founding members; the federation now counts c.30 members drawn from 29 countries.
- Membership comprises primary stock exchanges and related market institutions (post‑trade entities), dealers’ associations and regional federations.
- Geographic focus is Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia (broadly “Eurasia”), but membership is open internationally.
- Headquarters are in Yerevan, Armenia.
- Core purposes: promote cooperation, development, support and promotion of capital markets across the Eurasian space.

Origin and mandate: why FEAS was created
- FEAS emerged in the immediate post‑Cold War era when the dismantling of centrally planned systems and the opening of economies across Eastern Europe, Central Asia and parts of the Middle East created both opportunity and fragmentation in financial markets. The 1995 founding reflects an institutional response to the need for coordinated capacity building, knowledge transfer and standards harmonization among nascent and reforming securities markets.
- As a federation rather than a supranational regulator, FEAS is designed to be a platform for information exchange, technical cooperation, and voluntary alignment on best practices — priorities that mirror the transitional needs of member markets (market design, disclosure regimes, trading and clearing infrastructure).

Composition and internal architecture
- Members: the federation aggregates a mix of market operators — stock exchanges, post‑trade institutions (clearing and settlement bodies), dealers’ or brokers’ associations, and regional federations. This composition signals an emphasis not only on exchange governance but on the full market ecosystem (trade execution, clearing, settlement, and intermediary conduct).
- Geographic and numerical scope: from 12 founding exchanges in 1995 to roughly 30 members representing 29 countries, FEAS covers a wide Eurasian swath. The inclusion of dealers’ associations expands stakeholder representation beyond operators to market participants.
- Headquarters: locating the secretariat in Yerevan is significant politically and practically; it highlights Armenia’s ambition as a regional cooperation hub and provides FEAS with a base in a state positioned between larger regional actors.

Activities and functions (typical for federations of this type)
- Information exchange: comparative data on market structures, regulatory approaches and performance metrics.
- Capacity building and training: seminars, technical assistance, and exchange of expertise to develop human capital and institutional capability in emerging markets.
- Standards harmonization and regulatory dialogue: promoting best practices in disclosure, market surveillance, corporate governance and anti‑market abuse frameworks without imposing binding legal standards.
- Market infrastructure development: engaging post‑trade institutions on clearing and settlement reform, risk management and interoperability.
- Convening and visibility: conferences and working groups that facilitate cross‑listing discussions, investor outreach and shared market data initiatives.

Strategic and policy implications for national security and strategic culture (relevance to India)
- Economic security: robust and interoperable capital markets reduce systemic risk and promote resilience. For a strategic actor such as India, observing and engaging with federations like FEAS informs policy on regional financial stability and investment protection.
- Economic statecraft and influence: FEAS-type platforms are instruments of soft economic power. Membership or collaboration can facilitate investment ties, information flows and reputational linkage — tools India uses in its commercial diplomacy and regional hedging strategies.
- Cross‑border investment and contingency: FEAS activities that promote cross‑listing and improved post‑trade infrastructure can facilitate portfolio flows and FDI into member markets. For India, this matters both as a source of outbound investment and as a destination for Eurasian capital seeking diversification.
- Lessons for domestic reform: the emphasis on capacity building and standards harmonization within FEAS offers a template for Indian policymakers interested in strengthening market infrastructure in peripheral regions or in connecting Indian markets with neighboring capital markets.
- Strategic partnerships and regional connectivity: because FEAS membership is open internationally, Indian exchanges, post‑trade entities or dealers’ associations could engage with FEAS either formally or through bilateral cooperation. Such engagement would fit within India’s broader strategic culture that balances autonomy with selective institutional engagement to advance economic and security objectives.

Concluding assessment
- FEAS represents a pragmatic, membership‑driven response to the institutional needs of transitioning and emerging Eurasian capital markets. Its mix of exchanges and post‑trade institutions, combined with training and standard‑sharing roles, renders it an important regional actor in the architecture of financial governance.
- For Indian strategists and policy‑makers, FEAS is primarily relevant as a case study in regional financial cooperation and as a possible partner in economic diplomacy: its open membership provides avenues for engagement that align with India’s preference for flexible, interest‑driven institutional participation rather than entangling formal alliances.
- In the broader sweep of national security policy, organizations like FEAS remind us that financial infrastructure and market governance are integral to economic resilience and strategic influence — domains that now rank alongside military and diplomatic instruments in India’s strategic calculus.

### Full members of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS)

Context
- The Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) is a regional forum of institutional market participants — principally securities exchanges, central securities depositories and, occasionally, commodity exchanges — that fosters cooperation, information sharing and capacity-building across a wide swathe of Eurasia and neighbouring regions. The following is the list of FEAS “full members” as presented in the source text, followed by an analytical synthesis of what that membership composition signifies for stakeholders, and why it should be of interest to scholars and policymakers concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

List of full members (by country and institutions)
- Armenia — Armenia Securities Exchange; Central Depository of Armenia  
- Belarus — Belarusian Currency and Stock Exchange  
- Cyprus — Cyprus Stock Exchange  
- Egypt — Egyptian Exchange; Misr for Central Clearing, Depository and Registry  
- Greece — Athens Stock Exchange  
- Iran — Iran Fara Bourse; Tehran Stock Exchange  
- Iraq — Iraq Stock Exchange  
- Jordan — Amman Stock Exchange  
- Kazakhstan — Astana International Exchange; Kazakhstan Stock Exchange  
- North Macedonia — Macedonian Stock Exchange  
- Oman — Muscat Stock Exchange  
- Palestine — Palestine Exchange  
- Romania — Bucharest Stock Exchange  
- Syria — Damascus Securities Exchange  
- Uzbekistan — Tashkent Stock Exchange; Uzbek Commodity Exchange

Institutional composition and what it signals
- Types of members: The FEAS full-member roster includes primary securities exchanges (national trading venues), central securities depositories (post‑trade infrastructure), and at least one commodity exchange (Uzbek Commodity Exchange). The inclusion of depositories alongside exchanges highlights FEAS’s interest in market infrastructure and integrity, not only trading volumes.
- Dual entries: Several countries appear with multiple institutions (e.g., Egypt, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Armenia), reflecting both trading platforms and post‑trade entities or alternative/newer exchanges (for example, the Astana International Exchange as an international/alternative venue alongside the national Kazakhstan Stock Exchange).
- Market character: Most listed markets are best classified as emerging or frontier markets rather than developed-market centres. The list mixes well‑established European exchanges (Athens, Bucharest, Cyprus) with smaller or more recently developed platforms in Central Asia, the Caucasus and the Middle East.

Geographic span and regional significance
- FEAS coverage extends across Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, the Levant and parts of North Africa (Egypt), manifesting a truly Euro‑Asian footprint. This distribution situates FEAS as a forum for markets lying along important geo-economic corridors linking Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East.
- Absence of major Western European hubs: The conspicuous absence of major Western European markets (London, Paris, Frankfurt) is consistent with FEAS’s regional focus; the federation complements, rather than competes with, global financial centres.

Operational and political constraints
- Fragile contexts: Several member markets operate in politically unstable or sanction‑affected environments (e.g., Syria, Iran, Belarus, parts of Iraq and Palestine). These conditions materially affect liquidity, foreign access, counterparty risk and the ability to conduct cross-border transactions.
- Heterogeneous regulation and capacity: Member jurisdictions display wide variation in regulatory maturity, market transparency and settlement infrastructure. That heterogeneity is precisely the governance gap FEAS aims to address through cooperation and capacity-building.

Key observations (summary)
- Coverage: Fifteen countries are listed, accounting for 18+ institutional entries because of multiple bodies per country.
- Diversity: The roster mixes national, regional and alternative/newer exchanges, along with central depositories and a commodity exchange.
- Infrastructure focus: Explicit inclusion of depositories underscores FEAS’s orientation toward strengthening post‑trade systems, not merely trading venues.

Implications for stakeholders — with relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For investors and Indian institutional capital: FEAS membership signals potential cross‑border investment opportunities in under‑covered emerging and frontier markets. However, Indian investors must weigh frontier-market returns against elevated political and regulatory risk, sanctions exposure, currency convertibility issues, and limited liquidity. Due diligence on settlement finality and depository arrangements is especially important where central depositories are members.
- For regulators and policymakers (including Indian authorities): FEAS presents a platform model for regional standard‑setting on market infrastructure, supervision and anti‑money‑laundering practices. India’s regulators could learn from — or selectively cooperate with — FEAS mechanisms to better understand regional risk contagion, capital flow vulnerabilities and best practices for resilient post‑trade systems.
- For exchanges and market operators: Membership illustrates the value placed on technical assistance, training and harmonisation. Indian exchanges and depositories could seek observer roles or technical exchanges with FEAS members to expand their footprint, learn about frontier-market operations, or support connectivity initiatives that align with India’s economic statecraft.
- For researchers and security analysts: The FEAS membership list provides a mapping of institutional counterparts across a strategic arc from the Eastern Mediterranean to Central Asia. That map is useful for assessing how economic linkages (capital flows, market access) intersect with geopolitical vectors that matter to India — e.g., connectivity initiatives, energy corridors and diaspora finance channels.

Policy implications and brief recommendations for India
- Monitor and map risks: Incorporate FEAS-member markets into India’s economic security assessments where Indian capital, firms or citizens are exposed. Pay particular attention to settlement, sanctions-compliance risks and market access constraints.
- Selective engagement: Pursue selective technical cooperation (regulatory dialogue, depository best practices, cyber-resilience training) with FEAS members where it advances India’s economic diplomacy and helps stabilise neighbouring markets that affect Indian interests.
- Use market diplomacy as strategic tool: Market-level engagement (exchanges, depositories) can complement broader foreign-policy objectives — offering capacity building, technical assistance and investor education as elements of soft power and regional stability.
- Research and intelligence coordination: Encourage formal and informal researcher-practitioner exchanges to maintain up‑to‑date knowledge of frontier-market developments that could have knock‑on effects on trade, remittances or strategic supply chains.

Conclusion
The FEAS full-member roster is less a list of heavyweight global financial centres than a map of institutional actors across a geopolitically significant region of emerging and frontier markets. For scholars of strategic culture and for national security policymakers in India, the list matters because market institutions are conduits of economic influence, sources of vulnerability (capital flight, sanctions exposure), and venues for technical cooperation that can reinforce regional stability. A calibrated mixture of monitoring, selective engagement and technical cooperation with FEAS‑related institutions aligns with India’s broader objective of securing its economic perimeter while projecting constructive regional influence.

### 4.x Case study: The FEAS affiliate network — composition, function and policy relevance

This short case study draws on a snapshot list of affiliate members of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS). It illustrates how an international forum of exchanges supplements its core membership with a diverse set of partner organisations, and why that heterogeneity matters for a country’s strategic culture and national security policy — particularly where economic resilience, market infrastructure and cross‑border financial cooperation are concerned.

Summary of listed affiliates
- Canada — Blockstation: listed as a Canadian affiliate organisation, a firm associated with digital-asset/trading platform services.
- European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD): a multilateral development bank listed as an affiliate, indicating engagement by a development finance institution rather than a national exchange.
- Georgia — Devexperts: listed as a Georgian affiliate; a financial software and trading-technology provider.
- Iran — Central Securities Depository of Iran: a depository/clearing entity tasked with custody and post‑trade functions.
- Iran — Securities Exchange Brokers Association: representative body for brokers and trading intermediaries.
- Iran — Tehran Stock Exchange Tech Mgmt Co: an exchange technology/management company (entry accompanied by an archival note).
  - Note: the Iranian entries include “Archived 2019‑12‑16 at the Wayback Machine,” indicating the source was captured in 2019.
- Jordan — Securities Depository Center of Jordan: the national depository operator listed as an affiliate.
- Norway — Baymarkets: listed as a Norwegian affiliate, typically a market‑data/trading‑technology provider.
- Oman — Muscat Clearing & Depository: the national clearing and depository operator (with archival note).
  - Note: this Oman entry includes “Archived 2022‑05‑25 at the Wayback Machine.”
- United Kingdom — Percival: listed as a UK affiliate, likely a technology or consulting firm.

Understanding “affiliate” in the FEAS context
- Affiliates are partner organisations associated with FEAS’s network but are not necessarily full exchange members with governance or voting privileges.
- The affiliate label signals cooperation, information exchange, technical support or industry representation rather than formal rule‑making authority within the federation.
- Practically, affiliates provide specialised inputs (technology, market infrastructure, financing, or industry advocacy) that complement what national exchanges deliver.

Functional diversity and geographic spread
- Types of affiliates present in the list: technology vendors (Devexperts, Baymarkets, Percival), clearing and depository operators (Central Securities Depository of Iran; Muscat Clearing & Depository; Securities Depository Center of Jordan), broker associations, and a multilateral development bank (EBRD).
- Geographic coverage extends beyond the “Euro‑Asian” label to include North America (Canada) and a global institution (EBRD). This underlines FEAS’s practical outreach and the transnational nature of contemporary market infrastructure networks.
- The presence of multiple Iranian affiliates and archival notes highlights both the historical depth of relationships and the need to treat past listings as potentially time‑bound.

Verification and temporal caveats
- The archival notes (Wayback snapshots) in some entries indicate the list was compiled from web archives; affiliate rosters can change. Users should verify current affiliation status on FEAS’s official website or in the federation’s latest publications before relying on the list for operational or policy decisions.
- Distinguish between historical association and present‑day active partnership; archival evidence is valuable but signals potential discontinuity.

Policy implications for India’s strategic culture and national security
- Economic security and infrastructure resilience: Affiliates that provide clearing, depository and trading‑technology services are integral to market continuity. For India, understanding such networks is important when assessing resilience risks from foreign providers, dependency on external tech stacks, and the need for domestic alternatives or diversification.
- Strategic partnerships and multilateral finance: The inclusion of the EBRD as an affiliate demonstrates how development finance institutions intersect with exchange networks. India’s engagement with similar institutions or regional exchange bodies can be a lever for economic statecraft — promoting market development, cross‑border listings or cooperative regulatory dialogues.
- Technology sovereignty and supply‑chain risk: Technology vendors (trading platforms, market‑data providers) are private affiliates that can influence market functioning. India’s strategic calculus should weigh the benefits of advanced foreign systems against concerns about vendor lock‑in, data localisation, cybersecurity and regulatory oversight.
- Regulatory and governance distinctions: Affiliates support operations and policy work but lack the governance prerogatives of full members. For policy‑makers, this distinction affects how much influence an external actor can exert over rule‑setting versus operational collaboration.
- Regional diplomacy and information exchange: Engagement with umbrella organisations like FEAS and their affiliates can facilitate regulatory harmonisation, capacity building and crisis cooperation — valuable tools in a strategic culture that prizes adaptive, networked responses to economic shocks.

Concluding guidance
- Treat such affiliate lists as illustrative of functional diversity — technology, post‑trade infrastructure, broker representation and development finance — rather than exhaustive or permanently current rosters.
- For any policy, supervisory or procurement decision, cross‑check current FEAS materials and perform due diligence on affiliate capabilities, ownership, and continuity of association.

This case shows how a relatively compact roster of affiliates encapsulates broader themes — technological dependence, infrastructure security, multilateral engagement and the operational reach of international exchange networks — all of which feed into an informed, pragmatic approach to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### Observer members of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS)

FEAS maintains a category of “observer” membership that allows institutions outside full membership to participate in the federation’s activities without full voting rights. Observer status is primarily a mechanism for information exchange, technical cooperation, and networking; it is frequently used by organizations that wish to cultivate ties with regional market operators while not committing to the legal or governance obligations of full membership. The following concise account synthesizes FEAS’s publicly listed observers, highlights salient institutional types, and flags issues of verification and strategic relevance — particularly for readers interested in how transnational financial networks interact with national strategic cultures and security policy.

Key points about observer status and composition
- Observer status implies involvement in FEAS fora and technical working groups but typically excludes full governance or voting rights. The role is oriented to cooperation, learning, and visibility rather than formal decision-making.
- FEAS observers are diverse in form and function: traditional exchanges, a commodity/derivatives exchange, a central securities depository, a cross-regional exchange initiative, a private quantitative firm, and a project-based initiative. This heterogeneity shapes the substance of contributions (e.g., listing rules vs. post-trade operations vs. commodity-market technicalities).
- Geographically the observer set spans Europe, Central Asia, East Asia and Oceania — reflecting FEAS’s transregional remit and the political-economic interplay between Eurasian markets.
- Institutional anomalies merit attention: some entries appear to be sub‑national projects (Scotland — Project Blackthorn), private companies rather than exchanges (swissQuant), or entities whose names need verification (Asia–Europe Exchange). Such cases affect how one should interpret FEAS’s reach and membership criteria.
- For policymakers and analysts, observers are vectors for cross-border listings, technical cooperation, capacity building, and data/intelligence flows — all of which have implications for economic statecraft, regulatory coordination, and systemic risk monitoring.

Short institutional profiles (1–2 lines each)
- Australia — Sydney Stock Exchange: An Australian exchange focused on small- to mid-cap listings; observer status expands FEAS’s Australasian linkages.
- Bosnia and Herzegovina — Banja Luka Stock Exchange: A regional Bosnian exchange offering local equity and debt trading; contributes Balkan market perspective.
- China — Asia–Europe Exchange: A cross‑regional exchange initiative (requires verification of legal form); potentially aimed at linking European and Asian capital markets.
- Georgia — Georgian Stock Exchange: Georgia’s principal equities and securities market operator; provides insights into Caucasus market development.
- Iran — Iran Mercantile Exchange: A commodity and derivatives focused exchange; observer role likely centers on commodities market linkages and pricing mechanisms.
- Moldova — Moldova Stock Exchange: The principal Moldovan equities market operator; relevant for Eastern European integration discussions.
- North Macedonia — Central Securities Depository of Macedonia: A post‑trade infrastructure provider (depository rather than exchange); brings settlement and custody expertise.
- Scotland — Project Blackthorn: A Scotland‑based project or initiative (sub‑national actor) listed as an observer; underscores the presence of non‑sovereign participants and the need to check FEAS territorial representation rules.
- Serbia — Belgrade Stock Exchange: Serbia’s main securities exchange; provides Western Balkans market connectivity.
- Switzerland — swissQuant: Appears to be a private quantitative/financial firm rather than a traditional exchange; indicates FEAS openness to private-sector technical expertise (verification recommended).
- Tajikistan — Central Asian Stock Exchange: A regional Central Asian exchange entity; represents perspectives from Central Asian capital markets.

Practical implications and analytical observations
- Functional diversity matters: exchanges bring listing and market-structure perspectives; depositories contribute post‑trade and settlement expertise; commodity exchanges foreground price discovery in non‑financial assets; private firms may bring algorithmic trading, data analytics or risk‑management tools.
- For states, the presence of such observers affects strategic policy domains: cross-border capital flows, access to foreign listings, regulatory harmonization, sanctions compliance (notably where Iran-linked entities participate), and financial sector cyber‑resilience.
- Non‑state and sub‑national actors within FEAS (projects, private firms, regionally branded initiatives) complicate the conventional state‑centric map of international organizations, reflecting an increasingly polycentric financial governance ecosystem.
- Verification is essential: organizational names and statuses (e.g., “Asia–Europe Exchange”, “swissQuant”, “Project Blackthorn”) should be checked against current FEAS records to account for renamings, project discontinuations, or status changes.

Recommendations for analysts and policymakers (brief)
- Validate the observer roster against the latest FEAS official list and corroborate each entity’s institutional type and jurisdictional status.
- Where national security considerations intersect (e.g., participation of Iranian commodity exchange, or private firms with advanced quant capabilities), undertake targeted due diligence on data sharing, compliance regimes, and cyber‑operational risk.
- Treat FEAS observers as low‑cost channels for technical cooperation and capacity building, but not as substitutes for formal regulatory engagement or intelligence on capital flows.
- For Indian policymakers: monitor such trans‑regional networks for their potential to reshape regional capital markets, enable new investment routes into and out of South Asia, and introduce technical standards that could affect India’s own regulatory posture.

Concluding remark
The FEAS observer category illustrates how contemporary financial governance mixes state and non‑state actors, and how regional federations cultivate flexible memberships to encourage cooperation. For scholars of strategic culture and national security policy, the heterogeneous composition of observers underscores the need to track not only interstate institutions but also the myriad private and sub‑national participants that increasingly mediate economic interdependence and strategic exposure.

### Case study: Bourse Scot Limited — a defunct FEAS observer

Context
- The listing appears under "Former observer members" of the Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS).
- It identifies the jurisdiction as "Scotland" and the corporate name as Bourse Scot Limited.
- The entry is annotated with the parenthetical remark “(dissolved in 2019),” indicating the company ceased to exist in that year.

Core facts (explicit)
- Entity: Bourse Scot Limited.
- Jurisdiction/label used: Scotland (a sub‑national designation rather than “United Kingdom”).
- Status: Dissolved.
- Year of dissolution: 2019.
- Role in FEAS: Former observer member (not a full national exchange member).

Interpretation and analytical observations
- Observer status: Bourse Scot Limited was an observer in FEAS, which typically signals limited, non‑voting participation — common for private market initiatives or small regional exchanges that seek technical engagement without full membership.
- Sub‑national designation: FEAS’s identification of “Scotland” rather than “United Kingdom” indicates the organization permits subnational or corporate observer designations. This practice can reflect FEAS’s flexible approach to representation but also complicates the mapping between political sovereignty and institutional representation.
- Cessation of representation: As the firm was dissolved in 2019 it no longer represents any Scottish corporate or sub‑national interest within FEAS; absent a successor, there is no continuing Scottish corporate observer via that entity.

Implications (institutional and strategic)
- Record accuracy: FEAS’s roster should be amended to reflect that this entity is defunct. Maintaining accurate membership and observer records is essential for transparency, legal clarity and the credibility of an international association.
- Representation gap: If no successor observer has been appointed, there is a representational gap for Scottish corporate interests within FEAS. That gap may be symbolic more than substantive (most UK capital‑market engagement flows through London), but it can matter for regional initiatives and signalling.
- Regulatory and verification issues: A dissolved corporate observer underscores the need for organizations to periodically verify the legal status of non‑state participants, which has knock‑on effects for permissions, data‑sharing agreements and event participation.
- Broader strategic relevance: For states and policymakers (including India), accurate institutional rosters and clarity about which entities participate in international economic fora matter for economic diplomacy, risk assessment, and regulatory cooperation. Defunct observers can obscure networks of influence and complicate outreach or treaty implementation.

Additional relevant points and context
- Verification route: The UK Companies House register is the authoritative public source to confirm the dissolution date, manner of striking‑off (voluntary strike‑off vs. compulsory strike‑off), or liquidation.
- FEAS practice: FEAS normally includes national and regional exchanges as full members; observer slots often accommodate private initiatives or smaller market platforms seeking technical engagement.
- UK constitutional note: Scotland is a constituent nation of the United Kingdom; primary UK exchange functions are concentrated in London. FEAS’s recording of “Scotland” highlights how international organizations sometimes accommodate subnational or corporate identities for practical or political reasons.
- Non‑implication for national membership: The dissolution of a corporate observer does not affect any country’s full membership status in FEAS; it only removes a particular observer presence.

Recommended actions (archival, verification, and policy)
- Verify dissolution: Consult the Companies House record for Bourse Scot Limited to confirm the date, method and any filings related to the dissolution (e.g., voluntary strike‑off, administration, creditors’ voluntary liquidation).
- Update FEAS records: Amend the FEAS member/observer list and related public materials to mark Bourse Scot Limited as dissolved and a former observer; where appropriate, link to a brief archival note explaining the circumstances.
- Seek successors: Investigate whether any successor Scottish market initiative or corporate entity has been formed or sought observer status in FEAS; if not, determine whether Scottish (or UK) market interests wish to re‑establish representation.
- Archive explanatory material: For historical accuracy and institutional memory, preserve records of any correspondence, press releases or FEAS minutes that explain the entity’s admission and later dissolution.
- Routine verification protocol: Consider recommending that FEAS and similar organizations institute a periodic verification protocol for non‑state participants to avoid stale or inaccurate registries.

Primary sources to consult
- UK Companies House entry for Bourse Scot Limited (to confirm dissolution details).
- FEAS official membership and observers list, and any archival minutes or press releases relating to Bourse Scot Limited’s admission and removal.
- Contemporary news coverage or industry press (2018–2020) that may report on the company’s activities, ambitions, or reasons for dissolution.

Brief interpretive note for readers concerned with national security and strategic culture
- This small institutional vignette illustrates a broader point relevant to strategic culture and national security: the integrity of international institutional registries matters. Whether for economic diplomacy, sanctions screening, or regulatory cooperation, knowing which actors legitimately represent regional or national markets affects how states (including India) assess external economic networks and craft policy responses. Regular verification and transparent archival practice are therefore modest but important elements of resilient national economic‑security posture.

### The Federation of Euro‑Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS): Partnerships, Purpose and Strategic Relevance

Overview
- The Federation of Euro‑Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) sustains formal partnership agreements with a range of regional and thematic market organisations. These relationships are not merely symbolic: they constitute an infrastructure of cooperation through which member exchanges can access technical assistance, harmonised standards, and platforms for regulatory dialogue.
- For readers concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, FEAS–style networks illustrate how financial governance and multilateral market cooperation contribute to economic resilience, normative alignment, and strategic influence in the transregional arena.

Core purposes of FEAS partnerships
- Market development: sharing technical expertise to deepen and broaden capital markets (e.g., product development, market microstructure improvements).
- Technical assistance and capacity building: training personnel, building supervisory and operational competence, and transferring best practice.
- Information exchange and regulatory dialogue: enabling supervisory authorities and exchanges to compare approaches to market integrity, surveillance and risk management.
- Standards harmonisation: promoting common regimes for securities identifiers, reporting formats and trading/clearing standards that reduce friction in cross‑border investment.
- Thematic cooperation: addressing emergent policy agendas (derivatives markets, ESG disclosure, cross‑listing facilitation).

Key partner organisations and their functional significance
- African Securities Exchanges Association (ASEA)
  - Role: a regional association convening African exchanges to promote market development and integration.
  - Partnership implication: channels for knowledge transfer on listing rules, cross‑listing mechanics and market infrastructure upgrades; potential facilitation of North–South capital flows.
  - Strategic relevance: supports liquidity creation and diversification opportunities for FEAS members, with spillovers for geopolitical economic ties between Eurasia and Africa.

- Arab Federation of Capital Markets
  - Role: a coordination body for Arab capital market authorities and exchanges.
  - Partnership implication: regulatory dialogue and information sharing to align market practices across the Arab region.
  - Strategic relevance: fosters regional policy coherence that can reduce regulatory arbitrage and support stable cross‑regional investment corridors.

- Association of Futures Markets
  - Role: representative of futures/derivatives exchanges and stakeholders.
  - Partnership implication: collaboration on derivatives market development, risk management frameworks, clearing and settlement best practice.
  - Strategic relevance: derivatives deepen risk management capabilities of markets but also raise systemic‑risk concerns; cooperative engagement helps mitigate those risks through shared standards.

- Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA)
  - Role: custodian of the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) regime and related securities identification standards.
  - Partnership implication: emphasis on harmonised identifiers and market data standards to facilitate cross‑border trading, settlement and data aggregation.
  - Strategic relevance: standardized identifiers reduce frictions in cross‑border investment and enhance transparency—critical for surveillance and crisis management.

- Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSE)
  - Role: a UN/UNCTAD‑backed platform promoting sustainability reporting and ESG integration in capital markets.
  - Partnership implication: engagement with sustainable finance, ESG disclosure, stewardship and investor engagement practices.
  - Strategic relevance: aligns market participants with global sustainability norms, with implications for national policy objectives (climate risk management, sovereign credit perceptions, and investor confidence).

Strategic implications for FEAS members (and for India)
- FEAS positions itself as a connector across regions (Euro‑Asia, Africa, Arab world) and themes (derivatives, data standards, ESG), thereby expanding the geopolitical reach of its members’ capital markets.
- For India, engagement with FEAS partnerships (directly or via Indian exchanges’ collaboration) can:
  - Enhance market infrastructure and interoperability, facilitating Indian capital market access to regional investors.
  - Strengthen systemic resilience through adoption of harmonised standards (e.g., ISIN) and improved risk‑management practices.
  - Serve as a form of economic statecraft: influencing normative frameworks (ESG, market governance) that affect the operating environment for Indian firms abroad.
  - Create channels for policy learning on derivatives oversight and sustainability disclosure that inform domestic regulatory reform.

Member benefits and institutional outputs
- Tangible member benefits:
  - Improved market infrastructure and operational know‑how.
  - Greater standardisation (notably ISIN adoption) enabling smoother cross‑border transactions.
  - Access to focused training, technical assistance and peer review.
  - Potential expansion of liquidity via cross‑listing and harmonised practices that increase investor confidence.
- Typical operational outputs expected from partnerships:
  - Joint conferences, seminars and capacity‑building workshops.
  - Research, guidance papers and comparative studies on market practices.
  - Pilot projects (e.g., cross‑listing pilots, harmonised ESG disclosure templates, test beds for derivatives products).
  - Memoranda of understanding (MoUs) that can range from symbolic cooperation to detailed programmatic commitments.

What to watch — assessing depth and strategic value
- Formality versus activity: distinguish signed memoranda from active programs. A partnership’s strategic value depends on implementation: shared events are useful, but sustained technical cooperation and pilots matter more.
- Measurable outcomes: track concrete metrics such as number of trainings delivered, standards adopted (e.g., ISIN coverage), cross‑listings completed, and uptake of ESG reporting frameworks.
- Risk management outcomes: evaluate whether derivatives cooperation strengthens clearing/collateral arrangements and reduces contagion risk, or whether it inadvertently increases systemic interconnectedness without adequate safeguards.
- Strategic spillovers: monitor whether cooperation reshapes regional investment patterns, norm diffusion (e.g., ESG practices) or political‑economic alignments that affect national security considerations.

Concluding assessment — why this matters for national security policy
- Financial governance and multilateral market cooperation have direct implications for national resilience, economic statecraft and exposure to cross‑border shocks. FEAS’s networked partnerships illustrate how exchanges and market associations operate as vectors of technical assistance, norm diffusion and practical integration.
- For India’s strategic culture, these partnerships underscore a dual imperative: to engage internationally to shape favourable market norms and to build domestic capacity so that international cooperation enhances—rather than compromises—financial stability and policy autonomy.
