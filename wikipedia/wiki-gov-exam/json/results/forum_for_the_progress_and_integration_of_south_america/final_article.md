## PROSUR: A Case Study in Ideological Regionalism and Institutional Volatility

### Overview and nomenclature
- Formal English name: Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America (PROSUR).
- Spanish name/acronym: Foro para el Progreso e Integración de América del Sur (PROSUR).
- Portuguese rendition/acronym used in some sources: Fórum para o Progresso e Desenvolvimento da América do Sul (PROSUL).
- A Dutch-language version (occasionally seen in multilingual listings): Forum voor de Vooruitgang en Integratie van Zuid-Amerika (FVIZA).
- Typology: an intergovernmental regional organization launched as a mechanism for South American policy coordination.

Note on source reliability: the public, encyclopedic summary of PROSUR often carries a notice that the article “needs additional citations for verification.” Key factual claims, quotations and characterizations in secondary summaries therefore require confirmation from primary documents (official communiqués, presidential speeches) and reputable news or academic analyses.

(Technical/visual note encountered in reference material: listings sometimes include a clickable Euler diagram of multinational organizations in the Americas, indicating relationships among overlapping regional bodies. Such visual navigation aids are useful but ancillary to institutional analysis.)

### Origins, stated purpose and founding intent
- Initiators: The initiative was publicly launched by Chilean President Sebastián Piñera and Colombian President Iván Duque in January–February 2019.
- Stated objective: to create an integration body to supplant the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR). PROSUR’s declared purpose emphasized a coordination mechanism for public policies across South America, with a defensive posture in favour of democracy and the rule of law.
- Public formulations of intent (as announced by founding leaders):
  - Colombian president (announced 14 January 2019): PROSUR was described as a South American coordination mechanism for public policies, defending “democracy, independence of powers, market economy, social agenda, sustainability, and proper application.”
  - Chilean president (18 February 2019): the forum would be open to South American countries that meet two requirements — the “full validity of the rule of law and full respect for freedoms and human rights.”

### Political characterization and ideological framing
- PROSUR has commonly been characterised in scholarly and policy commentary as a right‑of‑centre (or right‑wing) organisational response to the prior left‑leaning orientation of UNASUR. This characterization reflects:
  - the ideological positions of the founders (both center‑right/right‑leaning at the time),
  - the manifesto‑style emphases on market‑oriented policies, democratic norms as defined by the founders, and governance criteria that exclude certain governments de facto.
- The membership criteria emphasizing rule of law and human rights—while normative in rhetoric—can be applied selectively and instrumentally in geopolitical competition; institutional entry rules often reflect the policy preferences of founders.

### Chronology and membership dynamics
- Founding announcement: January–February 2019 (public statements by Piñera and Duque).
- Subsequent shifts illustrate institutional fragility tied to domestic political changes:
  - On 3 April 2022 Chile suspended its participation in PROSUR under the new president Gabriel Boric. This suspension demonstrates how rapid domestic political turnovers can alter participation and legitimacy of regional formations.
  - Suriname joined PROSUR in 2022, showing that membership is not strictly limited to the founding cluster and that the organisation can expand beyond its original core.

### Institutional implications and comparative context with UNASUR
- UNASUR context: UNASUR was the previous continent‑wide integration project with strong participation from left‑leaning governments in the 2000s and early 2010s. Its institutional breakdown and political contestation created a perceived space for an alternative mechanism.
- Comparative points of analysis (recommended for deeper study):
  - Institutional design: PROSUR intentionally adopted a lighter, more flexible structure compared with some multilateral bureaucratic models; contrasting its rules and secretariat arrangements with UNASUR reveals choices about formality, longevity and capacity.
  - Membership rules and enforcement: PROSUR’s explicit emphasis on rule‑of‑law and human rights as admission criteria contrasts with UNASUR’s rhetoric of non‑interference and broader inclusivity—this is a critical axis by which the two are often differentiated.
  - Effectiveness and resilience: Assessing whether PROSUR can deliver public‑policy coordination and regional problem‑solving requires tracking not only declarations but mechanisms for dispute resolution, financing, meeting frequency, and secretariat capacity—areas where new organisations commonly struggle.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Lessons in regional diplomacy and institutional choice:
  - Ideological regionalism: PROSUR exemplifies how regional organisations can be created as ideological alignments as much as functional instruments. For Indian policymakers, this underscores the need to distinguish between normative affinity and strategic interest when engaging regional blocs.
  - Institutional volatility: The rapid changes in participation (e.g., Chile’s suspension) highlight risks of aligning long‑term strategic initiatives to organisations whose membership is contingent on incumbent governments. India’s engagement strategy should therefore balance immediate political affinities with institutional durability.
  - Selectivity and norms: The selective application of normative entry criteria (rule of law, human rights) in regional bodies shows how normative commitments can be weaponized in interstate politics. India, when advancing normative agendas, needs to calibrate moral language with pragmatic diplomacy to preserve strategic options.
  - Comparative institutional design: Understanding why UNASUR faltered and why PROSUR was designed differently provides insight into how institutional features (formal bureaucracy vs. lightweight coordination) affect strategic partnerships and the ability to translate declarations into policy outcomes.

### Source caution and suggested verification strategy
- Because many online summaries flag unsourced claims, verify the following with primary and reputable secondary materials:
  - Founding dates and official communiqués from Chilean and Colombian presidential offices (January–February 2019).
  - Exact presidential quotations and their contexts (press releases, transcripts of speeches).
  - Official membership lists, accession documents (Suriname’s accession) and Chile’s suspension statement (3 April 2022).
- Recommended source types:
  - Official presidencies’ websites and joint communiqués.
  - Ministries of foreign affairs statements of member states.
  - Major regional newspapers and wire services (e.g., Agencia EFE, Reuters, BBC, regional outlets) for contemporaneous reporting.
  - Scholarly analyses and policy papers comparing PROSUR and UNASUR (international relations journals, think‑tank briefs).

Suggested next steps for the reader: consult comparative studies on UNASUR vs PROSUR institutional design and a catalog of primary documents (founding communiqués and accession/suspension statements) to ground any further analysis of regional dynamics in verified sources.

## PROSUR — Summits

This section summarizes and analyses the formal summits and extraordinary meetings of the Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America (PROSUR). It focuses on summit chronology, participation patterns, rules of inter-presidential rotation, and the diplomatic signals embedded in invitations and absences. For readers interested in comparative lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the short analytical notes at the end draw out relevant implications.

### Inaugural summit: Santiago, 22 March 2019
- The first formal meeting, styled the “Meeting of Presidents of South America,” took place in Santiago, Chile on 22 March 2019 under host Sebastián Piñera.
- Eight South American states signed the Declaration of Santiago for the renewal and strengthening of South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay and Peru. That declaration constituted the founding political act that initiated the process of creating PROSUR as a new regional forum aimed at renewing integration in the region.
- Three states abstained from signing the declaration: Bolivia, Suriname and Uruguay. Venezuelan representatives were not invited to the inaugural summit — a deliberate exclusion that signalled a clear political and normative orientation by the founding participants.
- Contextual note: PROSUR was presented publicly as an alternative to earlier integration efforts (notably UNASUR). The pattern of signatories and abstainers immediately exposed the forum’s political contours: alignment among governments skeptical of the previous UNASUR architecture and critical of the Maduro government in Venezuela.

### Second summit: virtual session, 12 December 2020
- Owing to the COVID‑19 pandemic, the second formal PROSUR summit was held as a videoconference on 12 December 2020. The pandemic thus materially affected both the format and tempo of regional diplomacy.
- Attendance and representation: heads of state participated from Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay and Peru. Guyana’s Prime Minister Mark Phillips and Uruguay’s President Luis Lacalle Pou were invited as special guests.
- Institutional procedure: during the 2020 summit the pro tempore presidency of PROSUR transferred from Chile (Sebastián Piñera) to Colombia (Iván Duque). The transfer was formalized by a presidential declaration adopted at the meeting; the declaration also emphasised cooperation on pandemic-related matters and signalled an operationalisation of the presidency-rotation rule.
- The virtual summit and the presidential declaration illustrate two operational characteristics of PROSUR in its early phase: (1) an effort to codify temporary leadership through inter-presidential declarations; and (2) an enhanced reliance on extraordinary, technology-enabled meetings to coordinate policy during crisis.

### Third summit: Cartagena de Indias, 26–27 January 2022
- The third formal PROSUR summit took place in Cartagena, Colombia on 26–27 January 2022. The Pacific Alliance summit was held concurrently at the same venue and on the same dates, indicating coordination (or at least co-location) with another regional bloc.
- Attendance and levels of representation:
  - Present in person were five heads of state: Colombia (host, Iván Duque), Paraguay (Mario Abdo Benítez), Ecuador (Guillermo Lasso), Guyana (Prime Minister Mark Phillips), and Chile (Sebastián Piñera).
  - Brazil was represented by Vice‑President Hamilton Mourão; Peru was represented by Foreign Minister Óscar Maúrtua — both substitutions signalling a lower level of executive engagement than a head‑of‑state presence.
  - Argentina sent no delegation. Chile’s President‑elect Gabriel Boric declined outgoing President Piñera’s invitation to attend the Colombia summits, a politically consequential refusal.
- Leadership rotation: Mario Abdo Benítez succeeded Iván Duque as pro tempore president of PROSUR during the 2022 summit. Abdo Benítez attended virtually after testing positive for COVID‑19, again illustrating the pandemic’s continuing operational impact.
- The Cartagena summit’s mixed patterns of attendance and representation — full presidential attendance by some, substituted representation by others, and notable absences — reveal both the limits to PROSUR’s consolidation and the importance of partisan/ideological alignment in determining participation.

### Formal summits (concise table)
| Summit | Date | Place/Format | Pro tempore host |
|---|---:|---|---|
| 1st | 22 Mar 2019 | Santiago, Chile | Sebastián Piñera (Chile) |
| 2nd | 12 Dec 2020 | Videoconference | Sebastián Piñera (Chile) → transfer to Iván Duque (Colombia) |
| 3rd | 27 Jan 2022 | Cartagena de Indias, Colombia | Iván Duque Márquez (Colombia) → Mario Abdo Benítez (Paraguay) |

### Extraordinary PROSUR meetings (videoconferences)
- A cluster of extraordinary videoconference meetings took place in response to the pandemic and other urgent matters:
  - Hosted by Chile (Sebastián Piñera): 16 March 2020; 6 April 2020; 19 May 2020; 27 August 2020.
  - Hosted by Colombia (Iván Duque Márquez): 25 February 2021; 16 March 2021.
- These meetings show that PROSUR, though nascent, engaged in frequent high-level crisis coordination during 2020–21.

### Analysis: political signals, institutional practice and operational dynamics
- Political orientation and signalling: Invitation lists, abstentions and explicit exclusions (notably Venezuela’s absence and the abstentions by Bolivia, Suriname and Uruguay) functioned as immediate diplomatic signals about PROSUR’s ideological leaning and normative benchmarks for democratic legitimacy. Membership/attendance thus carried reputational — not only programmatic — weight.
- Institutional mechanics: PROSUR operates with a rotating pro tempore presidency that is formalised through presidential declarations adopted at summits. This informal—but public—mode of leadership transfer underscores a personalized, executive-centred institutional culture.
- Levels of representation as a measure of engagement: Variation in who represents a state (head of state, vice‑president, foreign minister, or no delegation) provides a practical indicator of commitment. The pattern at Cartagena (vice‑presidential and ministerial representation for Brazil and Peru; Argentina’s absence) reflected diplomatic ambivalence and domestic political calculations.
- Pandemic effects and virtual diplomacy: COVID‑19 shaped both the frequency and format of meetings, creating a record of extraordinary videoconferences and occasional virtual attendance by pro tempore leaders. Virtual diplomacy became an operational necessity and a variable in who could participate.

### Comparative implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Regional forums as instruments of signalling: PROSUR illustrates how states use new regional architectures to signal alignment, normative stance and strategic intent. For India, constructing or engaging with regional institutions requires an appreciation that invitation and participation are political signals that can have reputational and diplomatic consequences beyond the functional agenda.
- Leadership norms and institutional design: PROSUR’s reliance on pro tempore presidential leadership formalised by declaration demonstrates a low‑bureaucracy, leader‑centric institutional model. India’s engagements with regional organisations (e.g., BIMSTEC, SCO) should account for how leadership rules shape agenda‑setting, continuity and bureaucratic institutionalisation.
- Crisis-driven diplomacy and virtual engagement: The pandemic-era acceleration of extraordinary meetings underlines the value of flexible, technology-enabled coordination mechanisms in times of crisis. India’s national security apparatus and diplomatic practice can benefit from institutionalised protocols for rapid, high‑level virtual coordination with regional partners.
- Exclusion and normative consistency: The diplomatic choice to exclude or not invite particular governments (as with Venezuela and PROSUR) highlights how normative judgments about governance and legitimacy can recalibrate regional alignments. India faces trade‑offs when balancing strategic partnerships, normative positions, and aspirations for convening broad-based regional cooperation.

Concluding remark
PROSUR’s summit record (2019–2022) captures a formative attempt to reshape South American regional governance along lines that combine executive leadership, normative signalling and pragmatic crisis coordination. For students of strategic culture, the forum offers a compact case of how new regional architectures are created, how participation becomes a vehicle for political signaling, and how operational modalities (rotation, virtual meetings, multi‑forum co‑location) influence the durability and reach of such organisations.

## The presidency pro tempore of PROSUR: tenure, rotation and an evidentiary note

PROSUR (Forum for the Progress and Integration of South America) was created in 2019 as a regional intergovernmental forum. Its pro tempore presidency—held by a sitting head of state of a member country—serves both a procedural and symbolic function: it convenes meetings, helps set short‑term agendas and confers diplomatic visibility on the holder. Formal practice is that the presidency is held for approximately one year and rotates among member states, but practice has shown important deviations from the ideal of strict one‑year rotation.

Observed record (2019–present)
- The first pro tempore president listed is Sebastián Piñera of Chile, beginning 22 March 2019.
- The sequence of holders in available records is shown below.

| No. | President pro tempore | Country | Beginning of mandate | End of mandate | Incumbent |
|-----|-----------------------|---------|----------------------:|----------------:|:---------:|
| 1 | Sebastián Piñera | Chile | 22 March 2019 | 12 December 2020 | No |
| 2 | Iván Duque | Colombia | 12 December 2020 | 27 January 2022 | No |
| 3 | Mario Abdo Benítez | Paraguay | 27 January 2022 | 15 August 2023 | No |
| 4 | Santiago Peña | Paraguay | 15 August 2023 | Incumbent | Yes |

Key inconsistencies and explanatory notes
- A textual claim recorded as “Since January 2022, the current president pro tempore of PROSUR is Paraguayan President Santiago Peña” is inconsistent with the dated record above: Santiago Peña’s mandate begins on 15 August 2023, while from 27 January 2022 until 15 August 2023 the post is recorded as held by Mario Abdo Benítez.
- The asserted one‑year term length is not strictly reflected in the date spans. Several mandates are shorter or longer than ~12 months. Causes for this divergence include:
  - Scheduling of PROSUR summit meetings and official hand‑overs (the forum meets irregularly; transfer dates often coincide with meetings or communiqués).
  - Domestic presidential transitions: when the holder of the pro tempore presidency leaves office at home, the presidency may pass to the incoming head of state from the same country (as happened in Paraguay), producing successive holders from the same country rather than an immediate rotation to a different state.
  - Ad hoc political decisions or delays in convening ministers/heads of state.
- The table’s empty “Portrait” column should be addressed in any public presentation (either populate with images sourced permissibly or remove the column).

Analytical implications (for scholars and external interlocutors)
- Rotational pro tempore leadership is intended to distribute agenda‑setting authority and visibility among members. Irregular handovers and intra‑country succession (two consecutive Paraguayan presidents holding the post because of a national leadership change) fragment predictability and continuity.
- For external actors—states or analysts seeking engagement with PROSUR—these irregularities matter: they affect timing for initiatives, the locus of contact for substantive dossiers, and the reliability of commitments made during a country’s nominal “year” in office.
- From the perspective of strategic cultures (for example, India's strategic planners considering engagement with Latin American multilateral forums), such governance irregularities underscore the need to verify current holders and meeting schedules from primary sources before calibrating diplomatic outreach.

Recommended corrections and next steps
- Correct the opening sentence to reflect the accurate timeline. For example: “Santiago Peña became president pro tempore of PROSUR on 15 August 2023.”
- Verify dates, term rules and any exceptional transfers against primary documents—official PROSUR communiqués, summit declarations, and host‑country records—before publishing or using the table for policy analysis.
- In public or printed materials, either supply portraits with proper rights clearance or remove the empty “Portrait” column to avoid the appearance of incomplete data.
- Where possible, annotate future tables with brief explanatory footnotes on transfers that coincide with domestic leadership changes or extraordinary summit scheduling.

Conclusion
The pro tempore presidency of PROSUR exemplifies how formal rules (annual rotation) interact with irregular political practice (summit timing and national transitions). For rigorous analysis and for external policy engagement, reliance on a single secondary summary is insufficient: scholars and policymakers should confirm the current holder and hand‑over logic from PROSUR’s original communiqués to avoid misstatements and to anticipate the forum’s agenda‑setting rhythms.
