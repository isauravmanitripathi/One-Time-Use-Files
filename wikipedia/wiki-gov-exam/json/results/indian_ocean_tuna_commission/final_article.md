### Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC): mandate, history and relevance to Indian strategic posture

The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC; French: Commission des thonidés de l’océan Indien, CTOI) is the primary intergovernmental body responsible for the coordinated conservation and management of tuna and tuna‑like species in the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas. As a de facto regional fisheries management organization (RFMO), the IOTC sits at the intersection of natural‑resource governance, maritime law and regional security — all dimensions important to India’s maritime strategy and national security policy.

History and legal basis
- The IOTC was conceived in 1993 and established by a multilateral treaty titled the Agreement for the Establishment of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission. The Agreement was approved by the FAO Council in November 1993 and entered into force on 27 March 1996 after acceptance by the tenth party.
- The Commission is the institutional successor to the Indo‑Pacific Tuna Development and Management Programme, which was established in 1982; this institutional continuity reflects a long‑standing regional effort to manage tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean basin.
- Headquarters: Victoria, Seychelles — a location that reflects geographical centrality to the region’s major tuna fisheries.

Membership and eligibility
- Membership is open to states with coasts in the Indian Ocean region (or adjacent seas) and to states that fish for tuna in the region; regional economic organizations may also accede. This ruleset creates a membership mix of coastal states and distant‑water fishing states, with attendant political dynamics.
- Reported membership (as of July 2024): 29 contracting parties. Members combine coastal Indian Ocean states, distant‑water fishing states and one regional organization (the European Union).
- Cooperating non‑contracting parties may participate with more limited rights and obligations; Liberia, for example, is listed as a cooperating non‑contracting party. Historical changes in membership illustrate fluidity: Vanuatu was a member between 2012 and 2015, while Eritrea remained a member until its withdrawal in 2023.

Functions, organisation and decision‑making
- Core functions mirror those of other RFMOs: conduct stock assessments, adopt conservation and management measures (e.g., catch limits or gear restrictions), establish monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) requirements, and oversee compliance and data reporting.
- The Commission typically operates through plenary meetings of contracting parties and through subsidiary bodies — notably scientific and technical committees that provide the evidence base for management measures.
- Cooperating non‑contracting parties have limited participation rights and responsibilities compared to full members, a mechanism designed to encourage compliance by non‑parties while preserving member control.

Challenges and political dynamics
- Enforcement and the suppression of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing are persistent challenges for the IOTC. Geographic scale, limited enforcement capacity among some coastal states, and the presence of distant‑water fleets complicate compliance and monitoring.
- The mix of coastal states and powerful distant‑water fishing nations (and the EU as a regional actor) shapes negotiation dynamics: coastal states emphasise resource access and rebuilding of local stocks, while distant‑water actors often prioritise continued fishing opportunities and fleet interests. These differing priorities affect the stringency and effectiveness of measures the Commission can adopt.
- Institutional limitations — for example, the IOTC’s dependence on state cooperation for surveillance and enforcement and the uneven capacity of members to implement rules — can blunt the Commission’s impact on stock recovery and sustainable exploitation.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security
- India is a contracting party to the IOTC. Tuna and tuna‑like species are both economic resources and elements of maritime resource competition; their governance therefore bears on India’s economic security and on broader maritime governance objectives.
- Participation in the IOTC aligns with India’s wider interests in multilateral regional institutions that regulate commons and contribute to maritime domain awareness, fisheries protection, and the suppression of maritime crime (including IUU fishing). Effective RFMO governance can reduce one vector of maritime tension and illicit activity in the Indian Ocean — a strategic priority for India’s coastal security and blue‑economy ambitions.
- In negotiations within IOTC, India navigates the same coastal vs distant‑water tension that characterises the Commission. How India balances development of its domestic fishing sector, pursues sustainable harvests, and engages in regional enforcement cooperation is informative about its broader approach to cooperative maritime governance.

Caveat on sources and verification
- The descriptive material above synthesises institutional facts and common analyses of IOTC practice. Some specific statements (historic membership changes, exact membership count and dates) have been flagged in source material as lacking inline citations (tag dated January 2024). Users of this analysis should verify specific facts and dates against primary sources (the IOTC Agreement text, IOTC Secretariat publications and official membership records) when precision and citation are required for academic or policy work.

(For a focused study in a book on India’s strategic culture, the IOTC offers a concise case: multilateral resource governance that tests India’s capacity for cooperative maritime management, enforcement diplomacy, and the reconciliation of national economic interests with regional conservation imperatives.)

## FAO legal opinion on the Chagos Archipelago and coastal‑state status: legal findings and regional implications

Background and core finding
- In May 2022 the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a legal opinion addressing the maritime and fisheries consequences of the disputed status of the Chagos Archipelago.  
- The FAO’s core finding was stark: the United Kingdom should no longer be recognized as a “coastal state” in relation to the waters of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean.  
- That assessment rests explicitly on the contested sovereignty of the Chagos islands and on United Nations General Assembly resolution 73/295, which affirms that the Chagos Archipelago forms part of the territory of Mauritius.

Legal rationale and immediate functional conclusion
- By severing the chain of legal authority that would underpin UK coastal‑state rights in the Chagos area, the FAO framed the United Kingdom’s role, for the purposes of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) framework, as that of a state that may engage in fishing activity in the region but does not possess the zone‑based coastal‑state rights and obligations (e.g., EEZ management prerogatives) customarily recognized under regional fisheries governance.  
- Functionally, this means UK fishing and other marine activity in Chagos‑related waters were characterized as not carrying with them the privileges (such as exclusive zone control for fisheries) nor the attendant management responsibilities (licensing regimes, enforcement duties tied to EEZ jurisdiction) that attach to recognized coastal‑state status in the IOTC context.

Legal context: coastal‑state rights under UNCLOS
- The delineation of coastal‑state rights in ocean zones derives principally from the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS): a coastal state exercises sovereignty in its territorial sea and sovereign rights in an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) out to 200 nautical miles, including primary responsibility for the living resources of the water column and seabed within that zone.  
- Those rights and duties are the legal basis for zone‑based fisheries measures, licensing schemes, quota allocations, and enforcement authority that regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) typically operationalize.

IOTC relevance and practical effects
- The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), as the RFMO responsible for highly migratory tuna and tuna‑like species in the region, organizes management measures and compliance mechanisms in a framework that depends heavily on coastal‑state authority and jurisdictional claims. Many IOTC measures presuppose clear coastal‑state arrangements: vessel authorization, zone‑specific conservation measures, catch reporting tied to EEZs, and enforcement cooperation.  
- If the UK is characterized as lacking coastal‑state status for Chagos waters, the immediate practical implications include altered presumptions about:
  - licensing and access — whether UK vessels require consent or must seek access via Mauritius rather than the UK;
  - enforcement jurisdiction — who may board, inspect, detain vessels or otherwise exercise regulatory control in the relevant maritime zones;
  - data and reporting obligations — whether biological and catch data from Chagos waters should be reported through Mauritius’ national submissions to the IOTC; and
  - the negotiation of access arrangements and zone‑based conservation measures, which may shift political and administrative negotiation to Mauritius.

Nature and legal effect of FAO opinions and the UNGA resolution
- It is important to qualify the legal status of the instruments that underpin this conclusion. FAO legal opinions are advisory: they carry significant technical and normative weight in international governance, and they are influential in practice for specialized bodies (such as RFMOs), but they are not judicial decisions with binding force in the manner of a court judgment.  
- UN General Assembly resolution 73/295 — which affirms that the Chagos Archipelago forms part of Mauritius and calls for the UK to withdraw — is politically and diplomatically consequential. UNGA resolutions do not constitute judicial determinations; nonetheless, they crystallize broad international political support for a particular sovereignty claim and can affect how international organizations and states treat competing claims in practice.

The United Kingdom’s position and complicating facts
- The UK continues to administer the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) and maintains a significant military presence on Diego Garcia. These facts complicate the operational and political dynamics of fisheries and sovereignty in the area: military basing, long‑term administrative control and defence relationships affect access patterns, enforcement capacity, and the political costs of any change to status quo practices.  
- The FAO opinion thus collides with an entrenched on‑the‑ground reality: UK administration and use of Diego Garcia for defence purposes; Mauritius’ claim and increasing international backing; and regional states’ varying comfort in disciplining operations around the archipelago.

Dispute pathways and institutional responses
- The legal and political dispute is susceptible to several pathways: bilateral diplomacy between the UK and Mauritius; recourse to judicial or quasi‑judicial fora (e.g., an application to the International Court of Justice for an advisory or contentious judgment, or to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea for maritime delimitation/adjudication matters); and practical administrative measures within RFMOs (where member states can alter recognition practices, vessel authorizations, and reporting lines).  
- Each pathway has different costs, timelines, and potential outcomes. An adjudicative route could yield binding determinations but would likely be politically fraught and time‑consuming; diplomatic settlement would be quicker but contingent on political compromise.

Regional diplomacy and normative effects
- The FAO opinion and the UNGA resolution together increase diplomatic pressure on regional bodies and IOTC members to treat Mauritius as the appropriate coastal authority for matters arising from the Chagos Archipelago. In practical terms, regional states that rely on the legitimacy and technical authority of FAO and UNGA pronouncements may reconfigure their dealings—e.g., entering access arrangements with Mauritius, directing catch data through Mauritius’ national reporting channels, or supporting Mauritius in multilateral fora.  
- For regional states this is not merely a fisheries issue: recognition practices embed wider norms about territorial sovereignty, governance legitimacy and the sequencing of decolonization claims.

Implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s security and strategic outlook in the western Indian Ocean is attentive to the intersection of maritime governance, basing and presence of extra‑regional powers, and the stability of the maritime commons. The FAO opinion matters to India for several reasons:
  - normative precedent: shifting recognition of coastal authority in the Chagos case strengthens precedents for how sovereignty disputes translate into functional governance outcomes in regional institutions — a relevant dynamic for India’s own approach to order in the Indian Ocean;
  - operational environment: changes in licensing, enforcement and reporting can affect fisheries patterns, maritime traffic, and the operational freedom of regional navies and coast guards—factors that inform India’s maritime domain awareness and resource protection priorities;
  - great‑power presence and basing: Diego Garcia’s strategic role for allied militaries complicates any change in administrative control; India monitors how governance shifts could alter base access dynamics or coalition postures in the region; and
  - diplomacy and partnerships: India’s close ties with Mauritius and its broader Indian Ocean engagement mean that developments strengthening Mauritius’ functional authority align with India’s preference for regional states to play leading roles in governance and security arrangements.
- Consequently, the FAO opinion both signals and accelerates a re‑politicization of maritime governance in the western Indian Ocean in ways that intersect with India’s strategic calculations about influence, security partnerships and the management of maritime resources.

Conclusion
- The May 2022 FAO legal opinion — read alongside UNGA resolution 73/295 — concludes that the UK should not be treated as a coastal state for the Chagos Archipelago, producing a practical reclassification in IOTC terms: the UK may fish in the region but lacks the coastal‑state rights and obligations that form the backbone of zone‑based fisheries governance.  
- While advisory in legal force, the opinion has tangible legal, diplomatic and fisheries‑management consequences. It alters expectations about licensing, enforcement, reporting, and negotiation of access arrangements, intensifies regional diplomatic pressure to recognize Mauritius as the coastal authority for Chagos‑related matters, and poses strategically relevant implications for India and other regional actors concerned with maritime governance, presence and security in the western Indian Ocean.
