### SESAME: A Case Study in Science Diplomacy and Regional Cooperation

Overview
- SESAME (Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) is an independent international laboratory located in Allan, Balqa governorate, Jordan. Established under the auspices of UNESCO on 30 May 2002, SESAME was conceived as a shared scientific infrastructure to promote cooperation among Middle Eastern states through “science for peace.”
- The idea dates back to the 1980s and gained concrete momentum after discussions at CERN in 1993. Ground was broken on 6 January 2003; construction commenced in July 2003; the facility was formally inaugurated on 16 May 2017. Construction costs were approximately US$98 million.

Why SESAME was created and why it matters
- Primary aim: foster scientific cooperation and confidence-building among regional actors whose political relations are otherwise fraught. SESAME is one of the most prominent examples of science diplomacy: an apolitical, technical domain used to build channels of sustained interaction.
- Scientific purpose: as a synchrotron radiation facility, SESAME enables high-resolution research across materials science, structural biology, environmental science, archaeology and cultural heritage—fields with direct societal benefit for the region (water and soil studies, pollutants, medical imaging, conservation of artefacts).
- Strategic symbolism: hosting the region’s only synchrotron signalled an investment in indigenous research capacity and presented a modeller for cooperative regional governance outside security-centred frameworks.

Founding membership, site choice and material support
- Founding members included Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey. Jordan was chosen as the site in part because, at the time of selection, it maintained formal diplomatic relations with all founding participants—a pragmatic choice to lower political barriers to a shared installation.
- CERN’s role was decisive: significant in-kind contributions (donated accelerator equipment and expertise) enabled the project to proceed without the full direct cost of new instrumentation.
- Initial financial structure: several principal contributions were made early in the project (notably US$5 million each from Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Iran and the European Union). Jordan’s contributions extended beyond cash: land, building construction, and a pledge to host a US$7 million solar power plant to supply SESAME with renewable energy.

Governance and operational model
- SESAME’s governance combined scientific autonomy with intergovernmental oversight. The SESAME Council—composed of member-state representatives—oversees policy and funding. Leadership in the Council and at the facility level has evolved over time; notable figures in the early years included Herwig Schopper and Christopher Llewellyn Smith in Council leadership, with Khaled Toukan as facility director through the inauguration period.
- Operational funding was budgeted at roughly US$6 million per year; the model envisaged member contributions scaled to economic capacity, a proportional-sharing arrangement designed to distribute recurrent costs while reinforcing shared ownership.

Operational achievements and technical capacity
- SESAME occupies a particular niche: at the time of its inauguration it was the only synchrotron in the Middle East and, globally, one among roughly sixty such facilities. It has enabled user access to cutting‑edge techniques that otherwise required travel to Europe or North America.
- Research scope: protein crystallography and structural biology (health and biomedicine), materials characterization (industrial and nanotechnology applications), environmental monitoring and analysis (pollutants, water studies), and non-destructive analysis of cultural patrimony—areas with clear practical dividends for member states.
- Recent operational updates (user-provided): SESAME has been operating for several years, now supports three beamlines, and inaugurated the HESEB beamline in June 2022. The facility also changed its logo in the period after formal opening—symbolic of its transition from project to established laboratory.

Practical challenges and limits
- Political tensions among member states create persistent governance and operational risks (delays in payments, visa and travel constraints for scientists, and the need to sustain a deliberately apolitical institutional posture).
- Technical and human-capacity constraints: building and staffing specialized beamlines, developing local user communities, and maintaining high-availability operations require long-term investment in training, expatriate expertise and cooperation with established laboratories.
- Financial sustainability: capital donations and loaned equipment (e.g., from CERN) lower initial costs, but recurring operational funding is non-trivial and dependent on the political will of members; reliance on pledged proportional contributions can be vulnerable to economic and political cycles.
- Logistics and sustainability innovations: the planned solar plant aimed to make SESAME one of the first accelerators powered substantially by renewable energy—an explicitly symbolic and practical step toward operational resilience and regional leadership in “green” big science.

Analytical lessons for Indian strategic culture and national-security policy
- Science diplomacy as a foreign policy instrument: SESAME demonstrates how scientific infrastructure can be a durable platform for confidence-building. For India — a regional power with ambitions for constructive engagement across South Asia and the wider Indian Ocean region — supporting or initiating similar cooperative scientific platforms can expand non-military influence and create sustained people-to-people ties.
- Institutional design: SESAME’s model—UNESCO auspices, member-proportional financing, technical partnerships with established organisations (CERN)—offers a replicable template. India can adapt elements (e.g., in SAARC, BIMSTEC or IORA contexts) to create cooperative science hubs that reduce barriers to participation (neutral hosting, shared governance, external technical partners).
- Leveraging soft power and technical assistance: India’s strengths in space, nuclear research, and pharmaceutical industries position it to be a natural collaborator or donor to regional facilities. Targeted investment in joint infrastructure bolsters credibility in peaceful technology transfer and counters narratives of exclusion.
- Security considerations: scientific collaboration is not a panacea—SESAME’s experience shows that political conflict can persist beneath cooperative veneers. Indian policymakers should integrate robust risk assessments (financial, political, cyber/dual-use concerns) into any program marrying large-scale science and diplomacy.
- Operational sustainability and innovation: SESAME’s renewable-energy ambition and proportional funding model provide policy-relevant lessons on reducing long-term costs and increasing buy-in. India, with its renewable-energy industrial capacity, could play a constructive role in both financing and technology transfer for energy-resilient science infrastructure.

Concluding observations and points for monitoring
- SESAME is a compact, high-value example of how shared scientific infrastructure can serve both research and geopolitical ends. Its trajectory — from conception in the 1980s to operation in the 2010s and beamline expansion into the 2020s — highlights the long horizons and patient diplomacy such projects require.
- Items to monitor (for scholars and policy-makers): current leadership and Council composition; the number and scientific scope of operational beamlines (now reported as three, with HESEB inaugurated June 2022); patterns of member payments and any changes in membership; user statistics and flagship scientific outputs; and the realization/operation of the pledged solar-energy supply.
- For India’s strategic culture: SESAME reinforces that investments in cooperative science are a stable, relatively low-risk instrument to project influence, build regional resilience, and create constituencies for peaceful interaction—complementary to, but distinct from, conventional security tools.

This concise case study should be read as part of a broader argument: scientific infrastructure can be an intentional element of national-security policy when configured to generate enduring interdependence, credible neutrality, and tangible societal benefits. SESAME’s mixed technical success and persistent political constraints offer both encouragement and caution for states — including India — seeking to use “big science” as a lever of strategic engagement.

## Synchrotron Light: Science, Institutions, and Strategic Significance

Synchrotron light (also called synchrotron radiation) is a distinct scientific phenomenon and an institutional asset with implications for national research capacity, technological development, and international diplomacy. In the context of a study on India’s strategic culture and national security policy, understanding synchrotron facilities clarifies how investments in big-science infrastructure contribute both to hard scientific capabilities and to soft‑power, regional engagement, and dual-use technology ecosystems.

Definition and physical mechanism
- Synchrotron light is the electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles—typically electrons—when they are accelerated transversely (forced to change direction) while travelling at velocities close to the speed of light.  
- Practically, electrons circulating in a storage ring are steered by magnetic fields (dipoles, wigglers, undulators). The rapid change of velocity vector produces extremely bright, highly collimated radiation that spans a broad spectrum, from the infrared through ultraviolet to hard X-rays.  
- Because of their intensity and tunability, synchrotron sources are the brightest artificial sources of X‑rays available to researchers, enabling measurements and imaging at resolutions and contrasts unattainable with conventional laboratory X‑ray tubes.

Technical characteristics
- Spectral coverage: synchrotron facilities produce radiation across a wide spectral range; individual beamlines and insertion devices are tuned to deliver specific wavelength bands and coherence properties required by different experiments.  
- Beamlines: a large synchrotron hosts many beamlines, each optimized for techniques such as diffraction, spectroscopy, imaging and tomography; users are allocated beam time to match their experimental requirements.

Historical evolution and change of purpose
- The earliest synchrotrons were developed as accelerators primarily to study nuclear and particle physics—accelerating particles for collisions and nuclear investigations. Synchrotron radiation was initially an incidental by‑product.  
- Over time the emitted radiation itself became the principal product. Facilities were re‑purposed or newly built as “dedicated synchrotron light sources,” designed from the ground up to maximize brightness, stability, and beamline diversity for multidisciplinary research.

Global scale and major facilities
- Today nearly 60 dedicated synchrotron light sources operate worldwide, forming a global infrastructure that supports international scientific communities.  
- Prominent facilities include ESRF (France), APS (USA), SPring-8 (Japan), Diamond (UK), and SESAME (Jordan)—the latter notable as a regional, multinational facility in the Middle East. India maintains national facilities (e.g., the Indus complex) that contribute to domestic capacity and regional collaborations.

Scientific, technological, and societal applications
- Synchrotron radiation underpins a broad array of disciplines and techniques:
  - Structural biology and crystallography (determination of macromolecular structures at atomic or near-atomic resolution)  
  - Condensed matter physics and materials science (electronic structure, magnetic properties, nanomaterials)  
  - Spectroscopy and chemical imaging (elemental mapping, oxidation states)  
  - Tomography and high‑resolution imaging (non‑destructive 3D visualization)  
  - Environmental science and archaeology/cultural heritage (trace-element analysis, provenance studies, non‑destructive examination of artifacts)
- Typical user communities include physicists, chemists, material scientists, biologists, archaeologists, and environmental researchers. Common experimental techniques are X‑ray diffraction, X‑ray crystallography, X‑ray absorption spectroscopy, small-angle scattering, imaging, and tomography.

Governance, access, and modes of cooperation
- Synchrotron facilities function principally as user facilities. Access is largely meritocratic and proposal-based: researchers submit proposals that are peer‑reviewed and granted beam time according to scientific merit and feasibility.  
- Facilities encourage international collaboration, training of early-career scientists, and technology transfer (instrumentation, detectors, computing). Many operate with international advisory committees and host visiting researchers from across borders.

Strategic and policy implications (relevance to India’s strategic culture)
- Scientific capability and national security: synchrotron facilities generate high‑resolution diagnostic and analytical capabilities useful for materials characterization, nuclear forensics, and advanced materials development—areas with clear intersections with national security and defence R&D.  
- Industrial and technological competitiveness: capabilities developed around synchrotrons accelerate innovation in sectors such as semiconductor materials, pharmaceuticals, and advanced manufacturing—contributing to economic resilience and technological sovereignty.  
- Capacity building and human capital: operating a national synchrotron fosters specialized training, retains scientific talent, and creates a cadre of experts in accelerator physics, beamline instrumentation, and data science—skills that have spillover value for defence and civil sectors alike.  
- Scientific diplomacy and regional influence: participation in or support for regional facilities (notably SESAME in the Middle East) demonstrates how big‑science projects can function as instruments of soft power and confidence‑building. For India, investments in regional scientific cooperation—through facility access, joint projects, or training—can complement traditional diplomatic channels, projecting leadership in science while fostering interoperability and trust among neighbouring states.  
- Institutional culture and strategic calculations: the decision to build or partner in large facilities reflects a strategic culture that values long‑term investment in knowledge infrastructure; it signals priorities in statecraft that extend beyond immediate military capabilities toward sustained technological and scientific preeminence.

Societal benefits and ethical considerations
- Beyond strategic calculus, synchrotrons provide clear societal returns: non‑destructive analysis of cultural heritage, environmental monitoring, and public‑health contributions through structural biology (drug design). Policymakers must weigh these benefits against costs, governance transparency, and equitable access—especially when facilities are funded by public resources.

Concluding synthesis and dedication
- Synchrotron light bridges fundamental physics and applied research: a phenomenon born of accelerator physics has become a cornerstone of contemporary multidisciplinary science. Its institutional embodiment—national and regional synchrotron facilities—serves simultaneously as engines of innovation, instruments of international engagement, and strategic assets in a nation's science and security portfolio.  
- This section is dedicated with respect to the spirit of scientific internationalism exemplified by Nobel laureate Mohammad Abdus Salam, whose advocacy for science in the developing world resonates with the diplomatic and capacity‑building roles that regional synchrotron facilities can fulfil.

Key takeaways
- Synchrotron radiation is produced when relativistic charged particles are deflected by magnetic fields and is the brightest artificial source of X‑rays, enabling detailed molecular and materials studies.  
- The field evolved from accelerator physics into a multidisciplinary, user‑centric global infrastructure—about 60 dedicated sources worldwide—that supports diverse scientific techniques and communities.  
- For India, and for regional policy, synchrotrons matter not only for pure science but also as instruments of strategic capacity, industrial competitiveness, human capital development, and scientific diplomacy.

### SESAME: A Case Study in Science Diplomacy and Regional Security Cooperation

Overview  
The genesis, establishment and opening of SESAME (Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) is a compact illustration of how large-scale scientific infrastructure can be deliberately used as an instrument of international reintegration, confidence‑building and capacity‑building in a politically fraught region. The story—from early visionary appeals by Abdus Salam through a practical plan to relocate an existing European synchrotron, to UNESCO‑brokered intergovernmental organisation and the centre’s eventual 2017 inauguration—contains lessons for strategic actors (including India) about the intersection of science, diplomacy and national security policy.

1. Genesis and early vision
- Longstanding aspiration: For nearly four decades prior to SESAME’s opening, leading scientists argued that a sizeable, internationally governed scientific project could help reintegrate the Middle East into global science and create a neutral space for cooperation.  
- Abdus Salam: At the 1979 Nobel Prize banquet and again publicly in 1983 (11 May symposium, Bahrain), Salam advocated equal opportunity in physics and proposed concrete initiatives: a “Super Gulf University” and an international materials‑science laboratory in Bahrain, explicitly including a synchrotron radiation light source.  
- Early failure and political lessons: Salam’s 1983 proposal failed to gain traction largely because it was sponsored by a single university — a political and organisational weakness that underlined the need for a broader consortium and an intergovernmental model.

2. From idea to practicable project: the BESSY I proposal (1997–1999)
- Technical opportunity: In the late 1990s Herman Winick and Gustav‑Adolf Voss proposed relocating components from the decommissioned BESSY I (Berlin) to the Middle East. Reusing BESSY I promised reduced cost and shorter implementation time compared with building wholly new hardware.  
- Organisation and advocacy: Two preparatory seminars (1997, Italy; 1998, Sweden), organised by Tord Ekelöf under the aegis of the CERN‑based Middle East Scientific Co‑operation (MESC) group led by Sergio Fubini, helped convert the idea into a concrete plan. Winick is widely credited with initiating the relocation idea; MESC adopted and actively advanced it.  
- German support: At the request of Fubini and Herwig Schopper, the German government agreed to donate necessary equipment, a critical material contribution that transformed feasibility assessments.

3. Institutionalisation under UNESCO and the CERN model
- Seeking the right institutional framework: Project proponents concluded that the only realistic political model was CERN — an international, intergovernmental organisation that insulated scientific cooperation from bilateral political disputes. This conclusion shaped the pursuit of intergovernmental backing.  
- UNESCO convening role: Federico Mayor (UNESCO Director‑General) convened a Consultative Meeting at UNESCO (June 1999, Paris) on creating a Middle East Synchrotron Light Facility. That meeting effectively launched the project and established an International Interim Council chaired by Herwig Schopper, whose leadership became central to the project’s governance and external advocacy.  
- UNESCO endorsement: In May 2002 UNESCO’s Executive Board and Director‑General unanimously approved the establishment of the Centre under UNESCO auspices via 31C/Resolution 19 — a decisive political legitimisation that facilitated membership recruitment and donor engagement.

4. Construction, founding membership and opening
- Groundbreaking and interim arrangements: The SESAME groundbreaking took place at Al‑Balqa’ Applied University, Jordan (6 January 2003). Until the SESAME building was completed (2008), the project operated from offices at the UNESCO Office in Amman.  
- Formal establishment and membership evolution: The Centre formally came into existence in April 2004 once a sufficient number of Members had acceded; a permanent Council replaced the interim body. Founding members included Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan and Turkey. Over time membership and participation evolved; current members include (among others) Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey, while a wide array of states and organisations — Brazil, Canada, China, the European Union, many European states and the United States — have observer status and provide technical and financial support.  
- Official opening: After construction and commissioning phases, SESAME was officially opened by King Abdullah II of Jordan on 16 May 2017.

5. Science, technology and political design
- What a synchrotron is and why it matters: A synchrotron is a particle accelerator that produces intense, tunable electromagnetic radiation (X‑rays, ultraviolet) used across materials science, biology, medicine, archaeology and cultural heritage. SESAME was designed to provide a regional facility for these disciplines, addressing both scientific needs and applied priorities (e.g., medicine, industry, heritage science).  
- Model and practical design choices: By explicitly modelling governance on CERN and by reusing BESSY I components, SESAME balanced political legitimacy, cost‑effectiveness and speed of implementation. UNESCO’s role provided convening power and international legitimacy while donor states and observers supplied technical assistance and funding.

6. Political significance, benefits and challenges
- Science diplomacy in practice: SESAME’s multinational membership — including states with historical adversarial relations — makes it a salient example of science diplomacy and “regional confidence building through shared science.” It provides a neutral platform for professional interactions that can reduce misconceptions, build trust and produce practical spillovers (joint publications, training, mobility).  
- Capacity building and human capital: Beyond instruments, SESAME’s mandate emphasises training regional scientists and technicians, strengthening local research ecosystems and creating retention pathways for scientific talent.  
- Resource and sustainability challenges: Sustained funding, maintenance of complex technical systems, and the need for experienced technical staff are ongoing vulnerabilities. Political tensions in the region also pose intermittent risks to long‑term cooperation and funding continuity.  
- Dual‑use and security considerations: Large scientific infrastructures involve technologies with potential dual‑use implications and therefore require clear export‑control, oversight and confidence‑building measures to reassure states about non‑proliferation and security concerns.

7. Lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Science diplomacy as a strategic instrument: SESAME demonstrates how a government can deploy scientific infrastructure to pursue soft power, stabilisation and long‑term security interests without coercion. For India, the case underscores the value of integrating scientific cooperation into broader strategic outreach in South Asia and neighbouring regions.  
- Institutional choice matters: The SESAME experience highlights the advantages of multilateral, intergovernmental structures (neutral governance, legitimacy, broader donor base) when projects aim at regional integration across political divides. India should weigh similar institutional forms when sponsoring regional initiatives.  
- Pragmatism in resource use: Reuse of decommissioned, high‑value hardware (BESSY I) reduced cost and schedule risk. Indian policy can profit from pragmatic asset‑recycling, transfers and capacity partnerships to expand regional scientific access cost‑effectively.  
- Balancing openness and security: SESAME required export‑control assurances and transparency to manage dual‑use worries. India’s policy frameworks must similarly reconcile openness for scientific cooperation with non‑proliferation and national security safeguards.  
- Investment in human capital: The strategic payoff of facilities like SESAME derives as much from training and networks as from instruments. India’s national security calculus should therefore value long‑term investments in regional scientific capacity as contributors to stability, resilience and allied capabilities.

8. Milestone timeline (concise)
- 1979: Abdus Salam’s Nobel banquet appeal for equal opportunity in science.  
- 11 May 1983: Salam proposes Super Gulf University and materials‑science lab (Bahrain).  
- 1997–1998: Winick, Voss and MESC seminars propose moving BESSY I to the Middle East.  
- June 1999: UNESCO Consultative Meeting (Paris); International Interim Council established, chaired by Herwig Schopper.  
- May 2002: UNESCO Executive Board approves establishment (31C/Resolution 19).  
- 6 Jan 2003: Groundbreaking at Al‑Balqa’ Applied University, Jordan.  
- 2004: SESAME formally established after sufficient Members joined; permanent Council formed.  
- 2008: SESAME building completed (project operations transition).  
- 16 May 2017: Official opening by King Abdullah II of Jordan.

Conclusion  
SESAME is not only a technical or institutional achievement; it is a deliberate experiment in using science as a means of regional engagement. The project’s trajectory — champions such as Abdus Salam and Herwig Schopper, the pragmatic recycling of BESSY I, UNESCO’s convening role, and the adoption of a CERN‑style intergovernmental model — offers concrete design choices and cautionary lessons for policymakers. For India’s strategic culture, SESAME illustrates how investments in shared scientific infrastructure can serve national security objectives indirectly by fostering stability, creating influence, and building resilient regional scientific capacity.

### Case Study: UNESCO, SESAME and the Politics of Scientific Infrastructure — Lessons for India’s Strategic Culture

This episode — centered on UNESCO’s role in establishing SESAME (Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) and the transfer of components from Germany’s BESSY I facility — is useful for understanding how international science projects intersect with export controls, public anxiety about proliferation, diplomatic procedure, and the discretionary power of international civil servants. The case highlights practical and normative lessons for states like India that balance scientific cooperation, non‑proliferation commitments, and national security sensibilities.

Background and immediate facts
- SESAME is an international synchrotron research facility hosted in Jordan, designed to foster scientific cooperation among Middle Eastern countries. BESSY I was an earlier German synchrotron whose hardware was repurposed for SESAME.
- During the pre‑establishment phase of SESAME a controversy erupted over the financing and physical transfer of BESSY I components. German and French ambassadors to UNESCO formally complained that Director‑General Kōichirō Matsuura had not followed UNESCO protocol in making a funding decision for the project.
- Schopper (an influential scientific interlocutor in the case) explained the difficult circumstances of the project to the diplomats; following that explanation, the ambassadors withdrew their complaints.

Discretionary funds and administrative practice
- One practical reason the funding decision drew criticism was that Matsuura had access to discretionary funds — a Director‑General level allocation (here originating from the Japanese government upon his appointment) that permits quick support for initiatives without going through protracted formal approval processes.
- Discretionary budgets are an important administrative tool for international organizations, enabling timely action in politically sensitive or technically urgent cases. At the same time, their use can raise concerns about transparency, norms of collective decision‑making, and the political optics of “back‑channel” funding.

Export authorizations and proliferation fears
- SESAME encountered a separate and serious setback when the German government was asked to revoke export authorization for BESSY I components. Public criticism in some quarters alleged the synchrotron could be used to produce fissile material (e.g., plutonium) for weapons — a classic dual‑use anxiety.
- Such allegations show how export controls on scientific equipment are shaped not only by technical facts but also by public perceptions and political pressure. Governments and institutions must therefore be prepared for both legal review and reputational contestation.

Public debate, expert dialogue and technical resolution
- The controversy spilled into public fora. Schopper engaged in a televised discussion with Professor Dr. Reinhard Brandt, a public critic. This sort of expert‑to‑expert engagement in the media can be decisive.
- Schopper’s technical explanation — acknowledging that while a synchrotron could in principle be associated with tiny production of fissile isotopes, the quantities would be far too small and impractical for weaponization — helped defuse concerns. After these clarifications the substantive objections were resolved.
- This sequence underlines that technical clarifications, communicated credibly and transparently, often resolve proliferation fears more effectively than procedural assurances alone.

Logistics and interim arrangements: the role of free zones
- The BESSY I hardware did physically move: shipped from Berlin to Hamburg and onward to the Zarqa Free Zone in Jordan. Jordan held the components there until SESAME was formally established and the host facility was ready to receive them.
- Using a free zone as interim storage is a pragmatic logistics solution that allows transfer of goods while legal, organizational, and site‑readiness conditions are finalized. It also creates a clear chain‑of‑custody that governmental and international stakeholders can monitor.

Safeguards, transparency and institutional prerequisites
- The episode illustrates several recurring requirements before major scientific equipment is transferred to multinational facilities: formal founding of the international organization, host‑facility readiness, and legally clear transfer arrangements.
- International safeguards (for nuclear‑adjacent technologies this typically involves IAEA engagement) and explicit non‑proliferation measures are crucial for reassuring both governments and the public.
- Transparency — including public communication, open expert debate, and accessible technical assessments — proved essential to defusing controversy and building confidence.

Implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Science diplomacy and national security: India’s strategic culture recognizes the promotional value of international scientific cooperation (soft power, regional ties, capacity building) but also treats dual‑use concerns seriously. The SESAME episode reinforces the need to embed scientific collaboration within robust non‑proliferation and export‑control frameworks.
- Export controls and technical assessment: Policymakers must ensure that export authorization processes combine legal rigor with rapid, credible technical assessment so that legitimate scientific projects are not derailed by misperception. India’s export control lists, inter‑agency review processes, and technical advisory capacity should be periodically reviewed in light of such cases.
- Discretionary funding: Discretionary mechanisms enable timely support for diplomacy and science initiatives, but they require clear rules and transparency to avoid allegations of impropriety. India’s bureaucratic practice should couple discretionary actions with after‑the‑fact reporting and institutional oversight.
- Public communications and expert engagement: Public skepticism about scientific infrastructure often stems from technical unfamiliarity. India should invest in authoritative, accessible explanations and in marshaling respected technical experts to engage public audiences and foreign interlocutors when controversies arise.
- Logistics and legal staging: The use of neutral interim arrangements (free zones, custodial agreements) can be an effective way to manage complex transfers while legal and organizational prerequisites are met. India’s agreements with partners should be explicit about storage, custody, and condition precedents for transfer.
- Multilateral safeguards and credibility: Participation in and adherence to international safeguards (and cooperation with bodies such as the IAEA) are powerful instruments to demonstrate good faith and manage external anxieties. For India, maintaining and communicating clear safeguards and export‑control compliance can enhance its international scientific partnerships without compromising security.

Conclusion
The UNESCO–SESAME–BESSY episode is a compact illustration of how international science projects become entangled with diplomacy, domestic and foreign political pressures, and security concerns. The resolution depended less on legal fiat than on credible technical explanation, careful staging of transfers, and transparent institutional practice. For India — a state that simultaneously pursues advanced scientific capabilities and a principled non‑proliferation stance — the case offers practical prescriptions: strengthen technical review capacities, codify transparent discretionary procedures, employ interim custody arrangements prudently, and prioritize public and expert communication to bridge the gap between scientific opportunity and security apprehension.

## Location

The question of where to locate SESAME — the regional synchrotron-light facility conceived to foster scientific cooperation across the Middle East — was not a technical afterthought but a precondition for the project’s formal endorsement. UNESCO made clear that a host country and a viable site had to be identified before it could extend formal approval. That requirement forced the Interim Council to treat site selection as a multidimensional political, financial and technical decision: one that would determine whether SESAME could function as an open, regional research infrastructure and as an instrument of scientific diplomacy.

### Interim Council criteria and procedural posture
The Interim Council formulated explicit criteria for any prospective host:
- Geographic and political accessibility to scientists from all member and neighbouring states (an “open‑access” guarantee was essential).  
- A firm, long‑term commitment from the host government, including predictable financial support.  
- Free provision of land for the facility.  
- Provision of basic building and technical infrastructure (roads, water, reliable electricity) or clear, credible plans to supply them.

These criteria reflected both scientific realities (synchrotrons require stable utilities and a campus environment) and political imperatives — above all, the need to guarantee uninhibited international access so SESAME could serve as a genuinely regional, collaborative instrument rather than a national or exclusionary resource.

### Candidate submissions and site visits
Seven members of the later SESAME Council (Armenia, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, Turkey) submitted a total of twelve candidate sites for consideration. To assess these claims, UNESCO’s Assistant Director‑General Maurizio Iaccarino and former CERN Director Herwig Schopper carried out inspection visits in September 1999 to sites in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian territories. (Proposals from Armenia, Iran and Turkey were examined principally within the Interim Council’s meetings rather than via those particular field inspections.)

The inspections followed standard practice for large transnational research infrastructure: on‑site technical appraisal, meetings with senior national authorities to assess political will and funding commitments, and evaluation of questions of access and openness.

### Why some proposals succeeded on paper and others failed
National proposals were evaluated against the combined yardstick of access, finances (including the ability to meet construction and operating costs), technical readiness of any existing accelerator infrastructure or buildings, and the political assurances that would permit researchers from all member states to use the facility.

- Egypt. The Egyptian submission initially showed strong interest and potential. However, bureaucratic delays in elevating the proposal to senior decision‑making levels and securing the necessary state guarantees meant the offer could not meet the Interim Council’s time‑sensitive requirements. Technical willingness was present, but administrative momentum was insufficient.

- Palestine. The Palestinian National Authority expressed firm political interest, but lacked the financial capacity to guarantee land, infrastructure and long‑term support in the manner the Interim Council required. In other words, political goodwill existed but fiscal and infrastructural means did not.

- Israel. Israel’s case illustrated how pre‑existing scientific engagement and political sensitivities interact. Israel could not propose a site that was politically acceptable and physically accessible to researchers from all requested countries. Moreover, Israeli laboratories already had strong institutional ties to the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, including contractual funding obligations — reducing both the perceived need to host and the political appetite for a new regional facility. Some Israeli biologists also judged that the marginal scientific benefit from SESAME would be limited given their existing access to other international facilities.

- Armenia. Armenia proposed the Synchrotron Laboratory in Yerevan. The offer was bolstered by the involvement of Kevork Hovnanian, a prominent Armenian‑American philanthropist, whose potential private support strengthened the political case. Nevertheless, technical assessment revealed that the existing accelerator and building would require substantial retrofitting and structural alteration to meet SESAME’s specifications. Thus, while Armenia had political will and a diaspora donor, the site posed non‑trivial technical and cost implications.

- Iran. Iran’s technical interest and capabilities were present, but at the time Iran’s international standing — characterised by political isolation and sanctions‑related restrictions — meant it could not credibly guarantee unimpeded access to scientists from all participating states. The Interim Council judged that geopolitical constraints and the risk of restricted access rendered Iran’s proposal unacceptable for the open, regional mission SESAME was intended to fulfil.

- Turkey, Jordan, Oman and other proposals. These were assessed within the same matrix. Some candidate sites offered varying degrees of technical readiness or political accessibility, but none combined all required elements sufficiently early in the process to displace the emerging consensus around alternative options.

### Cross‑cutting factors shaping the outcome
Three categories of factors repeatedly determined the viability of proposals:

- Political and access considerations. The need for an unambiguous, unconditional open‑access guarantee was arguably the decisive non‑technical criterion. Geopolitical tensions, sanction regimes or inability to assure visitors’ freedoms could disqualify otherwise competent hosts.

- Financial and institutional commitment. A facility like SESAME requires not only an initial capital outlay but sustained operating funding. National pledges of long‑term support — and the immediate capacity to provide land and infrastructure — were necessary to move from promise to construction.

- Technical readiness. Existing accelerators or buildings could shorten timelines and reduce costs, but their technical condition mattered. Armenia’s retrofitting needs showed that a nominal “ready site” could still impose high conversion costs; private donors could strengthen the case but could not substitute for technical suitability or state guarantees.

### Implications for science diplomacy and strategic policy
The SESAME location debate illustrates how scientific infrastructure projects serve as crucibles where diplomacy, national prestige, security considerations and scientific practice intersect. For states and regional organizations, hosting a large research infrastructure confers soft‑power benefits and opportunities for capacity building — but these gains are balanced against the political necessity of making access universal and the material demands of construction and operation. International perceptions (e.g., whether a state is under sanction or viewed as a security risk) can quickly overwhelm technical or financial advantages. Conversely, diaspora philanthropy and scientific networks can bolster but not replace the foundations of a credible host proposal.

Conclusion
The “Location” decision for SESAME was governed by an exacting set of interlocking criteria — open access, host political and financial commitment, free provision of land, and adequate infrastructure — and by pragmatic technical assessments of candidate sites. The outcome underscored that successful transnational research infrastructures require more than scientific enthusiasm: they demand stable state guarantees, geopolitical permissibility, and technical viability. Proposals from Egypt, Palestine, Armenia, Iran and Israel each failed or qualified for reasons that combined bureaucratic delay, fiscal incapacity, retrofit costs, existing international commitments, or geopolitical isolation. This case demonstrates how infrastructure siting is as much a question of strategic culture and international politics as it is of engineering.

## Case study: SESAME and the politics of hosting — lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Background and significance
- SESAME (Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) is an intergovernmental scientific centre conceived to provide a shared large-scale research facility for countries in a politically fractured region. Its creation is frequently cited as a paradigmatic instance of “science diplomacy”: a technical project designed to build cooperative ties across diplomatic divides, including between Israel and Iran.
- The decision to locate SESAME in Jordan in June 2000 is a concentrated example of how personal networks, multilateral facilitation and high-level political intervention combine to resolve site competition for strategically sensitive international projects. For scholars of strategic culture, it offers a compact empirical episode from which to draw wider inferences about state behaviour, soft-power construction and the securitised governance of technology.

Chronology and key actors (condensed)
- Adnan Badran (then UNESCO deputy director, 1992–1998) convened an early meeting in Jordan with university and organisational representatives to advance the project. No formal government commitment emerged from that meeting.
- When the project faced a critical impasse, Franz Schopper (project lead) re‑established contact with his former student Isa Khubeis, then vice‑president of Al‑Balqa Applied University. Khubeis arranged a dinner that brought together Schopper and Italian collaborator Iaccarino with Khaled Toukan (President of Al‑Balqa) and Prince Ghazi Bin Muhammad.
- Prince Ghazi, who chaired Al‑Balqa’s Board of Governors and acted as a close adviser to King Abdullah II, was briefed on the project’s precarious status. He rapidly secured a meeting with King Abdullah II the next day. The King formally committed Jordan to host SESAME by signing a letter addressed to UNESCO’s Director‑General.
- At the third meeting of the SESAME Interim Council in June 2000, after deliberation and voting, Jordan’s candidacy was ratified: nine votes in favour, one abstention. Egypt and Iran had withdrawn their own site proposals prior to the final round, materially easing consensus. An important practical determinant cited in deliberations was Jordan’s unique diplomatic position at the time — it maintained relations with all founding members (Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority and Turkey), making it a politically acceptable neutral host.

Mechanisms that produced the outcome
- Personal networks and informal advocacy: The decisive sequence — a contact between a project leader and a former student, a facilitated dinner, and rapid escalations to royal-level interlocutors — underscores how interpersonal ties and ad hoc brokerage can substitute for formal diplomatic manoeuvre when time is short and stakes are high.
- High‑level political intervention: Royal involvement converted informal goodwill into a binding state-level commitment. The swift endorsement by King Abdullah II demonstrates how executive imprimatur can close gaps that technical committees and bureaucratic processes cannot.
- Multilateral facilitation: UNESCO’s role as convener and legitimising actor created the institutional space within which a politically neutral host could be identified and endorsed. International organisations can thus both depoliticise and legitimise contested technical endeavours.
- Diplomatic neutrality as an asset: Jordan’s capacity to engage all founding members was an explicit rationale for its selection. In multilateral projects where participants include states with strained bilateral ties, a host’s perceived neutrality and connectivity are strategic advantages.
- Withdrawal of competing candidates: The voluntary withdrawal of Egypt and Iran from the site competition reduced contestation and allowed coalition-building around Jordan — a reminder that host selection is as much about who exits as who enters the race.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Science diplomacy as strategic instrument: The SESAME episode illustrates how hosting large-scale collaborative scientific infrastructure can serve national interests beyond science — enhancing prestige, creating entry points for dialogue, and building institutional interdependence that dampens conflict. India’s strategic culture, increasingly oriented toward positive inducements and normative leadership, could leverage comparable initiatives in South Asia and the broader Indo‑Pacific.
- The centrality of high‑level political commitment: Indian bureaucratic fragmentation across ministries (External Affairs, Science & Technology, Department of Atomic Energy, etc.) means that credible offers to host multilateral scientific platforms will require explicit and rapid political endorsement at the highest levels — both to reassure partners and to mobilise domestic resources.
- Choosing neutral venues in divided regions: SESAME shows the value of a host with broad diplomatic reach. For India, any endeavour that aims to include Pakistan, China or other contentious regional actors will face heightened sensitivity; selecting a host or platform perceived as impartial will be essential to attract broad participation.
- The utility of personal networks and institutional champions: Indian scientific diplomacy should identify and empower influential scientists, university leaders and former diplomats who can operate across formal channels to broker agreements quickly. These actors proved decisive in the SESAME process.
- Risks and security trade‑offs: Hosting multinational scientific installations can enhance soft power but also raises security questions — technological leakage, sensitive collaborations, and domestic opposition. India’s national security calculus must weigh these risks, framing safeguards (clear governance, export controls, data security) into proposals from the outset.
- Multilateral organisations as force multipliers: UNESCO’s facilitation role demonstrates that international organisations can legitimise sensitive projects. India should work through and with multilateral bodies when proposing regional scientific platforms, using their convening authority to offset bilateral distrust.

Conclusion — a political milestone with transferable lessons
The June 2000 approval of Jordan as SESAME’s host encapsulates how informal interpersonal ties, royal patronage and multilateral facilitation converged to resolve a politically fraught technical decision. For India, the episode offers a compact playbook: cultivate institutional champions, secure upfront high‑level political commitment, exploit neutral hosting as a confidence‑building measure, and integrate security safeguards into scientific cooperation frameworks. Employed judiciously, such measures can make science diplomacy a durable instrument in India’s strategic repertoire.

## Financing the SESAME Facility: Structure, Contributions and Strategic Implications

This section summarizes and analyses the financing architecture of the SESAME synchrotron project, emphasizing capital composition, the predominance of in‑kind contributions, the outsized role of the host state (Jordan), the renewable‑energy innovation, and the ongoing operating‑cost regime. Although SESAME is a regional Middle Eastern scientific initiative, its financing model and the governance choices it embodies offer instructive lessons for policymakers concerned with scientific diplomacy, burden‑sharing and sustainability — issues relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security policy when it engages in or hosts international scientific infrastructure.

### 1. Quick facts (key numbers)
- Estimated total capital cost: ≈ USD 98 million.  
- Cash donations: USD 5 million each from Jordan, Israel, Turkey, Iran and the European Union — total cash = USD 25 million.  
- Remaining capital value covered by in‑kind contributions (equipment, land, construction, services).  
- CERN contributed accelerator equipment as an in‑kind donation.  
- Jordan donated the land, paid for building construction, and provided a USD 7 million solar power plant.  
- Annual operating budget: ≈ USD 6 million, shared among members in proportion to their economic size (i.e., an agreed‑upon GDP‑based or similar formula).

### 2. Capital structure and the mix of cash vs. in‑kind contributions
The project’s capital envelope (≈ USD 98 million) was financed through a relatively small core of direct cash grants (USD 25 million aggregate) and a larger quantum of in‑kind contributions. In‑kind inputs included donated technical equipment (notably from CERN), the host land and construction works, and other non‑cash services. This mix has several consequences:

- Advantages
  - Reduced immediate cash requirements for the international secretariat and members.
  - Leveraging established institutional capability (e.g., CERN’s technical donations) strengthens operational credibility.
  - Host and partner demonstrations of commitment can catalyse political momentum and attract further support.

- Constraints and risks
  - Valuation and accounting: physical donations must be assigned monetary values for reporting and balance‑sheet purposes; inconsistent valuation creates ambiguity in perceived ownership and equity.
  - Scheduling and delivery risk: in‑kind contributions often carry administrative and logistical dependencies that can delay commissioning.
  - Maintenance liabilities: donated capital (equipment, buildings, solar arrays) creates recurring upkeep demands that are sometimes under‑budgeted at project inception.

### 3. Jordan as host: scale and implications of the host‑nation contribution
Jordan emerged as the largest single contributor in both monetary and material terms:

- Contributions: land donation for the site, funding and oversight of the building construction, and provision of a USD 7 million solar power plant to supply the facility’s electricity needs.
- Significance:
  - Host states frequently assume higher up‑front costs to secure long‑term economic, scientific and diplomatic benefits. Jordan’s package reduced the need for cash transfers from multiple members and materially advanced project realization.
  - The host’s disproportionate share creates both leverage (influence over siting, security, and some operational priorities) and burden (responsibility for site maintenance, local infrastructure and possibly political risk management).
  - For collaborative governance, such asymmetry requires formal mechanisms (agreements, operating MOUs) to balance influence and obligations among partners.

### 4. Renewable energy: SESAME as a reputational and operational innovation
Jordan’s USD 7 million solar plant is credited with enabling SESAME to be “the first accelerator powered solely by renewable energy.” This claim has important symbolic and practical dimensions:

- Symbolic: positions the facility at the intersection of advanced science and sustainability — an important reputational asset for member states and funders.
- Practical: solar generation can reduce long‑term energy operating costs and hedge against fuel price volatility, but:
  - It introduces technical requirements for integration with the accelerator’s demand profile (constant, reliable power supply), storage or backup arrangements, and maintenance budgets.
  - The capital cost of the solar installation must be accounted for transparently: it may be part of the USD 98 million total or an additional Jordan contribution; the literature and project reports should be checked to avoid double‑counting when assessing total capital inputs.

### 5. Annual operating costs and burden‑sharing
SESAME’s recurring operating budget is approximately USD 6 million per year. This sustained cost base has governance and fiscal implications:

- Cost allocation method: operating expenditures are apportioned among members “according to sizes of their economies.” In practice this typically implies a GDP‑based formula or an agreed proportional scale that mirrors members’ economic capacity. The exact formula matters: it determines relative contributions, political acceptability, and predictability of revenue flows.
- Fiscal sustainability: the project’s long‑term viability depends on consistent member payments, contingency reserves for equipment replacement, and reserves for unforeseen political or economic shocks.
- Equity vs. reciprocity: while GDP‑proportional sharing is equitable in capacity terms, smaller or less wealthy members may seek in‑kind offsets (scientific time, training slots) or concessional rates — arrangements that need codification to avoid disputes.

### 6. Institutional backing and scientific diplomacy
CERN’s donation of equipment is more than a technical gift; it is a form of institutional endorsement:

- Technical legitimacy: support from a leading accelerator laboratory lowers technical risk, assists knowledge transfer, and enhances confidence among funders.
- Diplomatic signalling: external institutional involvement (CERN, the EU) multilaterally reinforces SESAME’s neutral, science‑first character, which is crucial in a politically sensitive region.
- For states like India, participation or partnership with such facilities can form part of a broader scientific‑diplomacy toolkit that advances soft power and builds technical networks without direct security entanglements.

### 7. Risks, governance needs and transparency issues
The financing model exposes specific governance challenges that need systematic mitigation:

- Valuation transparency: explicit accounting for in‑kind contributions (including whether the solar plant is included in the capital total) is necessary to produce a clear financial picture.
- Delivery risk management: timelines, acceptance criteria for in‑kind equipment, and contingency financing should be embedded in project agreements.
- Long‑run budgetary planning: operating reserves, lifecycle replacement costs and contingency for energy‑system maintenance must be identified and funded.
- Political risk: reliance on member payments exposes the facility to political disputes, economic crises, or shifts in domestic priorities of key contributors.

### 8. Policy lessons — relevance for India’s strategic posture
Although SESAME is regionally specific, its financing and governance carry transferable lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy when engaging in international scientific projects:

- Strategic hosting can yield diplomatic dividends but typically imposes higher upfront and long‑term obligations on the host state; careful cost–benefit analysis is required before assuming such roles.
- Mixed funding (cash + in‑kind) harnesses broader resources but demands rigorous valuation rules and delivery oversight to prevent hidden liabilities.
- Integrating sustainability (renewable energy) into flagship scientific infrastructure can enhance strategic narratives and reduce operating vulnerability, but it requires lifecycle budgeting and technical backup planning.
- Institutional partnerships (e.g., with established laboratories) are force multipliers for credibility and technical capacity, important considerations for India when shaping cooperative scientific engagements.

### 9. Conclusion
SESAME’s financing model — modest direct cash pledges combined with substantial in‑kind host and institutional contributions, plus an operating budget shared proportionally by members — exemplifies how scientific diplomacy is financed in practice. The project demonstrates both the opportunities of collaborative, resource‑diverse funding and the governance attention required to translate pledges into a sustainable, resilient facility. For practitioners and policymakers in India, SESAME offers a compact case study in balancing host burden, international legitimacy, renewable‑energy integration and long‑run fiscal planning when science infrastructure intersects with strategic objectives.

(For definitive accounting, readers should consult project financial statements and SESAME’s formal agreements to resolve the precise treatment of the solar plant within the USD 98 million capital figure.)

## Funding

The financing of SESAME (Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East) illustrates the complex mix of in‑kind donations, emergency diplomacy, technical conditionality and multilateral negotiation that commonly shapes large-scale international research infrastructure. The project’s funding history (1999–2019) is a compact case study in how technical requirements, donor conditions and institutional rules intersect with the political realities of regional cooperation.

### In‑kind donation and immediate conditional cost
- Germany donated major laboratory components from the decommissioned BESSY I synchrotron. The equipment was assessed at roughly USD 60 million in replacement value, but functioned only as an injector system: SESAME still required a new main storage ring to operate as a full synchrotron.
- As a standard practice for large technical donations, Berlin attached practical conditions. SESAME was required to pay for dismantling, full documentation, packing and international transport. The estimated cost for these services was about USD 600,000.
- That payment had a hard deadline: the guarantee had to be secured before the end of 1999 because the BESSY building had been promised to the Max Planck Society. These kinds of timelines are common when donor governments repurpose domestic facilities and must meet internal commitments.

### Emergency fundraising, constrained decision‑making and UNESCO’s role
- The German condition was disclosed to the SESAME leadership at short notice. Schopper (a leading SESAME advocate) learned of the requirement only a few hours before an Interim Council meeting, sharply limiting options for immediate fundraising and planning.
- Most delegates present lacked authority to sign multilateral financial commitments, so voluntary pleas at the meeting were ineffective as a legal/contractual response.
- After discussion, the U.S. State Department together with Sweden and Russia pledged USD 200,000. To close the USD 400,000 gap, Schopper turned to UNESCO: he asked Director‑General Koichiro Matsuura for the remainder, and Matsuura agreed following a personal meeting. UNESCO’s quick intervention exemplifies how multilateral agencies can act as agile intermediaries to bridge short‑term gaps in international science diplomacy.

### Technical gap and the larger capital requirement
- Even with BESSY’s injector components secured, SESAME still faced a major capital need: a new main ring was estimated at roughly USD 10 million. Donated subsystems can be invaluable, but they rarely eliminate the need for fresh investment in mission‑critical subsystems (here, the storage ring and its magnets).

### Formal European engagement and the feasibility review
- On 23 July 2001 a formal proposal—backed politically by German and French Ministers of Research and Commissioner Philippe Busquin—was submitted to European Commissioner Chris Patten.
- In October 2001 Anthony Cary (chef de cabinet to Patten) informed Schopper that the European Commission required an independent Techno‑Economic Feasibility Study performed by international experts before any institutional support could be contemplated.
- The feasibility study, led by Professor Guy Le Lay, reported that the project was scientifically promising and would stimulate research capacity and cooperation across the Middle East—precisely the type of regional science diplomacy outcomes that donors often cite in justifying support.

### EU institutional limits, energy trade‑offs and cost consequences
- Despite ministerial backing and a favourable feasibility report, Commissioner Patten stated in August 2003 that the European Commission could not provide Community funding to SESAME at that stage. This underlines how formal institutional rules and budgetary priorities can override bilateral ministerial enthusiasm.
- Subsequent technical discussions with the EU Commission raised objections about the machine’s target energy. Energy (measured in GeV) directly determines the range and quality of synchrotron radiation and therefore the kinds of experiments a facility can host. A political–technical compromise set an initial operating energy at 2.0 GeV with a planned upgrade path to 2.5 GeV.
- The compromise had cost implications: raising the ring energy to be more competitive would increase the main‑ring cost by about USD 2 million. These trade‑offs—capability versus cost—are ubiquitous in research infrastructure budgeting and often require explicit agreement among scientific planners and funders.

### Technical partnerships and later contributions
- Longer‑term relief came from technical partnership rather than straight grants. Negotiations initiated by SESAME’s Director General Rolf Heuer with European stakeholders (including discussions with EU Commissioner Carlos Moedas) produced approval for approximately USD 5 million for CERN to construct the main‑ring magnets. CERN’s involvement reduced technical risk, provided specialised expertise and transferred manufacturing responsibility to an established laboratory partner.
- Additional support continued to arrive piecemeal: for example, the Sergio Fubini Guesthouse at the SESAME site (inaugurated December 2019) was funded by the Italian government through its Ministry for Education, University and Research and INFN. Such later, often modest, bilateral contributions illustrate how facilities accrue infrastructure and capacity over long timelines.

### Analytical observations and lessons
- Mix of instruments: SESAME’s experience confirms that multinational scientific projects rarely rely on a single funding stream. Instead they combine in‑kind donations, bilateral contributions, emergency multilateral interventions (UNESCO), and technical partnerships (CERN) to close financing and capability gaps.
- Conditionality and timing: donor conditions—especially deadlines tied to domestic re‑use of facilities—can create acute short‑term pressures that require rapid diplomatic and financial responses. Institutional decision rules (who can legally pledge money) matter as much as goodwill.
- Technical specifications drive cost and politics: decisions about machine energy and upgrade paths are both scientific and political. Increasing capability to remain internationally competitive has direct, calculable cost consequences; these must be negotiated among scientists, funders and political authorities.
- The value of feasibility studies: independent Techno‑Economic Feasibility Studies play a dual role—assessing technical viability and legitimising projects to institutional funders. Even positive conclusions do not guarantee institutional funding, but they provide a necessary evidentiary basis for subsequent negotiations.
- Relevance for strategic actors (including India): SESAME’s trajectory shows how states and institutions can leverage scientific diplomacy to further regional cooperation, but also how fragile such projects are without diversified support. For policymakers concerned with national strategic culture, the case underscores the importance of combining technical planning, flexible diplomatic channels (including multilateral organisations), and contingency funding arrangements when promoting big‑science projects that have both scientific and geopolitical implications.

Conclusion: SESAME’s funding history is emblematic of large international science projects—a mosaic of generous in‑kind gifts, last‑minute fiscal crises, rapid multilateral rescue, rigorous independent appraisal and protracted negotiations over technical standards and financing. The project moved forward not through a single decisive grant but through layered commitments, technical partnerships and the steady accretion of institutional confidence over two decades.

### A Four‑Stage Model of Strategic Capability: An Analogue to Accelerator Architecture

Statement and analytic framing
- The plain descriptive claim “The machine works in four stages” functions as a top‑level model rather than a technical specification. In the context of strategic studies it is useful as an organising metaphor: complex strategic capabilities can be understood as systems that progress through distinct but interconnected phases.
- In the chapter that follows I adopt that schematic — drawing an explicit analogy to accelerator architecture (injector → booster → storage ring → beamlines) — to structure an analytic framework for India’s capability development and operational posture. This is an overview device intended to clarify relationships, interfaces and policy priorities; each stage requires its own technical, institutional and doctrinal elaboration.

Four stages and their strategic equivalents
1. Stage I — Source / Industrial Base (the “Injector”)
   - Description: The foundational scientific, industrial and human resources base that generates the raw inputs for strategic capabilities (materials, technologies, expertise). For India this comprises the defence R&D ecosystem (DRDO, ISRO, BARC), specialised industry (shipyards, ordnance factories, private high‑technology firms), and the education/training pipeline.
   - Key performance targets: indigenous production capacity, technology absorption rates, supply‑chain resilience, time-to‑prototype for new systems.
   - Distinct parameters: quality/availability of critical materials (propellants, nuclear material, composites), workforce skill levels, sustainment of specialised manufacturing lines.
   - Policy implications: export controls, industrial incentives, human capital development.

2. Stage II — Development and Force Modernisation (the “Booster”)
   - Description: The phase of accelerating capability — major programmes that transform industrial inputs into deployable systems (missiles, submarines, aircraft, C2 systems). This is India’s acquisition and modernisation engine.
   - Key performance targets: speed of fielding, technological maturity, interoperability, cost‑effectiveness.
   - Interface requirements: procurement regimes, testing ranges and schedules, joint technical standards and certification processes.
   - Doctrinal link: decisions about force-structure (numbers, types), deployment patterns and thresholds for operationalisation.

3. Stage III — Sustained Readiness and Force Maintenance (the “Storage Ring”)
   - Description: The maintenance of operationally credible forces over time — logistics, routine training, surveillance, survivability measures, and peacetime readiness cycles.
   - Key performance targets: survivability (hardened basing, mobility, concealment), reliability rates, sortie/launch rates, alert posture and crew proficiency.
   - Technical and institutional needs: preventive maintenance regimes, testing and diagnostics, reserve stocks and redundancies.
   - Governance: clear institutional responsibilities (e.g. Strategic Forces Command), transparent safety and safety‑culture norms to minimize accidents and escalation risks.

4. Stage IV — Employment, Deterrence Posture and Strategic Delivery (the “Beamlines”)
   - Description: The final delivery to the intended “user” — credible deterrent signalling, operational employment options, command‑and‑control and escalation management tools. Beamlines in an accelerator deliver usable photons to experiments; analogously, this stage delivers deterrent effects to audiences (adversaries, domestic polity, partners).
   - Key performance targets: timeliness and credibility of signalling, assured command authority, fail‑safe communications, options for proportional response.
   - Doctrine and credibility: clear declaratory policy, escalation ladders, and the ability to translate technical capability into strategic effect.

Critical interfaces and systems
- Physical/logistical interfaces (beam‑transfer analogues): transport/transfer corridors for weapons and platforms, secure supply chains, and basing arrangements that allow movement from production to operational status.
- Timing/synchronization: command, control and communications (C3) systems that ensure coordinated readiness and response across services and agencies — equivalent to accelerator timing systems that synchronise stages.
- Controls and institutions: legal frameworks, inter‑agency coordination mechanisms (Nuclear Command Authority, tri‑service boards), and export/import controls that regulate technology flow.
- Diagnostics and instrumentation: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and test/verification mechanisms to assess force health and adversary intent.

Failure modes and mitigations
- Failure to scale the industrial base → mitigations: targeted investment, public‑private partnerships, diversification of suppliers.
- Interface breakdowns (logistics, C3) → mitigations: redundant communications, distributed basing, joint exercises.
- Technological obsolescence or acquisition delays → mitigations: modular designs, fast prototyping, prioritized R&D.
- Safety/accident risk leading to political crisis → mitigations: rigorous safety culture, transparent accident investigation processes, legal safeguards.
- Escalation miscalculation due to poor signalling → mitigations: credible doctrine, clear declaratory policy and measured exercises to demonstrate capability without provocation.

Dependencies on critical infrastructure
- Energy and transport networks, secure manufacturing facilities, test ranges and maritime infrastructure.
- Cyber and electronic‑warfare resilience for modern C3.
- Skilled human capital: scientists, technicians,command personnel and institutional memory.
- International supply chains for niche components and dual‑use technologies — and the diplomatic capacity to manage sanctions/embargo risks.

Suggested next details for policy and design work
- For each stage provide: succinct description, concrete performance metrics (readiness rates, production throughput, deployment timelines), institutional owners, and budgetary/resource implications.
- Map stage‑to‑stage interfaces explicitly in programme planning documents (transfer timelines, handover protocols, contingency procedures).
- Conduct failure‑mode and escalation risk analyses per interface and incorporate them into commissioning and exercise planning.
- Integrate safety, legal and verification regimes into every stage rather than treating them as add‑ons.

Closing caveat
- This four‑stage model is analytic shorthand: it reveals the functional segmentation of strategic capability and highlights where policy choices, institutional design and technical investment must align. It is not a substitute for detailed programme‑level technical specifications or force‑planning, but it is a useful schema for organising strategy, budgeting and governance in India’s national security policy.

### The microtron injector: description, function and significance

A microtron is a compact, cyclic electron accelerator frequently employed as an injector for higher‑energy accelerator chains. In the facility under discussion the microtron performs two principal tasks: it accelerates electrons to a kinetic energy of 22.5 MeV, and it injects those electrons into a downstream booster synchrotron for further acceleration. The system became fully operational in November 2011, marking the completion of its commissioning phase and the start of routine beam delivery to the booster.

Technical note on energy and relativistic parameters
- The stated kinetic energy of the electrons is 22.5 MeV. Adding the electron rest mass (0.511 MeV) gives a total energy of ≈23.01 MeV, corresponding to a relativistic gamma factor γ ≈ 23.01/0.511 ≈ 45.0. This level of relativistic factor is typical for microtrons used as injectors: large enough to give a stable, relativistic beam but modest compared with storage‑ring energies.
- In brief operating principle, a microtron imparts energy incrementally to electrons each pass through an RF accelerating cavity while a magnetic field maintains a predictable, incrementally larger orbit radius. Its compact geometry and reliable energy gain per turn make it well suited to feed a booster.

Role in the accelerator chain
- Injection function: the microtron supplies a beam of known energy and phase space properties to the booster. The booster’s role is to accept that beam and accelerate it to the final operational energy required by a storage ring or other user facilities.
- The published injection energy (22.5 MeV) is consistent with the microtron’s role as a front‑end device: it provides a robust initial energy that simplifies beam capture and acceleration in the booster while keeping the injector footprint and complexity manageable.

Commissioning status and programmatic implications
- “Fully operational” (November 2011) indicates that commissioning and acceptance tests were complete and that the injector was available for routine use. For project management and users this milestone influences scheduling for downstream commissioning, user access allocation, and the ramp‑up of experimental programs.
- Operational date is also a useful datum for analyzing the timeline of the larger accelerator complex: it establishes when the accelerator chain began to dependably deliver beam and when associated research, isotope production or engineering tests could commence.

Important technical parameters not specified (and why they matter)
The brief description omits several metrics essential to understanding performance and utility:
- Beam current (average and peak): determines experiment throughput and photon / particle flux for applications.
- Repetition rate or pulse structure: affects time‑resolved experiments, injection matching and thermal loading.
- Emittance and energy spread: crucial for beam capture efficiency in the booster, emittance preservation, and final beam quality in user beamlines.
- Bunch charge and timing stability: matter for synchronization with RF systems and downstream experiments.
- Reliability/uptime and availability: determine operational cadence, user planning and facility return on investment.
Without these figures, assessment of the microtron’s performance for specific scientific, industrial or strategic applications remains incomplete.

Strategic and institutional significance (brief contextualisation)
Beyond the purely technical description, the commissioning of a microtron injector has broader implications for national science and security infrastructure:
- Capability building: reliable injector technology supports advanced materials research, accelerator‑based isotope production, and training of accelerator scientists and engineers — all elements of a resilient scientific base.
- Dual‑use potential: accelerator facilities underpin both civilian research and certain defence‑related R&D (materials testing, radiation effects, nondestructive evaluation). The existence of an operational injector thus contributes to a country’s technological autonomy and contingency capacity.
- Signalling: timely commissioning and routine operation demonstrate institutional competence in complex engineering projects and strengthen the credibility of national research infrastructure in international collaborations.

Concluding remark
The microtron’s role — accelerating electrons to 22.5 MeV and injecting them into the booster — is succinct but pivotal. The November 2011 operational milestone marked the transition from construction and testing to routine operation, enabling downstream accelerator activities. For a full appraisal of the facility’s scientific and strategic value, the omitted technical parameters (beam current, emittance, energy spread, repetition rate and operational availability) should be supplied and evaluated in relation to the booster and end‑user requirements.

### Case study: the booster synchrotron — technical role and strategic implications

The booster synchrotron provides a compact, instructive example of how high-technology research infrastructure simultaneously embodies technical function and strategic policy choices. Technically, institutionally and diplomatically, the booster links an upstream injector (the microtron), intermediate acceleration, and a downstream user facility (the storage ring). Politically and administratively, its provenance — assembled in part from components of the decommissioned German facility BESSY — highlights practical trade‑offs between cost, capability, sovereignty and international cooperation.

Technical function and immediate role
- System architecture and inputs
  - The booster synchrotron is a mid‑stage accelerator that receives electron bunches from a microtron, the upstream injector that produces initial low‑to‑moderate energy beams suitable for further acceleration.
- Acceleration objective
  - The booster’s primary function is to accelerate those electrons to an energy of approximately 800 MeV. This energy sets the operating regime of the downstream storage ring and thus helps determine the photon energies (and experimental modalities) available to users.
- Purpose in the experimental chain
  - Once accelerated, electrons are injected into the storage ring where they circulate and emit synchrotron radiation that supports a broad set of scientific and technological investigations.

Engineering integration and operational necessities
- Physical and systems integration
  - Reaching reliable 800 MeV operation requires careful attention to magnet alignment, radio‑frequency (RF) systems, vacuum integrity, power supply stability and beam diagnostics. Each subsystem must be calibrated to preserve beam emittance and timing for successful injection into the storage ring.
- Commissioning and ongoing operations
  - Commissioning entails staged testing, beam tuning and radiation‑safety validation before the facility supports external users. Thereafter, routine maintenance, spare‑parts provisioning and trained technical staff are essential to sustain uptime.
- Safety and regulatory compliance
  - Radiation protection, interlock systems and operational procedures must meet national regulatory standards; these requirements inform layout, staffing and emergency planning.

Reuse of BESSY components: technical and policy dimensions
- Hardware provenance and advantages
  - The booster was assembled using parts salvaged from BESSY, a respected German synchrotron decommissioned in 1999. Reusing proven hardware is cost‑effective, accelerates capability deployment and leverages mature technology.
- Technical challenges of reuse
  - Second‑hand components require refurbishment, compatibility adaptation (mechanical interfaces, controls and software), testing and possibly retrofitting to meet contemporary performance and safety expectations.
- Institutional implications
  - Acquisition of used components can foster technical learning — domestic engineers engage in deep refurbishment and systems integration work — but it also creates dependencies on legacy design documentation and, potentially, foreign expertise for troubleshooting.

Logistical, legal and diplomatic considerations
- Transfer and procurement issues
  - Moving decommissioned accelerator equipment internationally necessitates negotiated agreements, transport logistics for oversized and sensitive items, customs clearance and often export‑control compliance.
- Contracts and refurbishment arrangements
  - Legal instruments typically stipulate responsibilities for refurbishment, certification and liability; they can be structured to transfer knowledge through training clauses or to bind foreign firms to service contracts.
- Strategic and diplomatic affordances
  - Such transfers can be vehicles of scientific diplomacy, signaling cooperative ties with European institutions, while simultaneously inviting scrutiny over long‑term operational independence.

Strategic significance for national security and strategic culture
- Capability, autonomy and resilience
  - Building domestic accelerator capability, even partly from repurposed foreign parts, strengthens national technological capacity and human capital — assets relevant to both civilian R&D and dual‑use fields that touch national security (materials characterization, advanced manufacturing, medical isotopes).
- Trade‑offs and vulnerability
  - The cost savings of reused equipment must be balanced against potential vulnerabilities: reliance on foreign spare parts, legacy designs, and external refurbishment expertise can constrain operational resilience in contingency scenarios.
- Policy lessons
  - The booster example illustrates a pragmatic, hybrid approach common in strategic cultures that prioritize resource efficiency: leveraging international cooperation and second‑hand assets while investing in local integration skills, regulatory frameworks and supply‑chain diversification to safeguard strategic autonomy.

Concluding note
The booster synchrotron — its technical role, the integration of BESSY parts, and the attendant logistical and regulatory processes — serves as a microcosm of how scientific infrastructure intersects with strategic policy. Decisions about procurement, refurbishment and operation are simultaneously engineering choices and elements of a nation’s strategic posture: they build capability, shape dependencies and reflect broader priorities in research, diplomacy and security.

### Synchrotron Storage Rings: Function, Performance and Strategic Value

In assessing the scientific infrastructure component of national power, synchrotron light sources warrant specific attention. These facilities — centered on a storage ring that confines and circulates relativistic electrons — are indispensable for advanced materials characterization, sensor development and other capabilities with clear civil and defence applications. The following section summarizes the essential physics and engineering features of a representative 2.5 GeV storage ring, and outlines why those features matter for policy and security calculus.

#### Core function of the storage ring
- The storage ring’s primary function is to accelerate and confine electrons on a closed orbit so they circulate continuously. Confinement is achieved by a lattice of bending magnets and focusing magnets that maintain orbit stability and beam emittance.
- Circulating electrons are the source of synchrotron radiation: highly collimated, intense X‑ray (and lower‑energy) beams emitted as the electrons are forced to change direction.

#### Target energy and classification
- A 2.5 GeV electron energy places the facility in the medium‑energy class of synchrotron light sources. This energy regime is versatile:
  - It produces a broad spectral range spanning soft X‑rays through into some hard X‑ray energies.
  - It suits a wide array of experiments — from protein crystallography and surface science to small‑angle scattering and micro‑computed tomography — that underpin materials and forensic capabilities relevant to national security and industrial competitiveness.

#### Beam lifetime and operational implications
- The described system supports a beam lifetime on the order of up to two hours: that is, individual electron bunches can remain usefully circulating for roughly that duration before the stored current decays due to loss mechanisms.
- A finite lifetime has operational consequences:
  - Facilities commonly implement periodic injection or continuous “top‑up” injection to maintain a stable current and constant brightness. Top‑up preserves experimental conditions and maximizes useful X‑ray time, which is important for long exposures or time‑sensitive measurements.
  - Operational cadence and reliability therefore depend not only on the ring but on injector systems and control software — all elements with implications for resilience and security of critical national infrastructure.

#### Synchrotron radiation: where and how it is emitted
- Radiation is emitted tangentially from the electron trajectory at every bend and at insertion devices (undulators and wigglers) placed in straight sections.
- Insertion devices are engineered magnetic arrays that force periodic transverse motion of the electrons, producing extremely bright, quasi‑monochromatic beams (undulators) or broader high‑flux spectra (wigglers). The choice of device determines the spectral and coherence properties exploited by experiments.

#### Energy loss and RF energy recovery
- As electrons emit X‑rays they lose energy each time they complete a turn. Without replenishment, the beam energy and orbit would decay.
- Radio‑frequency (RF) cavities distributed along the ring supply accelerating electric fields synchronized to the electron bunches. These cavities restore the energy lost per turn, maintaining the design energy (2.5 GeV) and compensating for radiative losses.
- RF systems therefore are critical to sustaining beam energy, timing (phase stability) and overall brightness — any degradation in RF performance directly degrades experimental capability.

#### Engineering enablers: stability, vacuum and lattice design
- Achieving the stated energy and lifetime requires excellence in several technical domains:
  - Beam stability: active feedback systems mitigate orbit drift, tune shifts and collective instabilities that would reduce beam quality.
  - Ultra‑high vacuum: low residual gas pressure minimizes scattering and lifetime loss, extending the usable circulation time of electrons.
  - Magnet lattice design: precise arrangement and alignment of dipoles, quadrupoles and insertion devices controls emittance, beam size and the available beamlines for experiments.
- These systems together produce the continuous, stable X‑ray beam that experiments and downstream applications rely upon.

#### Strategic and policy considerations (brief)
- Synchrotron facilities are dual‑use scientific platforms: they power civilian research (materials, medicine, industry) while enabling defense‑relevant R&D (advanced alloys, non‑destructive inspection, electronics characterization, nuclear forensics).
- Policy implications include decisions about investment, operational security (physical and cyber), collaboration frameworks, and export controls for technologies and know‑how linked to these facilities.
- In strategic planning, the presence of a robust medium‑energy synchrotron enhances sovereignty in applied science, accelerates technology development, and shapes human capital — all elements that inform a nation’s broader security posture.

In sum, a 2.5 GeV storage ring with appropriate RF recovery, vacuum integrity, magnet lattice and injection strategy forms a compact but powerful scientific infrastructure. Its technical characteristics determine experimental reach and operational availability, while its existence and governance have tangible implications for national strategic capability.

## Beamlines, Capabilities and Strategic Significance

This short section outlines the planned beamlines fed by a storage-ring source, describes their scientific capabilities and operational characteristics, and situates those features within broader questions of strategic culture and national security policy. High-performance synchrotron facilities are not merely instruments of basic research; they are platforms for scientific diplomacy, regional capacity-building, and technological resilience. Understanding the technical make-up and commissioning trajectory of the facility’s beamlines therefore matters for any analysis of India’s — and the region’s — strategic posture in science and technology.

### From storage ring to experiment: the technical role of beamlines
A storage ring produces highly collimated, tunable X-ray photons; beamlines are the engineered conduits that convert that raw photon flux into experiment-ready probes. Each beamline comprises beam-conditioning optics (mirrors, focusing elements), monochromators to select photon energy, and instrument endstations with detectors and sample environments. Functionally, beamlines determine which measurements are possible (absorption fine structure, scattering patterns, tomographic reconstructions, etc.) and thus shape the scientific and applied outputs that a facility can deliver to users across disciplines.

### The seven planned beamlines (names, techniques, schedules)
The facility plans seven distinct beamlines that span environmental science, materials and biological research, and imaging. Three were designated as "day‑one" priority instruments intended to be available during the facility’s initial operations; others were scheduled later or left without firm dates.

- BASEMA — Beamline for Absorption Spectroscopy for Environmental and Material Applications  
  - Technique: X‑ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) and X‑ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy.  
  - Planned status: "day‑one" beamline; provisional readiness March–April 2017.  
  - Role: Optimized for elemental and speciation analysis in environmental and materials studies (pollution tracing, catalyst characterization, mineralogy).

- EMIRA — ElectroMagnetic Infrared RAdiation  
  - Technique: Infrared (IR) spectromicroscopy.  
  - Planned status: "day‑one" beamline; start of operations April–May 2017.  
  - Role: Chemical mapping and molecular identification at micrometre scales — important for polymers, cultural heritage and biological tissues.

- SUSAM — SESAME USers Application for Materials Science (Materials Science)  
  - Technique: Broad materials‑science capability (diffraction, scattering, spectroscopies inferred).  
  - Planned status: Targeted completion at end of Q3 2017.  
  - Role: Structural, electronic and microstructural studies of advanced and functional materials.

- MX — Macromolecular Crystallography  
  - Technique: X‑ray crystallography for biological macromolecules.  
  - Planned status: Scheduled for completion in 2019.  
  - Role: Protein/DNA structure determination with direct applications to biomedicine and drug discovery.

- Soft X‑ray beamline  
  - Technique: Soft X‑ray spectroscopy and imaging.  
  - Planned status: Date not specified.  
  - Role: Surface/interface and electronic‑structure investigations of light elements and thin films.

- SAXS/WAXS — Small Angle and Wide Angle X‑ray Scattering  
  - Technique: Scattering for nanoscale and mesoscale structural characterization.  
  - Planned status: Date not specified.  
  - Role: Studies of polymers, colloids, biological assemblies and nanomaterials.

- Tomography beamline  
  - Technique: X‑ray computed tomography (3‑D imaging).  
  - Planned status: Date not specified.  
  - Role: Non‑destructive internal imaging for materials science, paleontology, cultural heritage and biomedical samples.

These beamlines collectively support multidisciplinary applications spanning environment, materials, biology, cultural heritage and medicine.

### Operational and project realities
Several practical points about commissioning and operation are salient for strategic analysis:

- "Day‑one" instruments are prioritized to enable immediate user access and demonstrate operational capability; their readiness is mission‑critical for building user communities and attracting international collaborations.
- Commissioning timelines are provisional. Delivery depends on installation, optical alignment, calibration, staff training and often complex international procurement and in‑kind contributions.
- Beamline projects are typically collaborative undertakings involving member states, instrument teams, and funders; in‑kind contributions (hardware, human expertise) are common.
- Operational needs extend beyond hardware: clear user‑access policies, transparent beamtime allocation, training programmes for regional scientists, spare‑parts logistics, and maintenance regimes are prerequisites for sustained scientific service.
- Typical scientific outputs from these beamlines include elemental speciation maps, molecular imaging, macromolecular structures, scattering profiles characterizing nanoscale order, and high‑resolution three‑dimensional reconstructions.

### Strategic implications for India and the region
For scholars of strategic culture and national security policy, such scientific infrastructure merits attention for several reasons:

- Scientific diplomacy and regional engagement: Facilities that host multinational user bases serve as nodes for cross‑border cooperation and trust‑building. Supporting or participating in regional beamline projects can be an instrument of soft power for India, fostering networks of scientists and institutions across neighbouring states.
- Capacity building and talent retention: Access to advanced instruments enables training of young researchers, reduces scientific brain‑drain, and builds domestic competence in materials, health and environmental sciences — capabilities relevant to economic resilience and technological autonomy.
- Dual‑use awareness and governance: High‑end research tools can have civil and military applications; governance measures (export controls, user vetting, transparency in research objectives) are therefore relevant to national security policy.
- Societal and cultural payoff: Beamlines serving cultural‑heritage analysis or biomedical research produce tangible societal benefits that strengthen public support for science and broaden the strategic value of investment.
- Contingency and resilience: Reliance on international supply chains for specialized optical components and detectors underscores the need for maintenance planning, spare‑parts strategies, and regional cooperative arrangements to ensure operational continuity during geopolitical disruption.

Conclusion: the technical specifics of the seven planned beamlines — their scientific capabilities, commissioning schedule and collaborative construction — are not merely operational detail. They are the material expression of a regional scientific enterprise with strategic payoffs: enabling applied research relevant to public health, natural resources and industry; building regional networks; and creating levers for soft power and technological resilience that matter to India’s strategic culture and national security calculus.

## Case study: Regional Synchrotron Infrastructure — technical profile and strategic implications

This short case study examines a regional synchrotron facility whose physical and operational profile at opening (2017) illustrates wider themes relevant to scientific infrastructure, regional cooperation and national security policy. The facility in question was built with capacity for seven independent beamlines but was inaugurated with only two operational beamlines; further beamlines were to be added in phases (the third, an X‑ray crystallography beamline, was scheduled for late 2017). Although modest in scale at opening, the facility’s early experimental portfolio—an X‑ray beam for environmental monitoring and an infrared (IR) microscopy beam for biomedical tissue studies—highlights how synchrotron infrastructure can serve both civilian research priorities and strategic national interests.

Technical and operational profile
- Physical capacity and staged deployment
  - The facility is designed to host seven beamlines—i.e., seven separate experimental stations fed by the synchrotron light source. This fixed physical capacity establishes the long‑term scientific throughput potential.
  - At the 2017 opening only two beamlines were operational, with the remaining lines planned for later commissioning. The third beamline, an X‑ray source optimized for crystallography, was slated for late‑2017 commissioning.
  - Phased commissioning is a common approach: it reduces upfront capital expenditure, allows progressive recruitment and training of specialized staff, and provides time for technical commissioning, calibration and troubleshooting of complex beamline instrumentation.

- The two initial operational beamlines and their scientific uses
  - X‑ray beamline (first operational): configured to study air pollution in the adjacent Jordan Valley and other materials‑analysis applications. X‑ray beamlines typically enable:
    - High‑resolution imaging and tomography of materials,
    - Elemental and phase analysis (X‑ray fluorescence, diffraction),
    - Structural studies of industrial materials, environmental samples and geological specimens.
    These techniques support environmental monitoring (e.g., particulate composition), materials quality assurance and basic materials research.
  - Infrared (IR) beamline with microscope (second operational): used for molecular and chemical imaging of biological tissues, including cancer cell studies. IR beamlines are particularly valuable for:
    - Label‑free molecular mapping of tissues,
    - Chemical characterization of biomolecules and pathological samples,
    - Correlative studies that complement histopathology and other imaging modalities.
    Biomedical IR capabilities are important for translational research into diagnostics and treatment evaluation.

- Planned crystallography beamline (third)
  - The planned X‑ray crystallography beamline would enable atomic‑scale structural determination of crystals and biomolecules. Crystallography is central to:
    - Determining protein and small‑molecule structures for drug discovery,
    - Developing novel materials with tailored properties,
    - Supporting biotechnology and pharmaceutical research.
  - A crystallography line thus amplifies the facility’s relevance to health, industrial innovation and applied research.

Supporting infrastructure and human capital
- Operational beamlines require more than the storage ring and optics.
  - Essential supporting systems include high‑performance detectors, sample‑environment chambers (temperature, pressure, humidity, cryo‑systems), robust data acquisition hardware and software, and high‑capacity data processing pipelines.
  - Effective operation also depends on trained beamline scientists, engineers, technicians and data scientists to run experiments, maintain equipment, and curate large datasets.
- Capacity building
  - Regional synchrotrons frequently incorporate training programs, visiting‑scientist schemes and collaborative projects to develop local expertise. This human capital is a strategic asset that sustains scientific activity and underpins national S&T capabilities.

Research priorities and regional relevance
- Environmental and health research
  - The initial focus areas—pollution monitoring and biomedical tissue analysis—reflect immediate regional priorities: environmental security (air quality, water and soil contaminants) and public health (cancer and other diseases).
  - Such applied research has direct societal benefits and can inform policy, emergency response and public‑health interventions.
- Broader research value
  - Beyond the opening portfolio, beamlines (particularly a crystallography capability) enable contributions to drug discovery, materials science, and industrial R&D—fields with economic and strategic significance.

Strategic and policy implications for national security and diplomacy
- Science and technology as strategic infrastructure
  - Synchrotron facilities are high‑value scientific infrastructure that bolster a country’s technological independence and innovation capacity. For states seeking strategic resilience, domestic or regional access to such infrastructure reduces reliance on foreign facilities for critical research.
- Soft power and regional influence
  - Hosting a regional facility can be an instrument of scientific diplomacy: it draws collaborations, trains scientists from neighboring countries, and projects soft power through shared access and capacity building.
- Dual‑use considerations and governance
  - Advanced analytic capabilities carry potential dual‑use risks (e.g., biochemical agent analysis, dual‑use materials research). Effective governance—access rules, export controls, biosecurity protocols and data‑sharing policies—is essential to balance openness with national security.
- Data security and intellectual property
  - Large experimental datasets and structural determination results can have commercial and strategic value. Policies governing data ownership, publication, and technology transfer should align with national security and economic objectives.
- Operational sustainability and risk management
  - Phased commissioning and staged staffing reduce financial risk but require sustained funding to complete planned beamlines, retain skilled staff and maintain instrumentation. Timelines (for example, “late 2017” commissioning targets) are vulnerable to technical, funding or staffing delays; sustained political and budgetary support is therefore critical.

Practical recommendations for policymakers (relevance to India)
- Monitor progress and outcomes: track commissioning milestones and published research to assess return on investment and strategic value.
- Invest in human capital: prioritize training programs, fellowships and technician apprenticeships to build domestic expertise.
- Align facility mission with national priorities: ensure planned capabilities (e.g., crystallography) serve public‑health, materials and industrial innovation goals tied to economic and security interests.
- Develop governance frameworks: establish clear access, biosecurity and data policies that balance openness for scientific collaboration with safeguards for national security and intellectual property.
- Use regional engagement strategically: leverage shared facilities for scientific diplomacy while protecting sensitive capabilities and knowledge.

Conclusion
A synchrotron facility that opens with two operational beamlines but a physical capacity for seven illustrates the interplay between technical staging and strategic ambition. The initial X‑ray and IR capabilities established immediate utility for environmental monitoring and biomedical research; the planned crystallography line would further extend strategic value into drug discovery and materials science. For national security planners and strategists—India included—such infrastructure is more than a scientific asset: it is a lever of technological autonomy, regional influence and policy‑relevant research. Realizing that potential requires attention to phased commissioning, supporting infrastructure and personnel, governance of dual‑use risks, and sustained funding and diplomatic strategy.

### Case study: Security and infrastructure shocks at SESAME — implications for international scientific cooperation

Summary of incidents
- Two Iranian scientists associated with SESAME — Dr. Masoud Alimohammadi and Dr. Majid (Magid) Shahriari — were killed in separate targeted attacks. Iranian authorities publicly attributed responsibility to external intelligence services; in 2010 an Iranian prosecutor accused Mossad of involvement. Such accusations were politically charged and contested; an accusation is not identical to established judicial proof.
- In 2013, a severe regional cold snap and heavy snowfall caused a laboratory roof collapse at the SESAME site. The structural failure produced material damage and programmatic delays, slowing commissioning and research activities.

Why these incidents matter for international organisations like SESAME
- SESAME is explicitly both a scientific and diplomatic project: a synchrotron facility designed to enable advanced research while building cross-border cooperation among Middle Eastern states, including Iran. The facility’s value thus rests on two fragile pillars — technical infrastructure and interpersonal/political trust among members.
- Security incidents that target personnel (or are perceived to) directly erode trust among participating states. When scientists are killed under politically charged circumstances, the immediate human cost is compounded by longer-term effects: reduced mobility of researchers, reluctance to share data or collaborate freely, and potential declines in member-state engagement or funding.
- Physical damage from infrastructure failure—especially where caused by exceptional weather—raises separate but related concerns about design standards, climate resilience, and continuity planning. Delays driven by structural damage increase costs, prolong timelines, and can weaken donor and partner confidence.

Broader implications for scientific diplomacy and multilateral projects
- Targeted violence has strategic as well as operational consequences. Loss of personnel represents erosion of human capital that is difficult to replace; the chilling effect can be systemic, discouraging both the affected country’s scientists and external partners from active engagement.
- Political attribution of violence (even when unproven) shifts an ostensibly neutral scientific space into a contested security arena. Member states may react by demanding stronger host-state protections, invoking sovereign countermeasures, or withdrawing personnel — all of which undermine the neutral, collaborative character essential to science diplomacy.
- Infrastructure vulnerabilities exposed by extreme weather underline a governance gap: many internationally funded facilities are designed to normative historic loadings rather than the expanding range of climatic extremes. This gap invites programmatic risk (delays, budget overruns) and reputational risk (questions about management competence).

Risk mitigation and good-practice responses
- Security measures proportional to the threat environment: secure transport and lodgings for visiting scientists, vetted access control, incident-reporting systems, and liaison protocols with member-state security services while preserving scientific autonomy.
- Insurance and financial contingency planning: explicit budget lines for disaster recovery, business-continuity funds, and contractual clauses with donors and suppliers that address force majeure and political-risk eventualities.
- Structural resilience and climate-proofing: engineering reviews that account for rare but possible weather loads, regular maintenance regimes, and investment in redundant systems to prevent single points of failure.
- Transparent investigation and documentation: independent, credible inquiries into both violent incidents and infrastructure failures. Transparent findings are crucial to restoring confidence among international partners and preventing politicised narratives from undermining cooperation.
- Crisis communications and trust-rebuilding: coordinated, neutral public messaging and procedural guarantees (e.g., third-party monitoring) that reassure members about safety and impartiality without exacerbating interstate tensions.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s strategic culture emphasises strategic autonomy, pragmatism in external engagements, and a historically strong preference for multilateral technical cooperation (IT, space, nuclear energy, and academic exchanges). The SESAME case offers cautionary lessons for Indian participation in, or leadership of, multilateral scientific initiatives:
  - Protecting nationals and expertise abroad: India must integrate non-traditional threats (targeted violence, politicised security environments) into protocols for scientists deployed in contentious regions. This requires inter-ministerial coordination — foreign affairs, home/internal security, and science ministries — plus clear standard operating procedures.
  - Designing resilient cooperative frameworks: Indian policy should favour institutional mechanisms that shield scientific collaboration from geopolitical spillover — e.g., neutral governance structures, third-party investigative mechanisms, and binding security arrangements among members.
  - Incorporating political risk into project management: when India funds, hosts, or partners on large-scale science infrastructure, project appraisal should explicitly include political-security risk assessments and contingency budgeting.
  - Leveraging science diplomacy while safeguarding strategic interests: active engagement in regional or global facilities can advance India’s soft power, but sustained engagement requires balancing openness with protective measures for personnel and infrastructure.

Conclusion: maintaining science as a neutral space requires active defence
SESAME’s experience illustrates how scientific endeavours that double as diplomatic spaces are uniquely vulnerable to both security incidents and environmental shocks. For India — and for any state committed to multilateral scientific engagement — the lesson is practical and strategic: preserve the neutrality and utility of international scientific forums by institutionalising security, resilience, transparency, and contingency planning. Doing so protects human capital, sustains collaboration, and upholds the broader foreign-policy dividends of science diplomacy even in contested geopolitical environments.
