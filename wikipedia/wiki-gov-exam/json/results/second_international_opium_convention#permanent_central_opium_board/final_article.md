### The 1925 Geneva Opium Convention (Second International Opium Convention)

Background and context  
The Second International Opium Convention, commonly known as the 1925 Geneva Opium Convention, was signed in Geneva in 1925 as a successor to the 1912 Hague Opium Convention. The 1912 treaty had been the first comprehensive multilateral attempt to regulate narcotic substances; the 1925 Convention revised and tightened that framework within the interwar multilateral architecture of the League of Nations. The treaty must be read both as a continuation of an emergent international drug-control regime and as an early instance of the transfer of regulatory authority from exclusively national settings to standardized international mechanisms.

Core substantive provisions  
- Name and locus: Officially the Second International Opium Convention, signed at Geneva (1925).  
- Substantive scope: The Convention narrowed and specified legal measures for classical opium derivatives—opium itself, morphine and cocaine—clarifying obligations that states had already begun to accept after 1912. Crucially, it extended international controls to include certain preparations of cannabis: extracts and tinctures were brought within the treaty’s ambit. This represented an important, if narrow, widening of the categories of controlled substances beyond opium derivatives to include concentrated, marketable cannabis preparations rather than the entire plant in all its traditional uses.

Institutional innovation: statistical controls and the Permanent Central Opium Board  
One of the Convention’s most significant innovations was the creation of a statistical control system requiring states to collect and report standardized data on production, manufacture, trade and stocks of relevant narcotic substances. To supervise this system the treaty established the Permanent Central Opium Board (PCOB). The Board occupied a hybrid institutional position: functionally independent and charged with technical monitoring and verification, yet institutionally linked to the League of Nations framework. The PCOB marked the first sustained attempt to erect a permanent, supranational organ tasked with oversight and transparency in a policy area that had previously been left largely to domestic authorities.

Why these measures mattered: transparency, standardization, enforcement  
The statistical reporting regime reduced information asymmetries among states, improved the capacity to detect diversion and illicit traffic, and created a basis for cooperative enforcement. By standardizing what and how states reported, the Convention made regulatory expectations more uniform, thereby strengthening the enforceability of international norms in a domain—narcotics trade—characterized by cross-border movement and commercial complexity. The PCOB’s role as a technical monitor also anticipated later uses of independent expert bodies to underpin treaty compliance.

Significance and legacy in the international drug-control architecture  
The 1925 Convention consolidated an evolution from ad hoc, nationally centered measures toward centralized, bureaucratic international governance of drugs. The PCOB is properly viewed as an institutional precursor to the post‑World War II and United Nations–era organs (eventually culminating in entities such as the International Narcotics Control Board). The Convention’s selective expansion to cannabis extracts—targeting concentrated, commercially viable preparations rather than the whole plant—reveals an early regulatory logic oriented toward controlling the most marketable and harm-prone forms of substances.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
The Convention’s dynamics have direct resonance for an analysis of Indian strategic culture and national security policy for several reasons:  
- Colonial context and practical impact: In 1925 India was still under British rule and was a significant producer and exporter of opium. Colonial regulatory practices and economic interests shaped how controls were implemented on the subcontinent. The Convention thus interacted with colonial administrative capacities and economic imperatives, producing regulatory constraints that would carry into the post‑colonial period.  
- State control and sovereignty trade-offs: The move toward centralized monitoring exemplified by the PCOB reflects a recurring tension in Indian strategic culture—between sovereignty and the acceptance of multilateral institutions to manage transnational threats. India’s subsequent positions in international drug-control negotiations often balanced concerns about national prerogatives, public-health priorities, and international obligations.  
- Enduring security concerns: Narcotics regulation impinges on law-and-order, public health, cross‑border crime and insurgency financing—core elements of national security. The 1925 Convention’s emphasis on standardized reporting and international oversight foreshadowed policy tools India would later have to deploy to confront trafficking networks and transnational criminality that affect internal stability.  
- Institutional precedent: The PCOB’s model—an independent technical organ linked to a political multilateral body—offers a template India has engaged with repeatedly: preferring expert, legally circumscribed institutions for technically complex issues while guarding political decision-making within sovereign forums.

Concise synthesis  
The 1925 Geneva Opium Convention is a compact but pivotal episode in the internationalization of drug control. It strengthened substantive controls on opium derivatives, extended regulation to concentrated cannabis preparations, and—through the creation of a statistical regime supervised by the Permanent Central Opium Board—established enduring institutional forms for monitoring and cooperation. For India, both as a major historical node in the colonial opium economy and later as an independent state confronting trafficking and public-health challenges, the Convention exemplifies how multilateral norms, technical institutions and sovereignty concerns intersect within strategic practice and national-security policymaking.

### History

The Second International Opium Convention (commonly dated 1925) occupies a pivotal place in the formation of the early international narcotics-control regime. It is best understood as both a technical response to specific flaws in earlier treaties and as a diplomatic product of the League of Nations-era architecture that shaped inter‑war international law and state practice.

- Origins: the Hague framework (1912 → post‑war entry into force)  
  The movement toward multilateral narcotics control began well before Geneva. The First International Opium Conference at The Hague in 1912 produced the First International Opium Convention, establishing the first multilateral attempt to regulate opium and other narcotics. Because of World War I, many of the Hague instruments did not achieve universal application immediately. At the Paris Peace Conference after the war, political settlement mechanisms were used to bring the Hague Opium Convention into wider force (an outcome of the post‑war reordering and the League’s efforts to regularize treaty obligations).

- Why a second instrument? Shortcomings of the Hague Convention  
  Experience with the Hague Convention revealed important gaps: enforcement weaknesses, ambiguities about which substances and activities should be controlled, and insufficient mechanisms for international cooperation on manufacture, trade and diversion. These shortcomings generated diplomatic momentum for supplementary measures that could close loopholes and strengthen supranational oversight.

- Two instruments at Geneva, 1925: Convention and Protocol  
  In 1925 two distinct instruments were negotiated in Geneva to address those gaps: the Second Opium Convention and an accompanying Opium Protocol. Both were the product of the League of Nations’ treaty‑making machinery and of sustained multilateral negotiation among producing, transit and importing states. The two texts were negotiated contemporaneously and concluded in Geneva in February 1925, but they were carefully drafted with different scopes in mind: the Convention set broader obligations and structures, while the Protocol specified particular measures (a pattern frequently used in multilateral law where “convention” and “protocol” carry different legal and functional connotations).

- Geneva setting and formalities (Palais Wilson → Room F, 19 February 1925)  
  The negotiations and signature took place at the League’s Geneva headquarters (then commonly referred to as the Palais Wilson, or in League documents as the Palais des Nations). The final text of the Convention was signed in Room F—the so‑called “Orange Room”—on 19 February 1925. Although signature and adoption occurred then, as with many multilateral treaties of the period, formal entry into force depended on subsequent ratifications by states.

- Separate instruments, separate scopes; a Brussels treaty in parallel  
  Although the 1925 Convention and Protocol were negotiated together, they did not overlap legally; each had a distinct regulatory purpose. In addition, a separate treaty adopted a few months later in Brussels (also in 1925) addressed related drug‑control questions. That Brussels agreement influenced policy and practice but was not legally identical to, nor did it directly duplicate, the Geneva texts. Using separate treaties to address related aspects of a complex problem—trade, manufacture, distribution and specific substances—was a common diplomatic approach designed to secure broader political agreement while tailoring obligations to different issues.

- Entry into force and registration (25 September 1928)  
  After the necessary ratifications, the Second International Opium Convention entered into force on 25 September 1928. It was registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on the same day, a procedural act that signaled formal international recognition and made the text publicly available—an early practice of treaty transparency that the League promoted.

- The 1925 instruments in the architecture of narcotics control  
  The Convention and Protocol of 1925 became foundational elements of the emergent international narcotics‑control system under the League of Nations. Their institutional and substantive designs—controls on manufacture and trade, reporting and statistical requirements, and mechanisms for international cooperation—served as precedents for later post‑World War II arrangements. Ultimately, these early instruments fed into the consolidation of global drug control law that culminated in the United Nations’ post‑war conventions, most notably the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.

- Practical and political implications for India’s strategic culture and security policy  
  Any study of international drug control in the early twentieth century must take colonial India into account. British India had been a major site of opium production and trade in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; opium revenues, administrative arrangements for cultivation and sale, and imperial trade networks made narcotics policy a matter of colonial governance as well as commerce. The 1925 Geneva instruments, negotiated in an era when colonies were represented by imperial governments, constrained and reshaped how producing territories were regulated. For India (and, later, independent India), these treaties fed into a layered experience: as a producer and exporter under colonial rule, and subsequently as a sovereign state that inherited obligations, institutional practices, and international expectations about narcotics control. Thus the Geneva agreements are relevant to India’s strategic culture in several respects:
  - They illustrate how international regimes can intersect with domestic revenue systems and administrative practices—issues that inform state calculations about economic security and governance capacity.  
  - They show how multilateral legal norms can be internalized into national policing, public‑health, and customs practices, contributing to an evolving state capacity that later underpinned independent India’s own drug‑control policy.  
  - They exemplify how diplomatic negotiations over ostensibly technical matters (definitions, scope, reporting) carry strategic consequences for producing and transit states, influencing bargaining behavior and postures toward international institutions.

- Concluding observation: law, diplomacy and security in the inter‑war narcotics regime  
  The Second International Opium Convention of 1925 is therefore more than a niche legal instrument: it is a case study in how inter‑war multilateral diplomacy attempted to govern a transnational economic and public‑health problem, how treaty form (convention versus protocol) was used tactically, and how the interplay of colonial interests and international law produced enduring regulatory architectures. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the 1925 instruments offer an instructive example of how international norms and institution‑building can shape state behavior, administrative capacity, and the securitization of social and economic issues across regimes of sovereignty.

### 4.x From the Permanent Central Opium Board to the INCB: Institutional Evolution and Implications for India

Background and creation
- The international institutional response to narcotics control began to take institutional, treaty-based form with the 1925 International Opium Convention. That treaty established the Permanent Central Opium Board (PCOB), which was formally set up to translate the new multilateral commitments into routine supervisory activity. Although the Convention was concluded in 1925, the PCOB only commenced operations in 1928—reflecting the slow administrative mobilisation characteristic of early multilateral governance.

Mandate and functions of the PCOB
- The PCOB’s core tasks were technical and supervisory: monitoring state compliance with treaty obligations; reviewing and verifying state “estimates” of legitimate narcotics needs (to prevent diversion into illicit markets); and collecting and circulating statistics on production, manufacture and international trade in opiates. These functions established norms and procedures—reporting formats, verification practices and statistical standards—that would prove durable across institutional reforms.

Legal independence vs. administrative integration
- Legally, the PCOB was an autonomous organ created by treaty. In practice, however, it became partially integrated into the institutional architecture of the League of Nations. The League’s secretariat provided administrative support and a venue for political coordination, which aided the Board’s effectiveness but also exposed it to political pressures and perceptions of diminished independence. This duality—formal independence coupled with practical administrative embedding—illustrates how early international regulatory bodies balanced sovereignty concerns against the need for bureaucratic capacity.

Nomenclature and institutional proliferation
- Over time the Board’s designation shifted in response to changing substantive scope and political usage: it appears variously as the Permanent Central Opium Board, the Permanent Central Narcotics Board, and, in shorthand, the Permanent Central Board. These name changes signalled an incremental broadening of the control agenda from a single commodity (opium) toward a wider range of narcotics.

1931 Limitation Convention and the Drug Supervisory Body
- The 1931 Limitation Convention marked a qualitative shift: it introduced mechanisms aimed at limiting production and instituted a separate organ—the Drug Supervisory Body (Organe de Contrôle)—to supervise raw-material controls and production quotas. The coexistence of the PCOB and the Drug Supervisory Body reflected a growing technical complexity (statistics and estimates vs. quotas and material control) and a tendency toward functional specialisation within international drug governance.

Consolidation under UN auspices: the 1961 Single Convention and the INCB
- The mid-twentieth century witnessed institutional consolidation. The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provided a new, integrated legal framework that subsumed earlier single-drug instruments into a comprehensive regime. In 1968 the functions of the PCOB and the Drug Supervisory Body were merged into the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). The INCB combined the supervisory, statistical and quota functions of its predecessors and became the primary independent control organ under the UN system.

Contemporary core tasks of the INCB
- In its post‑1968 form the INCB emphasises three central tasks:
  1. Monitoring implementation of the international drug control treaties (compliance and reporting);
  2. Ensuring adequate availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes (balancing control with access);
  3. Preventing diversion into illicit channels (through verification of estimates, licenses, and international cooperation).
- These tasks mirror and extend the functional responsibilities first exercised by the PCOB and the Drug Supervisory Body.

A longer trajectory: from single-drug treaties to integrated multilateral regimes
- The evolutionary arc from the 1925 Convention and the PCOB through the 1931 Limitation Convention to the 1961 Single Convention and the INCB exemplifies a broader trend in international regulation: movement from several fragmented, commodity-specific treaties toward integrated, institutionally consolidated multilateral regimes under UN auspices. The process combined legal codification, technical standardisation and centralised oversight—qualities prized by states seeking predictability in an interdependent global drug market.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Historical legacy: India’s experience is distinctive. Under colonial rule, India was a major site of opium cultivation and trade; international controls shaped colonial fiscal policy, rural agrarian choices and metropolitan political debates. The institutionalisation of opium control therefore touched upon economic interests and imperial governance, imprinting a sceptical pragmatism in Indian attitudes toward external regulation.
- Post-colonial posture: after independence, India navigated international drug regimes with a dual logic—cooperation for global legitimacy and caution to protect domestic public health and development needs. India became a participant in the evolving multilateral framework, but its positions often reflected concerns about medical availability, rural livelihoods and technical capacity to implement stringent controls.
- Security and governance effects: the institutional mechanisms (estimates verification, statistics, quotas) influenced India’s internal security priorities—counter‑trafficking law enforcement, border controls (with porous frontiers), and patient access to opioids for pain management. The INCB’s emphasis on both preventing diversion and ensuring medical availability encapsulates recurring policy trade-offs for India: robust enforcement to deny revenue streams to criminal networks versus guaranteeing access for legitimate medical use.
- Institutional lessons: the PCOB’s partial integration into the League foreshadowed a perennial tension for Indian policymakers in multilateral institutions—reconciling sovereignty and administrative dependence. Engagement with the INCB and the UN system offered India technical support and normative authority, but also required navigating instances where international administrative frameworks can shape domestic policy choices.
- Strategic takeaways: the history of international narcotics control demonstrates for India the importance of technical capacity (statistics, regulatory licensing systems), diplomatic engagement to shape treaty norms, and domestic institutional resilience to implement multilateral obligations without compromising national development and public-health priorities.

Concluding remark
- The institutional lineage from the PCOB to the INCB is not merely a bureaucratic succession; it maps a substantive shift in how states collectively regulate potentially destabilising goods. For India, that lineage intersects with colonial history, development concerns and contemporary security challenges—making narcotics governance a revealing case of how international institutions influence national strategic choices.

### International Control of Cannabis (Indian Hemp): 1920s–1939 — Negotiation, Compromise, and Strategic Implications for India

Background and context
- In the interwar period the international drug control regime — building on earlier opium conventions — turned attention from opiates to other substances associated with recreational use. “Indian hemp” (an older legal and diplomatic term encompassing Cannabis sativa and its preparations) and, in particular, resinous concentrates (charas, hashish, chira, esrar, diamba, etc.) became the focus of growing concern among several States.
- The proposals and debates of this era must be read against colonial governance structures, differing cultural practices regarding cannabis use, and limited administrative and enforcement capacities in many parts of the globe. These structural conditions shaped both state positions and the eventual legal architecture.

Draft proposals and the sub‑committee text
- Backed politically by Egypt (which framed the issue as a public‑health and social order concern), with Italy and South Africa among its supporters, a drafting sub‑committee recommended extending international control beyond opium and cocaine to include hashish and related cannabis products.
- The sub‑committee’s draft was stringent: it sought to restrict Indian hemp and its preparations to strictly medical and scientific purposes. Crucially, the draft characterized raw resin and concentrated preparations as non‑medical and harmful, and it proposed a total ban on their production, sale, and international trade.

India’s objections and the reasons behind them
- India, along with other States, formally objected to the proposed total ban. The objections rested on several grounds:
  - Social and religious customs: cannabis use was embedded in many social and ritual practices across the Indian subcontinent. Blanket criminalization risked profound social disruption and affronted local cultural norms.
  - Practical enforcement difficulties: wild and widely dispersed cannabis growth in many regions made eradication, monitoring, and enforcement highly impractical given existing administrative resources.
  - Colonial governance complexity: India’s position reflected the tensions of colonial rule — metropolitan treaty obligations on one hand, and the need to manage local customs and stability on the other.
- These objections were not solely parochial resistance to international oversight; they highlighted real implementation limits and potential unintended consequences of a sweeping ban.

Compromise solution: certificates, export prohibitions, and import controls
- The negotiations produced a compromise that balanced international restrictions on cross‑border trafficking with substantial domestic leeway for States:
  - Export prohibition: States were to prohibit the export of “Indian hemp” to countries that had themselves enacted a domestic ban. This effectively prevented legal trade into prohibiting jurisdictions while not criminalizing producer States per se.
  - Certificate system: exporting countries had to issue certificates approving shipments and attesting that consignments were destined exclusively for medical or scientific purposes. Importing countries, in turn, had to confirm receipt and use for such purposes. This certificate mechanism mirrored earlier controls used for opiates and sought to regulate the legal medical trade.
  - Obligation to exercise effective control: Parties to the convention were required to exercise effective control to prevent illicit international trafficking in Indian hemp, with special emphasis on resinous preparations.
- Importantly, the convention’s practical design left considerable room for domestic policy variation: production, internal distribution, and non‑international uses could remain subject to national law, and many States continued to permit internal recreational use.

Legal drafting, concentration thresholds, and regulatory loopholes
- The original treaty language created a technical distinction based on the form and concentration of cannabis preparations:
  - Controls were initially focused on pure cannabis extracts and tinctures at full (100%) strength — essentially designating concentrated preparations as subject to the instrument.
  - Medicines that contained cannabis but in diluted form (even with very high ratios of diluent to extract — e.g., 99:1) fell outside the strict letter of the control and thus escaped international restriction.
- This concentration‑based distinction created a notable legal loophole: many pharmaceutical preparations and mixed products containing cannabis could lawfully circulate without triggering treaty obligations. Such drafting choices reflected both negotiating compromise and limited pharmacological standardization at the time.

The 1935–1939 shift: bringing cannabis medicines under control
- Egypt renewed pressure in 1935 for a broader interpretation: to include any medication containing any proportion of cannabis under international control. This push sought to close the dilution loophole and better target non‑medical uses concealed within ostensibly medicinal products.
- By 1939 the international community accepted this extension. The amendment brought medicines containing cannabis under control regardless of composition, removing the earlier concentration‑based escape route. This marked an incremental tightening of the international regime and foreshadowed more comprehensive post‑war treaties.

Practical impact and legacy
- Short term: the measures principally constrained international, cross‑border trafficking in concentrated cannabis preparations, while leaving domestic regulation largely to national authorities. The certificate regime introduced procedural checks on legal medical trade but did not eliminate illicit markets.
- Long term: the 1939 extension reduced one major loophole and established a precedent for progressive broadening of international control — a trajectory that culminated in the mid‑20th century (notably the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs) in far more comprehensive and intrusive global regulation of cannabis.
- Enforcement challenges that had been flagged by objecting States (wild growth, cultural tolerance, administrative capacity) persisted and continued to influence how treaties were implemented on the ground.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Sovereignty and domestic leeway: The compromise illustrates a recurrent theme in India’s strategic culture — an assertive defence of domestic prerogatives and social norms in international fora. By opposing an absolute ban, India sought to preserve policy space to manage internal social order and public health according to local realities.
- Pragmatism and capacity awareness: India’s objections reflected a pragmatic appreciation of limits in enforcement capacity and governance reach. This pragmatism has continued to shape Indian approaches to multilateral obligations that intersect with domestic social practices.
- Colonial legacy and international bargaining posture: The negotiation also exposed colonial-era tensions that informed India’s later insistence on negotiating space in international regimes. Managing imperial expectations while defending indigenous practices shaped Indian diplomatic behavior and its eventual post‑colonial stance on sovereignty.
- Precedent for regulatory evolution: The incremental tightening from 1920s compromise to the 1939 expansion shows how early technical drafting (e.g., concentration thresholds, certificate mechanisms) can have outsized effects on state behaviour and on the scope of international authority. For Indian security planners, such legal architecture matters: treaty wording can create enforcement burdens or preserve flexibility relevant to social stability and internal security.
- Strategic takeaways: For contemporary policy, the episode cautions that international legal commitments in areas touching social or cultural practices require careful assessment of domestic enforcement capacity, potential for unintended social disruption, and long‑term trajectories of treaty evolution that may progressively reduce national policy space.

Concluding observation
- The 1920s–1939 negotiations over “Indian hemp” exemplify how international drug control emerged through a mix of moral concern, technical legal drafting, and geopolitical bargaining. For India, the debates were not only about a plant or its products: they were about preserving domestic policy autonomy, managing colonial governance constraints, and negotiating the balance between international obligations and social realities — themes central to India’s strategic culture and to the formulation of its national security policies.

### International drug‑control architecture: from the Opium Conventions to the INCB — origins, controversy and institutional continuity

This short section sketches the formative international institutions and treaties that shaped twentieth‑century drug control, highlights contested historiography about the inclusion of cannabis controls, and explains the post‑war transfer and consolidation of mandates into United Nations organs — with brief notes on implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy.

Background: the early conventions
- The international drug‑control regime begins with the First International Opium Convention (The Hague, 1912) and is substantially expanded by the Second International Opium Convention (The Hague, 1925). These treaties constitute the early architecture for global regulation of opiates and other substances and embed mechanisms for supervision and information exchange among states.
- The 1925 Convention is particularly significant because it extended international controls beyond opium to other substances — most controversially, cannabis — marking a turning point in what substances became matters of international concern.

Contested origins: the 1925 cannabis decision and the 1935–39 episodes
- Scholars have long debated why cannabis was placed under international control in 1925. A strand of historical interpretation argues that the decision cannot be understood purely as a neutral technical judgment about public health or addiction; rather, it must be read against the political and social context of the interwar, colonial world.
- Some historians characterise the 1925 inclusion (and related diplomatic episodes in the later 1930s) as shaped by racialized and imperial attitudes. These arguments point to colonial‑era stereotypes about “native” drug use and moralizing rhetoric from certain delegations as factors that influenced the expansion of controls — hence the label by some commentators that the 1925 decision was “racist” in its roots or rationales.
- This controversy remains an active field of scholarly debate. The competing readings highlight a methodological point relevant to policy: legal instruments and regulatory architecture are the product of politics and power as much as of public‑health evidence. For states like India, with colonial legacies, these origins influence both legal continuities and contemporary policy debates.

Post‑war legal and institutional continuity: transferring mandates to the UN system
- After World War II the international institutional map was reorganised. Mandates, functions and dossiers previously held by League of Nations organs, and by other interwar bodies, were transferred into newly established United Nations institutions to preserve legal continuity and to adapt oversight to the post‑war multilateral order.
- The Office international d’hygiène publique (OIHP), a Paris‑based pre‑UN international public‑health agency, is a notable example: many of its technical functions and normative inheritances were absorbed by the World Health Organization when WHO was established under the UN framework.
- Likewise, the supervisory functions created under the opium conventions — including the Permanent Central Opium Board (PCOB) and the Drug Supervisory Body (DSB) — were subsumed within the UN system as the task of international drug control was rationalised and centralised.

Consolidation: the 1961 Single Convention and the INCB
- Both the 1912 and 1925 Conventions were ultimately superseded by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961). The Single Convention sought to simplify and harmonise the treaty framework into a single legal instrument, standardise scheduling, and provide clearer obligations for states.
- A key institutional innovation was the merger of the PCOB and the DSB into the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB). The INCB is an independent, quasi‑judicial body charged with monitoring states’ compliance with treaty obligations and controlling international trade in scheduled narcotics. Its creation marked the consolidation of technical supervision, reporting, and trade control functions under a specialised multilateral organ.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s contemporary legal and policy approach to drugs cannot be fully understood without reference to this historical and institutional lineage. Colonial‑era statutes and the international treaty framework inherited by post‑colonial states shaped domestic institutions, enforcement priorities and international obligations.
- The contested origins of cannabis prohibition, and the broader recognition that drug control regimes were influenced by imperial politics, have contemporary salience. Debates in India about public health, criminalisation, and law‑enforcement priorities are informed both by international treaty obligations (notably the 1961 Single Convention) and by domestic assessments of national security, social stability and public health.
- For policymakers, a historically informed view matters: it clarifies where obligations are legally binding, where institutional flexibility exists, and how historical grievances or perceptions can affect legitimacy and compliance — all important when tailoring drug control measures within a national security framework.

Concluding remark
Understanding the transition from the League‑era Opium Conventions through the contested 1925 decisions, and the post‑war transfer and consolidation of functions into the UN/WHO and into the INCB, illuminates both the legal continuity of international drug control and the political origins that shape contemporary policy debates — including those central to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.
