# Introduction — International Water Management Institute (IWMI)

The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is a leading non‑profit research organisation whose applied work on water, land and ecosystems has direct bearing on food security, development and environmental protection across South and Southeast Asia and sub‑Saharan Africa. For a book concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security policy, IWMI is salient not only as a source of empirical evidence and technical innovation but also as an actor that shapes policy debates about water security, cross‑border river management, agricultural resilience and climate adaptation — domains increasingly central to national security.

## Institutional profile and history
- IWMI is an international, non‑profit research institute headquartered in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Its institutional origins date to the 1980s, when it emerged from earlier initiatives under the name International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) before broadening its remit and adopting the IWMI identity.
- The institute is a member of CGIAR, the global consortium of agricultural research centres devoted to sustainable development and food security. Within CGIAR, IWMI leads the Research Program on Water, Land and Ecosystems (WLE) and has been a partner in several other CGIAR programs, including Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS), Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), Dryland Systems, and Integrated Systems for the Humid Tropics.

## Mandate and core objectives
IWMI’s institutional aim is deliberately applied and development‑oriented: to improve the management of water and land resources so as to underpin food security, reduce poverty and protect the environment. Key features of this mandate are:
- A focus on productive uses of water — understanding how water is currently used in agriculture and other livelihoods and identifying ways to increase its productivity and economic value.
- Attention to water availability and access, including the hydrological and infrastructural constraints that shape distribution and scarcity.
- Research on water quality and the links among water, human health and ecosystem health.
- Investigation of governance: institutional arrangements, policy instruments and the social processes through which societies manage water resources at local, river‑basin and national levels.
- Engagement with climate change adaptation to assess how changing hydrological regimes alter risks to agriculture, livelihoods and national stability.

## Geographic footprint and relevance to India
- IWMI maintains a strong presence across Africa and Asia, with regional offices and country programmes that focus on developing‑country contexts. Its South Asia work — and its Colombo headquarters — make IWMI directly relevant to India’s water policy environment.
- For India, IWMI’s research has particular pertinence to irrigated agriculture, groundwater over‑exploitation, urban water demands, pollution of rivers, and the governance of large transboundary basins (e.g., the Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra systems). These are all issues with clear links to national food security, rural livelihoods and interstate relations.

## Research approaches and interdisciplinary methods
IWMI’s work is characterised by interdisciplinary methods combining:
- Hydrology and physical science (surface and groundwater assessment, water accounting);
- Agronomy and engineering (irrigation technologies, water‑saving interventions);
- Social science and economics (institutional analysis, cost–benefit assessment, poverty impacts);
- Policy and governance studies (regulatory frameworks, stakeholder engagement, scaling pathways).
This integration allows IWMI to move from technical diagnosis to policy‑relevant recommendations and pilot interventions intended to influence practice.

## Outputs, capacity building and audiences
IWMI produces a range of outputs tailored for policy and practice:
- Technical reports, datasets and modelling tools (water accounting, scenario analysis).
- Policy briefs and normative guidance aimed at governments, basin agencies and donors.
- Pilot projects and demonstration interventions in irrigation, groundwater management and ecosystem protection.
- Capacity building: training for local water managers, district officials and community organisations.
Primary stakeholders and users include national governments, basin authorities, local water managers, farming communities, NGOs, donors and international agencies.

## Partnerships, credibility and influence
- IWMI’s membership in and leadership of CGIAR research programs anchor it within extensive international research and donor networks, enhancing pathways for influence on national and regional policy.
- The institute’s scientific and policy impact has been internationally recognised: in 2012 IWMI received the Stockholm Water Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the water sector. The citation highlighted IWMI’s pioneering research in agricultural water management and its measurable contributions to food security, environmental health protection and poverty alleviation in developing countries.
- Such recognition signals credibility with policymakers and elevates IWMI’s role as an authoritative voice in technical and governance debates.

## Research trade‑offs and normative dilemmas
IWMI’s work frequently navigates trade‑offs central to both development and security policy:
- Agricultural productivity versus ecosystem health — e.g., expansion or intensification of irrigation may increase yields but can harm river flows, wetlands and downstream users.
- Short‑term livelihood gains versus long‑term sustainability — groundwater pumping that secures incomes today may degrade future resource bases.
- Equity and allocation conflicts — water allocation decisions can entrench or relieve social and regional inequalities, with implications for political stability.
IWMI’s analyses aim to make these trade‑offs explicit and to propose institutional arrangements that balance competing objectives.

## Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security
Several dimensions of IWMI’s work intersect directly with strategic concerns:
- Water security as national security: IWMI’s evidence on water scarcity, groundwater depletion and climate impacts informs assessments of vulnerability in food production and rural stability.
- Transboundary governance: research on basin management and institutional mechanisms is germane to India’s relations with upstream and downstream neighbours and to confidence‑building in contentious water basins.
- Climate adaptation and resilience: IWMI’s scenario analyses and adaptation strategies help policymakers prioritise investments that reduce exposure to hydrological shocks and attendant migration or conflict risks.
- Policy formation and civil‑military planning: IWMI’s data, modelling tools and policy briefs are resources for civilian planners and can feed into broader national security assessments that consider non‑military threats.

## Conclusion
IWMI exemplifies how specialised, applied research organisations operate at the intersection of science, policy and development practice. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, IWMI is important not simply as a technical knowledge producer but as a convener of evidence and a shaper of policy choices that influence food security, environmental resilience and the governance of shared water resources — all of which have clear implications for national security strategy in the 21st century.

### The International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) / International Water Management Institute (IWMI): Institutional Diagnosis and the Rise of Participatory Irrigation Management

Founding and mandate
- Founded in 1985 as the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI). Primary founding partners were the Ford Foundation and the Government of Sri Lanka; the institute received technical and financial support from the CGIAR system and the World Bank.
- IIMI’s initial mandate was focused and diagnostic: to investigate why many large-scale irrigation systems built or expanded during the Green Revolution were failing to deliver expected benefits in the 1970s–1980s and to identify institutional remedies.

Historical context: from the Green Revolution to underperforming systems
- The Green Revolution (roughly 1940s–1970s) involved massive public and donor investment in large-scale irrigation infrastructure together with fertilizers, pesticides and high-yielding seed varieties. These investments substantially increased production of staple food crops in many countries and underpinned early food-security gains.
- By the mid-1980s, however, many of those irrigation systems were delivering less than their technical potential. Canal systems silted, distribution became unequal, operation and maintenance (O&M) deteriorated, and user satisfaction fell—problems that increasingly appeared to be institutional rather than purely engineering failures.

Institutional diagnosis: what IIMI found
- IIMI’s research emphasized that institutional factors were often the principal constraints on irrigation performance. Key recurring problems included:
  - Unclear or insecure water rights that left users without incentives to conserve or invest.
  - Overly centralized control of water allocation and operations that ignored local variability and need.
  - Perverse or absent incentive structures for managers and users, undermining efficient water use.
  - Chronic underfunding of O&M and weak mechanisms for cost recovery.
  - Weak local governance and lack of farmer voice in operational decisions.
- This institutional framing shifted attention away from purely technical fixes (dredging canals, upgrading pumps) toward governance, incentives and local-level arrangements.

Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM)
- Based on its findings, IIMI strongly promoted Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM), an approach that places farmers and local water users at the centre of day-to-day decisions about irrigation systems.
- Typical features of PIM include farmer involvement in operations and maintenance, locally negotiated allocation rules, collection of user fees for cost recovery, and formalized water-user organizations or associations.
- Claimed and observed benefits of PIM: improved allocation efficiency, better maintenance and system reliability, greater cost-recovery and financial sustainability, and strengthened local stewardship and accountability.

Policy diffusion and international legitimation
- IIMI’s evidence and advocacy helped move PIM from pilot experiments to mainstream policy. The World Bank and CGIAR networks played important roles in scaling up PIM through lending, technical assistance and knowledge dissemination.
- The 1992 Rio Earth Summit, with its broader endorsement of decentralization and stakeholder participation in natural-resource governance, provided powerful international legitimation for PIM principles. While PIM encountered resistance—especially from entrenched bureaucracies used to centralized control—it increasingly became standard policy advice for governments and major lending agencies through the 1990s and 2000s.

Institutional evolution: IIMI to IWMI
- IIMI became a member of the CGIAR system in 1991, reinforcing its research and policy influence.
- Over time the institute broadened its mandate beyond irrigation management to encompass integrated water management and the multiple uses and values of water. It later rebranded as the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), reflecting this wider remit.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Irrigation governance is not only an agricultural or technical issue but a facet of national resilience and strategic culture. In India—where irrigation underpins food security, rural livelihoods and socio-political stability—the institutional performance of irrigation systems has direct implications for domestic security and state legitimacy.
- The IIMI/IWMI diagnosis and PIM prescriptions informed debates and reforms in India: they legitimated decentralization of water management, supported the formation of water-user associations, and sharpened policy attention to O&M financing and local accountability. Such institutional reforms contribute to secure water and food supplies, reduce rural conflict over scarce resources, and enhance adaptive capacity in the face of climatic stress—all core concerns of national security planning.
- From a strategic perspective, the IIMI-IWMI trajectory illustrates a larger lesson for policymakers: durable resource security often requires institutional reform—clear rights, incentives aligned with stewardship, and empowered local governance—rather than only more infrastructure or technology.

Chronology at a glance
- 1985: IIMI founded.
- 1991: IIMI joins CGIAR.
- 1992: Rio Earth Summit endorses principles (decentralization, stakeholder participation) consonant with PIM.

Concluding note
- The IIMI/IWMI story is an instructive example of how empirical diagnosis of institutional failure can reshape policy paradigms and international assistance. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, it underscores that securing vital resources such as water depends as much on institutions and governance as on hardware—an insight with enduring implications for national security strategy.

## From Isolated Irrigation Studies to Basin-scale Water Security: Institutional and Analytical Shifts since the Mid‑1990s

Summary
- By the mid‑1990s, mounting competition for water — driven by population growth, urbanization and expanding industrial demand — exposed the limits of studying irrigation as an isolated sector. Water could no longer be treated as an effectively infinite input for agriculture. Research and policy needed to move to a river‑basin perspective that recognized multiple users, ecosystem needs and transboundary linkages.  
- The International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI) broadened its remit accordingly and in 1998 renamed itself the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). IWMI’s flagship assessment, Water for Food, Water for Life, mapped global scarcity and introduced the widely used distinctions between physical and economic water scarcity: about one third of the world’s population already faced scarcity under these metrics.  
- The methodological and institutional innovations spawned in this period — river‑basin governance, water accounting, remote sensing, environmental‑flow science and a focus on institutional capacity — are now central to integrated water resources management (IWRM) and have direct implications for national security and strategic planning, particularly in water‑stress states such as India.

1. Why the shift occurred: drivers and analytic failings
- Drivers of increased competition: late 20th‑century demographic expansion, rapid urbanization and industrialization raised municipal and industrial demand for freshwater in many basins. Simultaneously, awareness grew of environmental services supplied by rivers, wetlands and freshwater ecosystems.  
- Limits of the sectoral approach: treating irrigation in isolation missed critical interactions — upstream abstraction reducing downstream supply for cities or ecosystems, return flows degrading quality, and infrastructure decisions that shifted risks across users and borders. Policies based on irrigation‑only studies risked perverse outcomes when confronted with competing municipal, industrial and ecological claims.  
- The necessary conceptual move was to manage water at the hydrological scale (river basins) rather than by administrative sectors or political boundaries alone.

2. Institutional response: IIMI → IWMI (1998)
- Institutional realignment: IIMI expanded research programs beyond irrigation management to the broader questions of basin water allocation, environmental flows, water accounting and multi‑use systems. The 1998 renaming to the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) signified that broader remit.  
- Flagship assessment: IWMI’s Water for Food, Water for Life provided a global stocktake of water availability, use and deficits. Its maps and typologies brought scarcity into policy conversations by quantifying the spatial extent of water stress and by distinguishing different kinds of scarcity that require distinct responses.

3. New research themes and methods introduced or scaled up
- Open versus closed basins: recognizing hydrological closure is essential. Open basins discharge to the sea and generally have renewable inflows; closed basins lack significant outflow and are prone to depletion, salinization and long‑term storage loss. Policy responses differ sharply between these types.  
- Water accounting: systematic measurement of inflows, outflows, storage changes and consumptive use at basin scale provides a transparent basis for allocation, planning and dispute resolution. Accurate accounting is a prerequisite for credible allocations to agriculture, cities, industry and environment.  
- Multiple‑use water systems: designing systems to serve irrigation, domestic supply, industry and environmental needs simultaneously — including tradeoffs in timing and quantity — became an explicit research agenda.  
- Basin institutions and governance: research shifted toward institutional arrangements for basin management (river basin organizations, legal frameworks, stakeholder processes), including mechanisms for conflict mitigation and transboundary cooperation.  
- Remote sensing and geospatial analysis: satellite data enabled low‑cost, large‑scale monitoring of surface water, irrigated area, evapotranspiration and reservoir storage — critical for basins with sparse ground networks.  
- Environmental flows: quantifying and operationalizing minimum flows needed to sustain ecosystem services and downstream livelihoods became part of integrated planning.

4. Key definitions and empirical findings from the assessment literature
- Physical water scarcity: a situation in which renewable water resources are insufficient to meet a population’s demands. Indicators frequently use per capita renewable water or measures of demand relative to supply.  
- Economic water scarcity: where water is physically available but unmet needs persist because of lack of infrastructure, investment, institutions or human capacity to capture, distribute or treat water. In other words, scarcity driven by socioeconomic and governance failures rather than resource limits.  
- Empirical finding (from the IWMI assessment): roughly one third of the global population already experienced water scarcity under the assessment’s mapping — a finding that reframed water as a constrained, strategic resource rather than an abundant input.

5. Additional analytical and practical points
- Integrated basin management as best practice: the basin perspective underpins IWRM and has since been widely adopted as the normative approach to reconcile multiple water demands and to sustain ecosystems.  
- Water accounting’s role: beyond planning, water accounting supports transparent allocation, enables monitoring of compliance and helps identify where efficiency gains are feasible.  
- Remote sensing’s utility: it provides consistent, repeatable observations for tracking water availability and land–water interactions, especially in transboundary basins and regions with sparse hydrometric networks.  
- Differentiating scarcity types for policy targeting: physical scarcity calls for supply augmentation, demand management and allocation rules; economic scarcity calls for investment in infrastructure, institutions and capacity building.  
- Environmental flows as a security factor: sustaining flows secures ecosystem services (fisheries, flood moderation, groundwater recharge) and protects downstream livelihoods — failures that can produce social unrest and cross‑border tension.  
- Institutional capacity building: resolving economic scarcity and operationalizing basin policies depend on effective institutions, legal frameworks, information systems and stakeholder legitimacy.

6. Implications for policy, research and strategic planning (with relevance to India)
- Policy reorientation: move from siloed irrigation policy toward integrated river‑basin governance that explicitly balances agriculture, urban supply, industry and environmental needs. For India — with inter‑state river tensions, large agrarian dependence, burgeoning cities and several transboundary rivers — basin governance is an essential element of strategic stability.  
- Investment priorities: prioritize water accounting systems, monitoring networks (including remote sensing), urban water infrastructure and targeted irrigation investments where they yield the highest social return. Invest in river basin organizations that can mediate inter‑state and sectoral conflicts.  
- Research priorities: develop improved basin‑scale water accounting methods, fine‑grained remote sensing products for evapotranspiration and soil moisture, tools to value environmental flows, and models that quantify tradeoffs between food security, urban growth and ecosystem health under climate change.  
- Cross‑sector linkages: recognize water’s cascading impacts on food security, public health, industrial development and biodiversity — integrate water policy with national security assessments, urban planning and agricultural strategy.  
- Monitoring and periodic assessment: institutionalize regular basin and national assessments to track changes in scarcity under population growth and climate variability — these assessments are inputs to strategic forecasting and contingency planning.

7. Key terms (concise)
- IIMI → IWMI: institutional renaming in 1998 reflecting an expanded mandate from irrigation management to integrated water management.  
- River‑basin context: managing water according to hydrological boundaries rather than purely administrative or sectoral lines.  
- Open vs closed basins: open basins have natural outflows to the sea; closed basins lack outflow and are more vulnerable to depletion and salinization.  
- Water accounting: systematic measurement and reporting of basin inflows, outflows, consumptive use and storage changes.  
- Environmental flows: minimum or managed flows required to sustain aquatic ecosystems and the services they provide.  
- Physical scarcity vs Economic scarcity: resource‑limited scarcity versus scarcity caused by lack of infrastructure, investment or institutional capacity.

Conclusion: strategic stakes for India
- The conceptual and institutional shifts of the 1990s — epitomized by IWMI’s transition and its global assessment — carry clear lessons for India’s strategic culture. Water is not merely an agricultural input but a cross‑cutting strategic resource whose management shapes food security, urban resilience, interstate relations and international diplomacy (in the case of transboundary rivers). Recognizing the dual nature of scarcity (physical and economic), investing in basin‑scale accounting and monitoring, protecting environmental flows and building credible basin institutions should be regarded as components of India’s national security posture as much as of its development agenda.

## Reframing Water Scarcity: IWMI’s Influence and Implications for Indian Strategic Culture

The International Water Management Institute (IWMI) played a pivotal role in shifting how the international community—policy makers, scientists and donors—conceives of water scarcity. By reframing scarcity not merely as a local, technical problem but as a systemic, cross‑sectoral and security‑relevant challenge, IWMI elevated water from a developmental commodity to an issue of strategic consequence. That intellectual reframing altered global discourse, influenced major international events and produced concrete policy prescriptions that are directly relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security planning.

Key moments in the reframing
- UN World Water Day 2007 adopted the theme “Coping with Water Scarcity,” signalling a normative shift at the UN level toward scarcity as a policy priority.  
- The Worldwatch Institute’s State of the World 2008 included an explicit chapter on water management, bringing water issues into mainstream environmental policy debates.  
- In 2009, high‑profile assessments by the World Economic Forum and UNESCO judged water scarcity a larger systemic threat than the 2008 financial crisis—an assertion that pushed water up the agenda of security and economic strategists.  
- Dr. Rajendra K. Pachauri, then chair of the IPCC, emphasized water scarcity as a critical challenge at the 2009 Nobel Conference, linking climate, water and security.  
- By 2010 IWMI presented a practical six‑point plan at Stockholm World Water Week to avert a global water crisis.  
- IWMI’s 25th anniversary in 2011 was marked by commissioned essays exploring agriculture and development—further crystallising the link between agricultural water use and broader economic and security outcomes.

The magnitude of the challenge
- IWMI and allied analyses projected that, if current trends continue, global annual water use will rise by more than 2 trillion cubic metres by 2030, reaching approximately 6.9 trillion m3.  
- That projected demand is nearly 40% higher than available water supplies, implying a substantial global supply–demand gap and heightened risk of localized and transboundary instability.

The six‑point plan (IWMI, Stockholm World Water Week 2010) and their applicability to India
IWMI’s six priorities form a compact policy architecture that resonates with India’s strategic needs. They are briefly restated and annotated for India’s context:

1. Gather high‑quality data about water resources  
   - What it means: systematic hydrological monitoring, groundwater assessments, consumption metrics, remote sensing and climate projections.  
   - India relevance: credible, disaggregated data is foundational for national planning, dispute arbitration between states, and transboundary river diplomacy. Data deficits undermine both developmental policy and strategic forecasting.

2. Take better care of the environment  
   - What it means: protecting catchments, restoring rivers and wetlands, maintaining ecological flows and biodiversity.  
   - India relevance: environmental stewardship reduces vulnerability to floods, droughts and water degradation—phenomena with direct security and humanitarian implications.

3. Reform governance of water resources  
   - What it means: implement integrated water resources management (IWRM), clarify institutional roles, introduce appropriate pricing and strengthen regulatory capacity; enhance transboundary cooperation.  
   - India relevance: governance reform addresses interstate river disputes, municipal–agricultural allocation tensions and lays the institutional foundation for resilient national water security.

4. Revitalize agricultural water use  
   - What it means: improve irrigation efficiency, change crop portfolios toward less water‑intensive varieties, adopt drip/sprinkler and other water‑saving technologies, and promote safe wastewater reuse.  
   - India relevance: agriculture consumes the bulk of India’s water. Efficiency gains and crop diversification reduce vulnerability in food production and lower political stress during droughts.

5. Better manage urban and municipal water demands  
   - What it means: reduce leaks, deploy universal metering, institute demand management, invest in resilient distribution and storage infrastructure.  
   - India relevance: rapid urbanization imposes acute stress on municipal systems; failure to manage urban water can produce social unrest and strategic vulnerabilities in megacities.

6. Involve marginalized people in water management decisions  
   - What it means: inclusive governance that integrates the needs and knowledge of smallholders, women, indigenous and otherwise marginalised communities.  
   - India relevance: inclusive processes improve equity, enhance local legitimacy of policy measures, and reduce conflict potential where resource allocation is contested.

Strategic implications for India’s national security policy
- From development to security: Reframing scarcity elevates water as a cross‑cutting strategic variable that affects food security, economic performance, urban stability and defence logistics. Indian strategic culture must thus integrate water into threat assessments and contingency planning.  
- Mobilising resources and cross‑sector action: Elevation of water scarcity can mobilise domestic and international funding for infrastructure, data systems and institutional reforms—resources that otherwise might remain siloed.  
- Transboundary diplomacy: Data transparency and new governance models reduce the risk of interstate tensions over rivers originating in or passing through India.  
- Climate as multiplier: Climate change amplifies water stress; India’s strategic planning must therefore adopt multisectoral resilience strategies that intersect water, agriculture, energy and urban policy.  
- Equity and legitimacy: Involving marginalised groups is not just an ethical imperative; it is a strategic necessity. Policies that marginalise vulnerable populations can create domestic instability that has cascading security effects.

Conclusion
IWMI’s intellectual and policy interventions transformed water from an engineering or agricultural issue into a systemic, security‑relevant domain. For India, the lessons are direct: reliable data, environmental protection, governance reform, agricultural and urban water efficiency, and inclusive decision‑making are not only development measures but elements of national resilience and security. Integrating IWMI’s six‑point architecture into India’s strategic culture will help convert the recognition of scarcity into effective, equitable and durable policy responses.

### Case study: “Intelligent rationing” in Gujarat — managing electricity, groundwater and livelihoods

Background and problem statement
- From the 1970s onward, state-level policies in India subsidized electricity to farmers to promote agricultural development and rural welfare. Two linked structural problems emerged. First, heavily-subsidized rural power rendered electricity utilities financially unsustainable. Second, easy and cheap access to power encouraged the widespread sinking and electrification of tube‑wells, accelerating groundwater extraction and long‑term aquifer depletion.
- Subsidies thus created a perverse dynamic: farmers could pump from ever greater depths at little marginal cost, while utilities faced rising costs and losses. Where attempts were made to remove or meaningfully reduce subsidies, powerful agricultural lobbies mobilized politically; several chief ministers who moved in that direction lost political support or office. Direct subsidy removal proved politically infeasible in many states.

Why an alternative was necessary
- The confluence of deteriorating utility finances, accelerating groundwater decline, and intense rural political resistance meant that standard economic prescriptions (cut subsidies, meter and charge farmers) could not be implemented at scale in the short term. A pragmatic, politically-feasible policy instrument was required—one that constrained excessive groundwater use, improved the quality of rural electricity supply, and avoided direct confrontation with powerful farming constituencies.

The IWMI proposal: “intelligent rationing”
- Scientists at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) proposed a pragmatic supply‑management solution often called “intelligent rationing.” The central components are:
  - Separate feeders (distinct power supply lines) for agricultural loads and for non‑agricultural rural consumers (households, schools, clinics, small industries).
  - For agriculture, provision of a reliable, high‑quality supply for a fixed, predictable number of hours per day, at tariffs that remain affordable but are tied to metered feeder usage (rather than unmetered, unlimited supply).
  - Enforcement and technical design focus on feeder-level metering and physical separation rather than metering every individual farmer, recognising the political and administrative difficulties of household‑level enforcement in rural India.
- The policy aligns supply options to political constraints: instead of directly cutting a subsidy broadly perceived as an entitlement, it constrains and schedules supply in a transparent way that limits extraction incentives while preserving a predictable allocation for irrigation.

Policy adoption in Gujarat and reform design
- Gujarat incorporated elements of this approach into a larger electricity utility reform program. Reforms emphasised feeder separation, scheduled agricultural supply hours, feeder-level metering and loss reduction, and preferential improvement of supply quality for non‑agricultural feeders.
- The design sought to reduce cross‑subsidisation and the retaliatory behaviour that had previously degraded rural power quality: when agricultural users drew uncontrolled power, they often caused voltage collapse and outages that disproportionately harmed households, schools and local enterprise.

Observed impacts and magnitudes
- Post‑reform studies in Gujarat reported benefits larger than many analysts had anticipated:
  - Non‑agricultural rural consumers—households, schools and small enterprises—experienced substantial improvements in power quality and reliability. These improvements had measurable welfare payoffs: better lighting and appliance use in homes, improved classroom conditions and study time in schools, and greater continuity for local productive activities.
  - Agricultural illicit tapping and “stealing” of power (illegal connections and hook‑ups) declined when feeders were physically separated and supply hours were fixed and enforceable. Prior to reform, the ubiquity of illicit tapping meant tube‑well owners effectively held rural distribution networks “hostage,” degrading service for others to secure uncontrolled access to irrigation power.
  - Utility performance improved through better load management, reduced technical and commercial losses on non‑agricultural feeders, and clearer accountability — increasing the prospects for financial viability without politically unacceptable blanket subsidy removal.

Operational and political advantages of the approach
- By targeting feeders instead of individuals, the approach reduced political confrontation: farmers retained a reliable, scheduled supply (and thus could defend the arrangement politically), while the state gained tools to manage aggregate demand and protect other rural consumers.
- Feeder‑level interventions are administratively simpler and more politically palatable than attempting to meter millions of individual pumps and bill farmers at full cost.

Risks, limitations and enforcement challenges
- Metering and enforcement still pose challenges. Illegal connections can reappear without vigilant monitoring and maintenance of physical infrastructure.
- A key risk is fuel switching: if rationed hours or supply quality are perceived as insufficient, some farmers may revert to diesel pumps, raising production costs, increasing greenhouse gas and local emissions, and eroding the anticipated groundwater and fiscal gains.
- Success depends on credible and sustained utility governance — the reforms require monitoring, political commitment to prevent roll‑back, and community engagement to legitimize and enforce new norms around feeder use.

Broader policy lessons and integration needs
- “Intelligent rationing” is not a silver bullet. For long‑term sustainability it must be embedded in integrated water–energy policies:
  - Complementary measures, such as groundwater regulation (licensing or extraction caps), crop‑choice incentives, and targeted subsidies for water‑efficient irrigation technologies, reduce the incentives for over‑extraction.
  - Where feasible, gradual tariff reform targeted at richer users, combined with social protection for vulnerable farmers, helps address distributional concerns while improving utility finances.
- Successful replication requires local adaptation. Hydrogeology, cropping systems, farm sizes, and the political economy of rural constituencies differ across states and districts; policy instruments must be calibrated to these realities. Community engagement and transparent governance are essential to deter illegal tapping and build acceptance.

Implications for strategic culture and national security policy
- Resource governance touches core concerns of state capacity, social stability and national security. In rural India, the management of water and electricity is not merely a technocratic issue; it is deeply political and affects livelihoods, electoral behaviour, and social cohesion.
- Practical, politically‑attuned reforms such as intelligent rationing show how states can improve service delivery and fiscal sustainability without provoking destabilising backlash. Better electricity for households and schools contributes to human development, which in turn reduces vulnerability to social unrest.
- Conversely, failure to manage the water–energy nexus can exacerbate livelihood stress, internal migration, and local conflict—outcomes with clear implications for internal security and the resilience of the state.
- From a strategic‑culture perspective, the Gujarat example illustrates an important trait of pragmatic Indian policymaking: the search for institutionally feasible, incremental reforms that reconcile technical objectives with entrenched politics. Such approaches are often more durable than top‑down imposition of “optimal” economic policies that ignore political constraints.

Conclusion
- The IWMI‑informed reforms in Gujarat represent a salutary example of how technical innovation, informed political judgment and institutional design can jointly address intertwined water‑energy problems. By separating feeders and rationing agricultural supply in a predictable way, policymakers achieved surprising welfare gains for non‑agricultural rural users, reduced illicit power use, and improved utility performance — all without direct removal of politically sensitive subsidies.
- For policymakers concerned with national security and strategic stability, the lesson is clear: sustainable resource management must be politically realistic, institutionally enforceable and socially inclusive. Integrating sensible supply management with complementary regulatory and incentive tools offers a pathway to reconcile livelihoods, environmental sustainability and state capacity.
