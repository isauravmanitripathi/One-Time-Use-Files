## The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty‑Four (G‑24): Purpose, Structure, and Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture

Concise summary
- The Intergovernmental Group of Twenty‑Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development (G‑24) is a coordinating forum created in 1971 as a chapter of the Group of 77 (G‑77). Its core purpose is to coordinate positions of developing countries on international monetary and development finance issues so that those interests are represented in multilateral negotiations, notably at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Although the IMF provides secretariat and technical support for G‑24 meetings, the group is not an organ of the Fund. G‑24 meetings are held biannually, timed to precede the IMF/World Bank Spring and Annual Meetings, allowing members to consolidate positions on agenda items that will be debated in those global fora.

Origins, membership and institutional character
- Founding rationale: The G‑24 was created in 1971 out of the broader G‑77 coalition to give developing countries a focused vehicle for collective action on monetary and development finance matters. Its creation reflected a recognition that the institutional design and policy frameworks of the global financial architecture — exchange rate regimes, conditional lending, liquidity mechanisms — had profound distributional consequences for development.
- Name versus membership: The “Twenty‑Four” in the name reflects the original roster of founding participants. Over time membership expanded: the G‑24 now comprises more states than the original 24 (membership had expanded beyond the founding number; authors compiling country lists should cite the G‑24 secretariat for an authoritative, dated roster). China participates as a “Special Invitee,” a status that signals engagement without full membership.
- Institutional form: The G‑24 is a coordination forum rather than a decision‑making organ. It issues communiqués, technical notes and policy positions designed to influence IMF/World Bank agendas, but it does not have treaty authority or binding instruments.

Mandate, agenda and typical workstreams
- Core mandate: To formulate and advance collective positions of developing countries on international monetary matters and development finance.
- Typical agenda topics: exchange rate and surveillance frameworks; the international financial architecture; debt sustainability and restructuring; access to concessional finance; Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) and their allocation/redistribution; macrofinancial policy conditionality; and crisis prevention and resolution mechanisms.
- Outputs and methods: G‑24 outputs are principally consultative communiqués, technical briefs and coordinated messaging delivered ahead of major IMF/World Bank deliberations. The secretariat support provided by the IMF often includes logistical assistance and access to technical briefings, but this support is administrative rather than managerial of G‑24 policy.

Relationship with the IMF and timing of meetings
- Formal relationship: The G‑24 is independent of IMF governance structures. The IMF provides secretariat services (logistics, meeting facilities, technical briefings) which facilitate the G‑24’s work, but this support does not render the G‑24 an IMF organ or give the IMF a controlling role over the group’s policy positions.
- Strategic timing: G‑24 normally meets twice a year—before the Spring and Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank. This scheduling is deliberate: it permits developing‑country ministers and officials to cohere positions and negotiating lines in advance of international ministerial fora where decisions on global financial policies and resource allocations are made.

Function, influence and limitations
- Coordinating forum: The G‑24’s strength lies in collective voice and technical coordination. It aggregates negotiating positions, identifies shared priorities among a diverse set of developing countries, and seeks to shape the framing of policy debates at the IMF and World Bank.
- Limits to influence: The group has no binding authority; its influence depends on the persuasiveness of its technical arguments, the cohesion of its membership, and wider geopolitical alignments. Heterogeneity among member states — in economic size, development model and geopolitical orientation — constrains unanimity and bargaining leverage.
- Examples of engagement: Historically, the G‑24 has been an active interlocutor on issues such as SDR allocation, calls for reform of conditionality frameworks, and advocacy for more development‑oriented international financial architecture. Concrete policy impacts are best demonstrated through case studies (for example, G‑24 positions in specific IMF/World Bank policy debates), which should be documented from primary communiqués and secondary analyses.

China’s status and wider geopolitics
- Special Invitee status: China’s participation as a “Special Invitee” allows for its involvement in technical discussions without formal membership. This arrangement embodies the complex geopolitics of Global South coordination — major emerging economies may engage selectively with coalition platforms while preserving distinct strategic postures.
- Implications for India: The presence of large emerging powers, and the flexibility of membership categories, affects coalition dynamics and India’s strategy for marshaling Global South consensus on economic governance.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Economic statecraft and security: India’s engagement with the G‑24 aligns with a broader strategic culture that treats economic policy and multilateral diplomacy as components of national security. Ensuring favorable rules and practices in international finance affects India’s macroeconomic stability, external debt profile, access to liquidity, and capacity for development investment — all of which have direct bearings on national resilience.
- Coalition building: Participation in the G‑24 complements India’s non‑aligned and South‑South diplomacy by offering an institutionalized platform to coordinate with other developing countries on key financial governance issues. This supports India’s efforts to shape norms on debt relief, development finance, and reforms to global financial institutions.
- Tactical uses: India can use G‑24 meetings to refine negotiating positions ahead of IMF/World Bank engagements, to build issue‑based alliances, and to amplify policy proposals (for example on SDR use or concessional finance) that support its developmental and strategic priorities.

Scholarly and evidentiary considerations (article maintenance and improvement)
- Source quality concerns: Existing encyclopedia‑style treatments of the G‑24 have attracted editorial flags for reliance on a single source and for excessive dependence on primary sources. Scholarly treatments should therefore corroborate institutional claims with secondary and tertiary analyses.
- Recommended improvements for any article or chapter:
  - Add reliable secondary sources: peer‑reviewed articles, monographs on international financial governance, and analyses of Global South diplomacy.
  - Provide a current, dated list of member countries and indicate when membership expanded beyond the original 24; cite the G‑24 secretariat for a definitive roster.
  - Clarify procedural relations with the IMF: detail the nature and limits of secretariat support.
  - Replace wiki‑format clutter with clear exposition, and resolve maintenance templates by sourcing claims to high‑quality literature.
  - Include concrete case studies showing G‑24 influence on specific policy outcomes at the IMF/World Bank.

Recommended documentary and scholarly sources
- Primary sources: G‑24 communiqués and technical notes (official G‑24 website/secretariat); IMF and World Bank press releases and staff reports relating to G‑24 engagements.
- Secondary sources: scholarly work on developing‑country coalitions and global economic governance, and studies of IMF reform and SDR policy (journals such as International Organization, Review of International Political Economy, World Development). Monographs and edited volumes on the G‑77, South‑South cooperation, and IMF history are particularly useful.
- Methodological note: For any academic treatment, triangulate primary G‑24 documents with independent IMF/World Bank analyses and peer‑reviewed scholarship to avoid undue reliance on self‑descriptions.

Conclusion — what to include in a focused book chapter
- For a compact, policy‑relevant chapter addressing G‑24 in the context of India’s strategic culture:
  - Provide a succinct institutional history and mission statement.
  - Explain the group’s procedural relationship with the IMF and the practical meaning of IMF secretariat support.
  - Discuss agenda items of strategic relevance (SDRs, debt, financial architecture) and give at least one brief case study showing G‑24 advocacy in action.
  - Analyse how India leverages the G‑24 for economic statecraft and how that activity fits into India’s broader national security calculus.
  - Conclude with a concise bibliography emphasizing primary communiqués and a small set of high‑quality secondary sources, and advise readers to consult the G‑24 secretariat for the current member list and dated materials.

### The G‑24: Membership, Composition and Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture

Summary
- The Group of Twenty‑Four (G‑24) is an institutional mechanism through which developing countries coordinate positions on international monetary and development finance issues, particularly in forums such as the IMF and World Bank.  
- Below is a contemporary membership roster organized by the G‑24’s three regional groupings, followed by analytical observations and implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy.

Membership (by G‑24 regional groupings)
- Region I (Africa) — 11 members
  - Algeria, DR Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa
- Region II (Latin America and the Caribbean) — 10 members
  - Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Mexico, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela
- Region III (Asia) — 8 members
  - China, India, Iran, Lebanon, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Syria

Counts and nomenclature
- Total listed members above: 29. The designation “G‑24” is historical: the name has remained even as membership has expanded beyond 24. Membership rosters can also change over time; therefore, use the official G‑24 sources for the current list when citing membership.

Key observations and analytical implications
- Regional structure and representation: The tripartite regional format (Africa; Latin America & Caribbean; Asia) institutionalizes geographic breadth and ensures that negotiating positions are not dominated exclusively by any single region.
- Economic diversity: The membership spans major emerging economies (China, India, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, Nigeria) alongside small and middle‑income states (e.g., Haiti, Gabon, Trinidad & Tobago). This creates broad developmental perspectives but also divergent policy priorities.
- Geopolitical heterogeneity: The group includes states with varied geopolitical alignments and domestic priorities — including politically sensitive or sanctioned states (e.g., Iran, Syria, Venezuela). This heterogeneity can complicate consensus‑building but also lends the G‑24 legitimacy as a genuinely representative developing‑country coalition.
- Internal bargaining dynamics: Given disparities in size and global economic influence, larger members tend to exert disproportionate sway in shaping collective positions. Smaller members, however, can be pivotal in framing specific policy issues (debt relief, concessional finance, special drawing rights allocations).
- Policy focus: The G‑24’s raison d’être is coordination on global financial governance — IMF quotas and voice, World Bank lending and concessional windows, debt restructuring frameworks, and macroeconomic policy advice. Its outputs are therefore directly relevant to states’ economic security.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security
- India as both stakeholder and bridge: India’s membership places it within a formal coalition that advocates for developing‑country interests in systemic financial governance. For Indian strategic culture — which increasingly views economic statecraft and multilateral influence as components of national power — the G‑24 is a practical arena to advance economic security objectives.
- Coalition building and diplomatic leverage: Through the G‑24, India can build issue‑based coalitions with African and Latin American partners, amplify calls for reform of multilateral financial institutions, and push for policies (debt relief, counter‑cyclical finance, SDR allocations) that reduce vulnerabilities for developing economies.
- Balancing great‑power dynamics: China’s presence alongside India inside the G‑24 provides both opportunities for tactical alignment on specific development finance issues and challenges where strategic competition colors positions. India must therefore calibrate cooperation without ceding strategic autonomy.
- National security implications: Financial stability, access to development finance, and fair governance of the IMF/World Bank are core to economic resilience — a pillar of India’s national security. G‑24 advocacy on issues such as liquidity support during crises, sustainable debt frameworks, and reform of voting structures in multilateral institutions aligns with India’s aim to mitigate external economic shocks and preserve policy space.
- Constraints: The heterogeneity of the G‑24 necessitates compromise; India’s priorities may sometimes be diluted by coalition trade‑offs. Moreover, some member states’ international conduct (e.g., sanctions exposure) can complicate unified messaging and India’s own efforts at normative leadership.

Practical recommendations for analysts and policymakers
- Verify membership and date: Always cite the source and date when referencing G‑24 membership or positions. Membership lists and representatives can be updated; consult the official G‑24 website or recent communiqués for currency.
- Account for asymmetries: In assessing G‑24 positions, explicitly account for the influence of larger economies (China, India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Nigeria) when weighting likely outcomes of coordination efforts.
- Map regional levers: Use the three‑region structure to identify potential coalitions (e.g., Africa + Asia on debt relief) and likely fault lines (e.g., policy prescriptions where Latin American positions diverge).
- Use the G‑24 tactically: For India, the G‑24 should be treated as a platform for advancing multilateral economic governance reforms consonant with India’s strategic goals — but not as a substitute for bilateral or plurilateral engagements with major financial stakeholders.
- Cross‑check positions: When G‑24 communiqués are used to infer policy direction, cross‑reference with member country national statements and actions, since collective language may mask divergent national implementations.

Concluding note
- The G‑24’s membership composition — a blend of large emerging markets and smaller developing states across three regions — both empowers it as a representative voice for the developing world and constrains it through internal diversity. For India, engagement in the G‑24 is an instrument of strategic economic diplomacy: a forum to shape global financial governance in ways that strengthen national resilience and advance broader objectives of equitable development and multilateral reform.

## 5.x The G-24 Observer Ecosystem: Composition and Strategic Significance for Indian Policy

Summary

- The G-24’s meetings frequently include a set of observers that broaden and deepen the technical and political inputs to its deliberations.  
- Observers fall into two broad categories: state observers (non-member countries invited to participate) and institutional observers (intergovernmental organisations, regional bodies, and development finance or research institutions).  
- The mix includes both major developing and emerging-state actors and specialised international/regional institutions; together they signal the issues likely to animate G-24 agendas—energy and commodity markets, development finance, macroeconomic policy, and social/labour impacts.

State observers

- Angola — An African oil-exporting developing country. Angola’s attendance brings the perspective of oil-dependent fiscal regimes and the vulnerabilities of commodity-exporting economies to price shocks. For countries like India, engagement with such perspectives underscores the global interdependence of energy markets and the political economy of supply shocks.  
- Indonesia — A large emerging market and an influential regional actor. As an economy that straddles commodity-export and manufacturing profiles, Indonesia’s observer role conveys the priorities of emerging Asian producers and their stance on issues such as reserve management, exchange-rate policy and South–South cooperation.  
- Saudi Arabia — A major oil producer with outsized influence on global energy markets and associated financial flows. Saudi presence reinforces the salience of oil and fiscal policy in G-24 debates and highlights how producer interests can shape development-finance conversations.  
- United Arab Emirates — A Gulf economy with significant financial-market and development-investment interests. The UAE’s participation brings perspectives on sovereign-wealth management, commodity-linked finance, and investment flows between oil-rich states and developing-country borrowers.

Institutional observers

- Arab Monetary Fund — Regional financial institution serving Arab states; offers expertise on monetary cooperation, balance-of-payments support, and regional financial stability mechanisms. Its inputs enrich G-24 discussions on regional monetary frameworks and liquidity arrangements.  
- Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) — UN regional commission supplying specialised development analysis for Latin America; its research informs debates on structural transformation, social policy and heterodox macroeconomic responses to crises.  
- Group of 77 — The large coalition of developing countries; functions as a political interlocutor aligning wider developing-country stances. Its presence facilitates coordination between G-24 technical positions and broader developing-country political demands in international financial institutions.  
- International Labour Organization (ILO) — UN agency focused on labour standards and employment. The ILO contributes social-policy and employment-impact assessments, reminding macroeconomic debates of distributional and labour-market consequences.  
- Islamic Development Bank — Multilateral development bank for Muslim-majority countries; offers development-finance perspectives and project-level experience, particularly relevant to infrastructure and concessional financing discussions.  
- OPEC Fund for International Development — Established by OPEC members to provide concessional finance; its participation highlights south–south financing options and the role of oil-producer capital in development lending.  
- Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) — The cartel’s involvement brings direct energy-market analysis and producer perspectives on price stability, investment cycles and fiscal responses—issues with macroeconomic spillovers for many developing countries.  
- South Centre — An intergovernmental policy research centre of developing countries; provides synthesised policy research and advocacy that bridges technical analysis and political strategy for developing-country coalitions.  
- United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) — UN body producing trade and investment analysis; contributes to debates on capital flows, investment policies and the trade–development nexus.  
- United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) — Offers macroeconomic and development-policy analysis from a global, normative UN perspective; helps frame G-24 positions within broader UN policy agendas.  
- Central American Monetary Council — Regional monetary cooperation body; introduces perspectives on regional integration of monetary policy and coordination among small, open economies.

Interpretation and implications

- Outreach and agenda-shaping. The observer list demonstrates that G-24 is not an insular club but a convener that reaches across regions and specialised policy communities. This outreach allows the group to marshal technical analysis from UN agencies and regional bodies while remaining anchored to developing-country political priorities via the Group of 77 and the South Centre.  
- Energy and commodity salience. The presence of OPEC, the OPEC Fund, and oil-exporting state observers signals that commodity price dynamics and producer fiscal-management strategies are central to many G-24 discussions. For developing countries that are importers or rely on commodity revenues, these topics carry direct strategic and fiscal-security implications.  
- Technical depth and policy tools. UN agencies (UNCTAD, UN DESA, ILO, ECLAC) and regional monetary bodies bring specialized diagnostics—on trade, employment, macroeconomics and regional monetary coordination—that inform realistic policy options for developing-country delegates.  
- Coalition management and influence. Participation by the Group of 77 and the South Centre indicates deliberate coordination between G-24 technical stances and broader developing-country political positions in multilateral forums. Observer engagement therefore matters not only for expert input but for alliance formation and diplomatic signalling.  
- Limited formal power but meaningful influence. Observers do not change voting rights within G-24; their value is discursive and technical. They shape agendas, supply evidence, and create fora for aligning positions that G-24 members can carry into IMF/World Bank negotiations.

Important contextual notes for Indian strategic culture and national security policy

- The G-24 as a multilateral lever. The G-24 functions as a developing-country channel into IMF/World Bank policy debates on monetary, fiscal and development-finance issues. For Indian strategists, the group exemplifies how coalitional diplomacy—backed by technical argumentation—can advance national economic-security interests within larger multilateral institutions.  
- Observer identities shape expectations. Knowing who attends as observers is a practical forecasting tool: heavy representation from energy producers suggests sharper engagement on commodity volatility and fiscal buffers; a strong UN agency presence predicts detailed technical discussions on trade, social protection and employment. These expectations can guide New Delhi’s preparatory diplomacy and inter-agency briefings.  
- Policy uptake and cross-sectoral linkages. The observer mix highlights the interdisciplinary character of contemporary security: energy markets, development finance, and labour outcomes are intertwined with macro-stability and therefore with national security calculations (e.g., fiscal resilience, food/energy price shocks, social unrest risks). India’s strategic culture, which privileges non-military instruments of statecraft, can leverage G-24 inputs to strengthen economic resilience policies.  
- South–South and institution-building opportunities. Institutions like the Islamic Development Bank, the OPEC Fund, and the South Centre represent avenues for India to pursue alternative financing, technical partnerships and coordinated policy responses outside traditional Western-led channels. Engaging with these observers allows Indian policy-makers to diversify partnerships consistent with a pragmatic, interest-driven strategic posture.  
- Diplomatic signalling and alliance formation. Observer participation offers Indian diplomats a network to build coalitions around specific issues—reserve management, capital-flow measures, development finance reform—informing both bilateral ties (with Gulf producers, Indonesia, Angola) and multilateral bargaining positions.

Concluding remark

The G-24’s observer ecosystem is analytically illuminating: it reveals which technical resources and political interests flow into developing-country monetary and development-finance debates. For Indian strategic culture and national security policy, awareness of—and engagement with—this observer mix is a practical necessity. It enables more nuanced multilateral diplomacy, better anticipates agenda shifts (especially around energy and development finance), and helps convert technical expertise into strategic advantage.

## The Group of 24 (G‑24): Structure, Processes and Relevance to Indian Strategic Practice

The G‑24 is a unique multilateral forum for developing countries to coordinate positions on international monetary, financial and development issues. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the G‑24 merits attention not only as a technical venue for economic policy coordination but as an instrument of economic diplomacy that shapes India’s international positioning, capacity to influence global finance, and inter‑ministerial policy coherence.

### Dual‑level Organisation: Political and Operational

The G‑24 operates on two distinct but complementary levels.

- Political level: This is the visible, high‑politics tier in which Ministers (usually Finance Ministers or equivalent), their Deputies, members of the Bureau, and the Washington‑based representatives participate. Political actors set strategic direction, resolve political tradeoffs and ratify the group’s public output.
- Operational level: Day‑to‑day work is handled by the G‑24 Liaison Office, supported by a small Secretariat and a Research Coordinator. This level produces the technical analysis, drafts texts, prepares negotiation briefs and maintains institutional linkages—especially with the Bretton Woods institutions.

Understanding both levels is essential: Deputies and technical staff prepare the substantive work so that Ministers can focus on political endorsement; the Liaison Office ensures continuity and institutional access.

### Political Components and Meeting Procedures

Key political components and procedures include:

- Ministers and Deputies: Deputies serve as the principal preparatory body. They examine technical issues, negotiate drafts and resolve contentious technical points so that Ministers face a narrowed set of political choices. Ministers meet to provide final approval and political legitimacy to agreed positions.
- The Bureau: The Bureau manages internal coordination, prepares meeting agendas and handles procedural matters among members. In practice the Bureau’s role is to steer the group’s work program between plenaries.
- Washington‑based representatives: Maintaining embedded representation in Washington allows the G‑24 to follow developments at the IMF and World Bank closely and to engage their senior staff directly.
- Committee of the Whole and ad hoc meetings: At the political level participants use the Committee of the Whole for plenary deliberation and convene ad hoc meetings on specific issues requiring focused negotiation.

Timing and rhythm of meetings are deliberate: the G‑24 governing body meets twice a year—strategically scheduled ahead of the Spring and Fall meetings of the Bretton Woods committees (the International Monetary and Financial Committee, IMFC; and the Joint Development Committee of the World Bank and IMF). This sequencing permits the G‑24 to coordinate and consolidate member positions prior to the larger, higher‑visibility Bretton Woods deliberations.

Plenary sessions typically feature addresses by the heads of the IMF and the World Bank Group and by senior UN officials. Those engagements both signal the G‑24’s access to top international policymakers and provide members with direct channels for advocacy.

### From Deputies to Ministers: Producing a Communiqué

Decision‑making within the G‑24 follows a two‑stage trajectory:

1. Technical and substantive negotiation by Deputies (and expert working groups), who draft text and attempt to build consensus on technical issues.
2. Political endorsement by Ministers at the biannual ministerial meeting. Ministers approve a document that encapsulates the member countries’ consensus views.

The Ministerial outcome is published as a public Communiqué and presented at a press conference at the close of the meeting. These Communiqués serve a dual purpose: internally they record collective agreement among members; externally they signal the group’s unified stance to other international actors, the Bretton Woods institutions, and global media.

A key institutional norm is consensus decision‑making—there is no formal voting. Agreement by all members is required, which strengthens unified messaging but can constrain rapid or divergent policy responses.

### Operational Support: Liaison Office, Secretariat and Research Coordination

The G‑24’s operational apparatus is small but central to its effectiveness:

- G‑24 Liaison Office (Washington): Typically based in Washington to maintain close contact with IMF and World Bank processes, the Liaison Office performs continuous monitoring, facilitates consultations with Bretton Woods staff, and channels technical inputs between Washington and the political leadership of the G‑24.
- Secretariat and Research Coordinator: These actors produce the technical analysis that underpins policy positions, draft communiqués and briefing materials, and prepare Ministers and Deputies for negotiations. They also coordinate research work, synthesize member inputs and support capacity building in economic and financial policy analysis.
- Bureau functions: Beyond agenda‑setting, the Bureau facilitates intra‑group coordination, schedules meetings, and assists in procedural rulings during the negotiation process.

This operational level converts diverse national positions into coherent drafts and readies them for political consideration.

### Decision‑making by Consensus: Advantages and Limits

Consensus is a defining procedural choice that has important implications:

Advantages
- Produces strong, unified external messaging that enhances the group’s credibility before institutions like the IMF and World Bank.
- Encourages compromise and coalition‑building, strengthening collective bargaining power of developing countries.
- Helps align diverse member interests around shared economic and development objectives.

Limits
- Requires time and iterative negotiation, which can slow response in crises or on fast‑moving policy issues.
- Can mute more ambitious or divergent national stances in favour of lowest common denominator outcomes.
- Places high dependence on the technical preparatory work of Deputies and the Secretariat to reconcile differences before Ministerial meetings.

For India, these trade‑offs matter when assessing how the G‑24 can be used instrumentally—whether to project unified developing‑country positions or to preserve India’s strategic autonomy on economic policy.

### Strategic Significance for India’s National Security and Strategic Culture

While the G‑24 is not a security organisation per se, its role in global economic governance intersects directly with India’s strategic culture and national security policy in several ways:

- Economic diplomacy and influence: Participation allows India to shape global financial norms and policy debates that affect macroeconomic stability, development financing and the global economic environment—areas critical to national resilience.
- Access to Bretton Woods policymaking: The G‑24’s timing and Washington presence enable India to coordinate with other developing countries before IMFC and Joint Development Committee meetings, amplifying its voice in forums that influence conditionality, lending frameworks and systemic reform.
- Inter‑ministerial coherence: The Deputies–Ministers workflow fosters cooperation between India’s finance, planning and external affairs establishments, strengthening whole‑of‑government approaches to economic security.
- Signaling and legitimacy: Public Communiqués and high‑level exchanges with IMF/World Bank leadership provide India a platform to project policy priorities (e.g., sustainable development financing, reform of global financial architecture) and to frame issues in ways that align with its strategic narrative.
- Capacity building and technical engagement: Through the Secretariat and Research Coordinator interactions, India benefits from technical discourse and comparative policy knowledge, informing domestic economic policymaking that underpins long‑term security.

Thus the G‑24 functions as a tool of strategic engagement: it helps convert economic policy coordination into geopolitical influence while shaping the institutional context in which economic security is negotiated.

### Conclusion

The G‑24’s blended political‑operational structure—Ministers and Deputies backed by a Washington‑based Liaison Office, Secretariat and Research Coordinator—creates an institutional mechanism for developing countries to present coordinated positions to the Bretton Woods institutions. Its twice‑yearly ministerials, plenary addresses by IMF and World Bank heads, and public Communiqués maximize the group’s visibility and potential influence. For India, engagement with the G‑24 is both pragmatic and strategic: it is a venue for economic diplomacy that reinforces India’s capacity to shape global financial governance, align domestic policy with international norms, and integrate economic considerations into broader national security strategy.

### The Group of 24: Political Leadership and Strategic Significance for India

This short administrative passage identifies the political leadership of the Group of 24 (G‑24) by name, ministerial office and country. Although brief, the composition and level of the leaders named offer important cues about the character and leverage of the G‑24 as a coordination mechanism for developing countries in major international financial forums. Below I contextualize the information, explain the formal roles implied by the offices, and draw out the relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

Current political leadership (as reported)
- Chair: Adama Coulibaly — Minister of Finance, Côte d’Ivoire  
- First Vice‑Chair: Benjamin E. Diokno — Secretary of Finance, Philippines  
- Second Vice‑Chair: Sergio Massa — Minister of Treasury, Argentina

What these offices mean in practice
- Chair: The Chair of the G‑24 normally presides over internal meetings, sets (or heavily influences) the agenda during its tenure, and represents the group externally—most importantly in encounters with the IMF and World Bank. The Chair therefore acts as the public face and principal coordinator of the G‑24’s collective positions.
- Vice‑Chairs: The First and Second Vice‑Chairs support the Chair, take on delegated responsibilities, and stand in for the Chair when required. They facilitate consensus-building across the membership and ensure continuity of representation across regions and time zones.
- Ministerial level: All three named leaders are senior finance officials. That ministerial-level representation signals that the G‑24 operates at the highest policy levels of governments rather than as a technocratic or purely academic forum. It amplifies the group’s ability to influence negotiations at the IMF and World Bank.

Why the leadership composition matters
- Geographic diversity: The Chair and Vice‑Chairs come from Africa (Côte d’Ivoire), Asia (Philippines) and Latin America (Argentina), reflecting the G‑24’s cross‑regional mandate to represent developing-country perspectives. Such diversity bolsters the claim that G‑24 positions aggregate broad Global South interests rather than narrow regional agendas.
- Policy focus implied: Because these officials are finance ministers/secretaries, the emphasis of the group remains fiscal and macroeconomic—debt treatment, access to finance, conditionality, architecture reform at the IMF/World Bank, allocation of SDRs, crisis response and similar items.
- Political weight: Ministerial leadership increases the G‑24’s ability to coordinate unified positions and to carry political authority into multilateral negotiations.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Economic security as strategic priority: For India, engagement in the G‑24 aligns with an understanding of national security that includes economic resilience. Collective bargaining through the G‑24 can help shape IMF/World Bank norms on lending conditions, debt restructuring, and climate finance—areas that directly affect India’s fiscal space and policy autonomy.
- Multilateral coalition-building: India’s participation in ministerial‑level groupings such as the G‑24 exemplifies a deliberate strategy of coalition diplomacy. Working with a geographically diverse leadership strengthens India’s ability to amplify Global South voices on governance reforms of the international financial architecture.
- Leverage in crisis and reform moments: When global shocks (pandemics, commodity price spikes, financial contagion) pressure developing economies, India benefits from coordinated positions on SDR allocation, suspension of debt service, or concessional financing. The ministerial leadership named above shapes those bargaining positions.
- Soft power and leadership projection: India's interaction with rotating chairs and vice‑chairs can be a platform for projecting policy ideas and building reciprocal support in other forums (UN, G20, regional institutions). Ministerial engagement signals seriousness and commitment to shared Global South priorities.

Limitations of the passage and additional context required
- Missing temporal and procedural information: The brief list omits term dates, the length of the leadership mandate, and the selection/rotation rules that govern Chair and Vice‑Chair appointments. Those procedural details matter for assessing continuity, agenda ownership, and the predictability of the G‑24’s policy line.
- Absent agenda priorities: The passage does not enumerate the G‑24’s working priorities during the named leadership. For strategic assessment, one needs to know whether the group is prioritizing debt restructuring mechanics, IMF quota reform, climate finance linkages, or pandemic recovery measures.
- Internal dynamics and membership composition: Understanding how consensus is achieved in the G‑24—voting rules, working groups, the role of technical experts—would clarify how ministerial statements translate into negotiation positions within the IMF/World Bank.

Concluding assessment
Even a terse roster of names and offices conveys meaningful signals. The G‑24’s leadership at ministerial level, and its cross‑regional composition, confirm the group’s role as a politically weighty aggregator of developing‑country views in international financial governance. For India, this matters substantively: engagement through the G‑24 advances economic security objectives, supports coalition diplomacy, and provides a strategic avenue to influence reforms of the global financial architecture that bear directly on India’s national security calculus. To deepen analysis, the roster should be supplemented with term dates, selection rules and the G‑24’s agenda under the current leadership.

## Secretariat

The G-24 Secretariat is the permanent administrative organ that underpins the Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs and Development. Established as a stable institutional locus for the G-24's activities, the Secretariat performs a mix of administrative, research and diplomatic functions that sustain the group's collective voice in global economic governance.

Location and institutional proximity
- The Secretariat is based in Washington, D.C., housed within the premises of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Headquarters. This physical proximity to major international financial institutions affords the Secretariat ready access to information flows, convening opportunities and informal channels of engagement with IMF staff and other resident organizations.

Core functions
- Liaison and consensus facilitation: The Secretariat’s primary role is to ensure effective liaison among G-24 members, helping to distill national positions into coherent, collective stances on shared issues of international monetary and development policy. This consensus function is central to the G-24’s ability to act as a unified interlocutor for developing countries.
- Program implementation and oversight: The Secretariat oversees and implements the G-24 work program—organizing meetings, coordinating inputs, tracking deliverables and ensuring continuity across annual cycles.
- Coalition-building and external engagement: A deliberate task of the Secretariat is to build strategic partnerships and coalitions with other forums and actors (including the IMF, World Bank, regional bodies and like-minded coalitions) to amplify the policy influence of G-24 positions.
- Support to leadership: The Secretariat provides logistical, secretarial and substantive support to the Chair and the Bureau, enabling agenda-setting, meeting continuity and the procedural mechanics of multilateral negotiation.

Research and the 1997 institutional consolidation
- Until 1997, the G-24’s operational coordination of members’ policy positions rested substantively with a separate Research Program. That program, led by a Research Coordinator, produced technical policy outputs that informed the group’s advocacy.
- In 1997 the Secretariat was formalized and the Research Program was absorbed into its organizational structure. This centralization of administrative and research functions increased institutional continuity, expanded analytic capacity and created a clearer technical-policy axis within the Secretariat.
- The Director of the Secretariat, since the 1997 reorganization, has also managed the Research Program. The combined role institutionalizes a single managerial hierarchy responsible for both secretarial continuity and the production of policy analysis.

Notable research coordinators and technical leadership
- The Research Program historically attracted recognized policy scholars and economists, underscoring the Secretariat’s role as a producer of policy-relevant research for developing-country perspectives. Notable figures include:
  - Sidney S. Dell (British), Research Coordinator, 1975–1990.
  - Gary Helleiner (Canada), Research Coordinator, 1990–1997.
  - Dani Rodrik (Turkish economist), served as Research Coordinator (noted in the Secretariat’s post-absorption period, active around 2002).
  - Jomo Sundaram (Malaysian economist), Research Coordinator, 2006–2012.
- The participation of such scholars signals the Secretariat’s engagement with influential economic thought and its capacity to translate technical analysis into collective policy prescriptions.

Directors of the Secretariat (selected chronology)
- The Secretariat has been led by a succession of Directors who, post-1997, have carried responsibility for both administration and the Research Program. A concise list (years and available country attribution) follows:
  - 1997: Aziz Ali Mohammed (country not specified in the source text; verification recommended)
  - 2000–2002: William Larralde (Venezuela)
  - 2002–2007: Ariel Buira (Mexico)
  - 2007–2014: Amar Bhattacharya (country not specified in the source text; verification recommended)
  - 2014–2023: Marilou Uy (Philippines)
  - 2023–present: Iyabo Masha (Nigeria)
- Note: where country attribution is absent in the source material, researchers should confirm biographical details from primary sources.

Implications for stakeholders and Indian strategic concerns
- Member states: For G-24 members, including India, the Secretariat is the operational backbone that translates national priorities into coordinated positions. India relies on the Secretariat for research inputs, meeting logistics and the procedural know-how needed to pursue collective negotiating strategies.
- External partners and institutions: The Secretariat functions as a stable interlocutor for external actors (IMF, World Bank, regional development banks and other multilateral fora), making it a focal point for coalition-building and diplomacy on issues where economic and financial governance intersect.
- Research and policy communities: The absorbed Research Program provides a platform for generating policy analysis that reflects developing-country perspectives on international monetary issues—material that can influence India's macroeconomic diplomacy and narrative framing in multilateral settings.
- National security and strategic culture: Economic policy and financial stability are integral components of national security. The Secretariat’s role in shaping global rules, resource allocations and crisis management frameworks therefore has direct implications for India’s strategic calculations. Through coordinated G-24 engagement—supported by Secretariat analysis and convening—the Indian state can pursue policies that protect macroeconomic resilience, safeguard development finance, and influence norms in ways that buttress long-term strategic autonomy.

Institutional strengths and limits
- Strengths: Formalization in 1997 enhanced continuity, centralized expertise and increased the Secretariat’s capacity to sustain long-term analytical projects and diplomatic outreach. Presence at the IMF sharpens the Secretariat’s access to realtime policy debates and technical resources.
- Limits and caveats: The Secretariat’s influence ultimately depends on member cohesion and the political will of leading capitals. Gaps in publicly available biographical data on some Directors point to a need for careful archival work when assessing personnel-driven continuity or change.

Conclusion
The G-24 Secretariat is more than an administrative office: it is the technical and convening engine that transforms heterogeneous developing-country interests into coherent policy positions in international financial governance. For India, mastery of Secretariat-mediated processes—both as a member and as a contributor to the Research Program—constitutes an important element of economic statecraft that dovetails with the country’s broader strategic culture and national security priorities.

- 2019 — Peru  
- 2020 — Ghana  
- 2021 — Iran  
- 2022 — Guatemala  
- 2023 — Côte d’Ivoire

Time coverage: this is an uninterrupted, annual sequence covering 19 consecutive years (2005–2023). No country repeats in this interval; each year a different developing country assumed the Chair.

Role and the organisation in brief
- Nature of G‑24: The G‑24 is an intergovernmental coordination group of developing countries focused on international monetary affairs and development finance. It seeks to harmonize member positions and to influence debates in the IMF, World Bank and other international financial fora.
- Role of the Chair: The Chair organises and leads G‑24 meetings, helps set the group’s agenda for the year, shapes the drafting and endorsement of joint statements, and represents the G‑24 in formal and informal interactions with other international institutions and donor constituencies. The office is thus both procedural (secretariat-like functions) and political (agenda‑shaping and external representation).

Statistical summary and regional composition
- Total entries: 19  
- Unique countries: 19 (no repeats in 2005–2023)  
- Regional counts (aggregation used in this analysis):  
  - Africa: 7  
  - Latin America & Caribbean: 6  
  - Asia: 3  
  - Middle East: 3

Notable patterns and observations
- Africa’s prominence: African states chaired the group most often in this period (7 of 19), indicating robust African engagement with the G‑24’s agenda and an emphasis on African priorities within the developing‑country coordination framework.
- Strong Latin American representation: Six chairs from Latin America and the Caribbean demonstrates the region’s sustained investment in collective positioning on international finance.
- Broad geographic spread: Chairs were drawn from Africa, LAC, Asia and the Middle East, reflecting the G‑24’s deliberate geographical diversity and its attempt to reflect a plurality of developing‑country interests.
- Annual rotation and equity: The single‑year, non‑repeating rotation observed here underscores procedural stability and a norm of sharing leadership — a mechanism that both distributes influence and allows varied national perspectives to shape the group’s output year by year.

Practical uses of the list
- Tracking leadership: The list is useful for tracing which developing‑country constituencies held agenda control in given years and for mapping temporal shifts in regional emphasis.
- Assessing influence: Changes in the Chair can signal different substantive priorities (for example, a country with strong interests in commodity markets versus one focusing on debt sustainability), which in turn affects the G‑24’s negotiating posture in global institutions.
- Research tool: Scholars can use the sequence to correlate Chairmanship with issued communiqués, policy initiatives, or institutional outreach undertaken by the G‑24 in particular years.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Symbolic and material significance of chairing (2012): India’s Chairmanship in 2012 is both a marker of its standing among developing countries and an instrument of strategic economic diplomacy. Leading the G‑24 enabled India to foreground development‑finance issues aligned with its priorities (for example, concessional finance, reform of international financial institutions, or South–South cooperation).
- Leverage in multilateral economic governance: Occupying the Chair allowed India to shape collective developing‑country messaging in key international financial forums, reinforcing its preference for negotiated reform and multilateral engagement rather than unilateralism — a recurrent feature of India’s strategic culture.
- Economic security as national security: Given the G‑24’s focus, leadership is directly relevant to India’s conception of national security, which increasingly integrates economic resilience, access to development finance, and favourable global governance as components of strategic autonomy.
- Soft power and normative leadership: Chairing provided India with an opportunity to exercise normative influence — to articulate principles (equity in governance, voice for the Global South) and to build coalitions that serve longer‑term strategic goals, including enhanced diplomatic capital in other multilateral settings.

Concise conclusion
This annual listing of G‑24 Chairs (2005–2023) presents a straightforward record of rotating leadership among developing countries, revealing both procedural equity and a regional distribution tilted toward Africa and Latin America. For India, the 2012 Chairmanship fits coherently with its strategic practice of leveraging multilateral institutions to advance development finance agendas that underpin broader national security and geopolitical objectives.

## The G‑24’s Research Program and Its Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

The Group of 24 (G‑24) functions as the principal coordination mechanism through which developing countries formulate common positions on international monetary and development policy. Its research and work program — expressly targeted at the policy needs of developing and emerging economies — supplies the empirical evidence, analytical frameworks and policy options that underpin the G‑24’s negotiating stances in multilateral fora such as the IMF, World Bank and the G20. For India, which blends a tradition of strategic autonomy with an increasing willingness to shape global governance, the G‑24’s outputs are consequential: they inform India’s economic diplomacy, reinforce its national economic security objectives, and link domestic development priorities to debates about the rules of the global economy.

Below I set out the Group’s three thematic research pillars, explain their constituent elements, and indicate why each is salient to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Global economy and the growth agenda
- Core focus: structural transformation, trade and technology, and inequality.
- Structural transformation: research emphasizes the policies required to shift economies from low‑productivity, subsistence activities into higher‑productivity manufacturing and services — a concern central to employment creation, fiscal capacity and long‑term resilience. For India this analysis intersects with industrial policy initiatives (e.g., “Make in India”, Atmanirbhar Bharat), labour‑market reform debates and strategies for generating productive jobs while avoiding premature deindustrialization.
- Trade and technology: the program examines how trade policy, technology diffusion, and the governance of digital and critical technologies affect growth prospects. Topics include technology transfer, trade facilitation, supply‑chain resilience, and rules emerging at the WTO and plurilateral fora. These questions are strategic for India as it negotiates market access, protects nascent technological capabilities, and balances openness with the need to safeguard critical infrastructure and data.
- Inequality: research connects distributional dynamics to growth sustainability and social stability. Inequality‑focused work links directly to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to national security concerns: high and rising inequality can fuel social unrest and reduce the legitimacy of state institutions. For Indian policymakers, evidence on the growth‑inequality nexus informs fiscal redistribution, social safety nets, and policies that aim to combine inclusion with competitive growth.

2. International financial architecture
- Core focus: reform and governance of global financial institutions; the global financial safety net and crisis prevention; and financial regulation.
- Reform and governance of international institutions: the G‑24 addresses IMF quota reform, voice and representation of developing countries, and broader governance reforms of MDBs. These debates matter to India’s strategic aims of achieving greater influence commensurate with its economic weight and of ensuring that global institutions reflect developing countries’ experiences and priorities.
- Global financial safety net and crisis management: the program analyzes the design and adequacy of international liquidity mechanisms — including the IMF, regional financing arrangements, and the role of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) — as well as crisis‑prevention frameworks. For India, robust safety nets and clearer rules for crisis resolution reduce systemic spillovers and protect macroeconomic stability, which are essential to national security and policy autonomy.
- Managing capital flows: research examines capital‑flow volatility, macroprudential tools, and the trade‑offs of capital account liberalization. Indian strategic culture—cautious about rapid and volatile capital flows—has historically favored calibrated capital‑flow management and monetary‑fiscal policy buffers; G‑24 work provides evidence on best practices for sequencing liberalization while preserving stability.
- Financial regulation: work on micro‑ and macroprudential regulation, cross‑border supervision, and crisis resolution informs how countries should regulate banking sectors, non‑bank finance and emergent areas such as fintech. For India, robust regulatory frameworks protect financial stability, preserve consumer protection, and enable innovation in payments and credit without undermining systemic safety.

3. Financing for development
- Core focus: taxation and international tax cooperation; infrastructure financing; debt management and sustainability; and financial inclusion.
- Taxation and international tax cooperation: the G‑24 researches revenue mobilization, international tax rules (including BEPS issues and the architecture for a global minimum tax), and automatic information exchange. For India, strengthening domestic tax capacity and shaping rules on profit allocation and taxation of the digital economy are crucial for fiscal sovereignty and financing public goods central to national security (health, defence‑supporting infrastructure, social resilience).
- Infrastructure financing: work covers public‑private partnerships, efficiency of capital allocation, blended finance, and MDB financing instruments needed to close the infrastructure gap. India’s strategic priorities — transport corridors, energy security, ports and digital infrastructure — rely on sustainable, scalable financing solutions that the G‑24 evaluates and recommends.
- Debt management and sustainability: research addresses sovereign debt vulnerabilities, restructuring mechanisms, sustainability analysis and creditor coordination. Given regional exposures and the possibility of external shocks, the design of credible restructuring frameworks and prudent borrowing strategies are matters of economic security for India and for countries in its periphery.
- Financial inclusion: analysis spans access to banking services, digital financial infrastructure, regulation for consumer protection, and the role of digital ID systems. India’s own initiatives (e.g., Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar, UPI) illustrate how financial inclusion advances both development and resilience; the G‑24’s comparative work helps calibrate policy trade‑offs between rapid inclusion and stability risks.

Research outputs, dissemination and policy uptake
- The G‑24 produces books, policy briefs, working papers and background studies; these are published and made available through its website. This repository functions as a practical toolkit for policymakers, negotiators and researchers seeking evidence and policy recommendations tailored to developing‑country circumstances.
- India leverages these outputs in multiple ways: informing negotiating positions in the IMF/World Bank/G20, shaping bilateral and South–South technical cooperation, and adapting international best practices to domestic policy design. The credibility of G‑24 research strengthens India’s capacity to argue for reforms that preserve developmental policy space and advance inclusive, stable growth.

Conclusion: strategic implications for India
- The G‑24’s research agenda sits at the intersection of development policy and international economic governance. For India’s strategic culture—which privileges economic sovereignty, pragmatic multilateralism and a long‑term view of national resilience—the Group’s analytical products are both intellectual resources and diplomatic instruments.
- By informing policy on structural transformation, financial architecture, and development financing, G‑24 work helps India pursue an integrated security strategy in which economic stability, fiscal capacity, and equitable growth are treated as core elements of national security.
