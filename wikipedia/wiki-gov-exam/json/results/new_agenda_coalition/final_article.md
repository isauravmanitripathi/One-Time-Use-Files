### New Agenda Coalition (NAC)

Background and membership  
The New Agenda Coalition (NAC) is an informal, cross‑regional grouping founded in 1998 and composed of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand and South Africa. Unlike a formal international organization, the NAC operates as a diplomatic coalition: it does not possess institutional permanence or secretariat infrastructure but instead functions through coordinated positions and joint initiatives in multilateral fora — above all the nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review process.

Political character and strategy: middle powers and norm entrepreneurship  
The NAC’s members are best characterised as middle powers. They lack the high‑end military capabilities of major powers but exercise disproportionate influence through sustained diplomacy, coalition‑building and normative leadership. The NAC exemplifies middle‑power behaviour: using expertise, moral authority and procedural leverage to shape agendas, draft text, and broker compromises. Rather than coercive instruments, the coalition deploys persuasion, technical proposals and the legitimacy that accrues from cross‑regional membership.

Primary aim and policy focus  
The NAC’s central aim is to build an international consensus and political momentum for measurable progress on nuclear disarmament. It links this advocacy directly to states’ legal obligations under the NPT, principally Article VI, which requires parties to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures leading to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament. In practice, the NAC presses for concrete, multilateral measures that translate the abstract obligation of Article VI into verifiable policy steps.

Tactical content of NAC proposals  
Across NPT Preparatory Committees and Review Conferences the NAC has consistently promoted a set of practical criteria for disarmament measures: verifiable, irreversible and time‑bound (VIR) steps. Its diplomacy has favoured sequential, measurable actions — such as verified reductions, strengthened verification regimes and negotiated timelines — rather than open‑ended commitments. The coalition’s most notable early success was the formulation and promotion of a substantive package of practical steps that influenced the outcome of the 2000 NPT Review Conference.

Role in NPT machinery and multilateral diplomacy  
The NAC is principally active at NPT Review Conferences and their Preparatory Committees, where its cross‑regional voice is used to shape draft language, build vote blocs and press for operational commitments from nuclear‑armed states. Because it does not represent a single region or geopolitical bloc, the NAC has been adept at reframing disarmament debates away from binary East–West or North–South oppositions and toward global normative obligations and practical measures.

Legitimacy through cross‑regional composition  
The coalition’s membership spans Latin America (Brazil, Mexico), Africa (Egypt, South Africa), Europe (Ireland) and Oceania (New Zealand). This geographic dispersion is intentional: it seeks to enhance the perceived neutrality and universality of the coalition’s proposals, reduce the risk that disarmament debates become framed in polarising geopolitical terms, and increase moral and diplomatic pressure on nuclear‑armed states to translate disarmament rhetoric into concrete action.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
For a state like India — a nuclear‑armed country that is not a party to the NPT and that places a high value on strategic autonomy — the NAC presents both normative pressure and diplomatic opportunity. The coalition’s insistence on verifiable, irreversible and time‑bound measures speaks to universal disarmament goals that India publicly endorses; yet the NAC’s NPT‑centred strategy is anchored in an institutional framework India regards as discriminatory in its present application. As a result:

- NAC advocacy contributes to the international normative environment that shapes expectations of responsible nuclear stewardship. That environment affects India’s diplomatic calculations and its efforts to legitimise its nuclear status on non‑discriminatory grounds.
- India’s strategic culture — which prizes autonomy, deterrence, and equilibrium in South Asia — leads it to be cautious about externally driven timelines or measures perceived as privileging certain states or imposing verification regimes misaligned with its security concerns.
- Opportunities for convergence exist in areas where NAC proposals address universal, technical, and confidence‑building measures (e.g., stronger verification technologies, nuclear risk reduction) rather than unilateral disarmament demands. Engagement with middle powers in the NAC can therefore be transactional: India may find common cause on practical transparency and risk‑reduction initiatives while rejecting frameworks that it views as legally or politically skewed.

Conclusion  
The New Agenda Coalition illustrates how middle powers can aggregate influence through informal, cross‑regional diplomacy to press for concrete implementation of NPT Article VI. Its emphasis on verifiable, irreversible and time‑bound steps, and its strategic use of the NPT review process, have helped to set the terms of multilateral disarmament debates. For India, the NAC’s agenda forms part of the broader normative and diplomatic milieu shaping expectations about nuclear behaviour — a milieu India navigates by balancing commitment to the goal of universal disarmament with its insistence on strategic autonomy, non‑discrimination and security‑sensitive sequencing of any obligations.

### The New Agenda Coalition (NAC): Origins, Aims and Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture

The New Agenda Coalition (NAC) is a paradigmatic example of middle‑power diplomacy aimed at reshaping nuclear norms in the wake of perceived stagnation within the Treaty on the Non‑Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) framework. Formally launched in Dublin in June 1998, the NAC crystallized a trans‑regional, normative response to the North–South divide and to the contentious 1995 decision to grant the NPT an indefinite extension. Its founding statement—an 18‑point declaration entitled “A Nuclear‑Weapons‑Free World: The Need for a New Agenda,” signed on 9 June 1998 by the foreign ministers of Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and Slovenia—placed nuclear abolition at the center of a new foreign‑policy agenda and explicitly tied that goal to perceived failures by nuclear‑weapon states to honour Article VI of the NPT.

Origins and context
- The immediate political context for the NAC was a deepening North–South schism in NPT-related diplomacy. Many non‑nuclear‑weapon states (especially from the developing world) contended that the indefinite extension of the NPT in 1995 had magnified the treaty’s discriminatory character: nuclear‑weapon states (NWS) retained their arsenals without delivering credible, time‑bound progress on disarmament. This grievance was framed legally and politically around Article VI of the NPT, which obliges parties to “pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race and to nuclear disarmament.”
- The NAC was therefore formed as a corrective: a coalition of middle powers pressing a normative, diplomatic agenda to convert Article VI’s aspirational phrasing into concrete international pressure for abolition. Its creation occurred against the immediate backdrop of the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan in May 1998—events the NAC’s declaration explicitly cited as demonstrating the urgency of a renewed international effort.

Launch, membership and declaration
- The NAC was launched in Dublin (June 1998) and accompanied by the 18‑point Joint Declaration. The signatories—Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Sweden and Slovenia—presented a coordinated diplomatic push for a “Nuclear Free World Policy,” arguing that elimination of nuclear weapons was both a logical extension of the NPT and a political necessity to reduce the risks of use, threat and proliferation.
- The opening lines of the declaration stressed the continued danger from the indefinite possession of nuclear weapons by the NWS as well as from nuclear‑capable states that had not acceded to the NPT—referring, in 1998 terms, to India, Pakistan and Israel. The recent tests by India and Pakistan were invoked as immediate evidence that the existing arrangements were failing to prevent proliferation and escalation.
- Sweden and Slovenia subsequently left the coalition, but the NAC’s founding conception and its 18‑point declaration remain the touchstone for understanding the coalition’s objectives and rhetoric.

Normative framing and political strategy
- The NAC’s principal instrument was normative pressure: it sought to stigmatize nuclear weapons morally and legally, to build international consensus for disarmament steps, and to mobilize diplomatic leverage on the NWS through coalition‑building among non‑nuclear states. It was explicitly not a coercive or military initiative; it had no enforcement tools and no participation from declared nuclear‑armed states.
- This middle‑power strategy has two implications. First, it amplifies global normative discourse—shaping debates in NPT review conferences and creating political cost for those seen as obstructing disarmament. Second, its lack of nuclear‑armed participants limits direct leverage on implementation: the NAC could press for commitments and verification, but it could not compel the NWS to surrender arsenals or to accept timelines.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- For India, the NAC presented a normative challenge rather than an immediate coercive threat. India—having never acceded to the NPT on grounds of discrimination and security realism—justified nuclear acquisition through strategic imperatives: regional rivalry (notably with Pakistan and China), the perceived inadequacies of international security guarantees, and the insistence on strategic autonomy.
- The NAC’s emphatic linking of the NPT’s legitimacy to disarmament under Article VI implicitly questioned the legitimacy of states remaining outside the treaty. By pointing to the May 1998 tests by India and Pakistan, the NAC’s declaration contributed to an international environment that treated both tests as evidence of proliferation risk and as a reason to press for stronger normative constraints.
- Practically, however, the NAC had limited capacity to change India’s threat perceptions or its strategic posture. India’s nuclear policy is embedded in a security doctrine that prioritizes deterrence, credibility, and control over escalation—considerations not readily altered by moral suasion alone. The NAC’s normative pressure did, however, contribute to international stigmatization of overt testing and provided a multilateral platform from which non‑nuclear states could press for disarmament commitments from the NWS.
- Over the longer term, persistent normative campaigns of the kind the NAC advanced helped shape the diplomatic context in which India later pursued selective engagement with non‑proliferation regimes (for example, the political negotiations that preceded the Indo‑US nuclear agreement of 2005). The NAC thus affected the reputational and diplomatic terrain, even where it did not directly alter India’s core strategic calculations.

Assessment and legacy
- The NAC exemplifies how middle powers can seek to reframe global security debates by converting legal obligations (Article VI) into political pressure for normative change. It responded to structural grievances arising from the 1995 NPT extension and the North–South divide, and it leveraged the symbolic power of the May 1998 tests to demand a new agenda.
- Its limitations are equally instructive: without the participation of declared nuclear states, and lacking enforcement mechanisms, the NAC’s influence was largely moral and diplomatic. For India, the coalition reinforced the international costs of testing and of non‑accession to the NPT, but it did not fundamentally undermine the strategic conditions—regional rivalry, credibility, and autonomy—that underpin India’s nuclear posture.
- In sum, the NAC altered the normative environment and amplified demands for disarmament, but the translation of those demands into changes in state behaviour (including India’s) depended on broader shifts in security dynamics, reciprocity from nuclear states, and concrete verification and enforcement mechanisms—none of which the NAC, by itself, could provide.

### New Agenda Coalition Map
(Original sources typically include a world map highlighting member states to emphasize the coalition’s geographic spread. Such a graphic is useful in quickly conveying that the New Agenda Coalition (NAC) was not a regional grouping but a cross‑regional, like‑minded platform.)

The New Agenda Coalition consists of six states:

- Brazil (Latin America)  
- Egypt (Africa / Middle East)  
- Ireland (Europe)  
- Mexico (Latin America)  
- New Zealand (Oceania)  
- South Africa (Africa)

All six members are non‑nuclear‑weapon states under the Treaty on the Non‑Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Their coalition, formed in 1998 around the declaration A New Agenda for Nuclear Disarmament, was designed to press for concrete, verifiable steps toward the elimination of nuclear weapons within the NPT framework.

Analytically important features of this membership list
- Cross‑regional composition: The members span Latin America, Africa, Europe and Oceania. This geographic reach was deliberate — it signalled that nuclear disarmament was not the preserve of one region but a global priority backed by diverse regional voices.  
- NPT identity: By comprising only NPT non‑nuclear‑weapon states, the NAC positioned itself as a normative coalition of states advocating that those without nuclear arms push the disarmament agenda within the Treaty’s structures.  
- Practical influence: The NAC’s proposals and joint statements have shaped debates at NPT Review Conferences and in UN disarmament fora by arguing for specific, time‑bound measures (e.g., reductions, transparency, verification mechanisms) rather than vague commitments.

Relevance for an Indian strategic‑culture perspective
- India is not a member of the NAC — and for important reasons tied to its strategic culture. India remains outside the NPT as a nuclear‑armed state and therefore does not participate in coalitions whose leverage is premised on non‑possession under the Treaty.  
- The NAC’s normative pressure for elimination and its emphasis on universal, multilateral measures nonetheless affect the international environment in which India fashions its nuclear doctrine and diplomacy. India watches NAC initiatives closely because they influence NPT review outcomes, UN resolutions and the broader normative climate concerning disarmament, verification and non‑proliferation.  
- For Indian policymakers, the NAC represents both an opportunity and a challenge: its goals overlap with India’s stated long‑term aspiration for a nuclear‑weapon‑free world, but its immediate prescriptions — framed from the position of NPT non‑nuclear states — can appear to sidestep the security and verification concerns India insists must be resolved before disarmament pathways can be realistically pursued.

New Agenda Coalition and the 2000 NPT breakthrough: substance and significance
- Origin and membership. The New Agenda Coalition (NAC) emerged in the late 1990s as a cross‑regional grouping of non‑nuclear and middle powers that sought to re‑energize stalled nuclear disarmament diplomacy. Commonly cited founding members are Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden. The NAC’s formation reflected a shared conviction that incremental, practical steps could break the deadlock between nuclear‑armed and non‑nuclear states under the Treaty on the Non‑Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
- The 2000 NPT Review Conference. Entering the 2000 Review Conference, prospects for substantive agreement appeared poor. The NAC played a decisive diplomatic role in negotiating what became the ‘‘13 Steps’’ (also styled the ‘‘Practical Steps’’) — a package of commitments addressing Article VI obligations. The agreement represented the most concrete set of disarmament commitments obtained at an NPT review up to that point, and it shifted the tone of multilateral nuclear diplomacy from abstract exhortation to a program of measures.
- Core content of the 13 Steps. The Steps reaffirmed that Article VI requires negotiations on nuclear disarmament and on ‘‘general and complete disarmament’’ while also emphasizing that measures specific to nuclear disarmament can proceed independently of a comprehensive general disarmament treaty. They included, inter alia, commitments to pursue systematic and progressive efforts toward nuclear disarmament, enhanced transparency and reductions in nuclear arsenals, strengthened safeguards and verification measures, and steps to reduce the role and salience of nuclear weapons in security doctrines.
- The ‘‘unequivocal undertaking’’ and practical ambition. One notable formulation in the 2000 outcome was a press for ‘‘an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear‑weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals’’ — an explicit political aspiration that, while not a legally binding timetable, established a normative reference point. The NAC framed the 13 Steps as practical, verifiable and irreversible measures designed to produce tangible progress rather than to postpone action pending wider disarmament.

Continuity of NAC activity and institutional channels
- Annual UN First Committee engagement. After 2000 the NAC translated its diplomatic breakthrough into sustained multilateral advocacy. It began submitting an annual resolution on disarmament and non‑proliferation to the UN General Assembly First Committee (Disarmament and International Security), a forum that deliberates arms control and disarmament issues. These NAC resolutions have, historically, attracted overwhelming support in the First Committee, signalling broad normative resonance among UN member states.
- Position papers and NPT preparatory work. The NAC has also remained active in NPT intersessional work, submitting position papers to review and preparatory meetings and using those fora to defend and elaborate the Practical Steps. This sustained presence helped preserve the 2000 package as a reference point for subsequent review cycles.

The humanitarian turn and links to the TPNW process
- Humanitarian Initiative and normative evolution. Beginning in 2013 a parallel diplomatic current — the Humanitarian Initiative — reframed nuclear weapons debates around the catastrophic human and environmental consequences of nuclear detonations. All current NAC members have participated in this humanitarian diplomacy, which contributed intellectual and political momentum to the later negotiations that produced the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW).
- From practical steps to prohibition? The Humanitarian Initiative did not supplant the NAC’s pragmatic emphasis on step‑by‑step disarmament; rather, it introduced new normative arguments and political levers that complicated the policy environment, especially for nuclear‑armed states resistant to rapid elimination. The synergy and tensions between ‘‘practical’’ stepwise approaches and prohibitionist humanitarianism have been a defining feature of the post‑2000 disarmament landscape.

Constraints and contestation
- Political resistance and substantive objections. Implementation of the 13 Steps has been constrained by predictable political objections from some nuclear‑weapon states. Key areas of contention include sequencing (the order in which reductions and security guarantees should occur), rigorous verification and the perceived need to preserve minimum deterrence during transition. These security‑centric objections have limited the pace and scope of verifiable, irreversible disarmament measures.
- Verification, transparency and irreversibility. The 13 Steps placed emphasis on measures that are verifiable and irreversible, but technical and political disputes over verification standards, the intrusiveness of inspections, and dual‑use ambiguities have slowed progress. These contested issues remain central to any practical implementation strategy.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy orientation
- Normative pressure and strategic calculations. For a state like India — a non‑party to the NPT with a strategic culture that prioritizes credible nuclear deterrence and regional security imperatives — the NAC’s achievements and the humanitarian discourse represent both a normative challenge and a diplomatic opportunity. While India has traditionally stressed non‑discriminatory approaches to non‑proliferation and a connection between disarmament and wider security arrangements, the international salience of practical steps and humanitarian arguments affects the expectations that New Delhi must navigate in multilateral diplomacy.
- Policy posture. The NAC/13 Steps narrative underscores an enduring policy dilemma in Indian strategic thought: how to reconcile principled support for nuclear risk‑reduction and non‑proliferation with a security doctrine that regards nuclear weapons as an instrument of deterrence and strategic autonomy. The practical‑vs‑prohibitionist divide evident in global diplomacy has therefore shaped India’s selective engagement with disarmament fora and its emphasis on verification, equity and security guarantees.
