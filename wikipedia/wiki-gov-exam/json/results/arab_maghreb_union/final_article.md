## The Frozen Maghreb: The Arab Maghreb Union’s Paralysis and Lessons for Regional Strategy

This section examines the prolonged dysfunction of the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU) — the supranational framework intended to bind the five North African states — and extracts the institutional and strategic lessons relevant to India’s approach to regional organisation, crisis management, and national security policy. The AMU case illustrates how unresolved territorial disputes, bilateral rivalries, and weaknesses in governance rules can transform an integration project into an instrument of competition rather than cooperation.

### 1. Chronology and critical episodes (1990s–2025)

- 1994: Algeria attempted to transfer the AMU presidency to Libya during a period of heightened tension with Morocco and Libya. The move became a flashpoint: Morocco and Libya repeatedly refused to attend AMU meetings in Algiers, creating procedural and legitimacy problems for the Union.
- Algeria invoked the AMU Constitutive Act (which prescribes annual rotation of the presidency) to justify the transfer. Although Algeria agreed to assume the presidency from Tunisia in 1994, it could not effect a formal handover because the conditions specified in the Act were not met when key parties boycotted the proceedings.
- Muammar Gaddafi’s response — that the AMU should be put “in the freezer” — signalled either hostility or apathy toward active AMU leadership and raised concerns that Libyan control would politicise or degrade AMU functioning.
- Throughout the 1990s and 2000s the Morocco–Algeria rivalry, rooted in the Western Sahara dispute, effectively froze AMU meetings and initiatives.
- 2003: UN mediation produced the Baker Plan II (James Baker), which the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR)/Polisario Front accepted but Morocco rejected. The plan’s failure left mediation without a durable political settlement.
- 2003–2005: Additional bilateral crises — notably an alleged Libyan secret-service role in a 2003 coup attempt against Mauritania’s president (which Libya denied) — further exacerbated distrust. A 2005 top-level AMU conference was derailed when Morocco refused to attend while Algeria continued to support Sahrawi independence.
- By 2023 the AMU’s single-currency project was judged technically possible but politically infeasible, a succinct statement of the gap between economic design and political will.
- April 2024: Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya began discussing a new North African entity to replace the AMU, explicitly regarding the AMU as “inoperative” without Morocco (and effectively without Mauritania).
- November 2024: Algerian President Tebboune invited leaders from Tunisia, Mauritania, Libya, and the Sahrawi Republic to commemorate the 70th anniversary of 1 November 1954 — an act interpreted as the diplomatic seed of a new union excluding Morocco (and reportedly without Mauritania’s robust participation).
- January 2025: A third tripartite summit among Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya was scheduled/held in Tripoli, confirming operational follow-through on a three-country format.

Collectively, these episodes show how a combination of territorial contestation, rivalry, and procedural gridlock can immobilise a regional organisation for decades.

### 2. The proximate cause: Western Sahara and its political fallout

- Background: Western Sahara — a former Spanish colony — was invaded by Morocco and Mauritania in the 1970s. The Polisario Front proclaimed the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR) and fought both occupiers, with Algeria as its principal external backer.
- The Western Sahara question is the single most important political blockage to Maghreb integration. Morocco’s rejection of any outcome that would permit Sahrawi independence collides directly with Algeria’s long-standing support for the Polisario/SADR and the principle of self-determination.
- Third-party mediation (notably the UN/James Baker process in 2003) produced viable frameworks on paper that failed in practice because Morocco would not accept the plan’s implications. This stalemate hardened interstate positions and made multilateral Maghreb forums unworkable.

### 3. Bilateral rivalries that spill into multilateral space

- Algeria–Morocco: This rivalry is structural and territorial. It undermines AMU meetings, joint policies, and any credible rotation of leadership when one or other party refuses participation.
- Libya–Mauritania: Accusations of Libyan interference in a 2003 coup attempt against Mauritania’s president (Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya) created a separate axis of mistrust, illustrating that intra-regional disputes are not monolithic but multiple.
- Libya under Gaddafi: Tripurposed rhetoric and unpredictable diplomacy (e.g., “in the freezer”) could delegitimise AMU processes and raised concerns about negative influence if Libya assumed presidencies or leadership roles.

These bilateral grievances are not merely irritants; they are structural obstacles that convert a regional organisation into a hostage of inter-state politics.

### 4. Institutional and procedural weaknesses of the AMU

- The Constitutive Act: The AMU’s rule of annual rotation of the presidency presumes quorum and participation. When members boycott, the rotation mechanism becomes unworkable. The 1994 transfer attempt exposed this vulnerability vividly.
- Absence of enforcement and dispute-resolution mechanisms: The AMU lacked robust, neutral procedures to manage boycotts, enforce decisions, or adjudicate inter-state disputes that directly affect the Union’s functioning.
- The result was a legal-procedural paradox: rules designed to ensure inclusive leadership became the very avenue through which a minority of recalcitrant states could paralyse the organisation.

### 5. Operational consequences: stalled integration and security gaps

- Institutional paralysis: AMU meetings became irregular or suspended for decades, preventing sustained policy coordination across the Maghreb.
- Abandoned projects: Major integration initiatives — a single currency, customs union, freedom of movement, large-scale joint investments in food production and desalination — were stalled or abandoned, not for technical but for political reasons.
- Security deficits: Lack of regional cooperation undermined coordinated responses to irregular migration, transnational organised crime, and cross-border terrorism — issues that require inter-state trust and information-sharing.
- Economic opportunity costs: The absence of a functioning Maghreb common market limited scale economies in agriculture, water, trade, and infrastructure.

### 6. Recent reconfiguration: minilateralism and the tripartite track (2023–2025)

- From pan-Maghreb to minilateralism: Practical politics has pushed some states (Algeria, Tunisia, Libya) toward a smaller, politically more homogeneous cooperation framework. April 2024 talks envisaged joint working groups on common border security, irregular migration, large joint investments (cereal production, seawater desalination), and free movement of goods and people among the three countries.
- Diplomatic signalling: November 2024’s invitation to the Sahrawi leader and the January 2025 Tripoli summit indicate the tripartite track is operational and potentially institutionalising an alternative to the AMU.
- Effectively, the Maghreb is fragmenting into competing or non-overlapping cooperation clusters — a de facto split that runs the risk of permanent institutional disaggregation.

### 7. External mediation: limits and lost opportunities

- UN mediation (Baker Plan II) demonstrated that third-party proposals may be technically sound but fail without political buy-in from key parties.
- The AMU’s weakness left little scope for external actors (African Union, European Union, UN) to enforce outcomes; external mediation repeatedly produced plans that could not bridge the core political gap over Western Sahara.
- The regional reconfiguration may change how external partners engage: an exclusive tripartite bloc could attract different partnerships than an inclusive AMU.

### 8. Geopolitical risks and implications

- Permanent fragmentation of North African cooperation reduces the region’s ability to coordinate on Sahel security, Mediterranean migration, and counter-terrorism.
- New blocs can provoke compensatory alignments, bilateral military or economic deals, and outside powers’ influence — all of which can deepen polarisation.
- Exclusion of Morocco from joint projects decreases the economic and strategic value of any regional initiative and complicates EU–Maghreb relations given Morocco’s comparative advantages and external linkages.

### 9. Recommendations and prescriptive lessons (with specific relevance to India)

The AMU’s trajectory offers several actionable lessons for states crafting regional strategies or participating in institutional architectures:

- Prioritise technical, non-political cooperation as confidence-building measures. Issue-specific projects — water management, food security, border security, migration management — can create functional interaction channels that survive political disputes and build practical interdependence.
- Strengthen institutional rules to anticipate non-cooperation. Constitutive texts should include contingency mechanisms: clear quorum rules, procedures for handling boycotts, impartial arbitration, and temporary delegations of duties to prevent deadlock when members withdraw from meetings.
- Use neutral third-party mediation judiciously. The AU, UN, or a mutually trusted third party can reopen dialogue on intractable disputes, but mediation must be backed by incentives and realistic sequencing to secure buy-in.
- Employ phased reintegration. Begin with joint working groups on technical areas that include all parties (even reluctant ones) to rebuild habituation to cooperation before tackling politically sensitive umbrellas (currency union, full customs integration).
- Leverage track-two diplomacy. Academic, business, and civil-society exchanges preserve cross-border networks of trust when official channels are frozen; such networks often seed later official rapprochements.
- Prepare for minilateralism without abandoning multilateral aims. If practical politics favours smaller coalitions, ensure that such initiatives remain complementary to broader regional architectures rather than exclusive alternatives.

For India, which engages across diverse regional settings (South Asia, Indian Ocean, Indo-Pacific), the AMU case underscores the strategic importance of institutional design that foresees political divergence. India’s national security policy should thus:

- Promote pragmatic, technical cooperation with neighbours (connectivity, disaster relief, counter-terrorism) so that operational ties are resilient to political disputes.
- Support multilateral rules that contain clear conflict-management procedures to prevent single disputes from cascading into organisational paralysis.
- Be cautious in endorsing or forming exclusive minilateral blocs that might institutionalise fragmentation and foreclose later comprehensive engagement.

### 10. Conclusion — a cautionary parable for regionalists

The AMU’s paralysis is not merely an African anecdote; it is a cautionary parable about the fragility of regional institutions in the absence of political reciprocity and robust procedural safeguards. Territorial disputes, bilateral rivalries, and weak enforcement mechanisms can convert integrative frameworks into battlegrounds of rivalry. For strategists and policymakers — including those shaping India’s regional engagement — the lesson is clear: design institutions that can withstand political shocks, prioritise technical cooperation to build reciprocity, and maintain flexible channels (official and non-official) to prevent permanent institutional fragmentation.

Key actors: Algeria (central to leadership dynamics and Polisario support), Morocco (principal adversary on Western Sahara), Libya (disruptive under Gaddafi and source of bilateral quarrels), Tunisia (participant in the tripartite track), Mauritania (its position vacillating amid accusations and selective inclusion), SADR/Polisario (the claimant), and the UN (Baker mediation). The AMU story therefore blends territorial politics, institutional design failures, and the strategic logic of minilateralism — all elements with direct salience for India’s strategic culture and national-security policymaking.
