# Introduction — Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑being (NDPHS)

Concise summary  
The Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑being (NDPHS) is an international networking platform that fosters collaboration on public health and social well‑being across the Northern Dimension region. Instituted as a formally constituted Secretariat in 2012 and hosted by the Swedish Government in Stockholm, the Partnership is financed jointly by its Partner Countries and organized as an international legal entity to enable cross‑border coordination, project management and multilateral governance.

Definition and primary purpose
- NDPHS stands for the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑being.  
- It operates primarily as a networking and coordination platform rather than as a direct service provider. Its principal aims are to:
  - strengthen professional connections among health and social‑care actors across the Northern Dimension;
  - share, co‑create and disseminate knowledge and good practice; and
  - develop and implement joint activities and projects that address transnational health and social challenges.
- Thematic focus: public health and social well‑being, including communicable and non‑communicable disease control, health systems resilience, vulnerable populations and social determinants of health.

Organizational form, Secretariat and hosting
- The Partnership is supported by a Secretariat based in Stockholm.  
- The NDPHS Secretariat was formalized in 2012; this institutionalization marks a shift from informal cooperation toward a stable multilateral instrument. Predecessor activity and collaboration likely existed prior to 2012, but the Secretariat’s establishment created durable administrative capacity.  
- The Secretariat is constituted as an international legal entity, granting it capacity to enter contracts, handle budgets, employ staff under international rules, and administer cross‑border projects.  
- Hosting: the Secretariat is hosted by the Swedish Government, which provides the national legal and administrative base, enabling predictable operational support and a local regulatory environment for the Partnership’s activities.

Funding and governance implications
- Secretariat funding is provided jointly by the Partner Countries. Joint funding signals shared ownership, multilateral governance and mutual accountability among participating states.  
- The mix of being an international legal entity hosted domestically and funded multilaterally creates a hybrid institutional design that balances sovereignty concerns with the need for independent administrative capacity.

Geographic and membership context
- The Northern Dimension context typically covers Northern Europe and adjacent areas—the Baltic Sea region, the Arctic and neighbouring territories. This geographic frame shapes the Partnership’s priorities, which reflect shared regional vulnerabilities (seasonal and environmental health risks, ageing populations, cross‑border mobility).  
- Partner Countries generally include European Union member states in the region, neighbouring states and regional partners engaged in the Northern Dimension policy framework; membership composition conditions both agenda‑setting and resource commitments.

Core functions and operational modalities
- As a networking platform, the NDPHS emphasizes coordination, information exchange, capacity building and partnership building rather than direct service delivery.  
- Key Secretariat functions likely include:
  - coordination of Partnership activities and strategic planning;
  - secretariat support to thematic working groups and expert networks;
  - project administration and financial management for joint initiatives; and
  - stakeholder liaison with governments, international organisations, NGOs and research institutions.
- The Secretariat’s legal status enables contracting, grant‑making, and administrative continuity across jurisdictions.

Institutional history and evolution
- The formal establishment of the Secretariat in 2012 signifies institutionalization of cooperation that may have begun in more informal forms earlier. This evolution illustrates a common trajectory in regional governance: from episodic collaboration to standing multilateral instruments to better manage persistent cross‑border issues.

Relevance for a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- While the NDPHS is regionally focused, its institutional features offer comparative lessons for India’s engagement with health security as a component of national security:
  - Hybrid institutional designs (international legal entity + host state) can reconcile national sovereignty with the need for independent, transnational operational capacity.  
  - Joint funding and multilateral governance build shared ownership—relevant for India when designing or participating in cooperative health security mechanisms in South Asia or Indo‑Pacific forums.  
  - Networking platform models are effective where coordination, information sharing and capacity building are primary objectives (for example, in pandemic preparedness, cross‑border disease surveillance and migrant health).  
  - The geographic specificity of NDPHS (Baltic/Arctic) underscores that regional identity and shared risk perceptions drive agenda formation—a reminder that India’s regional initiatives must align institutional design to the contours of regional threats and partner perceptions.

Key takeaways
- NDPHS is an international networking platform dedicated to public health and social well‑being, supported by a Stockholm‑based Secretariat established as an international legal entity in 2012 and hosted by Sweden.  
- Its institutional design—international legal personality, domestic hosting and joint partner funding—enables cross‑border project management, multilateral governance and shared ownership.  
- Emphasis on coordination, knowledge exchange and partnerships (rather than direct service delivery) makes the NDPHS a useful comparative model for states seeking cooperative health security arrangements; for India, elements of its design and functioning offer practical and normative lessons for regional health diplomacy and security cooperation.

## Case study: The Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑being (NDPHS) — origins, role and implications

### Origins and formal establishment
The NDPHS traces its genesis to a targeted policy forum and a rapid process of institutionalisation. The Northern Dimension Forum on Social Protection and Health convened in Joensuu, Finland, in 2002 and served as the catalytic event that brought together national authorities, regional actors and non‑state stakeholders around shared public‑health and social‑welfare concerns in northern Europe. Within a year this momentum was converted into formal intergovernmental commitment: a ministerial founding meeting held in Oslo, Norway, on 27 October 2003 established the NDPHS as an official partnership.

Key factual points
- The cooperation network grew out of a single, focused forum on social protection and health (Joensuu, 2002).  
- Formal ministerial endorsement followed quickly (Oslo, 27 October 2003), signalling institutionalisation and political buy‑in.

### Institutional character and functions
The Partnership was designed and described from the outset as an “umbrella” coordination forum. This framing is instructive: NDPHS does not principally deliver frontline services itself; rather, it creates space and mechanisms for coordination, information exchange, standard setting and the creation of synergies among actors operating at different geographic and administrative levels.

Primary functional emphases
- Coordination of activities and funding streams to avoid duplication.  
- Creation of synergies between regional, subregional and local initiatives.  
- Convening role: ministers, national agencies, international organisations, NGOs and local authorities meet within a shared framework.  
- Facilitation of best‑practice exchange and joint project development rather than direct service provision.

### Political and governance implications
The timeline and manner of the Partnership’s birth—forum to ministerial founding in roughly one year—carries several implications about the political dynamics that underpin successful regional organisations.

Analytical observations
- Rapid institutionalisation indicates strong political momentum and a clear, shared problem definition among participating states.  
- A ministerial‑level founding confers legitimacy, signalling high‑level commitment and increasing the Partnership’s capacity to mobilise resources and influence national policy actors.  
- The umbrella model emphasises facilitation and networking over hierarchical control; authority is exercised through convening power and consensus, not direct administrative command.

### Multi‑level engagement and stakeholder composition
NDPHS was explicitly conceived to work across governance layers and sectors. Its success depends on the active participation of a plurality of actors.

Typical participants and channels of engagement
- National governments and line ministries (health, social affairs, foreign affairs).  
- International organisations and donor agencies.  
- Non‑governmental organisations and civil‑society actors.  
- Regional and local authorities implementing programmes on the ground.  

The multi‑level scope enables alignment between international priorities and local implementation, but also requires mechanisms to reconcile differing capacities, mandates and time horizons.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although NDPHS is a northern‑European construct focused on public health and social well‑being, its formation and design offer several transferable lessons for Indian policymakers concerned with regional cooperation, strategic culture and security policy:

Lessons and implications
- Problem‑driven forums can catalyse rapid institutionalisation. Creating targeted, issue‑specific fora (e.g., on health security, disaster response or maritime environmental protection) can help build momentum toward more formal cooperation.  
- Ministerial endorsement confers legitimacy. For India, securing high‑level political backing for regional initiatives (SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA or new thematic arrangements) strengthens prospects for sustained action.  
- Umbrella coordination works where multiplicity of actors and mandates exist. India’s security and strategic concerns often cut across ministries and levels of government; an umbrella coordination body can reduce duplication and foster whole‑of‑government responses.  
- Multi‑level engagement is essential but challenging. Aligning central policy aims with state, local and non‑state capacities requires institutional mechanisms for consultation, funding coherence and accountability—issues familiar from Indian federal governance.  
- Nordic leadership and proximity matter. The Joensuu→Oslo sequence illustrates how regional political leadership and favourable geography can accelerate cooperation. India’s regional initiatives must similarly reckon with leadership dynamics among neighbours and with the influence of external partners.

### Conclusion
The NDPHS exemplifies a pragmatic model of regional cooperation born from a focused problem forum and fast‑tracked to ministerial backing. Its umbrella, coordination‑first approach—and its reliance on multi‑level participation—offers a concise template for states seeking to convert shared transnational problems into sustained cooperative frameworks. For India, the case reinforces the strategic value of targeted forums, high‑level legitimacy and institutional arrangements that prioritise coordination and synergy across diverse actors.

## 5.x Case study: The NDPHS mandate — content, implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture

This section analyses a concise, authoritative statement drawn from the founding document of the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑being (NDPHS). Although the NDPHS is a regional European initiative, its structure and stated aims illustrate how health and social policy can be integrated into a broader security strategy. For students of India’s strategic culture and national security policy the statement offers a useful template for thinking about non‑traditional security, cross‑border governance, equity and demographic resilience.

1. Source and formal mandate
- The passage under consideration is not rhetorical: it is embedded in the NDPHS founding document and therefore carries formal authority. As with any intergovernmental instrument, the wording reflects negotiated priorities and creates a platform for collective action, resource allocation and monitoring. For strategists, the legal/charter origin of a policy statement matters because it shapes accountability, institutional design and the capacity to coordinate across jurisdictions.

2. Primary goal: sustainable development through health and wellbeing
- The core formulation—“to promote sustainable development in the Northern Dimension area through improving human health and social wellbeing”—places health and social wellbeing squarely within the development sphere. Rather than treating health as a subordinate technical sector, the statement frames it as both an instrument and an objective of sustainable development. In strategic terms this signals a recognition that population health underpins economic resilience, social cohesion and therefore national and regional security.

3. Geographic focus: the Northern Dimension area
- The mandate is geographically targeted. Defining a “Northern Dimension area” aligns resources and political attention to a bounded region with shared risks and interdependencies. For India, which faces regionally differentiated health and security challenges (e.g., the northeast, border areas, island territories), the lesson is the value of spatially tailored strategies that combine national policy with subregional partnerships.

4. Health focus — communicable diseases
- A central operational task is reducing the spread of major communicable diseases. This classic public‑health priority has obvious security implications: cross‑border transmission can destabilize communities, overwhelm health systems and impair military and civil readiness. Programmatic emphasis on surveillance, early warning and joint outbreak response is implicit in this formulation.

5. Health focus — non‑communicable diseases (NCDs)
- The statement explicitly elevates prevention of lifestyle‑related NCDs (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, addictions). By naming NCDs, the partnership acknowledges long‑term demographic and fiscal threats: rising NCD prevalence erodes labour productivity, increases health expenditure and can strain social safety nets—issues of strategic concern for any national planner.

6. Social wellbeing as a co‑equal objective
- Social wellbeing is not an afterthought but a central aim alongside direct health measures. This expands the policy toolkit beyond clinical interventions to include income security, housing, education, and mental health — factors that influence both susceptibility to disease and the resilience of populations to shocks.

7. Behavioural and cultural aims: promoting socially rewarding lifestyles
- The phrase “promoting socially rewarding lifestyles” points to preventive, behavioural change policies and cultural engagement. These are inherently long‑term and politically sensitive interventions, requiring local legitimacy and culturally attuned messaging. Strategically, such aims underscore the soft‑power dimension of health policy: shaping norms and behaviours can be as important for stability as strengthening hospitals.

8. Reference to the Oslo Declaration: broader impacts expected
- By invoking the Oslo Declaration, the statement situates specific health actions within a broader set of expected political and social outcomes. Declarations and political frameworks help link technical programmes to higher‑order goals like cohesion and shared values, reinforcing intergovernmental commitment.

9. Policy and administrative coherence
- The mandate explicitly expects activities to “contribute to greater political and administrative coherence” across the area. Coherence here means harmonised policies, interoperable systems and aligned incentives—necessary conditions for joint responses to transboundary risks. For India, achieving such coherence across federal, state and local levels remains a perennial strategic challenge.

10. Equity objective: narrowing social and economic differences
- The partnership commits to narrowing social and economic disparities within the region. Equity is not just a moral claim; it is strategic. Large inequalities fuel grievances, migration pressures and weak social trust—factors that complicate governance and security. Equity‑focused interventions are therefore preventive investments in stability.

11. Quality of life and demographic objectives
- The document makes explicit connections to quality of life and the “demographic situation” (population health, fertility, ageing). These demographic dimensions have direct bearings on national power, economic vitality and defence planning. Policy that stabilises or improves demographic trends is integral to long‑term national security calculations.

12. Implication — the necessity of a multisectoral approach
- Taken together, the statement implies that these goals cannot be achieved by the health sector alone. Coordination across health, social protection, education, labour, environment and governance sectors is essential. The multisectoral approach is a central tenet of modern strategic thinking about non‑traditional threats.

13. Likely stakeholders and modes of cooperation
- Achieving the mandate presumes an inclusive stakeholder architecture: national and regional governments, municipalities, public health agencies, NGOs, international organisations (for example, the EU and WHO in the NDPHS case) and civil society. Effective partnerships require clearly defined roles, funding mechanisms and channels for civil‑society participation to maintain local legitimacy.

14. Monitoring and indicators
- Operationalising the mandate demands measurable indicators: incidence and prevalence of communicable diseases, rates of key NCDs, life expectancy, wellbeing indices, and demographic indicators (fertility, migration, age structure). These metrics enable accountability and allow strategic planners to prioritise scarce resources.

15. Alignment with global agendas
- The NDPHS aims align naturally with global frameworks such as the Sustainable Development Goals (in particular SDG 3 on health and wellbeing and SDG 10 on reduced inequalities). Such alignment enhances legitimacy, facilitates access to international funding and allows benchmarking against global standards—practical advantages for national security planning that seeks external cooperation without ceding sovereignty.

16. Operational challenges: the politics of behaviour change and cultural sensitivity
- Promoting “socially rewarding lifestyles” and addressing NCD risk factors requires sustained behavioural interventions, culturally sensitive messaging and trust‑building. These activities are politically delicate, often requiring incentives, regulation and long horizons before measurable effects emerge. For strategists, understanding these time‑lags and the politically contested nature of lifestyle interventions is crucial.

17. Practical programmatic focus areas
- The policy statement points to concrete operational priorities: cross‑border disease surveillance and information sharing; preventive health promotion campaigns; social‑inclusion policies for marginalised groups; and capacity‑building aimed at administrative coherence (training, interoperable data systems, joint contingency planning).

Concluding remarks: Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India, the NDPHS statement is instructive not because its geographic remit matches India’s, but because its framing integrates health, social wellbeing, equity and governance coherence into an explicitly strategic agenda. India’s strategic culture increasingly recognises non‑traditional threats—pandemics, chronic disease burdens, demographic change—as central to national resilience. Adapting the NDPHS template suggests practical steps: formalise cross‑sectoral mandates that link health to development and security objectives; institutionalise subregional cooperation where appropriate; invest in monitoring frameworks that bridge epidemiology and social indicators; and design culturally attuned, long‑term behavioural strategies. Such an approach would treat health policy not as a sectoral footnote but as a pillar of India’s national security strategy.

## Structure

The Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well-being (NDPHS) presents a clear, purpose-built institutional architecture that separates political steering from operational execution while embedding technical expertise and continuity. The structure is compact but functionally layered, designed to translate high-level policy guidance into measurable public‑health action. The following section dissects the principal components of that architecture, their relationships, and the wider governance implications—drawing out lessons relevant to states (such as India) that seek robust intergovernmental coordination in health-security and other cross‑sectoral policy domains.

### 1. Highest-level political authority: Partnership Annual Conference (PAC)
- The Partnership Annual Conference (PAC) is the NDPHS’s supreme decision-making body. It is a high-level ministerial forum whose resolutions and policy orientations carry political weight.
- As a ministerial dialogue, PAC provides legitimacy and strategic direction: decisions adopted here signal priority commitments by participating governments and facilitate resource mobilization and inter-ministerial coordination within partner states.
- Because PAC decisions require endorsement at ministerial level, they create upward accountability and reinforce the political salience of the Partnership’s public‑health agenda.

Analytical note: Ministerial-level endorsement is crucial where policies require cross-government implementation—health security, for instance, depends on collaboration between health, interior, finance and foreign ministries. For India, this underscores the value of securing high-level buy-in for cross-cutting initiatives to ensure national bureaucracies align behind international commitments.

### 2. Operational governance: Committee of Senior Representatives (CSR)
- The Committee of Senior Representatives (CSR) functions as the operational decision-making body. It is composed of senior officials appointed by each Partner and is responsible for ensuring fulfillment of PAC decisions and recommendations.
- The CSR chairs the ongoing governance of the Partnership, translating ministerial policy into operational priorities, approving plans, and overseeing Expert Groups and projects.
- Chairmanship of the CSR rotates among Partners every two years; for 2024–2025 the Partnership is chaired by Lithuania with Norway serving as co‑chair. This rotation fosters shared ownership, emerging leadership opportunities, and diversity in priorities and management styles.
- CSR → PAC reporting lines create vertical accountability while allowing the CSR discretion to manage the day‑to‑day portfolio.

Analytical note: Rotating leadership is a common device in multilateral bodies to prevent dominance by any single partner and to promote buy‑in. For national policy communities, rotation can be accompanied by robust Secretariat support to preserve continuity across cycles.

### 3. Technical and delivery arms: Expert Groups (EGs) and project partners
- The major practical work of the Partnership—designing and implementing the NDPHS Strategy, the Action Plan, and specific projects—is carried out by Expert Groups and by project partner organizations (national agencies, international organizations, NGOs, academic institutions and other stakeholders).
- Expert Groups are specialized by public‑health topic and are the primary vehicles for project elaboration, technical consensus-building, and operational delivery. They convert political directives into workplans, pilot projects, policy tools, capacity-building activities and knowledge products.
- The NDPHS organizes its substantive work around ten thematic areas: seven are led by Expert Groups and three are cross‑cutting themes that impinge on all Partnership structures.

Expert-group-led thematic areas:
- Antimicrobial Resistance (EG AMR)
- Alcohol and Substance Use (EG ASA)
- HIV, Tuberculosis and Associated Infections (EG HIV, TB & AI)
- Non-communicable Diseases (EG NCD)
- Occupational Safety and Health (EG OSH)
- Primary Healthcare (EG PHC)
- Prison Health (EG PH)

Cross-cutting thematic areas:
- Active and Healthy Ageing
- Economy of Well‑being
- Health in All Policies

Analytical note: Expert Groups are the “policy-to-practice” converters—without them, ministerial decisions remain declaratory. Their specialized focus allows for measurable outputs and peer learning. The cross‑cutting themes institutionalize multisectoral thinking (e.g., Health in All Policies), essential for addressing systemic drivers of health and security.

### 4. Secretariat: continuity, implementation support, and institutional memory
- The NDPHS Secretariat provides comprehensive support to the Partnership: logistical, analytical, administrative and programmatic. It also implements its own activities and projects aligned with the Partnership mission.
- The Secretariat serves as the main contact point for Partners and stakeholders and, crucially, as the institutional memory—preserving continuity across rotating chairs and personnel changes in Partner delegations.
- Its functions include preparing CSR and PAC documentation, coordinating EG work, overseeing monitoring and reporting mechanisms, and maintaining relations with external partners and funders.

Analytical note: Secretariat continuity is indispensable for organizations relying on rotating political leadership. Institutional memory mitigates loss of momentum and ensures long‑term projects survive leadership cycles. For national strategy-making, a permanent coordinating secretariat or equivalent body improves policy coherence across ministries and over time.

### 5. Accountability, reporting lines and coordination mechanisms
- The governance architecture institutes clear reporting lines: Expert Groups report to the CSR, which in turn reports to the PAC. These vertical flows support strategic alignment and accountability.
- Effective coordination mechanisms—regular CSR and EG meetings, standardized reporting templates, and inter-group peer review—are necessary to translate strategy into implementation and to enable adaptive management.
- Monitoring frameworks, with indicators tied to the Action Plan and periodic evaluations of EG performance and thematic relevance, are essential to adapt priorities to emerging public‑health threats and to demonstrate impact.

Analytical note: Clarity in reporting relationships and periodic evaluation are governance best practices. They allow the Partnership to reallocate resources responsively and maintain legitimacy through demonstrable outcomes.

### 6. Partners, resources and enablers
- Partner organizations that carry out practical work typically include national authorities, international agencies, NGOs, and academic institutions. Their involvement brings technical capacity, local legitimacy and access to implementation channels.
- The outline does not detail funding and resource-allocation mechanisms, but financing arrangements are a critical enabler: predictable funding streams, co‑financing modalities, and donor engagement determine the feasibility of projects and the sustainability of activities.
- Regular external and internal evaluation of EG effectiveness, thematic relevance and resource use can inform re-prioritization and ensure the Partnership remains responsive to changing epidemiological and social landscapes.

Analytical note: Funding uncertainty is a common constraint in multilateral partnerships. For states seeking to leverage such partnerships for national benefit, aligning domestic budgetary allocations or leveraging co-financing can amplify impact and provide stability.

### 7. Cross-cutting themes and integrated approaches
- The three cross‑cutting areas—Active and Healthy Ageing, Economy of Well‑being, and Health in All Policies—are designed to permeate all EGs and Partnership activities. They encourage integrated, multisectoral approaches that cut across disease‑specific silos.
- Embedding cross‑cutting priorities across EGs encourages synergy (e.g., addressing antimicrobial resistance alongside primary healthcare strengthening) and helps mainstream themes that otherwise risk marginalization.

Analytical note: Cross‑cutting mechanisms are particularly important for national security considerations where health, economy and social policy intersect. Institutionalizing cross‑cutting lenses reduces fragmentation and fosters systemic responses to complex threats.

Conclusion — relevance to India's strategic culture and national security policy
The NDPHS’s architecture typifies a multilevel governance model balancing political legitimacy, operational capacity and technical specialization. Key design features—ministerial endorsement (PAC), a senior officials’ executive body (CSR) with rotating leadership, specialized expert groups for implementation, and a professional Secretariat for continuity—offer practical lessons for India’s international engagement and domestic coordination in health security and other cross-sectoral domains. Specifically:
- Securing high-level political endorsement institutionalizes inter-ministerial coherence.
- A senior-representatives committee can operationalize strategy while allowing technocrats to manage delivery.
- Specialist technical groups (or task forces) translate policy into concrete programs and measurable outputs.
- A stable secretariat or coordinating agency safeguards institutional memory across political cycles.
- Cross‑cutting thematic lenses and robust monitoring frameworks improve resilience and policy adaptability.

These elements, adapted to India’s federal structure and strategic culture, can strengthen the state’s capacity to coordinate inter-agency responses to health-security challenges and to engage effectively in regional and global partnerships.

### Activities

This section dissects the core activities of the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑being (NDPHS), explains how those activities function in practice, and draws out their strategic significance — including lessons applicable to states such as India where health policy is increasingly framed as a component of national security and economic resilience.

1. Core activity areas — an overview  
The Partnership operates through four mutually reinforcing strands of work:
- Policy and expertise exchange (peer learning, workshops and expert networks);
- Project development and implementation (partnership building, funding mobilisation, operational planning);
- Information production and dissemination (reports, policy briefs, databases, conferences); and
- Advocacy (targeted outreach to regional governance structures and national policymakers).

These activities are designed not as isolated outputs but as elements of a cycle: evidence generation and demonstration projects inform policy recommendations; those recommendations are disseminated and advocated for; and policy uptake then shapes new project priorities.

2. Policy and expertise exchange  
Policy exchange is conducted through structured formats — seminars, thematic workshops, expert networks and working groups — that bring together practitioners from ministries of health and social affairs, researchers, NGOs and service providers. These fora perform three functions:
- Translate technical evidence into practicable policy options;
- Identify common problems where comparative experience is instructive; and
- Create trusted networks that accelerate uptake of innovations across borders.

In strategic terms, such exchange builds epistemic communities whose consensus can reduce transaction costs of cross‑national cooperation. For countries with large, diverse bureaucracies (including India), deliberate mechanisms for cross‑sector knowledge translation are critical to convert technical recommendations into operational policy.

3. Project development and implementation  
The Partnership supports the full project life‑cycle: from concept notes and partner identification, through funding applications, to implementation and evaluation. Practical elements include:
- Mobilising multi‑country consortia and donor engagement;
- Drafting realistic workplans with measurable outputs;
- Ensuring ethical, context‑sensitive implementation across jurisdictions.

Operationalizing projects under a regional umbrella allows pilot solutions to be tested at scale, and produces transferable implementation experience. For national security planners, projects that strengthen health systems capacity (surveillance, surge response, social safety nets) are particularly salient because they enhance societal resilience to shocks that have security consequences.

4. Information production and dissemination  
NDPHS produces and disseminates evidence in formats tailored to different audiences: technical reports for practitioners, concise policy briefs for decision‑makers, searchable databases for researchers, and public events for awareness‑raising. Effective dissemination follows four principles:
- Clarity: concise policy‑oriented recommendations accompanying technical findings;
- Targeting: separate products and channels for experts and for policymakers;
- Accessibility: open access where possible to encourage cross‑sector use; and
- Timeliness: communicating results while policy windows are open.

Translating project outcomes into policy changes requires not only robust evidence but communication strategies that respect political decision cycles — a lesson relevant to strategic policy formulation where timing and framing can determine uptake.

5. Advocacy and economic framing of health  
A consistent line of advocacy within the Partnership is to present population health not merely as a welfare objective but as a determinant of economic prosperity. Emphasising the health–economy link serves two strategic functions:
- It broadens the coalition of political supporters beyond health ministries to ministries of finance, labour and economic development; and
- It creates more durable budgetary commitment by reframing health investments as productive rather than purely consumptive.

For national security doctrine, this approach reinforces the argument that health system weaknesses are potential sources of economic and social instability and therefore legitimate objects of strategic policy and resource allocation.

6. Policy Area (PA) Health coordination within the EUSBSR  
As the designated Policy Area Coordinator for “Health” in the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region (EUSBSR), the Partnership occupies a privileged position to:
- Shape regional priorities and influence the agenda of funding calls;
- Act as a convenor between regional governance and national implementers; and
- Ensure that project pipelines align with broader strategic objectives.

Coordination capacity translates into agenda‑shaping power: the Partnership can elevate cross‑border issues (e.g., communicable disease control, ageing populations, social inclusion) into regional policy instruments. For states seeking to influence regional governance, sustained coordination roles offer leverage disproportionate to organisational size.

7. Platform for cross‑border, cross‑sector cooperation  
The Partnership provides an institutional platform that enables countries and sectors to:
- Share and scale best practices (clinical, social and organisational);
- Identify shared problems and formulate common objectives; and
- Co‑develop joint solutions that combine technical, social and economic responses.

Cross‑sector engagement typically involves health, social services, education and economic policy actors. Bringing these sectors together reduces policy fragmentation and produces integrated interventions that enhance resilience — an approach directly relevant to national security frameworks that require whole‑of‑government responses to complex risks.

8. Stakeholders and their roles
Primary stakeholders engaged by the Partnership include:
- NDPHS members (state and organisational partners);
- EUSBSR authorities and regional governance bodies;
- National and local policymakers in Baltic Sea countries;
- Health and social care institutions, NGOs and academic researchers; and
- Donors and funding agencies.

Each stakeholder plays a distinct role: donors provide resources and incentive structures; implementers validate operational feasibility; policymakers translate evidence into regulation and budgets; and civil society ensures social legitimacy and community reach.

9. Policy implications — strategic takeaways
The Partnership’s activities have three salient policy implications:
- Effective communication of project results can produce tangible shifts in regional and national health policy when timed and framed to match political incentives.
- Framing health investments in economic and security terms mobilises broader political support and can stabilise funding streams.
- Coordinated action at the Policy Area level harmonises approaches across countries, raising the prospects for interoperable systems and scalable solutions.

For national security thinkers, these implications support an expanded conception of security that recognizes health infrastructure and social well‑being as foundational to national resilience.

10. Recommended next steps for stakeholders
To maximise impact, stakeholders should:
- Ensure project outputs include concise, policy‑oriented recommendations tailored to decision‑makers;
- Design dissemination strategies that address both technical audiences and governing elites, using brief, evidence‑based messaging;
- Develop indicators that demonstrate health–economic links (e.g., productivity losses averted, fiscal returns on prevention) to strengthen advocacy; and
- Establish multi‑sector working groups (health, social policy, education, economic planning) to convert best practices into scalable, policy‑ready solutions.

11. Conclusion — relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
While the NDPHS operates in the Baltic Sea region, its modes of activity illustrate universal lessons for states like India. Integrating health into strategic policy requires institutional mechanisms for evidence translation, cross‑sector coordination, and political framing that links health outcomes to economic and security objectives. For a country balancing internal development priorities and external security imperatives, adopting similar activity portfolios could strengthen resilience, align resources behind preventive investments, and institutionalise whole‑of‑society responses to transnational health threats.

## Case study: The Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑Being (NDPHS) — composition, functions and lessons for strategic culture and national security policy

Overview  
The Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Well‑Being (NDPHS) is an intergovernmental platform focused on health and social welfare challenges in the Northern Dimension region — primarily Northern Europe, the Baltic Sea and adjoining Arctic areas. It brings together national governments and a set of regional and international organisations to coordinate policy, mobilise technical expertise and implement projects in public health, communicable disease control, social welfare and related determinants of health. For analysts of strategic culture and national security, the NDPHS is a compact example of how multilevel cooperation over ostensibly “soft” policy areas (health, migration, labour welfare) intersects with geopolitical alignment, operational resilience and regional security dynamics.

Member (partner) countries  
The Partnership’s membership is dominated by Baltic and Northern European states, with a couple of larger continental actors:

- Estonia  
- Finland  
- Germany  
- Iceland  
- Latvia  
- Lithuania  
- Norway  
- Poland  
- Sweden  
- Russia (historically a partner; suspended in 2022)

Russia’s suspension in 2022 followed Moscow’s large‑scale military actions in Ukraine and the consequent political decisions by many regional and international bodies to isolate or suspend cooperative arrangements with Russian institutions. That suspension illustrates how political crises and military aggression can rapidly reconfigure cooperative architectures even when the cooperation concerns public health and social welfare.

Partner organisations (cooperating organisations)  
The NDPHS explicitly integrates regional, European and global organisations as partners; these act as policy interlocutors, technical providers and gateways to funding and programmes:

- European Commission (EC)  
- Baltic Sea States Subregional Co‑operation (BSSSC)  
- Barents Euro‑Arctic Council (BEAC)  
- Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS)  
- International Labour Organization (ILO)  
- International Organisation for Migration (IOM)  
- Nordic Council of Ministers (NCM)  
- Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)  
- World Health Organization (WHO)

Functional significance of membership and partner mix  
The composition of countries and organisations clarifies the Partnership’s remit and operating logic:

- Geographical and political footprint: The country list — Northern, Baltic Sea and selected continental EU states — aligns the Partnership’s focus on transboundary health risks and social challenges in a specific subregion. Inclusion of Germany and Poland links the partnership to larger EU policy frameworks.  
- Multi‑level cooperation: Partner organisations span EU institutions, subregional cooperation bodies, Nordic structures and UN specialised agencies. This enables cross‑scale policy coordination (local–subregional–European–global) and brings technical specialisation (WHO, UNAIDS) into regional programming.  
- Functional roles: Partners supply policy coordination, normative guidance, technical expertise, implementation capacity and financial channels. Regional bodies (BSSSC, BEAC, CBSS, NCM) foster municipal and subnational engagement; UN agencies bring disease‑control and social protection tools; the European Commission connects programmes to EU funding mechanisms and regulatory standards.

Operational and strategic implications of Russia’s suspension  
The 2022 suspension demonstrates the vulnerability of health and social cooperation to geopolitical rupture:

- Project disruption: Joint projects that previously involved Russian institutions require reconfiguration or cessation, particularly where cross‑border data sharing, training or service delivery included Russian partners.  
- Reorientation of programming: Funding and project pipelines may be redirected to non‑Russian partners or to activities that maintain regional resilience without relying on suspended actors.  
- Strategic signalling: Suspension reinforces the linkage between political alignment and “technical” cooperation — states may use participation or exclusion from health partnerships as instruments of broader geopolitical policy.

What the partner mix signals about priority areas  
The presence of WHO, UNAIDS, ILO and IOM as partners highlights the Partnership’s substantive emphases:

- Health systems strengthening and communicable disease control (WHO).  
- HIV prevention and care (UNAIDS).  
- Labour, occupational health and social determinants of health (ILO).  
- Migration‑related health and population mobility issues (IOM).

These priorities indicate that health security in the region is conceived broadly — not only as epidemic preparedness but as social welfare, labour and migration management, all of which have security implications.

Practical implications for agenda‑setting, funding and operations  
Membership composition and partner linkages shape what is possible politically and operationally:

- Agenda‑setting: Partners with strong normative reach (WHO, EC) can steer priorities and standards; regional bodies help localise those priorities.  
- Funding pathways: European Commission partnership creates potential access to EU instruments; UN agencies can mobilise global funds and technical assistance.  
- Operational partnerships: Multi‑actor projects gain technical depth and broader legitimacy but become exposed to political ruptures (as evidenced by Russia’s suspension).

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy — concise lessons  
Although the NDPHS is regionally specific, it offers instructive lessons for India’s approach to health security and multilateral engagement:

- Multilevel architectures matter: Effective health security requires integrating municipal, subregional, national and international actors. India should deepen linkages between central ministries and subnational governments when engaging in cross‑border health cooperation.  
- Diversify partnerships to manage geopolitical risk: NDPHS experience shows that political rupture can disrupt programmes. India’s strategic posture should cultivate a broad partner base (regional, multilateral, bilateral, private) to preserve continuity in critical areas like pandemic preparedness and migrant health.  
- Embed “soft” security in strategic thinking: Health, labour and migration are core components of national resilience — they merit explicit inclusion in national security documents and doctrine.  
- Use multilateral fora to amplify norms and access resources: Engagement with organisations such as WHO, IOM and regional commissions can provide technical capacity, normative frameworks and financing instruments that complement national capabilities.  
- Anticipate operational contingencies: Mapping active projects, funding streams and partner dependencies is essential to reconfigure programmes rapidly when political alignments change.

Suggested analytical next steps for policymakers and scholars  
- Map active NDPHS projects, funding sources and actor dependencies to understand which activities are most exposed to geopolitical shocks.  
- Examine subnational engagement mechanisms (how local municipalities participate) as models for India’s intergovernmental coordination.  
- Compare NDPHS reorientation post‑2022 with other regional bodies’ adaptations to suspension/expulsion of members to draw best practices in resilience planning.

Concluding note  
The NDPHS illustrates how ostensibly technical cooperation in health and social welfare is embedded in political geography and strategic calculation. For students of strategic culture and national security policy, it reinforces two propositions: first, that non‑military domains (health, labour, migration) are vital components of contemporary security; and second, that institutional design — partner mix, multilayered linkages and funding arrangements — conditions both the effectiveness and the resilience of regional cooperation. India’s strategic planners can draw from this compact case when designing multilateral engagements that seek to advance health security without becoming unduly vulnerable to geopolitical shocks.
