# International body regulating whaling

This section examines the International Whaling Commission (IWC) — the principal multilateral institution governing whaling — and situates its history, rules and politics in a way that illuminates broader lessons for states engaged in maritime governance and security, including India.

## Origins and stated purpose
The IWC was created by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), concluded in 1946. The Convention established the Commission as the treaty’s decision‑making organ and tasked it with administering the Schedule to the Convention. The ICRW’s stated objective is succinctly expressed in the Convention’s language: to “provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry.” The Commission therefore embodies a dual mandate — conservation and the managed, sustainable use of whale resources — a tension that has structured its politics since inception.

(Note: editorial metadata appearing in some sources indicates proposals to merge separate meeting pages for IWC sessions — for example, notices proposing to merge 2005 and 2006 meeting pages into a single article have been recorded as “proposed since June 2025.” These are editorial/archival notes and do not alter the IWC’s institutional substance.)

## Institutional form and principal instruments
- The IWC functions as the governing body established by the ICRW and manages the Schedule to the Convention, which contains the concrete regulatory measures that govern whaling practice internationally.
- Although often characterized alongside other fisheries instruments, the IWC is distinct in being both a conservation and industry‑regulation body with global membership; it is commonly treated within the family of specialized fishery bodies because its remit is the management of a specific marine resource.
- The Commission is supported by a Scientific Committee that provides stock assessments, scientific advice on population status, and technical input that informs regulatory choices.
- The IWC also funds, promotes and publishes scientific research on whales and related issues, including studies on population dynamics and the humaneness of killing methods.

## The Schedule: measures and substance
The Schedule to the ICRW is the operational rulebook. Measures included in the Schedule have ranged across:
- Full protection for certain species (listing species to receive complete protection).
- Designation of whale sanctuaries (for example, the Southern Ocean Sanctuary adopted in 1994).
- Limits on numbers and sizes of whales that may be taken by member states.
- Prescription of open and closed seasons and geographic areas for whaling activity.
- Prohibitions on capture of suckling calves and of female whales accompanied by calves.
- Requirements for compilation and submission of catch reports and other statistical and biological records necessary for stock assessment and management.

The integrity of the Schedule depends heavily on the quality and completeness of member submissions (catch reporting, biological data), and on the Scientific Committee’s assessments.

## Key historical decisions and turning points
- 1986 commercial whaling moratorium: The Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial whaling that remains the defining single policy act of the IWC. The moratorium effectively prioritized conservation and recovery over commercial exploitation and is the focal point around which subsequent institutional conflict has revolved.
- Southern Ocean Sanctuary (1994): The designation of broad sanctuaries exemplifies the IWC’s conservation tools; sanctuaries were intended to protect critical habitats and aid population recovery.
- Florianópolis Declaration (2018): At the 2018 IWC meeting, a group of member states issued the Florianópolis Declaration, stating that the IWC’s purpose is whale conservation and committing to safeguard marine mammals in perpetuity and to allow their recovery to pre‑industrial population levels. This declaration signalled an explicit conservation‑first posture among a substantial subset of members.

## Politics, compliance and limits of authority
- Dual mandate and membership divide: The IWC’s persistent cleft is between states that favour a conservation‑first approach and those that assert a sustainable‑use or pro‑whaling position. This divide runs along political, cultural and economic lines and often translates into contested votes and compromises.
- Enforcement limitations: The IWC lacks strong coercive enforcement mechanisms. Compliance therefore depends on states’ domestic legal implementation, bilateral pressure, reputational costs and other diplomatic levers rather than direct enforcement by the Commission.
- Data and transparency challenges: Effective stock assessment and orderly management require reliable catch reporting and biological data. In practice, data quality and completeness have varied across members and programs, undermining some scientific assessments and fueling political disputes.
- Scientific advice and contested interpretation: The Scientific Committee provides expertise, but political actors selectively mobilise or contest scientific conclusions to justify differing policy pathways.

## Institutional shock: Japan’s withdrawal (2018–2019)
A significant institutional rupture occurred in late 2018 when Japan announced it would withdraw from the IWC. Following the Florianópolis Declaration, Japan declared on 26 December 2018 that it would leave the IWC, accusing the Commission of failing to promote sustainable whaling. Japan left the IWC in mid‑2019 and resumed commercial whaling within its territorial waters and exclusive economic zone from July 2019 after ending its Antarctic (Southern Hemisphere) whaling programme earlier that year. Japan’s exit represented a major shift in the IWC’s membership balance and underscored how deeply the conservation/sustainable‑use fault line can reshape institutional membership and behaviour.

## Research, humane methods and normative evolution
Beyond quotas and sanctuaries, the IWC has been active in researching whale biology, population dynamics and the humaneness of killing methods. Over time, the Commission’s activities and the Florianópolis Declaration indicate a normative evolution toward stronger conservation commitments among many members, even as other members press for recognition of cultural and coastal commercial whaling.

## Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although the IWC’s primary remit is conservation and resource management, its institutional dynamics offer several relevant lessons for India’s maritime strategy and broader security policy:
- Normative positioning and soft power: Active engagement in multilateral environmental regimes like the IWC constitutes an element of maritime diplomacy. India’s positions in such fora can advance its environmental credentials, contribute to regional leadership on marine conservation, and form part of a broader soft‑power strategy in the Indian Ocean region.
- EEZ stewardship and fisheries governance: The governance mechanisms the IWC uses — catch reporting, scientific committees, sanctuaries — provide a useful template for improving India’s own data systems, stock assessments and sanctuary designations in its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Robust scientific monitoring strengthens both conservation outcomes and the legitimacy of resource management decisions that affect coastal communities.
- Balancing conservation and use: The IWC’s long‑running tension between conservation and sustainable use parallels recurring dilemmas in Indian policy: how to reconcile coastal livelihoods and traditional practices with conservation obligations and international expectations. India's strategic culture, which prizes autonomous decision‑making and normative flexibility, can draw on the IWC experience to craft calibrated domestic rules that reflect both conservation imperatives and socio‑economic needs.
- Institutional resilience and exit options: Japan’s withdrawal shows that when a member state’s core preferences are irreconcilable with an institution’s prevailing trajectory, exit is an available — and consequential — option. For India, this underscores the value of building coalitions within multilateral forums and of ensuring that domestic stakeholders are aligned with international commitments to reduce the likelihood of costly reversals.

## Concluding observations
The IWC illustrates how a treaty‑based body with a technical/scientific committee, a binding Schedule, and a politically heterogeneous membership negotiates trade‑offs between conservation and use. Its history — the 1986 moratorium, sanctuaries, scientific work, the Florianópolis Declaration, and the political fallout culminating in Japan’s withdrawal — highlights the interplay of science, norms and state interests in maritime governance. For policymakers concerned with India’s strategic posture, the IWC offers practical lessons about coalition‑building, the centrality of data and science to credible rule‑making, and the diplomatic value of conservation as an element of maritime statecraft.

## Chapter X — The International Whaling Commission: Structure, Membership and Relevance to Strategic Practice

This section examines the International Whaling Commission (IWC) as an example of a sectoral international organisation whose legal design, institutional practice, and political dynamics illustrate important features of multilateral governance that matter to states’ strategic cultures and national-security thinking. The IWC’s architecture—rooted in a post‑war treaty, organized around a science‑led Schedule, and marked by durable political polarization—offers a compact case of how conservation, economic usage, and diplomatic contestation intersect in maritime governance.

### Legal foundation and mandate
- The IWC was created by a voluntary inter‑state agreement: the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling. The Convention remains the legal lodestar for all IWC authority and processes.
- The Convention sets dual aims: the “proper conservation of whale stocks” and the “orderly development of the whaling industry.” This duality—conservation alongside sustainable utilization—defines the Commission’s normative tension.
- The Commission’s regulatory authority is exercised principally through the Schedule to the Convention. The Convention requires that regulatory decisions be grounded in scientific findings; in short, the IWC has an explicit science‑based mandate. This requirement both constrains and politicizes decision‑making when scientific advice runs up against powerful political preferences.

### The Schedule: operational instrument of control
- The Schedule is the IWC’s operational rulebook. It is periodically reviewed and amended by the Commission and governs the practical conduct of whaling.
- Key functions of the Schedule:
  - Species protection and the designation of whale sanctuaries.
  - Setting catch limits, minimum sizes, and specifying open/closed seasons and areas.
  - Prescribing permitted methods and the intensity of whaling, including allowed gear types and measurement methodologies.
  - Establishing reporting requirements for catches and other data relevant to stock assessment.
- Because the Schedule translates scientific advice into legally binding operational measures, it is the locus where science, management objectives, and politics meet.

### Institutional structure and core bodies
- Secretariat and headquarters:
  - The IWC Secretariat is based in Impington, near Cambridge, England. It supports the Commission’s technical, administrative and publication functions.
  - The Secretariat publishes the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management and produces the Commission’s annual reports and meeting documentation.
- Main standing bodies:
  - Scientific Committee: provides the scientific basis for management decisions; meets annually.
  - Conservation Committee: develops and negotiates measures relating to protection, sanctuaries and conservation policy.
  - Finance and Administration Committee: oversees budgeting, finance and administrative matters.
  - Technical Committee: created to handle technical issues but currently inactive, an institutional gap that bears on the Commission’s capacity for specialized technical review.
- Decision‑making in plenary occurs through the Commission, composed of one voting Commissioner appointed by each member state; Delegations typically include scientific and policy experts and advisors to support the Commissioner.

### Membership, participation and observership
- Membership is open to states regardless of whether they actively engage in whaling. This inclusivity allows non‑whaling states to participate in, and influence, regulatory outcomes.
- Membership growth: since 2001 the IWC expanded substantially (with rapid additions between 2002 and 2008); as of February 2024 the Commission counted 88 member states. This expansion has altered voting dynamics and the balance of regional and interest‑based blocs.
- Voting and representation: each member appoints one Commissioner with voting rights; states may deploy expert advisers and larger delegations to technical sessions.
- Observers: the IWC admits observers from non‑party states, intergovernmental organisations and NGOs that meet application and attendance criteria. For NGOs, qualifying requirements can include maintaining offices in more than three countries—a rule that shapes which civil society actors can directly observe and intervene in debates.
- The interplay of expanding membership and observer access affects transparency, stakeholder influence, and the potential for coalition‑building.

### Meetings, procedures and scientific rhythm
- Plenary Commission meetings are biennial (held in even‑numbered years) since 2012, typically in September or October.
- The Scientific Committee meets annually. When both bodies meet in the same year, rules ensure a minimum separation of 100 days between scientific meetings and the Commission’s plenary so that scientific reports can be digested in advance of political decision‑making.
- Procedural rules manage the sequencing of papers, observer submissions, and the composition of negotiating working groups—procedures that matter in highly contested policy areas.

### Political dynamics: the pro‑whaling/anti‑whaling cleavage
- The Commission’s politics are sharply polarized between states that favour commercial whaling (or guarded, regulated utilization) and those that prioritize strong conservation and anti‑whaling norms.
- This cleavage produces high contention in plenary sessions, complicating consensus‑building and sometimes producing deadlock between scientific recommendations and political outcomes.
- The contested nature of IWC decision‑making illustrates how scientific mandates do not automatically depoliticize management when states’ normative, economic, or identity interests are implicated.

### Secretariat outputs and technical gaps
- Beyond meeting support, the Secretariat’s publications (notably the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management) are central repositories of scientific results and management analyses that feed into policy debates.
- The inactivity of the Technical Committee highlights a potential institutional shortfall in handling specialized technical reviews, which can widen the gap between scientific complexity and negotiators’ capacity to interpret technical advice.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national‑security policy
Although the IWC’s direct domain is cetacean management, the institution embodies several dynamics of direct relevance to India’s strategic culture and its approach to maritime security and environmental diplomacy:
- Norms and maritime governance: IWC debates showcase how states negotiate environmental norms that constrain maritime resource use. For India, participation in such forums offers avenues to shape regional standards for fisheries, biodiversity protection, and sustainable maritime resource use—issues tied to maritime livelihoods and coastal security.
- Science diplomacy and credibility: The IWC’s science‑based mandate creates space for states to deploy scientific expertise as diplomatic capital. India’s marine research institutions and cetacean science can be instruments of soft power and of technical coalition‑building in multilateral settings.
- Coalition building and voting dynamics: Rapid membership expansion and the presence of regional blocs in the IWC demonstrate how newer or middle powers can exert influence through coalition strategies, an approach congruent with India’s broader multilateral practice.
- Observer engagement and multistakeholder politics: The role of NGOs and observer rules illustrates the importance of civil society in shaping international environmental policy. India’s domestic NGOs and research networks can link national policy to international advocacy, affecting reputational and normative dimensions of strategic policy.
- Security and resource governance intersection: The IWC exemplifies how natural‑resource management (even for migratory marine species) can have strategic dimensions—conflicts over access, surveillance and enforcement at sea, and the need for inter‑agency cooperation mirror broader maritime security challenges.
- Institutional design lessons: The Commission’s dual conservation‑utilization mandate and its politically polarized decision‑making emphasize the limits of purely technocratic institutions when political stakes are high—an insight relevant for India when engaging in or designing multilateral regimes that implicate core economic or identity interests.

### Concluding observations
- The IWC is a compact but instructive case of treaty‑based, sectoral governance: it combines a treaty foundation (1946 Convention), an operational Schedule, a science‑led advisory structure, and politically charged plenary politics.
- Key facts at a glance:
  - Convention year: 1946
  - Headquarters: Impington, near Cambridge, England
  - Member count (Feb 2024): 88
  - Main committees: Scientific; Conservation; Finance and Administration (Technical Committee presently inactive)
  - Meeting frequency: Commission biennial (even years since 2012); Scientific Committee annual
- For analysts of strategic culture, the IWC matters less as a vehicle of hard power than as an arena where scientific authority, normative contestation and state interest converge—producing governance outcomes that have material implications for maritime policy, environmental security, and diplomatic posture.

## 5.x The International Whaling Commission: meeting history and institutional significance

Summary. Since its founding under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (1946) the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has provided the principal intergovernmental forum for negotiating the regulation of whaling and the conservation of whale stocks. Members have met regularly—initially every year—and on occasion in intersessional “special meetings.” The chronology of those meetings, the change in meeting rhythm after 2012, and the recurrent politicisation of the Commission illuminate both the mechanics of international environmental governance and the ways states contest marine resources. For analysts of Indian strategic culture and national security policy, the IWC’s history is relevant because it shows how states use multilateral fora to pursue conservation, commercial, and diplomatic objectives in the maritime domain.

Meeting chronology and hosts (selected list, 1969–2018). Members of the IWC met annually from the Commission’s inception in 1949. Below is the sequence of host cities for the period covered in this study (notes of exact dates are provided for the 2000s onward where recorded):

Special (intersessional) meetings. In addition to the annual sessions, the IWC has convened occasional intersessional “special meetings” to address urgent or technical matters. Between 1949 and 2007 there were five such special meetings. These are distinct from the regular annual sessions and reflect the Commission’s occasional need to address matters outside the normal calendar.

Change in rhythm: from annual to biennial Commission meetings. A significant procedural shift occurred from 2012: the IWC Commission moved from annual plenary meetings to a biennial schedule, while the IWC Scientific Committee continued to meet annually. This change explains the gaps in plenary meeting years after 2012 (for example, no Commission meetings in 2013, 2015, 2017). The retention of an annual Scientific Committee meeting preserved a continuous scientific advisory stream underpinning management deliberations.

Politics, media attention and activism. Several features of the IWC explain why its meetings have at times attracted intense public and media attention:

- The 1982 adoption of a commercial whaling moratorium (entered into force in 1986) is one of the IWC’s most consequential decisions. It remains central to political disputes between states favouring strict conservation measures and those asserting sustainable-use or cultural-historical rights to whaling.  
- From the late twentieth century onwards, an organised international anti-whaling movement—working through NGOs, direct-action campaigns and media engagement—frequently converged on host cities during meetings. Such activism has amplified the public visibility of IWC sessions and raised the reputational stakes for delegations.  
- IWC debates are regularly split along pro-whaling and anti-whaling lines; voting patterns and coalition-building within the Commission are shaped by domestic economic interests, cultural practices, and diplomatic alignments. This politicisation means that meetings are arenas of negotiation where science, law and normative claims intersect.

Institutional architecture and support. The IWC’s deliberations are supported by a small institutional infrastructure:

- The IWC Scientific Committee meets annually and provides the scientific advice that underpins many management decisions—stock assessments, bycatch concerns, and scientific permit issues. Maintaining this annual scientific rhythm has been important for evidence-based policy even after the Commission’s plenary sessions became biennial.  
- The IWC Secretariat, historically based in the Cambridge area (United Kingdom), provides administrative, logistical and technical support for meetings and for the implementation of Commission decisions.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. For a study focused on India’s strategic culture and national security, the IWC’s meeting history offers several analytical touchpoints:

- Norms and maritime governance: The IWC illustrates how conservation norms governing the high seas and coastal resources are negotiated multilaterally. India, as a maritime state with significant coastal communities and fisheries interests, engages with these norms when it participates in or responds to IWC decisions.  
- Diplomatic practice and coalition-building: The IWC exemplifies how states build coalitions (often across regional lines) to protect either conservation or sustainable-use interests. Indian diplomacy must navigate such coalitions when multilateral environmental rules have bilateral or regional security effects.  
- Public diplomacy and domestic politics: High-profile IWC meetings attract NGO activism and media scrutiny; these transnational public spheres can influence domestic constituencies and thereby affect national policy choices. Indian policymakers must weigh international reputation, domestic stakeholders (for example, coastal communities and scientific institutions), and security considerations when engaging in fora like the IWC.  
- Science–policy interface: The continuing annual work of the IWC Scientific Committee highlights how scientific advice is institutionalised in marine governance. India’s scientific institutions and its approach to integrating scientific findings into policy are part of its broader strategic culture of evidence-based maritime policy-making.

Concluding note and sources. The list above extends to the 2018 Commission meeting; readers should consult the IWC Secretariat’s official records for meetings after 2018 and for full documentary detail (resolutions, voting records, and special meeting dates). The meeting history—its locations, frequency, and modes of contestation—serves as a compact case study of how international organisations mediate competing claims over natural resources and how those processes intersect with state strategies in the maritime domain.

### Case study: The IWC moratorium on commercial whaling — an institutional politics of science, sovereignty and compliance

Background and origins
- During the 1970s a transnational anti‑whaling movement coalesced around scientific evidence of precipitous declines in many whale stocks. International attention was amplified by the 1972 UN Stockholm Conference recommendation that a ten‑year moratorium on commercial whaling be considered to allow stocks to recover, and by CITES reports (1977, 1981) that identified multiple species as endangered.
- The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) and its governing body, the International Whaling Commission (IWC), became the principal institutional arena where these scientific, normative and state interests collided. The IWC’s Scientific Committee supplied technical advice; political decisions remained the remit of the Commission.

Path to the 1982 moratorium
- Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s non‑whaling and anti‑whaling states increased their presence in the IWC. Over time their numbers gave them the capacity to outvote traditional whaling powers on contentious regulatory measures.
- A shifting position by some former whaling powers — notably the United States, which began to press for a science‑based reform of IWC rules — altered internal dynamics and bolstered the anti‑whaling coalition.
- On 23 July 1982 the IWC adopted a suspension (commonly called the “moratorium”) on commercial whaling by the qualified three‑quarters majority requirement.

The 1982 decision: text, vote and immediate legal character
- Vote: 25 in favor, 7 against, 5 abstentions (23 July 1982 — three‑quarters majority achieved).
- Core text: commercial catch limits were set to zero for the 1986 coastal season and the 1985/86 pelagic seasons and thereafter. The measure provided for review based on “best scientific advice” and envisaged a comprehensive assessment by 1990.
- Legal reach: the moratorium is legally binding under the ICRW for members that did not file timely, valid objections. The Convention’s dispute‑settlement and amendment rules mean that objections and reservations can create legal exemptions; where none are filed, the measure binds.

Objections, reservations and political responses
- Several whaling states lodged formal objections at the time or later. Japan, Norway, Peru and the Soviet Union formally objected to the moratorium on the basis that the measure was not adopted on the advice of the Scientific Committee. Objections have different legal effects from reservations under the ICRW and, if timely, exempt a state from new measures.
- Political bargaining followed: Japan and Peru ultimately withdrew their objections (Japan’s withdrawal was influenced by US pressure concerning fishing quotas in US waters). By 1988 the United States had eliminated Japanese fishing quotas; Japan then pivoted to conducting whaling under scientific permits. Norway protested the zero catch limits in 1992 and maintains it is not bound by them.
- Iceland illustrates the continuing contestation over legal form and membership: Iceland withdrew from the IWC in 1992; it rejoined in 2002 with a reservation to the moratorium. Many IWC members do not recognize that reservation as a valid objection. Italy, Mexico and New Zealand have expressed the view that the ICRW is not in force between them and Iceland, though none have pursued a formal legal challenge to Iceland’s membership.

Scope and loopholes: “commercial” versus “scientific” and indigenous whaling
- The moratorium addresses commercial whaling only. The ICRW expressly permits scientific‑research whaling (Article VIII permits lethal research where authorised by the Commission) and aboriginal subsistence whaling.
- Environmental groups and many anti‑whaling states have long alleged that “scientific” whaling has been used as a cover for commercial harvesting. Proponents of scientific permits (notably Japan) defend them as necessary for understanding population structure and management needs, and point to IWC rules that direct that meat from scientific whaling not be wasted.
- Implementation of these carve‑outs has been a perennial source of accusation and counter‑accusation: anti‑whaling states view the scientific category as a loophole; some whaling states view anti‑whaling measures as infringements of national sovereignty and subsistence rights.

Post‑moratorium practice and institutional measures
- Despite the moratorium, several states continued or resumed whaling under differing justifications:
  - Norway formally resumed commercial whaling in 1994 after lodging a formal protest against zero catch limits.
  - Japan has conducted whaling under IWC scientific permits since the moratorium came into force in 1986 (Japan later withdrew from the IWC entirely in 2019 to resume commercial whaling in its territorial waters).
  - Iceland resumed commercial hunting in September 2006 after re‑entering the IWC with a reservation.
  - The United States and some other states permit aboriginal subsistence whaling.
- Institutional innovation within the IWC: in May 1994 the Commission adopted a Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary (circa 11.8 million square miles) by a vote of 23 in favor, 1 opposed (Japan), 6 abstentions. Sanctuaries are regulatory tools that rely on member compliance for effectiveness.

Enforcement, compliance and the limits of international governance
- The IWC’s regulatory measures — like many international conservation regimes — depend principally on member‑state compliance and peer pressure. There is no global enforcement apparatus that can unilaterally compel state compliance on the high seas.
- As a result, enforcement is a mixture of: legal obligations (binding rules where no objection is filed), political pressure (diplomatic negotiations, public naming and shaming), and economic leverage (other states’ use of trade and quota arrangements to influence behaviour).
- Unilateral non‑compliance or formal objections often produce political consequences (diplomatic friction, NGO campaigns) rather than immediate legal penalties. The practical effectiveness of IWC measures varies with the willingness of states to accept Commission authority and to translate votes into national law and enforcement.

Actors, positions and power politics
- Pro‑moratorium / anti‑whaling coalition: largely composed of non‑whaling states that joined the IWC in the 1970s–1980s, the United States after its policy shift, and many international environmental NGOs. Their strategy combined science, normative mobilization and institutional participation.
- Objectors / whaling states: Japan, Norway, the Soviet Union/Russia, Iceland (with reservation), Peru (initially objected but later withdrew). These actors have relied on legal instruments (objections, reservations), domestic politics and appeals to sovereign rights and subsistence needs.
- The role of science: the Scientific Committee’s advice is technically authoritative but politically contested. Scientific findings inform votes, but political coalitions ultimately determine outcomes.

Implications — biological, legal‑institutional and strategic
- Biological: the moratorium aimed to allow whale populations to recover. Results vary by species and region; recovery has occurred for some stocks but not uniformly.
- Legal/political: the moratorium reshaped norms governing marine resource exploitation and produced enduring legal and political divisions within the IWC through the use of objections, reservations and scientific permits.
- Institutional: the entry of many anti‑whaling states altered the IWC’s internal balance of power and increased the politicization of its Scientific Committee’s advice.
- Enforcement and strategy: the case reveals how states use multilateral institutions both to constrain rivals and to shield domestic practices — employing legal mechanisms (timely objections, reservations), diplomatic bargaining (linking unrelated quotas or trade), and domestic policy choices (resuming whaling outside the IWC framework).

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Lessons on institutional engagement: the IWC moratorium demonstrates how coalition building within international organisations can change regulatory outcomes. For India — an active participant in maritime governance and a state with growing strategic maritime interests — the lesson is clear: sustained membership, expert engagement in technical organs, and coalition diplomacy can be decisive in shaping international rules that affect national interests.
- Use of legal form and reservations: the differential legal effects of objections and reservations illustrate tools states can deploy to preserve policy space while remaining within regimes. India’s strategic approach to treaties and reservations should weigh short‑term policy flexibility against long‑term normative leadership and reputation costs.
- Science, norms and domestic politics: the politicization of scientific advice in the IWC shows how technical expertise can be contested. India’s investment in indigenous scientific capacity and transparent, rule‑based decisionmaking strengthens its ability to influence international technical bodies (for fisheries, marine biodiversity, climate‑related regimes).
- Enforcement limits and coercive diplomacy: the reliance on political and economic instruments (e.g., quota bargaining) rather than centralized enforcement in the IWC is a reminder that strategic influence often occurs outside formal treaty mechanisms. India’s use of diplomatic leverage, economic statecraft and normative persuasion will shape outcomes in areas without strong supranational enforcement.
- Managing heterogeneous coalitions: the IWC experience highlights the durability of fault lines when member interests are sharply divergent. For India’s national security policy, engaging multilaterally requires anticipating cleavages, building coalitions across developing and developed states, and preparing for long, negotiated compromises rather than immediate legal victories.

Conclusion
The IWC moratorium episode is a compact illustration of how international organisations mediate scientific knowledge, normative pressure and state power. It shows the double‑edged nature of multilateralism: institutions can generate restrictive norms that protect common goods, yet they also contain legal and political openings that states exploit to preserve sovereignty and domestic interests. For scholars and practitioners of India’s strategic culture, the episode underscores the importance of technical engagement, coalition diplomacy, and calibrated use of legal instruments when shaping international rules that impinge on maritime and resource‑related security concerns.

Key dates and votes (for reference)
- 1972: UN Stockholm Conference recommends ten‑year moratorium on commercial whaling.
- 1977 & 1981: CITES reports identify many whale species as endangered.
- 23 July 1982: IWC moratorium vote — 25 for, 7 against, 5 abstentions.
- 1992: Norway protests zero catch limits and declares itself not bound.
- May 1994: Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary adopted — 23 for, 1 opposed (Japan), 6 abstentions.
- 2002: Iceland rejoins IWC with reservation to moratorium (Iceland had withdrawn in 1992).
- September 2006: Iceland resumes commercial whaling.

## Case study: The 2018 Florianópolis Declaration — multilateral conservation, national choice, and implications for India’s maritime strategy

### Background and context
The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has been the principal multilateral forum regulating whaling since the mid‑20th century. Its most consequential policy action was the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling, which remains the baseline for contemporary contestation between conservationist states and those favouring sustainable use. That institutional history explains why the 2018 meeting in Florianópolis, Brazil, became a focal point for the recurring normative and political struggle over conservation, sustainable use, and national prerogatives.

### Timeline (concise)
- 13 September 2018: IWC member states convened in Florianópolis.
- September 2018: Japan submitted a proposal to renew commercial whaling; the proposal was discussed and rejected.
- 13 September 2018: The Florianópolis Declaration was adopted (non‑binding).
- 26 December 2018: Japan announced its withdrawal from the IWC and declared it would resume commercial whaling within its territorial waters and its 200‑mile EEZ from July 2019; it also stated it would cease whaling in the Antarctic, the northwest Pacific and the Australian Whale Sanctuary.

### Substance of the Florianópolis Declaration
The Declaration reaffirmed, in normative and political terms, the IWC’s primary purpose as the conservation of whales. Key commitments and positions in the text and surrounding debate included:
- A collective commitment to safeguard marine mammals in perpetuity and to aim for the recovery of whale populations to “pre‑industrial” levels (a purposely ambitious and historically framed baseline).
- An explicit stance that lethal research methods are unnecessary, reflecting confidence in non‑lethal scientific techniques (photo‑ID, biopsies, acoustic monitoring, and other methods).
- An explicit preservation of the IWC’s long‑standing treatment of indigenous or aboriginal subsistence whaling: small‑scale, culturally‑specific hunts remain permissible under existing exemptions.
- The declaration was political and normative rather than a treaty amendment: it did not change binding IWC rules or alter the 1986 moratorium.

Voting on the declaration produced a clear political signal: 40 states backed the declaration and 27 opposed it. The numerical split crystallised the durable global cleavages between conservationist and pro‑use coalitions within the IWC.

### Japan’s withdrawal: legal and operational consequences
Japan responded to the Declaration by withdrawing from the IWC on 26 December 2018, arguing that the Commission had failed to promote sustainable hunting. The practical consequences announced by Tokyo were:
- Resumption of commercial whaling within Japan’s territorial waters and its 200‑mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) from July 2019, regulated under national law and consistent with Japan’s rights under UNCLOS for EEZ jurisdiction.
- Cessation of Japanese whaling operations in the Antarctic Ocean, in parts of the northwest Pacific, and within the Australian Whale Sanctuary.

Legally, Japan’s withdrawal highlights a central limit to the IWC’s authority: when a state chooses to exit, the Commission cannot bind that state’s domestic activities in areas where the state exercises jurisdiction. Politically and operationally, the withdrawal shifted Japan’s whaling activity geographically (away from the high seas/Antarctic) and under Tokyo’s domestic regulation rather than under IWC governance.

### Scientific and conservation considerations
- The Declaration’s rejection of lethal research reflects mainstream scientific consensus that non‑lethal methodologies can yield robust population, health and stock‑structure data.
- The ambition to recover populations to “pre‑industrial levels” is ecologically bold but scientifically and historically difficult to operationalise, because the baseline is imprecise and varies by stock.
- Indigenous and aboriginal subsistence whaling remains a separate policy track in IWC practice, complicating the line between conservation and cultural rights.

### Political, legal, and operational implications (general and for India)
Political:
- The vote and Japan’s withdrawal underscore increasing polarisation within the IWC and the fragility of consensus on resource use vs protections. This is emblematic of broader multilateral tensions where normative commitments collide with national economic or cultural objectives.

Legal:
- Withdrawal demonstrates the limits of international organisations whose effective authority depends on member buy‑in. States can re‑territorialise regulation (apply national law within EEZs) under UNCLOS when multilateral fora diverge from national interests.

Operational and conservation:
- The practical effect of the Declaration is mainly normative: it strengthens global conservation messaging and scientific practice norms but does not, by itself, alter legally binding whaling rules.
- Japan’s shift to coastal/EEZ whaling has localized conservation implications: coastal stocks and nearshore populations should be monitored for impacts distinct from Antarctic stocks.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and maritime policy:
- Multilateral environmental governance, such as the IWC’s debates, intersects with India’s strategic concerns in several ways: maritime resource sovereignty, norms of maritime environmental stewardship, and regional diplomatic signalling.
- India, as a maritime state with significant coastal ecosystems and blue‑economy aspirations, has stakes in predictable, science‑based regimes for marine life protection. The Florianópolis episode highlights how normative leadership (supporting strong conservation declarations) can contribute to international reputation but may have limited teeth without domestic enforcement and regional cooperation.
- Strategically, India must balance international environmental commitments with national economic and subsistence interests (including rights of coastal and indigenous fishing communities), and be prepared to manage the diplomatic consequences when major actors exit multilateral frameworks.
- Practically, the case suggests attention to domestic legal capacity to regulate marine practices within the EEZ and to step up scientific monitoring of cetacean populations in the Indian Ocean region.

### Stakeholders
- IWC member states (conservationist bloc and pro‑whaling bloc)
- Japan (proposed commercial whaling, subsequently withdrew)
- Indigenous communities with recognized subsistence whale‑taking
- Conservation NGOs and the international scientific community advocating non‑lethal research
- Coastal states, maritime managers, fisheries regulators and regional partners (including India and other Indian Ocean littorals)

### Vote summary and legal status
- For the Florianópolis Declaration: 40
- Against: 27
- Note: The Declaration was non‑binding. The vote reflected the political balance of opinion but did not change IWC obligations or the moratorium.

### Recommended watch items and key metrics
For policy analysts and strategists—particularly in India and other coastal states—monitoring should include:
- National catch numbers, by state, species, and geographic distribution (noting Japan’s July 2019 resumption within EEZs).
- IWC membership changes, voting patterns, and any movement toward modifying binding rules.
- Scientific assessments of affected whale populations, especially nearshore/coastal stocks in the Indian Ocean and adjacent seas.
- Bilateral and regional diplomatic responses and initiatives (e.g., conservation partnerships, bilateral fisheries agreements).
- Domestic legal and regulatory changes in states that withdraw or seek alternative governance arrangements.

### Concluding observations
The Florianópolis Declaration and Japan’s withdrawal illustrate how international environmental governance can produce strong normative statements without binding operational effect. For India’s strategic culture, the episode is instructive on multiple levels: it underscores the importance of multilateral engagement to shape international norms; it highlights the institutional fragility when key states recalibrate national policies; and it reinforces the need for credible domestic scientific capacity and regulatory frameworks to govern marine resources in the face of shifting multilateral landscapes. The strategic response requires both diplomatic leadership in multilateral fora and robust national practice—scientific monitoring, legal instruments within the EEZ, and regionally coordinated conservation measures—to translate normative gains into durable outcomes for marine biodiversity and national maritime security.

### The International Whaling Commission: Treaty Basis, Voluntary Character, and Practical Limits

Claim and correction
- It is commonly asserted that the International Whaling Commission (IWC) is a “voluntary” international organization not backed by a treaty and therefore lacking authority. This statement needs qualification. The IWC was created by the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling — it is a treaty-based organization. Yet many of the practical consequences that observers describe as “voluntary” flow from the treaty’s design and from the political realities of interstate behaviour: the Convention depends on member-state consent for actions, allows formal objections and withdrawal, and contains no powerful centralized enforcement machinery. In short: treaty-based, but with important voluntary features in practice.

Why the IWC appears “voluntary”
- The Convention’s institutional design and customary multilateral practice give states several tools to avoid or limit their obligations without leaving the organization entirely:
  - Withdrawal: Any member may withdraw from the IWC and cease to be bound by the Convention’s obligations. Withdrawal is a routine legal option in multilateral treaties and directly creates a check on the organization’s capacity to impose unpopular measures.
  - Formal objections / reservations: The Convention and subsequent IWC procedures permit member states to lodge objections to particular regulations or amendments within a prescribed period (commonly phrased as a 90‑day window for objections to measures coming into force). This legal mechanism effectively allows a state to opt out of a specific rule while remaining an IWC member.
  - Absence of sanctions: The IWC lacks the capacity to impose direct, binding penalties (fines, trade sanctions, or coercive enforcement) on non‑compliant members. Compliance therefore depends principally on domestic implementation, diplomatic pressure and reputational effects.

How these limits operate in practice (examples)
- Japan: In 2019 Japan exercised the option to withdraw from the IWC and, soon after, resumed commercial whaling in its territorial waters. Japan’s withdrawal illustrates the ultimate escape valve in treaty design: if a majority decision is politically unacceptable, a state can return to national regulation.
- Norway and Iceland: Both states remained IWC members but used formal objections or reservations to continue whaling despite the IWC’s moratorium on commercial whaling. Their use of the objection mechanism demonstrates how a treaty’s opt‑out features can subvert collective measures without causing organizational collapse.
- These cases show that legal membership does not equal accepting all collective measures; the balance between consensus and sovereignty shapes outcomes.

Legal rationale for objections/reservations
- Objections and reservations are common features of multilateral instruments. They serve two functions: (1) allow broader participation in a forum by accommodating states that cannot accept specific measures, and (2) reduce incentives for outright withdrawal by providing a partial escape that preserves institutional engagement. The trade-off is clear: inclusiveness and longevity of the body against the strength and uniformity of compliance.

Enforcement reality and consequences
- The IWC’s effectiveness rests on soft levers: member-state implementation through national law, peer and public pressure, scientific monitoring and diplomatic negotiation. There is no independent enforcement arm with coercive power. Consequently:
  - Collective measures can be weakened by persistent objections or by withdrawal.
  - Consensus building and political will among key members become decisive for the IWC’s authority.
  - Compliance is uneven and contingent on domestic priorities and broader foreign-policy interests of members.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- The IWC experience provides several transferable lessons for Indian strategic practice:
  - Institutional design matters: When India participates in or advocates international regimes — whether on maritime security, fisheries, or environmental protection — it must consider not only legal texts but the mechanisms available for compliance, dispute resolution and enforcement.
  - Sovereignty and opt‑out incentives shape behaviour: States will use procedural options to protect core national interests. India should anticipate and plan for selective compliance by partners, designing negotiations and domestic law to reduce exploitable opt‑outs.
  - Coalitions and diplomacy are essential: Where enforcement is weak, enduring outcomes depend on coalition‑building, normative leadership, and domestic legal measures that translate international commitments into enforceable national policy.
  - Use of carrots and sticks: Strengthening compliance often requires incentives (trade, aid, reputational advantages) or binding dispute‑settlement mechanisms; India’s approach to multilateral regimes should weigh how such levers can be packaged to secure durable cooperation.

Possible remedies to strengthen compliance
- If the objective is to reduce the “voluntary” gap between treaty rules and behaviour, the following institutional reforms or policy instruments can be considered:
  - Treaty amendment to create clearer compliance obligations and restrict opt‑out windows.
  - Creation of dispute‑settlement or compliance review mechanisms with defined procedures and remedies.
  - Linkage of regime compliance to trade, funding or technical assistance to produce positive or negative incentives.
  - Emphasis on domestic implementation: encourage members to adopt implementing legislation and enforcement capacities that make international rules operational at the national level.
  - Use of transparency, independent monitoring and civil society engagement to increase reputational costs of non‑compliance.

Conclusion
- The IWC is a treaty‑based body whose practical authority is constrained by state sovereignty, opt‑out mechanisms and the absence of centralized enforcement. Its experience underscores a core theme in the study of international organisations and Indian strategic culture alike: institutional form does not guarantee political effect. For policymakers, the central challenge is how to convert negotiated commitments into enforceable practice—through design choices, domestic law, diplomatic strategy and the selective use of incentives.

### 6.4 Case Study: International Observer Schemes in Whaling — Transparency by Presence

In the early 1970s a modestly framed, practical innovation in compliance monitoring appeared in the international whaling regime: the International Observer Scheme (IOS). Initially bilateral and later multilateral, these arrangements—most notably the 1971 reciprocal exchange between Australia and South Africa, a North Atlantic scheme among Canada, Iceland and Norway, and a North Pacific pact between Japan and the United States—were devised to place independent, on-site observers at land-based whaling stations. Though technically pragmatic rather than doctrinally revolutionary, the IOS offers an instructive example of how states can design low‑cost, trust‑building mechanisms to strengthen reporting integrity within contested resource regimes.

What the IOS was intended to do
- Functionally, the IOS provided independent verification of catch records: observers recorded species, number and condition of animals landed and compared these observations with national reports submitted to the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The presence of a foreign observer was intended to deter misreporting and to produce a secondary, independent data stream.
- The arrangements were reciprocal. Countries exchanged observers to each other’s facilities—an important design feature that transformed the mechanism into a bilateral or multilateral confidence‑building practice rather than a unidirectional surveillance tool.

Geographic and political context
- The schemes targeted regions with active, land‑based whaling: the Southern Hemisphere through the Australia–South Africa exchange; the North Atlantic via Canada–Iceland–Norway; and the North Pacific through the Japan–United States arrangement. These were areas where station locations and national industry practices meant that on‑site verification was feasible and meaningful.
- The IOSs emerged against a background of contestation within the IWC over quotas, species conservation and the accuracy of national catch reports. Questions about compliance and potential deliberate underreporting were part of broader diplomatic friction among whaling and anti‑whaling states.

Measuring impact: the Royal Society assessment
- A substantial finding in this history is the Royal Society’s assessment that the introduction of IOS observers coincided with an improvement in the quality of reported catch data. Crucially, this change occurred without contemporaneous major regulatory reform—suggesting that the improved reporting was driven by the presence of observers rather than by new legal obligations.
- The Royal Society’s standing as a respected scientific institution lends weight to the interpretation that reporting was more accurate post‑IOS. The implication drawn by the Society and others is stark: false or incomplete reporting may have been widespread in some whaling sectors prior to observer deployment.

Policy implications and lessons for governance design
- Observer schemes are an effective non‑legislative compliance tool. By creating an independent, verifiable record and increasing the perceived probability of detection, observers can deter deliberate misreporting and improve the informational basis for management decisions.
- Reciprocity matters. Exchange mechanisms that require states to host and supply observers create symmetrical obligations and reduce the sense of external imposition; this fosters political acceptability and mutual oversight.
- IOS as a replicable model. The observer concept has clear transferability to other resource‑monitoring regimes—fisheries, forestry, wildlife trade—where independent, in‑field verification can address information asymmetries that undercut regulatory regimes.

Limitations and caveats
- Access dependence: Observers are only as effective as the access permitted by host states. Restrictions on areas, times, or activities undermine the scheme.
- Coverage and intensity: Partial or intermittent observer coverage leaves gaps that can be exploited; adequate sampling design and resourcing are required to make results representative.
- Observer independence and capacity: Training, institutional independence, and the integrity of deploying organizations determine data quality. Observers appointed by parties with a stake in outcomes risk compromising neutrality.
- Scope of influence: Improved reporting strengthens the evidence base but does not by itself reconcile disputes over allowable catch levels or policy choices about conservation versus development priorities.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although the IOS originated in a niche environmental regime, it has instructive resonance for Indian strategic practice. India’s maritime interests—its fisheries, coastal security, and commitments in multilateral maritime governance—face similar challenges of information asymmetry, resource competition and the need for credible verification. Key lessons for India’s policy design include:
- Institutionalizing verification mechanisms can be an effective complement to legal instruments. Where enforcement capacity or political consensus is limited, observer‑style arrangements can bolster transparency and build confidence among states and stakeholders.
- Reciprocity and co‑ownership of monitoring enhance acceptability. In regional settings such as the Indian Ocean, cooperative observer arrangements (reciprocal deployment, joint training, shared data protocols) could build trust among littoral states and non‑state actors.
- Investing in observer capacity and independence is critical. For India to export or host credible monitoring frameworks—whether for fisheries, marine pollution, or seabed activities—technical training, transparent reporting channels and robust institutional safeguards are required.

Conclusion
The IOS experience within the IWC shows that relatively modest institutional innovations—independent on‑site observation, reciprocal deployment, and scientifically credible reporting—can yield substantial improvements in compliance data. For scholars and practitioners of international organization and national security alike, IOS exemplifies how transparency architecture can be designed to reduce strategic uncertainty and enhance governance without immediate recourse to coercive regulation. For India, the lesson is practical: verification by presence is a potent tool in the repertoire of transparent, confidence‑building measures in maritime governance and beyond.

### 7.X The International Whaling Commission: Institutional Gridlock and Lessons for Indian Strategic Culture

Overview  
The International Whaling Commission (IWC) has become a paradigmatic case of how profound normative cleavages within an international organization can produce institutional paralysis. At its core lies a binary dispute: one camp pressing for renewed utilisation of cetaceans (commercial whaling) and another insisting on absolute protection for whales. This dispute has not only dominated the Commission’s agenda but, according to scholars and conservationists, has prevented the IWC from addressing other grave threats to cetacean survival—ship strikes, pollution, habitat loss and climate change. For students of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the IWC episode offers lessons about multilateral design, the management of contested norms, and the need to insulate technical, cross-sectoral cooperation from intractable political contestation.

The conflict within the IWC and its institutional effects  
- Bipolarity of purpose: The IWC, founded under the 1946 Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and best known for the 1982 commercial moratorium, now contains two almost irreconcilable constituencies—pro-whaling states and conservation states. Their dispute over core purpose (use versus preservation) has overwhelmed routine governance.  
- Operational consequences: This polarisation produces repeated deadlock in decision-making, weakens collective scientific programmes, and redirects scarce political capital toward the hunting debate. The result is a Commission that struggles to pursue a broader conservation agenda even where there is technical consensus or urgent need.  
- The “logjam”: Observers, including conservation NGOs summarized in media reports, characterise this situation as a “logjam” — a blocking effect in which a single issue freezes institutional capacity to respond to other, non-hunting threats.

Scholarly prognosis: reform, fragmentation, or hybridisation  
Oran Young and eight other scholars argue that those institutional pressures make change inevitable. Their logic is straightforward: when a global forum is dominated by a single polarising issue, actors seeking alternative outcomes will either (a) push for institutional reform to broaden mandate and reduce blocking behavior, (b) withdraw to establish or join alternative/regional arrangements, or (c) create hybrid regimes combining elements of global and regional governance. Applied to whaling, the scholars predict three plausible pathways:  
1. A reformed IWC that reconciles use and protection through new governance mechanisms;  
2. Fragmentation, whereby pro-whaling states exit or marginalise themselves in favour of bodies like NAMMCO (the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission) or other regional commissions;  
3. A hybrid regime in which some states remain in a reformed IWC while others pursue regional arrangements or bilateral agreements allowing limited whaling under different rules.

NAMMCO and regional alternatives  
NAMMCO exemplifies the regional alternative some whaling states favour. Regional or issue-specific bodies can avoid global political gridlock by creating more homogeneous membership and tailored mandates. However, fragmentation risks losing global scientific coordination, diluting universal norms, and producing a patchwork of rules that complicates enforcement and monitoring.

Conservationists’ critique: the neglected threats beyond hunting  
Conservation advocates argue the IWC’s fixation on hunting has come at the expense of attention to non-hunting drivers of cetacean decline:  
- Ship strikes and bycatch;  
- Chemical and noise pollution;  
- Habitat degradation and cumulative ecosystem pressures;  
- Climate-change–driven shifts in prey distribution and migration patterns.  
The baiji (Yangtze river dolphin), often cited as a sentinel extinction, illustrates how layered human pressures—not hunting alone—can drive species to disappearance. Conservationists contend the IWC cannot effectively tackle these multidimensional threats while the hunting debate monopolises its agenda.

Policy implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
For India—whose strategic culture prizes multilateral engagement, a rules-based order, and an expanding conception of security that increasingly embraces ecological dimensions—the IWC case offers practical lessons:

1. Protect technical domains from zero-sum politics  
   - Where possible, insulate scientific and technical cooperation (stock assessments, threat-mapping, mitigation technologies) from politicised treaty disputes. This can be accomplished through independent scientific panels, separate working groups, or formal “firewalls” between normative disputes and technical programmes.

2. Support mandate clarity and flexible institutional design  
   - Advocate institutional rules that allow agenda-plurality: a clear separation between fundamental treaty revision and routine conservation measures, faster procedures for noncontroversial technical decisions, and conflict-resolution mechanisms to prevent minority vetoes from stalling action.

3. Promote cross-sectoral, transboundary governance  
   - Non-hunting threats require cooperation beyond fisheries and conservation ministries: ports and shipping, pollution control, climate diplomacy and regional security actors. India should push for integrated maritime governance that links environmental fora with maritime security and trade institutions.

4. Engage in regional and hybrid solutions strategically  
   - Recognise the utility of regional arrangements (e.g., NAMMCO-model bodies) for operational issues while defending the value of global coordination on shared scientific standards, monitoring, and norm-setting.

5. Build domestic capacities that reinforce multilateral credibility  
   - Strengthen India’s marine science capacities, threat-response capabilities (ship-routing, noise mitigation, pollution control), and channels for technical assistance to regional partners—actions that increase India’s leverage in multilateral negotiations and serve national maritime-security interests.

Concluding observations  
The IWC’s stalemate illustrates a broader organisational pathology: when an international body is captured by a single, existential dispute, its ability to address cross-cutting, technically complex threats is sharply reduced. For Indian policymakers and strategists, the imperative is twofold: (a) design and support institutional arrangements that can decouple technical conservation work from intractable politics; and (b) invest in cross-sectoral, regional and scientific capacities that protect both biodiversity and maritime security. The lessons extend beyond cetaceans—any area where ecological risk intersects with contested normative claims will test the resilience of multilateral governance.

### Allegations of politicising science within the International Whaling Commission (IWC)

Editorial note: the material summarised here is drawn from a draft section that originally contained no citations (tagged June 2010). The narrative below preserves the factual claims and sequence presented in that draft, but many assertions and quotations—especially those marked in the original as “[citation needed]”—require verification against primary IWC documents (Scientific Committee reports, Plenary minutes), contemporary press reports and secondary analyses. Key documents to consult include the IWC Scientific Committee reports (early 1990s), the IWC Plenary records (1991–1994), texts on the Revised Management Procedure (RMP) and Revised Management Scheme (RMS), and contemporaneous statements by IWC officials.

1. The basic contention: science versus politics
- A recurrent critique voiced by pro‑whaling governments is that IWC Plenary decision-making has become politicised: decisions, they argue, are driven by “political and emotional” considerations rather than by the technical advice produced by the IWC Scientific Committee. This criticism centres on a perceived divergence between the Committee’s stock assessments and advice on sustainable catches, and Plenary’s policy choices—most notably the maintenance of a blanket moratorium on commercial whaling that began in 1986.
- The accusation of politicisation is not merely rhetorical. It points to a structural tension common in many international organisations: a technical body produces evidence-based options, while a political body must weigh that evidence against values, public opinion and interstate bargaining asymmetries.

2. Scientific Committee findings (1991) and the pro‑whaling argument
- After the 1986 moratorium the IWC Scientific Committee undertook renewed stock assessments and was tasked with developing methods to estimate safe catch limits. At the IWC meeting in 1991 the Committee reported population estimates for minke whales that were often cited by pro‑whaling states: roughly 761,000 in Antarctic waters, about 87,000 in the northeast Atlantic and approximately 25,000 in the North Pacific (these figures should be verified against the 1991 Committee report).
- Based on its modelling and the data available at that time, the Scientific Committee submitted that an annual take of around 2,000 minke whales would not, in principle, endanger those populations. Pro‑whaling governments used that finding to argue that the IWC’s moratorium had become an unduly rigid, non‑scientific prohibition on sustainable use.
- Their broader normative argument was that the IWC had shifted away from its original mandate—regulating a harvest to ensure sustainability—and towards an approach that effectively treated whales as having an entitlement to absolute protection from commercial killing.

3. Plenary response: caution, governance deficits and the RMS/RMP distinction
- Despite the Scientific Committee’s assessment, the IWC Plenary declined to lift the moratorium. Plenary delegates cited the need for more thorough evaluation of allowable‑catch formulas and for agreed minimum data standards, survey guidelines, and effective monitoring and inspection measures before any commercial quota could be authorised.
- In technical response, the IWC adopted a computerized formula—the Revised Management Procedure (RMP)—in 1994 (work began earlier). The RMP was a quantitative algorithm designed to translate abundance estimates and uncertainty into potential catch limits. However, the IWC specified that the RMP alone was insufficient: it had to be coupled with an inspection, monitoring and control regime to form the Revised Management Scheme (RMS).
- The RMS therefore comprised two components: the RMP (a scientific/technical procedure) and a set of governance safeguards (data standards, surveys, monitoring, inspection, compliance mechanisms). Plenary agreement on the full RMS proved politically fraught and elusive.

4. Political obstacles, resignations and dissent
- The struggle to agree the RMS exposed deep political divisions. Some anti‑whaling states and NGOs rejected the RMS on principle (arguing it would provide a pathway back to commercial whaling), while some pro‑whaling states argued the safeguards being demanded were excessive or obstructive.
- Institutional strain was visible in personnel decisions: in June 1993 Dr Philip Hammond, then Chair of the Scientific Committee, resigned in protest, reportedly citing what he saw as contempt for the Committee’s recommendations. Similarly, Ray Gambell, an IWC Secretary at the time, is on record as acknowledging that a commercial catch of minke whales could be consistent with non‑endangerment of stocks—an admission used by critics to argue that Plenary politics, not science, was preventing a regulated return to commercial harvest.
- These developments—the public resignation of a senior scientist and contentious statements by Secretariat officials—became emblematic of the science–policy tension inside the IWC.

5. Opt‑out, withdrawals and unilateral returns to whaling
- The IWC treaty contains procedural mechanisms with political consequences. A formal objection mechanism allows a member to register an objection to a resolution and thus lawfully opt out of its effects. Norway formally objected to the moratorium and, invoking that right, resumed commercial whaling in 1993. Other states have at various times withdrawn from or threatened to withdraw from the IWC over the moratorium, arguing that it contravened measures designed to allow sustainable harvests; Canada’s past withdrawal has been cited in this regard.
- Such legal avenues complicate governance: even where there is a Plenary majority favouring conservation, treaty design permits states to contest or bypass restrictive measures. That, in turn, undermines the ability of the organisation to present a uniform regime of resource governance.

6. Stakeholders and the politics of legitimacy
- The controversy involves a constellation of actors: pro‑whaling states, anti‑whaling states, non‑IWC whaling countries, the IWC Scientific Committee (technical secretariat), the IWC Plenary (political body), NGOs (such as Sea Shepherd and Greenpeace) and national publics. Each stakeholder brings different weight to bear—scientific authority, normative claims about animal welfare, domestic political pressures, or enforcement capacities.
- Anti‑whaling NGOs have generally opposed the RMS (arguing it would re‑enable commercial whaling); pro‑whaling states argue that the Scientific Committee’s technical advice is sufficient to permit a controlled resumption. These conflicting positions turn the IWC into a forum where scientific evidence, ethical values and domestic politics collide.

7. Institutional implications and lessons for other national security actors
- The IWC episode is illustrative of wider problems that arise when technical expert bodies and political organs inhabit the same institutional framework without clear delineation of roles and expectations. Key points for policymakers, including those involved in India’s strategic and security policymaking, are:
  - The credibility of international regimes depends not only on robust science but also on transparent, agreed governance—monitoring, inspection and sanctions—that give states confidence in compliance.
  - Treaty design matters: opt‑out and objection clauses can preserve state sovereignty but can also weaken collective rules if used strategically.
  - Public legitimacy and NGO activism shape outcomes: norms and public opinion can translate into political constraints that override technical recommendations.
  - Institutional strain—resignations of scientific chairs, public disagreements—signals legitimacy deficits that can impair an organisation’s authority and the willingness of states to comply.
  - For states negotiating environmental or resource regimes, ensuring that the technical advice is clearly separated from political decisionmaking (and that both are transparent and well‑documented) reduces accusations of politicisation.

8. Methodological caveat and recommendations for the manuscript
- The original draft contained multiple “[citation needed]” notes and a general lack of primary sourcing. To strengthen the section’s credibility and utility for readers interested in policy implications, the following should be done:
  - Incorporate primary IWC materials: Scientific Committee reports (1991 and subsequent years), Plenary minutes (1991–1994), RMP technical papers, and formal statements by member states.
  - Corroborate specific quotations and dates (e.g., Gambell’s comments; Hammond’s June 1993 resignation; Norway’s 1993 resumption under formal objection).
  - Clarify terminology and actors: specify which states are characterised as “pro‑whaling” and which are “non‑IWC whaling countries” to avoid ambiguity.
  - Distinguish carefully (and explicitly) between Scientific Committee findings (technical advice) and Plenary resolutions (political/legal outcomes).

Conclusion: relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India, the IWC case is a compact lesson in negotiating the science–policy interface in international regimes. Whether dealing with maritime environmental governance, fisheries, or dual‑use technologies with security implications, Indian negotiators confront similar trade‑offs: trust in scientific assessments, the need for verifiable monitoring regimes, the political salience of domestic public opinion and NGOs, and the risk that treaty design can permit unilateral departures.
- A strategic culture that prizes credibility and compliance in multilateral regimes should therefore prioritise (a) rigorous technical input, (b) transparent governance arrangements (monitoring, inspection, penalties), and (c) careful attention to treaty language on objections and opt‑outs. Doing so reduces the space in which accusations of politicisation can be weaponised by adversaries or domestic constituencies, thereby protecting both policy efficacy and national security interests.

### Case study: The International Whaling Commission — membership politics, aid diplomacy and the politics of legitimacy

(Image caption: adult and sub-adult minke whale dragged aboard the Nisshin Maru, a Japanese whaling vessel.)

This case study examines how a technical, species‑management body – the International Whaling Commission (IWC) – evolved into a forum where conservation science, animal welfare, development aid and diplomatic strategy intersect. The IWC’s trajectory since the late 20th century illustrates how membership expansion, non‑state actor mobilization, and assistance‑for‑support allegations can reshape multilateral governance and raise questions about legitimacy that are directly relevant to any state’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Mandate and historical baseline
- The IWC was constituted to “safeguard whale stocks for future generations,” with a membership originally dominated by 15 whale‑hunting (range) states. Its rules require super‑majorities (75%) for major measures such as the 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling.
- The moratorium’s adoption depended on a large affirmative coalition: conservationists report that roughly three‑quarters of members voted in favour in 1986.

2. Membership expansion and NGO recruitment
- From the late 1970s/early 1980s many non‑whaling and even landlocked countries joined the IWC. This expansion was actively cultivated by environmental NGOs — notably WWF under Sir Peter Scott — which described the pre‑reform IWC as a “butchers’ club” and organized recruitment campaigns to secure votes for anti‑whaling measures.
- NGO‑driven recruitment demonstrates how non‑state actors can change the composition of multilateral bodies to favour particular policy outcomes. Such campaigns were decisive in securing the moratorium but also introduced new political dynamics into the IWC.

3. Allegations of inducements and aid‑for‑votes
- Accusations of “packing” the IWC or buying votes emerged as both sides sought to recruit new members. Critics alleged that conservation NGOs or states used financial inducements to procure votes; defenders argued recruitment was legitimate persuasion and capacity assistance.
- Specific allegations in public accounts include:
  - Claims that WWF or its leaders financially influenced China’s accession (a biographer of Sir Peter Scott reports a purported promise of US$1 million for a panda reserve).
  - Michael Tillman, a former US IWC Commissioner, observed that it was “common knowledge” conservation groups had financially supported some countries’ entries.
  - Environmental Investigation Agency reported employing Lord Ashcroft to secure Belize’s anti‑whaling vote; Ashcroft allegedly paid Belize’s IWC subscription fees.
  - Conversely, Japan has been accused of offering development aid in return for IWC support. Japan itself publishes significant aid figures (cited in this context as US$320 million to several Caribbean, African and Pacific states), and Caribbean delegations have frequently sided with Japan since 2001.
- Some local officials and regional leaders acknowledged pragmatic quid‑pro‑quo dynamics. Others, especially Caribbean delegates, protested being portrayed as “buyable,” noting the offence such portrayals create for economically vulnerable states.

4. Empirical patterns and contested correlations
- Analyses of voting records and aid flows point to correlations between aid receipts and voting patterns, particularly in small island and Caribbean states, although causation is contested and politically fraught.
- Since 2000, 29 new countries joined the IWC; the post‑2000 cohort is reported as 18 pro‑whaling and 11 anti‑whaling. Landlocked members now include nine states with mixed voting (e.g., Mali and Mongolia reportedly pro‑whaling; Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia, Switzerland, San Marino anti‑whaling). These patterns demonstrate the capacity of non‑range states to influence species management regimes.

5. Procedural contestation: secret ballots and transparency
- Japan has advocated secret‑ballot voting in the IWC to reduce public accusations and external monitoring of how states vote; anti‑whaling states oppose secret ballots on accountability grounds.
- The debate exemplifies a classic transparency‑versus‑influence trade‑off: secret ballots can protect delegates from coercion but can also obscure vote inducements and undermine public accountability. Critics note possible hypocrisy when states favour secret ballots in one forum but insist on openness in another (for example, comparisons with voting practices in CITES have been raised).

6. Legal and political loopholes enabling continued whaling
- Even after the 1986 commercial moratorium, political and legal devices allowed continued catches: some whaling was conducted “under objection” to the moratorium; other takes were justified under national “scientific permits.” These provisions reveal how formal rules can contain loopholes that states exploit to preserve perceived national interests.

7. Normative polarization: sustainable‑use vs. animal‑welfare framing
- The IWC’s politics are not reducible to a single axis of science. Anti‑whaling states and NGOs often invoke both scientific uncertainty about stock recovery and broader animal‑welfare grounds to argue against resuming commercial whaling. Pro‑whaling states emphasise sustainable‑use principles, cultural practices, and the need to correct public misconceptions (e.g., surveys showing the public often conflates endangered status with all whale species).
- Coastal fishing interests sometimes frame whales as competitors for fish stocks; this claim is disputed scientifically but matters politically in some range states.
- The conflict illustrates how scientific evidence interacts with moral claims and national identity, producing durable normative cleavages that science alone cannot settle.

8. Local impacts and alternative livelihoods
- Critics of inducement politics also point to missed opportunities for development: whale‑watching and other non‑extractive uses are frequently proposed as economic alternatives, but they require investment, market access, and technical support — elements often lacking in aid packages focused on short‑term diplomatic returns.
- Local resentment in some Caribbean jurisdictions frames aid‑for‑vote tactics as a continuation of colonial‑era patronage rather than genuine partnership.

9. Reciprocity and symmetry in influence
- Both pro‑ and anti‑whaling blocs have leveraged aid and persuasion. Major anti‑whaling donors (the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand) also provide development assistance and diplomatic pressure, making simple attributions of impropriety asymmetric or partisan. The result is mutual delegitimisation: each side accuses the other of corrupting institutional membership and outcomes.

10. Key implications for multilateral governance and strategic culture
- Allegations of vote‑buying and inducements undermine the perceived legitimacy of the IWC and complicate consensus‑based conservation outcomes.
- Membership expansion beyond traditional stakeholders alters power balances and can decouple an organisation’s operational focus from its original mandate.
- Procedural reforms (e.g., secret ballots) carry trade‑offs between transparency and delegate protection; decisions about procedure shape both perceptions of legitimacy and the feasibility of collective action.
- The whaling debate demonstrates that sustainable‑management frameworks and animal‑rights claims will continue to clash; policy responses therefore require not only robust science but also careful normative and diplomatic management.
- Aid diplomacy intertwined with environmental politics indicates that resolving such disputes requires transparency in development assistance and an integrated approach that links conservation science with development policy and local economic planning.

11. Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Lessons from the IWC are germane to India in three respects:
  - Multilateral practice and legitimacy: As India deepens its engagement in environmental and resource regimes, it must weigh recruitment and coalition tactics against long‑term institutional legitimacy. Transactional inducements that produce short‑term gains can damage norms of transparency central to India’s image as a responsible rising power.
  - Aid, influence and regional diplomacy: The IWC shows how development assistance can be mobilised for diplomatic objectives. India’s own development diplomacy (e.g., lines of credit, capacity building, and technical assistance in the Indian Ocean and neighbourhood) should be calibrated to avoid perceptions of quid‑pro‑quo that could undermine soft‑power gains or invite reciprocal accusations.
  - Science, sovereignty and normative framing: Environmental governance often mixes empirical uncertainty with moral claims. India’s policy posture should combine rigorous, transparent scientific assessments with clear normative positioning (sustainable use, biodiversity protection, or welfare‑based arguments) tailored to coalition‑building needs. On procedural reforms (e.g., voting secrecy, transparency standards), India can promote norms that balance accountability with protection for smaller states from coercion.
- Practically, India should:
  - Advocate transparent linkages between development assistance and policy dialogue (explicit, recorded capacity‑building projects rather than discretionary packages tied to votes).
  - Support technical investments enabling alternative livelihoods (e.g., whale‑watching where feasible or coastal resource diversification) as credible complements to conservation diplomacy.
  - Use multilateral forums to advance rules that reduce loopholes (e.g., tighter definitions of “scientific” permits) to prevent exploitative legal workarounds that erode governance credibility.

Conclusion — normative and strategic stakes
The IWC saga underscores that environmental multilateralism is never purely technical. Membership politics, NGO mobilisation, and aid diplomacy can decisively reshape outcomes and public perceptions. For states concerned with legitimacy and long‑term influence — including India — the challenge is to integrate science, transparent development cooperation and principled diplomacy so that engagement in international regimes advances both normative commitments and strategic interests without sacrificing institutional credibility.

Key takeaways
- Allegations of inducements weaken institutional legitimacy and complicate consensus governance.
- Membership expansion can change an organisation’s politics; non‑range states matter.
- Procedural design (secret ballots, voting thresholds) has substantive political consequences.
- Resolving disputes requires both scientific clarity and transparent development policy — a lesson with direct relevance for India’s strategic culture and its international engagement.

### 5.x The United States, Domestic Law and the Enforcement of IWC Decisions

This brief case-study shows how a single powerful state translated domestic law into effective leverage over an international conservation regime — the International Whaling Commission (IWC) — and the implications that follow for states, including India, that seek to shape or rely upon multilateral institutions.

Background: the 1986 moratorium and the enforcement gap
- The IWC’s 1986 moratorium on commercial whaling is a watershed in global marine conservation: it converted what had often been a weakly enforced multilateral limit into an internationally recognized ban. Yet the IWC lacked robust, centralized enforcement tools of its own.
- In this context, the United States deployed national statutes to fill the enforcement gap by imposing tangible economic and access penalties on states judged to be undermining IWC conservation measures.

Key U.S. legal instruments
- Pelly Amendment (to the Fishermen’s Protective Act of 1967, incorporated into U.S. practice in 1971): it authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to certify that nationals of a foreign country are diminishing the effectiveness of an international fishery conservation program. Once certified, the President may prohibit imports of that country’s fishery products into the United States.
  - Practical logic: link compliance with multilateral conservation rules to market access.
- Packwood–Magnuson Amendment (1979): strengthened the stick. When the Secretary of Commerce certifies a foreign country under this amendment, the Secretary of State must reduce that country’s access to U.S. fishing allocations by at least 50%.
  - Dual effect: certification under Packwood–Magnuson automatically functions as a Pelly certification; trade and access penalties operate in tandem.

Political dynamics and perceptions
- The U.S. willingness to act unilaterally (that is, using its domestic statutes without multilateral enforcement procedures) produced contrasting reactions:
  - Pro‑whaling governments denounced such measures as “bullying” or extraterritorial coercion.
  - Environmentalists and conservation NGOs praised U.S. action as necessary to give teeth to otherwise toothless IWC rules.
- The effectiveness of these measures thus depended on U.S. political will; application varied with domestic politics and foreign-policy priorities.

Empirical effects: selected episodes
- 1974–1975: U.S. pressure is credited with contributing to Japanese and Soviet compliance with IWC quotas for that season.
- December 1978: threats of Pelly certification induced accession or better compliance by several states — Chile, South Korea and Peru acceded to the IWC; Spain began observing a disputed fin‑whale quota it had objected to.
- 1980s: threatened application of Packwood–Magnuson/Pelly provisions led South Korea to follow IWC guidance on harpoon practices (avoiding certain non‑explosive “cold” harpoons) and contributed to Taiwan (Republic of China) banning whaling in 1981.
- 1986 corpus: scholars and practitioners argue that without sustained U.S. backing — including these domestic enforcement tools — the 1986 moratorium might have been substantially weakened, with countries such as Iceland, Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union potentially opting out or continuing commercial whaling.

Broader pattern and comparative resonance
- The Pelly and Packwood–Magnuson tools exemplify a broader technique: linking international-legal commitments to unilateral domestic penalties (trade prohibitions, access restrictions). This is analogous to other regimes that use trade leverage to enforce conservation, for example CITES’ trade controls.
- The approach is particularly potent against smaller or export‑dependent states for whom U.S. markets or U.S. fishing access are economically significant.

Implications for multilateralism and for India’s strategic calculation
- Institutional implications:
  - National statutes can effectively internationalize enforcement, but they also shift compliance from collective enforcement to the discretion of powerful states. This reduces the purely multilateral character of compliance and creates system vulnerabilities if that state’s policy shifts.
  - Such unilateral enforcement can produce diplomatic friction and feed narratives of great‑power coercion.
- Policy lessons for India:
  - India’s strategic culture — which prizes sovereignty and multilateralism but also recognizes the utility of pragmatic leverage — can draw several lessons. Domestic measures that create credible costs for non‑compliance can enhance the effectiveness of multilateral rules, but their utility depends on consistent political will and careful diplomatic management.
  - If India aspires to shape environmental or resource regimes, it may combine coalition‑building in multilateral fora with domestic instruments (e.g., trade or access restrictions) to create credible enforcement incentives; yet it must weigh reputational costs and the risk of reciprocal measures.
  - Reliance on a single external actor for enforcement of international norms is fragile: India’s policy should therefore aim to institutionalize credibility through multilateral mechanisms where possible, while retaining selective national tools as complements rather than substitutes.

Conclusion
The U.S. use of the Pelly and Packwood–Magnuson instruments transformed the enforcement landscape of the IWC and illustrates how domestic law can be mobilized to produce international compliance. For scholars of strategic culture and for policymakers in states like India, this episode highlights the tradeoffs between unilateral leverage and multilateral legitimacy, and the centrality of political will in converting legal authority into practical conservation outcomes.

### The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO)

Background: the IWC moratorium and political backlash  
In 1982 the International Whaling Commission (IWC) adopted a global moratorium on commercial whaling, a decision that became effective in the mid-1980s and reshaped the international regime for cetacean conservation. The moratorium generated sharp political friction among states with long-standing whaling traditions. Iceland, explicitly dissatisfied with the IWC’s zero-catch stance, withdrew in protest; prior to withdrawal Reykjavik had warned it would leave should the moratorium be extended. Japan and Norway also issued public threats to quit the IWC during this period. These contests over the IWC’s normative reach and management prescriptions set the stage for regional institutional responses.

Formation and founding instruments  
In April 1992 those political tensions culminated in the creation of the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO). The new body was established under the “Agreement on Cooperation in Research, Conservation and Management of Marine Mammals in the North Atlantic.” Founding participants were the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Iceland and Norway — a notable mix that included non-sovereign or self-governing territories (the Faroes and Greenland) alongside sovereign states. NAMMCO’s creation was therefore as much a political statement about regional control as it was a technical arrangement for collaborative science.

Motives, rhetoric and institutional positioning  
The drafters of the agreement and spokespeople for the founding governments framed NAMMCO as a corrective to what they perceived as the IWC’s protectionist tendencies. In the words of Icelandic representative Guðmundur Eiríksson, one impetus for NAMMCO was explicit dissatisfaction with the IWC’s zero-catch quota. NAMMCO was presented as a regional, science-based alternative that would allow North Atlantic states and territories to manage marine mammal resources according to local ecological knowledge, cooperative research, and socio-economic considerations tied to coastal communities.

Mandate, membership and technical emphasis  
NAMMCO’s remit covers a suite of North Atlantic marine mammals — minke whales, pilot whales, narwhal, and other species relevant to the region’s fisheries and cultures. Unlike the global, conservation-driven posture of the IWC, NAMMCO emphasizes regional stock assessment, joint research programs, and management recommendations grounded in the best available science as interpreted by its members. The inclusion of the Faroe Islands and Greenland as institutional actors reinforces the Commission’s regional character and the political importance of allowing sub-state or self-governing entities a voice in resource governance.

Legal and legitimacy dynamics  
Technically, NAMMCO did not contravene IWC membership obligations; it was framed to avoid direct legal conflict. Nonetheless the Commission posed a significant challenge to the IWC’s legitimacy as the primary global authority on whaling. By creating an alternate forum that produced its own scientific assessments and management prescriptions — often more permissive than IWC rules — NAMMCO undercut the uniformity of international norms. The result was institutional fragmentation: a regional governance body operating alongside a global regime, each claiming scientific credibility and normative authority.

Practical consequences: management, quotas and outcomes  
In practical terms, NAMMCO enabled members to pursue regulated hunting policies inconsistent with the IWC’s moratorium. This had concrete management outcomes: regional quotas and catch programs were defended as scientifically justified and culturally necessary, allowing continued exploitation under NAMMCO guidance even where the IWC prohibited commercial take. (See, for example, comparative data on Norwegian minke whale management: Figure — Norwegian minke whale quotas (1994–2006) and catches (1946–2005), which illustrates how national quota-setting and catches evolved in the shadow of global regulation.)

Broader significance and lessons for strategic policy  
The NAMMCO case illustrates several durable features of international institutional politics with direct relevance to strategic culture and national security policy:

- Regional alternatives as sovereign agency: States (and sub-state actors) confronted with global norms they view as inimical to domestic interests will seek institutional alternatives that preserve decision-making authority.
- Science as legitimating resource: Competing fora invoke scientific expertise to validate divergent management choices; technical credibility becomes a tool of political legitimation.
- Institutional fragmentation: The coexistence of regional and global bodies can erode the perceived authority of universal regimes without immediately violating treaty law, producing durable governance pluralism.
- Policy implications for states: For countries crafting strategic policy, NAMMCO is a reminder that governance strategies can combine legal subtlety with political signaling — creating organizations that are formally compliant yet substantively contestatory.

Conclusion  
NAMMCO’s formation in 1992 was both a response to the IWC’s 1980s-era moratorium and an assertion of regional control grounded in scientific management and local socioeconomic priorities. While not a juridical breach of the IWC, NAMMCO challenged the global Commission’s moral and epistemic authority and exemplified how regional institutions can reconfigure governance landscapes. For analysts of strategic culture, the episode underscores how states employ institutional design — including participation by non-sovereign entities — to reconcile international norms with domestic imperatives and to assert alternative sources of legitimacy.
