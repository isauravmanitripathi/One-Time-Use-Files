# International maritime law

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) constitutes the cornerstone of contemporary international maritime law. Often referred to simply as the Law of the Sea Convention or the Law of the Sea Treaty, UNCLOS provides a comprehensive legal framework that governs virtually all activities on, under and above the world’s oceans — from navigation and fisheries to seabed resource exploitation and marine environmental protection. For any state that seeks to develop a coherent maritime strategy, UNCLOS is both the juridical baseline and a political architecture shaping behaviour, rights and obligations at sea.

Background and scope
- UNCLOS emerged from the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), which ran from 1973 to 1982. It replaced and consolidated the fragmented regime that had evolved from the 1958 multilateral treaties on the high seas.
- The Convention entered into force in 1994 after reaching the condition of 60 ratifications; Guyana’s ratification supplied the sixtieth instrument required for entry into force.
- UNCLOS is widely accepted: as of October 2024, 169 sovereign states plus the European Union are parties. All major powers are parties with one notable exception — the United States has not ratified the Convention, though many U.S. practices conform to UNCLOS norms.

Core legal instruments and principles
UNCLOS defines a set of maritime zones and legal regimes that allocate rights and responsibilities between coastal states and the international community. Principal definitions include:
- Territorial sea: sovereignty of the coastal state, subject to the right of innocent passage for foreign vessels.
- Contiguous zone: limited enforcement jurisdiction to prevent or punish infringement of customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary laws within the territorial sea.
- Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): up to 200 nautical miles from baselines; coastal states have sovereign rights for exploration, exploitation and management of natural resources (living and non-living) and jurisdiction over certain economic activities.
- Continental shelf: rights to the seabed and subsoil resources of the natural prolongation of the land mass, including a regime for claims beyond 200 nm based on scientific criteria.
- High seas: waters beyond national jurisdiction where freedom of navigation, overflight and certain activities are preserved.

Two normative concepts embedded in the Convention are particularly consequential:
- The principle of freedom of the seas, balanced against coastal-state rights, underpins navigation, commerce and naval operations.
- The “common heritage of mankind” principle applies to the seabed beyond national jurisdiction (the Area), prescribing that resources there be managed for the benefit of humankind as a whole and administered through institutional mechanisms.

Institutional architecture and operational actors
- The UN Secretary‑General receives instruments of ratification and, in an administrative capacity, supports meetings of states parties. The UN Secretariat, however, plays little direct operational role in implementing the substantive provisions of UNCLOS.
- Operational responsibilities fall largely to specialized and treaty bodies. Key actors include:
  - The International Maritime Organization (IMO): regulates shipping safety, pollution and maritime navigation standards.
  - The International Whaling Commission (IWC): governs whaling and species-specific conservation measures (though not a UNCLOS body, it interacts with the Convention’s conservation objectives).
  - The International Seabed Authority (ISA): established by UNCLOS to regulate mineral-related activities in the international seabed area and to operationalize the “common heritage” principle.

Dispute settlement and compliance mechanisms
UNCLOS provides a menu of dispute-resolution options intended to depoliticize maritime conflicts and offer legal predictability:
- The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) — a specialized tribunal created by UNCLOS.
- Arbitration under Annex VII of the Convention.
- Advisory and contentious jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in certain cases.
States may choose amongst these procedures subject to reservations in the Convention and declarations. The availability of legal routes has been important in settling delimitation, navigation and resource disputes, though enforcement ultimately depends on states’ willingness to comply and the broader geopolitical context.

Recent developments: biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction (BBNJ)
- In 2023, the international community reached an implementing agreement often called the High Seas Treaty or the BBNJ agreement. It is designed to operationalize conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdiction, thereby complementing UNCLOS rather than replacing it.
- The BBNJ instrument foresees measures such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), strengthened environmental-impact assessment (EIA) procedures for activities on the high seas, and mechanisms for equitable benefit-sharing. Once adopted and ratified, it will become an important implementing agreement under the UNCLOS framework.

Economic and environmental governance: the seabed and beyond
- The ISA regulates seabed mining in the Area, balancing access to mineral resources with environmental safeguards and obligations to ensure benefits for humankind. The regulation of deep seabed mining is an area of active political contestation and legal development.
- UNCLOS contains obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment, including pollution control, conservation of living resources and cooperation on scientific research.

Implementation challenges and contemporary pressures
Despite its breadth, UNCLOS faces practical and normative challenges:
- Enforcement deficits: monitoring, compliance and enforcement in vast ocean spaces remain difficult, especially beyond national jurisdiction.
- Capacity disparities: developing states often lack technical and financial capacity to implement UNCLOS obligations effectively, including scientific work to substantiate continental-shelf claims or to manage fisheries sustainably.
- Emerging activities and risks: deep-seabed mining, bioprospecting, climate-change‑driven shifts in maritime baselines and ecosystems, and new technologies raise questions that test the Convention’s existing legal categories.
- Geopolitics: uneven power relations and strategic competition can impede dispute settlement, cooperative management and multilateral decision‑making.

Implications for maritime security, fisheries and national strategy
UNCLOS is central to maritime security, fisheries management, environmental law and governance of the global commons. For states formulating maritime strategy — including India — the Convention is both a legal constraint and an enabling framework:
- It defines maritime entitlements that underpin resource access (EEZs, continental shelf) and operational freedom (navigation, overflight).
- It supplies legal mechanisms for dispute settlement and institutional venues (e.g., ISA) for multilateral management of resources beyond national jurisdiction.
- It shapes national policy: coastal‑state legislation, naval operations, fisheries enforcement and participation in multilateral conservation initiatives are framed by UNCLOS obligations and opportunities.

India’s position (strategic relevance)
- India is a party to UNCLOS and actively engages in its institutional processes. The Convention anchors India’s maritime claims, informs its fisheries and resource management regimes, and provides legal avenues for addressing disputes and protecting maritime interests.
- As a developing maritime power with interests in regional seas and the wider Indian Ocean, India faces the same implementation challenges common to many states: capacity-building needs, scientific requirements to substantiate seabed claims, and navigating the governance of emerging activities such as deep-seabed mining and biodiversity protection in areas beyond national jurisdiction.
- India’s strategic culture — which foregrounds maritime security, secure sea lines of communication and resource access — is therefore shaped by UNCLOS norms, by participation in bodies such as the ISA, and by evolving instruments like the BBNJ agreement.

Conclusion
UNCLOS is not merely a collection of rules; it is the legal and institutional grammar of the maritime order. For scholars and practitioners of national security — particularly those focused on India’s strategic culture — understanding UNCLOS is indispensable. It sets the terms on which maritime power is exercised, resources are governed, and the global ocean is managed. The Convention’s continuing evolution, through implementing agreements and institutional practice, will remain a central variable in national maritime strategies and in the contest to govern a common yet spatially fragmented global commons.

## Background: From "Freedom of the Seas" to UNCLOS

The contemporary law of the sea — as codified in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982) — represents a profound transformation of centuries-old maritime principles. Where early modern jurists defended a largely unregulated ocean common, the late twentieth century produced a dense legal regime that allocates zones of state authority, protects shared marine resources, and creates institutionalized means of dispute settlement. Understanding this evolution is essential to situating India’s maritime strategy and national-security policy in legal as well as geopolitical terms.

Historical origins and the "three-mile" regime
- The dominant doctrine from the seventeenth century was the resounding idea of mare liberum, or the freedom of the seas, most famously articulated by Hugo Grotius. Under this concept, the ocean broadly lay outside national sovereignty.
- Concomitantly, a much narrower conception of coastal control emerged: a limited belt of sea adjacent to the shore in which states exercised exclusive rights. By longstanding customary practice that became known as the "three-mile rule," coastal claims were generally restricted to a distance of about three nautical miles from the low-water mark.
- The three-mile limit was popularly rationalized as the distance a cannon from shore could reach. Dutch jurist Cornelius van Bynkershoek provided a juridical articulation of this practice by grounding maritime jurisdiction in the practical reach of coastal enforcement — an early example of how technological and operational factors shaped legal norms.

Drivers of change: resources, fisheries and pollution control
- The turning point toward extended maritime jurisdiction was driven less by abstract legal theory than by concrete material and environmental interests. As mineral exploitation of continental shelves, wider-scale fisheries, and concerns about cross-boundary pollution became pressing, many states sought greater regulatory control seaward of the traditional territorial belt.
- The interwar League of Nations conference at The Hague (1930) attempted to address these questions but failed to produce agreement. The momentum for unilateral action continued after World War II.
- In 1945, President Truman issued a proclamation asserting U.S. jurisdiction over the natural resources of its continental shelf, invoking customary rules of resource protection. This unilateral move catalysed a wider pattern of state practice: other coastal states adopted similar measures to secure seabed resources and fisheries.
- Latin American practice in the immediate postwar period was particularly influential: between 1946 and 1950 Chile, Peru and Ecuador declared controls approximating 200 nautical miles to protect rich fisheries associated with the Humboldt Current. Parallel moves by other states extended territorial seas to 12 nautical miles in many cases.

The accumulation of practice and the need for codification
- By the late 1960s state practice was heterogeneous: in 1967 some 25 states still maintained the 3 nm limit, 66 had extended to 12 nm, and 8 claimed 200 nm. The diversity of claims and the rising economic and environmental stakes created strong incentives for a comprehensive, harmonizing treaty.
- UNCLOS (opened for signature in 1982; entered into force in 1994) was the response: it synthesized customary practices and negotiated innovations into a single, multifaceted legal order. Its provisions codified the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) up to 200 nautical miles and elaborated continental-shelf rights, while balancing coastal-state resource rights with navigation freedoms and other users’ interests.

Key legal constructs under UNCLOS
- Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ): The EEZ grants coastal states sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting, conserving and managing natural resources — both living and non-living — up to 200 nautical miles from the baseline. Importantly, the EEZ confers resource rights and management powers, but not full territorial sovereignty.
- Continental shelf: UNCLOS gives coastal states rights over the continental shelf for purposes of seabed resource exploitation even where the shelf extends beyond 200 nautical miles (subject to limits and submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf).
- The Area and the common heritage principle: Seabed areas beyond national jurisdiction — "the Area" — are managed under the doctrine of the common heritage of mankind. Mineral resources of the Area are subject to a regime intended to ensure equitable use and benefit-sharing.
- Dispute settlement institutions: UNCLOS established or reinforced mechanisms for peaceful resolution of maritime disputes, including recourse to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the International Court of Justice (ICJ), arbitration under Annex VII, and other procedures.

Limits and continuing legal-political issues
- UNCLOS does not, and was not designed to, resolve title disputes over land territory or to substitute for customary-law rules on acquisition and loss of territory. Sovereignty disputes — which often underpin competing maritime claims — therefore may persist even within the Convention’s framework.
- State practice continued to diverge for decades. As late as 15 July 2011, only Jordan formally retained the three-mile limit as a general standard; several small territories and constrained straits still use or retain the historical belt in limited situations (for instance certain Australian islands, parts of Belize, some Japanese straits, parts of Papua New Guinea, and some British Overseas Territories such as Gibraltar).

Contemporary practice and the global legal landscape
- Many coastal states now operate under the EEZ/continental-shelf regime set by UNCLOS. Dispute-settlement under the Convention — through ITLOS, ICJ, or arbitration — has become an important tool for delimitation and conflict management where EEZs or continental shelves overlap.
- Not all major maritime powers have ratified UNCLOS: most notably, as of 2024 the United States has not ratified the Convention, while generally accepting many of its provisions as reflective of customary international law. Even without universal ratification, the Convention’s norms have shaped state practice and maritime governance worldwide.
- UNCLOS aligns with broader international agendas: for example, United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14 (conserve and sustainably use the oceans) is consistent with the Convention’s legal architecture for marine conservation and sustainable use.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national-security policy
- The legal reconfiguration of maritime space materially expanded coastal states’ regulatory and economic control over adjacent seas. For India, a large maritime state with strategic interests in the Indian Ocean, UNCLOS provides the legal foundation for asserting resource rights, managing fisheries, and controlling pollution in its maritime zones.
- UNCLOS also supplies institutional pathways for dispute settlement and for claims over extended continental shelves — tools that are important for India’s management of maritime boundaries with neighbouring states and for securing seabed resources.
- The Convention’s partiality — resource and regulatory control without full sovereignty in the EEZ, and its silence on underlying land sovereignty — shapes strategic behaviour. Maritime security policy must therefore pair legal instruments with naval and diplomatic capabilities: law helps structure claims and offers forums for resolution, but enforcement, surveillance, and cooperative management are operational necessities.
- India’s ratification of UNCLOS and its engagement with ocean governance institutions demonstrate how legal order contributes to maritime strategy: the Convention underwrites India’s rights and responsibilities at sea, supports cooperative mechanisms for fisheries and environment protection, and provides dispute-resolution options that sit alongside diplomatic negotiation and, when necessary, power projection.
- Finally, the rise of ocean resource competition, concerns over pollution, and the increasing salience of the high seas (and the seabed beyond national jurisdiction) mean that UNCLOS remains central to India’s calculations of strategic interest and its contributions to regional maritime governance.

Conclusion
The shift from a seventeenth-century doctrine of open seas to a twentieth-century partitioning of maritime space reflects technological change, economic imperatives and environmental concerns. UNCLOS codified many of the customary practices that arose from unilateral state action and regional initiatives; it created an architecture that both empowers coastal states and preserves certain international freedoms. For India, this regime is not merely a matter of legal doctrine: it is a core component of maritime strategy, shaping how the state secures resources, protects the marine environment, settles disputes and projects influence across the Indian Ocean.

### The Territorial Sea in Transition: 1960 Claims, UNCLOS I, and Implications for Indian Strategic Culture

In 1960 the international community stood at a pivotal juncture in maritime law. A contemporaneous dataset of coastal-state claims shows marked divergence in the breadth of territorial waters, encapsulating a transitional moment between older customary practices and the movement toward a uniform treaty regime. The distribution of claims (1960) was as follows:

- 3 nautical miles: 26 states  
- 4 nautical miles: 3 states  
- 5 nautical miles: 1 state  
- 6 nautical miles: 16 states  
- 9 nautical miles: 1 state  
- 10 nautical miles: 2 states  
- 12 nautical miles: 34 states (single largest category)  
- More than 12 nautical miles: 9 states  
- Unspecified breadth: 11 states

(These figures reflect claims recorded at that time and total 103 entries; the “unspecified” category likely includes states in transition, with ambiguous policy, or without formal declaration.)

Historical and legal context
- The persistence of a 3-mile rule among many states traces to an archaic “cannon-shot” standard that linked coastal sovereignty to the effective range of shore‑based weaponry. Overlaid upon that historic rule was an accelerating claim by a plurality of states to 12 nautical miles, revealing an emerging norm even before it was codified.
- The diversity of claims—ranging from the vestiges of 3–6 nm limits to several states asserting more than 12 nm—reflected competing interests: coastal states’ desires for extended control over adjacent waters and resources on one side, and the maritime commercial and naval interest in freedom of navigation on the other.
- The unresolved nature of territorial breadth was a central legal and political issue addressed (but not settled) at the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS I), held in Geneva in 1958.

UNCLOS I: achievements and limits
- UNCLOS I produced four substantive conventions, each aimed at a different maritime regime. Their dates of entry into force (showing staggered ratification and operationalization) were:
  - Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone — entered into force 10 September 1964.
  - Convention on the Continental Shelf — entered into force 10 June 1964.
  - Convention on the High Seas — entered into force 30 September 1962.
  - Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living Resources of the High Seas — entered into force 20 March 1966.
- These instruments laid important foundations:
  - The Continental Shelf Convention began to articulate coastal states’ rights to seabed resources.
  - The High Seas and Fishing Conventions reaffirmed freedoms of navigation, fishing, and other high-seas uses.
- Crucially, however, UNCLOS I did not resolve the appropriate breadth of the territorial sea. That lacuna in the 1958 outcomes became a driving force for further negotiation at later conferences, especially UNCLOS III (1973–1982), which produced the comprehensive 1982 Convention.

Trajectories after 1960
- The plurality of 12 nautical mile claims in 1960 presaged the acceptance, at UNCLOS III, of a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea as the conventional international norm. UNCLOS III also established the 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a revolutionary regime for coastal control over living resources and certain seabed uses beyond the territorial sea.
- The “more than 12 miles” claims recorded in 1960 are significant: they indicate that some states were already testing or extending maritime claims prior to the later codification of limits, a dynamic that contributed to the eventual need for a comprehensive global settlement.
- The staggered entry into force of the 1958 conventions underscores that treaty adoption and implementation are processes that unfold over years and reflect states’ domestic and geopolitical calculations.

Implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s long coastline, island territories (especially the Andaman and Nicobar Islands), and its position astride critical sea lines of communication give maritime law central salience for Indian strategic thinking. The 1960 pattern of claims and the UNCLOS I outcomes had several concrete implications:
  - Resource access and economic security: the Continental Shelf Convention’s focus on seabed rights presaged the importance of legal claims for hydrocarbons and minerals—matters of energy security and economic development for India.
  - Sovereignty and maritime control: the absence of a settled territorial breadth in the 1950s–60s meant that India, like other coastal states, had to balance assertive coastal control (to secure fisheries, coastal zones, and islands) against the need to avoid excessive friction with states reliant on free navigation.
  - Naval strategy and freedom of navigation: doctrines preserving high-seas freedoms affected the Indian Navy’s operational concepts. A legal regime that protected unhindered passage through international waters while recognizing coastal rights helped shape India’s dual focus on protecting commerce and projecting maritime influence in the Indian Ocean.
  - Policy evolution: the unresolved questions after UNCLOS I—and the later codification under UNCLOS III—guided India’s diplomatic and legal posture. The global acceptance of 12 nm territorial seas and 200 nm EEZs provided clearer parameters for India to develop maritime legislation, resource management, and defence planning.
- For scholars of Indian strategic culture, the 1960 snapshot is revealing: it shows the international legal environment India had to navigate while forging its maritime policy, demonstrating how evolving international norms constrain and enable national choices about sea control, economic exploitation, and naval posture.

Key takeaways
- The 1960 dataset captures a transitional phase in maritime claims: while a plurality of states favored 12 nm, substantial variation remained across a spectrum of narrower and wider claims.
- UNCLOS I produced foundational treaties governing territorial zones, continental shelves, high seas, and fisheries, but left unresolved the crucial question of territorial sea breadth—necessitating later negotiation.
- The eventual standardization at UNCLOS III/1982 (12 nm territorial sea, 200 nm EEZ) owes much to the patterns and pressures evident in the period around 1960; these developments have had enduring consequences for India’s maritime strategy, resource policies, and national security planning.

This episode—where customary rules, historic practices (the “cannon-shot” origin), and contested state practice collided with emerging treaty law—helps explain why maritime law occupies a strategic core in India’s national-security calculus and why legal regimes, domestic policy, and naval strategy must be read together to understand India’s behaviour at sea.

### 3.x UNCLOS II (Geneva, 1960): A Cold War Diplomacy and Its Lessons for India

Overview
- In 1960 the United Nations convened its second Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS II) in Geneva. The meeting lasted roughly six weeks but produced no new treaty or binding agreements.
- The immediate outcome was therefore a diplomatic stalemate rather than legal settlement—reflecting both substantive disagreement over maritime regimes and the political dynamics of the period.

Political context and negotiation dynamics
- The conference took place at the height of Cold War bipolarity. Superpower competition between the United States and the Soviet Union framed alignments and bargaining positions throughout the talks.
- Developing countries—frequently described then as “third world” states—participated in the conference but with limited independent influence. Many attended as clients, allies, or dependents of one superpower or the other rather than as autonomous agenda-setters.
- Two effects followed: (a) Cold War geopolitics made neutral consensus difficult to achieve; (b) power asymmetries constrained the ability of developing states to press distinct maritime claims or to persuade the major powers to endorse them.

Substantive maritime issues at stake
- Although UNCLOS II yielded no treaty text, the debates foregrounded the core topics that would dominate later negotiations:
  - The breadth and legal regime of the territorial sea;
  - Rights over the continental shelf and seabed resources;
  - Freedom of navigation and corresponding coastal-state rights;
  - Regulation of marine resource exploitation and scientific research.
- The absence of agreement in 1960 signaled either deep substantive disagreement among states about these issues or a diplomatic deadlock largely attributable to superpower rivalry.

Significance and continuity: How UNCLOS II fitted into the longer process
- UNCLOS II was an early stage in a protracted multilateral process that culminated in UNCLOS III (1973–1982) and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.
- The Geneva outcome underscored a structural problem: when major powers dominate alignments, developing states struggle to secure rules that reflect their interests. This observation shaped later efforts to build broader, more inclusive coalitions and normative frameworks less susceptible to bipolar dominance.
- Geneva’s status as an established diplomatic venue made it a logical locus for these early law-of-the-sea conversations, but venue alone could not overcome the underlying political divides.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India attended multilateral maritime talks during the Cold War as a newly independent state that pursued non-alignment but still operated within bipolar pressures. In 1960, like many developing countries, India’s negotiating options were constrained by the larger international context.
- Lessons for India:
  - Institutional engagement matters: India’s later activism in UNCLOS III demonstrated the value of sustained, multilateral institution-building—where consistent mobilization of developing-country coalitions could translate diffuse interests into concrete norms (e.g., EEZs and continental shelf entitlements).
  - Strategic autonomy in diplomacy: The limitations experienced at UNCLOS II reinforced the national preference for maintaining diplomatic independence and cultivating diverse partnerships to avoid capture by a single great power’s agenda.
  - Maritime concepts as security instruments: The eventual legalization of extended continental shelves and exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in UNCLOS III had direct implications for India’s resource access, maritime jurisdiction, and naval strategy—areas now intrinsic to India’s national security doctrine.
  - Norm-building as balance-of-power tool: When great-power contestation stymies negotiations, normative multilateral frameworks can become instruments for medium and smaller powers (including India) to institutionalize rules that constrain the unilateral exercise of maritime power.

Concluding observations
- UNCLOS II’s failure was not merely a technical lapse in treaty-making; it was a political signal about the limits of multilateral law-making in a divided world. For India, the episode highlighted both constraints and opportunities: constraints from superpower politics in the short term, and an opportunity—realized in subsequent decades—to shape a rules-based maritime order through coalition politics and sustained diplomacy.
- The trajectory from UNCLOS II to UNCLOS III illustrates a core theme of Indian strategic culture: the pursuit of security and influence through patient institution-building, normative engagement, and careful balancing of great-power relations.

# United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III)
Section: UNCLOS III — Maritime Zones under International Law

This section presents a compact but comprehensive account of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) and the maritime regime it produced. It highlights the treaty’s historical genesis, principal legal rules on maritime zones, institutional architecture, and the practical and strategic consequences for states — with attention to the implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

## Historical context and the making of UNCLOS III
- 1967: Malta’s Ambassador Arvid Pardo drew attention at the UN to the proliferation of divergent territorial sea claims and to the absence of a universal law governing the ocean commons. His initiative catalysed the effort to create a single, comprehensive legal framework.
- 1973–1982: The Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea convened in New York to negotiate that framework. More than 160 states participated. The negotiators adopted a consensus procedure rather than majority voting in order to protect the interests of smaller and developing states and to secure as wide a legitimacy as possible.
- 1982: The conference concluded with the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
- Entry into force: UNCLOS became legally binding on 16 November 1994, one year after the required 60th ratification. The treaty thus moved from negotiated text to an operational international legal order governing maritime spaces.

UNCLOS III set out not only spatial limits and sovereign prerogatives but a comprehensive governance architecture for activities at sea — from navigation and resource exploitation to environmental protection and dispute settlement.

## Scope and objectives of the Convention
UNCLOS was designed to:
- Create a comprehensive, uniform legal framework for maritime zones and their uses;
- Reduce interstate conflict over maritime resources (fisheries, offshore hydrocarbons, and seabed minerals);
- Balance coastal-state entitlements with the international community’s freedoms (navigation, overflight, scientific research);
- Establish institutional mechanisms and dispute-resolution procedures for activities beyond national jurisdiction.

The Convention addresses baselines, internal waters, archipelagic and territorial seas, contiguous zones, Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs), continental shelves (including extended shelves), high seas, the “Area” (deep seabed beyond national jurisdiction), environmental protection, marine scientific research, and dispute settlement.

## Baselines and internal waters
- Baseline rule: Maritime zones are measured from a coastal state’s baselines, which normally follow the low-water line along the coast as marked on large-scale charts. Where coastlines are deeply indented, fringed with islands, or unstable, states may use straight baselines connecting appropriate points.
- Internal waters: Waters landward of the baseline are internal waters. Coastal states exercise full sovereignty in internal waters and may regulate or prohibit access; foreign vessels have no right of innocent passage in internal waters unless permitted by the coastal state.

Because baselines determine the breadth of all subsequent maritime entitlements, baseline determination is a critical technical and legal act with strategic consequences.

## Archipelagic States
- Part IV of UNCLOS recognizes “Archipelagic States.” An archipelagic state may draw archipelagic baselines connecting the outermost islands, converting the waters within into “archipelagic waters.”
- Archipelagic waters are under the sovereignty of the archipelagic state but are subject to certain pre-existing user rights (for example, traditional fishing rights) and to the requirement that foreign vessels enjoy the right of innocent passage.
- Archipelagic states may designate sea lanes and routes to reconcile sovereignty with the needs of international navigation and may regulate passage consistent with UNCLOS.

## Territorial sea and innocent passage
- Territorial sea: Coastal states exercise sovereignty up to 12 nautical miles (nmi) from the baseline.
- Innocent passage: Foreign vessels enjoy a right of innocent passage through the territorial sea so long as passage is continuous and expeditious and not prejudicial to the peace, good order, or security of the coastal state. Activities not considered innocent include fishing, polluting, weapons exercises, intelligence-gathering, and other acts that threaten security.
- Specific rule for submarines: Submarines and other underwater vehicles are required, during innocent passage, to navigate on the surface and show their flag.
- Suspension of innocent passage: A coastal state may temporarily suspend innocent passage in specified parts of its territorial sea if such suspension is essential for its security.

These rules reflect a calibrated compromise: sovereignty for coastal states, but limited by internationally guaranteed navigation freedoms.

## Transit passage and straits
- Transit passage: UNCLOS provides broader navigation rights through straits used for international navigation than does innocent passage. Transit passage cannot be impeded and permits continuous and expeditious transit by all ships and aircraft, including military vessels.
- The distinction between innocent passage and transit passage is strategically important for choke points and maritime commons through which global commerce and naval vessels move.

## Contiguous zone
- Contiguous zone: Extends beyond the territorial sea to a maximum of 24 nmi from the baseline (that is, 12 nmi of territorial sea plus an additional 12 nmi contiguous zone).
- Enforcement powers: Within the contiguous zone, a coastal state may take measures to prevent and punish infringements of its customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitary laws that originate within its territory or territorial sea or that are about to occur.

The contiguous zone is primarily a law-enforcement buffer that extends limited coastal prerogatives beyond the territorial sea.

## Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ)
- Extent and rights: The EEZ extends up to 200 nmi from the baseline. Within the EEZ, the coastal state has sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring, exploiting, conserving, and managing natural resources (living and non-living) of the waters, seabed, and subsoil, and jurisdiction with respect to the establishment and use of artificial islands, marine scientific research, and protection of the marine environment.
- Other states’ freedoms: Other states retain freedoms of navigation and overflight in the EEZ, as well as the right to lay submarine cables and pipelines. The EEZ does not confer full sovereignty akin to territorial sea.
- Purpose: The EEZ construct was introduced in part to reduce disputes over fisheries and to provide coastal states stable entitlements to offshore oil and gas as technological advances made exploitation commercially viable.

For many coastal states the EEZ has become the central maritime jurisdictional zone for economic security and resource management.

## Continental shelf (natural prolongation and outer limits)
- Definition: The continental shelf consists of the seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas that constitute the natural prolongation of the land territory to the outer edge of the continental margin, or to 200 nmi from the baseline where the outer edge does not extend that far.
- Extended limits: Coastal states may establish an extended continental shelf beyond 200 nmi, subject to scientific and technical limits. The outer limit may extend no more than 350 nmi from the baseline or 100 nmi beyond the 2,500-meter isobath (the 2,500 m depth-contour), whichever provides the greater extent within the limits prescribed.
- Rights: Coastal states possess exclusive sovereign rights over the continental shelf for the purpose of exploring and exploiting its natural resources — principally subsoil mineral and non-living resources and sedentary living organisms “attached” to the seabed. Rights over the water column above the shelf beyond the EEZ are not conferred to the coastal state.

Extended shelf claims must be supported by scientific submissions to, and recommendations from, the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS), making the process both technical and legal.

## The High Seas and the Area (deep seabed)
- High seas: Waters beyond national jurisdiction are open to all states and retain freedoms such as navigation, fishing (subject to conservation duties), and scientific research.
- The Area: The seabed and subsoil beyond national jurisdiction — “the Area” — are governed under an international regime. UNCLOS adopts the principle that the Area and its resources are the “common heritage of mankind.”
- International Seabed Authority (ISA): UNCLOS established the ISA to regulate exploration and exploitation of mineral resources in the Area and to administer benefit-sharing arrangements. The ISA issues licences and contracts, sets environmental standards, and supervises activities on the deep seabed.

This distinction between EEZs/continental shelves and the Area institutionalizes a dual regime: national rights where justified by proximity/natural prolongation, and international stewardship where no state has sovereign entitlement.

## Environmental protection and marine scientific research
UNCLOS imposes affirmative obligations on states to protect and preserve the marine environment, to cooperate on pollution prevention, and to promote responsible marine scientific research. Freedom of scientific research on the high seas is recognized but is subject to coastal-state jurisdiction where research is conducted in areas under national rights (e.g., EEZ, continental shelf).

## Dispute settlement and institutional architecture
- Institutions created or operationalized by UNCLOS:
  - International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) — based in Hamburg — as a principal judicial forum to hear disputes arising under the Convention.
  - Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) — a technical body advising on outer shelf limits.
  - International Seabed Authority (ISA) — to regulate activities in the Area.
- Dispute procedures: Parties to UNCLOS can submit maritime disputes to ITLOS, the International Court of Justice, or arbitral tribunals under Annex VII, among other options. The Convention provides binding dispute-resolution mechanisms, but parties may select different fora or agreements for specific disputes.

The availability of multiple compulsory and consensual mechanisms gives states a choice of legal pathways while providing predictable law for adjudication.

## Landlocked states
UNCLOS accords landlocked states the right of access to and from the sea and freedom of transit across transit states’ territory. Transit must be afforded without taxation of traffic, subject to the terms of transit agreements. This provision recognizes the security and economic importance of maritime access for states without a coastline.

## Key numbers and dates (summary)
- 1967: Arvid Pardo’s initiative at the UN.
- 1973–1982: UNCLOS III negotiations.
- 16 November 1994: UNCLOS entry into force (after 60 ratifications).
- 12 nmi: Maximum breadth of territorial sea from baseline.
- 24 nmi: Outer limit of contiguous zone (12 nmi territorial + 12 nmi contiguous).
- 200 nmi: EEZ limit from baseline (and the default reference for continental shelf if natural prolongation is shorter).
- 350 nmi / 100 nmi beyond 2,500 m isobath: Absolute outer limit(s) for an extended continental shelf.

## Legal implications and state practice
- Sovereign rights vs. freedoms: Coastal states secure exclusive rights to resources within EEZs and continental shelves, while other states retain internationally protected freedoms (navigation, overflight, laying of cables).
- Baselines and delimitation: Baseline determinations and maritime boundary delimitations are technical, legal, and often politically sensitive matters; disputes over baselines or overlapping entitlements are frequent and may require negotiation, arbitration, or adjudication.
- Extended shelf claims: Scientific, technical and legal submissions to CLCS are prerequisites for establishing outer continental shelf limits beyond 200 nmi.
- Deep seabed governance: The common heritage principle places mineral resources of the Area under international management rather than unilateral control.
- Enforcement and security: States balance law-enforcement prerogatives in zones such as the contiguous zone and EEZ with navigation freedoms, with occasional tension between coastal-state security measures and the rights of other states.

## Practical implications for states
- Administrative tasks: Coastal states must survey their maritime zones, demarcate baselines, register claims, and where appropriate make CLCS submissions.
- Resource governance: EEZs and continental shelf rights make fisheries and hydrocarbon policy central to national economic security.
- Maritime security and SLOCs: Navies and coast guards must plan for the protection of sea lines of communication, counter-piracy, and law enforcement while respecting UNCLOS freedoms of navigation.
- Boundary delimitation: Bilateral or multilateral negotiations, mediation, or recourse to judicial fora often resolve overlapping claims.
- Transit arrangements: Landlocked states and transit states need practical agreements to implement UNCLOS’s transit and access guarantees.

## Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
UNCLOS shapes India’s maritime strategy in several specific ways:
- Legal foundation for maritime claims: UNCLOS provides the legal basis for India’s 200 nmi EEZ and continental shelf rights, underpinning national claims over fisheries, hydrocarbons, and seabed resources.
- Baselines and islands: India’s baseline declarations and treatment of island territories (Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep) are instrumental to India’s maritime outreach and to the defence of its eastern and western seaboards.
- Continental shelf submissions and resource security: The scientific and legal processes required for extended continental-shelf claims oblige India to invest in oceanographic capacity and shape its interests in seabed minerals and hydrocarbon exploration.
- Balancing sovereignty and navigation freedoms: India’s strategic calculus must reconcile coastal-state prerogatives (e.g., control over activities in the EEZ) with India’s interest in preserving freedom of navigation — a doctrinally significant posture for a rising maritime power safeguarding sea lines of communication in the Indian Ocean.
- Institutions and dispute settlement: India’s engagement with ITLOS, CLCS and the ISA reflects a preference for multilateral legal order and technical procedures to legitimise its maritime entitlements, while retaining diplomatic and military options to protect national security.
- Regional cooperation and conflict mitigation: UNCLOS encourages India to pursue bilateral and regional mechanisms for fisheries management, delimitation, and maritime security cooperation (e.g., combating piracy, search and rescue, and environmental protection).
- Strategic signalling: By invoking UNCLOS norms, India can both assert legal claims and signal its adherence to a rules-based maritime order — a useful component of its strategic culture that combines legalism, diplomacy, and selective power projection.

## Concluding observations
UNCLOS III produced a durable, multilayered legal architecture that balances coastal-state entitlements and global commons freedoms. For states such as India the Convention is not only a legal instrument but a strategic framework: it governs the allocation of economic rights, structures maritime security responsibilities, sets the terms of technical and judicial adjudication, and anchors India’s engagement with regional and global maritime governance institutions. Effective national policy therefore requires integration of legal competence, oceanographic science, naval and coast-guard capability, and diplomatic engagement — all of which are central elements of India’s evolving strategic culture.

# Admiralty and maritime law — overview and UNCLOS Part XI with the 1994 Implementation Agreement

This section situates admiralty and maritime law in its historical and institutional context, then focuses on the legal and political architecture governing the deep seabed — UNCLOS Part XI, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) and the 1994 Implementation Agreement — with attention to implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

## I. Historical foundations of maritime law
Maritime law is an ancient, transregional legal domain shaped by commercial practice, customary norms and successive codifications. Key antecedents include:

- Code of Hammurabi: among the earliest legal texts to regulate maritime risk and commerce, showing the antiquity of shipping-related liability concepts.
- Corpus Juris Civilis (including the Digesta): Roman juristic writings that transmitted principles (contract, agency, ownership, salvage) that later informed European maritime practice.
- Ordinamenta et consuetudo maris and Amalfian Laws: medieval Mediterranean ordinances and the Amalfi maritime code that systematized rules on carriage, salvage and ports.
- Hanseatic League practices: northern European merchant customs that standardized contractual and procedural maritime commerce.
  
These sources produced durable patterns — prioritizing commercial certainty, allocating risk (seaworthiness, general average, total loss), and institutionalizing specialized courts — that persist in modern admiralty law.

## II. Core substantive features of admiralty and maritime law
Admiralty law governs a wide set of subject-matters that combine commercial, environmental and security concerns:

- Commercial and shipping law: carriage of goods and passengers, bills of lading, charterparties (voyage vs. time), affreightment, demurrage, laytime, cargo claims, carrier liability regimes and contract documentation (invoice, manifest, packing list, waybill).
- Ship finance and corporate instruments: ship mortgages, vessel registration, marine insurance, and the commercial regulation of shipbuilding and merchant fleets.
- Risk and liability concepts: force majeure, acts of God, collision law, general average, seaworthiness obligations, total and constructive total loss, salvage and towage, liens, proof of delivery and remedies.
- Fisheries and resource law: regulation of fishing within EEZs, straddling stocks and high seas fisheries governance.
- Maritime security and wartime law: piracy, letters of marque (historical), prizes, naval blockade and rules of engagement in wartime.
- Illicit activities and law enforcement: counter-narcotics, smuggling, human trafficking, and jurisdictional enforcement on the high seas.
- Crew and port operations: seafarer status, mutiny, employment standards, and the role of stevedores and port operators.
- Specialized adjudication: admiralty/vice-admiralty courts, national maritime tribunals and international forums for dispute settlement.

## III. Principal actors and institutional frameworks
Parties and institutions that populate maritime law:

- Operational actors: master (captain), owner, carrier, charterer, consignor/consignee, agents, freight forwarders, stevedores and seafarers.
- Financial and commercial actors: insurers, mortgagees, classification societies (IACS members, Lloyd’s Register), and shipyards.
- Courts and tribunals: national admiralty courts, specialized maritime arbitration, and international dispute bodies (ITLOS, ICJ where applicable).
- International organizations and rule-makers: International Maritime Organization (IMO), Comité Maritime International (CMI), London Maritime Arbitrators’ Association (LMAA), classification societies and the International Seabed Authority (ISA) for the Area.
- Multilateral treaty regimes and technical codes (below).

## IV. Key multilateral conventions and technical codes
A compact (but foundational) list of instruments shaping modern maritime governance:

- Safety, liability, pollution and labour conventions: SOLAS, MARPOL, the Salvage Convention, Hague-Visby / Hamburg / Rotterdam Rules (contractual carriage), the Athens Convention (passengers), and the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC).
- Environmental protection: Ballast Water Management Convention, London Protocol on dumping, and regional/national environmental laws that interlock with UNCLOS.
- Deep-sea regime: UNCLOS (umbrella framework) and ISA regulations for exploration and exploitation of the Area.
- Technical/operational codes: IMDG Code (dangerous goods), ISM (safety management), ISPS (port/ship security), Polar Code, IGC/IBC (gas and bulk chemical cargoes), Grain & IMSBC Codes, INF Code.
  
These instruments allocate responsibilities, technical standards and enforcement modalities; they create the legal scaffolding for maritime commerce and environmental protection.

## V. From general maritime law to deep-seabed governance: UNCLOS Part XI
UNCLOS (opened for signature 1982; entered into force 1994) is the comprehensive treaty that codifies maritime zones and regime responsibilities. Part XI addresses mineral resources of the seabed beyond national jurisdiction — “the Area” — and establishes a distinctive governance model:

- Common heritage of mankind: Part XI declares that the Area and its resources are the common heritage of mankind, requiring collective management, equitable benefit-sharing and restraint on unilateral appropriation.
- International Seabed Authority (ISA): created to administer seabed activities in the Area — authorizing exploration and exploitation, issuing contracts, prescribing environmental standards, setting payment/royalty regimes and distributing benefits.
- Licensing and regulation: the ISA has exclusive competence to grant contracts for activities in the Area, to adopt mining regulations and to monitor compliance.
- State sponsorship: coastal or sponsoring states bear international responsibility for private entities they sponsor, and must ensure compliance with UNCLOS/ISA rules.

## VI. The political controversy: US objections and provisional practice
While many States embraced UNCLOS, the Part XI regime drew strong objections from industrialized market-economy states, most notably the United States:

- US concerns: Part XI’s mandatory technology-transfer provisions, production controls, financing and decision-making rules were seen as economically and strategically disadvantageous to private industry and to US national interests; consequently the US did not ratify UNCLOS.
- Interim practices (1980s–1990s): several industrialized states and commercial actors pursued alternative arrangements — e.g., bilateral licenses or consortia-based exploration — and a Preparatory Commission was established to operationalize the ISA and reconcile overlapping claims.
- Political momentum for reform: declining immediate commercial urgency for seabed mining and sustained diplomatic pressure produced multilateral negotiations aimed at making Part XI acceptable to developed states.

## VII. The 1994 Agreement on Implementation of Part XI — core modifications
The 1994 Agreement (a binding adjustment to Part XI) recalibrated the seabed regime to attract accession by developed, market-economy states. Principal elements:

- Market-oriented reforms: removal or non-application of certain mandatory production controls and the most intrusive technology-transfer requirements, thereby protecting private commercial interests.
- Decision-making and representation: creation of group-based Council membership and voting arrangements that afforded developed-state interests effective participation; the Agreement provided guarantees of representation (notably language that ensured major contributors would have a stable presence on the ISA Council).
- Finance Committee and donors’ safeguards: establishment of a Finance Committee in which major financial contributors to ISA programs receive procedural protections (e.g., automatic membership and consensus decision-making for finance matters).
- Practical effect: the Agreement preserved the ISA and the common-heritage principle but modified governance to balance developing states’ equitable claims with assurances to industrialized states and industry.

These changes materially lowered political barriers to accession by developed States; UNCLOS entry into force in 1994 followed and the ISA began substantive work with the 1994 Agreement operationalizing Part XI.

## VIII. ITLOS advisory guidance and evolving legal obligations (2011 opinion)
The Seabed Disputes Chamber of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) issued an advisory opinion in 2011 at the ISA’s request, clarifying legal responsibilities under UNCLOS/Part XI and the 1994 Agreement:

- Context: advisory requests concerned sponsorship mechanisms and environmental obligations in light of planned polymetallic nodule activities (notably involving sponsored entities).
- Key clarifications: states sponsoring contractors have international obligations to ensure compliance; the ISA must apply precautionary and environmental safeguards; and the regime integrates UNCLOS obligations, ISA regulations and general environmental law (including the Rio Declaration’s precautionary approach — Principle 15) into assessment and monitoring duties.
- Importance: while advisory opinions are not directly binding on States, the ITLOS guidance carries strong persuasive authority and informs ISA regulation, state practice, and dispute settlement expectations.

## IX. Implications — governance, geopolitics, environment and commerce (with an India perspective)
The Part XI/1994 architecture and subsequent jurisprudence have several enduring implications relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security:

- Governance and strategic stake: the ISA is central to any future deep-seabed mining regime. For a maritime power like India — with a growing blue economy, scientific capacity and strategic interests in the Indian Ocean — active engagement with ISA governance strengthens influence over rule-making and benefit-sharing.
- Accession and diplomacy: the 1994 Agreement made UNCLOS more palatable to developed States, reshaping coalition dynamics within the ISA. India’s participation in UNCLOS and ISA (India is a party to UNCLOS and an active maritime actor) enables it to balance developing-state perspectives with engagement from major maritime powers.
- Environmental risk and precaution: ITLOS’s emphasis on environmental protection and state responsibilities elevates the precautionary principle as a legal and policy constraint. India’s security policy and strategic culture — which increasingly embraces ecological resilience and sustainable exploitation of marine resources — must incorporate robust precautionary standards and monitoring for any deep-seabed activities.
- State sponsorship and regulatory responsibility: the doctrine of sponsorship makes States internationally responsible for private contractors. For India, this imposes domestic regulatory duties (licensing, oversight, environmental assessment) if it sponsors scientific or commercial exploration, and it heightens legal exposure if due diligence is insufficient.
- Geopolitical competition: voting structures, donor protections and Council groupings reflect negotiated compromises between developing States’ equity claims and major donors’ protections. In a region where China’s maritime reach is growing, India’s strategic posture requires both normative leadership (defending equitable access) and practical coalition-building within ISA and related fora.
- Commercial and technological drivers: the economic viability of deep-seabed mining depends on commodity markets, cost structures, and technology. Renewed commercial interest could alter strategic incentives; India’s policy calculus must therefore be adaptive, balancing potential resource security benefits against environmental and diplomatic costs.
- Legal precedent and normative influence: ITLOS advisory opinions and ISA regulations set strong precedents. India’s contribution to treaty implementation, scientific research and procedural practice will shape evolving norms concerning marine environmental protection and benefit-sharing.

## X. Additional points of relevance
- UNCLOS timing: opened for signature in 1982 and entered into force in 1994; the 1994 Agreement operationalized contested aspects of Part XI.
- Resource targets: polymetallic nodules, seamount minerals and hydrothermal vent deposits are primary deep-sea mineral targets; their ecological sensitivity underscores the environmental stakes.
- Common heritage debates: the “common heritage of mankind” principle remains politically contested — a locus of North–South contestation over control, technology transfer and equitable benefit-sharing.
- Contemporary policy debates: NGOs, scientific bodies and many States have urged moratoria or stringent safeguards on seabed exploitation until robust environmental baselines and governance safeguards exist.
- Strategic lesson for India: maritime law is not merely technical; it is a strategic field in which legal regimes, institutional membership, scientific capacity and policy choices intersect to shape national security, economic opportunity and normative leadership.

Conclusion
Admiralty and maritime law provide the legal scaffolding for commerce, security and environmental protection at sea. UNCLOS Part XI and the 1994 Implementation Agreement exemplify how legal design mediates competing strategic interests — development vs. market access, collective heritage vs. private rights — and how subsequent adjudication (ITLOS) integrates environmental obligations into a regime once primarily conceived as resource governance. For India, these developments are consequential: legal engagement, institutional leadership and prudent regulatory practice in the maritime domain are components of a strategic culture that seeks maritime security, sustainable economic use of the oceans and authoritative voice in shaping global maritime norms.

## Part XII of UNCLOS: Marine Environmental Protection — Rules, Institutions and Enforcement (and relevance for India)

Part XII of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) constitutes the treaty’s central environmental pillar. It creates affirmative, duty‑based obligations on all states to protect and preserve the marine environment and supplies the legal architecture within which maritime environmental regulation is operationalised. For a maritime power such as India, Part XII is both a normative framework and a practical constraint shaping national law, operational capacity and cooperative practice in the Indian Ocean.

Key elements of Part XII
- General obligations: Articles 192–196 establish the foundational duties. States must protect and preserve the marine environment (art. 192) and take all measures necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution from any source (art. 194). These obligations are universal, applying to actions within states’ jurisdictions and to activities that affect areas beyond national control.
- Duty to cooperate: Part XII expressly requires states to cooperate on a global and regional basis in formulating rules, standards and recommended practices, and in applying them through competent international organisations (art. 197).

Flag states, IMO instruments and MARPOL
- Flag‑state primacy: UNCLOS places primary responsibility for regulating and enforcing ship conduct on the state whose flag the ship flies. Flag states are expected to ensure that vessels under their registry comply with applicable international rules and standards.
- Specific flag‑state duties include: issuance and control of statutory certificates; inspection and survey regimes; investigation of incidents and alleged violations; and the capacity to impose administrative, civil or criminal sanctions when required.
- Role of the IMO: The International Maritime Organization is the principal specialised body through which technical and operational maritime environmental standards are developed. States routinely implement IMO instruments domestically to satisfy their UNCLOS obligations.
- MARPOL as the central example: The International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL 73/78) addresses major ship‑source pollution categories — oil, noxious liquid substances, sewage, garbage and air emissions — and illustrates how IMO norms operationalise UNCLOS duties. MARPOL provisions are typically transposed into national law and enforced by flag, coastal and port states.

Coastal and port state jurisdiction and enforcement
- Coastal state powers: Coastal states enjoy their strongest regulatory reach in internal waters, the territorial sea and their Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Within these zones they may regulate and control pollution from both land‑ and sea‑based sources and can adopt measures necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution consistent with UNCLOS.
- Port state control: Port states have broadened enforcement powers when foreign ships call at their ports. Port State Control (PSC) regimes enable inspection of foreign ships, detention of vessels failing to meet international standards, and denial of port access. National PSC regimes are an important tool to address lax flag administration and to enforce IMO instruments where flag states fail to act.
- Reach to activities affecting the high seas: While flag state jurisdiction remains primary on the high seas, Part XII contemplates cooperative and supplementary enforcement mechanisms. Coastal and port states may take action in respect of pollution affecting their maritime zones; furthermore, certain treaties and cooperative agreements allow expanded scrutiny of high seas activities consistent with UNCLOS and other instruments.

Enforcement realities, gaps and cooperative mechanisms
- Practical enforcement tools: States may employ administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, vessel detention, denial of port services and diplomatic or judicial dispute settlement mechanisms (including arbitration) to enforce obligations.
- Sources of friction: Tensions commonly arise where flag‑state laxity undermines coastal or port states’ environmental protection interests. Disparities in regulatory rigor, surveillance capacity and willingness to prosecute can produce enforcement gaps exploited by offending operators.
- Cooperative remedies: Effective marine environmental protection depends on information‑sharing, regional cooperation, mutual assistance, harmonisation of national laws and joint enforcement initiatives — for example regional PSC Memoranda of Understanding, joint patrols and shared incident response arrangements.

Capacity, implementation and the need for harmonisation
- Domestic implementation: To avoid legal and enforcement gaps, states must transpose UNCLOS and IMO standards into domestic legislation and ensure institutional capacity for certification, inspection, monitoring and prosecution.
- Capacity‑building needs: Many states, particularly small or developing coastal states, require technical assistance, training and resources to fulfil UNCLOS/IMO obligations. International cooperation and assistance are therefore central to effective global marine environmental governance.
- Policy implication: Harmonisation — both of substantive rules and of enforcement practice — reduces incentives for regulatory evasion and strengthens collective protection of shared seas.

Legal and practical implications for India’s strategic policy
- Strategic stakes: India’s status as a large coastal and maritime state with extensive seaborne trade, a long coastline and strategic interests across the Indian Ocean makes effective implementation of Part XII central to national security, economic resilience and environmental stewardship.
- Policy priorities for India:
  - Robust domestic incorporation of UNCLOS and IMO instruments (notably MARPOL) into national law, with clear enforcement powers and penalties.
  - Strengthening flag‑state oversight for Indian‑flagged vessels and enhancing port‑state control at Indian ports to detect and deter non‑compliance.
  - Regional leadership in capacity building — assisting littoral states in the Indian Ocean with PSC capability, surveillance and incident response — to reduce pollution risks and advance cooperative security.
  - Investment in maritime domain awareness (surveillance, monitoring, pollution‑detection technologies) and incident response (salvage, Forensics, judicial processes) to convert legal obligations into operational effect.
  - Use of diplomatic and technical channels through the IMO and regional fora to promote higher environmental standards and to address flag‑state laxity through coordinated PSC action.
- Security framing: Pollution and marine environmental degradation are not only ecological problems but also strategic vulnerabilities. Disruption to sea lines of communication, harm to fisheries and coastal infrastructure, and cross‑border maritime incidents can have cascading security consequences. Treating UNCLOS Part XII implementation as integral to India’s national security policy aligns legal compliance with strategic resilience.

Conclusion
Part XII of UNCLOS provides a legal and cooperative framework that links international rule‑making (chiefly via the IMO), state duties (especially flag, coastal and port states), and enforcement mechanisms. For India, the central task is to translate those international duties into robust national law, institutional capacity and regional leadership — thereby protecting the marine environment while safeguarding strategic and economic interests across the Indian Ocean.

## High Seas Treaty (BBNJ Agreement)

The Agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction — commonly referred to in diplomatic and policy circles as the BBNJ Agreement — represents the first comprehensive, legally binding instrument specifically tailored to the biological diversity of the high seas. Popular shorthand labels such as the “High Seas Treaty” or the “Global Ocean Treaty” have entered public discourse; those names, however, are not neutral and have been contested by some stakeholders who emphasise the instrument’s formal legal pedigree as an agreement negotiated under UNCLOS.

Legal form and provenance
- Legal nature: a legally binding agreement negotiated and concluded as an implementing agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
- Origin: mandated by the UN General Assembly in 2017 through a resolution directing an intergovernmental conference to consider an international legally binding instrument (ILBI) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction (commonly abbreviated BBNJ).
- Adoption and finalisation: the text was finalised during an intergovernmental conference on 4 March 2023 and formally adopted on 19 June 2023 by the UN membership. The instrument was adopted by the 193 United Nations Member States.
- Parties eligible to join: both sovereign states and regional economic integration organisations may become parties to the Agreement.

Purpose, structure and stated aims
- Stated aim (excerpt): the Agreement frames the international community as stewards of the ocean beyond national jurisdiction, directing measures to protect the integrity of the marine environment and conserve biological diversity for present and future generations.
- Structure: the instrument comprises 76 articles and two annexes, elaborating substantive obligations, institutional arrangements and procedures for implementation.
- Recognition and normative principles: the Agreement explicitly recognises the value of traditional knowledge and includes normative principles such as the polluter-pays principle; it addresses in its operative provisions the differentiated and cumulative impacts of human activities beyond national jurisdiction.

The four thematic packages
The Agreement organises its substantive content around four mutually reinforcing thematic “packages” that combine technical conservation measures with questions of equity and capacity:

1. Marine genetic resources (MGRs), including digital sequence information (DSI), and benefit-sharing
   - Scope: covers access to MGRs in areas beyond national jurisdiction and mechanisms for the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from their utilisation.
   - Political and operational sensitivity: the inclusion of DSI raised—and continues to raise—complex technical and political issues. Operationalising access and benefit‑sharing arrangements for intangible genetic information remains one of the most contentious and technically challenging elements of implementation.

2. Area-based management tools (ABMTs), including marine protected areas (MPAs)
   - Function: provides the legal and procedural mechanisms by which parties can propose, negotiate and adopt ABMTs/MPAs in international waters.
   - Practical achievement: the Agreement enables the creation of MPAs in areas beyond national jurisdiction, a central advance that civil society hailed as a major conservation milestone. The mechanism also offers a pathway toward internationally endorsed conservation targets, including contributing to the “30 by 30” objective of protecting 30% of the ocean by 2030.

3. Environmental impact assessments (EIAs)
   - Purpose: establishes obligations and procedures requiring assessment of potential significant impacts from planned activities in areas beyond national jurisdiction, strengthening preventive conservation measures.

4. Capacity building and the transfer of marine technology (CB&TMT)
   - Equity dimension: provisions for capacity building and technology transfer are designed to enable equitable participation by developing states in research, MPA governance and benefit‑sharing arrangements. The CB&TMT package is essential to addressing substantive inequalities in scientific and managerial capability.

Functional distinctions and cross-cutting linkages
- Conservation vs. equity: ABMTs and EIAs are principally conservation and sustainable-use instruments; by contrast, MGRs/DSI and CB&TMT address both conservation and distributive justice questions — who benefits and who participates.
- Climate linkage: although the Agreement does not directly regulate climate change, it has a relevant ancillary role. Protection of ecosystems in high-seas areas can contribute to carbon sequestration and the preservation of carbon-rich sediments; in this respect the instrument supports, indirectly, climate mitigation and resilience objectives.

Reception and political context
- Civil society reaction: environmental NGOs celebrated the outcome; Greenpeace described the Agreement as “the biggest conservation victory ever.”
- Financial and implementation support: regional and supranational actors such as the European Union have pledged financial assistance for ratification and implementation efforts.
- Adoption status vs. entry into force: while adoption was universal in the UN General Assembly context (193 Member States), the Agreement’s legal entry into force depends on ratification by at least 60 States — a threshold that is expected to take years to meet, reflecting the protracted timelines typical of major multilateral treaties (UNCLOS itself was adopted in 1982 and entered into force only in 1994).

Implementation challenges and institutional interactions
- Implementation challenges to watch:
  - Negotiating and designating specific ABMTs/MPAs in the high seas — decisions that require political compromise and technical justification;
  - Monitoring, surveillance and enforcement at ocean basin scale — a persistent practical obstacle given limits of capacity and jurisdictional reach;
  - Harmonising new obligations with existing regional instruments and institutions, notably regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) and the International Seabed Authority (ISA), to avoid duplication and regulatory conflict.
- MGRs and DSI: operationalising fair and equitable benefit-sharing for both physical samples and digital sequence data continues to be politically fraught and technically complex.
- Capacity building: the CB&TMT provisions will be decisive in enabling equitable scientific participation and ensuring that developing states can make use of, and benefit from, the Agreement’s tools.

Strategic implications and the role of major maritime states
- Strategic implication: the pattern and timing of ratifications by major maritime powers and flag states will have an outsized influence on the Agreement’s practical effectiveness, compliance dynamics and the political habitus that forms around its institutions.
- Coordination and influence: states with significant research, naval and commercial maritime capability will shape how ABMTs are proposed, monitored and enforced, and will be central to constructing the interoperable surveillance and data systems required for compliance.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s stake: as a rising maritime power with extensive oceanographic research capacity, a significant blue‑economy agenda, and strategic interests across the Indian Ocean and beyond, India has a direct stake in how governance of the high seas evolves.
- Opportunities:
  - Scientific and economic: clearer rules on access and benefit-sharing for MGRs could open avenues for Indian research institutions and bio-enterprises, provided the DSI regime is operationalised in ways that recognise non-commercial scientific access and enable equitable collaboration;
  - Conservation leadership: participation in ABMT/MPA processes offers India an opportunity to project norms of responsible stewardship and to align its regional ocean diplomacy with global conservation targets such as “30 by 30”;
  - Capacity development: CB&TMT provisions provide a multilateral framework through which India can both receive targeted support where needed and, reciprocally, export capacity-building expertise to island and low-capacity states in the Indian Ocean region.
- Strategic cautions:
  - Security and operational considerations: the implementation of ABMTs and high-seas MPAs intersects with freedom of navigation and maritime security operations; India will need to reconcile conservation commitments with operational requirements for naval deployment, maritime surveillance and law enforcement;
  - Ratification politics: India’s decision to ratify (and the timing thereof) will be consequential — both in terms of signalling India’s commitment to global ocean governance and for shaping the normative environment in which India’s maritime activities occur.
- Policy recommendation (concise): India should pursue an integrated approach that aligns treaty ratification with investments in ocean science, capacity-building partnerships for regional states, and the development of legal and operational procedures to harmonise conservation measures with legitimate maritime security and commercial activities.

Conclusion
The BBNJ Agreement constitutes a landmark normative and institutional development in the law of the sea — a specifically tailored, legally binding instrument addressing long‑standing gaps in governance of the biological resources of the high seas. Its practical impact will be determined not only by the text but by the political dynamics of ratification, the technical work of operationalising contentious elements (notably MGRs/DSI), and the capacity of states and regional bodies to implement, monitor and enforce its measures. For India, the Agreement presents both opportunities for leadership in conservation and science diplomacy, and strategic trade‑offs that must be managed within the broader arc of the country’s maritime and national security policies.

# Parties

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is now the foundational multilateral treaty governing maritime rights and responsibilities. Understanding who is a “party” to UNCLOS — and the forms that participation can take — is essential both legally and strategically, since the Convention furnishes the primary rules that shape maritime jurisdiction, resource rights, navigation, and dispute settlement.

What is a “party”?
- A “party” to a treaty is a state or international organization that has expressed its consent to be legally bound, normally through ratification or accession. For UNCLOS, parties accept the Convention’s comprehensive regime for territorial seas, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), continental shelves, high seas freedoms, and the law of the continental shelf and seabed.
- A signature is a preliminary endorsement of a treaty text; it does not itself create binding treaty obligations. An instrument of ratification (or accession) is the formal document that a state deposits to confirm consent to be bound. UNCLOS required deposit of a set number of such instruments to trigger entry into force.

History and entry into force
- UNCLOS was opened for signature on 10 December 1982. It entered into force on 16 November 1994, upon the deposit of the 60th instrument of ratification or accession. This threshold mechanism is typical for multilateral treaties: a critical mass of consent was required before the Convention became legally operative.

Current status and composition of parties
- As of the most recent consolidated count, UNCLOS has overwhelmingly wide participation: 170 parties in total. That figure comprises:
  - 166 United Nations member states;
  - 1 UN Observer state (Palestine);
  - Two non‑UN-member entities with recognized treaty‑making capacity (the Cook Islands and Niue); and
  - The European Union, which is itself a party.
- The inclusion of the Cook Islands and Niue demonstrates that UNCLOS admits non‑UN members provided they possess international legal personality sufficient to conclude treaties.
- The European Union’s status illustrates another feature of modern treaty practice: regional organizations with competence over certain policy areas may become parties alongside their member states when they have been conferred specific external competence.

Dual representation: the European Union and its implications
- The phrase “dually represented by the European Union” reflects a legal and practical reality: the EU is a regional organization with external competence in many aspects of the law of the sea (for example, fisheries and certain environmental measures). As a result, the EU has acceded to UNCLOS in its own right even while its member states remain parties individually.
- Dual representation has practical consequences for treaty implementation, institutional engagement, and dispute settlement. It requires coordination between the EU and member states on the exercise of shared competences and can complicate questions of standing, jurisdiction and treaty interpretation in specific disputes.

Signatories
- “Signatories” appears as a separate heading in many treaty lists because signature is a distinct procedural step from ratification. A state that has signed but not ratified UNCLOS signals political support for the text but is not yet fully bound by its obligations.
- A notable case is the United States: the U.S. signed UNCLOS but has not completed ratification, meaning it is not a party even though it accepts many of the Convention’s rules as customary international law and conducts freedom‑of‑navigation operations pursuant to those principles.

Non‑parties
- Non‑parties fall into two categories: states that have signed but not ratified/accessioned, and states that have neither signed nor ratified. The practical effect varies: non‑parties are not formally bound by treaty obligations, though parts of UNCLOS may reflect customary international law binding on all states.
- The absence of certain major powers from the list of parties (or their failure to ratify) has strategic implications for enforcement, normative authority and the politics of maritime governance.

Legal and strategic significance for India
- India is a party to UNCLOS and therefore operates within the Convention’s legal architecture for asserting maritime jurisdiction and rights. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, UNCLOS matters in several concrete ways:
  - Jurisdictional clarity: UNCLOS supplies the legal categories India uses to claim and manage maritime zones — territorial sea, contiguous zone, EEZ and continental shelf — which are central to coastal defence, resource security and maritime law enforcement.
  - Resource rights and continental shelf claims: the Convention’s regimes for living and non‑living resources (fisheries, seabed minerals) and for the definition and extension of the continental shelf have direct bearing on India’s economic and strategic interests in the Indian Ocean.
  - Navigation and freedoms: UNCLOS codifies passage and high‑seas freedoms that India invokes in supporting a rules‑based regional order and in conducting naval operations, including freedom of navigation and overflight.
  - Dispute settlement and evidence: the Convention offers compulsory dispute‑settlement mechanisms and technical processes (e.g., submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf) that require sophisticated legal and scientific capacity — capabilities that India has invested in as part of its maritime strategy.
  - Diplomatic leverage and norms: India's commitment to UNCLOS underpins its advocacy for a rules‑based order in the Indian Ocean region and informs bilateral and multilateral engagement on maritime boundary delimitation, marine environmental protection and seabed governance.
- The strategic utility of UNCLOS is also conditioned by geopolitical realities: when major maritime powers remain non‑parties or interpret rules differently, the effectiveness of the Convention as a guarantor of maritime order depends on diplomatic and operational balancing—areas where India’s naval diplomacy and legal diplomacy are relevant.

Concluding practical note
- UNCLOS became operative through the deposit of instruments of ratification and accession — a procedural detail with substantive consequences. Ratification remains the legal act that converts signature into binding commitment, and wide ratification has given UNCLOS its character as the central legal framework of the oceans. For India, participation in that framework is both a legal basis for maritime claims and an instrument of strategic policy in the contest for influence and security in the Indian Ocean and beyond.

## UNCLOS: Systematising the Law of the Sea and Its Strategic Consequences

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is the principal juridical architecture that systematises and codifies contemporary maritime law. Adopted in 1982 and entered into force in 1994, the Convention consolidated centuries of seaborne practice and earlier treaty law into a single, comprehensive regime governing the uses, resources and freedoms of the oceans. For states like India — whose security and economic interests are increasingly maritime — UNCLOS is both a legal framework and a strategic fact of life.

Key functions and legal innovations
- Codification and consolidation: UNCLOS took established customary rules and fragmented multilateral instruments and unified them in a single text. It integrated and updated earlier instruments — notably the four 1958 Geneva Conventions on the law of the sea (territorial sea and contiguous zone; continental shelf; high seas; fishing and conservation of living resources) — consolidating many prior requirements while strengthening and expanding others.
- Definition of maritime zones: The Convention provides clear legal definitions and legal regimes for the principal maritime zones: territorial sea, contiguous zone, exclusive economic zone (EEZ), continental shelf, and the high seas. These delineations underpin coastal-state jurisdiction and the spatial allocation of sovereign rights and freedoms.
- Rights and duties: UNCLOS delineates the balance between coastal-state rights (notably sovereign rights for the exploration and exploitation of living and non‑living resources in the EEZ and continental shelf) and the traditional freedoms of navigation, overflight and the laying of submarine cables enjoyed by other states. It also imposes affirmative duties — for example, obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment and to cooperate in the conservation of living resources.
- Dispute-settlement and institutional mechanisms: The Convention creates compulsory, rule‑based options for resolving maritime disputes, including the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), arbitral procedures (Annex VII), and the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) for submissions on extended continental shelf claims. These mechanisms give legal effect and practicable means to settle boundary, delimitation, and resource disputes.

Foundations and principles
UNCLOS did not invent maritime law; it synthesised practice and doctrine refined over centuries. It also embodies central principles comparable to those in the UN Charter — such as peaceful settlement of disputes and sovereign equality — by furnishing procedural avenues and legal standards for resolving maritime questions. At the same time, it strengthened the rule-based character of maritime governance, replacing ad hoc arrangements with normative clarity and institutionalised procedures.

Geopolitical reach and limits
- Wide acceptance but important exceptions: The Convention has been ratified by well over 160 parties, making it a near-universal instrument. Nonetheless, some major maritime powers have not become parties, most notably the United States, which has accepted many aspects of UNCLOS as customary law yet has not ratified the treaty. This gap has strategic implications for the universal enforcement of certain UNCLOS provisions, particularly where great-power naval interests intersect with coastal-state jurisdiction.
- Balance of interests: UNCLOS embodies a negotiated compromise between coastal states — seeking control over adjacent resources and environmental stewardship — and maritime powers — insisting on freedom of navigation and transit. That balance undergirds contemporary disputes over fisheries, seabed mining, freedom of navigation operations and maritime boundary delimitation.

Practical salience for India’s strategic culture and national security
UNCLOS is not an abstract code for India; it informs doctrine, resource policy and diplomatic and legal strategies:
- Resource management and economic rights: The EEZ and continental-shelf regimes provide the legal basis for India’s claims to offshore fisheries, hydrocarbons and seabed mineral resources, and for regulatory control over activities in these spaces.
- Boundary delimitation and dispute settlement: UNCLOS-based principles and its dispute-settlement institutions have become central tools for resolving maritime boundary issues and delimiting entitlements, especially in crowded littoral regions such as the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. The availability of tribunal and arbitration processes has altered how states approach negotiation and litigation over maritime space.
- Environmental and maritime governance: UNCLOS obligations on marine pollution, conservation and cooperation shape India’s maritime environmental policies and its participation in regional and global ocean governance.
- Strategic balancing: For India — a rising maritime power that also shares interests with coastal neighbours — UNCLOS offers a legal architecture that helps reconcile coastal jurisdictional claims with the navigational freedoms essential to global and regional commerce and naval operations.

Conclusion
UNCLOS is foundational to contemporary maritime order: it codifies long-standing practice, reconciles coastal and navigational interests, institutionalises dispute resolution, and supplies juridical tools for delimitation and resource governance. For India’s strategic culture, the Convention supplies both rights to exploit maritime resources and predictable legal mechanisms that can be employed to manage disputes and advance national security and economic objectives in the maritime domain.
