    "enhanced_section_content_md": "## Introduction — The United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC), 1946–1952\n\nThe United Nations Atomic Energy Commission (UNAEC) was the first multilateral effort to grapple with the political, technical and moral dilemmas created by the advent of atomic energy. Created on 24 January 1946 by the first resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the Commission embodied the immediate post‑war hope that international machinery could be designed to both harness atomic energy for peaceful progress and prevent its use as an instrument of mass destruction.\n\nMandate and core tasks\n- The General Assembly charged UNAEC with a tightly focused but ambitious brief: to propose practical measures that would (a) extend the exchange of basic scientific information about atomic energy for peaceful ends; (b) propose controls on atomic energy development sufficient to ensure it would be used only for peaceful purposes; (c) propose elimination from national armaments of atomic weapons and “all other major weapons adaptable to mass destruction”; and (d) design effective safeguards — including inspection arrangements — to protect complying states against violations and evasions.\n- The combination of technical governance (information exchange, safeguards and inspections) and political disarmament (elimination from national armaments) made the Commission’s work simultaneously legal, diplomatic and technical.\n\nEarly work, reporting and the mounting impasse\n- UNAEC worked rapidly: its first substantive inputs reached the Security Council on 31 December 1946. The General Assembly, anxious for speedy resolution, urged completion of UNAEC’s report on 14 December 1946 and asked the Security Council to give it priority consideration.\n- On 10 March 1947 the Security Council welcomed the Commission’s work but described any Council conclusion as preliminary and requested a second UNAEC report. By 4 November 1948 the General Assembly had examined the Commission’s first three reports and formally recorded “deep concern” about the clear impasse shown by the third report.\n- The impasse hardened through 1947–1949; by July 1949 UNAEC was effectively inactive and, after several years of dormancy, the General Assembly formally dissolved the Commission in 1952.\n\nThe Baruch Plan and the political deadlock\n- On 14 June 1946 the United States representative Bernard M. Baruch presented a detailed U.S. proposal — the Baruch Plan — to the UN. Its essential bargain was stark: the United States would place its atomic capabilities under international authority (and ultimately destroy its national stockpile) only after an international control system, capable of intrusive verification and not subject to unilateral veto, was established and operating.\n- The Baruch Plan sought to couple affirmative disarmament with intrusive international controls designed to prevent clandestine weapons development. It was a decisive moment in the Commission’s work: the plan set forth a model of verification and enforcement that anticipated many later safeguards ideas.\n- Political reaction split. While the Baruch Plan found supporters in the Commission and among many Western states, the Soviet Union rejected its premises. Soviet objections—rooted in fears about sovereignty, security and the risk of perpetuating U.S. monopoly by procedural means—helped turn the Commission’s technical exercises into a Cold War political standoff. By early 1947, and certainly by 1948, it was clear that substantive agreement along the lines of the Baruch Plan was unlikely.\n\nConsequences and legacy\n- The practical effect of UNAEC’s failure was consequential. The Commission’s inability to bridge the security and sovereignty divides contributed to the breakdown of early attempts at global nuclear restraint and helped set the conditions for independent national nuclear programmes and the nuclear arms race.\n- Yet UNAEC was not without durable intellectual and institutional legacies. The Commission’s emphasis on international exchange for peaceful purposes, the articulation of safeguards and inspection mechanisms, and the idea that technical verification could be central to disarmament all survived the political impasse. These concepts re‑emerged in later multilateral instruments and institutions:\n  - The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), established in 1957, operationalized the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear energy together with on‑site safeguards and verification mechanisms.\n  - The Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968 institutionalized the distinction between non‑proliferation, disarmament obligations and peaceful use rights — a diplomatic architecture that UNAEC had attempted but could not realize.\n  - Modern verification practice — routine reporting, on‑site inspections and material accountancy — can be traced in part to the inspection models UNAEC debated.\n\nRelevance for India’s strategic culture and nuclear policy\n- For states emerging from colonial rule and for non‑aligned actors such as India, the UNAEC episode was instructive on several counts. The immediate post‑war period exposed the limits of great‑power consensus and the risks of arrangements perceived as discriminatory or as compromising sovereign control over sensitive technologies.\n- India’s subsequent signalling and policy choices — an early insistence on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, Nehru’s public advocacy for disarmament, and later scepticism about treaties that institutionalized a permanent division between “nuclear” and “non‑nuclear” states — reflect this ambivalent legacy. The failure of early collective control efforts reinforced Indian thinking that national autonomy, normative claims to peaceful nuclear rights, and a demand for universal, non‑discriminatory arrangements would be central to any acceptable global nuclear order.\n- In short, UNAEC’s mixture of technical foresight and political failure helps explain two strands in India’s strategic culture: (1) an appreciation for international technical institutions that can enable peaceful development (later engagement with the IAEA); and (2) a long‑standing wariness of multilateral frameworks perceived as legitimizing unequal status among states (a key element in India’s posture toward the NPT and subsequent non‑proliferation regimes).\n\nConclusion\nUNAEC was an early, ambitious attempt to translate the shock of the atomic age into structured international governance. Its substantive proposals — especially on information exchange, safeguards and inspections — anticipated later institutional practice. Its political failure, driven by emergent Cold War distrust and competing conceptions of sovereignty and security, left a lasting imprint on global nuclear politics and on the strategic calculations of states like India that would later navigate a world of constrained multilateralism and contested norms."
