# Introduction — Group of 77 (G77)

The Group of 77 (G77) is one of the oldest and most consequential collective platforms for developing countries within the United Nations system. Founded to advance the shared economic interests of the Global South, the G77 today functions as a large, flexible negotiating bloc that seeks to amplify the voice of developing states across trade, finance, industry, environment and development policy arenas. Though its name preserves the memory of its origin—seventy‑seven founding members—the grouping has expanded and now counts 134 members.

Origins and early institutional development
- Founding: The G77 was created on 15 June 1964 when the "Joint Declaration of the Seventy‑Seven Countries" was adopted at the first session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in Geneva. UNCTAD’s founding context—concern about unequal terms of trade, dependency, and the need for a development‑oriented global economic order—shaped the G77’s early priorities.
- First major meeting and Charter of Algiers: The grouping’s first major collective gathering occurred in Algiers in 1967, where the "Charter of Algiers" was adopted. That conference marked a shift from an ad hoc coalition to a body pursuing more permanent institutional capacities and common negotiating strategies.
- Leadership and intellectual orientation: The early institutional development of the G77 was influenced by leading development thinkers; Raúl Prebisch, a prominent economist associated with the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA/ECLAC) and UN policy circles, played a formative role. Prebisch’s emphasis on structural economic disparities and development policy reinforced the G77’s early economic-policy orientation—import‑substitution ideas, demand for fairer trade rules, and calls for measures to protect and promote nascent industries in the developing world.

Structure, presence and modalities
- Non‑treaty, flexible bloc: The G77 is not a treaty organization. It has no formal legal personality separate from its constituent states; rather it is a negotiating coalition that organizes through the UN system. This flexibility has allowed it to grow and to form issue‑specific positions, but it also means institutional capacities remain limited and dependent on the UN secretariat and national capitals.
- Secretariat and UN presence: While the G77 operates across the UN system, much of its coordination takes place in cities that host major UN bodies and specialized agencies. Geneva is frequently identified as a central locus for the G77’s activities because of the concentration of multilateral trade, labour, health and human rights forums there, though the Group’s work is coordinated across New York, Geneva and specialized agency locations.
- Functional and regional chapters: To project unified positions across specialized policy domains and locations, the G77 maintains regional and functional chapters at major international organizations. Notable chapters include:
  - Geneva — the UN and multilateral forums based there;
  - Rome — Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO);
  - Vienna — United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and other Vienna‑based agencies;
  - Paris — UNESCO and cultural/educational forums;
  - Nairobi — United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP);
  - Washington, D.C. — the Group of 24 (G24), a related but distinct body focused specifically on international monetary and financial issues before the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
- Chairmanship and representation: The chairmanship of the G77 typically rotates among member states, with the chair country serving as the movement’s spokesperson and agenda‑setter for the year. According to the current sequence, Iraq holds the chairmanship for 2025, succeeding Uganda. Rotation helps ensure geographic representation but also means policy emphases can shift annually with the chair’s priorities.

Core purpose and policy emphases
- Collective economic interests and negotiating capacity: The G77’s principal goal is to promote the collective economic interests of developing countries and to strengthen their joint negotiating capacity within the UN and other multilateral institutions. It has historically prioritized trade justice, development financing, technology transfer, market access and protection of policy space for industrialization.
- South–South cooperation: A defining ideological thread is South–South cooperation—solidarity among developing countries that emphasizes mutual support, technical and technological exchange, capacity‑building, and cooperative development projects that reduce dependence on developed countries.
- Functional reach: By maintaining chapters at specialized agencies, the G77 aims to coordinate positions across multiple policy domains—trade, agriculture, industry, environment, culture and development finance—and thus to translate broad development goals into concrete multilateral negotiation stances.

Challenges and limits
- Heterogeneity of members: One persistent challenge is the great heterogeneity within the G77—differences in economic size, development trajectories, regional priorities and diplomatic orientations. This diversity complicates efforts to produce unified positions, particularly on politically sensitive or technically complex issues (e.g., climate finance, intellectual property, digital governance).
- Institutional capacity: The G77’s informal, coalition‑based structure confers flexibility but limits enforcement or implementation capacity. Its effectiveness depends heavily on diplomatic coordination, the skill of chairs and presidencies, and the capacity of national delegations.
- Competition and fragmentation: The emergence of other multilateral clubs and groupings (BRICS, G20, African Union, regional trade blocs) sometimes overlaps with or competes with G77 efforts, creating both opportunities for cross‑coalition leverage and risks of fragmentation.

Relation to other bodies: the Group of 24 (G24)
- The Group of 24 is a related but distinct mechanism that focuses specifically on international monetary and financial matters, representing developing countries’ interests in forums such as the IMF and the World Bank. It is functionally complementary to the G77’s broader development diplomacy.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Platform for economic diplomacy: For India, a founding and long‑standing member of the G77, the grouping provides an important multilateral platform to pursue economic diplomacy. India has used the G77 to advocate for development finance, technology transfer and fairer trade rules—issues that directly affect India’s economic security and development strategy.
- Strategic autonomy and coalition building: Participation in the G77 is consistent with India’s strategic culture of non‑alignment and strategic autonomy. The Group enables India to construct coalitions that can counterbalance developed country positions in multilateral negotiations without binding India into exclusive security or economic alliances.
- Developmental security and domestic linkages: The G77’s emphasis on South‑South cooperation supports India’s domestic development priorities—industrialisation, technology indigenization, food security and energy access—which are integral to long‑term national security. Securing access to technology and favorable trade outcomes through G77 channels can reduce vulnerabilities.
- Regional leadership and soft power: India’s active engagement in the G77 contributes to its regional and global leadership narratives. By championing issues of concern to other developing countries, India reinforces its soft power and diplomatic reach in Asia, Africa and beyond.
- Limits and trade‑offs: However, the heterogeneity of the G77 means India must often balance collective positions with national interests, especially where rapidly changing national capacities (e.g., India’s emergence as a major services exporter and as an aspirant for advanced technology cooperation) create divergence with less‑developed members.

Concluding note
The Group of 77 remains a central institutional vehicle through which developing countries seek to shape the rules, norms and instruments of the global economic order. For India, the G77 is both an instrument of development diplomacy and a space in which the country’s strategic culture—rooted in coalition‑building, developmentalism and strategic autonomy—finds practical expression. Understanding the G77’s origin, structure, strengths and limits is therefore essential for any analysis of how India navigates multilateralism in pursuit of its national security and development objectives.

## Policies

Overview

The Group of 77 (G77) — founded in 1964 as a coalition of 77 developing countries and now numbering well over 130 members — has long functioned as a collective voice for the Global South within the United Nations system. Though heterogeneous in composition and interest, the group has developed recurring policy postures that reflect a shared emphasis on development, sovereignty and distributive justice in global governance. These positions have left a marked imprint on debates ranging from decolonization and disarmament to international economic reform and contemporary climate politics.

Historical and normative commitments

- Anti-apartheid and decolonization: In its early decades the G77 was credited with forging a unified diplomatic stance against apartheid and other colonial vestiges. The grouping’s solidarity provided diplomatic weight to campaigns for racial justice and political self-determination, reinforcing the wider Third World push for structural change in international affairs.

- Support for disarmament: The G77 has regularly supported global disarmament initiatives, framing arms reduction as a prerequisite for redirecting scarce resources into development. This position is rooted in the view that security for many developing states is inseparable from economic security and from the diversion of resources away from welfare and infrastructure.

- The New International Economic Order (NIEO): During the 1960s–1980s the G77 championed the NIEO — a program advocating more equitable trade rules, technology transfer, and development finance to correct structural imbalances in the world economy. The NIEO articulated a durable principle of economic justice that continues to inform the group’s negotiating rhetoric even when the original program lost traction.

Environmental policy and climate negotiation posture

- Common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR): The G77 has been a consistent and influential proponent of CBDR. This principle holds that while all states have obligations to protect the global environment, developed countries have greater historical responsibility for environmental degradation and greater capacity to act.

- Per‑capita emissions and historical responsibility: G77 statements routinely emphasize per‑capita emissions disparities between developed and developing countries and point to historical cumulative emissions as a basis for differentiated treatment and financial/technological assistance.

- Resistance to binding emissions commitments for developing states: Consequent to the equity framing, the G77 has often resisted internationally binding emissions‑reduction commitments for itself — especially in the form of mandatory targets without concomitant finance, technology transfer and development space. This posture helped shape the politics around instruments such as the Kyoto Protocol and later UNFCCC negotiations.

- Policy trade‑offs: The group typically treats environmental measures as secondary to, or conditional on, economic development and poverty eradication. G77 negotiators insist that climate and environmental policy must not imperil development objectives for the poorest countries.

- Rio (1992) as an illustrative episode: The 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development exemplified the tensions and mutual criticisms between developed and developing states — with the G77 asserting development priorities and richer states criticizing what they saw as insufficient environmental ambition or leadership among some developing partners.

Political economy, criticism, and defense

- Criticisms: The G77 has been criticized — by some observers and some developed states — for either weak endorsement of ambitious pro‑environmental initiatives or for obstructing efforts to secure binding global commitments. Critics argue that such stances can slow collective action needed to address global environmental threats.

- Defenses and rationale: Supporters counter that the G77’s positions defend legitimate developmental equity: without adequate climate finance, technology transfer and recognition of historical responsibility, binding constraints on developing economies risk perpetuating poverty and inequity. For many members, the immediate imperative remains economic growth and poverty eradication.

Negotiation dynamics and internal heterogeneity

- Heterogeneous membership: Although the G77 acts as a bloc rhetorically, it is internally diverse — encompassing least‑developed countries, small island states, commodity exporters, and large emerging economies. This heterogeneity creates fault lines between low‑income states that prioritize adaptation and development support and more advanced developing countries that may be willing to accept stronger mitigation responsibilities.

- “G77 and China”: In many multilateral fora the coalition operates as “G77 and China.” China is not a member per se but aligns frequently with the group and provides diplomatic muscle, complicating assessments of the bloc’s collective negotiating posture.

- Impact on outcomes: The combination of common claims to equity and internal diversity means the G77 often succeeds in anchoring equity norms — notably CBDR — in treaty language, while its internal divisions and the differing interests of larger members shape how far the group will push on specific obligations.

Influence on international negotiations

- Kyoto and beyond: The G77’s insistence on differentiated responsibilities and development priorities influenced the design and political dynamics of the Kyoto Protocol era and subsequent UNFCCC processes. Resistance to mandatory commitments for developing states has been one factor shaping the move toward more nationally determined approaches (e.g., NDCs under the Paris framework), alongside parallel pressures from developed states and emerging‑economy diplomatic strategies.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

- India within the G77: India has been a prominent voice within the G77 and has repeatedly invoked the NIEO lineage, CBDR, and the primacy of development in its international diplomacy. These positions align with central features of India’s strategic culture: a prioritization of economic development, insistence on strategic autonomy, and an emphasis on equity in international rules.

- Policy utility and constraints: India’s engagement with the G77 allows it to marshal collective bargaining power around development and equity claims. At the same time, India’s status as a large emerging economy sometimes places it in tension with the poorest members, forcing Delhi to negotiate between solidarity and its own developmental and strategic interests. This balance influences India’s posture on climate commitments, transfer and finance demands, and broader negotiations that intersect with national security aims (energy access, infrastructural resilience, and economic stability).

Conclusion

The G77’s policy repertoire — from anti‑apartheid solidarity and disarmament advocacy to NIEO demands and the contemporary reiteration of CBDR — is unified by an overarching equity/development logic. That logic shapes global negotiations on environmental and security questions and constrains the pace and form of collective action. For India, participation in the G77 serves both principled and pragmatic ends: it reinforces India’s claim to developmental justice and negotiating leverage, while also demanding careful calibration between solidarity with poorer states and India’s evolving strategic ambitions as an emerging power.

### Group of 77 — membership statement and analytical note (header: "Group of 77 countries as of 2013")

Overview and primary claim
- The text under this heading contains an internal date inconsistency: the header reads “as of 2013” while the body formulates membership “as of 2023.” This must be resolved before treating the passage as an authoritative snapshot.
- The core claim in the body frames G77 membership as: effectively all UN member states plus the UN observer State of Palestine, with explicit exclusions of specific country-groupings and two Pacific microstates. In other words, membership is treated as broadly coterminous with the developing world in the UN system, subtracting most developed-country blocs and a small set of exceptions.

Explicit exclusion categories and what they mean
- Members of the Council of Europe, except Azerbaijan
  - Interpretation: most Council of Europe members are treated as outside the G77; Azerbaijan is singled out as not excluded (i.e., it is treated as part of the G77 despite Council of Europe membership).
  - Implication: the exclusion rule is not purely institutional — regional and political realities create exceptions.
- Members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Free Trade Area, except Tajikistan
  - Interpretation: most CIS FTA members are listed as excluded from G77 membership, while Tajikistan is an exception and remains part of the G77.
  - Implication: once again, regional economic groupings do not mechanically determine G77 status; geopolitical and developmental criteria matter.
- Members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), except for its four Latin American members
  - Clarification: the parenthetical “four” Latin American OECD members are Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica; these four are treated as included in the G77 while other OECD members are excluded.
  - Implication: the exception underscores that OECD membership (a proxy for higher-income/developed economies) is not an absolute bar to participation in a developing-country coalition — regional identity and development self-identification can override institutional affiliation.
- Two microstates in Oceania: Palau and Tuvalu
  - These two Pacific microstates are specifically excluded from the G77 list in the passage.

Additional factual and historical context (important for accurate analysis)
- Palestine is a UN observer state (not a full UN member) but is explicitly counted among the G77 constituents in the cited formulation. This reflects the political and diplomatic choice of the G77 to include Palestine in its grouping.
- The Group of 77 was founded in 1964 by 77 developing countries; the name has been retained despite later expansions in membership. Its purpose historically has been to coordinate the negotiating positions of the developing world within the UN system.
- The listed exclusions broadly align with groupings seen as higher-income or integrated into Western/democratic European institutional structures — a pattern that reinforces G77’s identity as a developing-country collective.

Analytical implications (with relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy)
- The passage’s definition—that G77 ≈ (UN members + Palestine) − (selected developed/institutional blocs and two Pacific microstates—emphasizes the group’s intended universality among developing countries. For India, this universality has strategic utility:
  - Coalition building: A broadly inclusive G77 provides India with a platform for South–South coordination on trade, development finance, climate equity, and reform of global governance institutions.
  - Diplomatic identity: India’s long-standing engagement with the G77 is consistent with its postcolonial, non-aligned and later strategic emphasis on leadership within the developing world.
  - Geographic reach: Exceptions such as Azerbaijan and Tajikistan illustrate that regional politics and bilateral relations can override simplistic institutional exclusions; this is relevant to India’s outreach in Central Asia and the Caucasus, where bilateral ties and strategic interests may place states inside or outside India’s preferred negotiating coalitions.
- The exclusion of OECD and Council of Europe members underlines the G77’s function as a counterweight to Western-led economic and political policy agendas — a dynamic India has exploited to negotiate differentiated responsibilities and special treatment in trade and climate fora.
- Inclusion of Palestine signals the political character of the G77 as not merely an economic club but also a forum for solidarities based on anti-colonial and political-status concerns — a dimension India has historically engaged with in its foreign policy.

Notes of caution and recommended actions for scholars and policy analysts
- Resolve the date discrepancy: determine whether the intended snapshot is 2013 or 2023. Using an inconsistent temporal label risks analytical error.
- Verify authoritative membership: consult the official Group of 77 (G77) Secretariat website and UN records for the current and historical membership lists and any formal membership criteria or declarations. These are the primary sources for accurate enumeration and dates.
- If a precise list of excluded versus included UN members is required (for quantitative analysis, voting bloc mapping, or policy simulation), map the exclusion categories to specific country lists (Council of Europe membership roster, CIS FTA membership list, OECD membership list) and then apply the stated exceptions (Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, the four Latin American OECD members, Palestine’s observer status, and Palau/Tuvalu).
- Treat the institutional exclusions as analytical shorthand rather than immutable rules; exceptions (Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, certain Latin American OECD members) demonstrate that G77 composition can be shaped by political, regional, and developmental self-identification considerations.

Concise conclusion for the book’s argument
- The passage, properly verified and temporally clarified, can be read as an attempt to characterise G77 membership as functionally inclusive of the developing world within the UN system while explicitly excluding most Western/developed institutional members. For India’s strategic culture and national-security diplomacy, the G77 remains an instrument for projecting influence, building South–South coalitions, and negotiating differentiated treatment in global governance — but its precise membership and the political logic of exceptions must always be verified against primary sources.

## Group of 77 — “Current founding members” (list analysed)

This short analytical note examines a provided list labelled “Current founding members” of the Group of 77 (G77). The list contains 75 country entries; the name “Group of 77” is a historical reference to the original membership at UNCTAD I (1964). Below I (a) summarise the immediate data issues and regional patterning in the supplied list, (b) place the discrepancy in its historical and diplomatic context (including relevance for India’s strategic culture), and (c) offer concrete, practical recommendations for cleaning, verifying and using such lists in research or policy work.

1. Immediate data appraisal
- Stated total in the input: 75 country names. This conflicts with the “77” in the Group of 77 name. Possible reasons: transcription error, omission of two founding names, or confusion between “founding” and “current” membership. The G77 currently counts many more members (membership has expanded since 1964), but the phrase “founding members” refers to the original set.
- Regional composition in the supplied list (as counted in the input): Africa 32, Asia incl. Middle East 22, Latin America & Caribbean 21. This distribution confirms the G77’s character as an Afro‑Asian‑Latin American coalition — a manifestation of the Global South negotiating bloc.
- Naming inconsistencies and ambiguities:
  - “Congo” is ambiguous: the list also contains “DR Congo.” For clarity these should be standardised to “Republic of the Congo (Congo‑Brazzaville)” and “Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo‑Kinshasa).”
  - Abbreviations (e.g., “DR Congo”) should be expanded and normalised to one canonical short-form name.
  - Some entries classify countries by region in varying ways (e.g., Egypt, Libya, Morocco listed as Africa/Arab world). For data analysis use one canonical region schema.

2. Cleaned, standardised version of the supplied list (75 entries)
Below I present the same entries in standard short‑form country names and region tags for clarity (this is a standardisation of the provided input; it does not assert that this is the official founding list of 1964):

1. Afghanistan — Asia

3. Argentina — Latin America & Caribbean  
4. Bangladesh — Asia  
5. Benin — Africa  
6. Bolivia — Latin America & Caribbean  
7. Brazil — Latin America & Caribbean  
8. Burkina Faso — Africa  
9. Burundi — Africa

72. Uruguay — Latin America & Caribbean  
73. Venezuela — Latin America & Caribbean  
74. Vietnam — Asia  
75. Yemen — Asia / Middle East

Notes on this cleaned list:
- The list above is a standardisation of the supplied dataset only. It makes no claim that these 75 are the complete or correct set of the 77 historical founders.
- Where a name was ambiguous I expanded it to the commonly used short form and appended the common parenthetical disambiguator (e.g., Congo‑Brazzaville vs Congo‑Kinshasa).

3. Historical and diplomatic context (brief)
- Formation: The Group of 77 was created in June 1964 at the first United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD I) in Geneva. It emerged as a coalition of developing states seeking a collective voice in international economic negotiations and development policy.
- Name persistence: Although the numerical membership has changed and expanded (the G77 later expanded its membership beyond 77), the original name “Group of 77” has been retained as a historical brand and marker of the South–South political identity.
- India’s place: India was among the early and continuing participants in the G77; the group provided a diplomatic platform consonant with India’s post‑colonial foreign policy preferences—non‑alignment, Third World solidarity, and coalition building on economic justice and development rights. For India’s strategic culture, engagement with the G77 has been an instrument of normative influence (developmental diplomacy), coalition bargaining in the UN, and a means to shape global economic governance.

4. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Diplomatic leverage: India’s sustained involvement in the G77 has multiplied its diplomatic reach among Global South states. This has strategic utility: coordinated positions in multilateral fora (UNGA, UNCTAD, climate negotiations) help protect developmental policy space and resist policy prescriptions that might constrain economic autonomy.
- Soft power and normative alignment: Participation in the G77 reinforces India’s identity as a leader of the Global South and supports narratives used in its strategic outreach — technology transfer, capacity building, and South–South cooperation (e.g., medical diplomacy, lines of credit).
- Security‑development nexus: For Indian policymakers, advancing development-oriented multilateral norms through the G77 reduces vulnerabilities that could otherwise have security implications (economic dependency, trade asymmetries, and contested resource access).
- Coalition constraints: The G77 is diverse and not always cohesive; India must calibrate issue‑based coalitions, recognising divergent interests across Africa, Asia and Latin America. India’s strategic culture prizes autonomous manoeuvre and therefore seeks flexible subgroupings within larger coalitions.

5. Recommendations for data hygiene and verification
If this list is to be used in scholarly or policy output, proceed as follows:
- Primary verification: Cross‑check every entry against primary archival sources: the UNCTAD I records (1964), the G77 Secretariat records, and UN membership roll calls for UNCTAD founding participants. The G77 Secretariat and UN archives are the authoritative sources.
- Timestamp every snapshot: indicate whether the list claims to represent “founding (1964)”, “founding — current members retaining founder status”, or “current membership (2024 snapshot)”. This avoids conflation of founding versus current members.
- Standardise names and include ISO codes: normalise country names to ISO short‑forms and append ISO α‑3 codes (e.g., India — IND). Doing so reduces ambiguity for downstream data work.
- Resolve ambiguous names explicitly: where “Congo” appears, use “Republic of the Congo (Congo‑Brazzaville)” and “Democratic Republic of the Congo (Congo‑Kinshasa).”
- Produce machine‑readable output: compile a cleaned CSV or spreadsheet with columns: canonical_name, iso_a3, region, original_input_name, note_on_discrepancy, source_reference, snapshot_date.

6. Suggested follow‑up actions (practical)
- Reconcile this 75‑member list with the official G77 founding list. If you intend to state “founding members,” validate against the UNCTAD I participant roster.
- Correct ambiguous names in source data and re‑export as a standard CSV with ISO codes and a timestamp.
- If the list is to be cited in a chapter on India’s strategic posture, pair it with a short analytical subsection showing how India has used G77 mechanisms in specific diplomatic campaigns (trade and development issues, climate finance negotiations, etc.) — i.e., illustrate the general claims above with one or two case studies.

7. Methodological tip for scholars
- When summarising long country lists in analytic prose, keep a one‑row‑per‑country approach in appendices or datasets, and use compact aggregate bullets in the main text. This preserves clarity without overwhelming the narrative.

Concluding remark
The supplied list is a useful starting dataset illustrating the G77’s Global South composition, but it requires verification and standardisation before use in academic or policy work. For a chapter on India’s strategic culture, the key interpretive point is that the G77 served — and still serves — as an institutional resource for India’s developmental diplomacy and coalition practice, enabling New Delhi to project influence, protect policy space, and cultivate strategic partnerships across Africa, Asia and Latin America.

## The Group of 77 — “Other current members”: composition, heterogeneity, and implications for Indian strategic policy

Summary
- The catalogue of 60 states presented as “Other current members” of the Group of 77 (G77) illustrates the coalition’s remarkable heterogeneity. The list mixes Small Island Developing States (SIDS), least-developed countries (LDCs), middle‑income and resource‑rich states, Gulf petro‑states, and larger developing powers (notably China, which is usually treated as a special partner: “G77+China”). Understanding this membership is essential for mapping UN negotiating dynamics and for any state—India included—seeking to build coalitions and defend development, trade and security priorities in multilateral fora.

50. South Africa — Southern Africa; regional power and leading voice in developing coalitions.  
51. South Sudan — East‑Central Africa; newest African state, low‑income.  
52. Suriname — South America (Caribbean ties); resource‑rich, small population.  
53. Tajikistan — Central Asia; landlocked, mountainous.  
54. Timor‑Leste — Southeast Asia; young nation, developing state.  
55. Tonga — Pacific; SIDS.  
56. Turkmenistan — Central Asia; gas‑exporting, authoritarian.  
57. United Arab Emirates — Gulf; wealthy federation, economic hub.  
58. Vanuatu — Pacific; SIDS, climate‑vulnerable.  
59. Zambia — Southern/Central Africa; landlocked developing country.  
60. Zimbabwe — Southern Africa; economy facing structural challenges.

Analytical observations (what this composition signifies)
- High heterogeneity: The group cannot be read as economically or politically homogeneous. It spans extreme vulnerability (SIDS, LDCs) to high per‑capita wealth (Gulf states, Singapore, Brunei). That heterogeneity shapes agenda‑setting and constrains the capacity for monolithic policy positions.  
- Political/diplomatic vs. economic criteria: Presence of wealthy or high‑income members (e.g., Singapore, UAE, Qatar, Brunei) highlights that G77 membership and cooperation are often driven by diplomatic alignment, South–South solidarity and strategic interests rather than narrow income classification.  
- China’s special role: China commonly partners with the G77 as “G77+China,” offering diplomatic backing, development finance and technical cooperation; yet it remains a distinct actor whose priorities are not always congruent with the majority of members.  
- Shared vulnerabilities and convergences: Many members—particularly SIDS and LDCs—share common concerns: climate change impacts and financing, limited fiscal space, overdependence on a narrow set of exports (commodities, tourism), and technology gaps. These shared vulnerabilities form the backbone of much G77 advocacy.  
- Issue concentrations: The G77 is a primary vehicle for collective bargaining on development finance, trade rules, climate justice (adaptation finance, loss and damage), technology transfer and UN institutional reforms.  
- Coalition dynamics: The diversity of membership makes consensus necessary and difficult. Middle powers and regional leaders (e.g., South Africa, Egypt in the broader G77) often mediate between divergent interests.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Platform for leadership in the Global South: India’s long‑standing engagement with the G77 advances core elements of its strategic culture—non‑alignment roots, emphasis on sovereignty and development, and advocacy for a multipolar global order. India can use the G77 to amplify calls for greater development finance, technology transfer on favorable terms, and reform of global governance institutions (including the UN Security Council and Bretton Woods institutions).  
- Diplomatic leverage and soft power: India’s development partnerships (lines of credit, capacity building, vaccine diplomacy) are consonant with G77 priorities and can deepen bilateral ties with SIDS, African states, and Southeast Asian members. This enhances India’s influence without overt coercive instruments, consistent with its preference for soft‑power projection.  
- Managing heterogeneity for strategic ends: India must navigate the group’s internal diversity—aligning with LDC/SIDS priorities on climate and development while engaging resource‑rich and Gulf members on energy, labor and economic ties. Crafting common positions requires India to practise nuanced coalition management, drawing on regional affinities (SAARC, IORA) and bilateral leverage.  
- Security implications: Collective G77 positions on issues such as climate change, food security, technology control regimes and maritime governance intersect with India’s national security concerns. For example, climate vulnerabilities of Indian Ocean SIDS affect regional stability and require cooperative disaster response and maritime engagement—areas where India’s naval diplomacy and development assistance contribute to security objectives.  
- Balancing China and other major actors: China’s partnership with the G77 presents both an opportunity (shared development rhetoric, financing channels) and a strategic challenge (competing influence). India’s engagement must emphasize differentiated cooperation—where interests align—while preserving policy autonomy and advancing Indian priorities (connectivity norms, transparency in projects).  
- Reputation and normative stance: Association with a group containing authoritarian or politically contentious members (e.g., DPRK, Turkmenistan) obliges careful diplomatic positioning. India’s strategic culture—valuing democratic credentials and rule‑based order—requires balancing solidarity with the Global South and commitment to normative stances in multilateral fora.  
- Practical policy levers: India can exploit the G77 platform for specific policy aims that tie to national security: pushing for technology transfer in critical sectors (clean energy, agriculture, digital infrastructure), mobilizing support for developmental financing that reduces regional instability, and coordinating on migration/labor issues that affect India’s diaspora and economic interests.

Conclusion — strategic utility and constraints
- The “Other current members” list is a reminder that the G77 is a politically potent but internally diverse coalition. For India, the grouping offers a durable multilateral avenue to project influence, pursue development diplomacy, and protect strategic interests linked to regional stability, resource access and normative leadership. Success requires tailored diplomacy: recognising the specific vulnerabilities and priorities of SIDS and LDCs; engaging resource‑rich and Gulf members on mutual economic interests; managing China’s role; and using development cooperation as both a policy tool and a component of national security strategy. Understanding the membership map is therefore a necessary precondition for effective coalition building and informed multilateral strategy.

### Former Members of the Group of 77: membership change, causes and lessons for Indian strategic practice

Summary
- The Group of 77 (G77) was established as a coalition of developing states within the UN to promote collective economic interests in multilateral fora. Its membership record, however, is dynamic. States leave or are removed for a mixture of objective status changes (economic development, OECD or EU accession), political transformations (state dissolution, unification), and deliberate strategic realignments (joining more issue‑specific coalitions). These trajectories are analytically useful for understanding how states recalibrate multilateral alignments—an important element of India’s strategic culture and foreign policy toolkit.

Former members (brief profiles and reasons for exit/removal)
- Mexico
  - Founding member of the G77. Ceased to participate as a developing‑country coalition after joining the OECD in 1994. OECD accession signalled a shift in Mexico’s external economic identity and negotiating posture.
- New Zealand
  - Signed the 1963 “Joint Declaration of the Developing Countries” but withdrew prior to the formal G77 founding in 1964; later joined the OECD in 1973. Illustrates early, pre‑formation realignments.
- South Korea
  - Founding member. Left the G77 following OECD accession in 1996, again reflecting a change in perceived development status and diplomatic alignment.
- Yugoslavia
  - Founding member and G77 chair in 1985–86. By the late 1990s it was listed as unable to participate; removed from membership lists in late 2003 as the state fragmented and international status changed.
- Bosnia and Herzegovina
  - Tied to the Yugoslav succession story: listed on the G77 website in 2007 but removed from the member list in February 2020. Its inclusion and later removal highlight the lag and ambiguity that can attend membership lists after state dissolution.
- Cyprus
  - Sometimes recorded as a founding member in secondary summaries but absent from post‑2004 membership lists after EU accession. A 1975 G77 document reportedly indicates Cyprus was not a member, exposing a discrepancy in historical records.
- South Vietnam
  - Listed among founding members; its successor, the unified Vietnam, did not appear as a separate predecessor member (North Vietnam did not join separately). Example of how civil war/unification complicates continuity of membership.
- South Yemen
  - Joined as a separate entity between 1967 and 1975 (while North Yemen was a founding member), before Yemeni unification. Again shows how partitioned polities produce multiple entries and later consolidation.
- Malta
  - Admitted in 1976; removed from active lists following EU accession in 2004.
- Palau
  - Joined the G77 in 2002 but withdrew in 2004 to pursue focused environmental diplomacy in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). This is a clear case of strategic realignment toward an issue‑specific coalition.
- Romania
  - Joined in 1976 and for internal G77 purposes was anomalously classed under “Latin America” because the G77 originally had no European regional grouping. Left after EU accession (joined EU in 2007), reflecting the broader pattern of European integration prompting exit from the G77.

Patterns and institutional dynamics
- OECD and EU accession as triggers for exit
  - A recurrent correlation: when members attain OECD membership or join the EU, they frequently cease to present themselves as part of the G77. These institutional shifts change states’ development narratives, bargaining power, and preferred coalitional partners.
- State dissolution, unification and succession
  - Breakup or unification (Yugoslavia, Vietnam, Yemen) produces ambiguity in membership records and in institutional participation. Successor states, interim governments and varying degrees of international recognition often produce temporary “unable to participate” listings or delayed removals.
- Strategic realignment to issue‑specific coalitions
  - Small island states (e.g., Palau) sometimes prefer narrowly focused groups like AOSIS for concentrated advocacy on climate and environmental security—areas of existential importance that a broad economic coalition may not prioritise.
- Administrative and archival inconsistencies
  - The G77’s membership lists have shown lag, contradictory entries (Cyprus), and ad hoc classifications (Romania under Latin America). These inconsistencies recommend caution in using snapshot lists as definitive evidence of a state’s diplomatic posture.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Reading coalition durability and exit triggers
  - India’s diplomacy must appreciate that multilateral coalitions are not static. Economic advancement, regional integration, or new security priorities can and will reshape alliances. Anticipating such shifts helps India manage expectations in collective bargaining and design durable, issue‑based partnerships.
- Leveraging continuity and leadership
  - Unlike many former members, India has maintained an active role in the G77. This continuity can be translated into leadership capital—using long‑standing participation to shape agendas, preserve solidarity on development finance and reform, and offer mediation when members realign.
- Issue‑specific strategy design
  - India should emulate successful strategic realignments by maintaining flexibility: engage in broader coalitions (G77, BRICS) for macroeconomic negotiation, while joining or leading specialised coalitions (climate, maritime security, technology governance) when specific national security interests are at stake.
- Diplomacy in contexts of state transformation
  - Experience with successor states in the G77 underscores the need for institutional processes to manage recognition, representation, and continuity of commitments—relevant when India engages with fragile or transforming neighbours whose international legal status and governance change rapidly.
- Research and intelligence considerations
  - Because official membership lists can lag or contain contradictions, Indian diplomats and analysts should corroborate G77 membership status through multiple sources (UN archives, G77 secretariat, national statements) before drawing operational conclusions.

Research and archival caveat
- Primary‑source verification
  - Given documented inconsistencies (e.g., Cyprus, Yugoslavia/Bosnia), researchers should consult original UN and G77 archival material, conference records and national communiqués to establish precise dates and rationales for membership changes. Treat secondary lists as indicative rather than dispositive.

Concluding observation
- Membership dynamics in the G77 reflect broader processes—economic development, regional integration, state transformation, and issue prioritisation—that also shape India’s external environment. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, an attentiveness to how and why states leave or reconfigure multilateral coalitions is instrumental in designing resilient, flexible, and interest‑congruent diplomacy.

### China and the Group of 77: A Special Relationship and Its Strategic Implications

Overview
- The Group of 77 (G77) was established in 1964 as a coalition of developing states within the United Nations aimed at promoting collective economic interests and amplifying the negotiating power of the Global South. Over time the G77 has become a durable platform for coordinated positions on development, trade, finance, climate policy and related multilateral negotiations.
- China occupies a unique position in relation to the G77. It appears in G77 rosters and in practice is treated as a partner in many G77 activities, yet Beijing declines to be a formal member. Official language in UN fora and in joint communiqués therefore commonly uses the formula “The Group of 77 and China” (frequently abbreviated G77+China). This naming convention encodes a deliberate diplomatic nuance: close alignment without full membership.

How the arrangement works in practice
- Political support and participation: China provides consistent political backing to many G77 positions. In negotiations where developing-country unity is valuable — for example on development finance, technology transfer, and climate mitigation/finance — China often speaks and votes alongside the G77 or co-signs joint positions.
- Financial contributions: Since 1994 China has made financial contributions to G77 activities and mechanisms. These contributions have practical impact — enabling coordination, funding meetings and enhancing the Group’s capacity — and carry symbolic weight, reinforcing China’s association with Global South causes.
- Naming and representation: Because China does not accept formal membership, official G77 outputs almost always attribute collective positions to “The Group of 77 and China.” The formula is more than semantics: it signals that China is an external but close partner, one whose support is welcomed but whose sovereignty of action remains intact.

Diplomatic logic and interpretation
- Compromise and flexibility: The G77+China formula is a negotiated compromise. It recognizes China’s political and financial contributions while simultaneously accommodating Beijing’s desire to retain a distinct international identity — as a major power and a permanent member of the UN Security Council — and to avoid the obligations and constraints that formal membership might imply.
- Functional alignment without institutional binding: That arrangement allows China to participate in collective Southern positions where useful, yet preserves freedom to dissent or pursue independent policies when Chinese interests diverge from the broader G77 line. In short, the relationship is strategic alignment, not institutional integration.

Legal and procedural character
- Political instrument, not governance merger: The G77+China formulation has political and rhetorical force in negotiations, but it does not create shared internal governance between China and the G77. It does not alter the G77’s internal decision‑making rules or confer membership rights on China; rather it is a representational convention used in public diplomacy and multilateral bargaining.
- Comparatives: Other blocs and coalitions employ similar associate or observer relationships with major powers; G77+China is therefore not unique but is tailored to the particular diplomatic profile of China.

Strategic consequences and utility for both sides
- For the G77: China’s association brings diplomatic heft — a major power’s voice and resources can help unify positions, attract attention, and strengthen bargaining power vis‑à‑vis developed states and multilateral institutions.
- For China: The arrangement provides flexible leverage. China can credibly claim alignment with developing-country demands and thus shape multilateral outcomes beneficial to its interests, while avoiding binding commitments that formal membership might imply.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- Coalition dynamics: For Indian diplomacy, the G77+China dynamic presents both opportunities and constraints. India, as a prominent developing country and an active member of the G77, must manage negotiations where China is simultaneously an ally of the Group and an independent great power with its own agendas.
- Balance and leadership: India can exploit moments of divergence between China and other G77 members to exercise leadership within the Group, shaping outcomes that align with Indian strategic and economic priorities. Conversely, when China successfully leverages its G77 association, New Delhi may face greater difficulty in isolating or countering Chinese positions in UN fora.
- Practical watchlist for Indian policymakers and analysts:
  - Frequency and subject matter of G77+China joint statements (to detect areas of deep alignment).
  - Instances where China abstains or dissents from G77 positions (to identify fault lines).
  - Patterns of Chinese funding and technical support for G77 activities (to assess leverage).
  - Evolution of language in communiqués (to see if the relationship moves toward closer institutionalization or remains deliberately informal).

Concluding remark
- The G77+China formula is an instructive example of contemporary multilateral diplomacy: it preserves the rhetorical and practical unity of the Global South while accommodating the differentiated status of a major power. For India’s strategic culture, this arrangement underscores the importance of nuanced coalition management — leveraging shared Southern platforms when useful, while remaining alert to the ways in which a great power’s associate role can reshape multilateral bargaining spaces.

## Annex: Chronology and Significance of G‑77 Chairmanships (1970–2025)

The Group of 77 (G‑77) — the principal coalition of developing countries within the United Nations system — has long used an annually rotating chair to coordinate collective positions, set agendas for South–South cooperation, and exercise diplomatic leadership within multilateral fora. The following section reproduces a chronological succession of G‑77 chairmanships from 1970 through 2025 and offers interpretive commentary on patterns, anomalies and the implications of chairmanship for member states’ strategic postures.

Analytical commentary: patterns, anomalies and explanatory threads

1. Rotation and geographic inclusivity
- The succession demonstrates the intentional geographic rotation characteristic of the G‑77: chairs come from Africa, Asia, Latin America & the Caribbean, and Oceania. This rotation preserves legitimacy across regions and reinforces the G‑77’s identity as a genuinely global coalition of developing countries.
- For member states, chairing is both symbolic and functional: it confers agenda‑setting capacity in major multilateral negotiations (trade, development finance, commodity policies) and an opportunity to demonstrate leadership within the Global South.

2. Repeated chairs and diplomatic activism
- Several states appear multiple times as chairs: Pakistan (4 times), Egypt and Algeria (3 times each), Mexico, India, Venezuela, Jamaica, Guyana and South Africa (multiple terms each). The recurrence signals sustained diplomatic investment, institutional capacity within their UN missions, and the strategic utility these countries derive from steering the G‑77.
- For rivals and neighbours (e.g., India and Pakistan), repeated chairs underscore the competition for influence within the same multilateral space. Pakistan’s four chairmanships are noteworthy in light of its historic rivalry with India and its use of multilateral platforms for policy leverage.

3. India’s chairmanship(s): implications for strategic culture and national security
- India chaired the G‑77 early (1970–71) and again in 1979–80. The early chairmanship is consonant with India’s Nehruvian foreign policy and Non‑Aligned Movement leadership: it used multilateral diplomacy to articulate a developmentalist, anti‑colonial agenda that linked economic grievances to strategic autonomy.
- Chairing the G‑77 advanced India’s strategic aims in several ways: it amplified Indian normative claims (just order, equity in international economic relations), expanded diplomatic networks for economic and technological cooperation, and bolstered India’s soft power among developing states — all elements that feed into a broader conception of national security (economic resilience, diplomatic autonomy, and international legitimacy).
- Reengagement with the G‑77 over time — visible in continued Indian participation and the initial chairs — should be read as part of India’s dual-track strategy: maintaining strategic independence while leveraging multilateral coalitions to offset asymmetries in global governance.

4. Historical and political special cases
- Yugoslavia’s 1985–86 chairmanship is a reminder of the G‑77’s historical ties with non‑aligned Europe and the shifting composition of mid‑late Cold War alignments. Yugoslavia is now a historical state; its inclusion requires contextualization in any longitudinal account.
- Palestine’s listing as the 2019 presiding entity reflects the G‑77’s political positions and the ways in which status and recognition debates intersect with South–South solidarity. Researchers must note the political sensitivity and record‑keeping implications of non‑UN‑member or non‑fully recognized entities chairing or presiding.

5. Notational inconsistencies, term lengths and data gaps
- The source exhibits inconsistent formatting: some entries are recorded as multi‑year ranges (e.g., 1970–71, 1974–75, 1985–86), others as single calendar years (e.g., 1987, 1990). This likely reflects either genuine multi‑year term practice at certain moments, differences in how the chairmanship was recorded (e.g., UN session years versus calendar years), or editorial inconsistency in the source.
- Apparent data oddities — such as a 1985–86 Yugoslavia term followed by a “1987 — Guatemala” entry, with no explicit 1986 single‑year listing — underline the importance of verifying precise start/end dates. Researchers should not assume uniform annual turnover without corroboration.

6. Research and verification
- For rigorous scholarly work, this chronology should be cross‑checked against official G‑77 Secretariat documents, UN archival records (General Assembly and relevant committees), and national foreign ministry releases. Such triangulation will establish exact term dates, reveal any exceptional extensions, and clarify the procedural norms that governed chairmanship in different periods.

Concluding observations for India’s strategic framing
- Chairing the G‑77 has been an instrument of Indian statecraft: it reinforced India’s identity as a leader of the developing world, provided an organising platform to press for equity in international economic governance, and served as a venue to cultivate relations that contribute to India’s broader national security objectives (economic, diplomatic and normative).
- More broadly, the pattern of chairs confirms that the G‑77 remains a contested and dynamic space where mid‑sized and smaller developing states can exercise influence. For Indian strategists and scholars, the history of G‑77 chairmanships offers insight into the mechanics of South–South coalition building and the ways in which multilateral leadership complements hard‑power and bilateral instruments in a country’s security toolkit.

Recommendation for further work
- Where precise temporal sequencing or the motivations behind particular chair selections are analytically important, consult primary G‑77 and UN records and contemporaneous national statements. Doing so will permit a tighter linkage between chairmanship events and concrete policy outcomes relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### The Group of 24 (G‑24)

Concise summary
- The Group of 24 (G‑24) is a finance‑focused chapter of the larger Group of 77 (G‑77). Established in 1971, it was created to coordinate the positions of developing countries on international monetary and development finance issues and to ensure their interests were adequately represented in negotiations on international monetary matters. All members of the G‑24 are also members of the G‑77.

Origins and mandate
- The G‑24 was formed in 1971 against the background of major changes in the international monetary system and intensifying demands by developing countries for a greater voice in global economic governance. Its mandate is deliberately narrow and technical compared with the G‑77: it concentrates on monetary, financial and development finance policy—particularly as these issues are handled in institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
- The group’s mission combines technical coordination (harmonizing policy positions, producing technical input) with political advocacy (presenting a united negotiating front to influence multilateral outcomes).

Institutional relationship with the G‑77
- The G‑24 is institutionally a chapter of the G‑77: every member of the G‑24 is also a member of the G‑77. This relationship allows the G‑77’s broad developmental agenda to be represented in specialised technical fora while enabling the G‑24 to focus on monetary and financial matters where shared technical positions can have leverage.

Functions and activities
- Policy coordination: The G‑24 facilitates sustained consultations among developing countries on monetary and macro‑financial policy positions, lending practices, conditionality and reform of the global financial architecture.
- Representation: It functions as a collective negotiating actor vis‑à‑vis the IMF, World Bank and other multilateral actors, seeking to ensure that the interests and constraints of developing countries are reflected in policy decisions and institutional reforms.
- Technical work and messaging: The group prepares communiqués, technical notes and policy positions for meetings and negotiations, and it seeks to influence discourse on issues such as crisis management, conditionality, sovereign debt treatment and development finance flows.

Membership and observers
- The outline from which this section is drawn lists subheadings for “Member nations” and “Observer nations” but does not provide the specific lists. What is important for analytic purposes is the structure implied: a defined membership of developing states (all of which are G‑77 members) and a category of observers that allows international financial institutions and other organisations to follow and participate in discussions in a limited way.
- In practice, G‑24 meetings frequently include representatives of the IMF and World Bank as observers or interlocutors; these institutions both supply technical input and are the principal audiences for G‑24 positions.

Operational characteristics and gaps in the source text
- The passage does not provide operational details that are often relevant to assessing the group’s influence: the exact member list, rules for chairing and rotation, meeting cadence and decision‑making procedures were not included. These procedural details shape the group’s representativeness and capacity to formulate coherent positions over time.
- The founding date (1971) is provided, a useful anchor: the year coincides with systemic monetary shocks (notably the end of Bretton Woods parities) that help explain why developing countries sought an institutional forum focused on monetary issues.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Political leverage in multilateral finance: For India, engagement with the G‑24 fits naturally within a strategic culture that values multilateral engagement to protect economic sovereignty and to secure development finance on favourable terms. Coordinated positions through the G‑24 amplify India’s leverage in IMF and World Bank negotiations.
- Economic security and crisis management: Monetary and financial rules and practices influence exchange‑rate stability, access to emergency financing, and debt treatment—matters that directly affect India’s macroeconomic stability and thus its national security calculus.
- Coalition building: Participation in a technical, like‑minded coalition such as the G‑24 reflects India’s preference for coalition diplomacy—using groupings of developing countries to shape institutional reform rather than relying solely on bilateral bargaining.
- Policy consistency and signalling: Producing technical communiqués and coordinated positions through the G‑24 allows India to signal commitment to particular development finance reforms (for example, on conditionality or concessional lending) in ways that reinforce its broader strategic priorities.

Implications for analysis
- The G‑24 is best understood as a specialized, technically oriented instrument of collective representation for developing countries within the global financial architecture. Its significance for Indian strategic studies lies less in grand strategy and more in the sober mechanics of how finance shapes state capacity, policy autonomy and resilience—core concerns of national security.
- To evaluate India’s use of the G‑24 as an instrument of policy, additional operational data (membership composition, India’s formal role and statements in G‑24 communiqués, and frequency of India‑led initiatives) should be consulted.

Short concluding note
- The G‑24 exemplifies how developing countries have institutionalised collective technical diplomacy to influence the rules and practices of global finance. For India, the grouping is an instrument for protecting economic interests that, in turn, underpin aspects of national security—making it a relevant, if specialised, subject for a study of India’s strategic culture.
