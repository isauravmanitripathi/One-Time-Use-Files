# The Confederation/Alliance of Sahel States (AES): origins, objectives, constraints, and implications for Indian strategic policy

This section examines the Alliance/Confederation of Sahel States (commonly rendered in sources as the Alliance of Sahel States, the Confederation of Sahel States, or simply AES) — a formalized security‑political grouping formed by Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger in 2023–2024. It synthesizes available descriptive material, highlights major uncertainties, and analyses the AES’s internal dynamics and external alignments with particular attention to how this development intersects with India’s strategic culture and national security interests. Given contested reporting and explicit neutrality disputes surrounding some coverage of the AES, assertions below are identified where verification is required and analytical judgments are framed cautiously.

## Introduction: what the AES purports to be

According to primary reporting summarized in the source notes, the AES originated as a mutual‑defence pact signed on 16 September 2023 in the aftermath of a constitutional crisis in Niger and threats of military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). The three states — Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — subsequently moved to formalize their alignment into a confederation on 6 July 2024. The grouping unites three states currently governed by military juntas and explicitly positions itself against what it calls neo‑colonial influence, adopting an anti‑French and anti‑ECOWAS foreign‑policy posture. The AES articulates an ambitious integration agenda: pooled resources, common infrastructure projects (energy and communications), a common market with free movement of persons, a proposed monetary union and the eventual federalization into a single sovereign polity.

These stated objectives — combining short‑term security cooperation with long‑term political and economic integration — make the AES both an unusual product of recent coups and an aspirational project with profound practical obstacles. Below we unpack origins, policy content, systemic constraints, and strategic consequences.

## Origins and political context

- Trigger and sequence: The AES evolved in two identifiable stages. The first stage was immediate security cooperation following the 2023 Niger crisis and ECOWAS’s threat of intervention (mutual‑defence pact, 16 Sep 2023). The second was constitutional/political formalization (confederation declared 6 Jul 2024). This sequencing points to an initial instrumental security motive that later acquired broader political ambitions.
- Membership and regime type: All three members are Sahel states governed by military juntas that came to power through coups — Mali (coup in 2021), Burkina Faso (Sept 2022), and Niger (2023). The leadership of each state therefore faces both domestic legitimacy gaps and international censure tied to the extra‑constitutional nature of power transfer.
- Political narrative: The AES frames its project as anti‑neo‑colonial and sovereignist. Measures to downgrade French language status or rename colonial street names have been reported as symbolic elements of this ideological stance. This posture dovetails with a broader regional recalibration among some Sahel actors away from former colonial partners.

## Security dynamics

- Security drivers: The immediate impetus for cooperation was mutual protection against perceived external intervention (notably by ECOWAS) and the need to combat transnational jihadist insurgencies that operate across the three countries’ borders.
- Insurgent landscape: The Sahel remains marked by multiple violent non‑state actors — reported groups include an Islamic State affiliate in the region (ambiguous in some reports as “ISSP”), Jama'at Nasr al‑Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), and separatist/rebel movements (e.g., Azawad in northern Mali). These groups operate transnationally, creating incentives for cross‑border security coordination.
- Military partnerships and PMCs: A pivotal security realignment reported in 2024 is the termination of many Western military relationships and the growing employment of Russian private military contractors (notably the Wagner Group). The introduction of PMCs alters battlefield dynamics, accountability norms, and external diplomatic relations — and raises significant human‑rights and legal concerns.

## Economic and integration agenda

- Stated goals: AES proclaims an economic program that ranges from a common market and free movement of persons to shared infrastructure (energy, communications), prioritized investments in agriculture, mining and energy, and an eventual monetary union with a common currency.
- Feasibility considerations: Such ambitions are technically and institutionally demanding. A monetary union, for example, requires deep fiscal coordination, independent central‑bank governance, common payment systems, credible anti‑inflationary institutions, and mechanisms to manage asymmetric shocks among economies of differing size and structure. Transport and customs harmonization, border management, and investment financing are prerequisites for a viable common market.
- Growth versus development: Reported 2024 GDP growth rates (Burkina Faso ~5.5%; Mali ~3.8%; Niger ~9.9%) — with Niger characterized as a fast‑growing economy in 2024 — may reflect commodity booms and specific cycles rather than broad‑based human‑development gains. All three states continue to score low on Human Development Index metrics, a reminder that headline growth does not automatically translate into poverty reduction, public‑service delivery, or institutional resilience.

## Governance, legitimacy, and human‑rights constraints

- Democratic legitimacy: The AES is composed of regimes that seized power by force. Promises to return to civilian rule have been repeatedly delayed, which has domestic and diplomatic costs.
- Human‑rights allegations: International NGOs (e.g., Amnesty International) have accused member governments and security actors of arbitrary arrests, forced disappearances and civilian mass atrocities. Such allegations, if substantiated, impede access to financing, raise the risk of sanctions, and limit partnerships with Western donors or multilateral agencies.
- Domestic contestation: Federalizing three states governed by juntas is inherently fraught; local, ethnic, and regional actors may resist transfers of sovereignty, particularly in politically fragmented or conflicted zones (e.g., northern Mali).

## Geopolitical realignment and external consequences

- Anti‑Western pivot and Russian deepening: The AES’s severing of key military ties with Western partners and its engagement with Russian military actors marks a major geopolitical pivot in the Sahel. This shift amplifies Russia’s footprint in Africa, complicates European and ECOWAS policy levers, and intensifies global great‑power competition on the continent.
- Diplomatic fallout: Reported expulsions of Western ambassadors (e.g., Sweden) and other diplomatic breakdowns narrow channels for mediation, aid negotiations, and crisis management.
- Risks of isolation and sanctions: A confederation formed by coup regimes may confront suspension from regional bodies, withholding of development finance, and targeted sanctions — all of which would constrain the AES’s ability to finance integration projects and stabilize economies.

## Practical constraints on AES integration

- Financing and technical capacity: Large infrastructure and monetary projects require external finance, technology transfer and institutional capacity that may be limited given diplomatic isolation and risk perceptions among investors.
- Security paradox: While the confederation is intended to manage transnational threats, porous borders and integrated insurgent networks risk making insecurity regional rather than national — cooperation may help, but may also facilitate cross‑border spillovers if not effectively managed.
- Institutional depth: Successful integration depends on bureaucratic coordination, legal harmonization, and trusted dispute‑resolution mechanisms — all hard to build under militarized, transitional governance.

## Implications for Indian strategic culture and policy

Why should India’s strategic elite care about the AES? The answer lies in three intersecting strands: India’s expanding engagement with Africa, the global struggle over influence in the continent, and transnational security and development linkages that can affect India’s interests.

1. Strategic posture and principle: India’s strategic culture emphasizes sovereignty, non‑interference and support for African agency — but also values democratic norms and multilateralism. The AES poses a tension between these principles: engaging could be framed as respect for sovereign choices, whereas entering close relations risks appearing to legitimise regimes that came to power through coups and that may be implicated in human‑rights abuses.

2. Great‑power competition and Russia: The AES’s embrace of Russian security actors (and rejection of Western military partners) dovetails with India’s long‑standing strategic partnership with Russia. This creates a pragmatic opening for Indian defence diplomacy — but the Wagner model also carries reputational and legal risks. India must weigh potential benefits of enhanced access to raw materials and security cooperation against the risks of association with private military contractors implicated in abuses and with policies that isolate regimes from mainstream international institutions.

3. Economic interests: The AES members have significant natural‑resource endowments (minerals, agricultural potential, energy). India's need for diversified resource sources and markets could generate interest in mining, energy and agrarian investments. However, investor risk is high: political instability, sanctions risk, weak rule‑of‑law and infrastructure gaps complicate private investment calculations. Moreover, headline GDP growth figures — particularly in commodity‑driven economies — do not guarantee stable long‑term returns.

4. Counterterrorism and security cooperation: India’s core security concerns derive primarily from its near abroad and the Indo‑Pacific. Yet the transnational nature of jihadist networks, global terrorism financing and the potential for mercenary warfare to spill into regional instability can indirectly affect India’s security environment (e.g., via international terrorism networks, mercenary proliferation or political shocks affecting international markets). India has capabilities in capacity building, intelligence sharing, and training for counter‑insurgency that could be offered multilaterally (e.g., under UN or AU frameworks), but direct bilateral cooperation with AES members is complicated by legitimacy and human‑rights considerations.

5. Diplomatic balancing: India maintains strong relations with France and growing partnerships with the EU and West Africa. The AES’s anti‑French posture complicates Indian diplomacy: India seeks to avoid transactional alignments that could jeopardize its broader European relationships or its role as a responsible partner in multilateral institutions. Simultaneously, India’s desire to expand Africa ties and counterbalance other external actors (notably China) suggests a calibrated engagement strategy.

## Policy options for India — calibrated engagement

Given the structural risks and strategic opportunities, Indian policy responses should be cautious, principled and pragmatic. Key options include:

- Conditioned pragmatic engagement: Continue to engage on non‑controversial development fronts (health, agriculture, capacity building) through multilateral channels and Indian development agencies, while avoiding high‑visibility security agreements that could signal endorsement of military rule.
- Multilateral and normative posture: Work through multilateral institutions (UN, AU, ECOWAS) to support conflict resolution, humanitarian assistance and institution‑building. India can emphasize capacity building for governance and civilian institutions as preconditions for deeper economic ties.
- Targeted economic diplomacy: Encourage Indian private sector interest in extractives and infrastructure but require rigorous due diligence on legal, human‑rights and sanctions risks. Use development finance (lines of credit through EXIM Bank, concessional assistance) with strict compliance safeguards.
- Counterterrorism and law‑enforcement cooperation: Where possible, support partner states’ capacities through UN or AU missions and training programs that emphasize adherence to international humanitarian and human‑rights standards.
- Strategic balancing with European partners: Coordinate with EU, France and regional organizations to avoid unilateralism and to preserve broader partnerships in Africa, while protecting India’s independent diplomatic footprint.
- Monitor and hedge: Keep diplomatic and economic options open, closely monitor human‑rights developments and the operational footprint of PMCs, and prepare contingency plans for sanctions and market disruptions.

## Conclusion — limited ambitions in a high‑risk environment

The AES is a high‑ambition project born in crisis: a security pact that aspires to deep political and economic integration among three coup‑led Sahel states. Its trajectory will depend on the ability to stabilize security, secure external financing and technical capacities, and manage acute legitimacy deficits before domestic and international audiences. For India, the AES presents both opportunities (resource access, new partnerships, alignment with a partner of strategic symmetry in Russia) and risks (reputational exposure, sanctions, entanglement in human‑rights controversies). India’s strategic culture — a synthesis of non‑interference, principled multilateralism, and pragmatic statecraft — argues for measured, multilateral engagement that prioritizes rule‑of‑law, development, and human‑security outcomes while preserving Indian interests.

## Notes on sources, verification and outstanding uncertainties

The material summarized above is drawn from a compiled source brief that flagged a neutrality dispute (date noted August 2025) and includes specific claims requiring independent confirmation. Researchers and policymakers should verify:

- The precise dates and legal form of the mutual‑defence pact (16 Sep 2023) and the confederation declaration (6 Jul 2024) via primary government releases and ECOWAS/AU communiqués.
- Macroeconomic figures (2024 GDP growth rates) with IMF, World Bank and national statistical office data and check methodologies.
- The identity and operational scope of insurgent groups referenced generically as “ISSP” and corroborate with security‑intelligence reporting.
- The legal and operational status of Russian private military contractors (e.g., Wagner Group) and any formal agreements with the AES states.
- Human‑rights allegations cited by NGOs (Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch) through their detailed reports and corroborating independent investigations.
- Reactions and measures taken by ECOWAS, the African Union, the EU and other key actors toward the confederation; and whether sanctions, suspensions or aid restrictions have been imposed.

A careful, measured research agenda — combining primary documents, multilateral institution records, NGO field reports and economic datasets — is essential for robust analytic and policy judgments concerning the AES and its implications for India.

## Regional insurgencies and successive coups in the Sahel: context for the Alliance of Sahel States

This section examines the intertwined phenomena of long‑running jihadist insurgency and a cascade of military coups across the Sahel, and explains how those dynamics produced new, junta‑led initiatives such as the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). While rooted in local histories of state weakness and armed mobilization, these developments have produced regional institutional ruptures, humanitarian crises, and shifting external alignments. For readers interested in Indian strategic culture and national security policy, the Sahel case is instructive: it highlights how protracted insecurity, institutional erosion, and changing external patronage can reshape regional order and create policy dilemmas for distant external powers that prize sovereignty, multilateralism and stable partnerships.

1. The insurgency as a deep structural driver
- The Sahel’s contemporary security environment has been shaped by a jihadist insurgency that intensified from the early 2000s and radiated widely after 2012. Multiple armed networks — locally rooted and transnationally connected — operate across porous borders. Key manifestations include the Mali War (post‑2012 insurgency and counter‑insurgency), and the Boko Haram/ISWAP conflict in the Lake Chad Basin.
- Jihadist presence is geographically dispersed and tactically adaptive; by mid‑2021 groups such as Islamic State’s Sahel Province controlled or contested territory in several parts of the central Sahel, enabling coercion, taxation and recruitment.
- The insurgency has not only caused direct violence against civilians and security forces but also hollowed state presence, disrupted services, and eroded popular confidence in civilian governance — conditions that increase the risk of military intervention and localized violent bargaining.

2. The cascade of coups: chronology and patterns
- Between 2020 and 2023 a series of coups overturned elected or transitional governments in multiple Sahel states, reshaping political alignments:
  - Mali: In August 2020 the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP), led by Colonel Assimi Goïta, deposed President Ibrahim Boubacar Keïta. A second, internal junta consolidation occurred in May 2021 when Goïta removed the interim president and prime minister, entrenching military control.
  - Burkina Faso: Two coups in 2022. In January, Paul‑Henri Sandaogo Damiba removed President Roch Marc Christian Kaboré; by September a factional coup ousted Damiba and brought Captain Ibrahim Traoré to power.
  - Niger: In July 2023 the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland removed President Mohamed Bazoum and installed General Abdourahamane Tchiani as head of a junta.
  - Guinea (not a member of AES): In September 2021 Mamady Doumbouya’s National Committee of Reconciliation and Development seized power from Alpha Condé. Although not an AES member state, Guinea’s junta has been an interlocutor and sympathetic actor in the wider regional junta milieu.
- These events are often grouped conceptually as the “Coup Belt”: a linked regional phenomenon whereby neighboring or contiguous states experienced successive military takeovers, undermining regional democratic norms and the authority of civilian regional institutions.

3. Institutional rupture: the collapse of the G5 Sahel and the rise of ad hoc junta cooperation
- G5 Sahel, established in 2014 (Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso, Chad, Mauritania), was intended to coordinate development and joint security responses, and it became the principal internationally backed vehicle for counter‑insurgency cooperation in the central Sahel.
- The coup wave precipitated withdrawals from G5 Sahel by junta‑led states: Mali departed in 2022; Burkina Faso and Niger left in 2023. With only Chad and Mauritania remaining, the framework was effectively dissolved shortly thereafter.
- The dissolution of this multilateral, internationally supported mechanism removed a recognized institutional platform for coordinated action and international cooperation in the region. The vacuum encouraged new, less‑institutionalized arrangements, notably the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), an ad hoc grouping of junta governments created to provide mutual political and security support and to blunt diplomatic isolation.

4. The Alliance of Sahel States: purpose, composition and legitimacy questions
- AES can be understood as a defensive and diplomatic response by junta governments to international pressure, sanctions, and the loss of traditional partners. Its stated aims include mutual defense, coordination against external intervention, and assertion of sovereign choice in security partnerships.
- The alliance’s membership, motivations and practices signal a shift from multilateral, internationally backed security architectures to close‑knit, regime‑preserving cooperation among military rulers. Its international legitimacy is fragile: AES members face suspensions from regional bodies (ECOWAS, AU), potential sanctions and limited recognition from many democratic governments.
- The practical effectiveness of AES remains uncertain. While it can provide short‑term political solidarity and facilitate material or logistical cooperation, it lacks the institutional depth, external legitimacy, and integrated resources that the G5 had or that international partnerships had previously provided.

5. Interaction between insurgency and coups: causation, correlation and feedbacks
- There is robust evidence of mutual reinforcement between persistent insurgency and the coups: prolonged violence degraded governance capacity, undercut legitimacy, and provided a rationale for military actors to claim the necessity of seizing power to restore security.
- Conversely, military rule has at times weakened broader counter‑insurgency effectiveness through politicization of security services, isolation from international intelligence and logistical support, and unpredictable domestic politics (including factionalism and countercoups).
- Analysts must be careful to distinguish correlation from causation: while insurgency created enabling conditions for coups, other factors (elite competition, economic stress, weak institutions) also contributed to the political breakdowns.

6. Humanitarian, security and economic consequences
- Humanitarian impact: Mass displacement, civilian casualties, food insecurity, and disruption of basic services have multiplied across Sahel countries, driven by both jihadist violence and military governance transitions.
- Security fragmentation: The multiplicity of armed actors — jihadist networks, state militaries controlled by different juntas, and local militias — increases the likelihood of protracted, multi‑actor conflicts and cross‑border spillovers.
- Economic effects: Reduced foreign investment, donor retrenchment, targeted sanctions, and declining state capacity constrain public spending and development programs, thereby deepening cycles of deprivation that insurgents exploit.

7. External actors, new patrons and the reconfiguration of influence
- As Western countries (notably France) reduced force presence and partnerships, several Sahelese juntas sought alternative external partners and means of security support. Reports indicate growing ties between some junta regimes and Russian actors, including private military companies (PMCs), as well as outreach to other non‑Western states.
- These shifts produce strategic competition in influence, access to resources, and military logistics. PMCs can provide rapid operational capacity but raise questions of control, accountability and long‑term sustainability.
- For the international community, the newer patronage networks challenge normative responses (condemnation, sanctions) and complicate efforts to restore multilateral cooperation.

8. Regional security architecture and policy implications
- The collapse of G5 Sahel and the emergence of AES mark a significant institutional transformation. Without a coordinated, internationally backed counter‑insurgency mechanism, coherent regional responses to jihadist threats are more difficult to organize and sustain.
- This fragmentation raises key risks: escalation between regional blocs (e.g., ECOWAS) and juntas, diminished intelligence and logistic interoperability, and increased opportunities for insurgents to exploit gaps.
- Policy options at the regional and global levels are constrained by normative commitments to constitutional order, the practical need to combat terrorism, and the diplomatic imperative of protecting civilians.

9. Monitoring priorities for analysts
- Track transition plans and timelines for elections or return to civilian rule; junta cohesion and risk of countercoups; territorial control and movements of jihadist groups; humanitarian indicators (displacement, food security); and the presence and terms of foreign military/logistical partnerships.
- Analytic practice should map the timing of political transitions, foreign military withdrawals or arrivals (including PMCs), and shifts in insurgent activity to assess causal linkages rather than treating events in isolation.

10. Policy implications for India: considerations in light of Indian strategic culture
India’s strategic culture emphasizes sovereignty, non‑intervention, support for multilateralism, and steady long‑term partnerships oriented toward development and capacity‑building. These predispositions inform pragmatic policy options in responding to Sahel instability:

- Principles and posture
  - Uphold normative commitment to constitutional order and multilateral processes (AU, UN, ECOWAS) while recognizing the practical need to mitigate humanitarian suffering and transnational threats.
  - Avoid overt alignment with junta governments’ political legitimacy claims, but preserve space for issue‑based engagement (humanitarian assistance, health, development) that benefits civilians.

- Multilateral engagement
  - Support and work through multilateral institutions (UN, African Union) to sustain humanitarian operations, peacekeeping where mandated, and political mediation efforts.
  - Contribute to multilateral intelligence‑sharing platforms and UN stabilization mandates that focus on protection of civilians and rule‑of‑law capacity building.

- Security cooperation and capacity building
  - Prioritize non‑combat capacity building: training in counter‑terrorism policing (civilian law enforcement), border management, disaster response, police reform and judicial strengthening. These are consistent with India’s preference for long‑term institutional assistance rather than direct combat deployments.
  - Provide selective maritime and airlift support if requested through legitimate multilateral channels to improve logistics for humanitarian operations.
  - Exercise caution about direct military engagement with junta forces that lack broad international legitimacy; if engagement occurs, it should be conditioned on clear, verifiable commitments to human rights and civilian protection.

- Humanitarian and development assistance
  - Scale up humanitarian assistance targeted at displaced populations, food security and public health — areas where Indian assistance can have tangible impact and retain principled distance from political controversies.
  - Invest in development projects that rebuild governance capacity (education, health systems, infrastructure) and reduce long‑term drivers of radicalization.

- Diplomatic balance and strategic hedging
  - Maintain open diplomatic channels with all de facto authorities to protect Indian nationals and commercial interests while simultaneously advocating for a return to constitutional processes.
  - Watch carefully for the involvement of private military companies and external patrons whose activities may destabilize the enforcement of law and complicate India’s position; avoid operational or financial entanglements with entities that lack legal status or accountability.

- Economic and consular considerations
  - Protect commercial and energy interests, diversify supply and investment strategies to mitigate risks from regional instability.
  - Strengthen consular support and evacuation planning for Indian nationals amid episodic violence and political upheaval.

11. Concluding assessment
The Sahel’s trajectory since 2020 — persistent jihadist violence coupled with a chain of coups and the collapse of previous regional security mechanisms — has produced a reconfigured regional order. The AES epitomizes a junta‑centred attempt at mutual protection and diplomatic insulation but lacks the institutional depth and international legitimacy of prior frameworks such as the G5 Sahel. For external actors like India, policy must reconcile normative commitments (support for constitutionalism and multilateralism) with pragmatic interests (citizens’ safety, counter‑terrorism cooperation, development). India’s strategic culture suggests avenues of impactful engagement: principled multilateralism, civilian‑focused capacity building, humanitarian assistance, and calibrated diplomatic outreach — measures that can help mitigate instability while preserving normative consistency and long‑term partnerships.

Annex: Short checklist for analysts and policymakers
- Track: election timetables, junta internal coherence, jihadist territorial control, humanitarian metrics, foreign military/logistics arrivals (state or PMC), sanctions or suspensions by AU/ECOWAS.
- Policy triggers: credible transitional timetable; deterioration in humanitarian indicators; requests for UN/AU assistance; overt expansion of external military actors (risk to regional stability).
- Guidance for India: prioritize multilateral channels, civilian capacity building, humanitarian assistance, careful diplomatic engagement, avoid entangling security contracts with illegitimate actors.

Section: The Alliance of Sahel States, ECOWAS, and Lessons for India’s Strategic Culture

Introduction

The crisis between the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) — composed of the juntas that seized power in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger — and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) offers a salient case study for scholars of regional ordering, collective security, and the interplay between norm enforcement and realpolitik. Although geographically distant from India, the episode touches on themes central to India’s strategic culture and national security policy: the efficacy of regional organizations in enforcing constitutional norms, the emergence of counter-blocs that contest regional authority, the securitization of natural resources, and the role of external partners in shaping regional outcomes. This section synthesizes the key events and stakes of the AES–ECOWAS confrontation, assesses its implications for regional order, and draws operational lessons for India’s external security and diplomatic strategy.

Executive summary of the episode

- After coups in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, ECOWAS suspended the three states for unconstitutional changes of government and threatened collective measures, including the use of force, to restore constitutional order — notably in Niger after President Mohamed Bazoum’s removal.
- Mali and Burkina Faso pledged military support to Niger; Guinea provided diplomatic backing. Those mutual defense assurances catalyzed the formalization of the Alliance of Sahel States as a mutual-defense bloc.
- The AES’s existence and commitments appeared to deter, or at least frustrate, an immediate ECOWAS military intervention in Niger.
- Civil-society voices such as the West Africa Peoples Organisation criticized interventionist rhetoric, framing it as pretextual and tied to Niger’s mineral and hydrocarbon wealth.
- On 28 January 2024 the three countries announced a joint withdrawal from ECOWAS. ECOWAS later appointed three mediators and on 15 December 2024 set an exit transition period (29 January–29 July 2025) for the three states; the AES rejected that extension and insists on completing withdrawal by January 2025.
- The situation remains a diplomatic and security impasse: mediation is ongoing but substantive resolution is lacking, leaving open significant risks to regional security, economics, and governance norms.

Chronology and mechanics of the confrontation

- Coup(s) in the Sahel (Mali and Burkina Faso earlier; Niger’s coup that removed President Mohamed Bazoum was the proximate trigger) → ECOWAS invokes its protocols against unconstitutional change and moves to sanction and, if necessary, coerce restoration.
- The threatened coercive response prompted immediate pledges of inter-junta military assistance and diplomatic solidarity, which were institutionalized as the Alliance of Sahel States.
- 28 January 2024: joint announcement of withdrawal from ECOWAS by AES members.
- 2024 (later): ECOWAS appoints mediators to engage the AES; diplomacy becomes the preferred public strategy even as deadlines and postures harden.
- 15 December 2024: ECOWAS Conference of Heads of State sets an exit transition period for the AES members; the AES rejects the timetable, preserving a legal and political standoff.

Actors, motives and narratives

Primary stakeholders
- AES members: military governments in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger (jointly framing their alliance as defensive and sovereign).
- ECOWAS: the regional organization tasked with upholding democratic norms, which possesses protocols (including sanctions and collective action measures) against unconstitutional change.
- President Mohamed Bazoum: the deposed Nigerien leader and focal point of ECOWAS’s proposed coercive restoration.
- Allied/adjacent states and actors: Guinea (diplomatic support), civil-society groups (e.g., West Africa Peoples Organisation), and external powers and private actors with political, security, or resource interests in the Sahel.

Motives and framing
- AES members justified mutual defense as deterrence against external military intervention and as an assertion of sovereignty against what they portray as neo‑imperial designs — a narrative amplified by references to Niger’s uranium and hydrocarbons.
- ECOWAS invoked its rules to preserve democratic norms and regional order; the threat of force was framed as enforcement of community protocols rather than aggression.
- Civil-society and political group critiques highlight longstanding suspicions about resource-driven intervention by external powers, thus adding a normative counterargument to ECOWAS’s security framing.

Norms, legalities and institutional responses

- ECOWAS has explicit protocols against unconstitutional changes of government and an institutional history of sanctions, suspension, and — in exceptional cases — collective security measures. These are instruments meant to enforce regional norms and protect constitutionalism.
- AES membership and formal withdrawal present a legal and institutional challenge: when member states coalesce to blunt enforcement mechanisms, the normative authority of the regional organization is weakened.
- The AES–ECOWAS impasse underscores the limits of supranational enforcement when powerful domestic actors (security forces) and cross-border military pacts countervail institutional coercion.

The role of natural resources and the imperialism narrative

- Resource endowments in Niger (notably uranium and hydrocarbon potential) are central to the contested narratives. They are cited by critics of intervention as motives for external interference and by regional actors as strategic assets making Niger a site of geopolitical competition.
- Whether or not resource motives are decisive, the perception of resource-driven politics shapes local and regional support for anti‑interventionist stances and can attract external partners willing to exploit the schism.

Mediation, diplomatic standoff and current status

- ECOWAS’s appointment of mediators signals a recalibration toward negotiated outcomes, reflecting the political and military costs of coercion and the deterrent effect of AES mutual defense arrangements.
- The December 2024 adoption of an exit transition timeline by ECOWAS represented an attempt to normalize an orderly withdrawal; the AES’s rejection demonstrates the mistrust that characterizes the negotiations and the difficulty of reconciling competing timetables and legal interpretations.
- The stalemate produces a protracted, low‑intensity diplomatic crisis: neither side has (publicly) secured a decisive advantage, and the risk of miscalculation remains.

Implications and risks for regional order

- Erosion of normative enforcement: If member states can effectively resist ECOWAS sanctions or coercion by forming counter‑regional blocs, ECOWAS’s capacity to deter coups is weakened, posing a precedent for future unconstitutional changes.
- Polarization and fragmentation: AES–ECOWAS polarization could deepen fault lines within West Africa, complicating cooperative security initiatives such as counter‑terrorism and transnational policing.
- Security vacuum and escalation risks: Prolonged diplomatic stalemate may enable insurgent groups, create cross‑border instability, or open the door to intervention by external powers seeking influence, security contracts, or access to resources.
- Economic dislocation: Suspension and withdrawal from ECOWAS can disrupt trade, movement of people, financial flows, and cooperative development programs, with humanitarian consequences for vulnerable populations.
- External competition: A contested Sahel increases opportunity costs and incentive for non‑Western external actors (states, private military companies) to deepen presence, heightening the complexity of local security dilemmas.

Lessons and implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Why this Sahel episode matters to India
Though India is not a proximate actor in West Africa in structural terms, the AES–ECOWAS case resonates with several core elements of India’s strategic culture:
- Norms vs. interests: India’s longstanding emphasis on sovereignty and non‑interference must be reconciled with support for democratic norms and regional stability where Indian interests are at stake.
- Multipolar engagement: The crisis illustrates how regional fragmentation creates openings for external actors; India’s growing global interests (investment, energy, diaspora protection) require calibrated approaches when regional order is contested.
- Protection of economic assets and citizens abroad: Confrontations that threaten access to resources, projects, or the security of Indian nationals demand contingency planning.
- Multilateralism and regional institutions: The limits of regional organizations to enforce norms are instructive for how India views and engages with similar institutions (e.g., SAARC, BIMSTEC) and the utility of bilateral vs. multilateral instruments.

Operational policy implications for India
- Diversified diplomatic posture: India should maintain principled support for constitutional order while preserving channels with all relevant actors in crisis states to protect strategic and commercial interests.
- Preventive diplomacy and capacity building: India can invest in conflict‑prevention and institution‑building (training, governance assistance, judicial and electoral support) with regional organizations to strengthen normative resilience and create networks of influence that favor stability.
- Strategic hedging: In contexts where regional orders are contested, India may need to hedge — safeguarding its economic and security interests through contingency logistics, evacuation plans for citizens, and diversified sourcing of critical supplies.
- Careful engagement with external power competition: India should be mindful in aligning with either side of local disputes in regions where other great-power competitors are active; transparent principles and calibrated support can minimize reputational and strategic risk.
- Economic and infrastructure resilience: Mitigate exposure by ensuring Indian investments in fragile regions are risk‑assessed, insured where possible, and supported by diplomatic and security contingency arrangements.

Policy recommendations (concise)
- Advocate principled multilateralism: Continue public support for regional institutions’ legitimacy while urging negotiated solutions that prioritize civilian protection and rule of law.
- Expand preventive engagement: Offer technical assistance and capacity building to regional bodies and civil society to reduce drivers of coup susceptibility (governance deficits, resource mismanagement).
- Institutionalize contingency planning: Establish interagency plans for evacuation, asset protection, and continuity of business operations for Indian entities in volatile regions.
- Monitor external actor involvement: Track the roles of foreign state and non‑state security providers (including PMCs), and calibrate India’s diplomatic posture to avoid entanglement while protecting national interests.
- Leverage soft‑power and development diplomacy: Use development projects and people‑to‑people ties to maintain influence regardless of regime changes, while adhering to India’s principles on sovereignty.

Questions for follow‑up and monitoring (research agenda)

- What are the AES’s formal treaty texts, command arrangements, and legal commitments? How institutionalized is the alliance beyond declaratory mutual defense?
- Which external states, security providers, or private military companies are engaging with AES members, and what are the terms (training, bases, contracts, resource agreements)?
- What specific measures has ECOWAS implemented (sanctions, border controls, finance restrictions), and how effective have these been economically and politically?
- How is exclusion from ECOWAS affecting ordinary citizens and economic sectors (trade, migration, remittances, health and education cooperation) in the three states?
- What is the precise mandate and progress of the mediators appointed by ECOWAS? Are there confidence‑building measures or draft compromises on timelines and transitional governance?
- If AES members adhere to a January 2025 withdrawal, what are the legal steps and operational contingencies that will follow — and how will ECOWAS and third parties respond?

Conclusion

The AES–ECOWAS impasse illustrates the fragility of regional normative orders when confronted with determined material and political resistance. For India, the episode is a timely reminder that principled support for regional institutions must be matched by pragmatic mechanisms for protecting national interests and contributing to stability. India’s strategic culture — which prizes sovereignty, non‑alignment, and multilateral engagement — is well positioned to offer a calibrated mix of diplomatic mediation, capacity building, and contingency planning. The central challenge is operational: to translate norms into durable influence without becoming ensnared in external power competition or inadvertently empowering actors whose trajectories contravene democratic accountability and long‑term regional stability.

### Case Study: The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) — Formation, Design, and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Overview
- In mid‑2024 the three Sahelian states of Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger moved rapidly from a mutual‑defence compact to a formalized confederation. A draft text finalizing the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) was completed in May 2024 in Niamey; by July 2024 the leaders had signed a confederation treaty and published a 25‑point communique. The move institutionalizes deeper cooperation, with explicit emphasis on collective security. This episode is useful to examine as a contemporary example of small‑state security cooperation, the politics of confederation as an institutional choice, and the ways such regional arrangements interact with external powers — all points with bearing on India’s strategic culture and policy calculus.

1. Timeline and immediate purpose
- May–July 2024 compressed process:
  - May 2024: delegates from the three countries finalized a draft establishing the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). The draft’s stated purpose was technical: to prepare a text for signature.
  - July 2024: heads of state signed the confederation treaty in Niamey; a 25‑point communique summarised agreed positions and commitments.
- Interpretation: the short interval from draft to signature indicates political urgency and momentum among the regimes involved. The architecture was less an exercise in prolonged multilateral bargaining and more a deliberate, expedited consolidation of military and political cooperation.

2. Stated aim and political logic
- The declared purpose of the treaty is to strengthen an existing mutual‑defence pact. Concretely, that implies elevation from episodic or limited security cooperation to a standing, treaty‑level framework for collective security.
- Underlying objectives likely include:
  - Coordinated defence against jihadist insurgencies and other non‑state threats;
  - Deterrence against perceived external intervention or coercion and signalling of political solidarity between the regimes;
  - Institutionalising cooperation to secure internal regime survival as much as to address cross‑border security challenges.

3. Governance architecture: confederation and rotating presidency
- Confederation choice: the AES is explicitly a confederation rather than a federation. That institutional choice prioritises state sovereignty — coordination on selected domains without political integration or loss of decision‑making autonomy.
- Rotating one‑year presidency:
  - The treaty establishes a one‑year rotating presidency among member leaders; operationally, the sitting head of state chairs the presidency.
  - Assimi Goïta, Mali’s interim leader, assumed the first rotation on signature day.
- Analytical implications:
  - Parity: rotation aims to balance influence and symbolically respect sovereignty.
  - Continuity problem: short rotations can fragment strategic continuity and make long‑term planning or implementation of multi‑year projects difficult, particularly for defence planning and institution‑building.
  - Political signalling: the choice of the chair for the initial term (Mali’s junta leader) signals the character of leadership within the AES and may reflect the relative standing of internal regimes rather than neutral technocratic selection.

4. Institutional development: parliamentary summit and legitimacy
- The agreement to hold a first joint parliamentary summit in Burkina Faso signals an intent to create consultative or parliamentary organs. Such bodies are typically deployed to confer internal legitimacy and create civilian oversight or fora for political coordination.
- Yet a summit, by itself, does not equate to durable legislative integration or robust checks. Its practical impact depends on subsequent follow‑up: permanency of parliamentary organs, legal competences granted, and pathways for domestic ratification.

5. The 25‑point communique: scope and uncertainty
- The communique accompanies the treaty and likely enumerates security, political and possibly economic commitments. However, absent the full published text, the scope, specificity and binding force of those points remain unclear.
- Key unknowns include: rules of engagement, command arrangements, budgetary commitments, intelligence‑sharing protocols, dispute resolution mechanisms, and the legal status of joint forces or bases.

6. Operational and legal gaps that require clarification
- For a confederation premised on defence cooperation to be operational, several technical elements must be resolved:
  - Force structure and doctrine: Will there be a joint rapid reaction force? How will units be composed and financed?
  - Command and control: What chain of command, legal orders and authority will govern cross‑border operations?
  - Financing: Who pays for common capabilities, and how are costs apportioned?
  - Ratification and domestic legality: Does the treaty require parliamentary approval in each member state? What constitutional processes apply?
  - External legal relations: How will AES treaty commitments interact with existing bilateral agreements and regional obligations (e.g., ECOWAS, AU, UN mandates)?
- The treaty’s effectiveness depends heavily on resolving these practical questions.

7. Regional and international implications
- Relations with regional bodies and external powers:
  - ECOWAS and the African Union: AES creates a parallel security aggregation that could compete with or undermine ECOWAS efforts. It raises questions about coherence in regional responses to crises (e.g., coups, humanitarian disasters, insurgencies).
  - Western partners and former colonial powers: The AES’s emphasis on sovereignty and consolidation of junta‑led governments risks friction with actors (EU, France) that have sought to influence outcomes in the Sahel through military and development assistance.
  - Alternative partnerships: The AES may seek other security partners or suppliers (private military companies, non‑Western states) to offset reduced Western cooperation.
- Broader norm effects:
  - The confederation underscores a trend where states under political strain formalize arrangements to protect regime interests and territorial sovereignty, which can complicate multilateral counterterrorism operations and humanitarian access.

8. Risks and potential downsides
- Isolation and sanctions: Greater institutional alignment among regimes that have faced international censure could deepen their diplomatic isolation and invite targeted sanctions.
- Fragmentation of counterterrorism efforts: Divergent approaches between AES and other regional or international actors could reduce operational coherence in counter‑insurgency campaigns.
- Internal legitimacy: If confederation primarily serves regime security rather than public welfare, it may exacerbate domestic grievances and hinder long‑term stability.
- Escalation dynamics: Posturing or military coordination intended as deterrence can provoke regional rivalries or miscalculation if neighbouring states feel threatened.

9. Why the AES matters for India — connecting to India’s strategic culture
- India’s strategic culture emphasises sovereignty, non‑interference, and multilateralism, balanced with pragmatic pursuit of security and economic interests. The AES episode intersects several aspects of that culture and has tangible policy implications:
  - Preference for multilateral, rules‑based engagement: India generally supports continental or UN‑led frameworks. A new confederation operating outside established regional bodies may complicate India’s choices on recognition, cooperation and speaking with one voice through multilateral institutions.
  - Respect for sovereignty vs. counterterrorism imperatives: India has experienced domestic terrorism and places importance on capability building and intelligence cooperation. AES’s focus on sovereignty resonates with India’s own emphases, but operational opacity could hinder India’s ability to cooperate effectively on counterterrorism and humanitarian issues.
  - Diversified partnerships and strategic autonomy: India seeks to maintain independent ties with multiple partners, including African states. The AES trend toward alternative security partners (e.g., non‑Western suppliers) could open new avenues for India, but also put Delhi in a delicate position vis‑à‑vis Western partners and established multilateral mechanisms.
  - Normative posture: India’s global messaging often stresses constitutionalism and democratic norms. AES’s association with junta governments poses a reputational question — how to engage without appearing to condone anti‑constitutional changes while protecting bilateral interests.

10. Policy implications and recommendations for Indian policymakers
- Monitor closely and acquire texts: India should obtain the full treaty and communique to assess legal obligations, defence arrangements and operational implications.
- Engage multilaterally: Work through the UN, African Union and ECOWAS channels to support conflict resolution, humanitarian access and coordinated counterterrorism strategies, while discouraging further fragmentation.
- Calibrate bilateral engagement:
  - Preserve pragmatic engagement in development, trade, and capacity building (e.g., training, healthcare, infrastructure), which aligns with India’s soft‑power approach.
  - Avoid overt military alignment that could compromise India’s broader strategic partnerships or imply endorsement of unconstitutional regime change.
- Prepare contingency planning:
  - Secure lines of communication with Indian nationals, firms and projects in the Sahel;
  - Assess implications for energy and minerals supply chains (should AES pursue independent resource deals).
- Offer niche cooperation:
  - India can contribute to civilian capacity‑building (police training, rule‑of‑law programs, cybersecurity, disaster response) that addresses root causes of instability without becoming entangled in heavy militarised support.
- Preserve strategic autonomy:
  - Use flexible diplomatic engagement — engage with AES as a regional actor where doing so advances Indian interests, while continuing constructive relations with other regional stakeholders and external partners.

11. Concluding observations and monitoring checklist
- The AES formation represents accelerated institutionalisation of defence cooperation among three Sahel states, designed to preserve sovereignty while producing collective security benefits. Its confederation model, rapid timeline and leadership choices indicate a politically driven project with regime‑security priorities.
- For India, the AES is both an emblematic case of how regional security architecture is evolving and a set of concrete policy challenges: balancing normative commitments with pragmatic interests; maintaining multilateral engagement while preserving strategic autonomy; and preparing for operational contingencies affecting Indian citizens and investments.
- Immediate items for continued monitoring:
  - Full treaty text and the 25‑point communique;
  - Domestic ratification processes and constitutional reviews in member states;
  - Creation and mandate of AES institutions (defence command, parliamentary organs);
  - Announcements on force composition, financing and foreign security partnerships;
  - Reactions from ECOWAS, AU, UN, EU and major external powers;
  - Any shifts in bilateral agreements relevant to Indian economic or citizens’ interests.

This case underscores a persistent lesson for Indian strategic policy: regional institutional innovation—especially when driven by security exigencies and political imperatives—affects strategic opportunity structures. A prudent Indian approach combines careful legal and political analysis, multilateral engagement, and selective bilateral initiatives that protect India’s interests while respecting the principles central to its strategic culture.

## Chapter X: The Sahel Realignment — ECOWAS, the Alliance of Sahel States, and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

### Introduction
On 29 January 2025, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger — three founding members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) — formally withdrew from the organisation, completing a one-year notice period required under ECOWAS's legal framework. The three states immediately took several measures to consolidate their exit: circulation of new Alliance of Sahel States (AES) passports and the announcement of a planned unified military unit of 5,000 troops to operate within AES territory. ECOWAS, in turn, issued an interim position to minimise disruption: it will continue to recognise ECOWAS-branded travel documents from the three states and maintain visa‑free movement, residence, and establishment rights as well as trade treatment under the ECOWAS Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS) and existing investment policies “until further notice.”

The rupture removes roughly 76 million people from ECOWAS’s aggregate population (from an original 446 million) and substantially reduces its territorial footprint — the AES collective territory (2,781,392 km2) is now larger than the adjusted ECOWAS territory (2,087,596 km2). The withdrawal of three founding members carries immediate legal, security, economic, and diplomatic consequences. For Indian strategic planners and scholars of India’s strategic culture, the episode offers a useful case study in regional institutional fragmentation, questions of sovereignty and recognition, and the external implications of intra-African realignments for India’s long-term security and economic interests.

This section analyses the withdrawal’s factual matrix and consequences, then draws out implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy, concluding with policy options and a watchlist for ongoing monitoring.

### Factual matrix: what happened and how
- Date and procedure: On 29 January 2025, Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger invoked formal withdrawal provisions after giving a one-year notice. The observance of the notice period suggests procedural compliance with ECOWAS’s treaty exit rules, reducing immediate legal grounds for contestation of the act of withdrawal itself.
- Founding status: All three were founding ECOWAS members (May 1975), making their departure symbolically and institutionally significant.
- Identity and sovereignty signalling: The three states began distributing AES-branded passports on the withdrawal date — a deliberate sovereign signalling tool intended to consolidate identity, administration, and external recognition for the new alliance.
- Security architecture: AES announced formation of a unified 5,000‑strong military unit focused on countering jihadi and terrorist threats within AES territory — signifying the construction of a parallel regional security architecture.
- ECOWAS interim stance: To avoid immediate humanitarian, commercial and migration disruptions, ECOWAS committed to continue recognising ECOWAS-branded passports and identity cards from the withdrawing states, and to maintain free movement, residence and establishment rights, as well as ETLS treatment for goods, until further decisions are taken.

### Legal and institutional dimensions
- Compliance vs. downstream legal ambiguity: The formal 1‑year notice indicates the three states followed the treaty’s procedural exit mechanisms. Nevertheless, important downstream questions persist: which ECOWAS protocols and obligations remain binding until the effective date specified in the treaty; the status of pending ECOWAS Court of Justice rulings involving the three states; liabilities or commitments to joint infrastructure projects; and the legal regime governing cross‑border criminal prosecutions and judicial cooperation.
- Recognition and documentation: AES passports assert a new sovereign identity. Their practical utility will depend on bilateral and multilateral recognition (states, airlines, banks). ECOWAS’s temporary recognition eases the transition but “until further notice” is legally indeterminate and creates planning risks for citizens, businesses, and external partners.
- Institutional legitimacy: The departure of founding members undermines ECOWAS’s normative claims to represent West African regionalism. It raises jurisdictional and institutional questions about the Commission’s authority, resource base, and the future of ECOWAS protocols (e.g., monetary coordination, judicial mechanisms, election‑monitoring frameworks).

### Security implications
- Parallel security architecture: AES’s announced 5,000‑troop unit suggests an attempt to take ownership of security responses in its region. This risks duplication, competition, or even tension with existing regional and international counterterrorism efforts (ECOWAS security mechanisms, AU frameworks, bilateral security partnerships).
- Intelligence and coordination: Fragmentation complicates intelligence sharing, joint operations and border management. Differences in rules of engagement, command and control, and partner choices (external contractors or foreign patrons) may reduce the effectiveness of counter‑insurgency and counter‑terrorism responses and create safe havens where insurgents exploit seams.
- Force projection and militarisation risks: The institutionalisation of a military alliance can normalise interstate military cooperation that might be used for internal repression, cross‑border interventions, or contestations with neighbouring states — increasing regional instability.
- External security footprints: The Sahel’s geopolitics has attracted multiple external actors (France, Russia and private military companies, the EU, Turkey, UAE, etc.). AES formation may accelerate competition for influence, arms supplies, training, and mercenary employment, complicating international efforts at coordinated stabilisation.

### Economic and trade implications
- Market and revenue contraction: ECOWAS’s internal market shrinks materially — not only in population but in economic weight. This affects aggregate demand, customs revenue, and the economic calculus of regional infrastructure (transport corridors, energy grids) that relied on the former territorial configuration.
- Trade continuity vs. uncertainty: ECOWAS’s interim guarantee that ETLS treatment and investment policies will continue is meant to preserve trade flows and investor confidence. However, “until further notice” imposes legal ambiguity on longer‑term contracts, customs harmonisation, and rules of origin enforcement.
- Resource security and supply chains: The AES states are significant producers of minerals and agricultural commodities (uranium, gold, cotton, etc.). Changes in governance, customs arrangements, or external partnerships may affect global commodity flows and the security of supply chains that matter to external consumers, including India.
- Infrastructure and regional projects: Large cross‑border projects (roads, power interconnectors, pipelines) face planning and financing challenges if a key partner withdraws from agreed frameworks, potentially stranding investments or requiring renegotiation.

### Political and diplomatic consequences
- Erosion of ECOWAS legitimacy: The exit of founding members weakens ECOWAS’s normative authority, undermining its ability to adjudicate crises or broker agreements across the region.
- Diplomatic realignment: AES may seek alternative external partners for security, diplomacy, and economic engagement — a shift that could reconfigure influence patterns in the Sahel and broader Sahel–Sahara region. ECOWAS and the African Union (AU) may respond with mediation, conditionality, or initiatives to reintegrate or counterbalance the AES.
- Multilateral diplomacy: The withdrawal will test the AU’s capacity for regional dispute resolution, the UN’s engagement modalities, and the policy coherence of external partners (EU, France, USA, China, Russia, Turkey, Gulf states).
- Domestic political effects: Formation of AES can be used domestically to bolster regime legitimacy in each state, but it may also intensify domestic contestation if citizens or elites perceive adverse economic or political costs.

### Operational and border-management consequences
- Border governance: Practical border issues arise immediately — passport and customs checks, migration flows, potential movement of fighters, smuggling, contraband trade. Interim recognitions mitigate some disruptions but do not resolve the long-term modalities of border governance.
- Migration and humanitarian risk: Uncertainty can trigger increased irregular migration and complicate humanitarian responses, particularly if insecurity causes cross‑border displacement.
- Criminal economies: Weak enforcement and fragmented cooperation increase risks of trafficking (drugs, people, arms), illicit mining, and other transnational organised crime activities.

### Sovereignty signalling and risks of documentation non-recognition
Issuing AES passports is a powerful sovereignty claim. However:
- Travel and legal recognition depend on state and non‑state actors (receiving states, airlines, banks, international organisations) accepting those documents.
- Non‑recognition would create immediate personal and legal hardships: visa denials, difficulties with banking and property, problems in legal processes abroad, and constraints on professional mobility.
- ECOWAS’s interim acceptance reduces immediate harms but creates a temporal policy risk: a reversal or hardening of recognition policy could rapidly raise costs for citizens and businesses.

### Economic and diplomatic implications specifically relevant to India
Although geographically distant, the Sahel matter to India in several concrete ways:
- Resource interests: Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso are significant for uranium and precious minerals. Any instability or new partnerships affecting export regimes or mining contracts can affect global commodity markets and India’s diversification options for energy and raw materials.
- Trade and investment: Indian companies operating in West Africa (energy, infrastructure, pharmaceuticals, mining, telecoms) need legal certainty and safe operating environments. Institutional fragmentation increases commercial and political risk premiums.
- Diaspora and consular concerns: India’s nationals in the region (businesspeople, technical experts, contractors, students) require consistent consular access and travel documentation. Changes in passport recognition and border formalities affect visa issuance and evacuation contingencies.
- Peacekeeping and multilateral engagement: India is a major UN peacekeeping contributor and has historically sought multilateral resolution of regional conflicts. Changes in regional arrangements complicate mission mandates and cooperation with local actors.
- Strategic partnerships and influence: India’s long‑standing emphasis on multilateralism and non‑interference will constrain overt interventions but also creates openings for diplomatic mediation, development cooperation, and capacity building — tools that align with India’s strategic culture.
- Geopolitical competition: AES may deepen ties with actors that run counter to India’s interests (e.g., adversaries of Western partners), or conversely with actors that India partners with. India must navigate a crowded field — France, EU, USA, China, Russia, Turkey, Gulf states — when calibrating its responses.

### India’s strategic culture: how it frames response options
India’s strategic culture — characterised by respect for sovereignty, non‑interference, preference for multilateral solutions, incrementalism, and emphasis on political‑diplomatic engagement backed by development cooperation — suggests certain predispositions in responding to the Sahel realignment:
- Diplomatic primacy: India prefers diplomacy through multilateral forums (AU, UN, G‑77) and bilateral channels rather than coercive or unilateral measures.
- Capacity building and soft power tools: Development assistance, capacity building (police, civil administration, judiciary), and technical cooperation are preferred instruments over military footprints.
- Risk aversion in military entanglements: India is cautious about distant combat deployments but will support peacekeeping and training if properly mandated and resourced.
- Pragmatic partnerships: India adapts relations based on national interest rather than ideological alignment, which allows engagement with a range of actors while maintaining policy consistency.

### Policy options for India
Given India’s strategic culture and interests, a set of calibrated policy measures can protect Indian interests while aligning with principles of non‑interference and multilateralism:

1. Immediate consular and commercial safeguards
   - Issue clear guidance to Indian nationals and companies about travel, documentation, and contingency planning.
   - Reassess visa‑issuance procedures for citizens of the AES states until recognition questions are clarified.
   - Work with Indian companies to review contracts, force majeure clauses, and insurance cover for operations in the Sahel.

2. Diplomatic engagement and mediation support
   - Offer to support AU‑led mediation or confidence‑building measures, underscoring India’s commitment to African-led solutions.
   - Maintain balanced relations with both ECOWAS and AES states to preserve dialogue channels.

3. Development, governance and security capacity building
   - Expand technical assistance in border management, customs administration, judiciary, and police capacity to reduce illicit flows and enhance rule of law.
   - Offer tailored training programs for civil administrations to mitigate governance vacuums that can be exploited by violent non‑state actors.

4. Intelligence cooperation and counterterrorism coordination
   - Enhance information sharing with multilateral partners (UN, AU, willing bilateral partners) on terrorist financing, trafficking, and cross‑border movements, while ensuring safeguards to avoid entanglement in local political disputes.
   - Support capacity building for counter‑radicalisation and community policing efforts.

5. Economic and resource diplomacy
   - Monitor changes in mining and commodity regimes; engage diplomatically to protect existing Indian investments and explore diversification of supply sources.
   - Use lines of credit, concessional finance and public‑private partnerships to anchor Indian firms in cooperative projects that incorporate dispute-resolution mechanisms.

6. Multilateral diplomacy and institutional support
   - Back AU efforts to stabilise the region and seek coherence among external actors to avoid fragmentary, competing security footprints.
   - Advocate at the UN for mandates that prioritise civilian protection, humanitarian access, and coordination across missions.

7. Contingency planning with partners
   - Coordinate evacuation and logistics plans with friendly states and multilateral institutions for potential crises affecting Indian nationals.
   - Engage with EU, US, France, and African partners to map likely trajectories of external military involvement and their implications for regional stability.

### Watchlist — indicators India should monitor
1. ECOWAS policy decisions: whether interim recognitions are converted to permanent frameworks or reversed.
2. International acceptance of AES passports: which states, airlines and financial institutions recognise AES documents.
3. AES military deployments: timeline, rules of engagement, external advisors or contractors involved.
4. External actor responses: growing presence of Russia (including private military contractors), China, Turkey, Gulf states, EU and France.
5. Trade and customs changes: enforcement of rules of origin, ETLS continuity, and customs revenue reallocations.
6. Security incidents at borders: spikes in cross‑border attacks, trafficking or displacement.
7. Domestic politics in AES states: regime stability, elite cohesion, and public responses to alliance policies.
8. Legal claims before ECOWAS institutions: court decisions and their enforcement or non‑enforcement.
9. Changes in mining and export regimes: renegotiation of contracts, nationalisations or shifts in partner preferences.
10. Humanitarian indicators: displacement figures, humanitarian access constraints and food insecurity trends.

### Conclusion: strategic significance for India
The AES withdrawal from ECOWAS is an emblematic moment of regional institutional fragmentation in West Africa with consequences that extend beyond the Sahel. For India, the event tests the coherence of its Africa policy and the operationalisation of its strategic culture: a preference for multilateralism, non‑interference, and partnership. While India is unlikely to be compelled into direct security commitments in the Sahel, the country has tangible interests at stake — citizens, companies, resource access, multilateral engagements, and the broader international order that supports predictable rules for cross‑border cooperation.

India’s optimal posture is one of calibrated engagement: protective measures for nationals and investments; active support for AU and UN mediation; targeted capacity building to strengthen governance and border management; intelligence and counterterrorism cooperation within multilateral frameworks; and pragmatic economic diplomacy aimed at hedging risks created by institutional fragmentation. By combining principled diplomacy with practical safeguards, India can protect its interests while contributing to regional stabilisation in ways consistent with its strategic culture and long‑term national security objectives.

# Relations between the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA)

This section examines the evolving relationship between the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) — the confederation of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — and the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA, also known as WAEMU). It dissects the legal, financial and political entanglements that bind AES members to the monetary union, analyses recent tensions and policy actions (notably the AES confederal levy on non‑UEMOA imports), and draws practical lessons for policymakers studying regional integration and strategic autonomy. Although the case is geographically distant from South Asia, its institutional dynamics carry direct relevance for Indian strategic culture and national security policy: the trade‑offs between sovereignty and integration, the security implications of monetary dependence, and the governance design choices that shape exit and contingency options.

1. Background: membership, institutions and recent political context
- Membership and institutional architecture
  - AES comprises Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. UEMOA comprises eight West African states: Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea‑Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo. UEMOA is a monetary and economic union built around a shared currency, the West African CFA franc (XOF), and regional institutions — most notably the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) and the UEMOA Commission and Secretariat.
- Political context
  - The rise of the AES reflects security and political realignments in the Sahel. These states have sought closer defence and political cooperation in response to internal instability. Yet, despite the AES political grouping, its members remain formally bound to UEMOA’s monetary and trade rules. To date, none of the AES states have declared readiness to formally withdraw from UEMOA; however, measures such as the AES confederal levy signal an attempt to assert economic autonomy while technically remaining within the monetary union.

2. The monetary embedment: why leaving UEMOA is unusually difficult
- Shared currency and external guarantee
  - UEMOA members share the CFA franc (XOF). The CFA system is distinctive because the currency’s convertibility is underpinned by a guarantee from the French Treasury and reserve arrangements administered through the regional central bank (BCEAO). This architecture makes membership more than a political choice: it is a deep technical commitment involving currency convertibility, reserve management and payment‑system integration.
- Reserve entanglement and practical obstacles
  - Exiting the monetary union would require disentangling foreign‑exchange reserves that, under current arrangements, are held partly within BCEAO systems and partly in accounts guaranteed by the French Treasury. The outline claims a roughly 50/50 split between reserves held with the BCEAO (in Abidjan) and those with the French Treasury — a claim that requires precise verification and audit. Regardless of the exact split, recovering reserves held in joint or foreign‑controlled accounts is technically and diplomatically complex: it involves audits, bilateral negotiation, potential legal wrangling and likely phased or compensated transfers.
- Institutional and operational costs of exit
  - Withdrawal implies establishing new central‑bank functions (monetary policy framework, currency issuance and management), reconstituting foreign‑exchange arrangements and correspondent‑bank relationships, redenominating contracts, and reworking debt and aid agreements denominated in CFA‑linked instruments. These steps are expensive and time‑consuming and risk short‑term macroeconomic instability.

3. The AES confederal levy: a parallel financing mechanism and its frictions with UEMOA law
- Purpose and design
  - AES authorities have introduced a confederal levy on imports originating outside UEMOA to fund operations of a nascent AES regional development bank. This levy is designed to raise autonomous development finance while the AES pursues a more independent political posture.
- Legal and trade policy friction
  - UEMOA is a customs union with a common external tariff (CET) and internal rules governing trade remedies and customs procedures. A unilateral levy applied by AES members to non‑UEMOA imports could conflict with UEMOA’s CET and customs code. Such measures create legal exposure to intra‑union complaints, arbitration and potential retaliatory enforcement by other UEMOA members. The levy thus illustrates the tension between asserting regional political objectives and respecting supranational economic rules.
- Political symbolism and headquarters location
  - Burkina Faso hosts the UEMOA Secretariat/Commission headquarters. This fact raises the political and reputational costs of any unilateral departure and amplifies the domestic and regional scrutiny of AES actions aimed at fiscal or monetary separation.

4. Legal, financial and logistical barriers to withdrawal
- Treaty obligations and procedures
  - UEMOA treaty texts establish membership rules and, implicitly or explicitly, procedures for withdrawal. Formal exit is bound by treaty law; it may require notice, negotiation of outstanding obligations, and settlement procedures. Withdrawal is therefore more than a political declaration; it is a multi‑stage legal process with potential dispute‑resolution mechanisms.
- Contractual and balance‑sheet complications
  - Many public and private contracts, sovereign debts and development finance instruments among UEMOA members are denominated in CFA or anchored to BCEAO operations. Leaving requires redenominating or renegotiating these contracts, with attendant legal challenges, compensation claims and credit‑rating consequences.
- Operational continuity and payment systems
  - Integrated payment and settlement systems run by the BCEAO support intra‑regional trade and banking. Exit risks fragmentation of these systems, requiring AES members to create parallel payment rails or to negotiate access on new terms — a nontrivial logistical undertaking.

5. Economic and political implications of a potential exit
- Short‑ and medium‑term macroeconomic risks
  - An abrupt departure could trigger currency volatility and inflation (from redenomination and loss of convertibility guarantees), capital flight, bank runs, and trade disruption. Monetary policy infancy — inexperience managing open‑economy shocks — would amplify these risks.
- Fiscal and development financing costs
  - Establishing new monetary institutions and repatriating reserves would be expensive. Market access costs (higher sovereign borrowing spreads) could increase, constraining fiscal space just when stabilisation finance is most needed.
- Geopolitical and external relations consequences
  - A move to withdraw from the CFA arrangements would have geopolitical ramifications, particularly with France — the guarantor of convertibility and a major external security and development partner. It would also complicate relations with multilateral lenders (IMF, World Bank) whose programmes rely on regional frameworks.
- Domestic political economy considerations
  - Even if the strategic aim is greater autonomy, the domestic populations and private sectors of AES countries would bear immediate economic costs (higher import prices, disrupted remittance flows, banking uncertainty). Political leaders must weigh short‑term pain against long‑term autonomy gains.

6. Policy responses already evident and their analytical reading
- Staying in UEMOA while asserting autonomy
  - AES member states have, to date, not signalled formal plans to leave UEMOA. This apparent retention reflects the high coordination and transaction costs of exit, the real economic benefits of the CFA arrangement (price stability, low inflation history), and domestic political constraints.
- Parallel instruments as hedge strategies
  - The AES confederal levy and the regional development bank initiative are hedge strategies: they allow AES members to generate autonomous resources and project a degree of economic independence without triggering the systemic costs of immediate withdrawal. Such measures may be politically expedient but risk legal confrontation within UEMOA.

7. Recommendations for decision‑makers (operational checklist)
- Audit and accounting
  - Commission a comprehensive, independent audit of the composition, custody and legal ownership of foreign‑exchange reserves held under the BCEAO/French Treasury arrangements. Only precise accounting can inform feasible exit timelines and compensation frameworks.
- Scenario modelling
  - Model macroeconomic scenarios (short, medium, long term) comparing (a) remaining in UEMOA under current arrangements; (b) negotiated reform within UEMOA (e.g., special status); and (c) various exit pathways (phased un‑peg, immediate redenomination). Models should include risk of capital flight, inflation, trade disruption and fiscal costs of institutional setup.
- Legal due diligence and negotiation strategy
  - Map treaty withdrawal clauses and dispute‑resolution forums. Prepare legal positions and negotiation strategies that anticipate arbitration and bilateral negotiation with France and other UEMOA members.
- Phased and negotiated options
  - Prioritise negotiated or phased approaches that preserve payment‑system continuity and soften macroeconomic shocks: explore special statuses, waivers, or temporary dual‑currency arrangements rather than abrupt exits.
- Compatibility and mitigation for parallel measures
  - Assess the AES confederal levy against UEMOA customs law; seek legal pathways (waivers, exemptions) to avoid trade disputes. Design the levy so that it minimizes distortions to intra‑UEMOA trade while achieving its financing objectives.
- External engagement and contingency financing
  - Engage the IMF, World Bank and bilateral partners early to secure technical assistance and contingent financing lines that can ease currency transition costs, should a move to depart be pursued.

8. Stakeholder map and political economy
- Primary decision‑makers
  - AES governments (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger): political choices and domestic legitimacy considerations will drive the pace and extent of change.
- UEMOA institutions
  - BCEAO, UEMOA Commission and Secretariat: institutional guardians of the monetary union and principal interlocutors in any renegotiation.
- External actors
  - French Treasury and bilateral partners: holders/guarantors of convertibility privileges and reserves; their cooperation or resistance will shape feasible exit options.
  - Multilateral lenders and technical partners (IMF, World Bank): potential financiers and technical advisors for transition arrangements.
- Domestic actors
  - Private sector, banking system and civil society: immediate bearers of economic consequences; their reactions can determine political viability.

9. Key uncertainties and questions requiring clarification
- Precise reserve ownership and custody arrangements: the oft‑cited “50/50” split between BCEAO and the French Treasury needs rigorous verification and legal clarification.
- Treaty mechanisms: what exact clauses govern withdrawal, notice periods, and settlement of outstanding commitments under UEMOA legal instruments?
- Legal exposure of AES fiscal measures: can the AES confederal levy be justified under existing UEMOA law, or will it provoke sanctions and disputes?
- Political appetite: do domestic publics and elites in AES member states accept the short‑term economic pain that separation would almost certainly entail?

10. Comparative lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
Though India does not face a CFA‑style monetary union in its immediate strategic environment, several transferable lessons are salient for Indian policymakers reflecting on regional integration, sovereignty and strategic autonomy:
- Deep economic integration constrains rapid political manoeuvre. Monetary and payment‑system linkages create durable technical dependencies; strategic planners must treat such commitments as long‑term and operational, not merely symbolic.
- Exit design matters. If a state anticipates that it may need to decouple from an international or regional arrangement for political or security reasons, it should negotiate clear legal exit clauses and contingency access to reserves or liquidity in advance.
- Parallel instruments as hedges are double‑edged. Creating parallel fiscal or trade instruments (e.g., levies, special funds) can buy political space without abandoning integration — but they risk breaching legal obligations and provoking retaliatory measures that increase insecurity.
- External guarantors shape strategic options. Reliance on external actors for monetary guarantees (or security guarantees) can provide stability but also produces leverage that adversaries or partners can exploit in crises.
- Prepare technical capacity before political decisions. Establishing independent central bank capabilities, foreign‑exchange management systems and correspondent banking networks takes time; strategic plans to alter monetary arrangements must be accompanied by technical capacity building and donor engagement.
For India, which balances regional ambitions (neighbourhood first, SAGAR in the Indian Ocean, Act East) with a desire for strategic autonomy, these lessons emphasize prudent treaty design, layered contingency planning and sustained investments in economic statecraft that preserve flexibility.

11. Conclusion
The AES–UEMOA relationship is illustrative of the inherent tensions between political assertions of sovereignty and the deep, often invisible, entanglements of monetary unions. AES member states retain formal membership in UEMOA because the institutional, financial and legal costs of exit are substantial. Measures such as the AES confederal levy show how states may seek partial autonomy through parallel instruments, but such actions risk legal conflict and economic instability. For policymakers — whether in West Africa or in capitals like New Delhi studying comparable dilemmas — the pragmatic path combines rigorous audit and modelling, negotiated reform where possible, phased contingency planning, and early external engagement to mitigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical costs of reconfiguring entrenched monetary arrangements.

Questions for further research
- What precise legal mechanisms in UEMOA treaties could be used to negotiate a special status for dissident members?
- How have other monetary unions managed partial departures or parallel arrangements historically, and what empirical lessons do those cases offer?
- What are the distributive political effects within AES countries (sectoral winners and losers) from an abrupt monetary regime change?

### The Confederation of Sahel States: announcement, implications, and relevance for Indian strategic culture

Introduction  
In recent years a grouping often referred to as the “Confederation of Sahel States” — associated most prominently with Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — has publicly announced a set of policy measures and political objectives framed around regional stability, economic independence and self-reliance. Though statements of intent are not in themselves concrete policy, they signal important strategic reorientation in a fragile sub‑region whose dynamics have implications well beyond West Africa. For readers of this book on India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the Sahel’s trajectory offers both direct lessons (for India’s Africa policy and defence diplomacy) and useful comparative insights into how states articulate autonomy, organise regionally, and manage security‑economic trade‑offs.

1. Reading the announcement: subject, act, scope and stated goals
- Subject: a regional political/military grouping in the Sahel  
  The term “Confederation” implies a degree of institutionalisation and coordination above episodic cooperation. Even when membership and formal legal instruments are not publicly available, nomenclature matters: a confederation denotes shared institutions, pooled resources or joint command arrangements rather than purely bilateral or ad hoc measures.
- Action: an official/public declaration  
  Public announcements are instruments of strategy as much as policy: they aim to consolidate domestic legitimacy, communicate resolve to external actors, and shape bargaining space in diplomacy. In the Sahel the signal is as important as the substance.
- Scope: “various measures”  
  The phrase is deliberately broad; such measures may cut across security (joint military operations, shared intelligence), economic (new trade corridors, currency or fiscal alignment), governance (legal harmonisation), and social policy (population support programs).
- Stated goals: regional stability, economic independence, self‑reliance  
  Each term carries discrete ambitions:
  - Regional stability: suppression or management of insurgency and cross‑border criminality, stabilisation of fragile regimes, restoration of state control.
  - Economic independence: reducing dependency on traditional external donors/partners and developing domestic or intra‑regional economic capacity.
  - Self‑reliance: a broader political posture that embraces independent decision‑making in security, governance and economic affairs.

2. Interpretation and likely implications
- Security integration and its risks  
  If measures prioritise joint military capacity or integrated commands, they may improve operational effectiveness against non‑state armed groups but also raise concerns about civilian oversight, rule of law and human rights. The nature of command, reporting, and external oversight will determine whether security gains are sustainable and legitimate.
- Political signalling and global realignment  
  Emphasis on economic independence and self‑reliance often accompanies outreach to alternative external partners (state and non‑state). This shifts geopolitical alignments, complicates the calculus of regional bodies (ECOWAS, AU) and external actors (EU, UN, major powers), and can create new dependencies if not carefully managed.
- Economic feasibility and constraints  
  Moving toward genuine economic independence requires capital, institutional capacity, market access and specialised skills. Absent viable financing and trade linkages, rhetoric risks producing isolation and economic contraction rather than resilience.
- Domestic legitimacy and cohesion  
  Such announcements can bolster ruling elites domestically, particularly after political ruptures (coups, regime transitions). But if implementation produces economic hardship or rights abuses, the very legitimacy such measures seek to fortify may be undermined.
- Humanitarian and human‑rights considerations  
  Security‑first responses without clear safeguards can exacerbate humanitarian crises and reduce the operating space for civil society and independent media — affecting the information environment and long‑term governance.

3. Sahel contextual background necessary for assessment
- Actors and typical membership  
  The Sahel’s principal state actors implicated in confederative initiatives have included Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger; however, membership is fluid and should be verified against primary texts. Non‑state armed groups, traffickers and transnational militants are central drivers of insecurity.
- Recent regional dynamics  
  A sequence of coups and governance crises altered relations with regional institutions (notably ECOWAS) and long‑standing partners. These ruptures have made regional coordination more attractive as a way to insulate regimes from outside pressure.
- Typical policy instruments in this environment  
  Governments in the Sahel have used combinations of joint military operations, tightened border regimes, suspension or renegotiation of foreign military basing arrangements, and the pursuit of new trade or financial arrangements to reduce dependence on former partners.
- External partnerships and alternatives  
  Engagements with non‑Western states, private military companies and bilateral deals have increased. These alternatives carry diplomatic and operational implications — they can be immediate sources of capability but may create longer‑term strategic liabilities.
- Monitoring needs for impact assessment  
  To understand outcomes one must track policy texts, budgets, command structures, independent human‑rights reporting, humanitarian impact, and reactions from regional and global organisations.

4. Relevance to Indian strategic culture and national security policy
India’s strategic culture emphasises strategic autonomy, non‑alignment, pragmatic multipolar engagement and capacity‑building in partner states. The Sahel case resonates with Indian thinking in several ways:
- Strategic autonomy and regional confederations  
  The Sahel’s pursuit of self‑reliance parallels India’s emphasis on strategic autonomy — but also offers cautionary lessons: autonomy requires credible institutions and economic depth, not only political declarations.
- Defence diplomacy and capacity building  
  India’s long‑standing approach to Africa — training, capacity building, humanitarian assistance and limited defence cooperation — contrasts with purely security‑first interventions. The Sahel experience suggests India should emphasise institutional strengthening, rule‑of‑law and non‑coercive security assistance where it engages.
- Managing partnerships and reputational risk  
  As Sahel states diversify partners, India must balance opportunities (e.g., energy, minerals, markets) against reputational risks associated with governments that have weak human‑rights records. Indian strategic culture’s sensitivity to legitimacy and soft power argues for calibrated engagement that supports governance and civilian resilience.
- Economic diplomacy and supply‑chain resilience  
  Indian interests in natural resources, trade routes and markets mean Sahel stability has practical relevance. India can support intra‑regional trade facilitation, infrastructure financing (through concessional lines or multilateral vehicles), and capacity for resource governance to reduce volatility.
- Counterterrorism cooperation and intelligence sharing  
  India’s experience with insurgency, counter‑radicalisation and internal security offers transferable expertise (police training, community policing, deradicalisation programs) that can complement military assistance.
- Multilateral engagement and norms promotion  
  India should use multilateral fora (AU, UN, and African regional institutions) to advocate for approaches that marry security assistance with governance, human‑rights safeguards and humanitarian protections. This aligns with India’s preference for rules-based, multilateral problem‑solving.

5. Policy implications and recommendations for Indian engagement
- Prioritise institutional capacity over hardware  
  India’s comparative advantage in training, police reform and governance assistance should be emphasised. Building sustainable institutions mitigates the risk of short‑term security gains that erode long‑term stability.
- Maintain principled, pragmatic balance in partnerships  
  India can engage new Sahel authorities for practical cooperation while conditioning deeper security ties on observance of basic human‑rights and civilian control. Quiet diplomacy and development conditionalities can be effective tools.
- Expand economic connectivity strategically  
  Support for regional infrastructure, value‑chain development and market linkages will do more for “economic independence” in the Sahel than narrow bilateral trade deals. Multilateral financing and risk‑sharing mechanisms can be mobilised.
- Support transparency and oversight in any security cooperation  
  Where India provides security assistance, ensure clear rules of engagement, parliamentary oversight and metrics for evaluating adherence to humanitarian norms.
- Use multilateral platforms to encourage inclusive solutions  
  Encourage AU/ECOWAS engagement, humanitarian access and the involvement of civil society in any stabilisation efforts. India’s votes and diplomacy in the UN can promote comprehensive strategies that mix relief, development and security.

6. Operational follow‑up questions and data points to monitor
- What are the concrete measures announced (texts of agreements, memoranda, or policies)?  
- Which states are formal signatories and what legal/constitutional processes underpin their commitment?  
- Are institutional architectures (joint commands, financing arrangements, oversight bodies) publicly specified? What are budgets and timelines?  
- How do regional organisations (ECOWAS, AU) and the UN respond? Are there sanctions, recognitions or mediation offers?  
- What external partners (states, firms, private military actors) are being engaged and on what terms?  
- What safeguards exist (or are proposed) for civilian protection, humanitarian access and legal oversight?  
- What indicators show economic impact (trade flows, investment, fiscal balances) and security outcomes (incident rates, displacement, human‑rights reports)?

Conclusion  
Announced measures by a Sahel confederative grouping articulate familiar 21st‑century aspirations: stability through regional cooperation, the pursuit of economic independence, and a posture of self‑reliance. For India, the Sahel’s choices are both an object lesson and a potential field of engagement. India’s strategic culture — marked by an emphasis on autonomy, multilateralism and capacity building — can offer constructive avenues of cooperation that avoid the pitfalls of militarised or purely transactional engagement. Yet the effectiveness of any policy response depends on careful monitoring of concrete instruments, insistence on governance safeguards, and a sustained commitment to institution‑building rather than short‑term transactional gains.

### Chapter X: Regional Monetary and Infrastructure Integration in the Sahel — Comparative Lessons for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Introduction

Recent developments in the Sahel — notably proposals for a common central bank and currency to replace the CFA franc, joint infrastructure programs in agriculture and energy, the imposition of export controls on grain, and a May 2025 meeting of energy regulators from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in Bamako — illustrate a compact of states pursuing greater economic sovereignty and regional resilience under severe security and governance stress. While these events concern the Alliance of Sahel States and West African regional institutions, they also illuminate broader questions that are central to India's strategic culture and national security policy: how states design institutions to protect strategic autonomy, manage economic interdependence, and build resilience in the face of external pressures.

This section analyses the Sahel initiatives in detail, draws out the political‑economic mechanics and risks involved, and extracts practical lessons for Indian policymakers engaged in Africa and formulating resilience-driven national security strategies at home.

1. Background: actors, institutions and historical context

- The actors. The Alliance of Sahel States (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) — states confronting insurgency, fragile governance, and economic strain — is pursuing deeper cooperation as part of a bid to consolidate autonomy and mutual support.
- The monetary legacy. The CFA franc (both West and Central variants) has for decades linked many Francophone African countries to the French Treasury’s arrangements and, since the euro’s creation, to the euro. This arrangement has provided exchange‑rate stability and access to convertibility guarantees, but it has also been widely criticised as a constraint on monetary sovereignty.
- Regional architecture. ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) governs trade, movement and monetary cooperation in West Africa. Unilateral measures by member states — such as export controls — can create friction with ECOWAS legal frameworks and political objectives.

2. Monetary integration: proposal for a common central bank and new currency

a. Institutional design challenges

Creating a common central bank and a new regional currency is fundamentally an institutional exercise requiring agreement on governance (board composition, voting rules), fiscal‑monetary coordination rules, capitalisation, foreign exchange reserve management and payments infrastructure. The transition also needs robust legal foundations via treaties and domestic implementing legislation.

b. Exchange‑rate regime and policy trade‑offs

Replacing the CFA franc would likely entail abandoning or reconfiguring the peg to the euro. That choice involves trade‑offs: a peg provides inflation anchoring and credibility; a flexible or managed float increases policy autonomy but risks volatility unless backed by credible monetary frameworks and adequate reserves.

c. Technical and capacity prerequisites

Operationalising a central bank and currency requires skilled economists, payments systems and settlement infrastructure, foreign‑exchange reserves, and clear transitional rules to manage convertibility, redenomination and contracts. Without these, a currency launch risks capital flight, inflation pressures and severe financial disruption.

d. Implications for India’s strategic thinking

India’s strategic culture prizes strategic autonomy. The Sahel case underscores that autonomy in monetary policy is costly and demands institutional depth. For India’s external engagements (development finance, capacity building in Africa) and internal policy design, this underscores the value of calibrated, capacity‑building assistance rather than pushing rapid institutional change without support.

3. Economic sovereignty and joint infrastructure programs (agriculture and energy)

a. Nature of proposed projects

Joint programs to boost agricultural self‑reliance and energy security likely encompass irrigation, storage and transport logistics; utility‑scale and distributed power generation; transmission interconnections; and cross‑border facilities to pool resources and reduce unit costs.

b. Financing and execution realities

Large infrastructure requires multi‑source financing: national budgets, concessional MDB loans, bilateral partners, and private participation. Technical project management, anti‑corruption safeguards and operation & maintenance arrangements are critical to ensure long‑term returns.

c. Strategic parallels for India

India’s own security calculus recognizes that food and energy resilience underpin stability. For India, lessons include structuring foreign assistance that builds host‑country capacity, offering finance models (grants, concessional loans, lines of credit) that blend development and strategic objectives, and supporting decentralized renewable solutions that fit local contexts.

4. Trade management and export controls on grain

a. Rationale and short‑term effects

Export controls on grain are a common emergency instrument to preserve domestic food availability and tame price spikes. In the short term they can stabilise local markets and prevent domestic unrest.

b. Regional and market consequences

Export restrictions can distort markets, encourage hoarding, depress producer incentives, and provoke shortages in neighbouring import‑dependent areas. Within ECOWAS, such measures risk legal and political dispute and may invite retaliatory trade policies.

c. Policy lessons for India

India has periodically used export controls for staple commodities (e.g., rice, wheat) during domestic shortages. The Sahel experience reinforces that such measures must be time‑bound, transparent, and accompanied by targeted safety nets for the poor and compensatory measures for producers. When applied in an external engagement context, India should advise partners on mitigation of regional spillovers and on complementary supply‑chain investments.

5. Energy regulatory coordination and the push for renewables (Bamako meeting, May 2025)

a. Significance of regulator meeting

Energy regulators from Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger meeting in Bamako to harmonise policies indicates concrete political will for regulatory alignment, energy security coordination and joint promotion of renewables. It signals a shift from ad hoc bilateral arrangements toward supranational rule‑making in a critical sector.

b. Technical focus and appropriate technologies

Given Sahel geography and resource endowments, priority areas include utility and distributed solar (including mini‑grids), off‑grid solutions, battery storage, and selective hydro or wind where feasible. Cross‑border transmission and pooled procurement can achieve economies of scale.

c. Regional integration benefits and hazards

Coordinated regulation lowers transaction costs, attracts investment and enables cross‑border power trading. However, regulatory convergence must address tariff harmonisation, cost‑recovery frameworks and governance to avoid political capture or misallocation of scarce capital.

d. Relevance to India

India’s renewable energy enterprises and regulatory experience (national solar mission, large‑scale auction models, distributed solar programmes) position it as a potential partner. For India’s national security strategy, facilitating energy partnerships in fragile regions serves both development and strategic ends — provided projects are de‑risked and tailored to local conditions.

6. Risks, trade‑offs and political/diplomatic dimensions

- Monetary risks. De‑pegging from the euro without credible policy anchors risks currency volatility and inflation, which can amplify political instability.
- Diplomatic repercussions. Moving away from the CFA arrangement and imposing export controls can trigger diplomatic pushback from former colonial powers, regional bodies (ECOWAS), and investors; it can also push states toward alternative partners (e.g., Russia, China) offering rapid support.
- Economic disruption. Export controls and hastily implemented reforms can strain regional supply chains and food security in dependent countries.
- Capacity and financing constraints. Ambitious infrastructure plans can fail without the requisite managerial and technical capacities and sustainable financing.

7. Opportunities and positive outcomes

- Enhanced resilience. Well‑designed infrastructure and energy investments can reduce vulnerability to external shocks and improve long‑term development prospects.
- Greater policy autonomy. A regional central bank/currency could, in theory, better align monetary policy with local economic cycles and structural requirements.
- Attracting renewable investment. Coordinated regulatory frameworks and pooled projects create scale attractive to private capital and donors.
- Developmental dividends. Agricultural productivity gains and modernised energy systems can expand employment and reduce migration pressures.

8. Practical recommendations for policy‑makers (with specific relevance to Indian policy and strategic posture)

a. For Sahel states and regional bodies (general guidance)
- Phase monetary transitions and create staged benchmarks (reserve targets, institutional capacity milestones) to build credibility before full de‑pegging.
- Use export controls sparingly and transparently; accompany measures with safety nets and regional dialogue to reduce spillovers.
- Prioritise small‑ to medium‑scale, high‑impact agricultural and decentralized renewable projects that can be deployed quickly and managed locally.
- Harmonise regulatory frameworks gradually, starting with technical standards and cross‑border pilot projects to build trust.

b. For Indian policymakers and strategic planners
- Offer targeted capacity building: technical assistance for central‑bank operations, payments systems, and energy regulation, framed as development partnership rather than geopolitical competition.
- Provide finance for distributed renewable projects and agricultural value chains via concessional lines of credit, blended finance, and support for public‑private partnerships that include strong governance clauses.
- Advise on and support transparent transition frameworks for any monetary reform, emphasising reserve adequacy, market communication, and social protection measures.
- Coordinate with multilateral institutions (World Bank, African Development Bank), ECOWAS and other regional actors to avoid bilateral, ad hoc interventions that could foster political backlash.
- Use India’s diplomatic engagement in the Sahel to promote inclusive, resilience‑focused policies that reduce the appeal of external security or economic patrons who may impose dependency.

9. Conclusion: strategic culture, agency and the limits of institutional design

The Sahel initiatives reflect a strategic impulse familiar to Indian strategic culture: a desire for autonomy, resilience and regionally tailored solutions. Yet autonomy requires institutions, resources and political capital. For India, the lessons are twofold. First, promoting sovereignty and resilience abroad — whether through finance, regulatory advice or technology transfer — must be accompanied by capacity building and patient institution‑building. Second, at home and in foreign policy, India’s preference for strategic autonomy is best advanced by pragmatic, phased engagement that recognises technical constraints and regional interdependencies.

Comparative cases such as the Sahel underscore a core element of contemporary national security policy: institutional design matters as much as ambition. Policymakers who balance political objectives with technical realism will better secure both domestic resilience and constructive international partnerships.

## Case study: The Confederal Bank for Investment and Development (CBID) — regional finance as an instrument of “financial sovereignty” in the Sahel and implications for Indian strategic thinking

Introduction  
In May 2025 the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) announced the creation of the Confederal Bank for Investment and Development (CBID). Though the AES is a regional organisation distinct from India’s neighbourhood, the CBID exemplifies a broader global trend: states and regional blocs creating dedicated financial institutions to assert policy autonomy, accelerate infrastructure-led development, and reduce dependence on established multilateral lenders. For an Indian audience concerned with strategic culture and national security policy, the CBID offers a useful comparative lens—both for understanding how regional finance can be instrumentally tied to strategic objectives, and for deriving practical lessons when India formulates its own regional engagement and economic-security strategies.

1. The announcement and stated purpose
- What was announced: AES declared the establishment of the Confederal Bank for Investment and Development (CBID) as of May 2025. The announcement framed the CBID as a new regional financial institution dedicated to financing development and critical infrastructure across AES member states.
- Stated objective: to provide autonomous, regional financing tailored to the Sahel’s infrastructure and development priorities—roads, energy, water, connectivity and social infrastructure—thereby shortening project cycles and aligning investment with AES strategic aims.

2. Strategic rationale: financial sovereignty as policy lever
- Reduction of external dependence: The CBID is explicitly framed to reduce AES reliance on external financial institutions—IMF, World Bank, and bilateral lenders—whose conditionalities and policy priorities may not align with regional preferences.
- Financial sovereignty: AES leadership cast the CBID as a concrete step toward “financial sovereignty,” a political and policy concept that links control over finance to broader autonomy in economic, security, and developmental decision‑making.
- Instrumental linkage to other pillars: The CBID is embedded in AES’s stated four-pillar strategy—collective security, economic integration, cultural/educational identity, and financial sovereignty—indicating that finance is being shaped as a tool to undergird security cooperation and political integration, not merely an economic instrument.

3. Implicit political and signaling effects
- Regional control of priorities: Establishing a regional development bank signals the AES’s intent to set its own development timetable and criteria, and to prioritize projects with strong regional public goods characteristics.
- External messaging: The move communicates to external creditors and strategic partners that the AES expects to be a partner rather than a policy taker; it also creates bargaining leverage in negotiations over aid, loans, or security assistance.
- Domestic legitimacy: Domestic political audiences can interpret the CBID as a demonstration that AES members are taking tangible steps to manage their own development trajectory.

4. Likely core functions and institutional architecture
The CBID, as announced and by analogy with similar regional development banks, would reasonably be expected to pursue the following functions:
- Project lending: sovereign and sub‑sovereign loans for infrastructure and social projects.
- Co-financing: partnering with bilateral donors, multilateral institutions, and commercial lenders to assemble finance packages.
- Capital mobilisation: initial paid‑in member capital complemented by bond issuance in regional/international markets and mobilisation of diaspora/private capital.
- Structuring PPPs and guarantees: designing public‑private partnerships and offering partial risk guarantees to attract private investors.
- Technical assistance and capacity building: offering project preparation, procurement, and legal/financial advisory support.

Institutional features critical to these functions include: initial capitalization and lending window design; a clear credit policy; sovereign vs. non‑sovereign lending modalities; risk management and provisioning rules; and a governance structure that balances member influence with professional management.

5. Implementation requirements for credibility and operationality
For CBID to be effective and to attract co‑financiers, it needs:
- Sufficient initial capitalization: adequate paid‑in capital and a credible replenishment/supplementation plan to permit an early, demonstrable pipeline of projects.
- Clear governance and transparency structures: a statutes/charter that provides for independent professional management, anti‑corruption safeguards, external audits, and public reporting.
- Legal and regulatory harmonization: member‑state legislation allowing the bank to operate across jurisdictions, lend, recover assets, and enforce contracts.
- Risk management frameworks: robust credit assessment, portfolio diversification, provisioning rules, and contingency planning for macro shocks.
- Access to technical expertise: early partnerships for capacity building (project preparation, procurement standards, environmental and social safeguards).
- Market access and ratings engagement: an early program of engagement with rating agencies and potential investors to establish the bank’s credit profile.

6. Operational challenges and risks
Establishing a regional bank in the Sahel context entails acute challenges:
- Capital mobilisation: raising sufficient paid‑in capital within relatively low‑income member states, and establishing credibility to issue bonds externally.
- Credit risk and pipeline quality: ensuring a high‑quality, bankable project pipeline while avoiding politically driven or low‑return projects.
- Currency and FX risk: the Sahel includes different currency regimes and exposures; the bank will need FX hedging strategies and appropriate currency denomination policies.
- Governance and corruption vulnerabilities: political interference, weak procurement systems, and weak judicial enforcement can undermine asset quality.
- Diplomatic backlash: traditional donors and multilateral lenders may react by conditioning or reshaping their assistance; competing external powers may court the AES, complicating diplomatic alignments.
- Regional instability: security risks (insurgency, state fragility) increase project risk and raise the cost of capital.

7. Geopolitical implications
- Enhanced bargaining power: a functional CBID would strengthen AES’s negotiating position vis‑à‑vis global lenders and bilateral partners.
- Strategic contestation: external actors (e.g., major powers seeking influence in the Sahel) could either offer concessional lines to the CBID or seek to influence its governance, potentially creating new vectors of rivalry.
- Donor relations re‑configured: the presence of a regional bank can reorient how donor funds are channelled—either complementing the bank or bypassing it if trust is absent.
- Precedent effect: the CBID adds to a tapestry of regionally owned development banks (e.g., African Development Bank, New Development Bank, AIIB) that collectively alter the architecture of development finance.

8. Potential benefits for the Sahel region
- Faster, regionally aligned financing: shorter decision cycles and better alignment with regional infrastructure priorities.
- Reduced conditionality: financing less subject to external policy prescriptions, potentially increasing perceived policy space.
- Improved integration: financing cross‑border infrastructure that enhances markets, movement, and security cooperation.
- Catalysing regional capital markets: bond issuances and pooled asset management could spur nascent capital markets.
- Capacity building: the bank can create institutional capability in project preparation, procurement, and financial management.

9. Recommended priorities to establish credibility and effectiveness
For the CBID to achieve its intended strategic and developmental goals, the following priorities are essential:
- Enshrine transparent governance: independent management, strong audit functions, clear conflict‑of‑interest rules, and open procurement.
- Diversify funding sources: combine member capital, concessional lines from sympathetic partners, diaspora bonds, and market issuances to avoid overreliance on any single source.
- Prioritise project quality over quantity: invest in a small number of high‑quality, regionally transformative projects at the outset to build track record.
- Adopt robust safeguards and risk management: environmental and social safeguards, anti‑corruption measures, and contingency provisioning.
- Seek external technical partnerships: early cooperation with established MDBs and technical partners for capacity building and co‑financing mechanisms.
- Engage ratings agencies and potential investors early: transparency and a credible pipeline will aid in securing favorable market access.

10. Lessons and implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
The CBID case offers direct and indirect lessons for Indian policymakers concerned with strategic autonomy, regional influence, and national security:

- Debt and autonomy: Regional finance institutions are instruments to reduce dependency and shape policy space. India’s strategic culture prizes autonomy—CBID demonstrates how institutional finance can be deployed to that end. India should assess how its own development assistance and financial initiatives can preserve autonomy while promoting stability in its strategic neighbourhood (SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA).

- Institution‑building as influence: Institutions endure and shape behaviour; India’s investments in regional finance (or multilateral alternatives) are investments in long‑term influence. India can support transparent regional institutions by offering technical assistance in banking governance, project preparation, and capacity building—areas of comparative advantage.

- Balancing partnerships and sovereignty: The AES intends to balance external relations by creating domestic capacity. India should adopt a pragmatic posture—working with regional banks where they exist, offering complementary finance, and avoiding actions that simply replicate conditionality that undermines host‑government ownership.

- Security–development linkage: For India, the CBID illustrates the tight coupling between development financing and security outcomes. India’s national security policy should integrate economic instruments (lines of credit, concessional finance, infrastructure investment) as tools of stabilization and influence—particularly in the Indian Ocean and neighbourhood.

- Standards and credibility: India’s credibility as a partner is enhanced if it insists on, and assists partners to adopt, transparent governance and anti‑corruption safeguards. Engagements that build institutional capacity earn greater long‑term trust than episodic grants.

- Strategic competition and cooperation: The emergence of regional banks can alter strategic competition—China, Russia, the EU and others will respond. India should calibrate policy to leverage multilateral channels, engage regionally to protect its economic interests, and seek cooperative arrangements (co‑financing, technical partnerships) that both advance development and preserve strategic autonomy.

Practical policy recommendations for India
- Monitor and engage: Establish a regular interagency mechanism (MEA, MoF, EXIM Bank, DoS) to track CBID developments and identify opportunities for partnership or co‑financing, especially in areas of Indian interest (connectivity, energy, coastal security).
- Offer technical assistance: Propose Indian technical programmes on bank governance, project preparation facilities, and digital procurement platforms that combine capacity building with soft power.
- Use finance strategically: Leverage India’s export credit and lines of credit to co‑finance CBID‑backed projects to ensure continuity and alignment with Indian firms’ participation.
- Advocate for transparency: Insist on publicly available project appraisal documents, procurement transparency, and safeguards in any co‑financing arrangements.
- Regional export controls and risk mitigation: Update India’s risk frameworks to account for investments in fragile contexts—use political risk insurance and blended finance mechanisms to protect Indian private sector actors.

Conclusion
The CBID’s creation is emblematic of a contemporary trend: regions seeking to reclaim policy space by building their own development finance architecture. For India, the principal lessons center on the strategic utility of institution‑building, the importance of governance and credibility, and the need to integrate economic instruments into national security thinking. India should neither reflexively oppose nor uncritically embrace new regional banks; instead, it should develop a layered policy that protects its interests, supports transparent institution‑building, and uses finance as a tool to advance stability, connectivity, and long‑term influence in critical regions.

## Symbolic Consolidation: The AES Flag Launch (22 February 2025) — Significance, Process and Implications

Summary of the event
- Date and event: On 22 February 2025 an official ceremony took place to launch a flag for the Alliance of Sahel States (AES).
- Actors executing the launch: Ministers of the grouping — described in reports as representing the “Confederation of Sahel States” — carried out the public unveiling.
- Prior validation: The flag had been validated (approved) by the heads of state of the member countries prior to the ministers’ public launch.
- Procedural inference: The sequence (heads of state → ministers) indicates a top‑down ratification and implementation process: supreme political endorsement followed by ministerial execution and public institutionalisation.

Organisational identity and nomenclature
- The text uses both “Alliance of Sahel States (AES)” and “Confederation of Sahel States” to identify the same entity. This dual terminology may reflect translation choices, provisional naming during institutional development, or competing narratives of what the grouping aspires to become (an alliance, a confederation).
- Historically, AES’s core membership has included Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger; however, membership configurations in the Sahel have been fluid in recent years. Any analytical treatment must therefore verify the exact states that were signatories or whose heads of state validated the symbol on the stated date.

Why a flag matters: symbolic and institutional functions
- Visual identity and institutional consolidation: Adoption of a flag is a routine but potent step in the life‑cycle of regional bodies. A flag supplies a common visual shorthand for the organisation at summits, in communiqués, on installations, and in external representation.
- Legitimacy and messaging: For regimes and blocs whose domestic or international legitimacy may be contested, a new flag is a tool of narrative construction — it projects unity, permanence and a claim to sovereign institutional status.
- Internal cohesion: Symbols contribute to a sense of shared belonging among member institutions (militaries, ministries, bureaucracies) and can accelerate the material integration of joint capacities (joint commands, communications, insignia standardisation).

Protocol, practical follow‑up and administrative steps
- Standards and specifications: After formal adoption, typical next steps are publication of visual specifications (colours, proportions, permissible variants), flags manufacturing standards, and protocols for display (order of precedence with national flags, use in ceremonies).
- Institutionalisation: Administrative acts often follow — registration of the emblem in internal registries, translation into legal or charter language, production of signage for headquarters and joint facilities, and distribution to military and diplomatic contingents.
- Communications: The flag becomes a communications asset for public diplomacy and recruitment of external partners; guidance for its use will govern whether and how it appears on documents, uniforms and vehicles.

Diplomatic and regional implications
- Recognition dynamics: While a new symbol is primarily an internal tool, its external reception is political. States or organisations that do not recognise current leadership in member states may decline to treat the AES flag as an international emblem deserving of formal recognition. Conversely, some partners may accept the flag de facto for pragmatic engagement.
- Friction with other regional bodies: The institutionalisation of a separate Sahel bloc risks deepening disagreement with regional organisations that have been in adversarial relationships with some AES members (for example ECOWAS or, in certain contexts, the African Union). A flag can therefore be read as a signal of deeper commitment to a parallel institutional path.
- External signalling: For third‑party states (European capitals, China, Gulf states, and India), the flag’s adoption is an indicator that the grouping seeks consolidated identity and policy autonomy — a factor to weigh in future bilateral or multilateral dealings.

Operational and security implications
- Military identification: A formal emblem aids identification in joint operations and can streamline interoperability: insignia, unit flags, shared operational logos and unified markings on equipment and installations reduce ambiguity on the battlefield and in logistics.
- Command and control: The symbolic step may presage practical steps toward shared command arrangements, joint exercises, or integrated logistics; analysts should watch for accompanying agreements on rules of engagement, basing, or force‑generation.
- Intelligence and contingency planning: Security services will reassess force postures and contingency plans in light of any move toward permanent institutionalisation of joint forces or bases.

Legitimacy, messaging and the international legal frame
- De jure versus de facto status: The launch of a flag does not in itself create legal personality under international law, but it can be part of an incremental process of asserting institutional existence and diplomatic agency.
- Messaging to domestic audiences: Internally, the flag can be used to consolidate popular support and normalise new governing arrangements by projecting stability and permanence.
- International legal instruments: Analysts should examine whether a charter, statute or treaty was published alongside the flag and whether such instruments were ratified domestically — these are the texts that confer legal commitments and obligations.

Terminology and record‑keeping
- Reconciliation of names: Analysts and archivists should reconcile “Alliance” and “Confederation” usages in primary sources to avoid confusion in records and translations. Verify the formal name in official communiqués, charters, and government gazettes.
- Archival practice: Preserve all versions of the emblem and associated visual specifications, and note the authority and date of each endorsement.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Why India should care: Developments in the Sahel affect wider strategic environments — terrorism, migration, trans‑Saharan trafficking, and the footprint of other external actors (e.g., Russia’s Wagner group, European security actors, China) all have implications for Indian interests in Africa, counterterrorism partnerships and resource access. A consolidating Sahel bloc with a common symbol signals potential institutional longevity and therefore matters for diplomatic and security calculations.
- Policy options for India
  - Observe and verify: Maintain a cautious approach initially — collect primary documentation (charter, standards, list of signatories) and monitor how the flag is operationalised before altering diplomatic protocols.
  - Calibrate recognition and engagement: Continue to evaluate recognition decisions state‑by‑state while tailoring functional engagement (development projects, training, counterterrorism cooperation) according to legal and reputational risk assessments.
  - Multilateral coordination: Use India’s partnerships with the African Union, the UN and regional organisations to align responses to institutional changes and to avoid inadvertent diplomatic friction.
  - Security cooperation: Assess whether India’s current and planned security cooperation (training, defence exports, police capacity building, UN peacekeeping contingents) will need adjustments — e.g., where to display emblems, rules of engagement with AES formations, and contingency planning for evacuations or force protection.
  - Soft power and messaging: If India pursues deeper engagement, consider whether Indian assistance (e.g., capacity building, development projects) should carry neutral branding or include acknowledgement of any new regional emblems, depending on political sensitivities.
- Strategic lessons for Indian policymakers
  - Symbolism matters: Institutional symbols are more than ornaments; they help construct reality. India’s strategic culture, which values long‑term relationships and norms, should factor symbolic consolidation into its diplomatic risk‑assessment frameworks.
  - Flexibility and principled engagement: India’s traditional emphasis on sovereignty and non‑interference allows space for pragmatic engagement, but that must be balanced against commitments to democracy, human rights and multilateral norms where relevant.
  - Early warning and adaptation: Rapid institutionalisation by regional actors requires India to maintain nimble, well‑resourced analytic capacities in its missions and ministries to update policy lines promptly.

Research and verification checklist (key follow‑up questions)
- Which exact states’ heads of state validated the flag on 22 February 2025?
- Was a charter, treaty or statute published at or around the flag launch? If so, what are its provisions on membership, decision‑making and representative authority?
- Were visual specifications (colours, proportions, usage guidelines) formally released? Are they codified in a registry?
- How is the flag being used in practice (summits, official documents, military insignia, diplomatic missions)?
- What has been the reaction of regional organisations (African Union, ECOWAS) and key external partners (EU, France, Russia, China, India)?
- Is “Confederation of Sahel States” an alternative official name, a translation artifact, or indicative of an aspiration to a particular institutional form?
- Have any operational arrangements (joint forces, logistics hubs, basing agreements) been announced alongside or after the flag launch?

Concluding observation
The 22 February 2025 flag launch is a telling instance of how states and regional groupings use symbols to institutionalise political projects. For regional actors it can be a step toward deeper integration and operational coordination; for external powers, including India, it is an indicator that merits careful verification and calibrated policy responses. In the study of strategic culture, such acts combine semiotics and statecraft: they reveal intent, ambition and the pathways through which new political realities are produced and normalised.

### Case Study: The Alliance of Sahel States’ Proposed Joint Force — A Comparative Lesson for Indian Strategic Culture

Introduction and summary
- In January 2025 Niger’s Minister of Defence, Salifou Modi, stated that a previously announced joint military force for the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) is “in development.” The force is planned at roughly 5,000 personnel and is explicitly intended to conduct cross‑border counter‑terrorist operations against Islamist groups across the three AES members (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger).  
- The announcement marks a salient instance of three militarily governed Sahel states attempting to institutionalise transnational military cooperation in a high‑intensity, irregular conflict environment. For students of Indian strategic culture, the AES case offers a compact example of how states with overlapping security threats try to reconcile sovereignty, operational necessity and external geopolitical pressures when forming joint forces.

Why the force was proposed: strategic rationale
- The AES joint force is rooted in a shared threat perception. Islamist insurgent groups—most prominently Jama’at Nasr al‑Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS), among local affiliates—operate fluidly across porous borders. The states involved see the insurgency as transnational by design; unilateral national responses are perceived as insufficient because militants exploit border gaps to evade pursuit, reconstitute safe havens, and shift attack vectors.
- Politically, the force is also an instrument of regime consolidation and signalling. Military governments in the three states seek to demonstrate capacity and resolve to domestic constituencies and to external audiences, while simultaneously creating a framework less dependent on former external security partners whose presence has diminished or become contentious.
- From a doctrinal angle, the force embodies a shift from territorially bound counter‑insurgency to a mobility‑focused, cross‑border interdiction posture — prioritising rapid reaction, area denial and joint targeting over protracted hold‑and‑clear operations.

Operational design: size, composition and mismatch with mission scale
- The announced size (≈5,000 personnel) is significant politically but is modest operationally relative to the geographic scope — vast arid zones, limited infrastructure, and dispersed population centres across three countries. Effectiveness will depend critically on force composition: a disproportionate infantry presence without aviation, logistics, intelligence and medical assets will struggle to project sustained influence over the territory contested by insurgents.
- The distinction between “numbers” and “capability” matters: a 5,000-strong force that includes meaningful aviation lift (rotary and fixed wing), intelligence‑surveillance‑reconnaissance (ISR) assets, special operations, logistics and medical evacuation capacity could achieve decisive local effects. Conversely, a force lacking those enablers risks becoming another mobile but thinly resourced column, easily attrited or outmaneuvered.

Command and control, legal authority and rules of engagement
- AES operational effectiveness hinges on an explicit chain of command and legal mandate. Key unresolved questions include: will the force operate under a unified joint commander or rotating national commands? Will there be a single joint rules of engagement and detention policy, or will national caveats prevail?
- Cross‑border operations raise sovereignty issues. Even coordinated intervention among treaty partners requires domestic legal authorisation, clear basing and transit agreements, and mechanisms for national parliamentary or executive oversight. Without transparent legal foundations, the force could create domestic legitimacy problems for participating governments and provoke diplomatic friction with neighbouring states and regional bodies.

Interoperability and institutional integration challenges
- Interoperability is not merely about matching calibres of weapons; it requires harmonised communications systems, common operating procedures, shared training standards, logistics harmonisation, and language‑enabled liaison structures. The three militaries have divergent equipment profiles, maintenance chains and tactical doctrines. Achieving operational coherence will demand sustained joint training, common SOPs, and investment in communications and logistics interoperability.
- Time and resources are also required to build trust and shared situational awareness among commanders accustomed to national, not joint, operational cultures.

Logistics, sustainment and the geography problem
- The Sahel presents acute logistical challenges: long distances, limited all‑weather roads, sparse logistics hubs, and extreme climatic variation. A force that lacks prepositioned supplies, reliable fuel chains, maintenance facilities and medical evacuation capacity will be operationally fragile.
- Effective basing options — forward operating bases, aerial hubs, repair depots — must be identified and politically negotiated. The speed, endurance and persistence of operations will be constrained primarily by logistics rather than by tactical proficiency alone.

Intelligence sharing and joint targeting
- Cross‑border counter‑terrorism necessitates robust intelligence fusion: shared human intelligence nets, signals intelligence interoperability, common geospatial products and synchronised targeting cycles. Fragmented intelligence sharing or national “holdbacks” will undercut the joint force’s ability to interdict insurgent movement and leadership effectively.
- Establishing secure, multilayered liaison networks between national intelligence services, militaries and any external partners (including UN or bilateral advisers) is a prerequisite for coherent joint targeting and time‑sensitive operations.

Humanitarian risks and the human‑rights dimension
- Intensified cross‑border operations increase the risk of civilian harm, displacement and human‑rights abuses — particularly where command and control, oversight and training on international humanitarian law are weak. Perceptions of indiscriminate force can drive local populations toward insurgents or complicate access for humanitarian agencies.
- Robust safeguards are therefore imperative: explicit rules of engagement protecting civilians, independent monitoring mechanisms, transparent incident reporting, and channels for redress. Absent such safeguards, domestic and international delegitimisation risks will grow.

Geopolitics, external actors and patronage networks
- AES operations do not occur in a geopolitical vacuum. The Sahel’s security landscape has been reshaped by the decline of traditional European (notably French) military presence, the increased visibility of Russian state influence and private military companies, and the variegated stances of international actors. These external vectors affect supply options, training partnerships, and public legitimacy.
- For AES, reliance on non‑Western partners or private military contractors introduces questions of command influence, transparency and long‑term strategic alignment. International partners’ willingness to fund, equip or advise the joint force will likely be conditioned on political recognition, human‑rights assurances and regional stability objectives.

Funding, training and sustainability
- The joint force’s sustainability depends on a stable funding model: direct national budgets, pooled AES funding, or external assistance. Given constrained fiscal capacity, the most probable near‑term model will be heavy reliance on national resources and selective external support — a mix that may yield capability gaps and unequal burden‑sharing.
- Training pipelines are essential. Short‑term cobbling together of units for parade ground effect will not create an integrated expeditionary capability. Long‑term effectiveness requires institutionalised joint training centres, combined exercises, doctrine development and professionalisation of logistics and intelligence cadres.

Timeline, deliverables and implementation gaps
- “In development” is a status indicator rather than a deployment schedule. Key missing deliverables include basing plans, command headquarters, doctrinal manuals, interoperable communications architecture, sustained logistics plans and clear benchmarks for readiness. Without timetable and milestones, political expectations may outpace operational reality.

Risks of fragmentation and mission overlap
- The AES force faces a crowded theatre: national military operations, UN or regional peace operations (where present), and non‑state armed groups operate in the same space. Without robust deconfliction mechanisms and situational transparency, the risk of operational friction, duplication of effort, and even friendly fire incidents increases.

Potential benefits if adequately resourced and governed
- If properly resourced and governed, a joint AES force could close operational seams exploited by militants, increase the speed of cross‑border response, concentrate scarce assets for decisive actions, and project a unified deterrent posture that complicates insurgent operational planning.
- Institutionalising joint planning can also deliver longer‑term benefits in professionalisation, doctrine harmonisation and regional political coordination.

Lessons for Indian strategic culture and policy implications
- Sovereignty and non‑intervention: AES illustrates the tension between respect for sovereignty and the practical need for cross‑border action against transnational threats. India’s strategic culture — which values sovereignty and legal legitimacy — can draw from AES the importance of formalised legal frameworks when considering regional security cooperation, including basing or cross‑border contingency planning with partners.
- Multilateralism vs. ad hoc coalitions: The AES case shows both the strengths (shared threat focus) and pitfalls (institutional weaknesses) of a small, politically cohesive security coalition. India’s preference for multilateralism (e.g., regional forums, UN mandates) suggests it would likely favour operational mechanisms with clearer legal and institutional accountability rather than ad hoc military pacts.
- Interoperability and capacity building as prerequisites: AES’s challenges underscore that the mere declaration of a force is insufficient; capacity building, doctrine harmonisation, and logistics are decisive. India’s security assistance and capacity‑building programs (e.g., training, equipment support) in the Indian Ocean region and neighbourhood could emphasise these hard enablers rather than symbolic troop commitments.
- External partnerships and risk management: AES demonstrates how external actors’ involvement can be both enabling and politicising. India’s engagements should calibrate partnerships to preserve strategic autonomy, avoid overdependence on single external patrons, and insist on transparency and accountability measures for any defence cooperation.
- Human‑rights and legitimacy: The AES experience highlights reputational risks from heavy‑handed operations. For India, which seeks a responsible role in global security, integrating human‑rights safeguards into any support for regional security initiatives is both ethically and strategically prudent.

Conclusion
The AES proposed joint force is a concentrated illustration of contemporary dilemmas in regional security cooperation: shared threats prompting multilateral military solutions; the gulf between political announcement and operational readiness; and the interplay of local needs, legal sovereignty, logistics, interoperability and great‑power competition. For Indian strategic culture, AES provides a cautionary and instructive case: the utility of collective defence is real, but its success depends on legal legitimacy, institutionalised interoperability, sustainable logistics, robust intelligence fusion, and safeguards for civilian protection. These are the variables Indian policy should prioritise when shaping India’s own regional security engagements or when assisting partner states confronting transnational insurgencies.

### 5 February 2025: a “historic” convention on a common cultural policy — overview

On 5 February 2025 the Member States of the self‑described Confederation of Sahel States signed a convention establishing a common cultural policy. The act has been framed in political messaging as “historic,” a term that signals more than legal change: it is a marker of symbolic intent, political ambition and an attempt to shape regional identity and behaviour. This section situates that event analytically: it reconstructs the likely content and mechanisms of such a convention, identifies practical and political implications for implementation, situates the measure in regional and international context, and draws out the relevance of the development for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. The organisational actor: the Confederation of Sahel States

- Nature and status: The convention is attributed to the Member States of the Confederation of Sahel States. At the analytical stage it is important to treat the Confederation both as a political project and as an institutional actor whose legal status, membership roster and capacity deserve verification. Some regional arrangements in the Sahel have taken fluid, ad hoc forms; others have formal secretariats and treaty bases. Determining whether the Confederation is a fully institutionalised body, a loose political alignment, or a hybrid (treaty plus de facto coordination) matters for expectations about implementation and enforcement.
- Political significance: Whether or not its institutional architecture is deep, the Confederation represents an attempt to consolidate regional cooperation across states facing common security, developmental and governance challenges. A cultural policy convention is therefore best read as part of a broader strategy to build cohesion among governments and publics in a difficult operating environment.

2. Purpose and likely scope of a “common cultural policy”

A convention establishing a common cultural policy normally covers several interlocking domains. The following elements are likely to be either explicit provisions or implicit policy areas requiring subsequent regulation and programming:

- Heritage protection and management: harmonised approaches to protecting tangible (archaeological sites, monuments) and intangible (oral traditions, performing arts) heritage; joint inventories; cross‑border heritage zones.
- Arts and creative industries: mechanisms for supporting artists, copyright harmonisation, regional festivals, co‑production of films and music, market access for cultural goods and services.
- Language and education policy: promotion of shared languages, multilingual education frameworks, safeguarding of minority languages, cultural content in curricula.
- Cultural exchange and mobility: visas and travel facilitation for artists and cultural professionals, residency programmes, exchange of cultural practitioners and students.
- Promotion of regional identity: public diplomacy campaigns, joint branding for tourism and cultural goods, shared symbols or commemorations.
- Media and digital culture: regional platforms for content distribution, joint strategies to counter violent extremist narratives, digital archives and cultural data sharing.

3. Practical and legal implications for member states

- Ratification and domestic incorporation: The convention will typically require national ratification and the enactment of implementing legislation or executive measures. The pace and fidelity of implementation will depend on domestic political priorities and capacity.
- Institutional architecture: The convention will likely create or designate a coordinating body — a cultural secretariat, a committee of ministers, or a specialised agency — responsible for policy harmonisation, project management and external partnerships.
- Budgetary and financing arrangements: Effective policy requires funding. The convention may set out contributions, create a pooled fund, or rely on project‑based financing from donors and development banks.
- Legal harmonisation: Member states will face the task of aligning copyright laws, heritage protection statutes and cultural industry regulations to enable cross‑border cooperation and enforce common standards.
- Monitoring and dispute‑settlement: Conventions often establish reporting mechanisms and sometimes dispute‑resolution provisions; the strength of these will determine the convention’s enforceability.

4. Strategic aims: why a cultural policy matters in the Sahel

- Regional cohesion and legitimacy: By cultivating a sense of shared heritage and identity, the convention can strengthen intra‑regional legitimacy at both elite and popular levels — an important resource where governance trust is fragile.
- Soft power and external projection: A coordinated cultural policy can boost the region’s ability to project a common narrative internationally, attract tourism, and shape how external actors engage with the Sahel.
- Social resilience and countering violent narratives: Cultural programmes can form part of resilience strategies against violent extremism by reinforcing non‑violent identities and offering platforms for alternative forms of social and economic expression.
- Economic stimulus: Creative industries and cultural tourism, if developed coherently, can create livelihoods and diversify local economies — a strategic complement to security and development interventions.
- Diplomatic leverage: A regional cultural identity can serve as a diplomatic resource in negotiations with neighbouring states and external partners.

5. Implementation challenges and constraints

- Divergent national priorities: States in the Sahel often face competing immediate priorities (security, humanitarian crises, governance transitions) that can deprioritise cultural programming.
- Resource constraints: Cultural policy requires sustained financing; resource‑poor states may struggle to fund commitments without external assistance.
- Political instability and security risks: Conflict and instability impede project delivery, limit mobility of artists and cultural managers, and can make heritage protection physically dangerous.
- Legal and administrative heterogeneity: Disparities in legal regimes and bureaucratic capacity complicate harmonisation of copyright, heritage law and education policy.
- External competition and politicisation: External patrons (former colonial powers, regional powers, emerging donors) may compete to shape cultural initiatives, creating tensions or perceptions of instrumentalisation.
- Symbolic vs. material implementation gap: Declaring a “historic” policy is not the same as operationalising it across ministries, local authorities and civil society.

6. Regional and international context: partners and pressures

- UNESCO and cultural governance: UNESCO is a natural technical partner for heritage protection, inventories, capacity building and normative standards; its engagement can lend expertise and legitimacy.
- Donors and development banks: The EU, bilateral donors, the World Bank and regional development banks can provide financing and programme support, typically conditional on governance and institutional safeguards.
- External power competition: Cultural policy in the Sahel does not occur in a geopolitical vacuum. France, Russia, China, Turkey, Gulf states and others have active cultural diplomacy and media strategies in Africa; a regional cultural policy can become a site of competition or cooperation with these actors.
- Links to security cooperation: Given the Sahel’s critical security dynamics, cultural programmes will intersect with counter‑radicalisation, DDR (disarmament, demobilisation, reintegration) and community stabilisation efforts.

7. Next analytical steps (recommended monitoring and research)

To understand the convention’s real implications, analysts should:
- Confirm membership and legal status: obtain an authoritative list of signatory states and the Confederation’s treaty status.
- Obtain and analyse the full convention text: identify binding obligations, institutional design, financing provisions, and timelines.
- Track national ratification processes and domestic implementing legislation.
- Map institutional actors: which ministry or secretariat will lead, and what mandate is given to civil society or private sector partners.
- Monitor initial programmes and budgets: early project choices indicate priorities and capacity.
- Observe external partnerships and funding: who provides technical and financial support, under what conditions.
- Assess public reception: media, cultural sector stakeholders and community responses indicate legitimacy and likely social impact.

8. Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

While the convention is a regional Sahelian development, it has several bearings for Indian strategic interests and for comparative learning about culture–security linkages:

- Strategic openings for Indian soft power: India has a long tradition of cultural diplomacy (Indianness, language, Bollywood, educational exchanges). A coordinated Sahel cultural policy opens possibilities for Indian cultural cooperation: scholarships, cultural centres, film festivals, training for cultural administrators, and collaboration in creative industries. Such engagement can complement India's broader engagement in Africa and counterbalance other external actors.
- Development and capacity‑building partnerships: India can offer technical assistance in cultural heritage conservation, museum management, and skills training in creative industries — areas where Indian institutions and civil society have relevant experience.
- Security and counter‑extremism linkages: Cultural programming that builds social resilience aligns with Indian experience in countering radicalisation through education and community engagement. India could contribute expertise on community‑based cultural initiatives tied to livelihoods.
- Economic diplomacy: Collaboration in cultural tourism, handicrafts, and audiovisual co‑production can create economic links that reinforce strategic partnerships.
- Caution on political risks: Indian engagement must navigate sensitivities — working with states whose governance records or security practices may be contested can create reputational and legal risks for Indian actors. New regional arrangements may entangle cultural programmes with political agendas or with external rivalries.
- Comparative lessons for India’s domestic policy: The Sahel initiative highlights how culture can be mobilised for cohesion and security. For Indian policymakers, the convention offers a comparative case on the limits of symbolic declarations versus the need for sustained financing, institutional capacity, and grassroots legitimacy.

Practical recommendations for Indian policymakers and analysts

- Rapidly obtain the convention text and membership list to assess opportunities and risks.
- Prioritise engagement modalities that combine cultural diplomacy with capacity building (scholarships, training for museum professionals, joint festivals) rather than one‑off symbolic gestures.
- Coordinate Indian outreach through multiple channels (MEA cultural wings, ICCR, Indian technical cooperation programmes) to ensure coherence.
- Monitor the roles of other external actors in the new regional architecture; calibrate India’s approach to avoid zero‑sum competition while protecting Indian strategic interests.
- Support multilateral technical partners (UNESCO) where possible to anchor programming in recognised norms and safeguards.
- Use the Sahel case as a laboratory for comparative research on culture as a tool of resilience and soft power; incorporate findings into Indian national security doctrine where appropriate.

Conclusion

A convention establishing a common cultural policy among Sahel states is simultaneously symbolic and potentially consequential. Its ultimate significance will be determined not by the rhetoric that accompanies signature ceremonies, but by the legal design, financing, institutional capacity and the political will of states to implement commitments under conditions of insecurity and scarce resources. For external actors — including India — the event presents both opportunities for constructive engagement through cultural diplomacy, and a set of governance and reputational challenges that require cautious, well‑coordinated responses. The analytical priority is therefore documentary and process‑focused: secure the convention text, track ratification and budgets, and monitor early programming to assess whether “historic” rhetoric translates into durable regional cultural cooperation.

## A Proposed Joint Parliament for the Sahel Confederation: Institutional Design, Risks, and Strategic Implications

This section examines an ongoing intergovernmental initiative by ministers of the Sahel Confederation (also referred to in some documents as the Alliance of Sahel States) to create a common, trilateral parliament for the confederation’s three member states. The analysis below expands the factual outline of the initiative into a structured assessment of purpose, institutional design choices, legal and operational requirements, likely challenges, and practical recommendations. Where relevant, I highlight implications and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy—both in terms of direct engagement opportunities and comparative institutional lessons drawn from India’s own regional diplomacy.

1. Executive summary
- Actors: Ministers from the three Sahel Confederation/Alliance member states are leading the initiative.
- Objective: To create a joint (common) parliament — a trilateral legislative or deliberative organ.
- Status: Initiative is under active negotiation; the body is not yet established.
- Institutional level: An intergovernmental undertaking within the Sahel regional framework.
- Central dilemma: Balancing deeper regional cooperation and democratic legitimacy against state sovereignty, resource constraints, and a volatile security environment.

2. Why a joint parliament? Purpose and expected functions
A joint parliament typically pursues several interlocking goals:
- Enhance regional coordination and policy coherence across transnational problems (security, migration, natural resources).
- Harmonize legislation to facilitate cooperation in trade, security, and rule-of-law matters.
- Provide democratic oversight (or at least political legitimacy) for regional executive organs and collective policies.
- Deepen political integration as a confidence-building measure and forum for dispute resolution.

For the Sahel context, the parliament’s potential functions could include:
- Legislative harmonization on security cooperation, border management, and counter-terrorism protocols.
- Oversight of joint military or policing initiatives and regional budgets.
- A platform for concerted policy responses to humanitarian crises and displacement.
- Symbolic consolidation of a political identity among member states to strengthen the confederation’s external posture.

3. Institutional options and core design questions
Design choices will materially determine both effectiveness and acceptability to national governments. Key questions and typical options are:

A. Mandate and competence
- Advisory body: Issues recommendations and opinions to member governments and the confederation’s executive organs.
- Supervisory/oversight body: Holds hearings, reviews regional budgets, monitors policy implementation.
- Legislative body: Enacts binding regional measures within enumerated competences (most politically sensitive; may require transfer of sovereignty).

B. Mode of representation
- Delegation of national parliamentarians (appointed): Easier politically, maintains linkage to national legislatures.
- Direct election (parliamentary members elected by citizens across the Sahel): Highest democratic legitimacy but demands robust electoral logistics and resources.
- Mixed model: Some seats filled by national delegates, some by direct election.

C. Seat allocation and voting rules
- Equal representation (one state, one vote): Protects smaller member-state equality; common in confederative arrangements.
- Population-proportionate representation: Reflects demographic weight but can be politically contentious.
- Voting thresholds: Simple majority for day-to-day business, qualified majority for core issues, national veto for sovereignty-sensitive matters.

D. Term lengths, immunity, and codes of conduct
- Should align with national parliamentary cycles where delegates are appointed; direct elections would require a new electoral calendar.
- Clear rules on parliamentary privilege, conflict of interest, and ethical conduct will be necessary for legitimacy.

4. Legal and constitutional requirements
- Founding instrument: A treaty, treaty protocol, or constitutional amendment will be necessary to create a parliament with formal competences.
- Ratification: National ratification procedures (parliamentary approval, referenda) will govern entry into force and can be time-consuming or politically fraught.
- Constitutional compatibility: Where parliamentary powers are supranational or binding, each state must reconcile the new body with constitutional limits on sovereignty and delegation of authority.
- Transitional arrangements: Provision for provisional modalities (interim secretariat, consultative assembly) can help commence cooperation while full ratification proceeds.

5. Operational and logistical considerations
Effective operation will require practical planning on:
- Headquarters: Criteria include neutrality, security, accessibility, and symbolic acceptability.
- Languages: Multilingual arrangements with robust translation services will be necessary in the Sahel’s linguistic environment.
- Budget and staffing: Clear contribution formula (per capita, equal shares, or assessed contributions) and donor engagement to compensate initial capacity gaps.
- Secretariat and committees: A permanent secretariat and standing committees (security, budget, legal affairs, social policy) are typical.
- Relations with executive organs: Define how the parliament interacts with the confederation’s executive council or heads of state—information flows, subpoena powers, and oversight mechanisms.

6. Sovereignty, legitimacy, and public buy-in
- Sovereignty trade-offs: Member states will be cautious about ceding binding authority. Defining a limited but meaningful competences list can reconcile integration with sovereign prerogatives.
- Democratic legitimacy: Direct elections offer superior legitimacy but are resource-intensive and politically demanding. Appointment by national parliaments preserves domestic control but risks perceptions of elitism or rubber-stamping.
- Transparency and inclusiveness: Public outreach, involvement of national parliaments and civil society, and phased rollouts will enhance legitimacy and popular acceptance.

7. Principal risks and constraints
- Ratification delays and political blockage: Slow or failed ratification can produce asymmetries and stall implementation.
- Divergent political systems: Heterogeneous regimes (civilian-led, military, transitional governments) among the three states can complicate cooperation and continuity.
- Resource and capacity shortages: Without predictable funding and administrative capacity, the parliament may be ineffective or tokenistic.
- Security instability: Ongoing insurgencies, terrorism, and humanitarian crises in parts of the Sahel may disrupt meetings, threaten staff security, and prioritize short-term security over institution-building.
- Institutional overlap: Potential duplication with other regional bodies (economic, security, or parliamentary networks) must be clarified to avoid jurisdictional conflict.

8. Recommendations and staged next steps
To increase the likelihood of a workable, legitimate institution, member states should consider a phased, pragmatic approach:

Phase 1 — Clarify political parameters and nomenclature
- Resolve naming and institutional identity (Sahel Confederation vs. Alliance of Sahel States) to prevent confusion in legal drafts and external diplomacy.
- Produce a short “statement of intent” defining the parliament’s preliminary mandate—advisory vs. legislative—and a roadmap with timelines.

Phase 2 — Founding instruments and constitutional vetting
- Draft a founding treaty/protocol with clear competence lists, ratification procedures, and dispute-resolution mechanisms.
- Conduct constitutional compatibility reviews in each state and establish minimal constitutional amendment packages where necessary.

Phase 3 — Interim modalities and capacity building
- Establish an interim consultative assembly composed of national parliamentarian delegates to meet regularly, build procedures, and draft standing orders.
- Set up a temporary secretariat with donor and partner support for institutional capacity-building, translation, and securitization planning.

Phase 4 — Decide on representation and electoral arrangements
- Choose a representation model that balances legitimacy with feasibility (e.g., initially appointed national delegations with a path toward partial direct elections).
- Agree on voting rules and protected competencies requiring higher thresholds or national vetoes.

Phase 5 — Logistics, budget, and external partnerships
- Agree on headquarters, staff recruitment, official languages, and a sustainable budget formula.
- Seek targeted technical assistance (parliamentary procedure, legislative drafting, security of officials) from international partners and parliamentary associations.

9. Implications for India: strategic posture and engagement opportunities
India’s strategic culture—characterized by cautious multilateralism, respect for sovereignty, and an emphasis on capacity-building cooperation—suggests several pathways for engagement with a nascent Sahel joint parliament:

A. Practical cooperation and capacity assistance
- Parliamentary diplomacy: India’s parliament has developed robust inter-parliamentary cooperation programs; these can be extended as technical assistance (training in legislative drafting, committee work, fiscal oversight).
- Capacity-building partnerships: India can offer training for secretariat staff, electoral administration advice (if the parliament moves toward direct elections), and public administration support.
- Security-sector links: Given India’s experience in peacekeeping and security training, cooperation on parliamentary oversight of security policy and civilian control of armed forces is feasible.

B. Policy and normative alignment
- India’s respect for sovereignty aligns with Sahel states’ likely preference for limited and consensual supranational powers. This normative compatibility facilitates trust-building.
- India can act as a neutral partner emphasizing institution-building rather than prescriptive governance reform, consistent with its non-interference posture.

C. Strategic interests
- Stability in the Sahel matters for global security and for India’s broader engagement with Africa—countering violent extremism, protecting maritime routes (in adjacent West African littorals), and ensuring safe environments for economic projects.
- Engagement provides India diplomatic visibility and builds coalitions in multilateral fora (e.g., UNSC, G77) by supporting African-owned solutions.

D. Cautions for Indian policymakers
- Security fragility may make sustained on-the-ground engagement costly and risky—partnerships should prioritize remote capacity-building and multilateral donor platforms.
- India should be careful not to appear to favor particular political factions within member states; impartiality will preserve long-term access.

10. Comparative lessons from India’s regional engagements
India’s experience with regional architectures (SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA) offers useful lessons:
- Patience and phased approaches: India’s sectional experience shows that slow, incremental institutionalization often preserves sovereignty while producing tangible cooperation.
- Linking national parliaments to regional processes enhances legitimacy: Parliamentary diplomacy and parliamentary committees foster cross-border norms and legislative harmonization.
- Operational capacity is decisive: Institutions with inadequate budgets and unclear secretariats struggle to influence policy; early emphasis on sustainable financing matters.

11. Terminology note and political semantics
- The drafting process must resolve whether “Sahel Confederation” and “Alliance of Sahel States” are synonymous or represent distinct legal-political constructs. Ambiguity in nomenclature can create interpretive disputes in treaty law, hinder external relations, and complicate ratification. A concise legal identity and branding strategy should be part of the initial drafting package.

12. Concluding assessment
A joint parliament for the Sahel Confederation has the potential to strengthen regional policy coherence and provide a forum for democratic oversight of collective action. Yet its success depends on careful institutional design that balances legitimacy and feasibility, clear legal foundations compatible with national constitutions, predictable funding, and realistic expectations given the security environment. For external actors such as India, targeted, non-intrusive capacity-building and parliamentary diplomacy are the most appropriate forms of engagement—consistent with India’s strategic culture and room for constructive support of African-led institutional solutions.

Practical checklist for negotiators (summary)
- Define mandate (advisory, oversight, or legislative) and list exclusive/ shared competences.
- Choose representation model and set voting thresholds.
- Draft a founding treaty with ratification timelines and transitional arrangements.
- Establish an interim assembly and secretariat supported by a donor partnership for initial costs.
- Clarify headquarters, official languages, budget formula, and committee structure.
- Engage national parliaments, civil society, and international partners to bolster legitimacy and capacity.

This analytical framework is meant to guide policymakers, parliamentary drafters, and external partners as they move from political intent to operational reality. The recommended phased, inclusive approach seeks to reconcile the imperative for stronger regional coordination in the Sahel with the political and constitutional realities of member states—while offering constructive entry points for partners like India that favor institution-building over intervention.

## Judicial Cooperation and the Proposed Regional Criminal Court of the Alliance of Sahel States

On a May 2025 ministerial meeting, the member states of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) — convened under the chairmanship of Mali’s Prime Minister General Abdoulaye Maïga — agreed to establish a regional criminal court and ancillary judicial cooperation mechanisms. That decision is a major institutional innovation in the Sahel: it signals a regional move from exclusively security‑centric coordination toward the formalization of juridical responses to transnational threats such as terrorism, violent extremism and serious human rights violations. This section analyses the proposal in detail, highlights design and implementation imperatives, assesses attendant political and operational risks, compares relevant precedents, and draws specific implications for external partners — including India — whose strategic approaches to foreign security cooperation and rule‑of‑law assistance are shaped by particular norms and preferences.

Background and stated purpose
- Meeting: AES ministers, May 2025; chaired by Malian Prime Minister General Abdoulaye Maïga.
- Purpose: Create judicial cooperation mechanisms and a regional criminal court to tackle transnational problems — specifically insecurity, arms proliferation and money laundering — and to strengthen governance and institutional stability across member states.
- Approach to harmonization: The AES aims to enhance judicial convergence and inter‑operability rather than to fully unify national legal systems.
- Institutional outcomes: Decision to create a regional criminal court for terrorism, violent extremism and human rights violations; plan for a high‑security prison built to “international standards.” The court’s seat has not yet been chosen.

Mandate scope and jurisdictional design issues
A credible regional court requires clarity on three dimensions of jurisdiction: subject‑matter, temporal and personal scope.
- Subject‑matter: The AES has identified terrorism, violent extremism and human rights violations. The statute must define these offences precisely (e.g., terrorism versus armed rebellion, classification of violent extremist acts, definitions of crimes against humanity and war crimes) to avoid ambiguity and arbitrary application.
- Temporal jurisdiction: The court should delimit whether it will have retrospective jurisdiction over acts committed prior to its creation and, if so, the limits for prosecutions to prevent ex post facto problems and political abuse.
- Personal jurisdiction: The statute must state if it will extend to persons with official immunity (heads of state, ministers, military commanders), mercenaries, non‑state actors and foreign personnel. The greatest political friction will likely concern whether sitting leaders or commanders are subject to prosecution; frameworks range from complete exclusion of immunities to conditional waivers and referral mechanisms.
Recommendation: Draft drafters should adopt clear, narrow definitions and build in referral and deferral procedures rather than broad, open‑ended language that invites politicization.

Relationship to national courts and the principle of complementarity
The AES approach of interoperability rather than full legal unification implies a complementarity model. Mechanisms to articulate relations between the regional court and national courts will be central.
- Complementarity vs primacy: The statute can follow an ICC‑style complementarity (regional court acts when national systems are unwilling/unable) or adopt a primacy model that allows the regional court to derogate national jurisdiction in specified cases. Complementarity better preserves state sovereignty but needs detailed admissibility criteria.
- Mutual recognition and enforcement: Since laws remain national, mutual recognition instruments (arrest warrants, judgments, evidence sharing) and uniform admissibility rules are needed.
- Transfer and deferral procedures: The court should define when and how cases are transferred from domestic jurisdictions, including safeguards for due process and prevention of forum shopping.

Interaction with regional and international institutions
Coordination with the African Union (AU), regional economic communities (ECOWAS, ECCAS where applicable), the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) is essential to avoid jurisdictional conflicts and secure legitimacy.
- AU relationship: A formal relationship with the AU will shield the court politically and facilitate recognition across the continent; AU endorsement could also ease donor and partner engagement.
- ICC and other tribunals: The AES statute must clarify the relationship with the ICC (e.g., non‑duplication, referral, cooperation) to prevent parallel investigations and double jeopardy concerns.
- Regional courts and human rights bodies: Coordination with the African Court and national constitutional courts is necessary to maintain human rights oversight and appeals pathways.

Extradition, surrender and custody arrangements
Operational success depends on practical transfer mechanisms.
- Extradition treaties: AES members will need either a single multilateral surrender instrument or harmonized bilateral treaties covering arrest, secure transfer, custody and transit procedures.
- Secure transport and custody: Standardized protocols for transport and interim detention, chain‑of‑custody rules and coordinated security escort arrangements are required.
- Immunities and protective arrangements: Clarify procedures when suspects claim immunity and include mechanisms for temporary waivers or domestic accountability processes.

Evidence standards, prosecutions and mutual legal assistance
Interoperability requires shared protocols and capacity for cross‑border investigations.
- Evidence collection and chain‑of‑custody: Adopt uniform evidentiary standards and digital forensics protocols that national systems can meet.
- Mutual legal assistance (MLA): The court should be supported by a treaty‑level MLA regime covering criminal records, financial information, ballistic and communications data, and witness protection cooperation.
- Witness protection and victim participation: Strong, cross‑border witness protection mechanisms are necessary to ensure testimony integrity and to secure cooperation from communities.

Fair trial safeguards and human rights protections
For credibility and donor confidence, the court must guarantee due process.
- Judicial independence: Transparent selection processes for judges and prosecutors, secure tenure, and an independent registry must be institutionalized.
- Appeals and review: Provide internal appellate mechanisms and define pathways to regional human rights bodies.
- Legal aid and victim rights: Ensure effective legal aid for defendants and structured avenues for victim participation and reparations.

Custodial infrastructure and prison standards
AES proposals for a high‑security prison must reflect international norms.
- International standards: The prison design and operation should conform to the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (the Mandela Rules), the Bangkok Rules for women prisoners, and human rights monitoring frameworks.
- Independent monitoring: Establishment of independent oversight (ombudsman, international observers) and routine inspection mechanisms is vital to prevent abuse, radicalization in custody, and to maintain the court’s legitimacy.
- Rehabilitation and reintegration: Facilities should incorporate rehabilitation programs and structured reintegration planning that meet international best practices.

Security, location and political acceptability
Selecting a seat for the court blends practical, security and political considerations.
- Security vs access: A secure, neutral location with robust infrastructure and international connectivity is necessary but must also be accessible to victims, defense counsel and witnesses.
- Neutrality and host‑state suitability: Host selection should minimize perceptions of political bias and be accepted by all members; host agreements must guarantee privileges, immunities and security guarantees.
- Protection from external threats: The court and prison must be designed to resist regional instability and potential cross‑border attacks.

Funding, capacity and technology
Sustainability and operational capacity are central to effectiveness.
- Financing: A mixed model of member contributions, AU backing and international donor funding is likely. Predictable, long‑term funding is preferable to ad hoc donor reliance.
- Staffing and training: Recruitment of impartial judicial staff and wide‑ranging training (investigation, prosecution, defense, forensic sciences) will be needed; secondment schemes from partner states and international organizations can supply initial expertise.
- ICT and secure communications: Investment in secure digital case management, evidence storage and communication networks is essential, with attention to cybersecurity.

Enforcement capacity and cooperation with security forces
The court’s writ will be meaningful only insofar as states enforce its orders.
- Arrest and execution powers: The court will rely on member states’ police and military for arrest warrants and enforcement; formalized operational coordination channels are necessary.
- International assistance: Where domestic capabilities are weak, strategic partners and international organizations may be asked to assist in extradition and secure transport.
- Risk of non‑compliance: Mechanisms for responding to non‑cooperation (sanctions, political pressure, AU mediation) should be pre‑agreed.

Political risks, legitimacy and perceptions of selectivity
The AES court faces significant political challenges if not carefully designed.
- Politicization: Risk that prosecutions become instruments of political repression; transparency and robust admissibility criteria mitigate this danger.
- Sovereignty concerns: Members may perceive encroachment on sovereignty; complementarity and clear referral triggers reduce resistance.
- Domestic backlash: Perceptions of foreign imposition or lack of local ownership can provoke nationalist backlash; broad stakeholder engagement is essential.

Comparative models and applied lessons
The architects of the AES court can learn from hybrid and international tribunals.
- Special Court for Sierra Leone: Demonstrates how a regional/international hybrid can combine local legitimacy with international expertise; financing and long‑term sustainability remain issues.
- Extraordinary Chambers and hybrid courts (e.g., Kosovo Specialist Chambers): Offer lessons on protecting rule of law while managing political sensitivity and protecting witnesses.
- International Criminal Court: Provides a complementarity framework, but its political entanglements illustrate the risks of perceived selectivity.
Lesson: Avoid overdependence on external funding, design transparent recruitment, and embed strong human rights safeguards from inception.

Timeline, legal steps and implementation milestones
A realistic sequence to operationalize the court:
1. Draft and adopt statute with precise jurisdictional clauses and complementarity rules.
2. Decide the seat, conclude host agreements and define immunities and privileges.
3. Ratify the statute through domestic parliamentary processes in member states.
4. Establish transitional bodies (preliminary registry, provisional prosecutors) and recruit judicial officers via transparent procedures.
5. Negotiate multilateral extradition, MLA and transfer protocols; build secure transport and detention arrangements.
6. Construct/upgrade custodial facility to international standards and set monitoring frameworks.
7. Stabilize sustainable financing and launch capacity‑building programs for national judicial and investigative institutions.

Stakeholder engagement and legitimacy building
For long‑term acceptance the AES court must be perceived as fair, independent and rooted in local needs.
- Civil society and victims’ groups: Involve them in statute drafting, restorative justice mechanisms and outreach to communities affected by conflict.
- Regional human rights institutions: Formal cooperation agreements with the African Court and national human rights commissions strengthen protections.
- International partners: Solicit technical support (forensics, ICT, training) while preserving regional ownership to avoid dependency and legitimacy deficits.

Operational recommendation (core priorities)
- Prioritise a narrowly drafted statute with explicit complementarity criteria and robust admissibility tests to guard against politicization.
- Insist on transparent procedures for judicial appointments and case selection.
- Establish a durable financing model combining member contributions and multiyear donor commitments with auditing and accountability measures.
- Build custodial facilities to Mandela Rule standards, with independent oversight and rehabilitation programs.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
India’s strategic culture — marked by a preference for state sovereignty, legalism, capacity building, non‑alignment and selective multilateral engagement — shapes how New Delhi might view and engage with the AES initiative. The following points summarise relevant implications and options for Indian policy:

1. Principles and posture
- India will likely be sympathetic to rule‑of‑law solutions to terrorism and transnational crime, but cautious about interventions that are perceived to infringe on sovereignty or become politicized.
- New Delhi’s engagement would emphasise capacity building, legal cooperation, and technical assistance rather than leadership of prosecutorial or operational enforcement roles.

2. Opportunities for Indian contribution
- Technical assistance: India can offer judicial training (for prosecutors, defenders, judges), forensic capacity building, cyber‑forensics training, and police investigation techniques drawn from its own counterterrorism and criminal justice experience.
- Legal cooperation: Support drafting of statutes, mutual legal assistance instruments and extradition templates, leveraging Indian experience in treaty negotiation and multilingual legal drafting.
- Prison management: Provide advisory support on custodial standards, rehabilitation programs, medical care, and vocational training for detainees; Indian prison administration has experience managing large, resource‑constrained systems.
- Capacity sharing and secondments: Offer short‑term secondments of judicial clerks, forensic experts and registry staff, and training exchanges with Indian law schools and forensic institutes.
- Multilateral advocacy: Use India’s presence in the AU partnership forums, the UN and other multilateral venues to advocate for donor coordination and technical assistance that respects AES ownership.

3. Risks for Indian engagement
- Perception risk: Close association with a court that becomes politicized could damage India’s image as a neutral partner. India should condition assistance on transparent safeguards and independent oversight.
- Resource constraints: India must balance commitments in the Sahel with competing priorities in Africa (e.g., East Africa) and its domestic capacity to provide sustained assistance.
- Legal compatibility: India must ensure any cooperation (e.g., evidence sharing, extradition assistance) obeys its domestic law, human rights obligations and international treaty commitments.

4. Policy prescriptions for New Delhi
- Adopt a principle of conditional, capacity‑building engagement: Offer technical and legal assistance tied to demonstrable safeguards (transparent appointments, human‑rights monitoring).
- Promote AU and regional coordination: Encourage AES to coordinate with the AU and ECOWAS/ECCAS to ensure broader legitimacy and avoid fragmentation.
- Support peer‑review and independent monitoring: Advocate for mechanisms (AU observers, independent monitoring bodies) to protect due process and credibility.
- Provide selective financial and technical aid: Prioritise investments in forensics, witness protection, digital evidence handling and judicial training that have high leverage for prosecutorial quality.
- Use multilateral channels: Pool efforts with EU, UN and other partners for donor coordination and to avoid overdependence on a single external sponsor.

Conclusion
The AES decision to create a regional criminal court and complementary judicial cooperation architecture is an important, potentially transformative step for law‑based responses to insecurity in the Sahel. Its success will hinge on careful statutory design, robust complementarity mechanisms, inter‑institutional coordination (AU, ICC, regional bodies), adherence to international human rights and prison standards, sustainable financing and strong stakeholder engagement. For external actors such as India, the safest and most effective posture is one of principled, capacity‑based support conditioned on transparent safeguards: helping to build indigenous judicial capacity that strengthens both regional security and rule‑of‑law resilience without supplanting regional ownership.

### APSA‑Sahel: Regional Seed Sovereignty and Its Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Introduction  
The Alliance of Agricultural Seed Producers of the Sahel (APSA‑Sahel) is a recent initiative announced under the auspices of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES). It is designed to reconfigure seed systems across the Sahel—an arid to semi‑arid band of West and Central Africa—by prioritising locally adapted, indigenous varieties, strengthening regional production and distribution, and reducing dependence on imported seed. As a policy innovation, APSA‑Sahel exemplifies how regional organisations attempt to blend food sovereignty objectives, agrobiodiversity conservation, and resilience building in the face of climate variability. For scholars of strategic culture and national security policy, APSA‑Sahel is also analytically important: it intersects food security, developmental statecraft, regional governance, and geopolitical competition—domains increasingly central to India’s external engagement and security calculus.

1. What APSA‑Sahel is and why it matters  
- Identity and sponsorship: APSA‑Sahel (Alliance of Agricultural Seed Producers of the Sahel) has been created under AES—indicating that it is a regionally backed, state‑level initiative rather than a purely private or NGO programme. That political backing shapes its mandate, resources and regional legitimacy.  
- Primary objective: to strengthen regional food sovereignty by promoting seed systems that are adapted to the Sahel’s specific ecological and socio‑economic conditions. Food sovereignty, as emphasised in the initiative, means devolving the control of seed choice and breeding decisions to farmers and communities, not merely securing food supply.  
- Core focus: locally adapted seed systems—those that deliver drought tolerance, early maturity, pest and disease resilience, and farmers’ preferred qualities (taste, storability, cultural traits). Supporting such systems is aimed at reducing reliance on foreign seed imports and enhancing supply‑chain resilience during periods of market disruption or geopolitical stress.

2. Sahel context: why local seeds are strategic infrastructure  
- Climatic reality: the Sahel is characterised by erratic rainfall, recurrent droughts, soil degradation and increasing climate variability. These conditions make exogenously developed, one‑size‑fits‑all varieties less reliable; locally adapted germplasm is critical for resilience.  
- Agrobiodiversity and resilience: indigenous varieties often embody adaptations to local microclimates and pests, derived from long periods of farmer selection. Conserving and scaling such varieties preserves genetic resources that are strategically important under climate change.  
- Socio‑economic dynamics: seed systems in the Sahel are tightly linked to livelihood security, local markets and social norms (seed exchange, community banks). Strengthening these systems has direct implications for rural stability and food availability—factors that feed into national and regional security.

3. Planned activities and institutional implications  
APSA‑Sahel’s planned activities (seed research, production and distribution) imply a multifaceted institutional agenda:
- Research and breeding: support for participatory plant breeding that blends formal science with farmer knowledge; prioritisation of climate‑resilient traits.  
- Multiplication and production: decentralised seed multiplication—community seed banks and local seed enterprises—rather than centralised, export‑oriented production.  
- Certification and quality control: investment in seed testing laboratories, regional quality standards and training to ensure germination rates and varietal integrity.  
- Distribution and extension: building storage, logistics and extension networks to move seed to remote and conflict‑affected areas in timely windows.  
These elements require coordinated financing, sustained technical capacity and regulatory alignment across Sahelian states.

4. Strategic outcomes APSA‑Sahel seeks to achieve  
- Reduced import dependence: lowering foreign exchange outflows and vulnerability to global market shocks.  
- Enhanced food sovereignty: empowering farmers and communities with control over seed choices and breeding priorities.  
- Preservation and use of agrobiodiversity: maintaining varietal richness that underpins long‑term adaptive capacity.  
- Local economic development: creating livelihoods through local seed enterprises and decentralised value chains.

5. Risks, constraints and governance dilemmas  
Establishing a regional seed alliance is technically and politically challenging:
- Financing: effective research, infrastructure and capacity building require sustained funding beyond one‑off donor projects. Political commitment across AES members is essential.  
- Regulatory complexity: harmonising seed laws, variety registration, phytosanitary requirements and certification regimes across multiple sovereign states is legally and administratively demanding.  
- Intellectual property tensions: promoting farmer‑managed indigenous varieties can clash with commercial seed companies and international IPR regimes. The risk of biopiracy or private appropriation of local germplasm must be managed through benefit‑sharing and legal safeguards.  
- Quality assurance: scaling up community seed systems while maintaining varietal purity and germination performance is technically intensive.  
- Security and logistics: ongoing conflict, weak transport infrastructure and seasonal access restrict distribution in large parts of the Sahel.  
- Adoption barriers: farmers often require complementary services—credit, extension, market links—to adopt new or improved seed systems.

6. Opportunities, policy design features and best practices  
Lessons from both development practice and seed‑system science point to a set of pragmatic measures APSA‑Sahel should adopt:
- Participatory plant breeding: co‑development of varieties with farmers accelerates local relevance and adoption.  
- Decentralised multiplication: support community seed banks and local seed enterprises to build supply where it is most needed and to generate rural employment.  
- Regional policy harmonisation: align variety registration, phytosanitary rules and movement protocols to ease cross‑border flows and reduce duplication.  
- Partnership with research networks: collaborate with CGIAR centres and regional institutes (notably ICRISAT, which has extensive Sahel programmes) to access germplasm and technical expertise.  
- Legal protections for farmer rights: enshrine benefit‑sharing mechanisms and safeguards against misappropriation of indigenous varieties.  
- Climate‑smart trait prioritisation: target drought tolerance, early maturity and pest resilience.  
- Monitoring and evaluation: develop indicators (seed availability, varietal diversity, adoption rates, import dependency) to track impact and adapt policies.

7. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
APSA‑Sahel is not only a regional agricultural initiative; it has multiple external implications that dovetail with Indian strategic interests and approaches to security and diplomacy:
- Food security as strategic interest: India’s own experience with seed‑led agricultural transformation (Green Revolution) and ongoing concerns about food security make APSA‑Sahel a relevant case for Indian agricultural diplomacy. India views food and agricultural collaboration as instruments of soft power and stable bilateral relations with African states.  
- South–South cooperation and development diplomacy: APSA‑Sahel presents an opportunity for India to deepen ties with Sahelian states through technical assistance, capacity building and research partnerships—consistent with India’s preference for non‑conditional, demand‑driven cooperation.  
- Scientific and institutional convergence: Indian institutions (e.g., ICRISAT, ICAR research network, state agricultural universities) have technical expertise in dryland cereals, sorghum, pearl millet and pigeonpea—crops central to the Sahel—which can be deployed to support APSA‑Sahel. Leveraging these links can enhance India’s diplomatic footprint.  
- Geopolitical competition and influence: as strategic actors (including China and traditional Western donors) intensify engagement in Africa, India’s active, collaborative support for APSA‑Sahel could reinforce its image as a partner respectful of local ownership and farmer sovereignty.  
- National security linkages: by helping stabilise agricultural livelihoods and food systems in the Sahel, India can contribute indirectly to regional resilience—reducing drivers of instability (food shortages, unemployment) that can give rise to conflict and transnational insecurity. This aligns with a broader conception of security that extends beyond military measures to developmental and cooperative instruments.  
- Intellectual property and normative alignment: India’s domestic statute and international posture on seed regulations and farmers’ rights (including its historical resistance to overly expansive seed patents) positions it to advocate for farmer‑protective frameworks within APSA‑Sahel, safeguarding agrobiodiversity from commercial appropriation.

8. Policy recommendations for Indian engagement with APSA‑Sahel  
To translate opportunity into coherent policy, Indian decision‑makers might consider the following steps:
- Technical partnerships: mobilise Indian agricultural research bodies (ICRISAT, ICAR institutes, state universities) for collaborative breeding projects and training programmes focused on dryland crops.  
- Capacity building and finance: offer targeted funding and technical assistance for seed quality labs, community seed banks and decentralised multiplication units, ideally blended with multilateral finance to ensure sustainability.  
- Legal and policy advice: provide expertise on harmonising seed laws, developing regional certification regimes that protect farmer rights, and crafting benefit‑sharing arrangements for indigenous germplasm.  
- Development diplomacy: integrate support for APSA‑Sahel into India’s Africa engagement platforms (India–Africa Forum Summits, ITEC, concessional lines of credit) to signal long‑term partnership.  
- Monitoring cooperation: co‑develop M&E indicators with APSA‑Sahel so that outputs (varietal diversity, local seed availability, import reduction) are tracked and shared—strengthening transparency and learning.  
- Risk management: coordinate with partners on logistics and security planning to ensure seed distribution is feasible in conflict‑affected zones and to reduce the risk of disruption.  
- Normative leadership: champion farmer rights and agrobiodiversity conservation in multilateral fora, leveraging India’s positions to deter commercial capture of indigenous seed resources.

Conclusion  
APSA‑Sahel exemplifies a strategic, regionally owned approach to agricultural resilience that combines technical, legal and political measures to build food sovereignty in a fragile climate zone. For India, such initiatives are analytically and practically relevant: they intersect with the country’s developmental diplomacy, scientific capacities, normative stances on seeds and intellectual property, and broader conception of national security that includes food systems and regional stability. Thoughtful Indian engagement—grounded in technical partnerships, legal safeguards, finance and monitoring—would advance both Sahelian resilience and India’s strategic interests in Africa, while reinforcing a model of cooperative, non‑hegemonic internationalism consistent with India’s strategic culture.  

Suggested monitoring indicators for APSA‑Sahel (for policymakers and scholars)  
- Seed availability: proportion of households in target zones with access to locally produced seed during sowing windows.  
- Varietal diversity: number of indigenous/locally adapted varieties conserved and in circulation.  
- Adoption rate: percentage of farmers using APSA‑supported varieties or seed services.  
- Import dependency: change in seed import volumes and value for staple dryland crops.  
- Institutional capacity: number of functioning community seed banks, trained seed multipliers and operational regional testing labs.  
- Economic impact: livelihoods created through local seed enterprises and changes in farmer incomes attributable to improved seed access.

### Case Study: The Inaugural Alliance of Sahel States (AES) Games — Event, Dynamics, and Strategic Implications for India

Summary
- Event: inaugural (first annual) AES Games, a one-week multi-sport competition.
- Dates and duration: 21–28 June 2025.
- Host: Mali.
- Participation scale: more than 500 professional athletes from AES member states.
- Sports: soccer, traditional wrestling, archery, and other events combining modern and traditional disciplines.
- Stated purpose: an AES initiative to build solidarity and a shared identity within the confederation.

This section situates the AES Games in the broader political and security context of the Sahel, analyses the event’s symbolic and operational significance, and draws out the implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. It closes with recommended follow‑ups and intelligence requirements for policymakers and analysts in New Delhi.

1. Event description and immediate readings
- The inaugural AES Games were explicitly framed as a recurring, institutionalised AES activity by the “first annual” label. Such language signals an intention to normalise and ritualise inter‑state cooperation within the alliance.
- The designation of participants as “professional athletes” implies formal selection processes and investment in sporting infrastructure and administration. That 500+ athletes attended indicates an event of modest regional scale rather than a broad international tournament.
- Inclusion of traditional wrestling and archery alongside global sports such as soccer indicates a deliberate blending of cultural heritage and modern sport. This hybrid programming seeks both to appeal to popular cultural sensibilities and to construct a distinctive AES identity.

2. Soft power, legitimacy, and identity-building
- Soft‑power projection: Sporting diplomacy is a low‑cost, high‑visibility instrument for nascent political groupings. The AES Games allow member states to showcase cohesion, capacity to organise transnational events, and an outward‑facing narrative of normalcy and cooperation.
- Domestic legitimacy: For states governed by military authorities (a salient feature in parts of the Sahel), public spectacles like sports tournaments can underpin regime legitimacy by fostering pride and diverting attention from governance deficits.
- Identity formation: Multi‑sport and cultural competitions perform identity work — they create rituals, symbols, and shared memories that can be mobilised to forge an emergent AES collective identity among populations fragmented by ethnic, linguistic, and national cleavages.
- Leadership signalling: Mali’s role as host for the inaugural edition conveys symbolic and possibly practical leadership within the AES. Host selection, ceremonial roles, and media prominence are all levers of intra‑alliance status.

3. Operational and administrative implications
- Logistics and capacity: Organising a multi‑national event, even of this scale, necessitates credible venue management, accommodation and transport logistics, medical services, and event administration. Successfully executing the Games demonstrates a minimum administrative capacity that extends beyond narrow security or military functions.
- Security arrangements: In a region afflicted by insurgency, counter‑insurgency and criminal violence, the security apparatus required for safe conduct is substantial. The AES had to plan and resource perimeter security, venue hardening, movement security, and contingency responses — an operational test of cooperative security mechanics.
- Funding and sustainability: The cost structure (national budgets, bloc-level allocations, private sponsors, or foreign donors) affects whether the event can be institutionalised. External sponsorship or funding tied to particular patrons also shapes political alignment and influence.

4. Geopolitical calculus and risk considerations
- Regional signalling and balancing: A public AES endeavour can be read as a political signal to other regional bodies (notably ECOWAS) and external actors (former colonial powers, Russia, China, Turkey, and Gulf states). It demonstrates an alternative axis of cooperation and can be used to contest prevailing regional norms or external interventions.
- Legitimacy tradeoffs: If AES membership is dominated by military regimes, the Games may unintentionally provide international visibility and de facto recognition — a soft legitimacy that complicates diplomatic pressure based on democratic norms.
- Security vulnerabilities: High‑profile events can become targets for extremist groups seeking propaganda value or disruption. They also create potential flashpoints for protests or cross‑border incidents, especially in contested border zones.
- External influence vectors: Funding, technical assistance, or media partnerships tied to external patrons can bring influence. Which states or companies help stage the event is analytically important for understanding evolving spheres of influence in the Sahel.

5. Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s normative posture: India traditionally emphasises multilateralism, respect for sovereignty, and development cooperation. Its strategic culture is cautious about overt alignment with regimes perceived as undemocratic, yet pragmatic when security or strategic interests are present.
- Soft‑power opportunity vs. principled distance: The AES Games illustrate the potency of sports and cultural diplomacy to consolidate ties. For India, this raises a policy tradeoff:
  - Opportunity: India can consider non‑political avenues of engagement (sports exchanges, capacity building in sports medicine or event management, cultural programmes) that advance people‑to‑people ties without formal political endorsement of ruling authorities.
  - Principle: Care is required to avoid optics of legitimising military rule if New Delhi’s diplomatic posture seeks to promote democratic values.
- Security interests: Instability in the Sahel has transregional implications — migration flows, trafficking networks, and potential safe havens for violent non‑state actors can indirectly affect Indian interests (diaspora safety, maritime security through linkages with trans‑Saharan networks, and broader global counter‑terrorism cooperation). India should therefore monitor such developments for risk transmission.
- Competition and partnerships: Major powers (Russia, China, Turkey) and regional stakeholders maintain active outreach in the Sahel. India must calibrate incremental engagement that leverages niche competencies (capacity building in governance, IT, health, education) without overcommitting resources or becoming entangled in great‑power rivalry dynamics.

6. Practical recommendations for Indian policymakers and intelligence analysts
Short‑term monitoring priorities
- Confirm AES membership roster and attendance: who attended in practice (states, delegations, civilian vs. military officials).
- Catalogue full programme and ancillary cultural events: to assess the reach of identity‑building efforts.
- Track official communications and media coverage: evaluate narratives aimed at domestic vs. international audiences and any emphasis on leadership claims.
- Assess security planning and incidents: whether the event passed peacefully or involved security breaches; evaluate coordination among AES member security services.
- Identify funding sources and external partners: sponsors, equipment providers, media partners, and foreign advisors present.

Medium‑term policy options for India
- Offer targeted, apolitical technical assistance: sports medicine training, event management workshops, youth coaching exchanges — instruments that build goodwill without overt political signaling.
- Leverage multilateral channels: coordinate any engagement through UN or African Union frameworks to reduce bilateral political salience and align with global norms.
- Expand situational awareness: deepen intelligence sharing and open‑source monitoring of Sahel developments that could affect Indian nationals, trade routes, or counter‑terrorism cooperation.
- Calibrate public diplomacy: if engaging, frame Indian involvement around development, education and youth empowerment rather than state‑to‑state endorsement.

7. Conclusion: institutional symbolism and strategic ambiguity
The AES Games are more than a sporting event; they are a deliberately choreographed act of statecraft intended to forge cohesion, confer legitimacy, and project normalcy. For India, such spectacles present both opportunities for benign engagement and risks of unintended legitimisation of politically contentious actors. India’s strategic culture—pragmatic, multilateralist, and mindful of normative commitments—suggests a cautious, rules‑based approach: observe closely, offer people‑centric cooperation through credible multilateral channels, and maintain a robust analytic effort to understand how such regional rituals reshape local power configurations and external influence in the Sahel.

Appendix — Recommended intelligence and policy checklist
- Confirm AES full membership and delegation lists for 2025 Games.
- Gather comprehensive event programme, participant profiles, and accompanying cultural activities.
- Record official statements from AES, Mali, and other member governments; archive domestic press coverage and social‑media messaging.
- Assess security plans, force compositions, any incidents, and lessons learned by AES security services.
- Trace funding and external assistance (who financed venues, logistics, broadcasts).
- Monitor declarations regarding the “next” AES Games to judge institutionalisation prospects.

## Case study: The AES confederation’s recent integration measures — implications for strategic culture and national security policy

Brief summary
- Three Sahel states — Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, here referred to in government statements as members of an AES confederation — have recently taken several cooperative steps: abolition of intra-confederation mobile roaming charges; introduction (and scheduled broader rollout) of a joint biometric passport; a scheduled common passport effective 29 January 2025; a planned common external customs duty of 0.5% from end-March 2025; formal adoption of a confederal anthem in May 2025; and inter‑state work on harmonized road‑safety standards. These measures are uneven in quality and acceptance: a recently issued biometric passport is already being refused recognition by neighbouring Senegal, illustrating both practical and diplomatic risks.

This section places those measures in analytical perspective and draws out the practical, security and policy lessons that matter for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Timeline and discrete measures
- Recent (unspecified): announcement/initial issuance of a joint biometric passport for AES citizens — reportedly already facing recognition problems.
- 29 January 2025: common passport for AES member states to come into effect.
- End‑March 2025: introduction of a common customs duty of 0.5% on imports from non‑members.
- May 2025: validation of a confederation anthem by the Ministers of Culture.
- May 2025: meeting of road‑authority experts from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger to define a common approach to road safety.
- Ongoing/near‑term: abolition of roaming charges for telephone communications within the three‑state area.

2. What each measure seeks to achieve (functional and symbolic)
- Abolition of roaming charges
  - Functional: immediately lowers transactional costs for citizens and businesses, facilitating market exchange, social ties and logistical coordination across borders.
  - Political/symbolic: visible, everyday benefit that can build popular legitimacy for the confederation project.
- Joint biometric and common passport
  - Functional: intended to facilitate freedom of movement, streamline border procedures and create a shared identity instrument across member states.
  - Symbolic: a strong marker of political integration and shared sovereignty.
- Common external customs duty (0.5%)
  - Functional: an attempt to harmonize trade policy, simplify tariffs on transit and imports, and ensure some measure of revenue parity.
  - Symbolic/strategic: a step toward customs union architecture, even if the rate is low.
- Confederation anthem
  - Symbolic: identity consolidation; instruments of nation‑building applied at the confederal level.
  - Diplomatic: expresses political intent to be seen as a coherent actor in regional and international fora.
- Road‑safety cooperation
  - Functional: practical harmonization of vehicle and driver standards, data sharing and enforcement that supports safer movement of people and goods along key corridors.

3. Practical obstacles and the problem of recognition
- The refusal of Senegal to accept the new biometric passport demonstrates how technical rollout can be nullified by diplomatic/recognition disputes. For a passport to be useful it must be:
  - Politically accepted by neighbouring states and by international carriers and border authorities;
  - Technically credible (secure issuance, anti‑fraud features, interoperable verification back‑ends);
  - Accompanied by bilateral and multilateral mutual‑recognition agreements and coordination with airlines and migration authorities.
- Recognition disputes have immediate operational effects (denial of entry, disrupted trade and transit routes) and longer‑term credibility costs for the issuing confederation.
- The presence of inconsistent organizational terminology (AES, Confederation, CES) in public communications also undermines the clarity needed for diplomatic acceptance.

4. Customs harmonization: substance versus symbolism
- A 0.5% common external duty is low by international standards. Its likely purposes:
  - Administrative harmonization and a symbolic first step toward a common external tariff.
  - Revenue‑sharing signals more than actual protection of domestic producers.
- Practical success requires:
  - Strong customs administration, anti‑smuggling capacity and coordinated enforcement;
  - Clear rules on revenue allocation and transit procedures;
  - Alignment with wider regional trade frameworks (otherwise trade diversion and tariff shopping can occur).

5. Security, governance and technical prerequisites
- Secure biometric passport schemes require:
  - Trusted civil‑registry data sources and secure issuance procedures; biometric capture and secure chip technology; cryptographic standards that meet international airline and immigration requirements;
  - Interoperable border‑management systems and training for migration officers;
  - Independent audit, anti‑fraud mechanisms and transparent procurement.
- Road‑safety harmonization demands:
  - Agreed technical standards (vehicle safety, driver licensing), interoperable enforcement protocols and shared accident data to inform policy.
- Across all measures, uneven governance capacity, porous borders and security challenges in the Sahel create both opportunity (useful integration) and risk (exploitation by non‑state armed actors, corruption and smuggling).

6. Risks and likely failure modes
- Diplomatic non‑recognition (Senegal’s refusal): immediate disruption of travel and trade; reputational damage.
- Technical shortfalls: insecure issuance or weak interoperability can lead to international airlines and states treating the passport as unacceptable.
- Administrative mismatch: low tariff rate combined with weak border control can encourage illicit trade rather than orderly commerce and revenue collection.
- Political fragmentation: inconsistent messaging (different acronyms and governance frames) saps external confidence and invites rival regional actors to exploit divisions.
- Security exploitation: new identity documents or simplified transit rules, if insecure, can be used by organized criminal networks or militants.

7. Recommendations for AES stakeholders (derived from international practice)
- Prioritize diplomatic engagement with neighbouring states (including Senegal) and regional/regulatory bodies to secure mutual recognition agreements before wide rollout.
- Invest in secure issuance infrastructure, back‑end verification systems and independent audits of passport production.
- Pair the symbolic measures (anthem, passport covers) with hard technical assistance: capacity building for customs, border control, and anti‑smuggling operations.
- Clarify institutional branding and public communications to present a coherent governance architecture.
- Sequence reforms to ensure immediate public benefits (e.g., roaming abolition) are matched by technical credibility (passport recognition, customs enforcement).
- Convert road‑safety working groups into deliverable projects with measurable targets: standardized driving licences, cross‑border enforcement pilots, shared accident databases.

8. Lessons and implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
This Sahel case offers several lessons particularly relevant for Indian policymakers and strategists. India’s strategic culture — grounded in sovereignty, pragmatic incrementalism, preference for technical assistance and partnership, and a rising interest in external economic and security engagement — can apply and adapt these lessons in its external policies.

- Symbolic measures need technical substance
  - India’s diplomacy often attaches weight to symbolic statecraft (high‑level visits, development projects, infrastructure gifting). The AES case shows that symbols—passports, anthems—must be accompanied by technical credibility. When India supports institutional projects abroad (e.g., digital ID systems, e‑governance), it should ensure procurement transparency, secure technical architecture and recipient capacity to operate the systems.
- Sequence and coherence matter
  - Incremental, visible wins (like abolition of roaming) can build public legitimacy for larger integration projects. India’s neighborhood policy can emulate this sequencing: quick, tangible benefits (connectivity, mobile/telecom reforms, scholarships) to build trust before deeper security or institutional commitments are sought.
- Recognition is political as much as technical
  - A passport’s utility depends on political recognition. India’s engagements in multilateral bodies and with regional powers should aim to secure diplomatic buy‑in for technical projects it sponsors (e.g., biometric systems for partner states). India should use its convening power in regional forums, and coordinate with global bodies (UN, African Union) to support mutual recognition.
- Investment in capacity building pays strategic dividends
  - Harmonized customs and safe border management require long‑term institution‑building. India’s technical assistance (training for customs, police, IT systems) is likely to be more effective than one‑off donations. Such capacity investments also build trust and create interoperability that can be mobilized in crisis.
- Communications and branding are strategic tools
  - Confusion over organizational terms in AES undermined credibility. India should ensure that projects it sponsors or embeds itself in carry clear legal and public messaging, to reduce ambiguity that adversaries can exploit.
- Security externalities should be front and centre
  - In fragile contexts, integration that eases movement can also ease the mobility of non‑state armed actors, contraband and terrorists. India’s strategic culture—balancing development and security—suggests dual tracks: facilitate legitimate economic activity while fielding targeted capacity for anti‑smuggling, migration screening and intelligence sharing.
- Use of regional institutions and multilateral endorsement
  - Just as AES might seek regional endorsement for its passport and tariffs, India should encourage and support regional and multilateral validation of technical projects it backs. Endorsement by institutions like the African Union, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) or UN agencies confers legitimacy and practical acceptance.

9. Conclusion: calibrating ambition and capability
The AES confederation’s measures are emblematic of the interplay between symbolism and technicality in regional integration. They illustrate how low‑cost, high‑visibility steps (roaming abolition, anthems) can rapidly build public support, while more technical measures (biometric passports, customs harmonization) founder unless matched by diplomatic recognition, institutional capacity and rigorous standards.

For Indian strategic culture and national security policy, the lesson is methodological rather than prescriptive: pursue incremental, visibly beneficial cooperation; ensure that symbolic commitments are matched by technical and institutional substance; anchor initiatives in widely accepted standards and multilateral recognition; and incorporate security safeguards from the outset. When India sponsors or partners in foreign institutional reforms, it strengthens both the immediate impact and its long‑term strategic footprint by combining diplomacy, technical assistance and capacity building in a coherent package.

### Member states — Alliance of Sahel States (AES)

This section presents a concise, analytically framed profile of the three members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) — Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger — and draws out implications that are relevant to strategic practitioners and policy-makers, including those engaged in formulation of India’s national security and external engagement strategy. The aim is to move from basic demographic and macroeconomic indicators to a discussion of strategic significance: territorial control, economic capacity, social-linguistic composition, governance and security challenges, and the consequences of intra‑bloc imbalances for both the AES itself and external actors seeking to engage with the Sahel.

Table 1: AES member states — basic demographic, territorial and macroeconomic snapshot

| Country | Capital | Major local / lingua-franca language(s) | Population (thousands) | Area (km2) | Nominal GDP (millions USD) | GDP (PPP) (millions Intl$) |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|

  - GDP (PPP) per capita (bloc, approx): US$2,636.8
  - Population density (bloc, approx): 28.18 persons/km2

Analytical observations and strategic relevance

1. Low-income profile and per‑capita context
   - All three AES members exhibit low nominal GDP per capita (roughly US$750–1,110) and modest PPP‑adjusted incomes (roughly US$2,100–3,000). This situates the bloc firmly in the low‑income country category and signals limited fiscal space for large-scale defence or development spending without external assistance.
   - For external actors (including India), this has two implications: (a) the AES states are likely to welcome concessional financing, capacity-building and development assistance; (b) their bargaining leverage on high‑value strategic projects (e.g., infrastructure-for-security arrangements, large defence procurements) is constrained by budgetary limits and donor dependence.

2. Territorial scale and population density
   - The AES controls a contiguous Sahel territory of approximately 2.78 million km2 but with a relatively small combined population (~78.4 million). This produces a low overall population density (~28 persons/km2) with marked internal variance: Burkina Faso is comparatively densely populated, whereas Mali and Niger have large sparsely settled areas.
   - Strategically, low density and vast territory complicate governance, border control and counter‑insurgency operations — an observation central to understanding why the AES emphasizes mutual security cooperation. For foreign partners, logistics, basing and mobility are costlier; intelligence and footprint requirements are higher.

3. Economic structure and vulnerability
   - The combination of low per‑capita GDP, large rural populations and expansive arid/semi‑arid zones points to economies dependent on subsistence and smallholder agriculture, pastoralism, extractive commodities (uranium in Niger; gold in Mali and Burkina), and substantial informal sectors.
   - Such profiles indicate heightened sensitivity to climatic shocks, commodity price swings and disruptions in global demand. They also create conditions in which armed non‑state actors can exploit grievances and porous borders.

4. Language, governance and social cohesion
   - The table lists dominant local lingua‑franca languages (Mooré, Dyula, Bambara, Hausa); however, in administrative, legal and intergovernmental contexts French retains formal status across all three states. Recognizing both formal and vernacular linguistic realities is essential when designing public diplomacy, information campaigns or training programs.
   - Linguistic and ethnic heterogeneity intersects with governance deficits and uneven state presence, contributing to localized grievances that can have cross‑border security consequences.

5. Security and political context
   - All three states have, in recent years, faced insurgencies (various jihadi groups), internal displacement, and political instability including coups. The AES has been, to a significant degree, a response to such threats — providing a mechanism for collective military coordination and political alignment among governments seeking mutual support.
   - For external actors, the AES’s security orientation means that partnerships are likely to be framed primarily in military‑security and stabilization terms rather than large-scale trade or investment cooperation alone.

6. Bloc-level bargaining power and limitations
   - Aggregated GDP (~US$72 billion nominal) and population size endow the AES with limited economic weight at the global level; however, the bloc’s control of a large strategic Sahel territory and shared security concerns create leverage in regional diplomacy and in negotiations with external security partners.
   - For India, this suggests opportunities to engage on niche, high‑value areas (training, UN peacekeeping support, humanitarian assistance, capacity‑building in governance and institutions) instead of competing on large capital‑intensive infrastructure projects without concessional financing.

7. Internal imbalances and their operational implications
   - Disparities — Niger’s larger population but lower per‑capita output, Mali’s huge territorial extent but low density, Burkina Faso’s higher density — will influence allocation of AES resources, burden‑sharing for defence deployments, and the internal politics of the alliance.
   - These imbalances can affect NATO‑style interoperability ambitions, logistics planning, and the politics of external assistance distribution.

Data quality, limitations and caveats
- Temporal ambiguity: The figures provided lack an explicit year. Cross‑year comparisons and trend analysis require dating each data point (e.g., IMF/World Bank year).
- Terminology: The table labels “Official language” but omits the uniformly used administrative language (French). Precision in labeling is important for policy design.
- Aggregation risks: Per‑capita and density averages obscure substantial subnational variation; for operational planning, provincial/département-level data are often more relevant.
- Missing indicators: No sectoral breakdown (agriculture/manufacturing/services), fiscal metrics (budgets, debt), military expenditure, human development, refugee/IDP counts, or governance indices are included — these are necessary for deeper strategic assessment.
- Source verification: The dataset’s provenance is unstated. Validation against primary sources (IMF WEO, World Bank WDI, UN population division) is recommended before formal use.

Recommended next steps for analysis (research and policy)
1. Source validation and temporal sequencing
   - Verify and date all figures against IMF, World Bank and UN databases; construct a time series (5–10 years) for GDP, population and density metrics to identify trajectories and shocks.

2. Enrich economic and fiscal data
   - Add sectoral composition (agriculture, industry, services), fiscal balances, external debt, reserves and remittance flows. For security‑focused engagement, include defence budgets and security expenditure trends.

3. Security and human mobility metrics
   - Integrate indicators on internal displacement, refugee flows, known militant group activity, and cross‑border illicit trade routes. Map hotspots and lines of communication relevant to AES cooperation.

4. Subnational mapping
   - Map population, ethnic/linguistic distributions, state presence and infrastructure at subnational levels to inform where external assistance and capacity‑building will have highest impact.

5. Scenario and contingency analysis
   - Build scenarios linking economic shocks, climate stressors and political instability to assess AES resilience and the potential need for external crisis response.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s strategic culture emphasizes non‑alignment, capacity-building, development cooperation and defence diplomacy as tools of influence. In engaging the AES, India’s policy options should reflect these traditions while adapting to the AES’s security‑first orientation.
  - Defence and security cooperation: India can expand training (military medicine, counter‑IED, logistics), intelligence‑sharing on terrorism financing and capacity‑building for UN peacekeeping contingents drawn from the Sahel.
  - Development diplomacy: Offer concessional lines of credit, agricultural resilience programs (drought‑resilient seeds, irrigation), and skills training that target root causes of instability.
  - Energy and mining linkages: Niger’s uranium and regional mineral resources present possibilities for partnership in energy and resource governance, subject to rigorous governance safeguards and financing models.
  - Soft power and institution-building: Scholarships, technical assistance for civil administration, police reform and local governance can strengthen state legitimacy — an important preventive measure against insurgency recruitment.
  - Multilateralism: India should use multilateral forums (AU, UN, G20 outreach mechanisms) to coordinate assistance, avoiding zero‑sum competition and ensuring alignment with regional priorities.
- Constraints for India: Low fiscal capacity of AES members limits direct commercial opportunities; security volatility raises risk for long‑term investments; engagement will be incremental and likely concentrated in capacity‑building, humanitarian assistance and selective development projects.

Concluding synthesis
The AES is a compact but strategically significant bloc: small in aggregate GDP and constrained by developmental deficits, yet occupying a large and geopolitically sensitive Sahel territory. For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the AES presents both challenges and targeted opportunities. India’s historically calibrated approach — combining development cooperation, capacity‑building and defence diplomacy — is well suited to the AES context, but must be guided by robust data, careful risk assessment and coordination with other external actors. Priorities for both scholarly inquiry and policy design include closing data gaps, mapping subnational vulnerabilities, and designing programs that couple security assistance with developmental measures to address the underlying drivers of instability.

Suggested immediate actions for policy practitioners
- Commission an updated dataset (IMF/World Bank/UN‑sourced) with year‑tagged indicators and subnational layers.
- Prioritise pilot programmes in training and humanitarian assistance that can be scaled, conditioned on clear governance safeguards.
- Engage multilaterally to ensure India’s aid and security cooperation are complementarity‑oriented and avoid unintended political consequences within the Sahel.

(For formal publication or operational planning, all figures should be cross‑checked against the latest IMF World Economic Outlook, World Bank World Development Indicators and UN population estimates; the present analysis is structured to inform that verification and subsequent policy design.)

## Resources and Strategic Stakes in the Sahel: The Alliance of Sahel States (AES)

This section examines the resource endowments of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), recent patterns of contestation over those resources, and the security and geopolitical dynamics that shape access to them. Although this material was flagged in source drafts as needing refinement, it is central to understanding why the Sahel has become a theatre of competing external interests and why resource politics there has important lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

### 1. Overview: endowments, exports and strategic importance
The AES member states are materially endowed in minerals and hydrocarbons. Extractive commodities figure prominently in their export baskets and in the fiscal calculus of their governments. Two features deserve emphasis for strategic analysis:

- Strategic materials: Uranium and lithium, in particular, have outsized geopolitical value. Uranium is directly relevant to civilian nuclear fuel cycles (and indirectly to military considerations), while lithium feeds the global battery supply chain critical for electrification and defence-adjacent technologies.
- Diversified extractives: Aside from strategic minerals, AES states export gold, phosphates, iron ore, and hydrocarbons; some (e.g., Mali) also possess hydropower potential and important agricultural commodities such as cotton (Burkina Faso, Mali).

Table — principal mineral and energy resources (concise)
- Niger: uranium, coal, iron ore, tin, phosphates, gold, molybdenum, gypsum, salt, petroleum, copper, lithium  
- Burkina Faso: gold, manganese, zinc, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt, lithium, copper; cotton  
- Mali: gold, phosphates, kaolin, salt, limestone, uranium, gypsum, granite, hydropower, lithium; cotton

These endowments explain why AES states attract sustained external interest from established Western firms and a growing set of Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises.

### 2. Case study: Niger’s uranium and the Niger–Benin pipeline
Niger’s uranium production is central to the region’s external strategic salience:

- According to Euratom data, Niger delivered 2,975 tonnes of natural uranium to the EU in 2022—about 25.4% of EU supplies—making it the bloc’s second-largest supplier that year.  
- In 2023, Niger’s uranium shipments to the EU fell by roughly 29.8%, causing Niger to drop to the fourth-largest EU supplier.  
- On a global scale Niger accounts for just under 5% of mined uranium production.

Niger also pursued crude oil exports via the Chinese-funded Niger–Benin pipeline. Reports indicate China intervened in May 2024 to enable a resumption of exports, but the line closed again after a terror attack damaged infrastructure. Such episodes encapsulate two interlinked patterns: (a) growing Chinese operational involvement in Sahel energy corridors and (b) the fragility of export infrastructure under security stress.

### 3. Political economy trendlines: nationalization, renegotiation and resource nationalism
Since the early 2020s there has been a marked political-economic shift in AES states’ posture toward foreign firms and contracts:

- Renegotiation and revocation: Several AES governments initiated renegotiations of contracts with Western and Chinese companies to assert higher state shares and stricter sovereignty terms. Examples cited in the AES context include revocations of mining licences (e.g., Canadian firm GoviEX in Niger) and the reopening of discussions with major miners such as Barrick Gold in Mali.
- Nationalization: In 2025, select mining assets were reported to have been nationalized to boost government ownership and fiscal take.
- Targeting of foreign firms: French firms (Orano, TotalEnergies, Air France) and Chinese enterprises (CNNC, Zijing) faced operational and political pressures; Niger reportedly requested the departure of senior local officials from CNPC and other Chinese-linked entities in March 2025.

These moves reflect a broader, global resurgence of resource nationalism: governments seeking higher rents, greater local control, political signalling of sovereignty, and domestic redistribution of extractive gains.

### 4. Security as an operational constraint
Insurgency, terrorist attacks and generalized insecurity in the Sahel materially raise the cost and risk of extraction and transport:

- Physical risk: Pipelines and mine sites are vulnerable to sabotage; attacks can halt exports immediately and damage long-term investor confidence.
- Fiscal and logistical risk: Higher security, insurance and operating costs reduce profitability and complicate project financing.
- Governance risk: Weak state capacity to guarantee security and uphold contractual commitments heightens the likelihood of abrupt policy shifts (e.g., license revocation) and international arbitration.

Taken together, resource wealth in the Sahel is not just an economic issue: it is inseparable from questions of state capacity, political legitimacy and external alignment.

### 5. Geopolitical competition: West, China and a shifting balance
AES resource politics occur within a contest of influence between Western actors (especially former colonial powers and EU firms) and China:

- Western exposure: Historically, French and European companies were dominant in uranium and oil sectors; recent operational disruptions and political pushback signal a decline in untroubled access.
- Chinese presence: Beijing’s financing of infrastructure (e.g., pipelines), large-scale investment and willingness to accept political risk have increased Chinese leverage. Yet Chinese firms are themselves vulnerable to local sovereignty assertions and contract renegotiation.
- Outcomes: Competition can increase AES bargaining power but also risk aligning governments more closely with one external patron, creating new dependencies and strategic trade-offs.

For global buyers, the trend leads to diversification of suppliers and a reconsideration of strategic stockpiles and long-term contracting practices.

### 6. Implications and consequences (summary)
The resource dynamics of the AES produce multiple consequences with bearing beyond the region:

- For importing states (EU, other buyers): disruptions in Nigerese uranium or Sahelian oil can prompt supplier diversification, short-term price effects and strategic stockpiling; the magnitude of global market disruption is likely limited but locally acute.
- For investors: nationalizations, revocations and security threats raise political risk premia, increase the cost of capital and may constrict new investment.
- For AES governments: asserting control can yield immediate fiscal benefits and domestic legitimacy gains, but may deter future foreign investment and invite legal claims.
- For regional stability: resource disputes and attacks on infrastructure compound governance challenges, potentially deepening cycles of instability.
- For great-power competition: access to strategic minerals (uranium, lithium) feeds broader geopolitical competition and supply-chain realignments.

### 7. Risks arising from the current trajectory
Key risks to anticipate:
- Investment flight and capital scarcity if AES regulatory environments are seen as unpredictable.
- Protracted investor–state arbitration and reputational costs for both host states and companies.
- Escalating security costs and interrupted exports due to insurgent activity.
- Over-reliance on a single external partner (either Western firms or China) that can skew political autonomy.

### 8. Policy implications and recommendations for India
Although India’s direct commercial exposure to the AES is limited compared to China or EU states, the Sahel’s resource politics have several policy resonances for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. The following recommendations are tailored to Indian interests—securing resources, protecting investments, preserving strategic autonomy, and being a responsible external actor—while operating within India’s traditional preferences for non-intervention and diversified partnerships.

1. Strategic mapping and risk assessment
   - Maintain a forward-looking strategic map of Sahel resource producers (uranium, lithium, gold, hydrocarbons) and the firms—state and private—active there.
   - Conduct scenario-based risk assessments that combine political, security and commercial variables; integrate these into decision-making for fuel procurement, supply-chain planning and diplomatic engagement.

2. Diversify suppliers and build redundancy
   - For critical minerals (uranium, lithium), India should diversify procurement sources and invest in strategic stockpiling where feasible (consistent with domestic legal and diplomatic constraints).
   - Encourage Indian firms to pursue joint ventures and equity stakes with risk-sharing designs (e.g., production-sharing, state-participation models) rather than pure service contracts in high-risk jurisdictions.

3. Diplomatic engagement and multilateralism
   - Deepen diplomatic engagement with AES states through tailored development assistance, capacity-building in resource governance, and technical cooperation—avoiding zero-sum positioning vis-à-vis other external actors.
   - Leverage multilateral fora (AU, UN, World Bank, regional development banks) to support transparency initiatives and conflict-prevention programs tied to extractive industries.

4. Investment protection and contract design
   - Insist on clear, legally robust contracts with well-defined renegotiation mechanisms, stabilization clauses, local-content requirements and mutually agreed arbitration procedures.
   - Promote transparent fiscal terms and publish contracts or summaries in line with Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)-style norms to reduce political surprise and reputational risk.

5. Security cooperation calibrated to Indian norms
   - Offer non-combat security assistance focused on infrastructure protection, training of civilian security forces, surveillance and incident response capacity, avoiding direct combat involvement.
   - Support regional security initiatives and intelligence-sharing on threats to resource corridors; prioritize multilateral and African-led frameworks to respect host sovereignty.

6. Risk-mitigation instruments
   - Expand use of export-credit agencies, political-risk insurance and guarantees to de-risk private investment in the Sahel.
   - Encourage Indian private sector to structure investments with phased capital deployment tied to security and governance benchmarks.

7. Local economic integration and social licence
   - Partner on local-content programs, vocational training, and community benefit-sharing to build political legitimacy for projects and reduce the grievance-fuel that insurgents exploit.
   - Support environmental and social impact assessments and feasible mitigation measures to lower project disruption risk.

8. Leverage soft power and developmental diplomacy
   - Use education, health and infrastructure cooperation to build durable bilateral relationships that outlast commodity cycles and create political goodwill for Indian commercial activity.

### 9. Lessons for Indian strategic culture
The AES case illustrates several deeper lessons for the evolution of India’s strategic posture:

- Pragmatism within principle: India’s traditional emphasis on sovereignty and non-interference must be combined with pragmatic tools—risk-sharing, multilateral engagement and commercial sophistication—to secure resources in contested environments.
- Resilience over maximalism: Rather than attempting rapid unilateral gains, India should seek resilient, diversified channels for critical materials and protect its investments through careful contract design and insurance.
- Institutional depth: Building institutional capacity (both within government and in state-owned enterprises) to assess political risk, negotiate complex contracts and manage security arrangements is essential.
- Norm entrepreneurship: India can position itself as a partner that supports transparent, equitable resource governance—advantages that can open doors in states wary of heavy-handed external patrons.

### Conclusion
Resources in the AES are a strategic fulcrum: they attract contestation, shape local politics, raise security challenges and influence external alignments. For India, the Sahel’s evolving resource politics are not merely a distant commercial concern but a strategic test of how to combine normative commitments with pragmatic policy instruments. India’s response should emphasize diversification, risk-management, multilateral cooperation and capacity-building—tools that coherently extend India’s strategic culture into the management of distant but geopolitically consequential resource frontiers.

### Case study: Chad’s rapprochement with the Alliance of Sahel States — implications for strategic realignment and lessons for Indian strategic culture

Summary
- In 2025 Chad moved to deepen ties with members of the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) while terminating a longstanding defence cooperation agreement with France. A senior government spokesperson publicly affirmed positive interest in joining the AES. This combination of practical reorientation and public signaling exemplifies a broader pattern observed in several Sahel states: reassertion of sovereignty, regional security cooperation as preferred instrument, and strategic diversification away from former-colonial security patrons.
- The episode has immediate regional-security consequences and wider geopolitical implications. For analysts of strategic culture it also offers a compact illustration of how states use international organisations and security pacts to express identity, secure capabilities, and manage external patrons — themes directly relevant to studies of India’s strategic behaviour.

Context and background
- The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) is a regional security grouping formed to enhance military cooperation, intelligence-sharing and coordinated counterinsurgency efforts across the Sahel. Its members confront a common threat environment: jihadist insurgencies, transnational crime, porous borders and fragile political institutions. Collective arrangements like the AES aim to pool scarce capacities, provide political cover for robust operations, and signal unity.
- Chad historically hosted and worked closely with French forces on counterterrorism and border security. That cooperation provided material capabilities (training, logistics, intelligence linkage) and a political anchor. Ending the defence cooperation agreement therefore represents both an operational rupture and a public repositioning.
- Several Sahel governments in recent years have curtailed military or political dependence on France amid domestic political change, public contestation over former-colonial influence, and attraction to alternative security providers. Chad’s choices must be read against this evolving regional pattern.

Decision and public signaling
- Two linked actions define Chad’s pivot: (1) the termination of the formal defence pact with France, and (2) active diplomatic rapprochement with AES members culminating in a senior official’s public endorsement (May 2025) that “I think it would be a good thing for Chad to join the Alliance of Sahel States.”
- The termination of the French agreement is both instrumental (reordering command relationships, logistics, access) and symbolic — a visible assertion of national sovereignty. The public endorsement of AES membership prepares domestic and international audiences for deeper regional integration and reduces the political cost of sudden change.

Drivers and motivations
Analytically, Chad’s choices can be understood through several interacting motives:

- Security-driven motivations
  - A primary driver is operational: collective, regionally-rooted counterterrorism and cross-border security cooperation can be more directly responsive to local conditions than externally led interventions. AES membership promises nearer-term operational coordination, shared intelligence, and the ability to mount cross-border operations with regional consent.
- Political and legitimacy calculations
  - Public distancing from a former colonial power is a potent source of domestic political legitimacy. Political leaderships can use sovereignty narratives to consolidate internal support and to deflect criticism of security policy failures.
- Strategic diversification
  - Redefining partnerships widens strategic options and reduces dependence on a single external patron. This can include cultivating relationships with non-Western states or private military actors who may offer capabilities on different terms.
- Peer effects and regional cohesion
  - When neighbours adopt a new posture, peer pressure and the desire for coordinated policy increase the appeal of joining their institutional frameworks. AES consolidation creates incentives for states to align to prevent isolation and to benefit from collective deterrence.

Operational and political risks
- Diplomatic costs
  - Rapid distancing from a long-term security partner can provoke diplomatic friction and reduce access to aid, training, and intelligence cooperation from that partner and its allies.
- Operational continuity and capability gaps
  - Transitioning command-and-control systems, supply chains, and technical interoperability risks short-term degradation of operational effectiveness. AES-provided capacity may not immediately substitute for specialist capabilities previously supplied by external partners.
- Regional security trade-offs
  - A more cohesive, regionally controlled security architecture can change the conflict dynamic: it may increase pressure on insurgent actors but also concentrate force in ways that produce local grievances if operations are perceived as heavy-handed.
- Geopolitical competition
  - As Western influence recedes, non-Western actors (state or non-state) may expand presence and influence, which could reconfigure regional alignments in ways that complicate longer-term strategic autonomy.

Significance of the public statement
- The government spokesperson’s positive framing about AES membership is not mere rhetoric. In foreign-policy practice such public statements serve multiple purposes: they socially and politically normalize a policy change, create expectations among target audiences (domestic constituencies, regional partners), and reduce the element of surprise for external actors. The statement indicates at least rhetorical high-level support and possibly an intention to pursue formal accession steps.

Interpretation of intent: practical and symbolic
- Chad’s strategy is mixed: it seeks operational advantages from regional cooperation while simultaneously pursuing a sovereignty narrative that strengthens domestic legitimacy. Both logics are common in strategic cultures that prize autonomy and face immediate security threats. The move is consistent with a posture that combines risk-taking in foreign policy with an emphasis on self-determination.

Broader relevance: lessons for India’s strategic culture and policy
While India’s strategic environment differs in scale and geography, the Chad–AES episode yields several transferable insights for Indian scholars and policymakers:

- Institutional choice as identity and capability instrument
  - States use regional security organisations not only to acquire capabilities but also to express political identity. India’s engagement with multilateral platforms (e.g., SCO, Quad, BIMSTEC) similarly blends capability aggregation with normative signaling about autonomy, strategic intent, and regional leadership.
- Managing patronage and autonomy
  - The balancing act between long-term partners and new alignments is universal: dependence buys capabilities but constrains policy independence. India’s strategic culture values non-alignment and strategic autonomy; the Sahel case reinforces the importance of hedging and graduated transitions when changing partnerships to avoid capability gaps.
- Public diplomacy and the sequencing of change
  - Transparent public signaling can cushion transitions by setting expectations. For India, communicating the rationale for reconfiguring security ties (e.g., procurement, exercises, basing arrangements) can reduce misperception among partners and domestic audiences.
- Operational interoperability and transition management
  - Any move away from legacy partners requires meticulous planning for logistics, training, and interoperability. India’s defense planners should note the operational risks of abrupt transitions and the need for phased capacity-building when diversifying suppliers or integrating new multilateral frameworks.
- Geopolitical openings and competitive dynamics
  - Withdrawal of one external actor creates openings for others. India must calibrate how its own presence — diplomatic, developmental, security — can be responsive to partner states’ desire for diversified options without inadvertently accelerating competition that undermines stability.

Recommended monitoring and next steps (for analysts and policy-makers)
- Track formal steps toward AES accession
  - Monitor legal instruments (parliamentary approvals, memoranda of understanding), dates for accession talks, and text of any agreements that define command relationships and obligations.
- Watch operational integration
  - Observe joint exercises, shared bases or logistics agreements, and the presence of AES-coordinated operations. These indicate whether cooperation is rhetorical or operational.
- Follow defense procurement and training shifts
  - New contracts, advisory teams, or equipment deliveries from alternative suppliers reveal substantive capability reorientation.
- Assess external reactions
  - Examine responses from France, the EU, the United States, and potential new partners (e.g., Russia, Turkey, private military companies) to anticipate shifts in aid, intelligence cooperation, and diplomatic posture.
- Monitor security outcomes
  - Use indicators such as cross-border attack frequency, casualty figures, and displacement to judge whether regional cooperation is improving the security environment or creating new tensions.
- Consider domestic political signals
  - Track how the government frames the decision in domestic media and political discourse; sustained domestic support is important for the durability of the policy.

Concluding reflections
- Chad’s pivot toward the AES and away from a historical security patron illustrates a recurrent theme in international security politics: states blend material calculation with symbolic assertions of autonomy when reorganising their external security relations. For students of strategic culture — including India’s — the episode reinforces the need to read institutional affiliations as both capability instruments and identity statements.
- For policymakers, the principal lesson is about sequencing: reconfiguring security ties requires (a) careful management of transitional capability gaps, (b) clear public and diplomatic communication, and (c) anticipatory engagement with potential new partners and rivals. These procedural disciplines preserve strategic autonomy while limiting the short-term costs of realignment.
- Finally, comparative study of cases like Chad reveals that regional organisations can serve as attractive alternatives to distant patrons when they offer credible operational benefits and political legitimacy. India’s own deliberations about how to structure partnerships, lead regional institutions, and maintain autonomy can be enriched by systematic attention to such international experiences.

### 7.x Guinea, the Alliance of Sahel States, and the Geopolitics of Port Access:
Implications for Regional Order and Indian Strategic Calculus

This section examines the recent alignment between Guinea and the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), the tactical use of Guinean maritime ports to sustain landlocked Sahelian partners, and the personal and institutional paradoxes embodied in Guinea’s leader, Colonel Mamady Doumbouya. It situates these developments within broader contestation over regional governance (notably between the AES and ECOWAS), emergent supply-chain geopolitics (including Russian involvement), and the security‑humanitarian implications that follow. The final subsection draws out why these dynamics matter for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

1. The political context: military rule, the AES, and ECOWAS
- Like several other West African states in recent years, Guinea’s current executive power was established through a military takeover. Military governments in the region have gravitated toward each other, formalizing cooperation in instruments such as the Alliance of Sahel States. The AES represents both a security and a political alignment among junta-led capitals that perceive common existential pressures: sanctions, diplomatic isolation, and interventions by regional organizations such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
- ECOWAS has a well‑established normative and operational framework for upholding constitutional order in West Africa, including protocols that allow for border restrictions and collective punitive measures against unconstitutional changes of government. When member states (or candidate members) negotiate or signal contravention of those measures, the effect is to produce a parallel architecture of regional legitimacy — one that substitutes alternative solidarities for ECOWAS’s rules-based order.

2. Port access as strategic lifeline for land‑locked Sahel states
- Many Sahelian states are landlocked and therefore dependent on coastal neighbours for bulk imports — foodstuffs, fertilizer, fuel, and related logistical supplies. Granting access to a maritime port is therefore not a mundane administrative act but a strategic enabling move: it preserves the supply lines that sustain agriculture, livelihoods, and regime survival in Sahel capitals.
- Guinea’s decision to provide port access and to keep logistics corridors open despite ECOWAS border restrictions transformed it into a logistical lifeline for Mali and other AES partners. By doing so, Conakry effectively undercut ECOWAS’s attempt to isolate coup authorities and reinforced the AES’s capacity to function in spite of regional sanctions.

3. The facilitation of Russian shipments and the reconfiguration of partners
- The movement of Russian grain and fertilizer through Guinean ports to Mali — facilitated by the AES–Guinea alignment — is emblematic of a larger geopolitical reorientation. Where Western or multilateral channels become constrained (because of sanctions, political pressure, or broken trust), states in the Sahel and their backers turn to alternative providers. This pattern has two interrelated consequences:
  - It accelerates the penetration of new state and non‑state actors (including Russian governmental and quasi‑governmental entities) into Sahelian economics and security affairs.
  - It signals the diversification of supply chains away from traditional Western-dominated networks, with consequences for influence, patronage, and long-term dependency.
- For humanitarian outcomes, the importation of fertilizer and grain is immediately beneficial — it can stave off crop failures and food scarcity. But it also creates vectors of political leverage: control over inputs translates into bargaining power over domestic populations and inter‑governmental alignments.

4. Defiance of ECOWAS: political signaling and institutional erosion
- Guinea’s breach of ECOWAS measures is not merely transactional; it is highly symbolic. It signals a willingness among junta-led governments to bypass regional governance mechanisms when those mechanisms threaten regime durability. Such behaviour strains ECOWAS’s authority, risks a tit‑for‑tat escalation (sanctions, counter‑blockades, or even coercive measures), and generates prolonged uncertainty that impairs trade, humanitarian relief, and security cooperation across the region.
- The erosion of ECOWAS’s capacity to enforce collective norms produces a space in which alternative regional arrangements (like AES) can normalize juntas’ stay in power, altering the normative landscape of West African interstate relations.

5. Doumbouya’s biography: paradoxes of allegiance and symbolism
- Colonel Mamady Doumbouya is a particularly illustrative case of the contradictions inherent in post‑colonial military elites. Public accounts indicate that he served in French military structures during his earlier career and took an oath of service to France, and that his spouse, Lauriane Doumbouya (née Darboux), is a French national with a background in the gendarmerie. Such biographical facts create a paradox: a leader with personal and professional ties to France now heads a regime that positions itself as defiant of Western-led regional constraints.
- This set of ties complicates bilateral relations (Franco‑Guinean) and complicates narratives of sovereignty and legitimacy inside Guinea — for opponents and supporters alike. Domestically, the leadership can assert independent agency by aligning with AES partners and alternative external suppliers; internationally, the leader’s past and personal connections may be invoked by critics or used as bargaining chips by external actors.

6. Security, humanitarian and economic implications
- Security: Logistical corridors and ports become strategic assets and potential targets. Any escalation (economic sanctions, maritime interdictions, or countermeasures) can produce choke points that adversaries or criminal groups exploit. Moreover, the tilt toward non‑Western security providers (including private military companies linked to outside powers) can reconfigure local force structures and human rights dynamics.
- Humanitarian and agricultural: Timely delivery of fertilizer and grain can avert acute food shortages and stabilize planting cycles, producing immediate welfare gains. However, reliance on politically mediated shipments risks creating chronic dependencies and may undermine longer-term efforts to diversify supply chains and build domestic resilience.
- Economic: Sustained routing of trade through alternative corridors affects port revenues, shipping patterns, and the commercial calculus of regional logistics firms. It can also lead to segmented regional markets, with attendant price and availability differentials.

7. Why this matters for India: alignments with Indian strategic culture and policy implications
India’s strategic culture emphasises strategic autonomy, pragmatic partnerships, maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), and the protection of economic and energy supply lines. The developments in Guinea and the Sahel carry distinct implications for Indian national security thinking and policy:

- Indian interests in African stability and development:
  - India maintains historical ties and growing economic engagement across West Africa. Instability or fragmentation of regional institutions that govern trade and humanitarian relief increases transaction costs for Indian firms and complicates consular and development efforts.
  - India’s development cooperation and Lines of Credit in agriculture, ports, and capacity building mean New Delhi has a stake in predictable regional governance and open logistics corridors.

- Maritime logistics and the security of supply chains:
  - While the primary theatre is West Africa, disruptions in port access and the politicization of maritime corridors signal broader risks to global shipping and commodity flows. India must therefore monitor the resilience of supply chains for fertilizers, grains, and critical commodities — all of which bear upon food security and agricultural planning at home.
  - The strategic use of ports by emergent partners (e.g., Russia) underscores the need for India to deepen its own maritime diplomacy, port cooperation, and logistics partnerships in Africa and the IOR to preserve options.

- Geopolitical competition and strategic autonomy:
  - India’s preference for non‑alignment and strategic autonomy leads it to avoid overt partisanship in internal political disputes; yet India must navigate a complex field where Western actors, Russia, and other powers actively court African partners. India’s choice architecture includes deeper economic engagement, capacity-building on governance and security, and multilateral diplomacy that supports rules-based regional institutions.
  - If rival powers consolidate influence by supplying security services, arms, or staple commodities in ways that translate into political leverage, India may find its own influence squeezed unless it strengthens tailored partnerships that respect partner sovereignty while promoting transparency and sustainability.

- Norms, legal frameworks, and institutional posture:
  - India’s diplomatic posture traditionally emphasizes sovereignty and non‑interference. However, the weakening of institutions like ECOWAS that enforce constitutional norms matters: it raises the risk of ungoverned spaces that become safe havens for violent non‑state groups, narcotics trafficking, or piracy, all of which have spillover effects for maritime routes vital to India.
  - India can reconcile its normative commitments with practical engagement by supporting capacity-building for regional governance (technical assistance, peacekeeping training, port management expertise) and by participating in multilateral humanitarian responses when required.

8. Policy considerations for Indian decision‑makers (analytical, not prescriptive)
- Monitor and map logistics corridors: Maintain an updated strategic mapping of West African ports, overland routes, and actors controlling them — including private military companies and foreign state‑linked suppliers.
- Diversify African partnerships: Augment economic and development ties with a range of coastal and Sahelian states to hedge against exclusive dependencies and to provide alternatives for states seeking impartial partners.
- Strengthen maritime diplomacy: Expand port cooperation, training programs, and capacity building for coastal states to secure stable access and to protect commercial shipping lanes.
- Support resilient agricultural supply chains: Provide technical assistance and finance for fertilizer production, storage, and distribution to reduce political vulnerability that arises from single-source dependency.
- Engage multilaterally: Work through AU, UN, and other multilateral instruments to support norms of constitutional order, while calibrating bilateral engagement to safeguard Indian nationals and commercial interests.
- Prepare contingency plans: For scenarios involving sanctions, supply disruptions, or sudden regimens of rule change, India should have contingency logistics and evacuation plans for its citizens, investments, and contracted projects.

Conclusion
Guinea’s facilitation of the AES through port access and its defiance of ECOWAS measures are more than regional curiosities: they are manifestations of a shifting architecture of influence, logistics, and legitimacy in West Africa. The transactional act of opening a seaport reverberates into strategic alignments, humanitarian outcomes, and great‑power competition. For India — whose strategic culture prizes autonomy, maritime reach, and stable external environments for trade and development — these developments require enhanced situational awareness, calibrated engagement, and investments in resilient partnerships that protect both Indian interests and regional stability.

## Case study: Senegal, ECOWAS and the Alliance of Sahel States — implications for regional integration and lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy

Summary
- In late 2024 Senegal’s President Bassirou Diomaye Faye publicly urged greater dialogue and cooperation between ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) and the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) on shared challenges — terrorism, climate change, and poverty. Yet in November 2024 Senegal implemented a concrete and coercive administrative measure: it barred the AES-issued passport and closed its borders to holders of Mali’s NINA national identity card. The measures prompted strong diplomatic protests from AES members (notably Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger) and provoked a debate over the durability of free‑movement regimes and regional integration in West Africa.
- This episode combines administrative technicalities (recognition of travel and identity documents) with high politics (sovereignty, legitimacy, and security). It therefore serves as a useful empirical vignette for understanding how regional institutional contestation, identity-credential recognition, and domestic security concerns can interact — and what that interaction implies for states managing border regimes and external partnerships. For Indian readers and policymakers, the case offers practical and conceptual lessons about how states balance regional commitments with national security, how non‑standard political regimes affect regional norms, and how document recognition can become a political lever.

Context and institutional background
- ECOWAS: A long-standing regional organisation whose founding mission included economic integration and the progressive liberalisation of cross‑border movement (a celebrated ECOWAS protocol on free movement). Recognition of member-state passports and IDs has been a practical foundation of these protocols.
- AES: A newer, politically charged formation among Sahelian governments — notably those that have come to power through military coups. AES has sought alternatives to established West African mechanisms and has issued its own travel documents and promoted intra‑AES mobility as a marker of political alignment.
- NINA: Mali’s national identity system; like any national ID, its acceptance abroad depends on reciprocal recognition by neighbour states and on perceptions of administrative reliability and the political legitimacy of the issuing authority.
- Why recognition matters: Decisions about whether to accept a passport or ID are not merely technical. Recognition conveys political legitimacy, affects citizens’ mobility, and can be used as a tool of diplomacy or coercion. Conversely, refusal to recognise can be read as delegitimising a regime or as an expression of security/administrative caution.

Actors and the specific measures
- Principal actors: Senegal (President Faye), ECOWAS institutions, AES members (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger among them).
- Measures taken by Senegal (November 2024): prohibition on the AES passport and closure of borders to holders of the NINA ID. These were discrete, administratively implementable actions with immediate effects on cross‑border movement.
- Reaction pattern: Formal complaints and diplomatic outcry from affected AES members; potential for reciprocal actions or escalation; immediate practical impacts on traders, seasonal labourers, and cross‑border families.

Interpreting the motivations: reading between the lines
- Political signalling and alignment: Senegal’s public call for ECOWAS–AES dialogue while simultaneously banning AES documents suggests a dual posture — advocating engagement in principle, but aligning administratively and politically with ECOWAS norms of document recognition. This can be interpreted as a calibrated attempt to assert sovereign control while reinforcing regional legal standards perceived as legitimate.
- Security and administrative caution: Border controls and document non‑recognition are often justified on grounds such as fears of infiltration by armed actors, irregular migration, document fraud, or administrative incompatibilities (databases, biometrics). Senegal’s measures may reflect genuine security concerns or a precautionary response to perceived vulnerabilities.
- Domestic politics: Leaders can deploy border restrictions to signal firmness on security or sovereignty to domestic audiences. Given the salience of cross‑border terrorism and migration in the Sahel, restrictive measures can serve domestic political ends.
- Sovereignty and legitimacy calculus: Refusal to accept IDs can be tantamount to partial non‑recognition of an issuing authority. For states that consider some neighbouring regimes illegitimate (e.g., due to military takeovers), document rejection becomes a diplomatic instrument.

Implications and consequences
- Diplomatic strain and fragmentation: The immediate consequence is reduced trust between Senegal and AES members, raising the risk of tit‑for‑tat measures and a breakdown of cooperative mechanisms. If persistent, such ruptures can harden geopolitical fault lines in the region.
- Erosion of free‑movement regimes: If member states selectively recognise documents, the normative and practical edifice of regional free movement weakens. The effectiveness of ECOWAS protocols depends on predictable mutual recognition; ad hoc rejections create legal and operational uncertainty.
- Humanitarian and socio‑economic costs: Traders, seasonal labourers, students, and families may be stranded or face onerous new administrative burdens. Economic flows in border regions — where formal trade and informal exchanges are vital — can contract, deepening vulnerability to poverty and instability.
- Security trade‑offs: Short‑term restriction may reduce some tactical threats (e.g., the ease of cross-border movement for certain actors), but it can simultaneously hamper intelligence-sharing, cooperative policing, and confidence‑building that underpin longer-term regional security efforts.
- Administrative and legal complications: The lack of harmonised identity standards (biometric interoperability, database access) complicates police and immigration work. It also raises questions about the legality of excluding recognized nationals and the recourse available to affected persons.
- Legitimacy effects: Non‑recognition communicates a normative judgment about issuing authorities and may delegitimise them internationally — with knock‑on effects for mediation efforts and attempts at negotiation.

Comparative lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
The Senegal–ECOWAS–AES episode has direct and indirect relevance to India. It illuminates structural dynamics that Indian strategists should factor into policy design, particularly in the contexts of neighbourhood management, regional institutions, diaspora protection, and border governance.

1. Recognition of documents as a strategic lever
- Lesson: Decisions about recognising passports and IDs are strategic acts that signal political positions and materially affect mobility. India, which deals with a range of regional partners (and non‑state mobility challenges), should treat document recognition as both an administrative task and a tool of diplomacy.
- Policy implication: Develop clear, transparent criteria for recognition/revocation of documents that balance security screening with humanitarian protections and that can be communicated diplomatically to avoid unintended escalation.

2. Managing relations with non‑conventional regimes
- Lesson: Engagement with military‑led or transitional regimes (as with AES members) complicates inter‑governmental norms. India’s pragmatic posture — preferring stability and functional engagement — must be calibrated to protect core interests (diaspora safety, trade) without automatically conferring legitimacy on actors whose actions contradict broader normative commitments.
- Policy implication: Maintain contingency protocols (consular, trade facilitation, security cooperation) that allow continued engagement on practical matters while reserving political recognition decisions for calibrated diplomatic lines.

3. Preserving regional norms for mobility while safeguarding security
- Lesson: Regional free‑movement regimes are fragile when trust and technical interoperability are weak. India’s involvement in regional architectures (e.g., BIMSTEC, IORA) should prioritise interoperable identity standards, data‑sharing protocols, and joint border management exercises to reduce the temptation for unilateral closures.
- Policy implication: Invest in technical harmonisation (secure digital IDs, biometric standards, mutually agreed verification channels) with partners to make mobility resilient against politicisation.

4. Protecting vulnerable populations and trade links
- Lesson: Administrative decisions have immediate human consequences. India’s policy toolkit should include migrant protection, rapid consular response, and mechanisms to facilitate cross‑border trade continuity in times of political strain.
- Policy implication: Establish standing contingency funds and quick‑response consular teams to assist nationals affected by abrupt recognition or border decisions; engage civil society and diaspora networks for early warning.

5. Intelligence and security cooperation trade‑offs
- Lesson: Border restrictions may temporarily limit mobility of hostile actors but can undercut long‑term cooperation (information‑sharing, coordinated operations). India must weigh immediate security gains against future cooperative dividends.
- Policy implication: Prioritise sustained, low‑visibility intelligence cooperation even when high‑level diplomatic relations are strained; use multilateral fora to institutionalise mechanisms that survive bilateral rifts.

Monitoring recommendations for policymakers and analysts
- Track diplomatic exchanges and public statements among Senegal, ECOWAS, and AES actors for indications of mediation, escalation, or reciprocity.
- Monitor operational indicators: border wait times, incidence of denied entry, changes in informal trade volumes, and reports of displaced or stranded persons in border zones.
- Seek clarity on legal rationales offered for non‑recognition (fraud concerns, security advisories, administrative incompatibility) and assess whether they are technical or politically motivated.
- Evaluate humanitarian impacts through partner organisations and diaspora networks; develop contingency assistance plans.
- Observe institutional responses from ECOWAS and other regional bodies — do they enforce protocols, seek arbitration, or accept differentiated state behaviour? The institutional resilience will shape long‑term outcomes.
- For India: maintain situational awareness of similar dynamics in India’s neighbourhood (e.g., document disputes, border closures) and assess implications for trade corridors, supply chains, and diaspora safety.

Concluding reflection: institutional legitimacy, technical interoperability, and strategic prudence
The Senegal—ECOWAS—AES episode crystallises a persistent tension in regional governance: the overlap between technical administrative practice (recognising an ID) and geopolitical signalling (recognising a government). For a state’s strategic culture, the episode underscores three enduring principles:
- Norms matter: Regional commitments to free movement and mutual recognition provide political goods (economic integration, predictability). Erosion of these norms has cascading costs.
- Technical capacity underpins politics: Interoperable identity systems, secure databases, and agreed verification protocols reduce the space for politicised denial and make regional regimes more resilient.
- Pragmatism tempered by principle: States must combine pragmatic engagement (to maintain cooperation and protect citizens) with principled policies (to avoid unintended legitimisation of actors whose behaviour threatens regional stability).

For Indian strategic culture and national security policy, these principles argue for a calibrated approach: deepen technical cooperation with regional partners, institutionalise mechanisms that protect mobility and trade in crises, and use recognition decisions transparently and sparingly — always anticipating the humanitarian and diplomatic reverberations such acts can generate.

## Chapter X: Togo — Engagement with the Alliance of Sahel States (AES): Initiatives, Risks and Strategic Lessons

Introduction

Togo’s diplomatic and economic outreach to the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) since late 2024 illustrates how a small coastal state can pursue pragmatic regional engagement that mixes economic opportunity, security cooperation and diplomatic entrepreneurship. For observers of regional order and for states such as India interested in the dynamics of middle and small powers, Togo’s strategy is instructive: it shows both the opportunities inherent in acting as a logistical and convening hub for neighbouring blocs, and the political and reputational trade‑offs that accompany alignment with controversial regimes. This section analyses Togo’s initiatives toward the AES, the domestic and regional drivers behind them, implementation challenges, and the broader strategic implications — including comparative lessons for policymakers concerned with strategic culture and national security policy.

Background: AES, Togo and the evolving West African landscape

The Alliance of Sahel States (also called the Confederation of Sahel States) arose out of cooperation among Sahel governments led by military juntas — notably Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — seeking a regional security compact in the face of insurgency, state fragility and contested external partnerships. The AES represents both a security response and a political realignment in the Sahel, with implications for coastal West African states and for regional organisations such as ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States).

Togo, a coastal ECOWAS member with the deepwater port of Lomé and a tradition of diplomatic activism, has positioned itself as a practical partner for AES members. This positioning reflects geographic opportunity (serving landlocked Sahel countries), domestic politics, and an ambition to act as a regional convenor on peace and security. At the centre of this strategy is Togo’s launch of the Global Peace and Security Alliance (GPSA) and parallel economic measures to facilitate Sahel access to coastal infrastructure.

Key initiatives and timeline

- November 2024 — Togo announces the Global Peace and Security Alliance (GPSA) at the Lomé Peace and Security Forum. The GPSA is designed to gather existing peace and security platforms and to position Togo as a convenor of multilateral dialogue.
- January 2025 — Foreign Minister Robert Dussey states that Togo has not ruled out joining the AES: “It’s not impossible.” This publicly signals the Togolese government’s openness to closer formal ties.
- March 2025 — Dussey reaffirms Togo’s consideration of AES membership; a domestic poll reports majority public support for joining the AES.
- 30 May 2025 — Togo and Burkina Faso implement an agreement eliminating incoming-call roaming charges, a visible, low‑cost measure deepening bilateral ties.
- Ongoing (2025) — Negotiations between Togo and AES members over an interconnected customs area and preferential port/tariff arrangements to enable landlocked AES members greater, lower-cost access to Lomé port.

Actors and interests

- Togolese government and Foreign Minister Robert Dussey: pursue diplomatic entrepreneurship, leverage Lomé’s port, enhance regional influence.
- Alliance of Sahel States (AES): seek secure, lower-cost access to the sea and regional partners that recognise or legitimise their security agenda.
- Landlocked AES members (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger): desire reliable transit corridors, tariff relief and customs interoperability to lower logistics costs.
- ECOWAS: concerned about shifting regional alignments and the implications of AES access to coastal infrastructure.
- Lomé port and Togolese customs authorities: stand to gain increased throughput and revenue, but face administrative and enforcement challenges.
- External partners and donors (Western states, multilateral lenders): their reaction could include diplomatic pressure or conditionality depending on how alignment with AES affects governance and human rights considerations.

The GPSA: convening platform and geopolitical signalling

Togo’s GPSA initiative has two complementary dimensions. First, as a practical convening mechanism, the GPSA can aggregate diverse peace and security actors, create dialogue channels and host confidence‑building measures. Second, the GPSA signals Togo’s intent to exercise soft power in regional security diplomacy — positioning Lomé as a neutral or at least active seat of mediation and cooperation. For AES engagement, the GPSA gives Togo multilateral cover: bilateral rapprochement with AES members can be framed within a broader, ostensibly inclusive security architecture rather than as exclusive alignment.

Domestic politics and public opinion

A March 2025 poll indicating majority Togolese support for AES membership is politically consequential. Popular backing provides the government with domestic legitimacy to pursue deeper engagement and can blunt criticism of perceived concessions to Sahel juntas. However, public opinion can be sensitive to the economic outcomes of closer ties (e.g., whether port revenues translate into local benefits) and to any diplomatic costs (loss of aid, trade preferences). Transparent public communication and clear cost–benefit framing will be essential to preserve the government’s social licence.

Economic integration: customs interoperability and port access

Negotiations to create an “interconnected customs area” and to reduce tariffs for AES members’ use of Lomé port are driven by mutual economic logic. For landlocked Sahel states, access to a nearby deepwater port with lower tariffs materially reduces logistics costs and supports trade. For Togo, higher cargo throughput can increase port revenues, stimulate related services and strengthen Lomé’s regional hub status.

But the economics are not automatic. Effective implementation requires:

- Harmonised customs regulations, documentation and IT systems to allow seamless transit and prevent bottlenecks.
- Revenue‑sharing arrangements and transparent tariff formulas to compensate coastal states fairly while delivering genuine savings to Sahel shippers.
- Robust anti‑smuggling and oversight mechanisms to prevent revenue leakage and illicit trade.
- Infrastructure investments (road, rail, storage) to absorb increased volumes.

Absent these elements, tariff concessions may erode public revenue, and logistics inefficiencies could limit gains for both Togo and AES partners.

Low‑cost confidence building: telecom agreement

The 30 May 2025 elimination of incoming-call roaming charges between Togo and Burkina Faso is emblematic of pragmatic, high-visibility cooperation. Such telecom accords lower transaction costs for business and personal communications, increase social connectivity, and generate positive public sentiment. They are also useful diplomatic tools: visible benefits that prefigure deeper, more complex agreements.

Security cooperation, reputational risks and sanctions exposure

Deeper security cooperation with AES members can bring operational advantages—shared intelligence, coordinated border control, and cooperative responses to transnational threats. Yet alignment with military‑led regimes risks diplomatic pushback from ECOWAS and from Western partners. Potential consequences include: strained relations within ECOWAS, suspension of security or development assistance, or targeted sanctions by external actors if partnerships are seen as legitimising anti‑democratic governance.

Strategic and regional implications

- Regional realignment potential: Togo’s rapprochement with the AES suggests that the coastal–Sahel divide can be bridged, potentially leading to new asymmetrical networks that reconfigure West African alignments.
- Increased strategic value of Lomé port: If Lomé successfully becomes a reliable gateway for Sahel trade, Togo’s economic and diplomatic leverage in regional affairs will grow.
- ECOWAS tensions: Facilitating AES logistics and transit risks exacerbating competition with ECOWAS policy positions and could create friction over regional governance norms.
- Balancing act and diplomatic hedging: Togo will need to manage relations carefully to avoid isolation — maintaining ties with external partners and ECOWAS while deepening practical cooperation with AES members.

Implementation challenges

Operationalising customs interoperability and tariff arrangements is technically and institutionally demanding:

- Legal and regulatory harmonisation across sovereign systems is complex and time‑consuming.
- IT integration for customs clearance requires investment, cyber‑security safeguards and staff training.
- Revenue allocation mechanisms must be transparent to avoid fiscal shortfalls and disputes.
- Border governance must address smuggling, contraband and corruption risks that thrive where regulatory asymmetries exist.
- Security arrangements should avoid open‑ended commitments that could entangle Togo in external political or military obligations.

Recommendations (policy guidance)

The following measures would mitigate risks while enabling Togo (and interested partners) to realise potential gains:

1. Conduct rigorous legal and economic impact assessments before formalising customs interoperability and tariff waivers. Quantify revenue implications, model cargo throughput scenarios and design compensatory mechanisms for potential fiscal shortfalls.

2. Adopt phased, reversible implementation steps. Begin with pilot customs corridors and time‑bound tariff pilots to test operational arrangements and gather data before scaling up.

3. Build robust institutional and technological capacity. Invest in interoperable customs IT systems, staff training, and anti‑fraud controls; consider third‑party audits to enhance transparency.

4. Pursue parallel diplomacy. Engage ECOWAS, key bilateral partners and donors proactively to explain the economic rationale, minimise misunderstandings and seek technical or financial support where possible.

5. Define clear, limited security cooperation terms. Avoid ambiguous commitments that could draw Togo into punitive countermeasures; prioritise narrowly defined, mutually beneficial security tasks (e.g., counter‑trafficking, port security).

6. Maintain transparent domestic communication. Explain expected benefits and risks to the Togolese public, and create feedback mechanisms that can adjust policy in response to outcomes.

7. Use the GPSA as a multilateral hedge. Frame AES engagement within broader GPSA activities to reduce perceptions of exclusive alignment and to diversify partnerships.

Comparative insights for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Togo’s approach underscores several themes that resonate with India’s strategic calculus and broader lessons for states balancing economic opportunity with reputational concerns:

- Small and medium powers can leverage geographic endowments (ports, transit corridors) to amplify diplomatic influence. India’s own emphasis on connectivity and economic diplomacy — for example, in the Indian Ocean region — reflects similar logic: infrastructure and logistics can be strategic levers.
- Convening platforms matter. The GPSA demonstrates how hosting multilateral forums can confer soft power and create diplomatic space to manage complex alignments. India’s long‑standing practice of convening (e.g., IBSA Forum, CICA-like initiatives) similarly projects normative leadership.
- Phased, reversible policies reduce strategic risk. Togo’s recommended pilots mirror a wider best practice: incremental integration allows for course correction. India’s approach to strategic partnerships often favours calibrated engagement, testing cooperation areas before deeper commitments.
- Balancing trade and values is perennial. Togo’s potential reputational cost in engaging AES mirrors dilemmas India faces when partnering with states whose governance records are contested. Strategic culture that emphasises strategic autonomy, diversified partnerships and transactional prudence helps manage such trade‑offs.
- Technical foundations (customs, IT, transparent revenue sharing) are decisive. Strategic outcomes depend on administrative competence as much as on diplomatic will — a point relevant for India’s external economic initiatives, where implementation capacity shapes credibility.

Conclusion

Togo’s engagement with the Alliance of Sahel States is a case study in pragmatic regionalism: a small coastal state seeking economic opportunity and diplomatic significance by linking its port and convening capacity to the needs of hinterland partners. The approach offers tangible benefits but entails political, reputational and implementation risks. For policymakers and scholars interested in strategic culture, Togo’s strategy highlights the importance of multilateral framing, gradualism in integration, technical preparedness and domestic legitimacy in pursuing foreign policy initiatives that sit at the intersection of economics, security and regional politics. For external actors — including India — the episode reinforces that infrastructure diplomacy and convening power can enhance influence, but only when accompanied by transparent governance, safeguards against illicit flows, and careful diplomatic balancing to preserve broader strategic partnerships.

### Section: Regional Engagement, Multilateralism and the Security–Development Nexus — Ghana’s Sahel Initiative as a Case Study for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Introduction

This section examines a recent West African policy cluster — President‑elect John Dramani Mahama’s public initiative to support the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), Ghana’s diplomatisation toward the Sahel, and the outgoing administration’s visa‑free decision for African passport holders — as a compact case study with direct analytic relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy. The Ghana example illuminates how a middle power’s domestic political change, diplomatic signalling and economic policy choices interact with regional security architectures (AES, ECOWAS, AU/AfCFTA) and multilateral creditors (IMF). For Indian strategists, the episode offers lessons on: (a) leveraging diplomatic capital to influence regional stability; (b) sequencing economic and security policies; (c) managing relations with competing regional blocs; and (d) designing policy instruments (envoys, visa regimes, conditionality renegotiations) to advance national and regional objectives while mitigating risks.

Key facts and timeline

- 7 December 2024 — John Dramani Mahama elected president‑elect of Ghana.  
- 18 December 2024 — Outgoing President Nana Akufo‑Addo approved visa‑free entry for all African passport holders (policy to take effect 6 January 2025).  
- 6 January 2025 — Ghana’s visa‑free policy for all African passport holders comes into force.  
- 21 January 2025 — Ghana appointed Larry Gbevlo‑Lartey as special envoy to the Confederation/Alliance of Sahel States.

Background: Actors, institutions and regional context

- Alliance of Sahel States (AES): A regional security/political grouping, formed by states confronting jihadist insurgencies in the central and western Sahel (notably Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger among others). AES has emerged as a vehicle for member states to coordinate security responses outside, and sometimes in tension with, ECOWAS.  
- ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States): The principal West African regional bloc with collective security, economic and democratic governance mandates. ECOWAS has both normative commitments (democracy, human rights) and operational instruments for collective action, but relations with some Sahel states have been strained following coups and unilateral security choices by those regimes.  
- African Union / AfCFTA: Continental frameworks promoting integration (trade and ultimately freer movement). The AfCFTA and AU free‑movement initiatives provide normative and practical scaffolding for unilateral national measures such as visa liberalisation.  
- IMF and external creditors: Multilateral lending institutions whose programmes and conditionalities shape domestic macroeconomic policy and thus influence a state’s diplomatic capacity and room for external assistance.

Ghana’s policy cluster: what was done and why it matters

1. Political‑diplomatic initiative to support AES
   - President‑elect Mahama publicly urged West African neighbours and international organisations — explicitly naming ECOWAS — to address the Sahel crisis and to support the AES in combating terrorism. He framed the Sahel as a regional hub for extremist activity whose instability threatens the wider West African basin.
   - Significance: A new Ghanaian administration signalling readiness to engage more actively in Sahel security diplomacy and operational support. This both reasserts Ghana’s regional leadership ambitions and attempts to bridge fractured relations between AES members and ECOWAS/AU actors.

2. Appointment of a special envoy
   - On 21 January 2025 Ghana appointed Larry Gbevlo‑Lartey as special envoy to the Confederation/Alliance of Sahel States to manage relations and act as a channel between Ghana and AES members.
   - Significance: Envoys serve as low‑risk, high‑signal instruments to open dialogue, reduce misperceptions and mediate between competing regional actors. This reflects a preference for diplomatic engagement before, or alongside, more intrusive security measures.

3. Visa‑free entry for all African passport holders
   - Approved 18 December 2024 by the outgoing president and effective 6 January 2025, Ghana became the fifth African country to allow entry to all African passport holders without visa.
   - Significance: The policy is presented as coherent with AU integration goals (AfCFTA and movement initiatives) and could enhance trade, tourism and people‑to‑people exchanges. It is also a soft‑power instrument that strengthens continental linkages and signals Ghana’s pan‑African orientation.

4. Economic policy pivot: intention to seek revised IMF terms
   - Mahama indicated plans to renegotiate IMF terms to stabilise Ghana’s economy — a potential shift from the predecessor’s choices.
   - Significance: Fiscal space and macroeconomic stability matter for foreign policy capacity. Renegotiation can create short‑term relief but may entail domestic reforms and international trade‑offs.

Analytical themes and implications

1. Multilateralism versus regional fragmentation
   - Ghana’s approach simultaneously invokes ECOWAS and AES, revealing the complexity of operating in an environment of overlapping, sometimes competing regional formations. For policymakers, this underscores the need to avoid unilateralism while recognising novel regional groupings born of shared security pressures.
   - For India: engagement with regions that exhibit overlapping institutions (e.g., Gulf, Indo‑Pacific configurations, African sub‑regions) must be calibrated to manage institutional friction and exploit complementarities.

2. Diplomatic signalling and mediation
   - The special‑envoy model is a strategic instrument for middle powers to assume mediator roles, reduce polarisation, and create space for multilateral cooperation. Appointing an envoy communicates seriousness without immediate security entanglement.
   - For India: deploying envoys, special representatives or resident coordinators in conflict‑prone subregions can amplify India’s convening leverage and provide pathways for conflict de‑escalation and cooperation.

3. Security–development nexus
   - Support to the Sahel must combine security assistance (training, intelligence sharing, capacity building) with governance and development efforts. Otherwise, short‑term kinetic gains may be undercut by long‑term grievances that fuel militancy.
   - For India: any security cooperation in Africa or elsewhere should be embedded in development and institution‑building packages; India’s capacity for training, infrastructure projects and development finance can be tailored to this integrated approach.

4. Economic policy, external creditors and foreign policy bandwidth
   - Seeking revised IMF terms signals that domestic macroeconomic choices influence external engagement. Fiscal constraints limit the ability to provide assistance or sustain abroad deployments; conversely, relief can buttress diplomatic activism.
   - For India: macroeconomic resilience is a national security variable. India’s external economic commitments and soft power investments will be better sustained if domestic fiscal policy preserves policy space.

5. Mobility regimes as geopolitical tools
   - Visa‑free access for Africans is both a normative alignment with AU integration and a pragmatic instrument to boost connectivity. However, it requires parallel investments in border management, biometric systems and coordination to preclude security leakages.
   - For India: visa regimes are a low‑cost soft‑power lever. Expanding visa access to certain regions can deepen ties, but must be matched with counter‑illicit‑migration and security screening capacities.

Operational considerations and risks

- Clarify objective mix: Any support to the AES should specify whether it is military, intelligence, humanitarian or development‑oriented. Ambiguity risks mission creep and reputational costs if activities contravene international norms.
- Legal mandates and human rights safeguards: Security assistance must be accompanied by clear legal frameworks, rules of engagement and human‑rights oversight to avoid complicity in abuses and to preserve legitimacy with partners like ECOWAS and the AU.
- Coordination with regional/international partners: To prevent duplication or contradictory policies, efforts should be harmonised with ECOWAS, AU, UN missions and external partners (EU, France, UN, bilateral), respecting the sensitivities of AES members who may distrust certain actors.
- Migration and border management: Visa liberalisation heightens the need for effective entry‑exit monitoring, identity systems and cross‑border information sharing; without them, mobility gains can be offset by security externalities.
- Political polarisation and alignment risks: Engaging with AES without an inclusive regional strategy risks amplifying tensions between ECOWAS and AES, potentially making Ghana (or any external partner) a polarising actor.

Policy recommendations — mapping to Indian strategic choices

For Indian policymakers designing foreign policy and security strategies that engage unstable regions and multilateral architectures, the Ghana case suggests the following actionable guidelines:

1. Use envoys and special representatives strategically
   - Deploy envoys to manage difficult regional relationships and act as mediators among competing sub‑regional blocs. Such appointments are low‑cost, high‑signal and can preserve operational flexibility.

2. Link security cooperation to development and governance
   - Ensure military or intelligence assistance is conditioned on governance reforms, institution‑building and socio‑economic investments to address root causes of instability.

3. Preserve macroeconomic space for external engagement
   - Domestic fiscal prudence enhances the state’s capacity to sustain foreign policy initiatives. Coordination between finance and foreign ministries is necessary when planning international assistance or deployments.

4. Coordinate across multilateral layers
   - Map and engage simultaneously with continental (AU), regional (sub‑regional blocs), and international partners to reduce strategic fragmentation. India should leverage its multilateral credentials to act as a convener and honest broker where appropriate.

5. Design mobility policies with security safeguards
   - Expand visa facilitation and people‑to‑people ties as tools of influence, while building biometric and intelligence capacities to mitigate abuse and transnational criminality.

6. Manage reputational and human‑rights risks
   - Attach human‑rights conditionalities and oversight to security cooperation; ensure transparency, parliamentary oversight and civil‑society consultation to sustain domestic legitimacy.

Lessons for India’s strategic culture

- Middle‑power diplomacy: Ghana’s blend of principled multilateralism (aligning with AU/AfCFTA) and pragmatic, regionally targeted diplomacy (envoy to AES) reflects a middle‑power playbook India can adapt: normative alignment with large multilateral frameworks while applying focused diplomacy in strategic subregions.
- Flexibility and hybridity: Operating across competing regional organisations requires hybrid strategies that mix mediation, aid, capacity building and selective security engagement — a posture consonant with India’s historical preference for non‑entanglement coupled with proactive diplomacy.
- Domestic policy coherence: The episode demonstrates the necessity of aligning domestic economic policy (including IMF relations) with foreign policy ambitions. Strategic culture that prizes autonomy must ensure that macroeconomic choices sustain the state’s international commitments.
- Norms and instruments: Soft power instruments (visa policies, development cooperation, envoy diplomacy) can be as consequential as hard power. India’s strategic culture, oriented toward persuasion and partnership rather than coercion, can amplify gains by prioritising these tools.

Conclusion

Ghana’s recent engagement with the Sahel — public appeals to support the AES, appointment of a special envoy, and continental‑oriented visa liberalisation paired to an anticipated re‑negotiation of IMF terms — forms a compact policy cluster that illustrates the interplay of diplomacy, economic policy and regional institutional navigation. For India, the case offers concrete lessons about middle‑power manoeuvring in environments of overlapping regional institutions, the importance of combining security action with development, and the need to synchronise domestic macroeconomics with external ambitions. Indian strategic culture, which privileges strategic autonomy, normative multilateralism and calibrated engagement, can adopt these instruments while carefully managing legal, human‑rights and coordination risks.

Points of attention for Indian policymakers (summary checklist)

- Define objectives clearly before offering support to sub‑regional security groupings.  
- Ensure legal mandates, oversight and human‑rights safeguards accompany security cooperation.  
- Invest in border and migration management if adopting liberalised mobility policies.  
- Coordinate IMF or other creditor negotiations with foreign policy plans to preserve fiscal space.  
- Use envoys to open channels and mediate between competing regional actors.  
- Prioritise integrated security–development packages to address root causes of instability.

This Ghana‑Sahel vignette thus functions both as an explanatory example of how middle powers navigate complex regional security environments and as a source of practical policy lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security practice.

## Chapter X: Cross-Border Incidents and Regional Order — The 31 March 2025 Drone Shootdown and Its Implications for the Sahel and Indian Strategic Posture

Introduction

On 31 March 2025 an armed drone operated by Mali was reportedly shot down close to the Mali–Algeria frontier. The incident rapidly transcended a bilateral airspace dispute to become a flashpoint in Sahel diplomacy. The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) characterized the shootdown as a violation of international law and went further, framing the event as "proof" of state-sponsored terrorism by Algeria. Mali rejected Algerian claims that the drone had entered Algerian airspace, announced that it would lodge complaints with international bodies, and withdrew its ambassador to Algiers. Official Malian statements justified the drone's mission as part of neutralization efforts against armed groups responsible for terrorist attacks. The aggregate effect has been to widen a rift between Algeria and the AES membership and to complicate regional counterterrorism cooperation.

This section analyses the facts, legal yardsticks, diplomatic dynamics, security risks, and mediation pathways arising from the incident, and draws out lessons and policy implications relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security policy — particularly for Indian diplomacy in multilateral fora, its posture on regional mediation, and its approach to evidence-based dispute resolution.

1. Factual contours and operational ambiguity

- Core facts and competing claims: Reports indicate a Malian drone was destroyed near the Algerian border on 31 March 2025. Algeria asserts the drone violated its sovereign airspace and was therefore engaged over Algerian territory; Mali and AES deny this, maintaining the drone remained in Malian airspace and that its destruction impeded counterterrorism efforts. AES’s escalation to a charge of "state-sponsored terrorism" significantly raises the political stakes.
- Missing factual elements that determine legal and diplomatic outcomes: objective geolocation of the wreckage; radar tracks and flight data; which platform or unit engaged the drone; identifiable wreckage or serial numbers; the drone’s declared mission and flight plan; and any contemporaneous communications or satellite imagery. Without transparent, independently verifiable evidence, adjudicating the legality of the shootdown remains contested and politically charged.
- Why operational clarity matters: the difference between an airspace violation and a cross-border interdiction determines whether this is primarily an aviation incident subject to ICAO norms, an inter-state use-of-force question under the UN Charter, or an internal security action with cross-border repercussions. Each legal framing prescribes different diplomatic and institutional responses.

2. AES, regional politics, and the symbolic weaponization of allegations

- AES context: The Alliance of Sahel States — comprising the ruling military governments of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger — emerged as a regional bloc that asserts sovereignty and resists perceived external interference. Its members have been sensitive to any actions that could be read as support for domestic opponents or as infringing national independence.
- Strategic meaning of the "state-sponsored terrorism" allegation: That label is deliberately inflammatory. It not only delegitimizes the accused state politically but also can be a pretext for coordinated punitive measures, suspension of cooperation, or appeals to sympathetic international audiences. Such charges elevate what might have been a technical airspace dispute into a justification for collective countermeasures by AES members and their allies.
- Domestic and international signaling: AES and Mali’s pronouncements aim at domestic legitimacy (portraying governments as defenders against foreign hostility) and regional solidarity. Algeria’s prior role as mediator in Malian affairs gives the episode additional irony: a former facilitator has now become an accused party in the eyes of the AES.

3. Legal frameworks: airspace, state responsibility, and evidentiary standards

- Governing law: Sovereignty over airspace is a foundational principle of international aviation law embodied in the Chicago Convention (1944). States have exclusive rights to regulate and defend their airspace. However, the use of force across borders — even to interdict non-state actors — invokes the UN Charter’s prohibitions and exceptions, and customary international law on self-defence or consent.
- Standards of proof and institutional pathways: Proving an airspace violation typically requires objective evidence (radar logs, flight record data, wreckage coordinates, satellite imagery). ICAO provides technical and investigative mechanisms for civil aviation incidents; the International Civil Aviation Organization can assist with fact-finding regarding air navigation and civil aircraft incidents. For allegations of unlawful use of force or state sponsorship of terrorism, the UN Security Council, the African Union, or ad hoc investigative commissions might be invoked.
- Consequences of evidentiary opacity: Where transparent evidence is absent, political allocation of credibility — shaped by alliances, rhetoric, and domestic politics — tends to drive outcomes more than legal determinations. That politicization raises the risk of miscalculation and prolonged diplomatic rupture.

4. Diplomatic escalation short of war: the withdrawal of an ambassador and other measures

- Ambassadorial recall as calibrated escalation: Mali’s withdrawal of its ambassador to Algeria is a classic diplomatic sanction — signaling strong disapproval while preserving the possibility of future normalization. It complicates routine bilateral cooperation: security coordination on border management, intelligence exchanges, trade facilitation, and migration administration can all suffer.
- Potential reciprocal measures and threshold effects: If the parties trade further sanctions, border restrictions, suspension of agreements, or increased military posturing, the political temperature can rise quickly. Escalatory dynamics in such contexts often have nonlinear consequences for regional stability and for the operating space of international organizations.

5. Security, humanitarian, and operational consequences for the Sahel

- Immediate security consequences: Deteriorating bilateral relations threaten cross-border intelligence-sharing, joint operations, and arrest/extradition processes — all of which are critical in contesting violent extremist organizations whose operational patterns ignore political borders.
- Humanitarian dimensions: Disruption of cross-border coordination can impede humanitarian access and complicate refugee and internally displaced persons (IDP) flows. Increased insecurity tends to deepen humanitarian crises and frustrate relief operations.
- Strategic openings for external actors and non-state groups: Fragmentation among regional states creates opportunities for external powers to cultivate influence and for insurgent groups to exploit jurisdictional seams. This dynamic can alter local balances of power and prolong conflict.

6. Internationalization and escalation pathways

- Institutional fora for contestation: Mali’s intention to file a complaint opens multiple avenues — the UN Security Council for political security adjudication; ICAO for technical aviation investigation; the African Union or subregional bodies for political mediation and dispute resolution. Each forum has different decision-making logics and political constraints.
- Risks of securitization and contagion: If AES members mobilize collective responses, or if accusations of state sponsorship of terrorism stick in international discourse, broader diplomatic isolation of Algeria by certain partners could ensue, or conversely, Algeria could find sympathetic states that see AES actions as destabilizing. Either dynamic risks widening the dispute.
- Third-party involvement: Neutral external parties (the AU, UN, ECOWAS, or a neutral state) can provide investigative capacity and mediating leverage — but their effectiveness depends on perceived impartiality and the willingness of parties to accept findings.

7. Mediation, verification, and confidence-building: practical pathways to de-escalation

- Immediate priorities: (a) procure and share objective evidence — radar data, debris coordinates, eyewitness accounts, satellite imagery — ideally through an independent investigatory mechanism; (b) re-establish direct communication channels between military and diplomatic authorities to prevent miscalculation; (c) agree on temporary confidence-building measures (e.g., notified drone corridors, hotlines, or sitting arrangements between security chiefs).
- Institutionalizing fact-finding: An ICAO-facilitated technical investigation of the incident would address flight-path and air-navigation questions. Parallel political mediation could be convened by the African Union or a neutral lead state, with the UN providing political support where appropriate.
- Leveraging Algeria’s mediator legacy: Algeria previously played constructive mediator roles in Mali. Restoring that credibility could enable Algeria to shift from accused to facilitator — but only if independent verification can credibly clear or delineate its responsibility.

8. Evidence, transparency, and credibility as determinants of political outcomes

- The decisive role of independent evidence: Transparent, technical verification is the most credible basis for resolving competing claims and limiting politicization. Where such verification is accepted, it creates a platform for remediation and normalization.
- The danger of narrative wars: Absent proof, competing narratives fill the vacuum. AES accusations of state-sponsored terrorism may resonate regionally and with certain international audiences, whereas Algeria’s security concerns may find sympathy elsewhere. Narrative dominance can harden positions and reduce the efficacy of institutional dispute resolution.
- Responsibility of international actors: External states and multilateral bodies have a responsibility to insist on independent verification rather than reflexively adopting politicized claims. Doing so preserves norms and reduces incentives to weaponize accusations.

9. Policy recommendations: stabilizing measures for regional actors and international stakeholders — and lessons for India

For regional actors and international partners:
- Prioritize an independent, technically robust investigation (ICAO or a jointly mandated AU–UN panel) that can establish facts on airspace, weapons employment, and responsible actors.
- Maintain open diplomatic channels and avoid reciprocal escalatory measures that close off avenues for fact-finding; ambassadorial recalls should be accompanied by offers for mediated inquiry, not immediate severance.
- Safeguard and reinforce cross-border counterterrorism cooperation even amid diplomatic disagreements through neutral, technical bodies and humanitarian safeguards.
- Resist politicized labels (e.g., "state-sponsored terrorism") absent substantiating evidence, because they are difficult to retract and can institutionalize conflict.

For India — implications through the lens of strategic culture and national security policy:
- India’s inclination toward principled multilateralism and evidence-based diplomacy points to several actionable stances: advocate for and support independent technical investigation mechanisms (ICAO, AU/UN panels) rather than taking partisan positions based on political sympathies.
- Diplomatic posture: India should emphasize respect for sovereignty and legal norms while recognizing the operational challenges posed by transnational insurgency. This balance aligns with India’s strategic culture of principled non-interference combined with pragmatic engagement on regional security.
- Mediation and capacity-building roles: India can offer technical assistance (radar modernization, surveillance interoperability, training in investigation methodology) and logistical support to multilateral fact-finding efforts. India’s experience in peacekeeping and policing can be useful in capacity-building for investigative and humanitarian responses.
- Multilateral professionalization: Encourage institutionalization of neutral mechanisms within African regional organizations and the UN to handle cross-border security incidents so that disputes do not spiral into politicized contests — a preference consistent with India’s long-standing support for multilateral dispute settlement.
- Strategic caution in rhetoric: India’s strategic culture emphasizes calibrated language. Public statements should call for restraint, independent verification, and preservation of humanitarian space, reducing the risk that rhetoric will compound instability or encourage external competition.

Conclusion

The 31 March 2025 drone shootdown near the Mali–Algeria border illustrates how apparently localized operational incidents can rapidly acquire strategic salience when they intersect with fragile regional politics, competing narratives, and weak evidentiary bases. The incident threatens to fray vital security cooperation against transnational violent extremist groups in the Sahel and to widen geopolitical openings for external actors.

For the international system — and for India in particular — the episode underscores the primacy of transparent, technical verification; the value of calibrated, multilateral diplomacy; and the importance of measured, evidence-based rhetoric. India’s strategic culture and national security policy equip it to advocate for such an approach: supporting neutral investigations, offering capacity-building assistance, promoting regional institutional responses, and urging restraint to prevent escalation. Those responses best protect civilians, preserve norms of sovereignty and non-use of force, and sustain the cooperative architecture needed to address the common threat posed by violent non-state actors in the Sahel and beyond.

## Chapter X: The Sahel Realignment — The Alliance of Sahel States’ Pivot from France and What It Means for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Executive summary  
The Alliance of Sahel States (AES) — principally Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso — has undertaken a rapid and visible reorientation of external partnerships since 2023–2025, severing several traditional links to France and Francophone institutions and actively cultivating relationships with a range of non‑Western actors: Russia (including Rosatom and private military contractors), Turkey, China, Iran, and, in some reports, actors from North Korea and Afghanistan. The AES’s moves include withdrawal from the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), high‑profile nuclear cooperation agreements with Russia, the presence of private military companies (notably Wagner), new Turkish and Iranian security/economic accords, and diplomatic ruptures with Ukraine. These developments carry immediate security, diplomatic, humanitarian and non‑proliferation risks for the Sahel itself and generate a set of second‑order strategic challenges and opportunities for external states — including India. For Indian policymakers they present a test of strategic culture: how to harmonise strategic autonomy and pragmatic engagement with India’s normative commitments to non‑proliferation, human rights and multilateralism.

1. Background: the AES, the Francophone architecture and the impulse to realign  
- The Alliance of Sahel States emerged in a context of successive coups, governance crises and intensifying Islamist insurgencies across the central Sahel. Historically, the Sahel states’ security, administrative and cultural links to France and Francophone networks (OIF) were integral to their diplomatic orientation, training pipelines, and assistance flows.  
- The suspension of AES members from many Western partnerships after coups, and rising anti‑French public sentiment, catalysed an active search for alternatives — both to assert sovereignty and to secure immediate military, financial and technical support. Withdrawal from the OIF in March 2025 was simultaneously symbolic (a break with French cultural/diplomatic networks) and practical (reducing perceived conditionality and opening space for new partners). For external observers, this marks a strategic pivot with real consequences for regional alignments.

2. Drivers of the pivot: why AES states turned outward to non‑Western partners  
- Immediate operational needs: rapidly deteriorating security situations, limited state capacity, and acute service delivery shortfalls (for example severe electricity shortages in Burkina Faso, where electrification was estimated around 20% in mid‑2025) made large, fast promises from external actors attractive.  
- Political legitimacy and anti‑Western narratives: domestic elites and juntas framed Western criticism as neocolonial interference; partnering with other states allowed them to present alternative sovereignty narratives.  
- Opportunity structure: Russia, Turkey, China and others offered packages — military support, construction, investment, and in Russia’s case high‑technology cooperation (nuclear and satellite claims) — often tied to fewer overt governance conditions.

3. New partnerships in practice: agreements, actors and modalities

3.1 Russia: nuclear cooperation, private military contractors, and space claims  
- Nuclear cooperation: In June 2025, Russia signed agreements with Burkina Faso and Mali purporting to foster “peaceful uses” of atomic energy: assistance on regulatory frameworks, training, infrastructural development and the potential for power reactors. Rosatom’s model typically bundles financing proposals, construction, fuel supply and long‑term service contracts. Such offers are politically potent in energy‑starved contexts but technically and institutionally demanding.  
- Private military contractors (PMC): The Wagner Group’s presence in Mali and further AES states has been used to provide counter‑insurgency assistance. PMC deployments frequently coincide with opaque contracting, unclear chains of accountability and credible allegations of human rights abuses; they also alter the local security calculus and can create dependence.  
- Space cooperation: Reports of Roscosmos‑linked satellite collaboration would, if verified, provide AES states with enhanced ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance) and communications capabilities. However, the source basis for these claims is contested and requires verification.

3.2 Turkey: security, training and commercial ties in Niger  
- Turkey’s July 2024 ministerial meetings with Niger covered security, defense, trade, energy and mining. By January 2025, Turkish military contractors and trainers were reported in Niger. Ankara’s Sahel engagement mirrors its broader Africa policy: combining military training, policing / security services, infrastructure contracts and trade ties. These arrangements are often contractual and can be more institutionalised than PMC models.

3.3 Iran, China and others: diversification toward contentious or sanctioned partners  
- Iran–Niger cooperation (signed at Iran Expo 2025) and growing economic linkages with China reflect AES strategies of diversification. Iran’s outreach may include trade and infrastructure; China’s involvement — though less visible in direct security provision — is likely to expand in mining, infrastructure and telecommunications.  
- Reports of engagement with North Korea and Afghan actors (potentially Taliban networks) raise acute sanctions and proliferation risks. North Korea is heavily sanctioned; any arms or military cooperation would be globally consequential.

4. Immediate and structural risks arising from the realignment

4.1 Security and governance risks  
- The use of PMCs (Wagner and others) can produce short‑term battlefield effects but engender long‑term legitimacy deficits, civilian harm and erosion of state monopoly on force. Such dynamics can sustain insurgency cycles and complicate reconciliation.  
- Rapidly negotiated security arrangements with little oversight increase the likelihood of human rights violations and constrain Western and multilateral engagement.

4.2 Non‑proliferation, safety and technical capacity risks  
- Nuclear cooperation with low‑capacity states raises legitimate concerns: construction and operation of nuclear facilities demand robust regulatory frameworks, independent oversight, safety culture, and international safeguards (IAEA). Without clear, credible IAEA engagement and substantial capacity building, such projects risk safety lapses and international apprehension. Financing terms, fuel supply arrangements and decommissioning liabilities must also be transparent to prevent long‑term dependencies or strategic leverage.

4.3 Sanctions, legal and financial exposure  
- Deepening ties with sanctioned states or entities (North Korea, certain Iranian entities) expose AES states and their partners to secondary sanctions and restrictions on finance, imports and banking — which could further constrict development options.  
- Diplomatic ruptures (e.g., Mali and Niger’s severing ties with Ukraine, and AES calls for UN action against Ukraine over alleged support for rebels) create unusual diplomatic flashpoints and may provoke aid reductions (Sweden cut aid and reduced engagement with Mali), compounding humanitarian strains.

4.4 Regional stability and multilateral responses  
- The realignment complicates ECOWAS and African Union efforts to manage coups and restore constitutional governance. Competing external patrons diminish the leverage of regional and Western actors and can fragment collective responses to insurgency and transnational crime.

5. Uncertainties and verification needs  
- Terms, financing, timelines and safeguards of the Russia–Burkina Faso and Russia–Mali nuclear agreements remain opaque. Independent texts and IAEA engagement records must be obtained.  
- The precise role, legal status and command lines of Wagner or other PMCs in AES states need systematic verification.  
- Claims of Roscosmos satellite cooperation are flagged by source concerns and require technical confirmation (satellite class, launch schedule, ground infrastructure).  
- The nature and extent of ties to North Korea and Afghan/Taliban actors — whether official, illicit or limited — needs clarifying to assess sanctions exposure.

6. What this realignment means for India — strategic implications

6.1 India’s interests in the Sahel and West Africa  
- Economic: expanding market access, mining and energy investments, infrastructure projects and supply‑chain diversification (critical minerals).  
- Security: counter‑terrorism cooperation, UN peacekeeping contributions and maritime security (Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic seaways affecting trade).  
- Normative and multilateral posture: India’s commitment to non‑proliferation, its engagement with the IAEA, and interest in a stable, rules‑based multilateral order.  
- Diaspora and development linkages: Indian firms, workers and aid programmes have interests in stability and predictable governance.

6.2 Constraints and opportunities created by the AES pivot  
- Constraints: AES alignment with Russia, Turkey and others may limit India’s access to certain contracts or complicate cooperation where partners have divergent strategies. Sanctions links (e.g., to North Korea) add legal risk to business and diplomatic engagement. Human rights concerns associated with PMCs complicate normative postures and could increase risk to Indian nationals or investments.  
- Opportunities: the AES’s search for new partners opens diplomatic space for India to offer alternative modes of engagement — particularly in capacity building, technical assistance, civilian energy solutions, training for security forces that emphasize rule of law, and multilateral development financing. India’s demonstrated competence in low‑cost infrastructure, power (including renewable energy and grid solutions), telemedicine, agricultural technology and workforce training can be influential.

6.3 Specific policy and operational implications for India  
- Non‑proliferation posture: India should reinforce IAEA‑led safeguards and conditional technical assistance for any nuclear cooperation, insisting on transparency, independent regulatory capacity and safety standards consistent with India’s norms and domestic strategic culture.  
- Counter‑terrorism and security cooperation: India can deepen intelligence sharing, training for counter‑terrorism units that emphasize human rights and community policing, and support for joint regional mechanisms (ECOWAS, AU). Directly contracting with PMCs is inadvisable given strategic and reputational risks.  
- Development and energy assistance: India should prioritise pragmatic, visible civilian projects (renewables, mini‑grids, electrification, water and sanitation) that address immediate needs and build goodwill without the capital and institutional burdens of major nuclear projects.  
- Diplomatic balancing: India’s strategic autonomy permits engagement with Russia and Turkey, but New Delhi must calibrate ties to avoid complicity in activities that contravene sanctions or international norms. India’s relationships with Russia (historic defence partner) and China (major economic actor) make nuanced diplomacy necessary.  
- Multilateral leverage: work through the IAEA, African Union, ECOWAS and UN bodies to promote transparency, safety and capacity building; use development financing (lines of credit, concessional projects) to present alternatives to opaque offers.

7. Recommended analytic and policy next steps for Indian decision‑makers

7.1 Information and verification  
- Acquire and analyse full texts (in original languages where necessary) of AES–Russia nuclear agreements; demand clarity on financing, fuel supply, liability and IAEA safeguards arrangements.  
- Monitor PMC deployments and incident data; coordinate open‑source intelligence with partners to map contractor roles and incidents affecting civilians and security of Indian interests.  
- Seek confirmation of Roscosmos satellite arrangements through technical liaison and multilateral channels.

7.2 Bilateral and multilateral engagement  
- Offer targeted, capacity‑building assistance: technical advisory teams for nuclear regulatory development only in coordination with the IAEA; renewable energy and grid projects to address immediate power deficits; telemedicine and agricultural technology to build resilience.  
- Expand diplomatic engagement with AES states at senior levels while simultaneously coordinating with ECOWAS, AU and UN to maintain normative pressure on governance and human rights.  
- Promote and fund training programmes for security forces focused on law enforcement, counter‑radicalisation and human rights, avoiding association with private military firms.

7.3 Legal, economic and risk management measures  
- Conduct legal risk assessments for Indian firms considering contracts in AES states, particularly where partners have ties to sanctioned entities; provide clear guidelines and export controls.  
- Use Indian concessional finance and private‑public partnership models to offer alternative investment packages with transparent terms.  
- Coordinate with like‑minded partners (EU, AU, UN) on humanitarian aid responses to mitigate the impact of Western aid reductions.

8. Research agenda and verification items (priority list)  
- Obtain and translate official nuclear cooperation agreements and Rosatom project proposals; request IAEA engagement records.  
- Systematically catalogue PMC presence, contracts and incident reports in AES states; commission independent human rights monitoring where possible.  
- Survey AES trade and financial flows for links to sanctioned entities; map risk contagion to Indian economic actors.  
- Track the implementation status (timelines, financing, contractors) of Turkish, Chinese and Iranian projects across Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.

Conclusion: strategic culture in practice — balancing autonomy, principles and pragmatism  
The AES realignment illustrates how states in fragile regions can exploit multipolar competition to secure immediate survival gains, while external partners leverage those openings to expand influence. For India, the episode is a microcosm of the strategic choices embedded in its strategic culture: the imperative to preserve autonomy and pragmatic ties; the need to uphold norms (non‑proliferation, human rights); and the operational requirement to protect and advance material interests. India’s response should be calibrated, multilevel and principled — offering viable civilian alternatives to opaque security and nuclear deals, insisting on multilateral safeguards where sensitive technologies are concerned, and using development diplomacy to undercut the appeal of transactional partnerships that compromise long‑term stability.

Actionable checklist for Indian policymakers (short)  
- Secure texts and technical annexes of AES–Russia nuclear agreements and query IAEA engagement.  
- Offer IAEA‑coordinated regulatory and safety assistance rather than ad hoc nuclear support.  
- Expand renewable energy and electrification projects in the Sahel as visible, high‑impact alternatives.  
- Strengthen counter‑terrorism intelligence cooperation and rule‑of‑law security training; avoid relationships with PMCs.  
- Issue clear commercial guidance to Indian firms on sanctions risk and reputational exposure.  
- Deepen multilateral diplomatic engagement through the AU, ECOWAS and UN to shape collective responses.

This episode in the Sahel will remain a live test of how middle powers like India reconcile strategic autonomy with responsibilities implicit in participation in a rules‑based international system. New Delhi’s choices will reveal whether its strategic culture prioritises short‑term expediency or long‑term stability grounded in multilateral norms.

## Case study: Leadership dynamics in the Alliance of Sahel States — evidence, ambiguities and implications for India’s strategic posture

Introduction

The Alliance of Sahel States (ASE) provides a salient contemporary example of how intergovernmental arrangements formed in crisis contexts complicate conventional categories of diplomacy, legitimacy and security cooperation. Formed by Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in the aftermath of successive military coups across the western Sahel, the Alliance combines an explicit security logic (mutual support, coordinated responses to internal and external pressure) with efforts by domestic military regimes to consolidate legitimacy. For readers of this book on India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the ASE case is instructive for three reasons: (a) it highlights how states governed by juntas create hybrid institutional arrangements that blur domestic and regional authority; (b) it shows how leadership turnover and title changes complicate partner identification and risk assessment; and (c) it demonstrates practical policy dilemmas for external democracies and rising powers (including India) when balancing principles with interests.

This section unpacks a representative data table that mixes Alliance-level and national leadership entries, explains its internal inconsistencies, and draws out direct implications and policy guidance relevant to Indian decision‑makers.

1. What the data shows: composition and key leadership entries

The table under consideration aggregates two layers of authority: the Alliance-level office (presidency of the ASE) and national executive/cabinet offices in the three member states. Key entries include:

- Alliance of Sahel States (Alliance presidency)
  - Assimi Goïta (Mali) — President of the Alliance of Sahel States: 6 July 2024 – 6 July 2025 (one‑year term recorded).

- Mali
  - Assimi Goïta — Interim President of Mali: 28 May 2021 – 3 July 2025 (listed as interim for much of the period).
  - Assimi Goïta — President of Mali (formal): 8 July 2025 – 8 July 2030 (a subsequent/formalized presidential term recorded beginning shortly after the interim period).
  - Prime Minister: Abdoulaye Maïga — from 21 November 2024 (incumbent at time of table).

Two structural features are immediately apparent. First, the table mixes regional institutional leadership (ASE presidency) with national executive offices and cabinet posts; second, many entries record transitions from junta or “interim” titles to formal presidential titles with overlapping or adjacent start/end dates.

2. Timeline inconsistencies and data‑quality caveats

Careful use of such a table requires attention to several technical inconsistencies that have analytical consequences:

- Small gaps and overlaps in dates: e.g., Assimi Goïta’s "Interim President" term ending 3 July 2025 and a "President" term beginning 8 July 2025 creates a five‑day gap. This could reflect an inauguration delay, a data entry error, or a legal/constitutional formality; analysts should not infer a substantive power vacuum without corroboration.

- Same‑day reclassification: Abdourahamane Tchiani is recorded as head of Niger’s junta until 26 March 2025 and simultaneously beginning a formal presidential term on 26 March 2025 — a pattern consistent with a junta leader converting military authority into a civilian/constitutional mantle. Such transitions may be performative (designed to seek recognition) rather than representing meaningful liberalization.

- Future‑dated multi‑year presidential terms: several entries (e.g., Tchiani 2025–2030; Goïta 2025–2030) record multi‑year presidential terms beginning in the future relative to the earlier dates in the table. These may reflect announced term lengths, constitutional adjustments, or projection/expectation rather than completed, internationally validated mandates. Treat them as claims by domestic authorities pending external confirmation.

- Inconsistent markers of incumbency: some rows use “—” (open‑ended) and others “Incumbent”; both indicate ongoing service but are formatted inconsistently. For comparative and automated analysis, normalize such markers to avoid misclassification.

Analytical practice: always triangulate coup-era leadership data with multiple primary sources (official communiqués, government gazettes), reputable regional press, and international organization statements (UN, AU, ECOWAS) before making policy inferences.

3. Political context: why these patterns appear

Three contextual dynamics explain why national and Alliance leadership appear intertwined and why title transitions occur:

- Mutual security and political solidarity among juntas: The ASE emerged as a defensive and diplomatic bloc of military‑led governments facing shared insurgencies, international pressure and economic sanctions. A formal Alliance presidency (apparently rotating or time‑limited) both institutionalizes coordination and signals a united front.

- Legitimating domestication: Junta leaders commonly seek to “normalize” rule by adopting civilian titles or announcing future constitutions and electoral timetables. Reclassifying a junta chief as “President” or creating a multi‑year term is a method of attempting de facto and de jure legitimization — domestically and abroad.

- Hybrid governance and technocratic PMs: Appointing prime ministers (often civilian technocrats) is a tactic to present a façade of civilian governance while retaining military control. Frequent PM turnover can indicate political balancing among military factions, reaction to international pressure, or managerial adjustments for governance challenges.

4. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

For Indian policymakers, the ASE example resonates across several policy vectors: regional security, energy and mining interests, diaspora and consular safety, global geopolitical competition, and India’s normative positioning. The following implications should inform India’s calibrated posture toward the Sahel and the ASE specifically.

4.1. Partner identification and diplomatic posture
- Distinguish de facto from de jure authorities: India’s diplomatic recognition and engagement should be guided by an assessment of who exercises actual control (de facto) while remaining mindful of international legal and normative constraints (de jure). The transition of junta heads to “formal” presidents complicates legal recognition; each case should be judged on concrete actions (restoration of civilian institutions, credible timelines for elections) rather than titles alone.
- Maintain principled pragmatism: India’s strategic culture emphasizes non‑interference and respect for sovereignty, but it also values stable external conditions for its nationals and projects. Pragmatic engagement (consular access, humanitarian assistance, technical cooperation) can be calibrated without full political endorsement.

4.2. Security cooperation and counterterrorism
- Counter‑terrorism convergence, but operational caution: All three ASE members confront jihadist insurgencies that threaten regional stability. India has limited direct military presence in the Sahel but can offer non‑combat security support (training, capacity building, intelligence sharing through multilateral channels) while avoiding force deployments that could complicate India’s non‑aligned posture.
- Monitor external security partnerships: The ASE states have deepening security ties with external actors (notably private military contractors and the Russian state via the Wagner model) that may recalibrate local threat environments. India should track these partnerships closely to assess risks to its nationals and projects.

4.3. Economic and resource considerations
- Resource security and economic opportunities: The Sahel contains strategic mineral resources (e.g., uranium, gold) and transit routes. India’s commercial diplomacy can pursue carefully structured engagements (transparent contracts, multilateral offers) that avoid legitimizing grossly undemocratic transitions.
- Sanctions and commercial risk: Frequent regime transitions and sanctions regimes (ECOWAS or UN measures) create legal and reputational risk for Indian firms. Diligent legal clearance, export controls and risk assessments must precede business activity.

4.4. Multilateralism and international norms
- Leverage multilateral platforms: India’s most effective levers in dealing with the Sahel remain multilateral — UN peace operations, AU mediation, and engagement with ECOWAS/UN bodies. Working through these fora allows India to advance stability‑promoting initiatives while aligning with international norms.
- Humanitarian and development diplomacy: India can expand soft‑power influence through technical assistance (agriculture, public health, governance training) and humanitarian aid — modalities that are politically acceptable even in sensitive transitions.

4.5. Contingency planning and consular preparedness
- Evacuation and citizen protection: Given the volatility illustrated by rapid leadership shifts, India should maintain robust contingency plans for evacuation, consular services and emergency communications for its nationals in Sahel capitals.
- Intelligence fusion and early‑warning: Prioritize fusion of open‑source monitoring (leadership lists, coup indicators), signals intelligence (where lawful), and partner intelligence to anticipate rapid changes that could affect Indian interests.

5. Policy recommendations for Indian decision‑makers

Operational recommendations informed by the ASE case:

- Institutionalize a Sahel watch unit: Within the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) or National Security Council Secretariat, create a small desk focused on Sahel dynamics, tracking leadership changes, external security contractors, and sanctions regimes.

- Engage multilaterally and cautiously bilaterally: Prioritize AU/UN/ECOWAS channels for mediation and capacity building, while maintaining limited bilateral interactions aimed at humanitarian assistance, health and technical cooperation.

- Condition normalization on tangible benchmarks: If India contemplates upgrading diplomatic relations or undertaking major economic deals, condition such steps on specific, verifiable benchmarks (e.g., timelines for elections, restoration of legal norms, protection of minorities).

- Offer technical–non‑lethal security assistance: Provide training in border management, counter‑IED disposal expertise, disaster relief logistics and judicial reforms rather than direct military hardware which could be politicized or used internally.

- Coordinate with democratic partners: Work with EU, USA, African partners and like‑minded states to harmonize policies on sanctions, humanitarian access and capacity building, while avoiding a zero‑sum framing that pushes Sahel regimes toward adversaries.

6. Methodological note for analysts

When using leadership tables like the one discussed:

- Separate levels of authority: Distinguish clearly between regional institutional offices (ASE presidency) and national executive roles; analyze each stream separately before assessing their interaction.

- Validate “claims” of legitimacy: Treat future‑dated terms and reclassifications (junta → president) as claims requiring independent validation via legal instruments, electoral timetables, and international recognition.

- Track ministerial turnover as a signal: Frequent changes in prime ministers and ministers can flag internal fragmentations or attempts to placate international critics; treat cabinet churn as a high‑signal indicator.

- Normalize data formats: For modelling or automated tracking, convert inconsistent incumbency markers and date gaps into standardized fields (de facto start/end, de jure start/end, source reliability).

Conclusion

The Alliance of Sahel States illustrates how regional institutions founded by non‑democratic actors can complicate the task of external policy formulation. For India, the key lessons are methodological (verify, triangulate, disaggregate institutional layers) and normative-operational (balance principled positions with pragmatic measures to protect nationals, advance development goals, and mitigate security threats). India’s strategic culture — anchored in respect for sovereignty and a preference for incrementalism — equips it to pursue a cautious, multilateral and capacity‑focused engagement in the Sahel. At the same time, the ASE case underscores the need for more active institutional monitoring, risk management and coordination with partners to safeguard India’s interests in an environment of fluid legitimacy and contested authority.
