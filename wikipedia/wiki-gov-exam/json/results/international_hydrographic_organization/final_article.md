### The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)

Overview  
The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO; French: Organisation Hydrographique Internationale) is the principal intergovernmental organization dedicated to hydrography — the science and practice of surveying and charting seas, oceans and navigable inland waters. As of May 2025 the IHO comprises 102 member states; membership is limited to sovereign states (not to organizations or individuals). The organization’s principal seat (headquarters) is in Monaco.

Mandate and primary aim  
The IHO’s central mission is to ensure that the world’s seas, oceans and navigable waters are properly surveyed and charted so as to promote the safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment. It does this by developing and promulgating international standards and technical specifications that enable consistent, interoperable hydrographic products and services across states and regions.

Mechanisms for delivering the mandate
- Standards and specifications: The IHO issues technical standards that underpin nautical charting and hydrographic data exchange. These standards are widely adopted by coastal states and referenced in international instruments.  
- Capacity-building programmes: Recognizing uneven global hydrographic capacity, the IHO runs capacity-building initiatives to assist developing coastal states in establishing or improving hydrographic services and charting capabilities.  
- Institutional structures and offices: The IHO operates through its Secretariat in Monaco and a network of technical bodies and regional hydrographic commissions that coordinate member-state activities and implementation of standards.

Key technical instruments
- S-57: The long-established transfer standard for electronic navigational charts (ENCs). S-57 has been central to traditional ENC production and exchange.  
- S-100: A modern, extensible geospatial data framework designed as the successor and broader environment to S-57. S-100 enables a wider range of maritime data types and improved interoperability for digital nautical products and services.

Relationship with the United Nations and normative authority  
The IHO holds observer status at the United Nations and is formally recognized within the UN system as the competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical charting. This recognition means that conventions, treaties and other international instruments addressing maritime issues normally defer to IHO standards and specifications when referring to hydrography and nautical charting. The observer role is primarily advisory and technical: it permits the IHO to input expertise into UN processes but does not, by itself, confer voting power within UN decision-making organs.

Links with other maritime bodies and stakeholders  
The IHO collaborates closely with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and a wide array of maritime stakeholders — from national hydrographic offices and navies to commercial chart producers and port authorities. Such cooperation is necessary to align technical standards with regulatory requirements (for example, carriage requirements for ENCs) and with operational needs of maritime navigation and safety.

Outputs and operational significance  
IHO outputs include: internationally accepted standards (S-57, S-100 and associated specifications), nautical charts and catalogue information (produced primarily by member states), and hydrographic publications and technical guidance. These outputs underpin safe navigation, maritime commerce, port operations, and marine spatial planning by ensuring that hydrographic information is accurate, consistent and exchangeable across jurisdictions and platforms.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy (brief assessment)  
For coastal and maritime powers such as India, the IHO’s work has direct strategic salience. Reliable hydrographic data and interoperable charting standards are foundational for safe commercial shipping, naval operations, amphibious and littoral manoeuvres, and coastal infrastructure development. IHO capacity-building in the Indian Ocean region affects regional partners’ ability to produce usable charts, which in turn influences collective maritime safety, freedom of navigation, and operational planning. India engages with and implements IHO standards through its national hydrographic service, and benefits strategically from the normative authority and technical harmonization the IHO provides across the maritime domain.

## History and formation of the International Hydrographic Organization

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is a paradigmatic example of how technical, safety-driven cooperation among maritime states can evolve into a durable international organization with strategic significance. Its origins, structure and evolution reflect both the operational necessities of safe navigation and the diplomatic processes by which states institutionalize technical harmonization.

### From national offices to an international need (19th century–early 20th century)
During the nineteenth century most maritime powers established national hydrographic offices. These agencies—tasked with surveying coastal waters, producing nautical charts and publications (sailing directions, tide tables, etc.), and advising navies and merchant fleets—emerged to reduce navigational risk and enable commercial and military maritime activity. However, national practices differed substantially: surveying methods, chart symbology, datum and projection choices, and the content and format of navigational publications were not standardized. For increasingly international shipping, these differences carried practical hazards.

Concerns about divergent hydrographic practice surfaced repeatedly at international fora. The 1889 International Maritime Conference in Washington, D.C., proposed a "permanent international commission" to address such differences. Similar proposals reappeared at subsequent gatherings, including the International Congress of Navigation (Saint Petersburg, 1908) and the International Maritime Conference (Saint Petersburg, 1912). These early initiatives laid a conceptual groundwork but did not produce an enduring body.

### The 1919 Conference and founding objectives
The immediate catalyst for institutional creation came after World War I. In 1919 hydrographers from Great Britain and France took the initiative to convene an international conference of hydrographers to harmonize practices and promote rapid exchange of information. London was chosen as the venue; the First International Conference of Hydrographers opened on 24 July 1919 with delegates from twenty-four nations.

The 1919 conference articulated a concise set of operational objectives that remain at the core of the IHO’s mandate:
- promote uniform methods for the preparation of nautical charts and hydrographic publications;
- make hydrographic results readily usable by mariners across national boundaries;
- institute prompt mutual exchange of hydrographic information among states;
- provide a forum for ongoing expert consultation.

The conference resolved to create a permanent technical organization and drafted provisional statutes to govern its work.

### Establishment, seat and early leadership (1921)
The permanent body conceived in 1919 began activity in 1921 as the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), initially with eighteen member nations. Prince Albert I of Monaco offered accommodation for the Bureau, and the Principality of Monaco was selected as the seat—an arrangement that combined Monaco’s maritime patronage and a geographically neutral, compact headquarters. In June 1921 the organization’s formal establishment was recorded and Vice‑Admiral Sir John Parry of the United Kingdom served as the first President.

### Organizational evolution and the name “IHO” (1970–2016)
Over the twentieth century the Bureau’s technical remit expanded as hydrography became more sophisticated and as maritime traffic grew. In 1970, under the leadership of hydrographic offices such as France’s (then headed by Guy Chatel), the organization adopted the current name, International Hydrographic Organization, through a new international convention agreed by member states. Despite the name change, the label "International Hydrographic Bureau" continued in common use to describe the organization’s professional secretariat until a major revision of the Convention took effect on 8 November 2016.

After the 2016 revision the permanent office was formally redesignated the IHO Secretariat. It is led by an elected Secretary‑General, supported by two Directors and a small professional staff—18 personnel were reported in 2020—based at headquarters in Monaco. Much of the IHO’s substantive technical work, however, is carried out through expert committees, working groups and regional hydrographic commissions composed of delegates from member states.

### Functions, standards and global role
From its inception the IHO has been an organization focused on technical standardization rather than political governance. Its core contemporary functions include:
- developing and maintaining international hydrographic and charting standards (for example, S-57, the long-standing standard for electronic navigational chart data, and S-100, a modern, extensible framework for digital nautical data and marine information);
- promoting prompt international exchange of hydrographic data and charts to support safe navigation;
- coordinating capacity‑building and technical assistance to developing hydrographic offices;
- facilitating cooperation on marine spatial data, oceanographic observations and survey priorities that affect shipping safety and environmental protection.

The IHO collaborates closely with other international bodies—most notably the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC/UNESCO), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)—to align standards, improve interoperability and integrate hydrographic data into broader maritime governance and ocean science frameworks.

Membership has expanded well beyond the original eighteen nations to include the great majority of maritime states, reflecting the globalized nature of shipping, fisheries and maritime security. While the Secretariat is small, the IHO’s influence is multiplied through its technical committees, regional commissions and the professional work of national hydrographic offices.

### Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For a maritime‑facing state such as India, the IHO is not merely a technical clearinghouse but a component of strategic infrastructure:

- Standardized charts and interoperable digital nautical data (S‑57 and increasingly S‑100) underpin safe transit of merchant and naval vessels in India’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and on international sea lanes of communication (SLOCs).
- Participation in IHO committees and regional hydrographic commissions enables India to influence regional survey priorities, charting standards and data exchange protocols—matters with direct operational import for the Indian Navy, Coast Guard and port authorities.
- IHO capacity‑building programs and technical cooperation assist national efforts to modernize hydrographic capabilities, conduct seabed surveys for navigational safety and support maritime domain awareness systems.
- Collaboration between the IHO and organizations such as the IMO and IOC strengthens the civil–military integration of maritime safety, environmental protection and oceanographic knowledge that are central to India’s maritime strategy.

In sum, the IHO’s history—from a 1919 London conference to a modern, standards‑setting organization headquartered in Monaco—illustrates how technical harmonization among states produces durable institutions that both mitigate risk and become enablers of national strategy. For India, engagement with the IHO is thus a practical necessity and a strategic asset in managing the maritime commons.

### The International Hydrographic Organization: Secretariat, Governance and Technical Resourcing

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is the primary intergovernmental body responsible for setting global hydrographic and charting standards. Understanding its internal governance and the way technical work is sourced is important for states—such as India—whose maritime strategy, maritime safety responsibilities and blue‑economy ambitions depend on reliable hydrographic information.

1. Secretariat leadership: reform and structure
- Until 2016 the IHO secretariat was led by a Directing Committee composed of a President and two Directors. This collegiate leadership model reflected an older governance arrangement in which executive responsibilities were shared among several senior officers.
- Revisions to the IHO Convention that entered into force on 8 November 2016 modernized that arrangement. The reform replaced the Directing Committee model with a single Secretary‑General supported by two Directors. The stated objective of this change was to clarify executive authority, improve accountability and streamline the secretariat’s management.
- Australia’s Robert Ward served as the first Secretary‑General under the new arrangement. The Secretary‑General now functions as the single head of the secretariat, while the two Directors provide senior support in technical and administrative domains.

2. Election, legitimacy and the Assembly
- All three senior secretariat positions—the Secretary‑General and the two Directors—are elected by Member States at the IHO Assembly. (The Assembly was previously known in practice as the IHO Conference.) The Assembly is the Organization’s principal decision‑making body: it adopts policy, approves budgets and conducts senior appointments.
- This electoral mechanism emphasizes Member State control over the secretariat’s leadership and aligns executive legitimacy directly with the collective will of members.

3. Secretariat staff and sources of technical expertise
- The permanent secretariat workforce comprises administrators, support personnel and a limited cadre of technical specialists. However, most of the IHO’s detailed technical and specialist expertise is contributed by personnel seconded or funded by Member States rather than by a large centralized professional staff.
- In addition to national contributions, the IHO draws on invited industry experts for specific tasks, standards development or technical reviews. These public–private interactions permit technology transfer, industry feedback and practical verification of standards used in charting and electronic navigation.
- Technical work is primarily channelled through the IHO’s committees, sub‑committees and working groups. Member States nominate experts to these bodies, which develop standards, guidance and technical products for adoption by the Assembly.

4. Oversight between Assemblies: the Council
- To ensure continuity of work between Assemblies, a Council composed of a subset of Member States meets typically on an annual basis to oversee implementation of IHO programmes, review budgets and provide executive guidance. The Council therefore acts as an executive/oversight body that monitors progress, resolves urgent issues and prepares matters for Assembly consideration.

5. Governance implications and operational consequences
- The 2016 Convention revisions can be read as governance modernization: concentrating responsibility in a single Secretary‑General clarifies lines of accountability and can make secretariat operations more nimble. At the same time, reliance on Member States for most technical inputs means that the IHO’s substantive output depends heavily on national capacity and willingness to contribute expertise.
- The practice of inviting industry specialists signals an acceptance of public–private collaboration in technical standard‑setting, reflecting the technical complexity of modern hydrography and navigation systems (e.g., electronic charts, digital data standards).
- The IHO secretariat is headquartered in Monaco; further, detailed descriptions of IHO organs, rules and current membership activities are published on the Organization’s website (www.iho.int).

6. Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For a maritime state such as India, engagement with the IHO has direct strategic and operational value. Participation in the Assembly, Council and technical working groups enables India to influence standards for charting, electronic navigational systems and data interoperability—areas that bear on maritime safety, naval operations and maritime domain awareness.
- India’s contributions of technical personnel (through its national hydrographic authority) and collaboration with industry partners both strengthen national capacity and shape international norms in ways consonant with India’s strategic interests: secure sea lines of communication, safe navigation in Indian and neighbouring waters, and data standards supporting the blue economy.
- The IHO’s governance model—Member‑state control of senior appointments, reliance on national expertise and annual oversight through the Council—means that India’s leverage within the Organization scales with the depth of its technical engagement and diplomatic involvement.

Conclusion
The post‑2016 IHO governance architecture concentrates executive responsibility in a Secretary‑General supported by two Directors elected by the Assembly, while substantive technical work remains overwhelmingly member‑driven and technically supported by invited industry specialists. For India, thoughtful participation in this governance and technical ecosystem is both a practical necessity for maritime safety and an instrument of strategic influence in international maritime standard‑setting.

## The International Hydrographic Organization: Standardizing Hydrography and Charting — Mechanisms and Strategic Significance for India

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) occupies a specific but vital niche in the architecture of global maritime governance: it raises and standardizes the professional and technical capabilities that underpin safe navigation. For states like India, with extensive coastlines, significant maritime trade, and expanding naval responsibilities, the IHO’s instruments for capacity‑building are not merely technical matters — they are components of maritime safety, interoperability, and national security posture.

### IHO’s primary role: safety of navigation through harmonized capability
At its core the IHO seeks to ensure safety of maritime navigation by elevating the quality and consistency of hydrographic surveying and nautical charting across member states. Hydrography — the measurement and description of marine environments — provides the factual foundation for navigation, port operations, maritime boundary management, and aspects of maritime domain awareness. By standardizing how that foundation is measured, recorded and taught, the IHO reduces risk, facilitates international voyage planning, and enables interoperable maritime operations.

### Mechanisms of standardization: standards, partnerships, and syllabi
The IHO achieves harmonization through several mutually reinforcing mechanisms:

- Standards of Competence: The IHO publishes detailed Standards of Competence that set out the skills, knowledge levels and professional qualifications expected of personnel engaged in hydrographic surveying and nautical chart production. These standards define both technical competencies (e.g., sensor operation, data processing, quality assurance) and professional requirements (e.g., fitness for purpose, understanding of legal responsibilities).

- Formal partnerships: The IHO collaborates actively with subject‑matter international associations such as the International Federation of Surveyors (Fédération Internationale des Géomètres, FIG) and the International Cartographic Association (ICA). FIG contributes expertise on surveying professions and technical survey methodologies; ICA brings cartographic and map‑production standards and practices. These partnerships enrich the IHO’s standards with disciplinary depth and ensure they reflect best practice across allied fields.

- Educational syllabi and curricula: Translating standards into practice, the IHO produces recommended syllabi for higher education institutions and national training programmes teaching hydrography and nautical charting. These syllabi specify course content, learning outcomes and assessment approaches so that academic programmes and professional courses produce personnel aligned with the Standards of Competence.

### Oversight and quality assurance: the Advisory Board
To maintain credibility and consistency, the IHO employs an Advisory Board (comprised of technical experts, educators and member‑state representatives) to review and approve education and training programmes. The Advisory Board functions as a gatekeeper for quality assurance: it assesses whether national or institutional programmes meet IHO expectations, advises on curriculum development and recommends improvements. This oversight mechanism helps assure member states that certified courses are comparable and that certified practitioners meet internationally accepted professional benchmarks.

### Implementation tools and national adoption
Member states operationalize IHO standards through a variety of implementation tools and institutional arrangements:

- Accredited courses and certification frameworks that align national credentialing with IHO competency profiles.
- Regional training centres and capacity‑building partnerships that address resource asymmetries between developed and developing hydrographic services.
- Distance learning and blended education options that widen access to specialised training.
- Competency assessments and continuing professional development to maintain and update skills.

At the national level, hydrographic offices (and associated legal and budgetary frameworks) are responsible for adopting and resourcing these measures. Effective implementation may therefore require legislative support, capital investment in survey platforms and sensors, and sustained funding for training.

### Continuous updating: technology and standards evolution
Hydrography is technically dynamic. Advances such as multibeam echo‑sounders, autonomous surface vehicles, remotely operated sensors and global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) change both data collection and processing. The IHO’s standards and syllabi therefore require regular revision to incorporate new methods, instruments and data‑management practices. Continuous updating ensures that standards remain relevant to contemporary operational realities and that interoperability is preserved as technologies evolve.

### Strategic implications for India
For India, the IHO’s capacity‑building model has clear strategic dividends:

- Navigation safety and trade: Uniform, high‑quality hydrographic information supports commercial shipping safety and port efficiency across India’s littoral and archipelagic approaches, protecting trade lifelines that are central to economic security.

- Maritime domain awareness and naval operations: Interoperable charts and shared standards improve the Indian Navy’s ability to operate with partners, conduct combined exercises, and sustain situational awareness in shared sea spaces.

- Blue economy and coastal management: Standardized hydrographic data underpins coastal infrastructure projects, resource management and environmental protection — all elements of a comprehensive maritime strategy.

- Capacity building and regional influence: By investing in IHO‑aligned training — through national institutions, regional training centres or collaboration with the IHO’s programmes — India can raise the hydrographic capabilities of neighbouring states, enhancing regional safety and strengthening diplomatic ties consistent with its strategic interests.

- Technological modernization and resilience: Adoption of IHO standards accelerates the authoritative integration of modern survey technologies into India’s hydrographic services, improving resilience against navigational risks and enhancing rapid response to hazards (e.g., post‑tsunami resurveying, disaster relief).

### Conclusion
The IHO’s suite of instruments — Standards of Competence, collaborative partnerships with FIG and ICA, recommended syllabi, and an Advisory Board for oversight — forms a coherent system for professionalizing hydrography and charting worldwide. For India, engagement with these mechanisms is both a technical necessity and a strategic opportunity: by aligning national hydrographic practice with IHO norms, India strengthens maritime safety, enhances interoperability with partners, and advances key elements of its maritime security and strategic culture. Continuous investment in training, institutional implementation and technological updating will determine how fully these international standards translate into national and regional security benefits.

## The IHO’s Standards: Technical Evolution and Strategic Significance for India

Since the late 1960s the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) has been the principal locus for the continuous revision and international harmonization of hydrographic and charting standards. The organization’s iterative approach—publishing successive editions of survey and charting standards to reflect changing technologies and maritime practice—has important technical and strategic consequences for coastal states, including India.

Historical and technical outline
- Evolution of survey standards. Beginning in the late 1960s the IHO began issuing successive editions of its Standards for Hydrographic Surveys to incorporate new survey technologies and to align accuracy requirements with the needs of commercial and naval shipping. The S-44 standard (Standards for Hydrographic Surveys) is the commonly referenced product; the notable 2008 edition of S-44 consolidated decades of change in sensors, positioning and survey methodologies.
- Paper-chart coordination and INT charts. To reduce duplication and to promote consistency, IHO members agreed in 1971 to an international charting series (INT charts). The agreement requires coordination among producers: if one state publishes a chart overlapping another’s coverage, any duplicate must employ the same underlying data as the original and conform to agreed numbering schemes and producer responsibilities. Publication M‑4 (1984) codified guidance, specifications and coordination procedures for INT chart schemes and producer obligations.
- The digital turn: ECDIS and ENCs. The rise of electronic navigation equipment in the 1980s and 1990s created a need to standardize the production, transfer and display of digital chart data. Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs) were developed as standardized, categorized databases of hydrographic information for safe navigation. The IHO standardized both the transfer formats—historically S‑57 (IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data), with S‑101 as the replacement product specification—and the ECDIS display rules (S‑52), ensuring interoperability between publishers, ECDIS manufacturers and mariners.
- Interoperability and legal drivers. IMO carriage requirements for ECDIS and ENCs accelerated adoption of IHO standards by making compliance a de facto trading and safety requirement for ship operators. The IHO’s work standardizing transfer protocols, data schemas and display guidelines therefore has direct regulatory and operational effects on maritime navigation.

Why these standards matter strategically (with an emphasis on India)
- Uniformity and safety at sea. Standardized survey methods (S‑44), chart symbology and presentation (M‑4/INT charts; S‑52) and digital data formats (S‑57/S‑101) create predictable, interoperable navigation products. For India—whose maritime commerce, offshore energy activities and naval operations depend on reliable charts—this predictability is foundational to maritime safety and operational planning.
- Efficient coordination and reduced duplication. The INT chart scheme and the M‑4 coordination rules reduce redundant charting effort in shared or adjacent waters. For India this matters in congested regional sea lanes of the northern Indian Ocean, and in cooperative charting arrangements with neighbours and partner navies.
- Enabling naval and maritime-domain operations. High-quality, standardized hydrographic data underpins naval navigation, amphibious operations, mine-countermeasure work, submarine operations and coastal security. Digital ENCs and ECDIS integration increase the speed and fidelity of navigation planning and real‑time maneuvering—capabilities that are strategically salient for India’s blue‑water aspirations and littoral security responsibilities.
- Economic and resource implications. Accurate charts are prerequisites for safe access to ports, for undersea cable and pipeline routing, and for hydrocarbon and seabed-resource exploration within an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Standardization reduces commercial risk and supports national economic security.
- International interoperability and diplomatic leverage. Participation in IHO standardization processes and adherence to INT charting conventions strengthen India’s ability to coordinate with partner hydrographic offices, to provide charting assistance in the region, and to shape regional norms—important facets of maritime diplomacy and capacity-building in the Indian Ocean region.
- New vulnerabilities and the need for resilience. Digitalization brings efficiency but also new risks—dependency on ENC datasets, cyber‑security vulnerabilities in ECDIS implementations, and supply-chain issues for digital chart distribution. These factors require that strategic planners treat hydrographic standardization not only as a technical necessity but as an element of national resilience and defence planning.

Contemporary developments and policy implications
- Migration to S‑101 and modern ENC governance. The IHO’s transition from S‑57 to S‑101 is a paradigm shift in ENC product specification that expands data richness and supports new display and environmental layers. India’s hydrographic authorities (and naval stakeholders) must plan for migration, training and system compatibility to retain full operational utility.
- Coverage and updating. The IHO continues to prioritize ENC coverage and timely updating of charts. For India, ensuring comprehensive and up‑to‑date ENC coverage of coastal waters, approaches to major ports and offshore resource areas is a matter of both safety and sovereignty.
- Harmonizing rules and national implementation. International standards require national implementation mechanisms—production capacity, quality assurance, distribution systems and legal/regulatory frameworks (including carriage requirements and cyber‑security standards). Strategic policy must thus integrate hydrographic capability-building into broader maritime security planning.

Key takeaways
- The IHO’s continuous updating of standards (notably S‑44 for surveys, M‑4/INT for chart coordination, S‑52 for ECDIS display and the S‑57→S‑101 evolution for ENC content) has been driven by technology and the operational demands of shipping and naval operations.
- Standardization reduces duplication, improves interoperability and materially enhances maritime safety and operational effectiveness—outcomes of direct relevance to India’s maritime commerce, navy and coastal-state responsibilities.
- For India’s strategic planners, hydrographic standardization is not a narrow technical matter: it intersects with economic security (ports, resources), defence readiness (navigation, MCM, littoral operations), diplomacy (regional charting cooperation) and resilience (digital dependency and cyber risk). Policy must therefore treat hydrography and IHO engagement as integral elements of national maritime strategy.

## International Cooperation: The IHO’s Regional Architecture and Partnerships

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) pursues its mandate—safer navigation, uniform charting, and improved knowledge of the seafloor—through a deliberately decentralized, regionally focused architecture and targeted partnerships. For a state such as India, whose strategic culture increasingly prizes maritime awareness, resource management and disaster resilience, the IHO’s model of regional coordination and scientific collaboration has direct policy salience.

### Regional Hydrographic Commissions: decentralised coordination and peer fora
- The IHO promotes the creation and maintenance of Regional Hydrographic Commissions (RHCs). These bodies gather neighbouring coastal states to coordinate national hydrographic surveying, charting and related activities within defined geographic regions.
- RHCs function both as technical coordinating mechanisms and as political‑technical fora. They encourage standardisation (conforming national practices to IHO standards and S‑100 data models), enable data sharing, and provide a mechanism to address cross‑border hydrographic problems—ranging from charting continuous approaches to ports to agreeing on soundings and bathymetric data exchange for contiguous coasts.
- Practically, RHCs also become vehicles for targeted capacity‑building: member states with limited hydrographic resources can receive training, technical assistance and access to shared datasets from better‑equipped neighbours. This reduces regional capability gaps and raises the overall quality of charts and navigation products.
- Of particular note is the IHO Hydrographic Commission on Antarctica, treated as a distinct entity because Antarctic hydrography presents unique logistical, environmental and legal challenges (ice cover, remoteness, seasonality and the Antarctic Treaty System). Its separate status recognises the special governance and operational conditions of polar hydrography.

Strategic implications for India
- For India, participation in regional hydrographic structures advances maritime domain awareness and operational safety across the Indian Ocean littoral. Regional standardisation smooths interoperability for naval and coastguard operations, supports maritime search and rescue and contributes to a common technical basis for delimiting maritime boundaries or conducting joint hydrographic surveys.
- Capacity‑building channels available through RHCs align with India’s interest in projecting regional leadership through technical cooperation and training (e.g., assisting neighbouring states with hydrographic survey capabilities).

### Nearly global regional coverage and practical benefits
- The IHO’s network—15 RHCs plus the Antarctic commission—provides near‑global regional coverage for hydrographic coordination. This granular, regionally tailored coverage allows the IHO to address local sea‑bed features, tidal regimes and navigational complexities more effectively than a purely centralised approach would permit.
- Effective RHC coordination yields tangible benefits: improved safety of navigation, more reliable charts for commercial and naval shipping, better inputs for maritime spatial planning, and more defensible data streams for maritime boundary negotiations.

Strategic implications for India
- Improved regional charts and shared bathymetric data reduce operational risk for India’s commercial fleet, naval task groups and offshore energy operations. They also strengthen the evidentiary base for delimitation processes, seabed resource assessments and fisheries management—areas with both economic and security dimensions.

### IHO–IOC partnership and GEBCO: integrating hydrography and oceanography
- The IHO partners with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO on the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) programme. GEBCO is a long‑running, international effort to produce the most authoritative global bathymetric maps of the seafloor.
- This partnership exemplifies productive cross‑organization collaboration: the IHO contributes hydrographic standards and national charting expertise; IOC brings oceanographic science networks and its convening authority in marine research.

Why GEBCO matters
- GEBCO’s global seafloor maps are inputs for safe navigation, oceanographic research, undersea infrastructure planning (cables, pipelines), habitat and resource assessments, and modelling of ocean processes relevant to climate and extreme events.
- The availability of consistent global bathymetry also speeds and improves tsunami and storm‑surge models—critical for early warning and disaster mitigation.

Strategic implications for India
- India’s strategic and humanitarian responsibilities in the Indian Ocean rim—tsunami warning, disaster response, and maritime security—benefit directly from improved, openly accessible bathymetry. Accurate seafloor data enhance naval mine countermeasure planning, submarine operations, undersea surveillance and the siting of undersea infrastructure.
- Participation in GEBCO‑linked initiatives dovetails with India’s scientific diplomacy (sharing data, hosting training) and with national efforts to build indigenous capabilities in seabed mapping, marine geoscience and ocean modelling.

### Antarctic hydrography: special challenges and governance considerations
- Antarctic hydrography is distinguished by environmental severity (sea ice, icebergs), extreme remoteness, limited seasonal windows for survey work, and a governance regime framed by the Antarctic Treaty System. These factors justify separate treatment within the IHO’s structure.
- Surveying Antarctica requires international scientific cooperation, logistic support, and cognisance of treaty obligations that prioritise peaceful, scientific use.

Strategic implications for India
- India’s polar research programme and Antarctic stations make Antarctic hydrographic cooperation strategically relevant. Engagement advances scientific excellence, helps secure India’s place in polar governance discussions, and supports operational safety for its vessels and research platforms operating in the Southern Ocean.

### Regional coordination and crisis response: an operational imperative
- Timely regional coordination of hydrographic data can materially speed disaster response. Bathymetric and chart updates are vital for accurate tsunami modelling, search and rescue planning and for re‑opening ports after storms or seismic events.
- RHCs offer a framework for rapid information exchange among neighbouring states when disasters strike, enabling more effective regional warning systems and joint operational planning.

Strategic implications for India
- Given India’s central role in regional disaster diplomacy and the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System, the IHO’s regional mechanisms and the IOC partnership strengthen India’s ability to lead cooperative emergency responses, to contribute critical data to regional warning systems, and to frame maritime resilience as a component of national and regional security.

Conclusion
The IHO’s approach to international cooperation—regionalised commissions augmented by strategic scientific partnerships—creates a pragmatic architecture that converts technical standardisation and data sharing into tangible policy and security outcomes. For India, engagement with RHCs, participation in GEBCO‑related work, and collaboration on Antarctic hydrography are instruments of strategic utility: they enhance maritime domain awareness, underpin safety and operational planning, support disaster resilience, and provide avenues for technical diplomacy consistent with India’s evolving maritime strategy.

## Establishment of the Chart Specifications Committee and International Charts

Purpose and intent
- The proposed Chart Specifications Committee and complementary International Charts programme aim to coordinate and standardize hydrographic and charting activities at the international level. Their core objective is to ensure that nautical information—seabed geometry, hazards, navigational aids and associated metadata—is produced, maintained and disseminated according to common technical specifications so that mariners everywhere have reliable, interoperable products for safe navigation and state maritime planning.
- For a maritime state such as India, these institutional arrangements are not merely technical conveniences: they underpin maritime domain awareness (MDA), naval and coastguard operations, merchant fleet safety, port operations and the security of sea lines of communication (SLOCs). Standardized charts and timely safety information reduce operational friction, enable cooperative operations with partner navies, and support legal and economic claims and activities in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf.

1. Exploration of the seabed and the movements of the sea
- Scope: Hydrographic and oceanographic surveying encompasses bathymetry (depth measurement), seabed mapping (substratum and morphology), tidal and current measurement, sediment dynamics and other processes that change seabed and near-surface conditions. These data form the primary inputs for both traditional nautical charts and modern, multilayer digital products.
- Functional value: Accurate, current seabed and sea-movement data are essential for routeing, under-keel clearance, submarine operations, mine countermeasures, dredging and port planning, and for scientific understanding underlying boundary and resource claims.
- Strategic relevance for India: Sustained surveying enhances coastal defence planning, supports amphibious and anti-submarine operations, aids the safety of heavily trafficked approaches (e.g., to Mumbai and Chennai), and provides the evidence base for continental-shelf submissions under the Law of the Sea where seabed morphology matters. Investments in systematic surveying also strengthen India’s ability to contribute hydrographic data regionally (Indian Ocean), thereby enhancing influence and cooperative security.

2. Standardization of maritime measurements, hydrographic terminology, cartographic products and GIS
- Need for standards: Diverse national practices in units, symbols, metadata and data models generate incompatibilities that increase navigational risk and complicate integration into electronic navigation systems. Standardization ensures that data from different suppliers can be merged and interpreted uniformly by mariners, naval planners and automated systems.
- Key technical standards:
  - S-57: the legacy Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) data format long used for digital charting.
  - S-100: the modern, extensible IHO data model designed to support a family of interoperable geospatial products (including ENC evolution, bathymetric surfaces, marine weather overlay, and more). S-100 enables richer, multi-layer services and future-proof integration with GIS and ECDIS platforms.
- Practical outcomes: Agreed symbols, metadata, accuracy tolerances and exchange formats reduce ambiguity, facilitate automated updating, and allow seamless overlay of auxiliary datasets (e.g., traffic separation schemes, seabed habitat, or submarine cable routes).
- Implication for India: Adopting and interoperating on such standards increases the utility of India-produced charts in international waters and for foreign-flagged vessels visiting Indian ports. It also aids Indian naval interoperability in coalition operations and joint exercises.

3. High efficiency of rapid dissemination of information on safety at sea
- Elements: Rapid and reliable maritime safety information (MSI) comprises Notices to Mariners, NAVAREA warnings, GMDSS broadcasts (including Navtex), and updates to electronic charts (ENC updates, ECDIS notices). The goal is to ensure changes—temporary or permanent—reach mariners quickly to minimise risk.
- Modern dissemination: Digital delivery (real-time MSI, weekly ENC updates, and push services to ECDIS) complements legacy paper notices. Interoperability, authenticated updates and redundancy (multiple channels) are essential to sustain reliability during crises or electronic disruption.
- Operational significance: Timely MSI is decisive for hazard avoidance (e.g., new wrecks, shifting shoals), search-and-rescue coordination, and safety during naval or civilian operations. For navies, the ability to issue and receive authenticated chart updates affects tactical planning and force protection.
- Considerations for India: India’s maritime safety infrastructure—ports, coast guard and naval communication systems—must maintain modern MSI pathways, integrate digital update feeds into port services and ensure that regional partners can access and trust Indian broadcasts during cooperative operations or incidents.

4. Training of hydrographers and nautical cartographers
- Human capital requirement: Accurate surveying and quality charting depend on skilled hydrographers, surveyors, GIS specialists and nautical cartographers. Technical proficiency in survey platforms (multibeam echosounders, LIDAR, tide gauges), data processing, S-100/S-57 encoding and cartographic design is necessary.
- Capacity-building mechanisms: Regional IHO training centres, national hydrographic office courses, university programmes and on-the-job certification frameworks provide the pathways to competence. Competency standards and accreditation schemes ensure consistent professional outcomes.
- Regional cooperation: Shared training initiatives enable smaller states to build capacity and foster interoperability across a maritime region. India can both benefit from and contribute to such programmes in the Indian Ocean.
- Strategic angle for India: Investing in training expands domestic expertise, reduces reliance on external contractors, and creates a cadre of professionals capable of supporting naval operations, civil maritime infrastructure, and international assistance missions (e.g., surveying after natural disasters).

Additional institutional and technical context
- The IHO’s coordinating role: The International Hydrographic Organization normally provides the institutional platform for chart specification committees and for the INT (international) chart scheme. The IHO promulgates standards, hosts technical committees and encourages best practice among member states.
- INT charts: The INT scheme coordinates chart production to avoid duplication and ensure world coverage at agreed scales and specifications. INT charts—whether paper or Electronic Navigational Charts produced to INT specifications—are intended to be mutually compatible products for international shipping.
- Dissemination channels and interoperability: Modern systems include ECDIS updates, digital push/pull services, GMDSS/Navtex and Notices to Mariners; authentication and redundancy are critical to maritime resilience.
- Stakeholders: National hydrographic authorities, navies, coast guards, port authorities, merchant shipping, offshore operators, fishermen, marine scientists and international safety organisations all rely on standardized hydrographic information.

Implications for safety, trade and security
- Navigation safety: Consistent, up-to-date charts and efficient MSI materially reduce maritime accidents and environmental harm.
- Interoperability: Standardized datasets enable automated decision-making (ECDIS routing, autonomous systems) and coalition operations by removing technical barriers.
- Economic and strategic benefits: Reliable charting underpins shipping efficiency, port calls and offshore resource exploitation, thereby supporting economic security and the protection of sea lines of communication.
- Resource demands: Maintaining these capabilities requires sustained investment in survey fleets/assets, data infrastructure, standard adoption and continuous human resource development.

Recommendations (policy and operational)
- Adopt and migrate to S-100 and compatible standards: Plan a phased transition from legacy S-57 encodings to S-100-based products to support richer, interoperable digital services and ensure future-proofing of national chart services.
- Invest in regional training and capacity building: Expand national and regional training centres, offer scholarships and technical exchanges, and work through IHO mechanisms to raise the regional baseline of hydrographic competence in the Indian Ocean.
- Modernize maritime safety dissemination: Implement authenticated, redundant digital delivery channels for MSI (including push updates to ECDIS and secure NAVAREA broadcasts), and integrate MSI workflows with national MDA and port-management systems.
- Promote data sharing agreements: Negotiate bilateral and multilateral arrangements for survey data exchange and cooperative surveying in the region. Shared data reduces duplication, improves chart coverage and advances collective maritime safety.
- Resource and institutional sustainment: Allocate predictable funding for survey operations, data management platforms and continued professional development. Strengthen the capacity of the national hydrographic authority to act as a regional provider of expertise and products.

Conclusion — linking chart standardization to India’s strategic culture
- Standardized charting and coordinated hydrography are technical undertakings with strategic consequences. For India, robust hydrographic capability and active participation in international charting frameworks increase maritime resilience, underpin naval and economic security, and project technical leadership in the Indian Ocean. The establishment of a Chart Specifications Committee and a well-managed International Charts programme thus advances not only navigational safety but also the broader imperatives of India’s strategic culture: self-reliance in maritime capabilities, cooperative regional engagement, and the protection of national maritime interests.

## IHO Publications, Standards and Geopolitical Constraints: Relevance for India’s Maritime Strategy

The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is the principal international body that develops technical and scientific standards for hydrography and nautical charting. For states with significant maritime interests—India foremost among them—the content and accessibility of IHO publications matter both technically (for safe navigation, hydrographic production and interoperability) and strategically (for maritime domain awareness, information sharing and cooperation). What follows summarizes the key IHO publications and standards, their contemporary evolution, and the geopolitical limits that sometimes impede publication — with focused commentary on the implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy.

### Public access and core IHO publications
- Most IHO publications — including standards, guidelines and associated documents — are available free of charge from the IHO website. Free access increases transparency, lowers barriers for developing hydrographic services and supports global maritime safety and interoperability.
- Examples of publicly available IHO outputs of particular interest to practitioners and policymakers:
  - International Hydrographic Review (technical and policy articles)
  - International Hydrographic Bulletin (news and developments)
  - Hydrographic Dictionary (standardised terminology)
  - Year Book (country-level hydrographic data and organisational information)
- The availability of these documents enables national hydrographic offices, navies, maritime administrations and commercial maritime operators to align operations with internationally agreed practices without cost barriers.

### Charting standards: S-57 and the S-100 family
- S-57: The IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data. S-57 is the long-established encoding standard used for Electronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). It remains the primary operational format for many existing ENC systems and chart production workflows.
- S-100: Introduced by the IHO in 2010, S-100 represents a contemporary, geospatially-oriented framework for modelling marine data and information. It is designed to be:
  - More flexible and modular than S-57
  - Able to accommodate a far broader range of marine datasets (bathymetry, marine protected areas, sea ice, real-time sensor feeds, etc.)
  - Supportive of new services beyond traditional navigation (e.g., situational awareness, route optimisation, environmental monitoring)
- Comparative note: S-57 is older and ENC-specific; S-100 is architected for diverse geospatial uses and for future-proofing hydrographic data exchange.

### The S-100 online registry and ISO alignment
- The IHO supports S-100 and its related product specifications through an online registry accessible on the IHO website. The registry provides authoritative versioning and machine‑readable metadata for each product specification, which is critical for interoperability and software implementation.
- S-100 is explicitly aligned with the ISO 19100 series of geographic information standards (the international family of standards for geospatial data). This alignment:
  - Makes S-100 compatible with mainstream GIS tooling and modern geospatial workflows
  - Lowers integration friction between hydrographic data and broader geospatial ecosystems used by civilian agencies and commercial providers
- Because S-100 is built on ISO 19100 concepts, it can be employed not only by hydrographic offices but also by non-hydrographic maritime data providers (private vendors, port authorities, oceanographic institutions), increasing the pool of actors who can produce and consume interoperable marine data.

### Adoption, e‑Navigation and the wider maritime information environment
- Government and private sector data providers are progressively adopting S-100 to support emerging maritime concepts — notably e‑Navigation, which has been endorsed by the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO). S-100’s modular approach makes it suitable for:
  - Enhanced voyage planning and electronic chart displays
  - Integrated situational awareness displays that combine charting, weather, traffic and sensor data
  - Automated services and machine-to-machine exchange required by modern maritime operations
- For India, an S-100-compatible environment would enable closer integration of naval hydrography, port and coastal authorities, commercial shipping stakeholders and coastal surveillance systems — improving maritime domain awareness and response effectiveness.

### S-23 (Limits of Oceans and Seas) and geopolitical constraints on publication
- S-23 (Limits of Oceans and Seas) is a key IHO publication that defines standardised names and limits for oceans and seas.
- Historical chronology: the 3rd edition dates to 1953. Work on a 4th edition began in 1986 and a draft has existed since 2002, but official publication of the 4th edition has been suspended.
- The suspension has been caused by an unresolved naming dispute between South Korea and Japan over the sea name appearing in the 1953 edition (commonly referred to as the “Japan Sea” vs “East Sea” dispute).
- This case illustrates a broader point: technical standardisation processes that touch on geographic names can be delayed or blocked by geopolitical disagreements. A purely technical product can become a vehicle for political contention.

### Strategic and policy implications for India
- Operational benefits: Free access to IHO standards and the shift to S-100 deliver operational advantages for India’s hydrographic community and maritime services by enabling:
  - Interoperable charts and data exchange with regional partners
  - Integration of hydrographic data into national geospatial systems used for coastal security, port management and disaster response
  - Adoption of advanced e‑Navigation services that improve safety and commercial efficiency
- Institutional preparedness: India’s National Hydrographic Office and associated agencies will need to plan for migration paths from S-57-based workflows to S-100-compatible production, including training, software procurement and metadata governance.
- Multi‑actor environment: Because S-100 permits contributions from non-hydrographic providers, India’s policy must consider regulatory frameworks for data quality, provenance and security as private and commercial actors join the marine-geospatial ecosystem.
- Geopolitical caution: The S-23 naming dispute is a reminder that international technical instruments can carry political content. India must balance technical engagement in international standardisation with diplomatic awareness — particularly where cartographic products intersect with disputed boundaries or names.
- Broader strategic fit: Investment in S-100 capabilities and active engagement with IHO processes align with India’s broader strategic culture that emphasizes maritime presence, interoperable cooperative mechanisms with regional partners, and the use of technical standards to enhance credible maritime governance.

### Concluding note
For a maritime power like India, the IHO’s publications and evolving standards are not merely technical artefacts; they are infrastructure for interoperability, safety, and cooperative maritime governance. The shift toward S-100, its ISO alignment and the open online registry expand opportunities for integrated maritime information systems and commercial innovation—but they also raise institutional and governance challenges. Finally, the S-23 case demonstrates that technical standardisation operates within a political context: mastering both the technical transition and the diplomatic landscape is necessary for India to realise the full strategic value of international hydrographic standards.
