## The South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone (ZPCAS / ZOPACAS): Origins, Purpose and Limits

Note: the primary source summary for this section draws on a publicly edited article that carried a maintenance tag (dated July 2017) requesting additional citations and urging readers to consult primary documents and scholarly sources (news, books, JSTOR, archival U.N. texts). Readers should consult the original U.N. resolution texts and the 1994 Brasília Declaration for definitive wording (recommended sources are listed at the end of this section).

Background and creation
- The South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone (commonly abbreviated ZPCAS or ZOPACAS; Spanish: Zona de Paz y Cooperación del Atlántico Sur; Portuguese: Zona de Paz e Cooperação do Atlântico Sul) was established by U.N. General Assembly resolution A/RES/41/11 in 1986. The initiative was launched by Brazil and framed as a regional political instrument to coordinate cooperation and preserve peace and security in the South Atlantic.
- The U.N. General Assembly resolution is a political measure. GA resolutions are important expressions of international consensus but are generally non‑binding under international law; the effectiveness of ZPCAS therefore depends principally on member states’ political will and on overlapping treaty arrangements.

Primary aims and instruments
- ZPCAS articulates three interlinked objectives:
  1. to promote political and economic cooperation among South Atlantic states;
  2. to maintain peace and security in the South Atlantic maritime region; and
  3. to prevent the geographical proliferation of nuclear weapons and to limit or remove the military presence of non‑regional powers.
- In practice these aims have been pursued through periodic ministerial meetings, declarations (notably the 1994 Brasília Denuclearization Declaration), and diplomatic outreach. A notable political act was the adoption by member states, in Brasília in September 1994, of a Declaration on Denuclearization for the South Atlantic.

Denuclearization: declaration versus legal zone
- The 1994 Brasília Declaration affirmed a political commitment by ZPCAS members to denuclearize the South Atlantic. The U.N. General Assembly subsequently endorsed the 1994 initiative — a reflection of regional support — but important naval powers (the United States, the United Kingdom and France) opposed that endorsement. Their opposition is best understood in light of strategic considerations (see below).
- It is important to distinguish declarations and political commitments from legally constituted nuclear‑weapon‑free zones (NWFZs). ZPCAS is not, as an entity, a formally established NWFZ under the NWFZ framework recognized by the IAEA and the U.N. Instead, many ZPCAS member states are party to established regional NWFZ treaties:
  - African states in the South Atlantic are parties to the African Nuclear‑Weapon‑Free Zone Treaty (Treaty of Pelindaba; entered into force in 2009).
  - Latin American and Caribbean states are parties to the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Tlatelolco Treaty; effective 1969).
- Because membership and geographical scope differ across these treaties, gaps in legal coverage remain. Some islands and territories in the South Atlantic (for example, certain Mid‑Atlantic Ridge islands, Saint Helena and its dependencies, and Norway’s Bouvet Island) are not covered by Pelindaba or Tlatelolco; this produces a mosaic rather than a continuous legal NWFZ across the entire South Atlantic. Conversely, the British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands are covered by the regional treaties.

Strategic context and objections
- ZPCAS emerged in the late Cold War era and reflected post‑colonial regional security anxieties: concerns about external military deployments in the South Atlantic, and the desire by littoral and adjacent states to limit superpower competition in an oceanic space linking South America, Africa and the wider Atlantic maritime commons.
- The South Atlantic’s strategic salience is multifaceted: it contains important commercial shipping lanes, rich fisheries, potential hydrocarbon and mineral resources, and a scattering of strategically positioned islands. These attributes underpin why external powers—especially those with naval reach and overseas territories—have historically resisted arrangements that could constrain their freedom of navigation or basing options.
- The opposition by the United States, United Kingdom and France to full endorsement of a regional denuclearization measure can be read as motivated by concerns about:
  - the legal and practical ramifications for naval operations and basing rights;
  - the status of overseas territories and their defense arrangements; and
  - broader implications for freedom of navigation and power projection in a strategically important oceanic region.

Practical limits and enforcement
- Denuclearization declarations within ZPCAS are primarily political and normative instruments. Their practical enforceability depends on (a) the legal reach of binding NWFZ treaties that individual states have ratified; (b) the disposition of metropolitan states that control overseas territories in the region; and (c) verification and compliance mechanisms (for which the Pelindaba and Tlatelolco frameworks provide concrete procedures within their respective zones).
- Disputed territories and islands under the administration of non‑member metropolitan states complicate comprehensive coverage; sovereignty questions and defense arrangements often determine whether a given location falls under a regional prohibition.

Relevance for India’s strategic outlook
- For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, ZPCAS is illustrative of several broader themes:
  - regional initiatives can seek to shape maritime security norms without creating comprehensive legal regimes; their success depends on regional cohesion and links to existing treaty regimes;
  - great‑power interests and overseas territories shape the feasibility of denuclearization and demilitarization proposals in oceanic spaces; and
  - India, as an extra‑regional but increasingly global maritime actor with interests in the South Atlantic (through diplomatic, commercial and resource links with African and South American states), watches such arrangements for precedent on normative constraint of military presence and on opportunities for cooperative security arrangements that may affect global commons governance.
- India’s own approach to maritime security zones, nuclear non‑proliferation and coalition building can be informed by the ZPCAS experience: regional declarations may advance norms, but durable regimes usually require legally binding instruments, verification measures and inclusive engagement with external powers whose basing and naval operations intersect the region.

Concluding assessment
- ZPCAS represents an important regional diplomatic attempt to manage security in a strategically significant oceanic space. Its normative achievements—particularly the 1994 denuclearization declaration—underscore the capacity of regional coalitions to articulate collective preferences. At the same time, the initiative’s limits—non‑binding origins, treaty coverage gaps, and resistance from external naval powers—illustrate the structural constraints that shape regional security governance in areas where great‑power interests and overseas territories overlap. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, ZPCAS is a useful comparator for how middle powers seek to craft maritime norms and the conditions under which such norms migrate from political declarations to enforceable legal regimes.

### The South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone (ZPCAS/ZOPACAS): Membership and Strategic Significance

Overview  
The South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone (ZPCAS, also known by its Portuguese/Spanish acronym ZOPACAS) is a regional arrangement established in 1986 to promote peace, cooperation and security across the South Atlantic littoral. The instrument was conceived to coordinate coastal and island states’ policies on maritime security, resource protection and to limit the placement of extra‑regional military forces in the basin. The document under consideration is a simple two‑column enumeration of ZPCAS members (Country | Continent) listing 24 states.

Membership (Country — Continent)  
| Country | Continent |
|---|---|
| Angola | Africa |
| Argentina | Americas |
| Benin | Africa |
| Brazil | Americas |
| Cameroon | Africa |
| Cape Verde | Africa (island state) |
| Congo | Africa |
| Democratic Republic of the Congo | Africa |
| Equatorial Guinea | Africa |
| Gabon | Africa |
| Gambia | Africa |
| Ghana | Africa |
| Guinea | Africa |
| Guinea‑Bissau | Africa |
| Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) | Africa |
| Liberia | Africa |
| Namibia | Africa |
| Nigeria | Africa |
| São Tomé and Príncipe | Africa (island state) |
| Senegal | Africa |
| Sierra Leone | Africa |
| South Africa | Africa |
| Togo | Africa |
| Uruguay | Americas |

Quantitative and Geographic Observations
- Total members: 24.  
- Continental distribution: 21 African states and 3 South American states (Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay).  
- Geographical logic: members principally comprise South Atlantic littoral states and proximate island states whose Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and maritime approaches define the basin’s security environment. Island members (notably Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe) are strategically important for surveillance, maritime domain awareness and EEZ management.

Founding context and core purposes
- Historical moment: ZPCAS was created in the mid‑1980s (formally launched in 1986). The initiative reflected regional concerns about militarisation, external power projection into the South Atlantic, and the need to coordinate policies among states separated by ocean but linked by maritime resources and security challenges.  
- Core aims (concise): promote regional peace and cooperation; strengthen maritime security and surveillance; protect marine and coastal resources; coordinate scientific and environmental cooperation; and resist extra‑regional military encroachment or permanent bases in the South Atlantic.

Operational emphases and programmatic areas
- Maritime surveillance and maritime domain awareness (MDA): harmonising patrols, improving coastal monitoring, and information‑sharing among littoral states.  
- Environmental protection and scientific cooperation: joint programs on fisheries management, pollution control and oceanographic research.  
- Resource protection: coordinating approaches to EEZ enforcement, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and offshore resource governance.  
- Non‑proliferation and demilitarisation norms: political commitments to prevent the introduction of foreign bases and to limit militarisation of the basin.

Political balance and diplomatic metrics
- The 21:3 ratio (African:South American members) is analytically useful: it demonstrates African ownership of the agenda and explains the primacy of African maritime priorities within ZPCAS. At the same time, the presence of three South American states—especially Brazil—gives the initiative cross‑continental legitimacy and a coordinating bridge across the ocean. Brazil has frequently acted as a diplomatic and operational leader within the Zone.

Institutional caveats and gaps for further study
- The simple membership list omits important variables for policy appraisal: the status and role of observer states, the Zone’s formal institutional mechanisms (secretariat arrangements, financing, decision procedures), frequency and level of ministerial/technical meetings, and concrete cooperative projects or joint exercises. These operational details determine whether ZPCAS functions as a normative forum or as a vehicle for sustained interoperability.

Relevance and implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although India is not a ZPCAS member, the institution is directly relevant to Indian strategic thinking for several reasons:
- Maritime commons and norms: ZPCAS exemplifies regional efforts to govern an ocean basin through cooperative norms (non‑militarisation, resource protection). India’s maritime doctrine and advocacy for global commons governance can learn from such regional architectures when engaging in the Indian Ocean and elsewhere.  
- Partnership potential with South Atlantic states: India has growing diplomatic, economic and defence links with several ZPCAS members (notably South Africa and Brazil, via IBSA and BRICS). These relationships create platforms for trilateral or multilateral cooperation on oceanography, anti‑piracy, IUU fishing and naval exercises that reinforce India’s profile as a maritime security actor.  
- Strategic signalling on extra‑regional presence: ZPCAS’s concern about extra‑regional military presence echoes India’s sensitivities about great‑power naval deployments in adjacent seas. Studying ZPCAS helps Indian policymakers assess regional resistance dynamics and the legitimacy of basing/over‑the‑horizon deployments.  
- Lessons for regional architecture: ZPCAS illustrates how geographically constrained coalitions can build normative constraints and low‑institutional cooperation. For Indian strategic culture—which balances non‑alignment tradition with pragmatic partnerships—ZPCAS offers a model of principled regionalism that can be adapted to Indian Ocean initiatives (e.g., maritime surveillance networks, capacity building for island states).

Concluding analytical points
- ZPCAS is a territorially coherent, African‑led initiative with selective South American partnerships; its power lies less in deep institutionalisation and more in normative consensus about the non‑militarisation and cooperative management of the South Atlantic.  
- For India, ZPCAS is instructive rather than prescriptive: it provides both policy lessons on basin governance and concrete diplomatic entry points through shared partners (Brazil, South Africa, Uruguay) for advancing India’s maritime security and scientific cooperation objectives.  
- Research agenda: to use ZPCAS as an analytic comparator, scholars and policymakers should examine its operational records (joint exercises, MDA projects), observer networks, and the mechanisms that have sustained—or limited—its effectiveness over time. These empirical details are crucial for applying ZPCAS lessons to Indian Ocean policy formulations.
