## The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS): a compact model of regional, issue‑based cooperation

Introduction  
The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) exemplifies a modern intergovernmental organisation created to manage cross‑border, transnational problems in a geographically bounded maritime region. Although the CBSS is a European, Baltic‑region body, its institutional design and programmatic priorities are analytically useful in an Indian context: it illustrates how small‑to‑medium regional organisations operationalise an integrated approach to identity, security and sustainability — priorities that increasingly shape contemporary national security strategies everywhere, including India.

Type and regional scope  
- Type: The CBSS is an intergovernmental organisation composed of sovereign states that cooperate formally on shared regional issues.  
- Regional scope: Its mandate is regional — centered on cooperation across the Baltic Sea area and neighbouring states — and therefore focused on problems that transcend national borders (maritime environment, people flows, cross‑border crime, social and cultural exchange).

Three complementary priorities (mandate architecture)  
The CBSS organises its work around three overarching and deliberately complementary priorities. Presenting them together is instructive for national security analysts because it demonstrates how social cohesion, civil security and sustainable development can be framed as mutually reinforcing objectives in a regional setting.

1. Regional identity  
- Focus: culture, education, youth engagement and other initiatives aimed at building a shared sense of belonging and cross‑border social capital.  
- Rationale: identity work reduces mistrust, supports people‑to‑people ties and creates a foundation for deeper cooperation in other domains (security, economy, environment). For states thinking about strategic culture, these soft components matter for long‑term stability.

2. Regional safety and security  
- Focus: civil security and human‑rights‑centred protection measures, including prevention and response to trafficking in human beings.  
- Rationale: the CBSS emphasises non‑military security challenges — human trafficking, child protection, cross‑border criminality — that require coordinated law‑enforcement, judicial and social responses across jurisdictions.

3. Regional sustainability and prosperity  
- Focus: sustainable development goals, environmental protection of the Baltic Sea, promotion of a sustainable maritime economy, and labour/economic well‑being.  
- Rationale: environmental degradation, unsustainable maritime practices and economic dislocation are sources of instability; treating sustainability as a security and prosperity concern reflects an integrated threat analysis.

Themes and programmatic breadth  
The organisation’s thematic portfolio — sustainable development; environment; sustainable maritime economy; education; labour; culture; youth engagement; civil security; children’s rights; trafficking in human beings — shows how a regional body operationalises its priorities through discrete, problem‑oriented themes. These themes reveal an emphasis on both preventive measures (education, labour, youth) and reactive capacity building (anti‑trafficking, child protection, civil security).

Operational approach and instruments  
- The CBSS translates priorities into practice through thematic policy work and practical projects rather than limiting itself to intergovernmental dialogue.  
- Typical instruments (inferred from its programme logic): working groups, time‑bound projects, expert networks, capacity‑building programmes, cross‑border pilot initiatives and partnerships with other regional and supranational bodies (e.g., EU institutions, specialised UN agencies).  
- This operational mix enables both policy coordination and concrete local/regional interventions.

Stakeholders and modes of engagement  
- The thematic diversity implies wide stakeholder reach: national governments and sectoral ministries; local and regional authorities; civil society organisations; youth groups and educational institutions; and international partners/donors.  
- Multi‑actor engagement is central: technical experts design projects, while local authorities and NGOs often implement and sustain them on the ground.

Comparative advantage and policy logic  
- The CBSS’s regional structure is particularly well‑suited to transnational problems that single states cannot resolve alone: marine pollution, human trafficking, labour migration and youth mobility.  
- By coupling soft identity measures with harder civil‑security and sustainability programmes, the CBSS leverages social capital to improve resilience and facilitate cooperative problem‑solving. For scholars of strategic culture, this demonstrates how non‑military instruments and institutions can shape regional security dynamics.

Governance and practical notes (important for researchers and practitioners)  
- Governance model (general): historically, the CBSS has combined a rotating political chairmanship with a permanent secretariat that coordinates programmatic work. This hybrid enables political leadership and institutional continuity.  
- Practical research steps: to understand current priorities and engagement opportunities, one should check the CBSS’s present chairmanship, secretariat location, membership composition and the latest strategy or action plans.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
- Comparative lesson: India’s maritime and regional security challenges in the Indian Ocean littoral have parallels with Baltic‑region dynamics — transboundary environmental risks, human trafficking, labour mobility and the need for people‑to‑people linkages.  
- Policy implication: the CBSS model underscores the value of integrating identity/cultural cooperation, civil security measures and sustainability into regional security architectures. For India, such integration can inform cooperation formats (multilateral forums, working groups, project co‑funding) and capacity‑building priorities with regional partners (e.g., Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean partnerships).

Suggested follow‑ups for deeper study  
- Verify membership and partnership lists and note any recent changes.  
- Review the CBSS’s latest strategic documents and action plans under each priority area.  
- Identify flagship projects (especially in anti‑trafficking and maritime sustainability) and assess their outputs and impacts.  
- Examine CBSS measures targeting youth and children’s rights as illustrative case studies for preventive, identity‑based security programming.  
- Map the CBSS’s partnerships with other regional or supranational bodies to understand institutional complementarities and limits.

Conclusion  
The CBSS provides a compact, operationally diverse example of how a regional intergovernmental organisation can pursue an integrated agenda linking identity, civil security and sustainability. For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, this model highlights the importance of blended instruments — cultural exchange, targeted capacity building and cooperative environmental governance — in managing transnational risks and building resilient regional orders.

### The Council of the Baltic Sea States: Membership Composition and Political Implications

Summary
- The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) is composed of 11 members: ten sovereign states plus the European Union (EU) as a separate, full member. The ten states are Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland (joined 1995), Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden. The inclusion of the EU alongside nation-states is a defining feature of the Council’s institutional character.

Membership list (as presented)
- Denmark  
- Estonia  
- Finland  
- Germany  
- Iceland (1995) — accession year noted  
- Latvia  
- Lithuania  
- Norway  
- Poland  
- Sweden  
- European Union (counted as the eleventh member)

Why this composition matters: geographic and functional clustering
- The membership brings together three geographical-conceptual clusters: the Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden), the three Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania) and central/Baltic littoral states (Germany, Poland). That mix shapes the CBSS’s mandate and working priorities: maritime and environmental protection of the Baltic Sea, regional economic and infrastructural cooperation, cross-border projects, and a shared security and political dialogue among geographically proximate democracies.
- The combination of small states (Baltic and Nordic) and larger regional actors (Germany, Poland, the EU) produces a calibrated institutional balance: projects often require technical cooperation and EU funding instruments, while political dialogue operates through state-to-state mechanisms.

The special role of the European Union as a member
- Counting the EU as a full member is consequential for both analysis and practice. As a polity with supranational competencies, the EU can bring policy instruments, regulatory frameworks and funding mechanisms (for example, cohesion funds, EU environmental directives, maritime policy tools) into CBSS initiatives. This augments the Council’s capacity to implement region-wide projects beyond pure intergovernmental coordination.
- For analytical clarity, observers must state whether member counts include the EU or treat it as a separate institutional actor; inconsistent counting leads to ambiguity in comparative studies of regional organisations.

Iceland’s accession: a non-littoral but regionally invested member
- Iceland’s accession in 1995, despite its absence from the Baltic Sea littoral, reflects the CBSS’s broader political objective of regional cooperation among northern European democracies. Iceland’s participation underscores how regional bodies sometimes trade strict geographic criteria for political, security and cooperative cohesion among like-minded states.

Notable omission — Russia
- Absent from the ten-state list above is Russia. Historically Russia was an original CBSS member; however, its status changed following the geopolitical rupture precipitated by the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Membership, participation or representation of Russia in many regional institutions evolved rapidly in 2022–2023, and this altered the Council’s political dynamics and practical reach.
- Because membership status may be sensitive to recent diplomatic decisions, any definitive statement about Russia’s current formal status should be verified against authoritative, up-to-date CBSS sources. Changes in Russia’s participation have material consequences for dialogue, environmental cooperation (where Russia’s littoral presence is substantial), and the political legitimacy of region-wide projects.

Analytical implications for security and policy (relevance for Indian readers)
- The CBSS illustrates how regional architectures combine state membership with supranational institutional actors to pursue agendas that are simultaneously environmental, economic and security-oriented. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the CBSS offers a compact case of: (a) how small-state coalitions and larger actors cooperate in a shared maritime space; (b) the functional leverage an organisation gains when the EU (or a similar supranational actor) participates as a member; and (c) how sudden geopolitical ruptures (e.g., suspension of a major littoral actor) reshape regional governance and threat perceptions.
- Lessons for Indian policy analysis include attention to membership composition when designing cooperative frameworks (who brings resources, who brings legitimacy, who brings veto power) and the importance of contingency planning for membership disruption.

Methodological and practical notes
- Counting logic: explicitly state whether the EU is being counted as a member when reporting totals. Some treatments count only nation-states; others include institutional members — clarity avoids confusion.
- Verification: consult the CBSS official website, recent ministerial communiqués or the Council’s rules of procedure for authoritative, time-stamped confirmation of membership and the EU’s voting/representational arrangements.
- If using the membership list for legal, funding or procedural analysis, confirm (a) the EU’s formal competencies within the CBSS framework, and (b) whether suspended members retain any technical or project-level involvements.

Recommendations
- Verify the presence/absence and exact status of Russia for the specific temporal context of your analysis using CBSS primary documents.  
- When reporting membership counts, explicitly state the counting convention (EU included or not).  
- If analysing legal/institutional implications, confirm whether the EU exercises voting or representational rights within CBSS bodies consistent with the Council’s rules of procedure.

Short concluding remark
- The CBSS’s membership composition—ten nation-states plus the EU—embodies a hybrid institutional form whose political utility and vulnerabilities are determined as much by geographic affinities as by supranational capacities and shifting geopolitical realities. For comparative students of regional security architectures, the Council is a useful, compact laboratory for studying how membership structure conditions policy outcomes.

## Russia’s Suspension and Withdrawal from the Council of the Baltic Sea States (March–May 2022)

Brief factual summary  
- Russia was suspended from the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) in March 2022 and recorded its withdrawal in May 2022. The entry therefore classifies Russia as a former member of the CBSS.

1. What the entry states (concise reading)  
- The entry names one actor (Russia) and records two sequential formal actions: suspension (March 2022) followed by withdrawal (May 2022).  
- Suspension temporarily removed Russia’s participatory rights; withdrawal signalled a definitive exit from the organisation’s membership roster.

2. Context and timing: why this happened then  
- The timing (March–May 2022) corresponds to the diplomatic cascade following Russia’s large‑scale military operation in Ukraine. Many regional and international organisations took restrictive measures against Russia in that period.  
- The CBSS, founded in the early 1990s to promote cooperation across the Baltic Sea region, had included Russia as a longstanding participant. Its removal therefore represented a marked reversal in the region’s post–Cold War multilateral architecture.

3. Practical and normative implications

Operational and programmatic effects  
- Cross‑border projects that required Russian participation (marine environment protection, search and rescue coordination, maritime safety, transport links, and projects affecting Kaliningrad) risk disruption, reconfiguration, or suspension.  
- Working groups and initiatives that had routine Russian involvement may need alternative arrangements, new partners, or termination.

Political and diplomatic consequences  
- The suspension and subsequent withdrawal underscored Russia’s increasing isolation from Northern and Eastern European multilateral forums.  
- It narrowed formal channels for regional dialogue, potentially reducing opportunities for confidence‑building and crisis prevention within the Baltic security environment.

Legal and administrative questions  
- Whether Russia remains liable for outstanding financial obligations or bound by prior commitments depends on CBSS rules and any transitional provisions adopted by members.  
- The precise legal effect of “suspension” versus “withdrawal” should be read against the CBSS statute and the wording of the decisions adopted in March–May 2022.

Security implications  
- The exit removed one institutional venue for discussing regional security issues involving Russia, creating a gap in institutionalised communication mechanisms.  
- This change may push some interactions into bilateral channels, NATO‑dominated forums, or ad hoc problem‑solving fora, with attendant risks to transparency and predictability.

4. Additional relevant background and patterning  
- The CBSS was part of a wider post‑Cold War architecture that sought to integrate Russia into cooperative regional governance; its diminished role marks a partial rollback of that integration.  
- Similar suspension/expulsion dynamics were visible across other bodies in 2022; mapping these measures together helps interpret the broader diplomatic posture of European states toward Russia.  
- Any eventual re‑engagement would require political will among remaining members and compliance with the CBSS’s procedural conditions for re‑admission.

5. Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy—analytical takeaways  
- Precedent for multilateral exclusion: The CBSS case illustrates how regional organisations can rapidly alter membership and access as instruments of collective political signalling. Indian strategists should note how membership rules can be mobilised for punitive diplomacy and how that affects issue‑specific cooperation.  
- Managing partnerships when partners are isolated: India’s long‑standing ties with Russia present dilemmas when Russia’s regional behaviour provokes multilateral censure. Newer patterns of exclusion in Europe demonstrate the diplomatic costs and operational frictions that flow from partner isolation—relevant for Indian contingency planning in defence procurements, energy diplomacy, and high‑level engagement.  
- Protecting issue‑based cooperation: The operational disruptions to environmental and maritime programmes in the Baltic show how security crises spill into functional domains. India’s policy makers should evaluate safeguards (legal, institutional, or diplomatic) to insulate critical technical cooperation from geopolitical ruptures.  
- Forum shopping and continuity of dialogue: With formal forums closing, actors shift to alternative venues. India’s strategic practice of pursuing multiple multilateral tracks (plurilaterals, minilaterals, bilateral channels) is a useful model for maintaining lines of communication and advancing core national interests when primary institutions are disrupted.

6. Sources to consult and recommended follow‑up research  
- CBSS official communiqués, meeting minutes, and press releases from March–May 2022 for the formal decisions and specific legal wording.  
- Statements and explanatory notes by CBSS member governments and by Russia to understand competing legal and political narratives.  
- Project inventories and working‑group rosters to identify programmes that explicitly involved Russia and trace how they were reconfigured.  
- Comparative analysis of other organisations’ responses to Russia in 2022 (to place the CBSS action in a broader pattern of multilateral measures).  
- Scholarly and policy literature on membership suspension/expulsion mechanisms in regional organisations to assess legal precedents and implications for re‑admission.

Concluding note  
The CBSS decision to suspend and then record Russia’s withdrawal is a compact episode with outsized implications for regional cooperation, institutional continuity, and the politics of exclusion. For Indian readers, it offers a concise case study in how multilateral bodies both reflect and shape strategic ruptures—and why resilient, diversified channels of engagement form an important element of national security policy.

### Observer States of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS): Roster, Meaning and Strategic Lessons for India

Short roster (factual)
- The CBSS currently lists 11 observer countries: Belarus (suspended in 2022), France, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Ukraine, United Kingdom, and the United States.
- The suspension of Belarus in 2022 is an explicit change of status: Belarus is named but not exercising observer privileges.

The institutional meaning of “observer”
- Observer status is a recognised category of participation in many regional organisations. It normally allows attendance at meetings, information exchange, participation in working groups and project cooperation, and sometimes limited technical input.
- Observers, however, do not receive full membership rights such as binding decision‑making power or voting in governing bodies. In the CBSS context this general pattern holds: observers are partners rather than principals.
- Practically, observer status is a flexible instrument for extending cooperation without extending formal governance authority — useful for knowledge sharing, funding partnerships and signalling political engagement.

Geopolitical composition and what it signals
- The observer list combines major transatlantic powers (United States, United Kingdom), western European states (France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain), several EU/NATO members from Central/Eastern Europe (Hungary, Romania, Slovakia), and two regional neighbours with contested positions (Ukraine and Belarus).
- This composition shows two features: (1) strong European and transatlantic interest in Baltic regional affairs beyond the immediate littoral states; (2) the CBSS’s role as a site for both regional governance (environment, cross‑border projects) and geopolitical signaling.
- Ukraine’s presence as an observer is politically meaningful: it signals European engagement and support. Belarus’s suspension in 2022 likewise signals diplomatic rupture and the organisation’s use of membership tools to register political norms or security concerns.
- The presence of the United States and the United Kingdom points to strategic interest in the Baltic not confined to geography: naval, security and alliance concerns animate extra‑regional involvement.

Functional areas shaped by observers
- Observer participation typically influences practical domains where outside expertise, funding or security cooperation are valuable:
  - Maritime safety and navigation, search and rescue coordination.
  - Environmental protection and remediation of the Baltic Sea.
  - Economic and infrastructural cross‑border projects, including transport and energy linkages.
  - Security cooperation and information exchange on hybrid threats (particularly salient given the region’s recent tensions).
- Observers may co‑sponsor projects, provide technical assistance or finance, and act as interlocutors linking the regional forum to wider multilateral frameworks.

Suspensions, additions and what changes reveal
- Alterations in observer status — suspensions, readmissions, new accessions — are not merely administrative. They are signalling devices:
  - Suspensions (as in Belarus, 2022) reflect serious diplomatic disagreement or security concerns and curtail a state’s ability to participate until relations are repaired.
  - Additions of observers reflect widening networks of interest and can indicate strategic outreach by the Council or by the newcomer.
- For analysts, tracking these changes is a useful indicator of broader regional diplomatic trends and security alignments.

Gaps in the roster information (research notes)
- The simple list omits useful contextual details that matter analytically:
  - Dates when each country became an observer.
  - Formal rights, limitations and modalities attached to each observer’s participation.
  - Evidence of active engagement (co‑sponsorship of projects, presence in working groups) versus nominal status.
  - Any bilateral or multilateral arrangements that condition observer activities (e.g., security cooperation agreements).

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Observations from the CBSS experience that are salient for India:
  1. Observer status as a calibrated instrument: For a rising power that values strategic autonomy, observer roles in regional organisations are a low‑cost, low‑commitment means to sustain influence, gather intelligence, and build coalitions without taking on formal governance obligations. India uses analogous arrangements (e.g., dialogue partnerships, summit invitations) in different regions.
  2. Signalling and normative posture: Invitations, suspensions and participatory choices serve as normative signals. India’s decisions to engage, abstain or suspend partnerships can convey policy stances without direct confrontation.
  3. Leveraging extra‑regional partnerships: The CBSS shows how extra‑regional powers (US, UK) use observer status to sustain presence. India can similarly deploy observer or dialogue partner roles (in IORA, BIMSTEC, ASEAN‑related mechanisms) to preserve strategic reach in the Indian Ocean and surrounding areas.
  4. Functional cooperation as gateway to influence: Practical projects (environment, maritime safety, infrastructure) create footholds for deeper strategic engagement. India’s expertise (maritime domain awareness, disaster relief, capacity building) is well suited to such pathways.
  5. Vulnerabilities and limits: Observer status lacks voting power; suspension risk ties status to political relations. India must balance the benefits of flexible engagement with the limits of constrained institutional influence.
  6. Monitoring status changes as strategic indicators: Just as observer list changes in the Baltic reveal shifts in regional alignments, India should systematically track accession/suspension dynamics in multilateral bodies relevant to the Indo‑Pacific as a source of early warning on diplomatic realignments.

Practical recommendations (policy takeaways)
- Treat observer/partner roles as part of a layered engagement strategy: combine technical cooperation projects with high‑level diplomatic signalling.
- Insist on clear terms of engagement when accepting observer roles (rights, expectations, project involvement) to avoid nominal participation.
- Use observer platforms to export India’s niche capabilities (coastal security, blue economy, humanitarian assistance), building reputational capital.
- Monitor other states’ status changes in regional organisations to gauge shifts in alignments and opportunities for selective intervention.

Concluding note
- The CBSS observer roster is more than a list: it is a compact case of how regional organisations knit together local and extra‑regional interests, use participation rules to reward or punish behaviour, and create practical avenues for cooperation. For Indian strategic planners, the lessons are concrete: calibrated institutional engagement, use of functional projects to translate presence into influence, and attention to status changes as diplomatic signals should feature in India’s toolkit for shaping regional orders.

### Directors General — Permanent International Secretariat, Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS), Stockholm (1998–2024)

Summary
- The source material lists the individuals who have served as Director General (DG) of the Permanent International Secretariat of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) in Stockholm, showing continuous leadership from 1998 through 2024. The excerpt also contains an orphaned heading, “CBSS Members and observers,” indicating broader organizational material not included here.

Chronological listing (consolidated)
| Director General | Tenure |
|---|---|
| Jacek Starosciak | 1998–2002 |
| Hannu Halinen | 2002–2005 |
| Gabriele Kötschau | 2005–2010 |
| Jan Lundin | 2010–2016 |
| Maira Mora | 2016–2020 |
| Grzegorz Marek Poznański | 2020–2024 |
| Gustav Lindström | 2024 – present |

Notes on the original source
- The raw input showed a duplicated entry for Gustav Lindström and a table artifact ("---|---"), indicating the content was copied from a table and lost some formatting. Consolidation and standardization of entries are necessary for clarity.

Role and institutional function of the Director General (contextualized)
- The Director General heads the CBSS Permanent International Secretariat in Stockholm. Typical responsibilities include daily administration, implementing policy decisions agreed by member states, representing the organization externally, and facilitating coordination among members and observers. The Secretariat is the operational backbone of the CBSS: leadership continuity there is central to institutional memory and policy implementation.

Observations from the leadership sequence
- Coverage is continuous from 1998 to 2024, with tenures ranging roughly from 3 to 6 years. This pattern suggests institutional preference for multi-year appointments that balance continuity with periodic renewal of leadership.
- The list alone omits selection procedures, biographical data, and specific initiatives tied to each DG. Such omissions limit interpretive value unless supplemented by contextual information (e.g., major CBSS initiatives, regional crises, or institutional reforms during each tenure).
- The “Members and observers” heading was left unresolved in the excerpt; a complete organizational chapter should explicitly list these constituencies.

Brief mapping of tenures to regional developments (illustrative)
- 1998–2002 (Starosciak): consolidation of post‑Cold War regional structures and preparatory period for the EU enlargement that affected Baltic regional dynamics.
- 2002–2005 (Halinen): period of EU accession for several Baltic states (2004) and shifting security alignments.
- 2005–2010 (Kötschau): emphasis on environmental and cross‑border cooperation; early attention to energy and maritime issues.
- 2010–2016 (Lundin): geopolitical shifts in Europe, including heightened security concerns after 2014; institutional responses to hybrid threats began to feature more prominently.
- 2016–2020 (Mora): migration challenges, cybersecurity and resilience entered regional agendas alongside sustainable development.
- 2020–2024 (Poznański): COVID‑19 pandemic effects on regional cooperation; the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine significantly changed the Baltic security environment.
- 2024– (Lindström): new leadership at a moment of heightened geopolitical competition — the agenda is likely to prioritize security, resilience, and regional coordination.

Implications and recommendations for an organizational chapter (and for comparative study)
- Enrich the leadership list with concise biographical notes and notable initiatives for each DG. This transforms a nominal list into a tool for analyzing institutional change and policy continuity.
- Include the full “CBSS Members and observers” list immediately following the leadership section to situate the Secretariat within its political constituency.
- Standardize presentation (Name — Role — Tenure — Key initiatives) and remove artefacts from copied tables to enhance readability and scholarly use.
- Where possible, map each DG’s tenure to concrete CBSS outputs, external events, and internal reforms to show causal or correlative relationships between leadership and institutional evolution.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy (analytical aside)
- For students of India’s strategic culture, the CBSS example illustrates how small-to-medium regional organizations rely heavily on a professional Secretariat and sustained leadership to maintain relevance across geopolitical shifts. Key lessons for India:
  - Institutional continuity in secretariats preserves policy memory and enables longer-term projects beyond electoral or government cycles.
  - Transparent selection and clearly defined tenures for executive heads can promote neutrality and credibility in regional fora.
  - Mapping leadership tenures onto policy outcomes helps assess whether institutional changes arise from leadership, external shocks, or both — a useful comparative methodology for examining India’s multilateral engagements (e.g., BIMSTEC, IORA, SCO).
  - In designing or reforming Indian-chaired institutions, attention to Secretariat capacity, leadership tenure, and the documentation linking leaders to initiatives can improve accountability and strategic impact.

Metadata (for editorial use)
- Document subject: Council of the Baltic Sea States
- Chapter: Council of the Baltic Sea States
- Section: Directors General of the CBSS Secretariat
- Time coverage: 1998–2024 (current DG since 2024)
- Source artifact: Table-like input with duplication and a missing follow-on section (“CBSS Members and observers”)

Suggested next steps for the book chapter
- Append short biographies (3–5 lines) for each DG and summarize 2–3 principal initiatives or institutional changes during their tenures.
- Insert the complete list of CBSS members and observers, and discuss how their composition conditions Secretariat priorities.
- If space permits, present a brief comparative table showing tenure lengths, selection mechanisms, and institutional mandates for secretariats in other regional organizations relevant to India’s strategic engagements.

## Case study: The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) — design, evolution and lessons for Indian regional strategy

This short case study examines the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS), a post–Cold War regional organisation, as an instructive example of how states design multilateral institutions to stabilise a fractious neighbourhood, manage functional cooperation, and preserve continuity through institutionalisation. Although geographically remote from South Asia, the CBSS offers concrete lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy—particularly on institution‑building, the role of secretariats, managing heterogenous membership, and the vulnerability of regional cooperation to broader geopolitical ruptures.

### Founding context and founders
- The CBSS was created in Copenhagen in March 1992 by the region’s foreign ministers. It was an explicit response to the geopolitical reordering that followed the end of the Cold War: newly independent Baltic states sought rapid integration with their Nordic and Central European neighbours, and established states sought a cooperative framework to stabilise the Baltic Sea region.
- Founding participants combined established Western European democracies, newly independent Baltic republics, and Russia, signaling a high‑level, inclusive approach to regional reintegration.
- Named founders (foreign ministers and senior officials) included:
  - Hans‑Dietrich Genscher — Germany
  - Uffe Ellemann‑Jensen — Denmark
  - Thorvald Stoltenberg — Norway
  - Lennart Meri — Estonia
  - Jānis Jurkāns — Latvia
  - Algirdas Saudargas — Lithuania
  - Henning Christophersen — European Commission / Denmark
  - Paavo Väyrynen — Finland
  - Andrei Kozyrev — Russia
  - Margaretha af Ugglas — Sweden
  - Krzysztof Skubiszewski — Poland

Key dates
- March 1992 — CBSS founded in Copenhagen.
- 1998 — Permanent international Secretariat established (Stockholm).
- 3 March 2022 — 11 CBSS members declared the immediate suspension of Russia from CBSS activities; Belarus (an observer) was also suspended.

### Institutional design and governance
- Highest decision‑making body: Conference of Foreign Ministers (meets annually). This design locates political direction at the ministerial level while allowing day‑to‑day affairs to be delegated.
- Supporting bodies: Committee of Senior Officials (CSO), thematic expert groups, and a permanent Secretariat. This combination enables political steering alongside technical, project‑level work.
- Chairmanship rotates annually among member states; the chair sets short‑term priorities and hosts the ministerial meeting—an arrangement that balances ownership and prevents long‑term domination by any single state.
- Membership traditionally comprises the Baltic littoral states (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden) plus the European Commission as an institutional member. Observer participation (e.g., Belarus historically) has been part of the ecosystem.

### The Secretariat (1998) — continuity, capacity and funding
- In 1998 the CBSS established a permanent international Secretariat in Stockholm, funded by member states.
- Purpose: provide continuity across rotating chairmanships, preserve institutional memory, administer projects, and support policy development.
- The Secretariat’s funding model—reliant on member state contributions—creates both a practical capability and a political dependency: secretariat capacity mirrors members’ willingness to sustain financing and political support.

### Functional agenda and partnerships
- Historically the CBSS pursued a broad, pragmatic agenda: environment and Baltic Sea protection (pollution, marine monitoring), regional economic cooperation and transport, education and youth programmes, civil security and emergency rescue cooperation, and human rights/democracy promotion.
- The CBSS has been complementary to other regional bodies (for example HELCOM on the marine environment, the Nordic Council, and EU regional mechanisms). It often functions as a convenor and coordinator rather than duplicating specialist institutions.

### The 2022 suspension of Russia (and Belarus observer status): a critical juncture
- On 3 March 2022, in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, 11 CBSS members issued a declaration immediately suspending Russia from CBSS activities; Belarus (an observer) was also suspended.
- This suspension represents a fundamental shift for a body whose founding logic emphasised inclusive reintegration after the Cold War. Practically, it reduced the Council’s ability to conduct projects requiring Russian participation—most notably any initiatives involving the Russian coastline (environmental monitoring, search‑and‑rescue coordination, fisheries management).
- Politically, the suspension highlights how an externally driven security crisis can re‑politicise a once largely functionalist forum and force a re‑orientation of priorities toward resilience, security and intra‑Western cooperation.

### Operational vulnerabilities and institutional resilience
- Vulnerabilities:
  - Projects requiring cross‑border participation are especially exposed when a member is suspended or withdraws (data sharing, transboundary environmental work, maritime safety).
  - Secretariat and programme continuity depend on sustained political and financial commitment; geopolitical ruptures can trigger funding re‑allocations or de‑prioritisation.
- Sources of resilience:
  - The permanent Secretariat provides institutional memory and administrative stability that help preserve projects during political turbulence.
  - A flexible agenda and the presence of complementary regional bodies allow the Council to reassign work or seek alternative cooperative formats when bilateral or multilateral tracks are blocked.

### Lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy
Several practical takeaways from the CBSS experience are relevant to Indian policymakers and scholars designing or engaging regional institutions (e.g., BIMSTEC, IORA, SAARC’s successors, or India’s bilateral neighbourhood initiatives):

- Institutionalisation matters: A permanent secretariat materially increases continuity, programmatic memory and professional project management. If India seeks long‑lasting regional cooperation frameworks, investing in a small, well‑funded secretariat is often more effective than ad hoc chairmanship arrangements alone.
- Design for heterogeneity: Inclusive, high‑level founding (as with CBSS) can accelerate reintegration and buy political legitimacy. But heterogenous membership (states with divergent strategic outlooks) carries long‑term risks; institutional rules should anticipate mechanisms for managing serious disputes without wholly paralysing cooperation.
- Functionalism has limits: Technical cooperation (environment, transport, disaster relief) can build trust, but political crises can override technical ties. Indian strategy should plan for contingencies—maintaining alternative bilateral channels or modular projects that can continue even if multilateral tracks are disrupted.
- Funding is political: Reliance on member contributions ties operational capacity to political will. Diversified funding mechanisms (multi‑year pledges, external partners, voluntary trust funds) can help stabilise a secretariat’s work.
- Suspension and exclusion are consequential choices: Excluding a major actor from a regional forum may be necessary on normative or security grounds, but it also reduces the forum’s geographical reach and technical capacities. Policymakers must weigh normative imperatives against operational costs.
- Complementarity with specialised bodies: Regional councils that serve as convenors—collaborating with expert bodies—can punch above their weight. India can harness such complementarities (for example, linking diplomatic platforms with technical institutions) to achieve durable outcomes.

Conclusion
The CBSS story—founded as a high‑level, inclusive instrument of post–Cold War regional integration, strengthened through institutionalisation, and tested by a major geopolitical rupture—illustrates the trade‑offs inherent in regional institution‑building. For India, conscious design choices about secretariat capacity, membership rules, funding modalities and contingency planning will determine whether its regional forums are resilient instruments of strategic influence or brittle arrangements that unravel under stress.

## The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS): The Rotating Presidency — Description, Chronology and Analytical Implications for Strategic Practice

Overview
- The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) operates with an annually rotating Presidency among its Member States (the EU participates in the Council but does not hold the Presidency). Each Presidency lasts one year (1 July–30 June) and sets a program of priorities intended to guide the Council’s agenda, mobilize work streams and focus resources for that year.
- The Presidency mechanism is both procedural (steering meetings, hosting, agenda-setting) and political (a signaling device for national priorities). This combination creates recurrent opportunities for direction-setting and, simultaneously, challenges for policy continuity — a feature common to many regional organizations with rotating chairs (ASEAN, IORA, etc.).

Statistical snapshot from the list
- Total listed Presidencies: 33 (1992–1993 through 2024–2025).
- Unique presidency countries appearing: 11 (Estonia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Lithuania, Denmark, Latvia, Sweden, Iceland, Poland, Russia).
- Frequency (counts from the list): Estonia 4; Finland 4; Germany 3; Norway 3; Lithuania 3; Denmark 3; Latvia 3; Sweden 3; Poland 3; Iceland 2; Russia 2.

Patterns, recurring themes and institutional signals
- Environmental sustainability and maritime policy: A persistent theme, growing more explicit in the 2010s and 2020s. Priorities include sustainable development, offshore wind, dumped munitions, stricter maritime environmental standards, and measures to improve the ecological state of the Baltic Sea.
- Civil protection and crisis preparedness: Recurrent across Presidencies (civil protection, crisis preparedness, resilience). This indicates persistent cross-border vulnerability concerns and a securitization of certain non‑traditional risks.
- Humanitarian and social issues: Repeated focus on trafficking in human beings, children’s rights, equality, and people-to-people contacts — reflecting socially framed transnational threats and cooperative soft-security agendas.
- Institutional reform and flexibility: Occasional explicit attention to organizational effectiveness (e.g., “Making the CBSS a More Flexible Organization,” “practicality, efficiency, cooperation”), indicating internal reflection on how to sustain impact given the annual rotation.
- Signaling and national agenda-setting: Presidencies function as instruments for Member States to project national/regional priorities into the multilateral agenda; recent Presidencies emphasize resilience and comprehensive security alongside environmental policy.
- Data gaps and membership nuance: Several early years in the list lack recorded priorities in the provided source. The presence of Russia in the list while the Council is described as having “ten Member States” suggests either historical membership changes or differences in counting methods — a complication that must be resolved via primary sources.

Operational implications inferred from the Presidency model
- Agenda steering in short bursts: Annual Presidencies concentrate agenda-setting power but create potential discontinuities for multi-year projects.
- Necessity of continuity mechanisms: Long-term initiatives require institutional anchors beyond a single Presidency (permanent secretariat, multi-year mandates, working groups, funding streams).
- Resource and partnership targeting: Actors wanting influence should time proposals to align with a Presidency’s program; Presidencies attract particular external funding and diplomatic attention for their chosen priorities.
- Signaling effects: Presidency priorities broadcast where national diplomatic energy and resources will be concentrated that year — useful intelligence for NGOs, funders and other states.

Analytical caveats and data recommendations
- The present analysis is limited to the supplied dataset; many years have no priorities recorded and should be filled from CBSS primary documents (Presidency declarations, annual reports, programmes).
- Russian presidencies appear in earlier years; researchers should investigate membership changes, suspensions, or shifts in participation that explain the apparent mismatch between “ten Member States” and the eleven country names listed.
- “Resilience” and “sustainability” are broad policy umbrellas; disaggregating them into sub-categories (energy, coastal protection, social resilience, governance) is necessary for precise trend analysis.

Methodological suggestions for researchers
- Complete the dataset: cross-check each Presidency year against CBSS official records and Presidency program documents to recover missing priorities.
- Thematic coding: classify each year’s priorities into standardized thematic categories (environment, maritime, civil protection, human trafficking, institutional reform, social policy, security) and quantify frequencies by decade to demonstrate trend lines empirically.
- Event linkage: compare Presidency priorities with contemporaneous regional events (major pollution incidents, security crises, EU policy shifts) to assess exogenous drivers of agenda choices.
- Outcome tracing: use Presidency programmes to identify concrete deliverables (projects, declarations, funding lines) and trace their implementation through annual reports and working group outputs; this distinguishes rhetorical priorities from operational impact.

Implications and comparative lessons for India’s strategic practice
- Rotating-presidency advantages and limits: The CBSS model illustrates how annual chairs can rapidly elevate national priorities in a regional forum. For India, which participates in several regional groupings (e.g., BIMSTEC as Chair, IORA) or as a dialogue partner, the CBSS experience underscores two linked lessons: (1) a rotating chair is a powerful short-term instrument for agenda-setting and signaling; (2) without continuity mechanisms, it risks fragmenting long-term projects.
- Institutional design for continuity: India’s policy planners can draw three design principles: (a) embed multi-year mandates and dedicated secretariat functions for priority areas (e.g., maritime security, disaster response); (b) institutionalize hand-over documents and mid-term reviews to reduce loss of momentum between chairs; (c) pair presidency-driven initiatives with predictable funding commitments or joint task forces to assure follow-through.
- Using presidencies to advance thematic aims: CBSS Presidencies show that issues like maritime environment, dumped munitions, and offshore renewables became priorities when regional salience rose. India should calibrate presidency/programmatic initiatives to both domestic priorities (e.g., blue economy, port security, disaster resilience) and emergent regional drivers to increase traction.
- Signaling and partnerships: Presidency priorities are signals to international partners and funders. India can use chairships in regional fora to signal commitments on niche issues (e.g., climate resilience in the Indian Ocean, counter-trafficking in the Bay of Bengal) and thereby attract technical cooperation and finance.
- Monitoring performance, not only rhetoric: Emulate the CBSS recommendation to track deliverables springing from presidencies; for Indian policymakers, institutionalize indicators of implementation (projects launched, policy harmonization achieved, joint exercises held) to validate the effectiveness of presidency-led agendas.

Concluding note
The CBSS rotating Presidency offers a compact case of how small- and medium-sized states use institutional design to steer regional cooperation. Its recent priorities (resilience, sustainability, maritime/environmental protection, civil protection) reflect the Baltic Sea’s ecological interdependence and evolving security agenda. For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the CBSS experience is instructive for understanding the political economy of agenda-setting in regional organizations: rotating presidencies enable concentrated, visible leadership but require complementary continuity mechanisms and careful calibration to convert annual priorities into durable regional outcomes.

Practical next steps for researchers and policymakers
- Verify the missing priority entries by consulting CBSS Presidency programs and annual reports.
- If engaging with the CBSS or analogous organizations, align proposals with the sitting Presidency’s declared priorities (e.g., Estonia 2024–2025: resilience and sustainability).
- For comparative research, code the CBSS priority data thematically and link changes to external events and membership dynamics to explain shifts in emphasis over time.

# Committee of Senior Officials (CSO)

The Committee of Senior Officials (CSO) is the operational heart of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS). Acting as the principal forum for intergovernmental coordination between Ministerial Sessions, the CSO sustains policy continuity, translates ministerial political direction into programmes and project pipelines, and provides strategic oversight of the CBSS system. This section describes the CSO’s composition, remit, working methods and strategic architecture, and draws out practical implications for external actors and comparative lessons relevant to states engaging with regional organisations.

## Composition and representational logic
- Membership: The CSO is composed of senior representatives from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) of the ten CBSS member states: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland and Sweden.
- European Union representation: A high-level EU representative also participates in CSO meetings. The EU presence serves dual purposes: to reflect EU policy and funding interests in the Baltic region and to facilitate alignment between CBSS activity and EU instruments and priorities.
- Rank and appointment: The national CSO representatives are senior MFA officials — normally at the ambassadorial level — appointed by their respective MFAs. The CSO Chair is similarly appointed by the MFA of the country holding the Council Presidency for that year.

## Core role and decision-making authority
- Principal inter-ministerial forum: The CSO functions as the main discussion forum and decision-making body for CBSS matters in the inter-ministerial interval. It is empowered to maintain continuity of the Council’s work and to make operational decisions that do not require ministerial endorsement.
- Authority and limits: While the CSO wields substantial influence over programming and coordination, major policy shifts or politically sensitive decisions typically require endorsement at Ministerial Sessions or explicit approval by the Presidency. This division preserves political legitimacy while enabling managerial efficiency.
- Continuity and agenda-setting: The CSO’s ambassadorial chairmanship provides diplomatic leadership for agenda setting, prioritisation and annual programme delivery.

## Monitoring, coordination and subordinate structures
- System stewardship: The CSO monitors and aims to coordinate the work of all CBSS structures — including the Secretariat, thematic Expert Groups, and task-specific working bodies — to ensure coherence, avoid duplication, and align activities with strategic goals.
- Expert Groups: Technical and sectoral Expert Groups (for example, on environment, maritime safety, socio-economic development, culture/education) operate under the CSO’s auspices. These groups produce the specialist outputs and project proposals that the CSO steers toward policy uptake and funding.
- Secretariat support: The CBSS Secretariat provides essential administrative and logistical support to the CSO — preparing papers, maintaining records, assisting in follow-up and facilitating communication among members and with external partners.

## Chairmanship, rotation and political dynamics
- Annual rotation: The CSO chairmanship rotates annually in tandem with the Council Presidency, ensuring equal opportunity for member states to shape the CBSS agenda.
- Effects of rotation: Rotation promotes inclusiveness and shared ownership but can produce year-to-year shifts in emphasis as the presiding state imprints its national priorities on the programme. Sustained Secretariat support and clear multi-year frameworks help mitigate discontinuities.
- Practical implication: Stakeholders seeking visibility should engage closely with the MFA of the presiding state and the appointed CSO Chair during that term.

## Strategic priorities and thematic portfolios
The CSO coordinates CBSS activity under three long-term, cross-cutting priorities. Each priority aggregates thematic portfolios that guide programming and project selection.

1. Regional Identity
   - Focus: Culture, education, civil society engagement, cross-border cooperation, and measures that build social cohesion and a shared regional narrative.
   - Examples of activity: Exchange programmes, joint cultural initiatives, education partnerships, civil society capacity-building.

2. Sustainable & Prosperous Region
   - Focus: Economic development, environmental protection (including marine environment), blue economy, innovation and resilience of regional infrastructure.
   - Examples: Environmental monitoring projects, sustainable fisheries and maritime industry initiatives, innovation clusters and entrepreneurship support.

3. Safe & Secure Region
   - Focus: Maritime safety, emergency preparedness, crisis management, security cooperation, and rule of law measures.
   - Examples: Joint exercises for maritime search and rescue, emergency-response capacity-building, rule of law trainings and judicial cooperation.

The CSO coordinates workplans, selects projects and steers resources to align initiatives with these priorities.

## Operational modalities: programming, funding and evaluation
- Alignment and steering: The CSO aligns national contributions, steers project proposals and coordinates funding priorities among CBSS bodies and external partners. This entails selecting which Expert Group outputs are promoted for financing and which projects are elevated to ministerial visibility.
- Monitoring and evaluation: To track progress the CSO often establishes indicators or thematic workplans. These instruments enable cross-cutting assessment of outputs across the three priorities and help translate Expert Group deliverables into measurable policy outcomes.
- EU coordination: The EU representative facilitates access to EU funding and policy frameworks but also means that CBSS activity must reconcile EU-level mandates with member states’ bilateral and regional objectives.

## Risks and constraints
- Variation in capacity: Different administrative capacities among member states can create uneven implementation and follow-through on CSO priorities.
- Political divergence: Domestic political changes or bilateral tensions can affect consensus-building and the CSO’s ability to coordinate effectively.
- Rotational shifts: Annual presidency rotation can cause programme fluctuation and shifting emphasis.
- Mitigation measures: Sustained Secretariat continuity, multi-year strategic frameworks and clear prioritisation criteria reduce these risks and support institutional memory.

## Practical implications for policy and practice
- Engagement strategy: Actors (national MFA units, NGOs, regional agencies, funders) seeking to influence CBSS agendas should engage national CSO representatives — especially the MFA of the presiding country and its appointed CSO Chair — to obtain visibility and influence during the chairing year.
- Project design: Proposals that explicitly map to one or more of the three long-term priorities enjoy a higher likelihood of coordination and endorsement by the CSO; linking technical work to policy-relevant indicators and CSO workplans strengthens prospects for funding.
- Bridging technical-policy divides: Maintaining strong, institutionalised links between Expert Groups and the CSO is essential to translate technical outputs into policy decisions and ministerial outcomes.

## Comparative insight: relevance for India and other middle powers
Although the CBSS is geographically specific, the CSO model—senior MFA representation, rotating chairmanship, a secretariat-supported coordination function and prioritisation around a small set of long-term themes—offers transferable lessons for middle powers like India:
- Strategic entry points in regional forums often lie at the senior-official level; building relationships with MFA counterparts who sit on such committees is crucial.
- Annual presidencies can be leveraged to advance specialised agendas, but durable impact requires embedding initiatives in multi-year priority frameworks supported by the secretariat.
- Linking technical expert outputs to political decision-making through a senior coordination body increases the likelihood of resource mobilisation and policy uptake.

Conclusion
The CSO is the CBSS’s essential coordinating mechanism: it converts political guidance into operational programmes, mediates between technical experts and ministers, and aligns national and EU interests within a shared regional agenda. Its structure—combining senior diplomatic engagement, rotating leadership and secretariat continuity—balances political legitimacy with managerial effectiveness, while presenting predictable entry points for external stakeholders and partners.

### Expert Bodies under the CBSS: Structure, Change and Lessons for India’s Strategic Practice

Summary of the case
- The Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) currently cites three active expert entities: the Expert Group on Sustainable Maritime Economy, the Expert Group on Children at Risk, and the Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings.  
- Separately, the CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development — which had been responsible for managing the Baltic 2030 Action Plan — ceased operating in 2023.  
- The juxtaposition of active subject-specific groups and the closure of the sustainable-development custodian highlights both the CBSS’s reliance on specialist implementation structures and the vulnerability of regional programmes when stewardship is withdrawn.

Why expert groups matter: functions and institutional role
- Expert groups are the operational layer of multilateral governance. They translate political mandates into policy instruments, coordinate projects, exchange technical knowledge, and build cross-border networks among member states, civil society and international partners.  
- Within regional organisations like the CBSS they serve several discrete functions:
  - Agenda operationalisation: converting broad political commitments into workplans, indicators and projects.  
  - Capacity pooling and norm diffusion: convening technical experts to harmonise standards and share best practice.  
  - Implementation and monitoring: managing project delivery, reporting and data collection.  
  - Partner mobilisation: linking member states with regional conventions, UN agencies and donor programmes.

Remits and priorities of the named CBSS bodies (inferred)
- Expert Group on Sustainable Maritime Economy
  - Likely focus: promoting a sustainable blue economy, green shipping, resilient port operations, marine environmental protection and coastal climate adaptation.  
  - Relevance: combines economic development with environmental stewardship — a core regional security concern where state and non-state actors intersect.
- Expert Group on Children at Risk
  - Likely focus: cross-border child protection, prevention of abuse and exploitation, harmonisation of welfare responses and strengthening services for vulnerable children.  
  - Relevance: an area of human security with law-and-order, social-policy and interstate welfare dimensions.
- Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings
  - Likely focus: prevention, victim identification and protection, law-enforcement cooperation, prosecution, and victim-centred policies.  
  - Relevance: classic transnational crime problem requiring operational cooperation, information-sharing and victim support systems.

The Baltic 2030 stewardship gap: implications of the Sustainable Development group’s closure
- The CBSS Expert Group on Sustainable Development had managerial responsibility for the Baltic 2030 Action Plan. Its cessation in 2023 therefore creates an institutional gap:
  - Immediate risk of discontinuity in monitoring, reporting and project oversight for Baltic 2030 commitments.  
  - Loss of a single, identifiable custodian can fragment responsibility across other bodies, diluting accountability.  
  - Without clear reallocation, funding streams, indicator maintenance and institutional memory are endangered.
- Operational pathways when a custodian dissolves:
  - Tasks can be reassigned to other expert groups or a temporary task force; transferred to a lead member state; or entrusted to partner organisations (EU bodies, UN agencies, regional conventions). Each option carries trade-offs in authority, legitimacy and continuity.

Partners, comparators and continuity mechanisms
- Effective continuity often depends on existing partnerships: environmental conventions (HELCOM), EU programmes, UN agencies (e.g., UNICEF for child protection) and law-enforcement networks. These actors can absorb or co-manage functions but require formal handovers.  
- Monitoring and custodianship require: preserved data and documentation, designated reporting responsibilities, secured funding for ongoing tasks, and retained personnel or institutional memory.

Implications and recommendations—what this means for policy and security practice
Immediate implication
- There is a demonstrable stewardship gap for Baltic 2030 that risks loss of momentum on regional sustainable-development objectives.

Short-term recommendations
- Identify and designate interim custodians for Baltic 2030 tasks. Pragmatic options include:
  - Assigning responsibility to an existing CBSS expert group whose remit overlaps (e.g., Sustainable Maritime Economy for marine-related items).  
  - Appointing a temporary task force or a lead member state to hold the workstream in trust.  
  - Entrusting management to an external partner (EU programme office, UN entity) with clear time-bound terms.

Medium-term recommendations
- Conduct a formal mapping of Baltic 2030 functions to be reassigned (monitoring, reporting, project management, funding), and execute a managed handover of data, contracts and deliverables from the closed group.  
- Institute explicit reporting lines and measurable indicators under the new custodian(s) to preserve transparency and accountability.

Cross-cutting recommendation
- Strengthen institutional linkages between active expert groups (maritime economy, children at risk, anti-trafficking) to avoid silo effects and to capitalise on integrated approaches to regional security and welfare.

Strategic recommendation
- Engage external partners early to secure continuity of financing, technical expertise and implementation capacity. Formal memoranda of understanding will reduce risks associated with informal or ad-hoc arrangements.

Lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Institutional custodianship matters: India’s strategic practice — whether in regional initiatives (IORA, BIMSTEC, SCO) or national inter‑ministerial reforms — benefits when technical workstreams have explicit, sustainable custodianship. The CBSS episode underscores how political commitments (action plans) require durable administrative homes to avoid policy drift.
- Specialist bodies as force-multipliers: expert groups are effective at bridging diplomacy, technical policy and operational delivery. India should consider replicating such modular specialist units within its regional diplomacy architecture to sustain cross-border initiatives (maritime environment, anti-trafficking, human security).
- Cross-sectoral integration and human security: the CBSS grouping (maritime economy, child protection, anti-trafficking) illustrates that “security” is multi-dimensional. Indian national security doctrine, increasingly attentive to human and environmental security, can draw from such models to integrate welfare, criminal justice and economic resilience in a single regional portfolio.
- Managing transitions and institutional memory: India’s engagements should build explicit handover mechanisms and data stewardship protocols when expert bodies are restructured or closed — to preserve project continuity and avoid reputational costs.
- Partnering strategically: where capacity gaps exist, India can seek custodianship partnerships with multilateral institutions (UN agencies, development banks) that can provide continuity while enhancing India’s regional leadership credentials.

Concluding note
The CBSS example is a compact case study in how regional organisations operationalise policy through expert bodies, and of the vulnerabilities that arise when custodial capacities lapse. For Indian policymakers and strategists, the lesson is clear: durable institutional design, explicit custodianship, and proactive partner engagement are not administrative niceties but essential ingredients of resilient strategic practice.

## The Permanent International Secretariat of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS): establishment, premises history and formal mandate

This short analytical account examines the creation, physical locus and formal responsibilities of the permanent International Secretariat of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS). Though focused on a specific regional organisation in Northern Europe, the Secretariat’s design and functions illustrate institutional responses to recurring governance problems faced by multilateral bodies: continuity across rotating political leaderships, professional administration of programmes, preservation of institutional memory, and sustained external engagement. These are themes of direct relevance to comparative study in strategic culture and national security policy.

### Establishment and inauguration
- A permanent International Secretariat for the CBSS was established by decision of the Council at its 7th Ministerial Session in Nyborg, Denmark, in 1998.
- The Secretariat was officially inaugurated on 20 October 1998 at Strömsborg island in central Stockholm.
- The move to create a permanent, professional secretariat followed years of ad hoc administrative arrangements and responded to perceived needs for continuity, programme management capacity and an institutional anchor for the CBSS’s expanding activities.

### Premises history (selected timeline)
- Inauguration: Strömsborg, Stockholm (20 October 1998).
- November 2010 – July 2020: Räntmästarhuset, Slussplan 9, Stockholm.
- Since July 2020: Momma Reenstiernas Palace, Wollmar Yxkullsgatan 23, Stockholm.

The sequence of relocations—from Strömsborg to Räntmästarhuset and then to Momma Reenstiernas Palace—reflects routine operational dynamics of secretariats: changing spatial needs, representational considerations, lease or ownership realities, security and accessibility requirements, and image-building. Stockholm’s role as host signals Sweden’s tangible support and situates the Secretariat in a well-connected Nordic diplomatic hub, easing contact with other regional and international actors.

### Formal mandate: five core responsibilities and practical implications
The CBSS Secretariat’s mandate can be usefully divided into five core responsibilities. Each carries operational consequences for staffing, funding and institutional design.

1. Provide technical and organisational support to the Chairman of the CBSS and to the Council’s structures and working bodies
   - Functions: secretarial duties, logistical planning, meeting organisation, substantive backstopping for policy deliberations and project cycles.
   - Implication: requires a mix of administrative, policy-analytic and project-management capacity; flexibility to service both high-level political fora and technical working groups.

2. Ensure continuity and enhanced coordination of CBSS activities
   - Functions: act as institutional memory, maintain programme continuity across rotating national Chairs, coordinate activities among multiple actors and time horizons.
   - Implication: demands robust record-keeping, project-tracking systems and continuity mechanisms (e.g., handover protocols) to translate political mandates into sustained operations.

3. Implement the CBSS Information and Communication Strategy
   - Functions: public outreach, branding, messaging, stakeholder communication, media engagement.
   - Implication: requires professional communications capacity, multilingual outreach and effective digital platforms to reach diverse audiences across member states.

4. Maintain the CBSS archives and information database
   - Functions: archival stewardship, records management, access provision and preservation.
   - Implication: critical for accountability, evaluation and historical research; calls for deliberate digital preservation policies, metadata standards and access regimes that balance transparency with confidentiality where required.

5. Maintain contacts with other organisations in and around the Baltic Sea region, with national authorities of Member States and with the media
   - Functions: external relations, partnership management, liaison and representational duties on behalf of the CBSS.
   - Implication: necessitates active diplomacy, partnership-building skills and a strategic approach to cooperation with EU bodies, regional organisations, NGOs and bilateral actors to avoid duplication and to leverage resources.

### Additional observations: institutional logic and operational realities
- A permanent international secretariat is a common governance mechanism used by regional and multilateral organisations to secure institutional stability beyond the rhythm of rotating political chairs. It converts episodic political attention into sustained institutional activity.
- Hosting the Secretariat in Stockholm places it in a major Nordic policy and diplomatic centre, improving access to international organisations and visiting delegations; host-state support often reduces operating costs and confers representational legitimacy.
- Relocations of premises typically stem from a combination of pragmatic needs (space, security, accessibility), financial constraints (lease vs. ownership), and symbolic considerations (representational profile).
- Archival stewardship is not merely bureaucratic: it underpins institutional memory, enables evidence-based policymaking, and legitimates accountability claims. Digital preservation and clear access policies are now indispensable elements of this work.
- Implementing an effective Information and Communication Strategy implies investments in multilingual communications, social and traditional media capacity, and user-friendly digital platforms to bridge varied stakeholder environments across member states.
- Proactive maintenance of external contacts is a continuous task: the Secretariat must manage partnerships with EU institutions, neighbouring regional organisations and civil society to generate synergies, avoid overlap and mobilise co-funding.

### Implications and recommendations
- Institutional centrality: The Secretariat is the institutional backbone of the CBSS; underfunding or institutional weakening would degrade coordination, continuity and programme delivery.
- Digital archives and open access: Prioritise investment in robust digital archival systems and adopt open-access policies, where appropriate, to strengthen transparency, facilitate research, and protect institutional memory.
- Communications capacity: Ensure dedicated, multilingual communications staffing and modern digital tools to operationalise the Information and Communication Strategy and to reach diverse audiences across the region.
- Premises planning: Regularly assess premises for security, accessibility and representational suitability; maintain contingency plans to avoid operational disruption during relocations.
- Partnership strategy: Maintain proactive liaison with EU bodies, other regional organisations and civil society to reduce duplication, secure co-financing and create complementarities for Baltic Sea projects.
- Depoliticisation and funding diversification: Political shifts among member states can influence priorities and resourcing. Safeguards—neutral professional administration, transparent procedures and diversified funding—reduce politicisation risks and enhance resilience.

### Comparative note: lessons relevant to India’s strategic-institutional thinking
Although the CBSS and its Secretariat operate in a distinct regional context, several lessons are pertinent for scholars and practitioners concerned with India’s strategic culture and national security institutions:
- Institutional memory matters: For any rotating chairmanship or time-limited initiative, a permanent secretariat or equivalent professional backbone preserves continuity and converts episodic political attention into durable programmes.
- Communications and transparency: Contemporary strategic influence requires credible, well-resourced communications and archival transparency; India’s international engagement benefits from similar investments in messaging and record-keeping.
- Host-state symbolism and operational advantage: The location of secretariats and headquarters conveys diplomatic signals and delivers practical networking advantages — a factor India should weigh when hosting regional fora.
- Resilience against politicisation: Maintaining a neutral, professional administrative cadre and diversified funding sources can insulate multilateral initiatives from abrupt political changes and sustain long-term security cooperation.

In short, the CBSS Secretariat exemplifies how an organisational instrument—modest in size but central in function—can sustain regional cooperation. For analysts of strategic culture, it underscores the institutional tools by which states translate short-term political mandates into long-term policy capabilities.

### Institutionalised Multilateral Coordination: The CBSS Annual Coordination Meetings and Lessons for Strategic Practice

Since the 10th Ministerial Session of the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) in 2001 the Council deliberately intensified efforts to coordinate its activities with other actors engaged in Baltic Sea regional cooperation. This shift was operationalised through the creation of annual coordination meetings, chaired by the CBSS Committee of Senior Officials (CSO) Chair, which provide a recurrent, institutionalised forum for strategic partners to voice concerns, align programmes and reduce duplication. Examining the design, composition and intended effects of this mechanism yields both empirical insight into regional governance in Europe and practical lessons for states—like India—seeking to consolidate multilateral coordination as part of their strategic culture and national security policy.

Temporal and institutional anchor
- Change began in 2001 (CBSS 10th Ministerial Session): the CBSS moved from largely ad hoc contacts toward a formal rhythm of interaction with peer organisations. Establishing an annual cadence was intended to routinise dialogue and make coordination predictable rather than episodic.
- Organisational responsibility: the meetings are organised and presided over by the CSO Chair, embedding the practice within the CBSS’s senior official structure and signalling that coordination is a core, not peripheral, function.

Mechanism and purpose
- Mechanism created: an annual multi‑stakeholder coordination meeting that brings together governmental, subnational, civil society, academic and business actors active in the Baltic Sea Region.
- Purpose: to create a structured channel for strategic partners to raise concerns, exchange information and align activities—shifting the region from fragmented activity to greater coherence and complementarity.
- Emphasis on structure: the meetings institutionalise what was previously informal contact, with the explicit aim of decreasing duplication and improving collective identification of priorities.

Who participates: composition and roles
The coordination forum is deliberately broad. Its participants include specialised intergovernmental bodies, parliamentary and subnational networks, civil society forums, academic consortia and private‑sector advisory groups. Key partners commonly engaged are:

- B7 (Baltic Seven Islands): a subregional island network that brings local/island perspectives into regional debates.
- BASTUN (Baltic Sea Trade Union Network): represents labour and social policy perspectives, ensuring workers’ interests are incorporated into regional policymaking.
- BCCA (Baltic Chamber of Commerce–type actors): chambers/commerce networks that articulate business and trade concerns.
- Baltic Sea Forum: a platform for policy dialogue and stakeholder networking across the region.
- BSPC (Baltic Sea Parliamentary Conference): inter‑parliamentary assembly that connects national and regional legislators to the regional policy process.
- BSRUN (Baltic Sea Region University Network): fosters academic collaboration, research exchange and knowledge generation.
- BSSSC (Baltic Sea States Subregional Cooperation): networks of regional and local authorities promoting cross‑border and subnational priorities.
- BUP / Baltic academic programmes: contribute expertise, capacity building and higher education linkages.
- Business Advisory Council (Baltic Sea): represents private‑sector perspectives on economic cooperation and competitiveness.
- CPMR (Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions): advocates for maritime and peripheral regional development within European policy spaces.
- HELCOM (Helsinki Commission): the principal intergovernmental body for coordinating protection of the Baltic marine environment.
- IOM (International Organization for Migration): brings expertise on migration management and social policy implications.
- NGO Forum: aggregates civil society voices—environmental, social and civic actors.
- OECD: offers policy analysis, institutional best practice and comparative data relevant to regional economic strategies.
- ScanBalt Forum: clusters innovation and life‑science cooperation across borders.
- UBC (Union of the Baltic Cities): a municipal network focused on urban sustainability and local governance.

(Each partner brings distinct mandates and comparative advantages—environmental stewardship, labour representation, parliamentary oversight, subnational governance, academic research, business interests—which is precisely why a coordination forum is valuable.)

Implications for regional governance and policy coherence
- Reduced duplication, increased coherence: by mapping programmes and aligning calendars, the CBSS sought to avoid parallel efforts and ensure complementary action across sectors (environmental, economic, social and educational).
- Multi‑stakeholder legitimacy: including state, substate and non‑state actors enriches deliberation and increases the legitimacy of regional initiatives.
- Convenor role: the CBSS positions itself primarily as a neutral convener and coordinator, not the sole implementer—an important distinction that enables mediation among actors with overlapping aims.
- Risks and constraints: overlapping mandates (e.g., HELCOM’s environmental authority vs. UBC’s urban remit) can create friction; broad participation complicates decision‑making and requires clear role delineation and follow‑up mechanisms.
- External linkages: engaging actors such as the OECD and IOM connects regional work to global policy frameworks and technical assistance opportunities, opening funding and analytic resources.

Effectiveness considerations
- Predictability vs. follow‑through: annual meetings establish rhythm, but their value depends on concrete follow‑up—shared workplans, monitoring frameworks and resource commitments.
- Information sharing and transparency: without common repositories (project databases, calendars, contact registers), coordination remains vulnerable to fragmentation.
- Measurement and evaluation: periodic assessment (every 3–5 years) of the coordination mechanism’s impact is necessary to adapt participation, format and outputs.

Practical recommendations (transferable to other regional contexts)
The CBSS experience suggests a set of practical measures that can strengthen multilateral coordination—relevant for Indian regional initiatives (e.g., Indian Ocean Rim Association, BIMSTEC, subnational coastal cooperation) and for national strategies that seek to institutionalise cooperation as part of strategic culture:

1. Map mandates and activities
   - Conduct a systematic mapping of partner mandates, programmes and geographic scope to identify overlaps, complementarities and gaps. Use the map to design joint workplans.

2. Institutionalise follow‑up mechanisms
   - Translate meeting outcomes into actionable plans with assigned leads, timelines and measurable indicators. Annual dialogue must be coupled with mid‑term deliverables.

3. Develop shared information platforms
   - Create a common calendar, project repository and contact database to increase transparency and reduce duplication of effort.

4. Formalise selective partnerships
   - Where interests align strongly, adopt MoUs or joint initiatives (for example: CBSS + HELCOM on marine environment projects). Formalisation clarifies roles and resource commitments.

5. Ensure balanced representation and rotating leadership
   - Maintain participation from state, substate, civil society, business and academia; rotate thematic leadership to sustain engagement and to avoid capture by any single constituency.

6. Secure co‑funding and resource sharing
   - Assess financial implications and pursue co‑funding arrangements to underwrite joint activities identified at coordination meetings.

7. Periodic evaluation and adaptation
   - Evaluate the utility and impact of the coordination mechanism every 3–5 years and adapt format, scope and participation accordingly.

Comparative takeaway for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For India, integrating lessons from the CBSS approach can aid the evolution of a strategic culture that privileges institutionalised coordination in multifaceted regional theaters—especially the Indian Ocean Region. Key points for Indian policymakers:

- Convening as strategy: India can enhance its influence by adopting a convenor role—creating predictable forums that aggregate state, substate and non‑state expertise rather than attempting unilateral leadership.
- Multi‑level inclusion: bringing subnational actors (states, port cities), parliamentary voices, academia, business and civil society into formal coordination strengthens policy design and implementation credibility.
- Institutionalising rhythm and follow‑through: annual (or regular) coordination forums must be paired with concrete follow‑up mechanisms; otherwise predictability does not translate into policy coherence.
- Mapping and role clarity: rigorous mapping of mandates (domestic ministries, regional organisations, international partners) prevents mission creep and duplication—critical where security, development and environmental objectives intersect.
- Linking regional and global fora: engaging transnational organisations (OECD‑type analytical partners or UN agencies) helps align regional initiatives with broader normative and funding regimes.

Conclusion
The CBSS’s move in 2001 to institutionalise annual coordination meetings exemplifies a pragmatic approach to regional governance: predictable forums, broad participation and an emphasis on convening rather than commanding. For states refining their strategic culture—particularly those with wide-ranging regional interests like India—the lessons are clear: routine, structured coordination across diverse actors increases coherence and legitimacy, but only if coupled with mapped mandates, formalised follow‑up, shared information systems and periodic evaluation. These practices convert multilateral dialogue from an end in itself into a durable instrument of policy and security.

### Case study: The CBSS decision to mainstream three long‑term priorities (June 2014)

What happened
- In June 2014 the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) adopted a deliberate restructuring of its strategic agenda. Following an evaluation and review of its prior framework, the Council moved from five long‑term priorities to three “renewed” long‑term priorities. Those three were articulated as: Regional Identity; Sustainable & Prosperous Region; and Safe & Secure Region. Crucially, the Council decided these priorities were to be “mainstreamed” — integrated across the Council’s full portfolio of activities rather than treated as stand‑alone themes.

Process and immediate meaning
- The decision was not ad hoc. It followed a formal evaluation and review process, signalling institutional reflexivity: the CBSS assessed the utility and practicability of its existing targets and opted to condense and update them. The shift from five to three priorities represents strategic streamlining: concentrating limited political, administrative and financial capital around fewer, higher‑level objectives. The term “mainstream” denotes a cross‑cutting approach — these priorities were intended to inform project selection, programme design, reporting and everyday operational decisions across CBSS organs and initiatives.

Why the timing mattered
- The mid‑2014 timing is analytically salient. European security dynamics were in flux that year, with rising concerns about regional stability. Such external political context often shapes priority‑setting in intergovernmental organisations: the emphasis on a “Safe & Secure Region” can be read in light of contemporaneous anxieties about security, resilience and rule of law in the neighbourhood.

What each renewed priority encompassed (typical areas of activity)
- Regional Identity: activities aimed at strengthening people‑to‑people ties and shared culture — cultural cooperation, youth and educational exchanges, joint historical and civic projects, and initiatives intended to foster a regional sense of belonging across borders.
- Sustainable & Prosperous Region: programmes focused on environmental stewardship (notably marine and coastal protection), sustainable economic development and green growth, transport and connectivity, innovation, and labour‑market cooperation to enhance inclusive prosperity.
- Safe & Secure Region: measures to bolster maritime safety, emergency preparedness and response, border and migration management, rule of law promotion, societal resilience to crises (including cyber and hybrid threats) and cooperation on criminal justice and policing where relevant.

Institutional implications and implementation requirements
- Mainstreaming is a strategic choice that requires operational translation. It implies that the CBSS needed to:
  - Reconfigure work plans of the Committee of Senior Officials and subordinate bodies to align with the three priorities.
  - Designate lead agencies or task forces for cross‑cutting themes so that projects were not siloed.
  - Adjust budgetary allocations and grant or project selection criteria to reflect priority weighting.
  - Establish indicators and monitoring mechanisms to report progress across the mainstreamed priorities.
  - Seek ministerial or political endorsement for the revamped framework to secure legitimacy and accountability.

Governance and coordination
- Effective mainstreaming requires governance clarity: who coordinates across sectors? Typically, the CBSS would need ministerial buy‑in, clear mandates for coordinators (e.g., permanent secretariat units or rotating chairs), and formal reporting lines so that the mainstreamed priorities become part of routine oversight rather than rhetorical labels.

Stakeholders and inter‑organisational linkages
- The decision affected an array of actors: member states’ capitals and relevant ministries, regional bodies (HELCOM, VASAB), EU institutions where overlap exists, local and regional governments, NGOs, academic partners and private‑sector collaborators. Mainstreaming also presupposes active coordination with specialised organisations — for example environmental actions require HELCOM engagement; spatial planning requires VASAB coordination. Overlap with EU Baltic Sea strategies necessitates deliberate policy sequencing and complementarity.

Monitoring, evaluation and accountability
- For mainstreaming to be meaningful it must be measurable. The CBSS needed to develop measurable objectives, indicators and periodic reporting. Without such frameworks, mainstreamed priorities risk becoming rhetorical headings with little effect on resource allocation or outcomes. A robust M&E system would allow the Council to track whether projects were reoriented, whether funding followed priorities, and what impact the reshaped agenda produced.

Interpretation for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- The CBSS example offers relevant institutional lessons for Indian policy‑makers and analysts concerned with strategic culture:
  - Prioritisation under constraint: India’s diplomatic and security apparatus, confronted with many competing regional and global demands, can benefit from strategic streamlining — concentrating effort on a few actionable priorities while ensuring those priorities cut across relevant ministries and agencies.
  - Mainstreaming as an operational principle: Treating priorities as cross‑cutting rather than sectoral silos encourages whole‑of‑government responses — especially important for complex issues like maritime security, climate resilience and economic connectivity in India’s neighbourhood.
  - Context matters: External shocks or shifts in the security environment will push organisations to recalibrate. India’s strategic choices (for example in the Indian Ocean Region) should remain adaptive to geopolitical changes while institutionalising mechanisms that permit rapid reorientation.
  - Governance and M&E: Political endorsement, clear administrative responsibilities, and measurable indicators are indispensable if stated priorities are to produce real policy change. India’s experience with national security and cross‑ministry strategies (e.g., maritime domain awareness, disaster preparedness) underlines the need for better integrated monitoring and accountability mechanisms.
  - Inter‑institutional coordination: As in the Baltic example, effective regional action often requires coordination with specialised bodies — for India, that means linking central policy with state governments, regional forums (e.g., BIMSTEC, IORA) and technical agencies.

Recommendations for further study
- To assess how deeply mainstreaming changed practice, review the CBSS ministerial declaration and subsequent work plans from June 2014 onward, map CBSS projects against the three priorities, and examine budgetary and reporting changes. Comparative study of CBSS and analogous regional bodies offers fertile ground for evaluating how small‑multilateral institutions translate strategic simplification into operational outcomes — a useful comparative frame for India’s efforts to institutionalise cross‑cutting national security priorities.

This case demonstrates that strategic consolidation and the rhetoric of mainstreaming are necessary but not sufficient. Institutional design — explicit mandates, funding alignment, monitoring metrics and inter‑organisational linkages — determines whether renewed priorities reshape behaviour or remain declaratory.

### Chapter X: Building a Macro‑Regional Identity — The Baltic Sea Region as a Model for People‑Centred Regionalism

Goal and objective
- Goal: to create and strengthen a shared Baltic Sea Region identity.
- Objective: to formulate and promote what it means to "belong" to the Baltic Sea Region by intensifying cross‑border contacts and nurturing a sense of community through engagement, participation and multilevel governance.

This concise formulation captures both symbolic and instrumental aims: to craft narratives and symbols that resonate across societies, and simultaneously to weave practical ties (policy coordination, exchanges, joint projects) that make the identity meaningful in everyday life.

Conceptual foundations: symbolic and practical dimensions
Developing a regional identity is inherently dual‑track. On the one hand there are symbolic resources — shared history, cultural practices, collective narratives and branding — that provide cognitive frames for belonging. On the other hand there are practical ties — economic interdependence, joint environmental management, academic and civic exchanges — that convert symbols into lived experience. A sustainable regional identity combines both: narratives without practice are hollow; cooperation without narrative lacks adhesive power.

Principal means and mechanisms
- Engagement and participation: Active involvement of citizens, civil society, youth and local actors makes identity endogenous rather than imposed. Mechanisms include youth exchanges, cultural festivals, twin‑town programmes, and participatory consultations.
- Multilevel governance: Coordination must span municipalities, regions, national governments, EU bodies and macro‑regional institutions (e.g., Council of the Baltic Sea States — CBSS; HELCOM; actors under the EU Strategy for the Baltic Sea Region — EUSBSR). Multilevel architectures permit policy alignment while retaining local legitimacy.
- Community spirit: Deliberate cultivation of shared values — reciprocity, stewardship of the sea, openness — encourages cooperative attitudes that extend beyond transactional collaboration.
- People‑to‑people contacts: Direct interaction through student exchanges, joint research projects, NGO partnerships and civil society networks produces inter‑personal bonds that are durable and trust‑building.
- Dialogue and forums: Structured conversations — stakeholder forums, consultative panels, thematic conferences — institutionalize exchange of perspectives and reduce misperceptions.
- Macro‑regional networks and institutions: Regional bodies provide platforms for project coordination, resource mobilisation and dissemination of best practice; they can institutionalize identity work without supplanting national narratives.

Stakeholders
- Intergovernmental: CBSS and its Secretariat; national ministries (culture, foreign affairs, regional development, environment); EU institutions and EUSBSR actors.
- Subnational: counties, municipalities and regional governments.
- Civil society and culture: NGOs, cultural institutions, civic networks.
- Academia and education: universities, research centres, exchange programmes.
- Private sector: tourism operators, cross‑border businesses and chambers of commerce.
- Communication: media organisations and digital platforms that mediate narratives.

Benefits of successful implementation
- Strengthened social cohesion and cross‑border trust.
- More effective collaboration on shared challenges (environmental protection of the Baltic Sea, transport connectivity, emergency preparedness).
- Greater mobility for people, ideas and goods; increased cultural exchange and tourism.
- Enhanced capacity for multilevel policy making and project delivery.
- Economic gains from regional branding and more integrated markets.
- Resilience to divisive politics by offering alternative, positive narratives grounded in common interests.

Challenges and risks
- Linguistic and cultural diversity complicates the crafting of a single, resonant narrative.
- Historical grievances and geopolitical tensions can undermine trust-building.
- Uneven economic development fosters perceptions of winners and losers, potentially producing backlash.
- Elite‑driven or top‑down initiatives risk exclusion and can delegitimise the project in the public eye.
- Funding instability and limited institutional capacity threaten longevity.
- Coordination fatigue: overlapping mandates and many actors can produce inefficiency and duplication.

Recommended actions (operational priorities)
1. Define a clear, inclusive conceptual framework for "Baltic Sea Region identity" through broad stakeholder consultation, ensuring minority voices and language diversity are respected.
2. Prioritise concrete people‑to‑people projects with predictable, multi‑year funding: youth exchanges, joint cultural programmes, cross‑border research clusters.
3. Establish measurable indicators for identity‑building: periodic public surveys on sense of belonging, counts of cross‑border activities, demographic diversity in participation.
4. Use existing macro‑regional institutions (CBSS, EUSBSR) to coordinate and reduce duplication while devolving implementation locally.
5. Design communications and branding that reflect pluralism — a brand that signals diversity within shared values (e.g., environmental stewardship of the Baltic Sea).
6. Ensure multilevel governance structures integrate local authorities and civil society to increase legitimacy and durability.
7. Continuously monitor geopolitical trends and adapt engagement strategies to mitigate tensions and safeguard people‑to‑people links.

Suggested metrics for monitoring progress
- Annual number and diversity (type, sectoral spread) of people‑to‑people events and exchanges.
- Participant counts and demographic diversity (age, nationality, language) in engagement activities.
- Public opinion metrics measuring sense of belonging to the Baltic Sea Region over time.
- Number and budget of cross‑border projects and institutional collaborations.
- Media exposure and audience reach of regional identity communications.
- Funding committed and reliably disbursed for regional identity initiatives.

Relevance and lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although geographically distant, the Baltic Sea Region presents instructive lessons for policymakers concerned with India’s strategic culture and neighbourhood policy. India’s security environment increasingly recognizes non‑military sources of resilience — social cohesion, institutionalised networks and environmental cooperation — as strategic assets. Key takeaways:
- Soft‑power infrastructure matters: systematic people‑to‑people exchanges, academic linkages, and cultural diplomacy create durable constituencies for cooperation that complement hard security measures.
- Multilevel governance is crucial: engaging municipalities, states and civil society in neighbourhood initiatives increases legitimacy and operational effectiveness.
- Narrative plus practice: an inclusive regional identity narrative gains traction when paired with tangible benefits (connectivity projects, joint environmental action, trade facilitation).
- Risk management: anticipate and mitigate elite capture and unequal benefits; ensure funding stability to avoid boom‑and‑bust cycles.
- Environmental cooperation as a security wedge: shared natural‑resource challenges (coastal security, climate risks) offer apolitical, high‑utility platforms for cooperation that buttress strategic trust.

Concluding remark
The Baltic Sea Region’s identity‑building project demonstrates that regional identity is not an abstract luxury but an operational tool for governance and security. For states like India, integrating people‑centred regionalism into national strategy can diversify instruments of influence, strengthen resilience in the neighbourhood, and provide an enduring complement to traditional security policies.

## Section: Regional Sustainability as Strategic Practice — Lessons from the Baltic Sea Model for India's Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Summary
- The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) initiative frames regional development as an integrated project of sustainable prosperity: efficient resource use, technological and social innovation, environmental protection, and strengthened social cohesion.
- Its policy priorities span competitiveness, green and low‑carbon transition, ecosystem recovery and resilience, and mainstreaming sustainability across sectors. These priorities illustrate how environmental governance and economic strategy can be incorporated into a region’s broader security and strategic posture.
- For India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the BSR offers a concrete template for treating environmental and socio‑economic resilience as core components of national and regional security.

Goals and Objectives (BSR model, reframed for Indian regional strategy)
- Goal: Develop the maritime and coastal regions as models of sustainable, prosperous societies that enhance national and regional security by reducing vulnerability and fostering resilience.
- Emphasize efficient management and use of natural and human resources across jurisdictions to minimize strategic friction and resource competition.
- Harness economic, technological, ecological and social innovation to sustain prosperity — thereby reducing drivers of instability.
- Combine prosperity with environmental protection and social cohesion to create conditions that are less susceptible to conflict and disruption.
- Remove institutional and operational obstacles that hamper comprehensive and sustainable regional development.

Core objectives to integrate into India’s regional security policy
- Improve competitiveness of coastal and maritime economies through sustainable economic growth and diversification.
- Strengthen labour markets and social inclusion as part of resilience-building and to counter destabilising migration pressures.
- Boost research and development and technology adoption as drivers of strategic autonomy and competitive advantage.
- Develop innovative infrastructure and integrated maritime policies to support secure trade, connectivity, and environmental stewardship.
- Improve transport and communications to enhance connectivity, deterrence through assured logistics, and market access that binds regional partners.
- Support the transition to a competitive, green and low‑carbon economy to align economic policy with climate risk management.
- Restore and maintain a “good environmental status” of seas, coasts and watersheds to protect food security, fisheries, and critical ecosystems.
- Strengthen capacity to adapt to climate change and increase resilience of ecosystems and societies, reducing security risks from disasters and displacement.
- Mainstream sustainable development across governance levels and sectors; integrate economic, social and environmental considerations into strategic planning.
- Promote sustainable and green technologies to protect ecosystems and foster strategic-industrial capabilities.

Why this matters for India’s strategic culture
- Strategic culture historically centered on territory, military capability and diplomatic posture must broaden to include ecological resilience, energy transitions and socio‑economic cohesion.
- Environmental degradation, sea‑level rise, and disrupted fisheries are security factors: they can catalyse humanitarian crises, interstate tensions, and non‑state instability.
- Incorporating sustainability into strategy strengthens deterrence by reducing vulnerabilities (e.g., resilient supply chains, distributed energy, adaptable infrastructure) and increases soft power through regional public goods.

Key thematic priorities (translation into policy domains)
- Sustainable economic growth and innovation: Prioritise green industrial clusters, ports with low emissions, and coastal value chains that generate employment while preserving ecosystems.
- Environmental protection and marine recovery: Tackle eutrophication, pollution, biodiversity loss and overfishing with science‑based, cooperative measures.
- Climate adaptation and resilience: Prepare coastal communities and critical infrastructure for sea‑level rise, storm surge and changing monsoon patterns.
- Social cohesion and inclusive labour markets: Address urban‑rural and coastal‑inland disparities; invest in skills for green jobs to preempt socio‑economic grievance.
- Mainstreaming: Embed sustainability into defence infrastructure planning, economic policy, and regional diplomacy.

Alignment with global frameworks
- The BSR approach mirrors the UN 2030 Agenda and SDGs (notably SDG 13, SDG 14, SDG 8, SDG 9). India’s national strategies — from NDCs under the Paris Agreement to national SDG implementation plans — can be harnessed to operationalise a security‑sensitive sustainability agenda.
- Regional instruments (analogous to EUSBSR and HELCOM) provide institutional architecture for cooperation; India can adapt the principle of dedicated regional commissions or working groups for the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea littoral.

Regional instruments, partners and governance
- Typical partners: national and state governments, municipalities, research institutions, private sector, civil society, and multilateral/bilateral agencies.
- Institutional mechanisms: cross‑border task forces, integrated maritime spatial planning bodies, scientific secretariats for monitoring, and ministerial coordination councils linking environment, defence, transport and fisheries.
- For India: leverage existing platforms (BIMSTEC, IORA, Bay of Bengal initiatives) and consider new sub‑regional instruments focused on sustainability and maritime resilience.

Practical implementation tools
- Cross‑border cooperation projects (e.g., nutrient reduction or mangrove restoration across shared watersheds).
- Policy harmonisation for shipping standards, pollution control, and fisheries management.
- Integrated maritime spatial planning to coordinate economic use and conservation.
- Green infrastructure investments (climate‑resilient ports, nature‑based coastal defence).
- Public‑private partnerships and targeted R&D funding for low‑emission shipping, alternative fuels and circular economy practices.

Monitoring and evaluation (indicators relevant to strategy and security)
- Environmental: nutrient loads and eutrophication indices, hazardous substance levels, status of fisheries stocks, coastal habitat extent, biodiversity indicators.
- Climate/resilience: coastal flood risk exposure, number of resilient infrastructure projects, disaster response capacity metrics.
- Socio‑economic: employment in green sectors, skills/training metrics, regional GDP per capita, urban‑rural disparity indicators.
- Innovation/competitiveness: R&D investment/GDP, patenting in green technologies, transport connectivity indices.
- Security-relevant metrics: critical supply‑chain redundancy, resilience of strategic infrastructure, population displacement risk indices.

Financing and resource mobilisation
- International sources: multilateral development banks (World Bank, ADB, AIIB), New Development Bank, bilateral climate finance, and climate‑focused instruments under the Green Climate Fund.
- Domestic sources: national and state budget allocations for climate adaptation, defence and infrastructure financing redirected to resilience investments, and public procurement for green technologies.
- Private finance: blended finance vehicles, green bonds, and PPPs to incentivise investment in ports, shipping decarbonisation, and urban resilience.

Environmental and socio-economic challenges to address
- Environmental: eutrophication of coastal waters, hazardous pollution, biodiversity loss, overfishing, pollution from increasing maritime traffic, and climate-driven sea‑level and temperature changes.
- Socio‑economic: regional disparities (coastal‑inland, urban‑rural), labour market mismatches, demographic pressures, migration and the need for green and digital skills.

Policy coherence and institutional prerequisites
- Mainstreaming sustainability requires cross‑sector coordination mechanisms, stable legal frameworks, data standardisation and integrated planning at national, state and local levels.
- Defence and security establishments must be integrated as stakeholders — both as users of resilient infrastructure and as contributors to logistics and disaster response.

Technical and policy measures (examples and modalities)
- Low‑emission shipping: incentives for LNG/alternative fuels, shore‑power at ports, and designated clean‑shipping corridors in high‑traffic lanes.
- Ecosystem restoration: mangrove replanting, coastal habitat restoration and marine protected areas to enhance fisheries and shore protection.
- Nature‑based solutions for flood protection: restored wetlands and reefs used alongside engineered seawalls.
- Circular economy incentives: waste reduction at source, port reception facilities for ship waste, and industrial symbiosis clusters.
- Digital connectivity and transport: invest in resilient digital backbone and multimodal transport hubs to secure supply chains.

Engagement, communication and legitimacy
- Stakeholder engagement (local communities, fisher associations, ports, industry and NGOs) is essential to ensure policies are practicable and socially legitimate.
- Transparent reporting and public communication build social cohesion and political support for long‑term investments that may be disruptive in the short term.

Risks and barriers
- Financial constraints, fragmented governance, poor data and monitoring, slow technological uptake, and the tension between short‑term economic priorities and long‑term sustainability.
- Geopolitical competition that could politicise cooperative environmental initiatives if not carefully framed as mutual benefit public goods.

Recommended next steps for India (operationalising the Baltic lessons)
1. Define measurable targets and timelines across security‑relevant objectives (e.g., emissions pathways for ports and shipping, coastal biodiversity recovery milestones, resilience thresholds for critical infrastructure).
2. Establish a monitoring framework with agreed indicators and regular reporting — combine scientific monitoring (oceanographic and ecological) with socio‑economic and resilience metrics.
3. Map and engage stakeholders across central, state and local levels; create coordination mechanisms that include defence, environment, transport, fisheries and finance ministries.
4. Prioritise funding pipelines that mobilise public and private finance for green infrastructure, innovation and adaptation (use blended finance to leverage private capital).
5. Launch flagship cross‑border pilot projects that demonstrate scalable solutions (clean shipping corridors in the Indian Ocean, nutrient reduction programmes for shared deltas, green industrial clusters at port cities).
6. Invest in capacity building and workforce development for green and resilient jobs — technical training for ship crews, port workers, coastal managers and first responders.
7. Institutionalise regional cooperation forums with dedicated scientific secretariats to depoliticise technical work and sustain long‑term collaboration.

Concluding analytical note
- The Baltic Sea model reframes regional governance as an exercise in risk reduction, resilience-building and mutual economic benefit. For India, embedding similar objectives within national security policy signals an evolution of strategic culture — from a narrow focus on military deterrence to a broader understanding of security that includes ecological stability, economic resilience and social cohesion.
- This integrated approach reduces the likelihood that environmental degradation becomes a source of instability and increases India’s capacity to project influence through provision of regional public goods — a contemporary dimension of strategic credibility in the Indo‑Pacific.

## Macro‑regional Societal Security: The Baltic Sea Region Model and Lessons for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

This section examines a macro‑regional approach to societal security as exemplified by the Baltic Sea Region (BSR) initiative and draws practical lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy. The BSR objective—to enhance societal security and safety through preparedness and cooperation—maps directly onto contemporary Indian challenges: transnational trafficking, protection of children, disaster risk in a changing climate, and the need for rapid cross‑jurisdictional response. The analysis below synthesises the BSR goals, operational methods, legal frameworks and risks, and translates them into policy-relevant guidance for India.

### Core purpose and objectives

At its heart, the BSR approach seeks to protect people by increasing resilience to violence, accidents and emergencies through preparedness and cooperation. Four interlocking objectives are central:

- Counteract all forms of trafficking in human beings through prevention and protection.
  - Methodology: coherent, multidisciplinary anti‑trafficking work spanning prevention, victim protection, prosecution and partnership with civil society.
- Promote comprehensive and sustainable child protection to prevent and respond to violence against children.
  - Methodology: multi‑sectoral approaches that increase cooperation among authorities, social services, schools and NGOs.
- Strengthen societal resilience to disasters and hazards across the crisis lifecycle (prevention, preparedness, response, recovery).
- Enhance interoperability and strategic macro‑regional cooperation for assistance and rapid response to cross‑border accidents and emergencies, including those with transboundary effects.

These objectives are complementary: anti‑trafficking and child protection are part of a human‑security focus, while resilience and interoperability enable states and sub‑national actors to manage physical risks that often have social and criminal dimensions.

### Key stakeholders and institutional architecture

A successful macro‑regional societal security posture depends on an inclusive stakeholder set:

- National governments (central ministries responsible for internal affairs, home affairs, justice, health, social welfare, disaster management)
- Sub‑national authorities (states/provinces, municipal bodies)
- Emergency services (police, fire, medical, disaster response units)
- Law enforcement and judicial actors (specialised units for trafficking, prosecutors)
- Child protection agencies and social services
- NGOs and civil society (prevention, victim support, awareness)
- International organisations and regional secretariats (for BSR: CBSS; for India: SAARC/BIMSTEC/UN agencies as relevant)
- Private sector and community actors (transport, telecoms, schools)

In India’s context, alignment between bodies like the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), National Investigation Agency (NIA), National Human Rights institutions, State Disaster Response Forces (SDRF), and civil society is essential.

### Operational measures and modalities

Operationalising the above requires a mix of planning, capability development and legal cooperation:

- Joint preparedness planning and shared contingency plans across jurisdictions.
- Common protocols and harmonised standard operating procedures (SOPs) for cross‑border and inter‑state incidents.
- Regular cross‑border and inter‑state exercises to test rapid deployment, logistics and command relationships.
- Information and data‑sharing arrangements, including shared situational awareness platforms and secure hotlines.
- Rapid deployment mechanisms and mutual aid agreements for movement of personnel, equipment and victims.
- Capacity building: training first responders, judicial actors, social workers and educators in trauma‑informed and victim‑centred practices.

For India, these modalities can be implemented through inter‑ministerial working groups, state‑center protocols, and institutionalised exercises involving NDRF, SDRFs, police and health services.

### Anti‑trafficking specifics

A comprehensive anti‑trafficking strategy combines prevention, protection, prosecution and partnerships:

- Prevention: public awareness campaigns, education and livelihood alternatives in vulnerable communities, targeted interventions for migration corridors.
- Protection: proactive victim identification, immediate medical and psychosocial support, safe housing and long‑term reintegration services.
- Prosecution: specialised investigative units, judicial cooperation across jurisdictions, witness protection and expedited case handling.
- Partnerships: formal mechanisms for NGOs, faith organisations and community groups to participate in prevention and aftercare.

India should consider mapping high‑risk corridors, strengthening anti‑trafficking units in border states, and integrating socio‑economic prevention measures in development policy.

### Child protection specifics

Effective child protection in a macro‑regional frame entails:

- Harmonised reporting systems and referral mechanisms across agencies and borders.
- Multi‑disciplinary child protection teams combining law enforcement, social workers, health professionals and education officials.
- Systematic training for frontline professionals in detection, reporting, and trauma‑informed interventions.
- Prevention programs in schools and communities, and accessible recovery services (psychosocial care, legal aid).

India’s statutory framework (for example, POCSO and child welfare committees) provides a foundation; harmonisation of procedures and enhanced inter‑state cooperation will strengthen protective outcomes.

### Interoperability and the resilience lifecycle

Interoperability across agencies and borders requires technical, procedural and organisational alignment:

- Compatible communications systems and interoperable equipment standards.
- Standardised incident command systems (ICS) adapted to national federal structures.
- Mutual aid agreements, shared logistics and pre‑positioned stockpiles.
- Shared situational awareness platforms for common operating pictures during crises.

Resilience investments must span the lifecycle:
- Mitigation: risk reduction through infrastructure, land‑use planning and social policies.
- Preparedness: contingency planning, stockpiles, drills and training.
- Response: rapid deployment, casualty management, coordination of relief.
- Recovery: reconstruction incorporating resilience and psychosocial support to communities.

India can leverage existing institutions (NDMA, NDRF) while enhancing interoperability at state and municipal levels, and between civilian and security agencies.

### Legal and normative alignment

Macro‑regional efforts should align with international and national legal frameworks:

- International frameworks: UN Palermo Protocol (Trafficking in Persons), UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and relevant UN Guiding Principles on internal displacement and disaster response norms.
- Regional norms: for the BSR, EU directives frame victims’ rights and anti‑trafficking obligations; for India, alignment with international norms remains important even if regional directives differ.
- National law: India’s criminal statutes, POCSO, trafficking laws and disaster management legislation must be harmonised with cooperative protocols to enable cross‑jurisdictional action while safeguarding rights and data protection.

Respecting data protection and human rights in cross‑border information sharing is crucial to maintain legitimacy and protect victims.

### Cross‑border and coordination challenges

Macro‑regional cooperation faces persistent obstacles:

- Differing legal regimes and evidentiary standards complicate joint investigations and prosecutions.
- Language and cultural barriers hinder communication and victim support.
- Uneven resource capacities among jurisdictions produce gaps in response.
- Jurisdictional complexity, especially where state and national competencies overlap, delays rapid action.
- Data protection and privacy rules constrain information exchange unless robust protocols exist.

Mitigating these challenges requires legal harmonisation, translation/liaison services, capacity building in weaker jurisdictions and pre‑agreed data‑sharing protocols.

### Performance indicators and monitoring

To assess progress, adopt measurable indicators across domains:

- Anti‑trafficking: reductions in detected trafficking incidence, number of victims identified and supported, conviction rates for traffickers.
- Child protection: reported incidents, time to interventions, number of trained multidisciplinary teams, school‑based prevention reach.
- Disaster resilience: response times, frequency and outcomes of joint exercises, stockpile availability, recovery timeframes.
- Interoperability and cooperation: number of mutual aid agreements, adoption of joint protocols, functional information‑sharing platforms, stakeholder cooperation metrics.

Indicators should be realistic, comparable across jurisdictions, and tied to periodic independent evaluation.

### Funding and resource modalities

Sustainable funding requires a mix of sources:

- National and sub‑national budgets (core funding for response capacities and social protection).
- Multilateral and bilateral assistance (UN agencies, donor partners).
- Regional funding instruments where applicable (EU models suggest pooled mechanisms; India can explore bilateral or multilateral funding windows).
- Project financing through international donors and public–private partnerships for specific capabilities or pilot projects.

In India, finance should prioritise community‑level prevention, victim services and interoperable platforms that yield durable cross‑state benefits.

### Risks and undermining factors

Key risk drivers that can weaken implementation include:

- Adaptive organised crime networks shifting routes and modalities.
- Migration pressures and demographic changes creating new vulnerabilities.
- Climate change intensifying frequency and scale of disasters.
- Socio‑economic inequalities that increase vulnerability to trafficking and disaster impacts.
- Limited political will or short funding cycles that prevent long‑term capacity building.

Mitigation requires flexible strategies, sustained political commitment and continuous threat analysis.

### Strategic benefits for India’s strategic culture

Adopting a macro‑regional, cooperative societal security posture has strategic implications for India’s security culture:

- It reinforces a human‑security orientation within national strategy—emphasising protection of persons, not just territory.
- It builds norms of cooperative security and interdependence that can reduce duplication and increase efficiency.
- It strengthens crisis diplomacy capacities and enhances India’s ability to deliver rapid assistance, improving regional influence and stability.
- It fosters whole‑of‑society resilience, integrating civil, private and community actors into national security practice.

These changes complement conventional defence‑centric thinking, advancing a more holistic, multi‑domain strategic culture.

### Recommended next steps for Indian policymakers

To translate the BSR model into actionable Indian policy, consider the following sequence:

1. Map existing capacities: conduct a comprehensive mapping of national, state and municipal resources, legal frameworks, NGOs and private actors relevant to trafficking, child protection and disaster response.
2. Set measurable targets: adopt SMART targets for key indicators (victim support numbers, response times, joint exercise frequency).
3. Establish inter‑agency working groups: create dedicated working groups for anti‑trafficking, child protection and disaster interoperability with representation from central ministries, states and civil society.
4. Pilot interoperability exercises: run cross‑state and (where applicable) cross‑border pilot exercises to test mutual aid arrangements, communications systems and command structures.
5. Harmonise protocols and data‑sharing: develop SOP templates, data‑sharing agreements and victim protection protocols that reconcile privacy and investigative needs.
6. Invest in capacity building: scale training for frontline responders, judicial actors and social services; prioritise trauma‑informed, victim‑centred care.
7. Secure blended funding: combine national budget allocations, bilateral/multilateral grants and targeted donor projects to finance pilots and scale‑up.
8. Monitor and evaluate: establish independent monitoring and periodic reviews tied to performance indicators and public reporting.

Conclusion

The Baltic Sea Region’s macro‑regional approach to societal security demonstrates how coordinated prevention, protection and resilience work can mitigate cross‑border and transnational threats. For India, adapting these lessons means institutionalising multi‑sectoral cooperation, investing in interoperable capacities across federal lines, prioritising victim‑centred practices, and aligning legal and operational frameworks with international norms. Doing so would reorient Indian strategic culture toward a resilient, cooperative model of national security that protects people as a central national objective.
