# Intergovernmental organization

## The International Organization for Migration (IOM) — overview
The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is an intergovernmental organization dedicated to the study and management of human migration. Founded in 1951 (initially as the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration), IOM has evolved into the leading international body focused on migration policy and operational assistance. It performs a primarily operational role, implementing on-the-ground programmes that respond to the practical needs of migrants and the states and communities that host them.

## Legal and institutional relationship with the United Nations
IOM is a part of the broader United Nations system as a "UN-related organization" rather than being one of the UN’s specialized agencies. In 2016 IOM formally became part of the UN system through agreement with member states and UN bodies, enabling closer strategic and operational cooperation with UN agencies and programmes while preserving its separate intergovernmental governance structure. The distinction matters in legal and budgetary terms: IOM retains its own membership, governing bodies and largely voluntary funding model, and it is not funded through UN assessed contributions in the same way as specialised agencies.

## Mandate, core activities and operational role
IOM’s mandate centers on migration management across the full spectrum of migration-related needs. Typical activities include:
- Emergency response and humanitarian assistance for displaced populations.
- Voluntary return and reintegration programmes for migrants wishing or needing to return to countries of origin.
- Resettlement support, including safe and dignified movement of refugees and vulnerable migrants.
- Capacity‑building and technical assistance to states on border management, migration governance and labour migration policies.
- Data collection, analysis and information systems (e.g., displacement tracking tools) to inform policy and operational planning.
- Policy advice and normative work on migration governance, rights of migrants and related law and standards.

IOM is best understood as an operational partner: it implements programmes directly, often in complex and crisis-affected environments, and supports states in building the institutional capacity to manage migration.

## Populations served
IOM’s programmes target a broad set of migrants and civilians affected by displacement, including but not limited to:
- Internally displaced persons (IDPs)
- Refugees and asylum seekers (often in partnership with UNHCR)
- Migrant workers (documented and undocumented)
- Returnees and deportees
- Stateless persons and other vulnerable groups affected by migration crises

## History and headquarters
- Founded: 1951 (as a committee responding to post‑war migration flows in Europe).
- Headquarters: Geneva, Switzerland — a strategic location among a dense cluster of international organisations and diplomatic missions.

## Governance and funding
- Governance: Member states participate through an IOM Council and other governance organs that set policy and programme priorities. IOM’s decision-making reflects the intergovernmental nature of the organization.
- Funding: Primarily voluntary and project-based contributions from member states and partners. The heavy reliance on earmarked voluntary funding shapes programme choices and operational flexibility: donors often fund specific projects, which can limit predictable core financing for institutional priorities.

## Partnerships and modalities of cooperation
IOM routinely partners with UN agencies (notably UNHCR, UNDP, WHO), national governments, international financial institutions, non-governmental organizations and private-sector actors. These partnerships enable a mix of policy coherence, pooled operational capacity and access to specialized expertise. Coordinated responses—particularly in humanitarian emergencies and mixed migration contexts—are a practical hallmark of IOM’s work.

## Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
For India, an understanding of IOM matters both practically and conceptually:
- Labour migration and diasporic linkages have direct economic and soft‑power effects on India’s external relations and domestic economy.
- Cross-border displacement, irregular migration and the return of nationals can have security implications, from border management and human trafficking to public order and community resilience.
- IOM’s technical assistance and operational capacity offer India options for cooperation in the region (e.g., capacity building, disaster displacement response, counter‑trafficking).
Accordingly, engagement with IOM intersects with India’s strategic objectives in migration governance, humanitarian diplomacy and regional stability.

## Inconsistencies and points to verify
- Terminology: The text sometimes uses "United Nations related organization" and elsewhere "UN agency." For precision, the correct description is that IOM is a UN‑related organization within the UN system, not a UN specialized agency.
- Leadership: The outline names a Director General (Amy E. Pope). Leadership of international organizations changes; for operational or citation use this should be verified against IOM’s official website or the most recent UN documentation.

## Recommendation
When citing IOM in scholarly or policy work, confirm the current Director General and any evolving legal or institutional arrangements by consulting primary sources (IOM official website, relevant UN General Assembly and CEB/UN system documents). This ensures factual accuracy on personnel, status and recent institutional developments.

## The International Organization for Migration: From European Logistics Agency to Global Migration Governance — Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Background and founding purpose
- The International Organization for Migration (IOM) traces its origins to the immediate post‑World War II period. Created in 1951 to address the vast movements of people — internally displaced persons and war refugees — in post‑war Europe, the organization was born of an urgent operational need: to organize, coordinate and deliver large‑scale migrant transport and resettlement.
- In its earliest incarnation the body functioned explicitly as a logistics agency. During the 1950s it organized transport for nearly one million migrants, an early demonstration of substantial operational capacity and of an institutional identity grounded in field operations rather than in normative or policy formation.

Institutional evolution captured in name changes
- The IOM’s institutional trajectory is usefully read through its successive names, each marking a stage in mandate, scope and self‑conception:
  - 1951 — Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from Europe (PICMME): an ad hoc, provisional body created to meet an acute European crisis.
  - 1952 — Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEM): a transition to a more established, regionally focused mandate.
  - 1980 — Intergovernmental Committee for Migration (ICM): removal of “European” signalled a widening geographic remit and a move away from an exclusively European problem set.
  - 1989 — International Organization for Migration (IOM): adoption of a universal descriptor reflected the organization’s evolution into a global, permanent intergovernmental entity concerned with migration in its multiple dimensions.
- These name changes should be seen as institutional evolution rather than replacement: the organization retained institutional memory, operational networks, and capacities accrued in its European phase, which eased subsequent global expansion.

Functional shift: from transport logistics to comprehensive migration management
- The 1950s emphasis on transport logistics illustrates the IOM’s origins in operational delivery. Over subsequent decades, however, the organization broadened both its activities and its modes of engagement:
  - Humanitarian assistance for displaced populations and forced migrants.
  - Migration management and border‑related capacity building.
  - Policy support, research and technical assistance for governments.
  - Reintegration and resettlement programmes, labour migration facilitation, and counter‑trafficking initiatives.
- This functional broadening transformed the IOM from an implementer of movement to a key practitioner and intermediary in global migration governance.

Integration with the multilateral system
- A critical institutional milestone came with the IOM’s deepening relationship with the United Nations system. Its formal association as a related organization in 2016 strengthened its multilateral legitimacy and created new channels for cooperation on global migration policy, humanitarian response and development‑migration linkages.

Analytical implications: governance, membership and mandates
- To understand the IOM’s priorities and operational choices, scholars and policymakers should examine the founding instruments, subsequent constitutional changes, and the composition of member states at each stage. These reveal how governance structures, funding modalities, and political coalitions shaped the organization’s agenda.
- The IOM’s European origins endowed it with robust operational networks and institutional expertise that became vectors for global expansion; this path dependency matters when assessing the organization’s strengths and limits.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Migration sits at the intersection of domestic politics, economic policy and national security. The IOM’s evolution from a logistics operator to a global migration governance actor has several implications for Indian strategic thinking:
  - Diaspora and labour mobility: India’s large migrant labour population and global diaspora create national interests in consular protection, labour rights, remittance systems and skills mobility — all areas where IOM’s operational experience and technical assistance can be leveraged.
  - Border and migratory security: IOM programmes on border management, counter‑trafficking and migration data systems bear directly on India’s concerns with irregular migration, trafficking networks and cross‑border displacement.
  - Humanitarian and crisis response: The IOM’s operational capacities for displacement management complement India’s growing role in humanitarian assistance and disaster diplomacy, providing avenues for cooperation in the region (e.g., South Asia, Indian Ocean).
  - Policy capacity and multilateral engagement: The IOM’s integration with the UN system and its policy research can inform Indian policy formulation on migration governance, bilateral labour agreements and regional migration frameworks.
  - Strategic signalling: Engagement with IOM—technical cooperation, leadership roles, or funding partnerships—can serve India’s strategic aim to shape migration norms and extend its soft‑power footprint in neighbouring states.
- For policymakers, tracing the IOM’s institutional evolution provides practical lessons: the organization’s capacity to pivot from regional logistics to global policy actor demonstrates how operational expertise can be parlayed into governance influence — a model India may find instructive in shaping its own multilateral engagements.

Concluding note
- The IOM’s history encapsulates a broader pattern in international organization development: crisis‑driven origins that institutionalize into enduring bureaucracies capable of expanding mandates and influence. For Indian strategic culture and national security policy, the IOM offers both practical instruments (operational cooperation, capacity building, humanitarian partnership) and analytical lessons about how institutional pedigrees, mandate evolution and multilateral integration shape the governance of transnational challenges such as migration. Scholars and practitioners should pair institutional history (founding agreements, membership shifts) with contemporary programme analysis to craft policies that exploit opportunities while managing the security and governance risks posed by migration.

### IOM, UN Affiliation, and the Global Migration Governance Architecture: Implications for India's Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Background and key milestones
- 1992 — The International Organization for Migration (IOM) was granted observer status at the United Nations General Assembly (GA resolution A/RES/47/4). This marked formal UN engagement with IOM but left IOM institutionally separate from the UN system.
- September 2016 — UN Member States unanimously approved an agreement to transform IOM into an affiliated organization of the UN. The agreement deepened the institutional relationship and aligned IOM more closely with UN policies and coordination mechanisms.
- December 2018 — The Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), the first intergovernmental framework on international migration, was adopted in Marrakech. The GCM is a politically significant, yet non‑binding, cooperative framework.
- 2019 — The UN Secretary‑General established the UN Network on Migration to support implementation, follow‑up and review of the GCM. IOM coordinates the Network, which brings together UN agencies (including UNHCR, WFP, UNDP and others) to reduce duplication and align UN assistance on migration.

Institutional significance of affiliation
- Observer status (1992) signalled formal engagement but limited integration; affiliation (2016) implies a deeper policy and operational alignment with UN systems, access to UN coordination mechanisms, and greater expectations for accountability and standardization.
- Affiliation expanded IOM’s normative influence: as Network coordinator, IOM now helps shape how UN agencies advise states and design joint programmes on migration governance.
- The tradeoffs are tangible: improved legitimacy, access to pooled funds and data‑sharing, and stronger interagency cooperation come with closer alignment to UN norms, reporting requirements and programmatic oversight.

Operational footprint and credibility
- Over five decades IOM’s operations have tracked major man‑made and natural crises — examples include Kosovo and East Timor (1999), the 2004 Asian tsunami, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the 2004–05 Pakistan earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the European migration crisis (mid‑2010s).
- IOM has evolved from ad‑hoc migration assistance to large‑scale integrated humanitarian and development responses: emergency response, displacement management, assisted returns and reintegration, and data collection (e.g., displacement tracking).
- This operational record underpins the organisation’s guiding credo — “humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society” — a formulation increasingly accepted by states and reflected in policy dialogues.

Global Compact for Migration and UN Network on Migration
- The GCM offers a cooperative, non‑binding framework for states to cooperate on migration management; it does not create new legal obligations but provides common objectives, guidelines and best practices.
- The UN Network on Migration is a system‑wide coordination platform designed to harmonize UN support to governments, avoid duplication, and combine technical capacities across the UN system.
- IOM’s coordination role within the Network increases its capacity to translate governance frameworks (like the GCM) into operational assistance, normative guidance and capacity‑building at national level.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Migration as a governed policy field: The GCM and IOM’s evolving role contribute to a global shift treating migration as a manageable, multi‑dimensional policy area — not solely a security or border problem. For India, this offers frameworks and technical assistance for labour migration, diaspora engagement, consular protection, and disaster‑related displacement.
- Sovereignty and differentiated state interests: India’s strategic culture places high value on sovereignty and selective multilateralism. The non‑binding nature of the GCM and the voluntariness of UN Network support make engagement compatible with India’s preference for preserving policy autonomy while accessing technical cooperation.
- Operational cooperation and emergency response: IOM’s experience in displacement management and reintegration could augment India’s responses to large displacement events (natural disasters, cross‑border crises), particularly through data systems, beneficiary tracking and reintegration programming.
- Data governance and protection: As IOM deepens data collection and displacement tracking, India must weigh benefits of improved situational awareness against concerns about data sovereignty, privacy, and the protection of vulnerable migrants.
- Normative alignment and domestic obligations: Greater UN alignment raises expectations regarding human rights, protection standards and reporting. India will need to balance international normative pressures with domestic political sensitivities around irregular migration and border management.

Key implications (summary)
- IOM’s UN affiliation and Network coordination place it centrally in shaping state practice and policy on migration.
- The GCM and the UN Network provide frameworks for collective action but depend on voluntary state commitments for implementation.
- IOM’s operational footprint strengthens its credibility to lead both emergency responses and cross‑agency policy coordination.
- Stronger UN integration brings resources and legitimacy as well as obligations to align with UN norms, reporting and oversight.

Recommended points of attention for policy and scholarship
- Monitor how Member States implement GCM commitments and the role IOM plays in national capacity‑building, especially in South Asia.
- Track changes to IOM’s funding structure, oversight mechanisms and partnerships with other UN agencies, as these affect project modalities available to India.
- Assess the governance of migration data collected or coordinated by IOM: standards for confidentiality, data sovereignty, and interoperability with national systems.
- Evaluate the UN Network on Migration’s coordination outcomes in specific contexts (e.g., regional displacement in the Indian Ocean, labour migration to and from India, and responses to large‑scale disasters).
- Research how increasing international acceptance of the “humane and orderly” credo influences India’s domestic policy framing of migration (labour, refugee protection, internal displacement).

Concluding note
For India’s strategic culture, the evolution of IOM from UN observer to an affiliated and coordinating actor represents both pragmatic opportunities and normative challenges. It opens avenues for technical cooperation, coordinated crisis response and improved migration governance, while also requiring careful navigation of sovereignty concerns, data protection, and domestic political legitimacy. Policymakers and scholars should watch how voluntary frameworks like the GCM translate into concrete national practice and how IOM’s procedural integration with the UN shapes migration governance in South Asia and beyond.

### Organization

This section examines the organisational architecture of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) — its physical presence, human resources, governance, languages and financing — and draws out the practical implications for states, with attention to relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policymaking.

Summary
- IOM’s headquarters are in Geneva, with liaison offices in New York City and Addis Ababa and a specialised research hub, the Global Migration Data Analysis Centre (GMDAC), in Berlin.  
- In 2020 IOM reported roughly 15,311 staff drawn from 168 nationalities.  
- Its supreme governing body is the Council, composed of all member states, operating under formal rules of procedure and regular meetings that set budgetary and programme priorities.  
- Official languages are English, French and Spanish.  
- The 2020 budget was about USD 2 billion, largely composed of voluntary contributions and donations.  
- IOM became a related organisation of the United Nations system in 2016, which shapes its coordination with UN agencies and multilateral fora.

1. Physical presence and strategic placement
- Geneva headquarters: Locating the Secretariat in Geneva places IOM at the heart of the international institutional ecosystem. Geneva’s concentration of UN agencies, international financial institutions and NGOs facilitates daily inter-agency coordination and policy dialogue — an important advantage for rapid operational harmonisation in crises and for the organisation’s normative work on migration governance.
- Liaison offices in New York and Addis Ababa: The New York office enables sustained engagement with the UN General Assembly, ECOSOC processes and Security Council dynamics when migration intersects peace and security issues. The Addis Ababa presence supports relations with the African Union and regional partners, crucial given intra‑African and intercontinental migration flows. For states such as India, these nodes are focal points for diplomatic interaction, coalition-building and multilateral advocacy on migration issues.
- GMDAC in Berlin: The Global Migration Data Analysis Centre provides rigorous, evidence‑based analysis to underpin policy and programming. Its existence signals IOM’s dual operational–analytic mandate: moving migrants and shaping the knowledge base policymakers use. For national security planners, GMDAC outputs help quantify flows, vulnerabilities and trends that may have strategic significance.

2. Human resources, diversity and operational footprint
- Scale and composition: The reported 2020 figure of ~15,311 staff, representing 168 nationalities, indicates a very large operational footprint. Such scale implies complex logistics, human resources systems, security arrangements and field support infrastructures to sustain global operations.
- Significance of diversity: Wide nationality representation enhances cultural competence and local knowledge, improving field effectiveness and legitimacy in diverse operating environments. For national governments, partnering with an organisation that draws staff from many countries can facilitate access to local expertise and localized program delivery.
- Practical implications: Large staff complement and global presence enable IOM to respond rapidly to emergencies (disasters, refugee movements, evacuations) — capabilities that national security establishments routinely leverage or coordinate with in crises involving citizens abroad, cross‑border displacement or humanitarian contingencies.

3. Governance and decision‑making
- The Council: IOM’s highest decision‑making organ is the Council, in which all member states are represented. It operates under written rules of procedure and convenes at regular intervals to adopt the organisation’s programmematic objectives and budget.
- Member-driven governance: Universal representation produces legitimacy but also necessitates negotiation and compromise. Budget and priority setting are subject to political bargaining among diverse members; consensus or broad agreement is often required for major initiatives. This dynamic means that IOM’s strategic orientation can reflect prevailing donor and member preferences.
- For national security policy: States must therefore engage diplomatically within IOM’s governance fora to shape priorities (e.g., migration management, counter‑trafficking, assisted returns) that intersect with their security interests.

4. Language, communication and operational reach
- Official languages: English, French and Spanish are IOM’s formal working languages, reflecting its global remit and facilitating access across many regions.
- Operational multilingualism: In practice, IOM regularly uses additional UN and local languages in field operations and consular‑style assistance. For India — a multilingual state with significant diaspora and migrant labour linkages — this linguistic flexibility eases cooperation on citizen assistance, labour migration programmes and communication with diverse migrant communities.

5. Financing: scale, composition and constraints
- Budget profile: IOM’s 2020 budget was approximately USD 2 billion. The bulk of resources are voluntary contributions and earmarked donations rather than assessed, predictable funding.
- Consequences of voluntary funding: Reliance on voluntary contributions produces flexibility and programme diversity but also funding unpredictability and incentives for donor earmarking. This can fragment planning, constrain long‑term capacity building and bias programming toward donor priorities rather than holistic migration governance.
- Strategic implications: For national security planners, the funding model means that partnering with IOM can be efficient for crisis response or targeted projects, but less reliable for sustained capacity building unless accompanied by predictable financing arrangements or pooled funds.

6. IOM within the UN system (since 2016)
- Related organisation status: IOM’s formal association with the UN system in 2016 strengthened institutional linkages and improved coherence in areas where migration intersects humanitarian, development and peace agendas.
- Coordination benefits: The status facilitates joint programming, information‑sharing and common policy positions — useful in multisectoral responses (e.g., health, humanitarian protection, border management) that have security implications for sending, transit and receiving states.

Analytical implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Diplomatic leverage and multilateral engagement: IOM’s governance architecture and liaison presence provide platforms for India to advance migration‑related priorities — protection of overseas nationals, regulation of labour migration, counter‑trafficking and diaspora engagement — within a multilateral setting.
- Evidence and policy design: GMDAC’s data services can inform India’s risk assessments related to migration‑linked vulnerabilities (labour flows, irregular migration, climate displacement) and support policy calibration across domestic security and foreign policy domains.
- Operational partnerships: IOM’s large staff and global presence make it a practical operational partner in evacuations, humanitarian assistance and capacity building at borders and consular services — areas that intersect with national security responsibilities.
- Caution on dependencies: The organisation’s voluntary funding model and member‑driven priority setting mean that India should pursue targeted, strategic partnerships (including predictable funding where needed) to ensure continuity in areas of national interest and avoid overreliance on donor‑driven project cycles.

Conclusion
The organisational design of IOM — its geographic nodes, large and diverse workforce, member‑state governance, multilingual operations and voluntary financing — shapes both its comparative advantages and its constraints as a partner for states. For India, understanding these organisational features is essential to shaping an engagement strategy that leverages IOM’s operational reach and analytic capacity while managing the political and financial dynamics that influence what the organisation can sustainably deliver.

## Director General — International Organization for Migration

Role and selection
- The Director General (DG) of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) is the organization’s chief executive and is elected by delegates of IOM member states. The election is conducted through the IOM’s governing machinery (the membership represented in bodies such as the Council and/or the Assembly), reflecting the intergovernmental character of the organization and the central role of member states in constituting senior management.
- That the DG is chosen by member-state delegates has practical and normative consequences: the holder must maintain the confidence of a diverse membership, navigate competing political priorities, and translate multilateral mandates into operational policy. For analysts of national security and strategic culture, the selection mechanism underscores how states shape institutional leadership to protect or promote their migration-related interests.

Term length and renewability
- The Director General’s statutory term is five years. In line with practice in many international organizations, five-year mandates strike a balance between continuity of leadership for programmatic stability and periodic political accountability to the membership.
- Five-year terms are frequently renewable; whether and how reappointment occurs (limits on number of terms, required majorities, or endorsement processes) depends on the IOM statutes and standing rules. For precise information on reappointment procedures, the IOM Constitution and Council/Assembly rules should be consulted.

Institutional history and transparency
- Institutional records commonly provide a list of previous Directors General and the heads of predecessor bodies. For IOM, this record typically includes leaders of the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEM), IOM’s predecessor. Such lists serve multiple purposes: they document institutional memory, allow researchers to trace policy and administrative evolution, and contribute to transparency and accountability in governance.
- A tabulated list of past directors (not reproduced here) is a standard archival and governance practice; it is a useful resource when assessing institutional change, leadership patterns (regional origin, background, tenure), and the evolution of organizational priorities.

Current incumbency and leadership diversity
- As of the present account in this chapter, the Director General is Amy Pope (United States of America). The named Deputy Director(s) General includes Ugochi Daniels (Nigeria).
- The pairing of a Director General from the United States and a Deputy from Nigeria is indicative of geographic and — potentially — professional diversity in senior leadership. Such cross‑regional representation can be important for the IOM’s legitimacy and operational reach, signalling sensitivity to both donor and migration-affected states. For national-security analysts, leadership composition can be an informative indicator of which member-state coalitions and regional perspectives exercise influence within the organization.

Procedural and textual caveats
- The source text uses the plural “Deputy Directors General” while naming a single individual; this could reflect one of three possibilities: the IOM has multiple deputy posts but only one is named in the source, a grammatical inconsistency, or a recent organizational restructuring. Where precise institutional form matters (for example, to map decision‑making lines or delegation of authority), consult the IOM’s official organisational chart and recent press releases.
- For authoritative verification of procedural rules (exact election procedure, required voting majorities, candidacy and nomination rules), the full roster of past directors, and the current list of deputies, the primary references are the IOM Constitution, Council/Assembly rules of procedure, official IOM press statements, and the IOM website.

Relevance to India’s strategic posture
- For a state like India, engagement with the IOM’s leadership matters for several reasons: access to senior officials can facilitate cooperation on migration management, diaspora engagement, counter‑trafficking, and humanitarian response; leadership composition may affect policy priorities and resource allocation; and the election process itself offers a forum for states to project influence and build coalitions. Understanding who leads the IOM, how they are chosen, and their regional provenance is therefore relevant to assessments of India’s migration diplomacy and wider national security considerations.

Further reading and primary sources
- To confirm specifics and access full documentary texts, consult the IOM Constitution and the organisation’s official website and press releases. These primary sources provide the definitive account of mandates, appointment procedures, and current incumbents.

## Chapter X — The International Organization for Migration: Mandate, Operations and Implications for Indian Strategic Policy

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) occupies a distinctive place in contemporary multilateral governance of migration. Founded to address the practical needs of population movement, it has evolved into a comprehensive operational actor across humanitarian, development and stabilization domains. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, understanding IOM’s mandate, operational strengths and limits, and its interaction with the wider UN system is essential: migration issues—cross‑border labour mobility, forced displacement, trafficking, and climate‑driven movement—now intersect directly with national resilience, border management and regional stability.

### Mandate and institutional character

- IOM’s mandate is explicitly global and broadly framed: it assists migrants in all categories, including migrant workers, refugees (in complementary roles), and internally displaced persons (IDPs). This breadth was designed to permit operational engagement across the full migration continuum—from labour migration management and assisted voluntary return to emergency displacement response and post‑crisis recovery.
- The organizational design trades narrow legal specificity for operational flexibility. The broad mandate is widely praised because it allows rapid, pragmatic responses in crises where needs cut across conventional legal categories. At the same time, that same breadth generates persistent critique: because IOM was not originally a UN agency and its mandate is not centred on protection law in the way the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was, questions remain about legal accountability and guarantees on protection standards in some contexts.

### Relationship with the UN system and UNHCR

- In recent years IOM became a related organization of the United Nations system, a formal change that strengthened institutional cooperation and expectations of interoperability with UN agencies. This status has practical effects: it increases pressure for coordinated planning, shared information systems and joint accountability mechanisms in humanitarian responses.
- IOM and UNHCR now maintain formal cooperation mechanisms to delineate complementary responsibilities. When mandates overlap—especially in mixed‑migration settings where refugees, asylum‑seekers and migrants are present together—these mechanisms are crucial to avoid duplication and gaps.
- At the operational level, the two agencies often cooperate closely. For example, at the direction of the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator (ERC), IOM and UNHCR share primary responsibility for camp coordination and camp management (CCCM) in humanitarian emergencies; IOM also frequently leads or co‑leads CCCM clusters. This technical role in CCCM is central to the well‑being of displaced populations and to coordination among humanitarian actors.

### Humanitarian and operational roles

- Within the UN humanitarian architecture, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) considers IOM a central humanitarian actor, particularly on displacement-related issues. IOM’s operational toolkit spans:
  - shelter and core relief items,
  - protection services and protection mainstreaming,
  - basic medical and sanitary care,
  - life‑safety interventions,
  - coordination functions (including CCCM),
  - telecommunications, information management and logistics support.
- Beyond immediate relief, IOM implements activities oriented to stabilization, peacebuilding and development that have migration‑related objectives: reintegration and recovery, livelihood support, community stabilization, migration governance and resilience building.

### Illustrative operational and diplomatic examples

- Regional response coordination: IOM coordinated a major regional response for the Venezuelan displacement situation through the Office of the IOM Director General’s Special Envoy for the Regional Response, working alongside UNHCR and 17 countries across South and Central America and the Caribbean. This demonstrates IOM’s capacity for cross‑border, multi‑state operational coordination.
- Emergency relief and IDPs: IOM delivered humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons in Port‑au‑Prince following a major earthquake, providing classic emergency services and CCCM technical support.
- Diplomatic visibility and partnerships: High‑level diplomacy sometimes accompanies operations—e.g., U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s participation in an IOM mission in Obock, Djibouti—underscoring how migration operations can become arenas of international political engagement.
- Large‑scale emergency responses: IOM has operated in rapid lifesaving evacuations, such as the tsunami response in Banda Aceh, Sumatra, illustrating its logistical and transportation capabilities in acute disasters.
- Recovery and reconstruction: In the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan, IOM supported recovery by repurposing uprooted trees in reconstruction—an example of linking humanitarian relief with practical, locally attuned recovery solutions.
- Refugee‑camp services: IOM has delivered medical care and education services in long‑term displacement settings such as Zaatari camp in Jordan, evidencing its role in protracted displacement contexts where humanitarian and development needs converge.

### Funding, accountability and critique

- Funding model: IOM’s financing is overwhelmingly voluntary and project‑based. This funding model confers operational flexibility—projects can be tailored to acute needs and donor preferences—but also produces unpredictability in resource availability and can skew programming toward donor priorities rather than long‑term strategic planning.
- Accountability and protection concerns: Because of its origin outside the UN system and the diffuse nature of its mandate, IOM faces ongoing scrutiny about legal mandates and protection accountability, particularly where protection obligations are contested or where host governments impose political constraints. Stakeholders continue to ask how protection is mainstreamed across its programmes and how legal responsibilities are clarified in mixed migration settings.
- Institutional overlap and political sensitivities: IOM regularly operates in spaces where mandates overlap with UNHCR, national governments and NGOs. Overlap can produce inefficiencies or gaps, and operations are often constrained by political sensitivities among host states—especially where migration is securitised.

### Common challenges and evaluative criteria

- Common operational challenges include: mandate overlap with other agencies; protection and legal clarity in mixed migration crises; political sensitivities in host states that limit access or constrain programming; and resource volatility due to voluntary funding.
- When evaluating IOM’s performance, stakeholders are advised to examine:
  - the extent and quality of protection mainstreaming in programmes;
  - the robustness of partnerships with UN entities, NGOs and host governments;
  - adherence to humanitarian principles, particularly neutrality and impartiality, when political pressures are intense;
  - the sustainability of interventions beyond immediate project cycles.

### Strategic implications for India

- Migration as a national security and resilience concern: For India, migration dynamics touch several strategic domains—labour migration to and from the Gulf and other regions, return and reintegration challenges for Indian nationals, internal displacement from natural disasters, cross‑border flows in neighbourhood crises, and irregular migration and trafficking. IOM’s technical tools—displacement coordination, reintegration programming, counter‑trafficking expertise and migration governance assistance—are directly relevant to India’s policy toolbox.
- Multilateral engagement and capacity building: India’s strategic culture, which emphasises strategic autonomy and normative pluralism in multilateral forums, can gain from selective engagement with IOM: partnering on capacity building for border and consular services, disaster displacement preparedness, and regional cooperation on labour migration governance.
- Operational cooperation in the region: Regional crises (e.g., population movements from neighbouring states, climate displacement in the Indian Ocean littoral) require coordinated responses. IOM’s practice of leading CCCM clusters, providing logistics and information management, and coordinating multi‑country responses offers a model India can plug into—both as a contributor of capacities and as a beneficiary.
- Policy considerations: Indian security and development planners should weigh the tradeoffs inherent in IOM’s model—operational speed and flexibility vs. resource unpredictability and questions of protection accountability. Strengthening domestic capabilities (early warning, disaster displacement strategies, consular protection) while engaging multilaterally with IOM can reduce strategic vulnerabilities arising from large, sudden migration flows.

Conclusion

IOM’s adaptive, operationally oriented model makes it a consequential actor for states confronting complex migration dynamics. For India, the organisation’s technical capacities and regional coordination functions are strategically useful, but engagement should be calibrated: India can benefit from leveraging IOM’s strengths in humanitarian response and migration governance while pressing for stronger protection safeguards, predictable financing mechanisms and clearer legal frameworks in mixed migration settings. Understanding the balance between IOM’s operational agility and its institutional limits is essential for integrating migration more coherently into India’s national security and strategic planning.

### Member states of the International Organization for Migration (IOM): a 2023 snapshot and its relevance for India

Summary — counts and format
- As of 2023 the IOM comprised 175 member states and 8 observer states (12 entities listed as non-members in the source list). The source material presents a nominal enumeration: a long list of members, a separate list of observers, and a short list of non-members. The list is descriptive rather than analytical — it records formal participation but does not explain accession histories, legal rights, or political motives.

Composition and geographic coverage
- The membership list is near-universal in geographic reach, including countries from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania, as well as numerous small island and microstates. Examples shown in the list:
  - Major powers: United States, China, Russian Federation, India, Japan, United Kingdom, France, Germany.
  - European states: Italy, Spain, Netherlands, Sweden, Poland (illustrating broad EU participation).
  - African States: Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Morocco.
  - Latin America and the Caribbean: Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala.
  - Asia–Pacific and small island states: Australia, New Zealand, Philippines, Nauru, Tuvalu, Palau, Marshall Islands.
  - The Holy See (Vatican) is included among members.
- Such breadth underscores IOM’s global remit: managing migration as a transnational phenomenon that touches states of origin, transit and destination.

Observer and non-member categories — who is where (per the 2023 list)
- Observers (8): Bahrain, Bhutan, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Qatar, San Marino, Saudi Arabia.
  - Observers are generally allowed to participate in proceedings but do not possess full voting rights in IOM governance organs.
- Non-members (12): Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Hong Kong (special administrative region), Iraq, Lebanon, Macau (special administrative region), North Korea, Oman, Singapore, Syria, Taiwan (territory with contested status), United Arab Emirates.
  - The list mixes UN members, de facto territories/special administrative regions, and states with varied political reasons for non-participation. Notably some Gulf states appear as either observers or non-members, indicating heterogeneous regional engagement with IOM.

Institutional and legal context (brief)
- The IOM entered the UN system in 2016 while retaining its own membership and governance arrangements. Member status confers full participation in governance (including voting at the Council); observer status typically confers the right to attend and speak but not vote. Non-members may nonetheless cooperate bilaterally with IOM on programs and projects without formal membership.
- The formal distinction matters: legal membership affects budgetary contributions, governance influence, programmatic priority-setting and the capacity to shape global migration norms.

Analytical observations and patterns worth noting
- Near-universal but incomplete buy-in: 175 members indicates widespread acceptance of IOM’s role but also highlights gaps — several states of strategic significance (e.g., some Gulf states, DPRK, Syria, Iraq) are non-members or observers.
- Regional politics and foreign policy strategy shape membership choices. For example:
  - Gulf patterns: the list shows a mix — Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait as observers; UAE, Oman and Bahrain differently placed — suggesting that wealthy migrant host states calibrate their engagement with IOM according to domestic labor-management strategies, regional diplomacy, and preferences for bilateral management of migration.
  - Special administrative regions and contested territories: places such as Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan appear separately from China on the non-member list, reflecting the complex intersections of sovereignty, international recognition and treaty practice.
- Small states and microstates are represented as members, reinforcing IOM’s operational focus on protecting vulnerable populations and states with high per-capita migration dynamics.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Migration as strategic terrain: For India, IOM membership is not merely bureaucratic. It intersects with several elements of strategic culture and national security policy:
  - Diaspora and remittances: Indian nationals abroad constitute one of the largest diasporas; engagement with IOM affects migrant welfare, return/reintegration programs, and mechanisms to protect remittances and migrant rights.
  - Labour migration governance: Many Indian migrants are concentrated in the Gulf and Southeast Asia, where the IOM’s programs on labour migration, pre-departure training, and protection from trafficking are operationally relevant.
  - Human security and humanitarian response: IOM’s rapid response capacities in displacement crises complement India’s own disaster diplomacy and consular mechanisms.
  - Strategic diplomacy: India’s participation allows it to shape global migration norms, use migration diplomacy in bilateral relations (notably with Gulf hosts), and leverage technical cooperation as an element of soft power.
  - Security concerns: Irregular migration, trafficking, and transnational criminal networks intersect with national security; engagement through multilateral fora like IOM offers tools for cooperative responses (information-sharing, capacity-building).
- Policy implications: India’s approach to IOM reflects a balance between protecting its migrant community, preserving strategic relations with migrant-hosting states (especially in the Gulf), and promoting international norms compatible with its developmental and security priorities.

Practical impacts of membership
- Access to services and funding: Membership affects access to IOM technical assistance, participation in program design, eligibility for certain funding mechanisms and influence over prioritization of international migration programming.
- Governance influence: Full members can vote at IOM governing bodies and thus influence budgetary allocations, normative instruments and the organization’s strategic direction.
- Bilateral cooperation remains viable: Non-members can still receive IOM assistance, but formal membership strengthens sustained policy engagement and governance leverage.

Caveats and recommendations for further research
- The list is a snapshot (2023); membership can change. Verify current membership against IOM official publications and the IOM website.
- Investigate regionally disaggregated counts: how many members per region and the share of UN member states represented, to quantify representation more precisely.
- Follow-up research questions:
  - Have any non-members in the 2023 list initiated accession processes since then?
  - What exact rights and privileges do observers exercise in the IOM’s governing instruments and practice?
  - Why do some wealthy Gulf states prefer observer status or remain non-members—are motivations administrative, political, or policy-driven (e.g., preference for bilateral arrangements)?
  - How has India leveraged IOM membership in its migration diplomacy, and where are the gaps between multilateral engagement and bilateral policy instruments (e.g., labour agreements, consular services, reintegration programs)?

Concluding note
- The 2023 membership snapshot demonstrates the IOM’s broad global reach and the political selectivity of a few states. For India, engagement with IOM is an instrument of both migrant protection and strategic diplomacy—an axis where human security and national security objectives intersect. Any policy or academic assessment should combine the nominal membership data with qualitative analysis of how membership translates into operational cooperation, normative influence, and strategic outcomes.

### Case study: IOM, the “Pacific Solution” and human-rights critiques (2003)

Summary
- In 2003 Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch (HRW) publicly criticized the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for its role in Australia’s “Pacific Solution,” the policy of transferring asylum seekers to offshore processing/detention centres.
- The specific facilities implicated were the Manus Regional Processing Centre in Papua New Guinea and the processing centre on Nauru.
- HRW’s principal contention was that IOM ran detention/processing centres without an explicit international refugee-protection mandate, and that its participation rendered the organization complicit in what HRW described as arbitrary detention.
- HRW further alleged that asylum seekers in those centres were denied access to legal advice, and urged IOM to cease operating the centres and to transfer responsibility to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
- Amnesty accused IOM of undertaking actions on behalf of states that adversely affected the human rights of asylum seekers, refugees and migrants; one cited example involved the reported removal of fourteen Kurds from Australian waters to Indonesia.
- Amnesty demanded assurances that IOM would respect the principle of non‑refoulement (the prohibition on returning individuals to places where they would face persecution or serious harm).
- Underlying these critiques was a deeper tension between IOM’s historically operational, state‑facing migration role and the normative expectations of international refugee and human‑rights protection bodies.
- Human rights NGOs called for either cessation of IOM’s detention‑related activities or their reallocation to an agency with an explicit protection mandate (UNHCR) and for stronger safeguards for asylum seekers.

Context and factual outline
In the early 2000s Australia implemented the “Pacific Solution,” transferring interdicted maritime asylum seekers to offshore facilities for processing. Manus (Papua New Guinea) and Nauru became emblematic sites. The IOM — an intergovernmental body long associated with operational migration assistance (transport, returns, reception) rather than refugee status determination and protection — accepted contracts from the Australian government to operate and manage aspects of these centres. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International challenged this arrangement in 2003, presenting factual allegations (denial of legal access; forced movements) and normative objections (complicity in arbitrary detention; potential breaches of non‑refoulement).

Legal and institutional fault lines
- Mandates: UNHCR has the explicit UN mandate for refugee protection, including obligations to identify refugees, advise on resettlement and advocate non‑refoulement. By contrast, IOM’s traditional remit was operational assistance to states on migration issues; until recent decades it did not possess an explicit UN refugee‑protection mandate. Human rights NGOs used this distinction to argue that detention and status‑determination activities belong under UNHCR or independent oversight, not under an operational agency beholden to state contracts.
- Non‑refoulement: The prohibition against returning a person to persecution is a cornerstone of refugee law (articulated in the 1951 Convention and subsequent practice) and of broader human‑rights protections. Amnesty’s demand for IOM assurances on non‑refoulement highlighted the risk that state‑commissioned operational activities could lead to returns contrary to this principle.
- Arbitrary detention and access to counsel: Allegations of arbitrary detention implicate treaty obligations under instruments such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and customary international law. HRW’s claim that detainees lacked access to legal advice intensified the urgency of these concerns, because effective legal counsel is a central procedural safeguard against arbitrary or unlawful detention and forced return.

Practical remedies proposed by NGOs
HRW and Amnesty proposed concrete institutional measures:
- Cease or transfer: They urged IOM to stop operating processing/detention centres and to transfer management to UNHCR or to independent bodies with explicit protection mandates.
- Oversight and monitoring: Where states externalize processing, NGOs called for independent monitoring, guaranteed legal access for detainees, and transparent procedures for status determination and appeals.
- Binding assurances: NGOs demanded that any operational role undertaken by IOM be accompanied by clear, public commitments to non‑refoulement and to adherence to international human‑rights norms.

Institutional and reputational consequences
Operating detention and processing facilities exposed IOM to reputational risk and pressured the organization to clarify its role and responsibilities. The episode illustrates how operational engagement with state migration policies — particularly those designed to deter or externalize asylum claims — can embroil service‑oriented agencies in contentious protection dilemmas. Such situations generate calls for clearer institutional boundaries, explicit mandates, and accountability mechanisms.

Contemporary relevance and lessons for strategic policy (implications for India)
Although this case concerns Australian policy and IOM, its lessons are salient for states and policymakers thinking about migration within strategic‑security frameworks:
- Operational efficiency vs. protection obligations: States and their partner agencies may be tempted to outsource difficult migration tasks for strategic or political reasons. However, outsourcing can create legal and moral liabilities if protection obligations (non‑refoulement, prohibition of arbitrary detention, access to remedy) are not safeguarded.
- Mandate clarity matters: When organizations with operational mandates accept state contracts with protection implications, governments and organizations should ensure clarity of mandate, internal safeguards, and mechanisms for independent oversight.
- Risk management and reputational cost: For states, partnering with international organizations to externalize migration management can produce international scrutiny that affects diplomatic standing and soft‑power considerations; for international organizations, such partnerships can compromise perceived neutrality.
- Policy design for India’s strategic culture: For a state like India (which engages regionally on migration, irregular movement and maritime security), the episode underscores the need to balance border management and security concerns with adherence to human‑rights norms. India’s strategic policy-making would benefit from: (a) clear interagency rules for outsourcing migration functions; (b) binding safeguards protecting individuals’ rights; (c) cooperation with UNHCR or independent monitors when asylum issues are involved; and (d) transparent accountability to domestic and international legal standards.

Conclusion
The 2003 criticisms of IOM by HRW and Amnesty crystallize a recurring governance problem: the tension between operational migration management and the normative, legally anchored responsibilities of refugee and human‑rights protection. NGOs’ calls — for transfer of detention management to UNHCR, for independent oversight, and for explicit non‑refoulement assurances — remain instructive for contemporary policy-makers who must design migration and border regimes that reconcile state security concerns with international protection obligations.

### Case study: Allegations against IOM-managed, Australian-funded refugee housing in Indonesia (2022)

Context and actors
- Timeframe: the case emerged publicly in 2022.
- Primary actor: the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a major international migration agency now functionally integrated into the UN system and routinely engaged in migration management, reception and resettlement activities worldwide.
- Funders and commissioning state: the government of Australia provided funding for community housing in Indonesia that was administered by IOM.
- Critics and sources: the Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA), with allegations reported in The Globe and Mail via researchers Asher Hirsch and Cameron Doig. Testimony from affected persons—most prominently a Rohingya resident, John Joniad—was also cited.

Allegations and reported conditions
- The RCOA and the reporting researchers accused IOM of presenting a “humanitarian veneer” while operating facilities that, in practice, subjected residents to severe rights infringements on behalf of donor-state migration policies.
- Reported conditions included: effective solitary confinement; shortages of basic necessities and access to medical care; instances of physical and sexual abuse; and severe overcrowding. One resident characterized the housing as an “open prison.”
- The affected population in this case included Rohingya refugees, an ethnically persecuted group from Myanmar known to seek refuge in several regional transit countries, including Indonesia.

Operational and accountability dynamics
- Funding and control: donor funding (from Australia) to an international organization (IOM) for operations in a third country (Indonesia) creates layered accountability lines. These may dilute direct oversight by the donor, complicate legal responsibility, and create incentives for expedient operational choices to satisfy donor objectives (e.g., border management, deterrence).
- IOM’s mandate and functions: as a migration agency, IOM runs reception, accommodation and assistance programs but operates under varying contractual arrangements and with differing monitoring and reporting obligations depending on donor agreements and host-state permissions.
- Oversight gaps: the case highlights potential gaps in external monitoring, complaint mechanisms for residents, and independent investigation when allegations arise—especially where operations are effectively outsourced to international agencies operating in host states with limited transparency.

Legal, ethical and policy implications
- Human rights and international responsibility: if substantiated, the allegations raise questions about compliance with international refugee and human-rights norms by donor states and implementing agencies, and whether outsourcing migration control can violate non-refoulement, detention safeguards, and the right to health and safety.
- Accountability of international organizations: the case underscores tensions in holding intergovernmental agencies accountable when they execute donor-driven policies that may contravene rights standards. Legal liability is often diffuse: donor states, implementers (IOM), and host states may each disclaim exclusive responsibility.
- Donor incentive structures: funding models that tie operational payments to deterrence metrics or cost-containment can distort service provision and undermine protection obligations.
- Reputational and regional-security effects: reports of abuse can erode the legitimacy of international actors, fuel local tensions, and complicate regional cooperation on migration—affecting broader stability in South and Southeast Asia.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Precedent and caution for Indian policy-makers: India’s strategic calculus on migration, border management and regional humanitarian engagement should note the risks of outsourcing management to third parties without robust oversight. The Indonesian case exemplifies how externalized migration controls can produce human-rights crises that have diplomatic and security fallout.
- Bilateral and multilateral implications: abuses associated with donor-funded operations can strain relations with host states and civil-society actors, complicating India’s role as a security provider and normative actor in the region.
- Domestic and normative considerations: Indian policy-makers balancing deterrence, regional influence and normative commitments (e.g., to human rights and refugee protection) must design funding and operational agreements that preserve accountability, transparency and access to remedies to avoid strategic and reputational costs.

Recommended follow-up and safeguards (investigative and policy steps)
- Independent verification: commission or seek independent investigations and fact-finding reports (UN-mandated or credible NGOs) to corroborate or refute the RCOA allegations and resident testimonies.
- Clarify funding agreements: make donor-implementer contracts publicly available when possible and specify monitoring, reporting and remedial obligations; require independent audit clauses for sensitive operations.
- Strengthen protection and complaint mechanisms: ensure IOM-run (or otherwise managed) facilities provide unhindered access to medical, legal and psychosocial care, and establish confidential and independent complaint and investigation channels for residents.
- Reform donor incentives: avoid payment structures that reward deterrence outcomes without safeguards; condition funding on demonstrable compliance with protection standards and transparent monitoring.
- Policy learning for India: incorporate clauses on independent oversight and human-rights compliance into any future contracts with multilateral organizations or third states; prioritize regional coordination mechanisms that combine operational management with transparent accountability.

Concise synthesis
In 2022 the RCOA and journalists reported allegations that Australian-funded, IOM-run refugee housing in Indonesia operated under a “humanitarian veneer” while subjecting Rohingya residents to inhumane conditions—an episode that underscores the complex accountability challenges when donor states outsource migration management. For Indian strategic planners, the case offers a cautionary lesson: operationalizing migration policy through third parties without stringent oversight can produce legal, ethical and security liabilities that undermine both normative goals and regional stability.

### IOM and the Uyghur Protection Controversy (2024): Unable or Unwilling?

In 2024 the International Organization for Migration (IOM) — a UN-related agency charged with managing migration — came under public scrutiny for its response to certain refugee protection cases involving Uyghurs, the predominantly Muslim ethnic minority from China’s Xinjiang region. Critics alleged that IOM had been either unable or unwilling to intervene on behalf of Uyghur asylum-seekers. This brief section dissects that allegation, situates it within the legal and institutional architecture of international protection, and assesses the strategic and normative implications — including for states such as India that must reconcile migration, human rights, and great-power diplomacy.

Nature of the allegation
- The charge is twofold: first, that IOM failed to act effectively in specific cases; second, that it may have done so for reasons other than incapacity — i.e., political reticence or external pressure. The alternating formulation “unable or unwilling” captures the analytical ambiguity: is the lapse one of mandate and capacity, or of institutional choice and external influence?

Institutional context and legal principle
- IOM’s role: IOM is principally a migration management organization. It provides logistical, operational, and policy support across a wide range of migration-related activities, and it is formally “related to” the United Nations. However, UNHCR — the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees — is the specialized UN agency with the primary global mandate for refugee protection and asylum adjudication.
- Core legal principle at stake: non-refoulement — the obligation not to return a person to a territory where they would face persecution or serious harm — is a cornerstone of international refugee law and customary international law. Allegations that IOM failed to protect Uyghur claimants implicate, directly or indirectly, risks to the operationalization of non-refoulement in practice.

Why the ambiguity arises: constraints on response
Several legitimate, structural reasons can explain a limited or delayed IOM response. These do not, however, absolve political accountability:
- Mandate boundaries: IOM does not typically provide refugee status determination; that function rests with UNHCR or competent national authorities. Where mandates overlap or are unclear on the ground, protection gaps may emerge.
- Host-state consent: Humanitarian and migration actors operate with the consent of the state in which they work. Where host governments are resistant to granting protection or to independent action, operational options are constrained.
- Funding and resourcing: Shortfalls in funding can limit capacity to provide protection-oriented services, legal assistance, or relocation support.
- Political pressure and geopolitics: Major-power influence (including that exerted by China) can shape states’ policies and international organizations’ room for manoeuvre, whether through direct diplomatic pressure, conditionality in bilateral cooperation, or broader political calculations.

Implications — institutional, normative, and strategic
- Reputational risk and scrutiny: Perceived failure to protect vulnerable groups damages IOM’s credibility and invites intensified oversight by NGOs, parliaments, donors, and the media.
- Calls for clearer division of responsibilities: The controversy underscores persistent confusion about where migration management ends and refugee protection begins. It strengthens the argument for sharper, codified delineation between IOM’s operational remit and UNHCR’s protection mandate, especially in mixed-migration contexts.
- Policy and procedural reforms: Possible outcomes include demands for clearer internal guidance on referrals to UNHCR, stronger safeguards to ensure non-refoulement, enhanced transparency in decision-making, and conditionality in donor support to ensure protection obligations are respected.
- Protection architecture for vulnerable groups: The episode may catalyse efforts to develop regional protection mechanisms, emergency pathways, and third-country resettlement options tailored to targeted minorities such as Uyghurs.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national-security policy
For India, the IOM–Uyghur controversy intersects with several dimensions of strategic calculation:
- Diplomatic balancing: India must weigh human-rights concerns and domestic civil-society pressures against the imperatives of managing a fraught relationship with China. How international organizations perform in protection cases affects India’s reputational calculus.
- Migration and domestic security: Potential influxes of persecuted minorities can pose administrative and security-management challenges, requiring clear domestic procedures consistent with non-refoulement norms.
- Normative posture and regional leadership: The episode presents an opportunity for India to advocate for clearer international rules and regional protection frameworks that reconcile humanitarian obligations with sovereign prerogatives.

Conclusion
The 2024 criticism — framed as “unable or unwilling” — is telling because it exposes a structural fault line in the international protection ecosystem: the fragmentation between migration management and refugee protection opens both operational gaps and spaces for political pressure to shape outcomes. Addressing these weaknesses requires institutional clarification between IOM and UNHCR, strengthened procedural safeguards for non-refoulement, and a willingness by states and donors to prioritize protection even when geopolitics complicates their choices. For states like India, the controversy is not merely an abstract institutional dispute but a practical and normative issue with direct bearings on national security policy and diplomatic positioning.
