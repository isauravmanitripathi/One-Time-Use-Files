# Eurasian multilateral security organization

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is the principal multilateral institution spanning much of Eurasia, combining political, economic and security functions. As an intergovernmental organization, it has acquired outsized importance because of its geographic reach, demographic weight and the presence of several major powers within its membership. For students of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the SCO presents both opportunities for cooperation on shared threats and dilemmas arising from competing regional interests.

## Origins and institutional evolution
- The SCO evolved from the “Shanghai Five” mechanism (1996), which brought together China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan to resolve border and security issues inherited from the Soviet dissolution.  
- In June 2001 the grouping expanded to include Uzbekistan and formally constituted itself as the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with objectives extending beyond border settlement to broader political, economic and security cooperation.  
- The organisation’s membership increased in phases: India and Pakistan were admitted in June 2017; Iran became a full member in July 2023; Belarus joined in July 2024. Other states engage as observers or dialogue partners.

## Membership and scope (as of 2024)
Members: China, Russia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, Belarus.  
The SCO is the world’s largest regional organisation by geographic scope and population:
- Covers roughly 24% of the world’s land area (about 65% of Eurasia).  
- Encompasses approximately 42% of the global population.  
- Economic weight: combined nominal GDP of members is about 23% of global GDP; on a purchasing-power-parity (PPP) basis members account for about 36% of world GDP.

These figures underline the SCO’s potential as a platform for regional economic integration, trade and infrastructure cooperation, alongside its primary security mandate.

## Governance and institutional architecture
- Supreme body: Heads of State Council (HSC), which meets annually and sets the SCO’s strategic direction.  
- Operational coordination: regular meetings of foreign ministers, national coordinators and working groups across policy areas. Chairmanship rotates annually among member states, shaping summit agendas and priorities.  
- Specialized structures: the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) is the SCO’s main operational instrument for security cooperation (see below).

The SCO remains essentially intergovernmental: decisions require consensus, institutional depth is limited compared with formal supranational organisations, and implementation of collective decisions depends heavily on bilateral willingness.

## Security architecture: RATS and counterterrorism
- The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), based in Tashkent, focuses on counterterrorism, violent extremism and transnational organised crime. Its core functions include intelligence and information exchange, coordinating joint exercises, and cooperating on legal and law-enforcement measures.  
- RATS enables joint drills, shared watchlists and mechanisms for rapid exchange of information on extremist networks—areas of direct relevance to India’s counterterrorism priorities.  
- Despite operational activity, the extent of intelligence-sharing and joint action is constrained by political sensitivities and differing threat perceptions among members.

## Strategic role and political dynamics
- The SCO serves as a diplomatic platform where major regional powers—most notably China and Russia—coordinate on regional security and political issues, often presenting a counterweight to Western-dominated institutions.  
- It is also a forum for managing intra-regional competition: India and Pakistan’s simultaneous membership is an unusual feature that reflects both the organisation’s inclusive ambition and the practical difficulty of homogenising member interests.  
- Observers and dialogue partners (a mix of neighbouring Eurasian states and non-regional actors) extend the SCO’s diplomatic reach but do not dilute the core intergovernmental character.

## Economic potential and limitations
- Given its demographic and GDP aggregates, the SCO has latent economic significance for trade, infrastructure and connectivity projects across Eurasia. In practice, however, economic cooperation is incremental and often subordinate to strategic and political considerations.  
- Connectivity initiatives are an area of potential synergy, but differences in member preferences—particularly India’s scepticism towards some China-led projects—temper prospects for deep, organisation-wide economic integration.

## Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Membership calculus: India’s accession in 2017 reflected a desire to engage multilateral mechanisms in Eurasia, advance counterterrorism cooperation, and maintain a diplomatic presence in a China–Russia-centred forum rather than be excluded from regional decision-making.  
- Opportunities for India:
  - Expanded counterterrorism cooperation through RATS and bilateral channels within SCO frameworks.  
  - Platform to pursue connectivity and economic ties with Central Asian states, diversify energy and trade routes, and project neighbourhood policy beyond South Asia.  
  - Diplomatic leverage by participating in a major Eurasian forum where multiple great powers interact.
- Constraints and dilemmas:
  - India–Pakistan rivalry often limits scope for collective action; political tensions can impede functional cooperation.  
  - The SCO’s strategic tilt—given China–Russia leadership—requires India to manage simultaneous engagement and strategic hedging.  
  - Institutional limitations (consensus decision-making, limited enforcement mechanisms) constrain the SCO’s capacity to produce binding security outcomes that address India’s full range of national security concerns.

## Conclusion
The SCO is a consequential Eurasian institution that combines security, political and economic agendas across a broad and populous region. For India, the organisation presents pragmatic opportunities to cooperate on counterterrorism and to engage with Central Asia and major powers within a multilateral setting. At the same time, divergent member interests, bilateral rivalries (notably with Pakistan), and the organisation’s consensus-based, intergovernmental nature limit the SCO’s capacity to deliver comprehensive, India-centric security solutions. Understanding the SCO therefore requires balancing its institutional reach and demographic-economic weight against the political realities that shape member behaviour—an exercise central to India’s strategic culture and national security policymaking.

### The Shanghai Five

The Shanghai Five—formed on 26 April 1996 in Shanghai—constitutes a formative institutional layer in contemporary Eurasian security architecture. Its five founding members—China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan—signed an initial treaty, the Treaty on Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions, explicitly aimed at confidence‑building in military activities along contested and sensitive frontiers. The mechanism that emerged from this modest, technical beginning would soon expand in scope and significance, both for the Central Asian states whose post‑Soviet border cleavages it sought to manage and for larger regional actors monitoring a shifting balance of influence in Eurasia.

Formation, treaties and early legal instruments
- The founding act (26 April 1996) instituted practical measures to reduce the risk of accidental escalation in border zones: notification of military manoeuvres, exchange of information, and a framework for inspections and consultations. These confidence‑building measures addressed the acute uncertainty that accompanied the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the reappearance of international borders in Central Asia.
- A follow‑up instrument, the Treaty on Reduction of Military Forces in Border Regions, was signed in Moscow on 24 April 1997 by the same five states. This treaty translated trust‑building into tangible force‑reduction commitments, signalling a move from ad hoc crisis management toward negotiated de‑militarisation of specific border sectors.
- Complementing these multilateral accords was a notable bilateral political declaration on 20 May 1997 in which Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin endorsed the idea of a “multipolar world.” That formulation carried both normative and strategic freight: it reflected a shared desire by Moscow and Beijing to counterbalance perceived Western (particularly US/NATO) dominance in global affairs.

Summits, Dushanbe decisions and normative commitments
- The Shanghai Five institutionalised regular high‑level consultations. Annual summits followed in Almaty (1998), Bishkek (1999), and Dushanbe (2000), each reinforcing the original confidence‑building agenda while layering on broader political commitments.
- The Dushanbe summit (2000) was especially consequential. Participants agreed to oppose external intervention in internal affairs under the pretext of “humanitarianism” or “protecting human rights,” and pledged mutual support to safeguard national independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and social stability. These declarations enshrined two of the Shanghai Five’s core normative pillars—non‑interference and the primacy of sovereignty—which would become defining motifs in the organisation’s successor formats.

Practical effects and limitations
- On a practical level the Shanghai Five produced measurable security dividends. The mechanism accelerated the resolution of lingering border disputes, enabled coordinated military deployments and withdrawals in sensitive areas, and created consultative channels for addressing cross‑border crime and nascent terrorist threats. In an environment marked by weak central institutions and porous frontiers, these outcomes reduced the immediate risk of inter‑state military incidents.
- Yet the same normative commitments that ensured state buy‑in also constrained the mechanism’s responsiveness to internal crises. The emphasis on non‑interference limited collective action in situations involving gross human rights abuses or internal repression, a limitation that has continued to shape the organisation’s political posture.

Evolution into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and membership dynamics
- The Shanghai Five was not an end point but an evolutionary stage. The mechanism formally expanded into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in June 2001 with the accession of Uzbekistan. The SCO subsequently widened its membership and agenda; by 2017 it had admitted both India and Pakistan as full members, transforming a primarily China‑Russia‑Central Asia security forum into a broader Eurasian platform.
- Early SCO priorities and practices remained rooted in the Shanghai Five legacy: border demarcation, arms reductions, countering cross‑border crime and terrorism, and institutionalised military‑to‑military cooperation.

Strategic implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- For India, the Shanghai Five’s trajectory—and its metamorphosis into the SCO—presents both opportunities and strategic dilemmas that intersect with India’s enduring commitments to strategic autonomy and non‑alignment. India’s accession to the SCO in 2017 signalled a pragmatic willingness to engage with a Eurasian multilateral forum that includes China and Russia, and which prioritises counterterrorism and regional stability.
- At the same time, the Shanghai Five’s normative emphasis on sovereignty and non‑interference dovetails with India’s sensitivities about external meddling but also constrains collective responses to internal crises in member states. India must therefore balance the operational benefits of intelligence sharing and counterterrorism cooperation against potential political costs—especially where China‑Pakistan alignment within the SCO could circumscribe New Delhi’s diplomatic manoeuvre space.
- The “multipolar world” rhetoric that emerged from early Shanghai‑Five diplomacy reflects a Sino‑Russian intent to rebalance Western influence; for India, engagement with the SCO is an instrument to protect strategic interests in Eurasia while retaining freedom of action in bilateral and coalition diplomacy.

Conclusion
The Shanghai Five illustrates how functional, confidence‑building measures can seed more ambitious regional institutions. Its successes in stabilising post‑Soviet border spaces and institutionalising security cooperation were real and durable. Equally important are the limits imposed by its normative architecture—sovereignty, non‑interference and an aversion to normative conditionality—which continue to shape how the SCO operates and how states such as India calibrate their participation. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, the Shanghai Five’s legacy is a reminder that regional order is as much constructed through mechanics of trust and technical cooperation as through explicit power politics—and that institutional membership entails both tangible security benefits and complex geopolitical trade‑offs.

## Developing institutional forms

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) illustrates how a pragmatic, regionally rooted security mechanism can be deliberately transformed into a formal international organisation with broader political, economic and normative ambitions. Between 2001 and the late 2000s the original Shanghai Five arrangement — a pragmatic border-confidence mechanism among China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan (later joined by Uzbekistan) — was recast into a charter-based multilateral organisation with permanent bodies, an expanding programmatic agenda, and an increasingly global-facing posture. For students of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, this institutional evolution mattered because it created a new, routinised multilateral forum in Eurasia in which New Delhi would later seek both strategic space and constraints.

Key steps in the institutionalisation process
- 2001: The annual summit returned to Shanghai and the leaders moved to formalise the mechanism into a more structured organisation. The earlier Shanghai Five had already admitted Uzbekistan, producing a six-party practical framework that provided the empirical basis for institutional upgrade.
- 15 June 2001: The six heads of state signed the “Declaration of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation,” explicitly endorsing the Shanghai Five record and setting out a political intent to elevate cooperation into an organisation with wider scope and permanence.
- June 2002 (Saint Petersburg): SCO heads adopted the SCO Charter, giving substantive content to purposes, principles, membership rules and the organisation’s structures and operational forms.
- 19 September 2003: The SCO Charter entered into force, providing the legal foundation required for routine diplomacy, decision-making procedures and institutional development.
- 2001–2008: A period of brisk institutional growth — the SCO moved beyond summitry and ad hoc meetings to create permanent bodies and launch numerous ad hoc and large-scale initiatives addressing security, economic and infrastructural matters.

Permanent bodies and bureaucratic routines
Institutionalisation produced both formal organs and routinised meeting practices. The SCO established a permanent secretariat and the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS), along with standing working groups and regular sectoral meetings. By 2007 the organisation convened frequent and regular sessions across domains — security, military and defence consultations; foreign-ministry and national-coordinator meetings; economic and financial dialogue; cultural and people-to-people contacts — embedding cooperation in bureaucratic routines rather than one-off summits. The emergence of a bureaucratic infrastructure enabled the SCO both to manage multi-year projects and to project continuity even as political leadership in capitals changed.

Agenda diversification and programmatic expansion
Institutional growth was accompanied by a broadening agenda. By 2007 the SCO had initiated over twenty large-scale projects in transport, energy and telecommunications — concrete lines of activity that signalled a strategic focus on regional connectivity and economic integration alongside the organisation’s original counterterrorism and border-stability remit. The SCO’s agenda therefore came to combine:
- Traditional security cooperation (counterterrorism, border security, military exercises);
- Economic and infrastructure projects (transport corridors, energy pipelines, telecom initiatives);
- Institutional cooperation in banking, culture and education.

Expansion of membership and the India–Pakistan cases
Expansion of membership was a watershed in the SCO’s development and in its implications for regional geopolitics.
- July 2005 (Astana): India, Iran, Mongolia and Pakistan attended an SCO summit as guests/participants for the first time — a clear signal of the organisation’s widening reach.
- Nazarbayev’s remark at that time that “the leaders... are representatives of half of humanity” captured the ambition and perceived global relevance that SCO leaders were beginning to cultivate.
- July 2015 (Ufa): SCO leaders decided to admit India and Pakistan as full members; this was a formal decision to enlarge the organisation’s core.
- June 2016 (Tashkent): India and Pakistan signed memoranda of obligations, the procedural step initiating their formal accession processes.
- June 2017 (Astana, Kazakhstan): India and Pakistan became full members of the SCO.

The admission of India and Pakistan had immediate and ongoing consequences: it substantially increased the organisation’s demographic and geopolitical weight but also introduced deeper internal diversity and direct bilateral rivalry inside the forum. For India, accession opened a new multilateral space for engagement with Central Asian states, China and Russia on counterterrorism, connectivity and regional stability — but it also meant institutionalising Pakistan as a co-equal interlocutor in the same multilateral setting.

External relations and international legitimacy
As it consolidated internally, the SCO also sought external linkages to enhance its multilateral footprint and normative legitimacy. From 2004 onwards the organisation established formal relations with a range of international and regional bodies — including the United Nations (observer in the General Assembly), the Commonwealth of Independent States (2005), ASEAN (2005), the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO, 2007), the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO, 2007), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC, 2011), the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA, 2014), and ESCAP (2015). The SCO’s RATS branch further expanded outreach: in 2018 RATS established relations with the African Union’s African Centre for the Study and Research on Terrorism (ACSRT). These ties signalled an intention to network multilaterally and to present SCO-produced policies — especially on counterterrorism — as having trans-regional relevance.

Interpretation and implications for India’s strategic culture
The SCO’s institutionalization has normative and practical implications for India’s strategic posture:
- A new multilateral arena: The SCO became a routinised forum where India could pursue counterterrorism cooperation, energy and connectivity interests, and diplomatic engagement with Central Asian republics in a way that complements bilateral diplomacy.
- Constraints and opportunities of cohort membership: Sharing a platform with China, Russia and Pakistan constrains unilateral manoeuvre but also offers leverage through multilateral coalitions and norms-building. India’s strategic culture — which balances non-alignment, strategic autonomy and selective alignment — found in the SCO both an opportunity for engagement and a challenge in reconciling divergent priorities (for example, India’s objections to CPEC-related issues).
- Institutionalisation as policy “stickiness”: The SCO’s charter, consensus decision-making practices and permanent bodies produce path-dependencies. Once projects and routines are in place, they require management and often produce incentives for cooperation even when bilateral difficulties persist.
- Counterterrorism and capacity-building: RATS and the SCO’s counterterrorism architecture offered India additional mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, joint exercises and legal cooperation, aligning with India’s security priorities in Central and South Asia while also necessitating careful management of trust given the presence of Pakistan in the same structures.
- Economic connectivity: The SCO’s transport, energy and telecom projects present both opportunities for India to engage with Eurasian economic networks and strategic dilemmas where China-led initiatives (notably those tied to Pakistan) run up against India’s territorial and sovereignty concerns.

Concluding assessment
The transformation from Shanghai Five confidence-building to a charter-based SCO was more than institutional housekeeping: it created an enduring Eurasian organisation with legal personality, bureaucratic capacity and an expanding portfolio. For Indian strategic thinking, the SCO constitutes a double-edged institutional form — a platform that enlarges New Delhi’s multilateral options in Central and West Asia while simultaneously embedding Pakistan and deepening China’s influence in a shared forum. Understanding how India navigates the SCO’s institutional routines, projects and external linkages is therefore essential for assessing contemporary shifts in India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

## The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation: Institutional Architecture and Implications for Indian Strategic Culture

Overview  
The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a multilayered regional organisation whose structures combine political-summitry organs, ministerial councils and permanent executive bodies. Its architecture is built to manage a mixture of security, political-diplomatic and socio-economic cooperation among members. Key features are: an explicit hierarchy of councils; permanent executive organs (the Secretariat and the Regional Anti‑Terrorist Structure, RATS); formal rotation and fixed terms for senior executives; and institutional dispersion of headquarters across member capitals. These design choices have practical implications for member-state behaviour, including India’s strategic calculations and national security policy.

1. Councils and decision-making organs

- Council of Heads of State (supreme decision-making body)  
  - Role and practice: The Council of Heads of State is the SCO’s highest political organ. It meets annually at the SCO summit hosted by a member state and issues the organisation’s major decisions and strategic declarations. This council sets overall policy direction and legitimates the organisation’s most consequential initiatives.  
  - Constitutional accommodation: Members with different constitutional arrangements are accommodated in practice — notably, India and Pakistan typically send their prime ministers (not presidents) to Heads of State summits because their executive authority resides with the prime minister. This operational flexibility is important for the SCO’s inclusivity and affects how India projects representation within the forum.  
  - Membership snapshot (as of 4 July 2024): Aleksandr Lukashenko (Belarus), Xi Jinping (China), Narendra Modi (India), Masoud Pezeshkian (Iran), Kassym‑Jomart Tokayev (Kazakhstan), Sadyr Japarov (Kyrgyzstan), Shehbaz Sharif (Pakistan), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Emomali Rahmon (Tajikistan), Shavkat Mirziyoyev (Uzbekistan). The inclusion of Belarus and Iran reflects SCO expansion beyond its original China–Russia–Central Asia nucleus.

- Council of Heads of Government (second tier)  
  - Role and practice: The Heads of Government council meets annually to manage operational cooperation, coordinate economic and administrative matters, and — importantly — approve the SCO’s budget. It functions as the forum for implementing the strategic directions set by Heads of State.  
  - India’s practice: While formally a council of prime ministers or equivalents, India’s participation has sometimes been represented by deputies at past meetings (e.g., EAM S. Jaishankar attending a 2021 summit in lieu of the prime minister), illustrating flexible delegation norms.  
  - Membership snapshot (as of 1 November 2022): Aleksandr Turchin (Belarus), Li Qiang (China), Narendra Modi (India) — often represented by deputies, Alihan Smaiylov (Kazakhstan), Akylbek Japarov (Kyrgyzstan), Shehbaz Sharif (Pakistan) — sometimes represented by deputies, Mikhail Mishustin (Russia), Qohir Rasulzoda (Tajikistan), Abdulla Aripov (Uzbekistan).

- Council of Foreign Ministers and Council of National Coordinators  
  - The Council of Foreign Ministers convenes regularly (documented since at least 2007) to discuss international situations and co‑ordination with other international organisations.  
  - The Council of National Coordinators (active in working coordination as of 2021) synchronises the technical implementation of SCO projects and cooperative mechanisms across capitals. These bodies form the administrative and diplomatic backbone supporting the summit-level decisions.

2. Permanent executive bodies: Secretariat and RATS

- SCO Secretariat (Beijing)  
  - Functions: Located in Beijing, the Secretariat is the primary permanent executive organ. It implements SCO decisions and decrees, drafts declarations and summit agendas, maintains the organisation’s documents, arranges SCO activities, and disseminates official information. These routine functions make the Secretariat central to agenda management and institutional continuity.  
  - Leadership and rotation: The Secretary‑General is elected for a three‑year term, reflecting the SCO’s practice of temporal rotation for senior posts. Heads of the Secretariat from 2004 onward (selected): Zhang Deguang (Executive Secretary 15 Jan 2004–2006), Bolat Nurgaliyev (2007–2009), Muratbek Imanaliyev (2010–2012), Dmitry Mezentsev (2013–2015), Rashid Alimov (2016–2018), Vladimir Norov (2019–2021), Zhang Ming (2022–2024), Nurlan Yermekbayev (2025–present; assumed office 1 Jan 2025 in the records).  
  - Strategic significance for India: The Secretariat’s Beijing location and its role in setting agendas can shape sectoral emphases and language of cooperation. For India, this introduces both an opportunity to steer substantive agenda items (through active diplomacy and national coordinators) and a sensitivity to perceptual influence given China’s hosting role.

- Regional Anti‑Terrorist Structure (RATS) — Executive Committee (Tashkent)  
  - Mission and functions: Headquartered in Tashkent, RATS is the SCO’s permanent counterterrorism organ, tasked with harmonising member responses to terrorism, separatism and extremism (the SCO’s “three evils”). It facilitates intelligence exchange, joint exercises, and legal‑police cooperation among members.  
  - Leadership and rotation: The Director of the RATS Executive Committee serves a three‑year term; member states also station permanent representatives at RATS. Directors have rotated among member states: Vyacheslav Kasymov (2004–2006), Myrzakan Subanov (2007–2009), Dzhenisbek Dzhumanbekov (2010–2012), Zhang Xinfeng (2013–2015), Yevgeniy Sysoev (2016–2018), Jumakhon Giyosov (2019–2021), Ruslan Mirzaev (2022–2024), Ularbek Sharsheev (2025–present; from 1 Jan 2025).  
  - Strategic significance for India: RATS aligns with India’s counterterrorism priorities and offers a multilateral platform for operational co‑operation on shared threats originating in or transiting Central and South Asia. However, India must balance engagement in RATS with concerns about differing threat perceptions, intelligence‑sharing sensitivities, and participation by states with competing regional agendas.

3. Language, youth outreach and soft power mechanisms

- Official languages: The SCO’s formal working languages are Chinese and Russian. This bilingual framework structures documentation, interpretation and internal communication. For countries like India, which operate primarily in English and multiple regional languages, practical participation requires translation and interpretation arrangements — factors that subtly shape diplomatic practice and the cost of active engagement.  
- Youth engagement: The SCO supports people‑to‑people initiatives, including a youth organisation (the SCO Youth) and the SCO Foundation aimed at youth cooperation. These mechanisms project soft power, cultivate networks of future elites, and provide non‑security avenues for India to pursue cultural and educational diplomacy within the SCO’s ambit.

4. Institutional implications and reading for India’s national security policy

- Hierarchy and pathways of influence: The SCO’s institutional hierarchy — Heads of State at the apex, followed by Heads of Government, Foreign Ministers, National Coordinators and permanent bodies — creates multiple access points for India to advance strategic priorities. India’s use of prime ministerial representation at Heads of State meetings underscores New Delhi’s desire to be present at the highest political table while simultaneously using ministerial and technical channels to shape implementation.  
- Rotation and shared ownership: Three‑year terms and the geographic dispersion of headquarters (Secretariat in Beijing; RATS in Tashkent) institutionalise a degree of shared ownership. For India, this offers balanced opportunities for leadership and influence, but also requires sustained bureaucratic investment to convert procedural rotation into substantive policy footprints.  
- Security cooperation vs. strategic competition: RATS’ counterterrorism focus dovetails with India’s security imperatives, offering a structured forum for cooperation on cross‑border militancy and extremist networks. Yet the SCO also includes strategic competitors and partners whose objectives do not always align with India’s. India’s strategic culture — which privileges strategic autonomy, diversification of partnerships and calibrated multilateral engagement — informs how it exploits SCO mechanisms: engaging where operational benefits exist (e.g., counterterrorism, connectivity projects that respect sovereignty), while guarding against initiatives that could constrain India’s independent regional policies.  
- Language and representation costs: The predominance of Chinese and Russian necessitates additional translation and institutional engagement costs for India, shaping how New Delhi prioritises its diplomatic resources within the organisation.  
- Soft‑power avenues: Youth and civil‑society channels within the SCO provide India with platforms to project normative influence and cultural diplomacy, aligning with longer‑term objectives of shaping regional narratives conducive to its strategic interests.

Conclusion  
The SCO’s institutional design — combining summit diplomacy, ministerial councils and permanent executive organs with rotating leadership and distributed headquarters — produces both opportunities and constraints for India’s strategic objectives. For Indian national security policy, the SCO is a pragmatic arena: it is valuable for operational counterterrorism cooperation and as a multilateral interlocutor in Eurasia, but it must be engaged selectively and with careful calibration to protect India’s strategic autonomy and broader regional priorities.

### Establishment of the Shanghai Five and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)

Background and chronology
- 1996 — Formation of the "Shanghai Five" (S5): a security‑focused, informal consultative grouping comprising China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Its immediate aims were confidence‑building on border demarcation, demilitarisation of frontier areas and cooperation against separatism, extremism and transnational crime.
- 2001 — Transformation into the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO): Uzbekistan’s inclusion and a widening agenda (political, economic and security cooperation) formalised the SCO in 2001. The organisation developed institutional mechanisms (Council of Heads of State, Council of Heads of Government, Council of Foreign Ministers, and technical bodies such as the Regional Anti‑Terrorist Structure — RATS).
- 1996–2026 (timeline framework): schematically, the period 1996–2001 marks the S5 incubator phase; 2001 onwards records SCO institutionalisation and expansion (membership, observers, dialogue partners). The vertical year list in the original chart is meant to map when each state entered a particular engagement tier.

Members, observers and partners (schematic roster and engagement categories)
- Founding S5 members (1996 → SCO core):
  - China — founding member; central actor in agenda setting and institutional evolution.
  - Russia — founding member; co‑principal alongside China, with deep security and diplomatic interests in Central Asia.
  - Kazakhstan — founding S5 and SCO member; major Central Asian stakeholder.
  - Kyrgyzstan — founding S5 and SCO member; local security concerns (borders, militancy) are core to SCO functions.
  - Tajikistan — founding S5 and SCO member; strong interest in counterterrorism and border stability.
- Uzbekistan — joined the S5 process and its accession precipitated formal SCO creation (2001).
- Later entrants to full membership:
  - India — acceded as a full member in 2017; uses SCO as a platform for regional diplomacy, counterterrorism cooperation and connectivity discussions.
  - Pakistan — acceded as a full member in 2017; its membership introduced bilateral tensions (India–Pakistan) into SCO dynamics.
  - Iran — elevated to full member status in the 2020s (formalised in 2023), reflecting SCO’s opening to select Middle Eastern states.
- Observers and dialogue partners (typical roles, status varies over time):
  - Observers: Mongolia has long held observer status; Afghanistan’s status has been especially politically sensitive (the chart’s explicit label “Afghanistan (Islamic Republic)” flags a specific historical posture before 2021).
  - Dialogue partners/engaged states (examples listed on the chart): Belarus, Sri Lanka, Turkey, Cambodia, Azerbaijan, Nepal, Armenia, Egypt, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives, Myanmar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain. Their participation ranges from regular dialogue and cooperation agreements to occasional summit invitations or sectoral engagement (economy, culture, security).
- Legend interpretation: the chart distinguishes three engagement categories — Member, Observer, Dialogue Partner — each carrying different procedural rights and obligations within SCO structures.

Institutional rules, mechanisms and differentiation of status
- Full members:
  - Participate in decision‑making bodies (Heads of State/Government Councils); are bound by SCO agreements and are eligible to shape SCO policy across security, economic and political tracks.
  - Contribute to mechanisms such as RATS (counterterrorism intelligence‑sharing and joint exercises).
- Observers:
  - Have more limited access to deliberations; may attend summits and some working groups but do not hold voting power.
  - Often use observer status to deepen ties before seeking full membership (or to retain flexibility without full obligations).
- Dialogue partners:
  - Engage at a lower intensity — sectoral cooperation, memoranda of understanding, participation in selected forums (economy, culture, trade).
  - Serve as a diplomatic bridge between the SCO and external regions (South Asia, the Gulf, Southeast Asia).

Interpreting the schematic timeline
- The original graphic’s arrows and year markers are designed to show when each country moved into a particular engagement tier (e.g., S5 founding in 1996; SCO founding 2001; India/Pakistan full membership in 2017; Iran’s elevation in the early 2020s).
- To use the chart precisely: align country rows with the vertical year axis to read accession dates or the onset of observer/dialogue relations.

Strategic implications for India — analytical overview
- Opportunity structure:
  - Regional security and counterterrorism: SCO provides a multilateral forum addressing “three evils” (terrorism, separatism, extremism). For India, the platform supplements bilateral counterterrorism cooperation and offers intelligence‑sharing possibilities.
  - Central Asian connectivity and energy access: SCO engagement is one avenue (among many) for Indian efforts to deepen ties with Central Asian capitals — for energy, transport corridors and economic linkages.
  - Multilateral presence: SCO participation signals India’s willingness to pursue a Eurasian multilateral diplomacy that complements its West‑look and Indo‑Pacific policies.
- Constraints and strategic caution:
  - China–Pakistan axis and consensus politics: SCO’s consensus decision‑making and the presence of China–Pakistan proximity limit India’s ability to use SCO to directly counter adversaries or to press mandates inimical to other members’ interests.
  - Limitations of institutional depth: despite expanded membership and partners, the SCO’s remit and enforcement mechanisms remain limited compared with formal security alliances; its economic instruments are modest.
  - Afghanistan and political sensitivities: Afghanistan’s shifting status (the chart’s “Islamic Republic” label captures pre‑2021 realities) complicates cooperation. India must balance humanitarian and reconstruction interests against the SCO’s member states’ divergent stances on Kabul.
- Strategic posture: India utilises SCO membership instrumentally — to diversify partnerships (especially with Central Asian states and Russia), to endorse multilateral counterterrorism norms, and to contest, indirectly, exclusive regional architectures. At the same time, India preserves independent bilateral options (e.g., with Central Asia, Russia, Iran) outside formal SCO constraints.

Concluding synthesis
- The schematic timeline and roster underscore the SCO’s evolution from a narrowly defined Central Asian security club (Shanghai Five) to a broader Eurasian organisation with layered engagement categories (members, observers, dialogue partners).
- For India — which joined as a full member in 2017 — the SCO is a pragmatic instrument: it expands India’s multilateral footprint in Eurasia, offers a channel for security cooperation, and presents both opportunities for engagement and constraints imposed by the organisation’s composition and decision‑making norms.
- When reading the original chart, treat the rows as status trajectories (Member / Observer / Dialogue Partner) mapped against accession years (1996–2026). This yields a useful visual of how the SCO has geographically and functionally broadened — a trend with direct bearing on India’s strategic calculations in Central and South Asia and the wider Eurasian theatre.

### 3.x The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation: membership timeline and implications for India

Summary of the source extract
- The source is a short tabular extract (likely from Wikipedia) that lists SCO full members together with two temporal fields: “Accession started” and “Member since.” The extract is accompanied by a note about a clickable Euler diagram (a visual of overlapping Asian regional organisations) and the usual Wikipedia navigation markers (“v • t • e”).
- The table’s purpose in that context is to present the formal accession timelines of SCO members rather than to enumerate observers or dialogue partners.

Notes on the table
- Blank or dash (“—”) entries under “Accession started” signal founding membership (the SCO was founded in June 2001) or omitted data in the excerpt; China and the five Central Asian republics above are original members.
- Pakistan’s accession process is not shown in this excerpt, but Pakistan became a full member at the same summit as India in June 2017.
- The two-date format reflects different moments in the admission process: a formal beginning of accession procedures (often a Heads-of-State decision or formal invitation) and the date when full membership legally took effect.

Interpretation and key analytical points
- The SCO’s composition has grown from a Central Asian + China/Russia core to include South Asia (India, Pakistan), West Asian (Iran), and — with Belarus — a post‑Soviet European element. This enlargement from six founding members (China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan) to ten full members signals geopolitical widening.
- “Accession started” typically marks the formal launch of admission procedures (political consent, internal assessments, and intergovernmental negotiations). “Member since” indicates the date when full legal status was conferred.
- The expansion chronology matters for India’s strategic calculus: accession timelines show how long the SCO’s deliberative and consensus‑driven processes can be, and how membership was used by new entrants to institutionalize regional ties.
- The table focuses on full members. The SCO also operates with other statuses (observers, dialogue partners), which have different rights and obligations and are relevant to India’s engagement strategy.

Context: SCO purpose, membership categories and procedures
- Founded: June 2001. Original goals: deepen regional security cooperation (counter‑terrorism, extremism, separatism), enhance political consultation, and promote economic cooperation among members.
- Membership categories: full members (voting, full participation), observer states, and dialogue partners. Admission to full membership requires consensus and completion of internal domestic steps; the interval between “accession started” and “member since” reflects this multilayered approval.
- The SCO’s agenda combines security, economic, and political dimensions. Its security mechanisms (notably the Regional Anti‑Terrorist Structure) are focal points for cooperation; economic items have grown but are less institutionalized.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s accession timeline (accession started 10 June 2015; full member 9 June 2017) is strategically significant:
  - Pragmatic hedging: SCO membership complements India’s bilateral and multilateral engagements (BRICS, QUAD) and allows New Delhi to engage directly on Central Asian security issues and counter‑terrorism formats where India seeks operational cooperation and intelligence exchange.
  - Great‑power dynamics: India’s presence institutionalizes its diplomatic footprint in a forum where China and Russia wield strong influence. India must manage benefits (access, influence) against risks (forum capture by bilateral rivals or the downplaying of contentious bilateral issues).
  - Pakistan’s concurrent accession (2017) complicates proceedings from India’s perspective: SCO can be an arena for both cooperation and rivalry, and India must calibrate participation to protect sensitive security interests while advancing regional cooperation.
- Iran’s accession (process 2021–2023) and Belarus’s accession (2022–2024) further diversify the SCO’s geopolitical scope:
  - Iran: brings West Asian connectivity and energy/security linkages into the SCO. For India, Iran’s presence intersects with India’s West Asia policy, its energy interests, and connectivity projects (e.g., Chabahar).
  - Belarus: its entry marks a westward tilt into the post‑Soviet European space, raising questions about the SCO’s evolving identity and India’s role in a geographically and politically broader organisation.
- Operationally, India uses the SCO to:
  - pursue counter‑terror cooperation and intelligence sharing on transnational threats;
  - advance connectivity and economic linkages with Central Asia while balancing China’s Belt and Road proliferation;
  - maintain dialogue with Russia on Eurasian security issues;
  - manage multilateral exposure to Pakistan and Iran in formats that include security and political interaction.

Source reliability and verification
- The extract appears to mirror secondary sources (e.g., Wikipedia). For academic or policy use, verify dates and procedural meanings against primary documents: the SCO Charter, official summit communiqués, and statements by member states’ foreign ministries.
- Blank cells or abbreviated entries in public encyclopaedias may reflect editorial brevity rather than formal legal distinctions; always cross‑check before drawing firm conclusions.

Recommendations for researchers and practitioners
- When using accession timelines as evidence in strategic analysis, differentiate between political announcement dates, domestic ratification, and legal entry into the organisation — each stage matters for influence and operational access.
- Situate SCO membership within India’s broader multilateral strategy: membership is one instrument among many (bilaterals, minilateral coalitions) that India uses to project influence, secure economic interests, and respond to security threats.
- Track continuing changes: SCO membership and agenda have evolved post‑2001; consult up‑to‑date official sources for changes after 2024.

Concluding observation
The tabular extract encapsulates how the SCO has transitioned from a Central Asian security forum to a broader Eurasian institution. For India, the 2017 accession was a deliberate strategic choice: to engage a region of security salience, to contest frameworks dominated by others, and to exploit institutional avenues for cooperation on terrorism, connectivity and regional diplomacy — while simultaneously managing the risks of institutionalising engagement with adversaries.

## Shanghai Cooperation Organisation — Observer States

This section analyses a tabular excerpt listing observer states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). The table distinguishes current observers from entities whose observer relationship has since altered. Below I expand each entry, explain the institutional meaning of "observer", and draw out the implications for India's strategic culture and national security policy.

### The table (summary and immediate readings)
- The table is organized in two columns: "Country" and "Status granted".
- Current observers (as recorded in the excerpt)
  - Mongolia — observer; status granted 2004.
  - Afghanistan — observer; status granted 7 June 2012. Annotated as "Inactive since September 2021".
- A separate subsection in the source lists "Former observers"
  - India — listed with date 5 July 2005 (observer status from that date).
  - Pakistan — listed as a former observer (no date provided in the table).
  - Iran — listed as a former observer (no date provided in the table in this excerpt).
  - Belarus — listed with date 2015 (observer status granted that year).

This layout indicates the compiler’s intention to differentiate currently active observers from states that were once observers but subsequently changed status (e.g., upgraded, suspended, or otherwise altered their relationship with the SCO).

### Institutional meaning of "Observer" in multilateral bodies
- Observer status typically confers limited participatory rights: the ability to attend certain meetings, receive documentation, and take part in consultations and select working groups, but not to vote in or determine decisions of the organisation.
- Observer status may be instrumental (a way to engage without full obligations), preparatory (a step toward deeper ties or full membership), or symbolic (a recognition of interest in dialogue).
- The observer → full member trajectory is a common pattern in regional organisations; the table hints at that pathway in at least one clear example (India and Pakistan).

### Entry-by-entry commentary and implications

- Mongolia (observer since 2004)
  - Mongolia’s long-standing observer status reflects its cautious multilateralism between its two large neighbours (Russia and China) and its interest in diversified engagement. For the SCO, Mongolia offers geographic continuity across Eurasia and a partner for niche cooperation (economic corridors, pastoral and border-management experience).

- Afghanistan (observer 7 June 2012; inactive since September 2021)
  - Afghanistan’s “inactive” annotation follows the political rupture after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. Many SCO activities (counter‑terrorism, reconstruction coordination, working groups) depend on stable state interlocutors; the de facto authorities’ lack of broad diplomatic recognition and security cooperation constraints have reduced Afghanistan’s institutional engagement.
  - For India, a reduced Afghan presence in SCO mechanisms narrows platforms for multiliteral dialogue on Afghan security, regional reconstruction, and counter-terrorism — areas in which India has historically invested diplomatically and materially (and which feed directly into New Delhi’s regional-security calculus).

- India (listed as a former observer; date 5 July 2005)
  - The table records India’s observer phase. In practice, India used the observer relationship as part of a cautious, interest-driven approach to the SCO: engaging on counter-terrorism, connectivity and regional stability without ceding independent strategic choices.
  - India’s progression from observer to full member (subsequent upgrade(s) notated outside the excerpt; India was admitted as a full member in 2017) illustrates a deliberate trajectory that aligns with India’s strategic culture: incremental institutional embeddedness when national interests and strategic autonomy can be preserved.

- Pakistan (listed under former observers; date not provided in table)
  - Pakistan’s inclusion in “former observers” signals a changed status; like India, Pakistan moved from observer to full member in the 2017 enlargement. That Pakistan and India travelled the same institutional route (observer → full member) is an important dynamic in SCO politics and affects intra‑regional balancing and Indian policy formulation.

- Iran (listed as a former observer; no date in the excerpt)
  - Iran has been engaged with the SCO for years and has sought closer integration. The table’s classification as a “former observer” indicates a change of status at some later point (upgrade or other alteration). Given Iran’s geopolitical position, its relationship with the SCO is of particular interest for energy linkages, sanctions circumvention concerns, and regional security architectures. Exact dates and the legal form of status change should be cross-checked against SCO communiqués for precision in academic work.

- Belarus (observer status noted 2015)
  - Belarus’s observer status (2015 in this excerpt) is another example of post‑Soviet states engaging the SCO as an alternative or complement to other Eurasian institutions. Whether Belarus’s formal relationship has subsequently shifted (e.g., to greater integration) requires verification from official SCO records.

### Interpretive points relevant to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Institutional choice as strategy: India’s use of observer status before upgrading reflects its preference for incremental, calibrated engagement with multilateral bodies — balancing access to regional mechanisms while guarding strategic autonomy.
- Leverage vs. constraints: Membership (or lack thereof) in SCO structures affects India’s ability to shape regional counter-terrorism norms, connectivity projects, and security dialogues. India’s 2017 full-membership decision (after the observer phase recorded here) represented a weighing of benefits (access, influence) against costs (operating inside an institution where China and Russia hold central sway).
- Afghanistan’s marginalisation from the SCO after 2021 diminishes one institutional avenue for India to pursue its objectives in Kabul and raises barriers for coordinated regional responses to instability that directly affect India (terrorism, migration, narcotics, and strategic competition).
- Observer status as a diplomatic posture: For states such as Mongolia and Belarus, the observer role is consistent with hedging strategies — engaging major regional powers while preserving independent foreign policy space. India’s pathway from observer to member, by contrast, signals a readiness to invest more deeply when rewards exceed strategic caution.

### Limitations of the table and caution for researchers
- Gaps in dating (Pakistan, Iran) and labels (e.g., “former”) mean the table is a concise snapshot rather than a verified timeline. Nuances such as "inactive", "suspended", "upgraded" or dates of formal admission are crucial for analysis but are not consistently recorded.
- Institutional relationships evolve; official SCO summit communiqués, presidential statements and the SCO Charter are the primary sources to confirm legal status changes and their effective dates.

### Recommended follow-up actions (for researchers and policy analysts)
1. Verify the current legal status of Belarus and Iran in the SCO using the latest SCO summit communiqués and official statements.
2. Confirm the procedural basis and practical consequences of Afghanistan’s “inactive” label (e.g., whether Afghanistan is formally suspended, simply not participating, or represented by non‑recognised authorities).
3. Compile a comprehensive timeline for each country of interest: date observer status granted, dates and instruments of any status change (e.g., upgrade to full member), and any suspensions or interruptions.
4. If integrating this into an analysis of India’s national security policy, examine how the observer → member trajectory affected India’s operational access to SCO mechanisms (working groups, counter‑terrorism fora, and connectivity planning) and how that intersects with India’s bilateral strategies toward Russia, China and Central Asian states.

Concluding note: observer listings are small windows into larger geopolitical choices. For India, the movement from observer status to full membership was not merely technical: it reflected a judgement about where institutional participation could further national security aims without undermining strategic autonomy. Any scholarly use of such a table should therefore be accompanied by documentary verification and a sensitivity to the political judgments that lie behind formal labels.

## The SCO “Dialogue Partner” Category: Origins, Practice and Implications for India

Context and definition
- The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) created the formal category of “dialogue partner” in 2008 as a mechanism for structured but limited engagement. Unlike observer status or full membership, dialogue partnership allows states to participate in SCO meetings and activities on a selective basis without taking on full institutional obligations.
- For India, understanding this category is important because it reflects how the SCO manages outreach, calibrates influence, and accommodates diverse regional actors without altering the organisation’s core membership calculus. The category thus becomes an instrument of regional diplomacy with direct bearings on India’s strategic environment — from security cooperation to economic connectivity and great‑power competition.

Chronology and country breakdown
The following list reproduces the patterns evident in SCO records and compilations, showing the uneven formalisation process (some entries have both “approval” and later “granting” dates, others only a single date, and several lack dates in available summaries):

- Sri Lanka — Status approved: 15 or 16 June 2009; Status granted: 6 May 2010.  
- Turkey — Status approved: 7 June 2012; Status granted: 26 April 2013.  
- Cambodia — Status approved: 10 July 2015; Status granted: 24 September 2015.  
- Azerbaijan — Single listed date: 14 March 2016.  
- Nepal — Single listed date: 22 March 2016.  
- Armenia — Single listed date: 16 April 2016.  
- Egypt — Status approved: 16 September 2021; Status granted: 14 September 2022.  
- Qatar — Listed as a dialogue partner in some compilations, but dates are not provided.  
- Saudi Arabia — Listed without dates in some sources.  
- Kuwait — Status approved: 16 September 2022; Status granted: 5 May 2023.  
- Maldives — Listed without dates.  
- Myanmar — Listed without dates.  
- United Arab Emirates — Listed without dates.  
- Bahrain — Single listed date: 15 July 2023.  
- Former dialogue partner — Belarus: Status approved: 15 or 16 June 2009; Status granted: 28 April 2010; later removed or reclassified (noted as “former”).

Administrative process and what the dates mean
- The common two‑date pattern (an “approval” at a summit or ministerial followed by a later “granting” date) indicates that the SCO’s formalisation of dialogue partners has been a two‑step political‑administrative process. The first step is political endorsement (consensus by member states), and the second is administrative admission (registration, exchange of letters, or inclusion in formal lists and institutional activity calendars).
- The presence of single dates or missing dates reflects inconsistent source compilation or staggered national procedures. In some cases a single summit decision was presented as definitive; in others a later ceremony or procedural step was recorded as the formal grant.
- The omission of dates for Gulf states and others in some lists suggests either pending formalisation at the time of compilation or selective recording. That ambiguity matters: it shows the category’s flexibility and the SCO’s ability to keep prospective partners engaged without immediately extending full privileges.

Geographic spread and temporal clustering
- Geographic diversity: Dialogue partners span South Asia (Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives), Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Myanmar), the Caucasus and Eurasia (Azerbaijan, Armenia), as well as significant outreach to the Middle East and Gulf (Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain) and North Africa (Egypt). This demonstrates that the SCO’s outreach intentionally extends beyond its Central Asian base.
- Temporal clusters: Two clear waves appear:
  - Mid‑2015 to mid‑2016: a cluster of approvals/grants (Cambodia, Azerbaijan, Nepal, Armenia) that suggests an active expansion phase.
  - 2021–2023: a renewed round focused on Middle Eastern actors and Gulf states (Egypt’s approval/grant, Kuwait, Bahrain and entries for Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE). This signals a deliberate strategic outreach to the Middle East in recent years.
- Policy reading: these waves imply that the SCO uses dialogue partnership in calibrated bursts to consolidate influence, respond to geopolitical opportunities, or signal a widened agenda (energy, maritime links, counterterrorism, and diplomacy).

Notable cases and irregularities
- Belarus as a “former” dialogue partner is noteworthy. Its removal or reclassification points to three types of explanations that merit further archival and diplomatic inquiry: a) Belarus requested reclassification; b) the SCO adjusted its rules and removed the category for Belarus specifically; or c) shifting diplomatic priorities among member states produced a de facto termination. The fact of a reversal underscores that dialogue partnership is contingent and politically managed.
- Gulf states and several others appearing without dates suggests selective or incremental engagement: the SCO can keep states in a “semi‑formal” relationship while deferring full administrative paperwork. Practically, that flexibility lets the SCO manage sensitivities (e.g., Gulf cooperation with Western partners) while expanding its diplomatic reach.

Strategic implications for the SCO and for India
- For the SCO:
  - Low‑cost expansion: Dialogue partnerships enlarge the organisation’s diplomatic network and agenda without changing the voting or institutional balance of full membership.
  - Issue diversification: Bringing in Gulf and Middle Eastern actors allows the SCO to address new issues (energy security, maritime security, labour migration) and project relevance beyond the Eurasian landmass.
  - Strategic signalling: Invitations and grants can be used as tools of influence, showing which external actors member states—especially China and Russia—wish to cultivate.
- For India’s strategic culture and national security policy:
  - Competitive space with China and Russia: As the SCO deepens ties with South Asian and Middle Eastern states, India must assess how expanded SCO networks affect its own bilateral and multilateral partnerships. China’s strong role in the SCO means that any enlargement offers Beijing additional venues to build influence in India’s neighbourhood and in third regions important to Indian interests (Gulf energy supplies, African and Middle Eastern diplomacy).
  - Opportunities for cooperation: Dialogue partnerships can be platforms for counterterrorism cooperation, information‑sharing, and connectivity discussions that are also in India’s interest. India should therefore calibrate engagement to secure practical outcomes (intelligence cooperation, trade facilitation, transport corridors) rather than only status competition.
  - Managing the balance: India’s long‑term approach should be selective — engaging where the SCO advances India’s security and economic objectives (e.g., counterterrorism, Afghanistan stability, regional infrastructure), while maintaining bilateral channels and alternative multilateral platforms (QUAD, BIMSTEC) where SCO dynamics are unfavorable.
  - Stakes in the Gulf outreach: The inclusion of Gulf states as dialogue partners raises issues of energy diplomacy, diaspora welfare, and maritime security. India’s deep economic and people‑to‑people links with the Gulf give it both interest and leverage; India should use SCO tracks to complement, not displace, bilateral Gulf engagements.
  - Incremental pathway: Dialogue partnership is often a stepping‑stone to deeper cooperation (observer status or full membership) for some states. India must monitor which partners might become vectors for strategic realignment in regions contiguous to India’s vital interests.

Conclusion: calibrated engagement in a changing multilateral landscape
The SCO’s dialogue partner category illustrates the organisation’s pragmatic, incremental approach to enlargement and outreach. For India, the category is neither inherently threatening nor automatically advantageous; its significance derives from how member states and external actors deploy it. India’s strategic response should be judicious: use SCO mechanisms where they deliver security or economic dividends, keep alternative multilateral and bilateral options open, and monitor expansion dynamics—especially Gulf and Middle Eastern engagement—for shifts that could affect India’s neighbourhood and its strategic autonomy.

### Guest attendances

Guest attendance at Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summits is an important, if often under-appreciated, instrument of diplomacy. It allows the SCO to widen its diplomatic reach and policy conversations without altering formal membership rolls or the balance of decision-making power. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, understanding who is invited as a guest and why is useful because these invitations shape the forum’s agenda, its external linkages, and the opportunities available to India for regional networking and issue-shaping.

Definition and diplomatic meaning
- Guest attendance is distinct from full membership and from observer status. Guests are formally invited to attend summit- and ministerial-level meetings and to take part in discussions, but they do not possess the rights and obligations that accrue to members or observers (voting, permanent seats on decision-making bodies, or a presumption of future membership).
- As a diplomatic tool, guest invitations achieve several goals: they broaden the organisation’s constituency, create channels for confidence-building, allow testing of closer ties without political commitment, and help the SCO present itself as a hub of inclusive regional cooperation.

Who attends (recent practice)
- The SCO has invited a small number of international organisations and one country to summit-level sessions:
  - Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
  - Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
  - United Nations (UN)
  - Turkmenistan (country guest)
- The presence of ASEAN and the CIS signals the SCO’s desire to engage both Southeast Asian and post‑Soviet regional blocs; the UN’s presence indicates a deliberate interface with global multilateral institutions.

Turkmenistan: a short case study
- Turkmenistan declared and maintains a policy of permanent neutrality; the UN General Assembly recognized this status by resolution in 1995. This legal-political posture is commonly interpreted as constraining Turkmenistan from joining security or defence-oriented blocs.
- Nevertheless, Turkmenistan has pursued selective multilateral engagement:
  - Member of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) since 1992.
  - Became an observer of the Organization of Turkic States in 2021.
  - The head of state of Turkmenistan has attended SCO summits as a guest since 2007.
- The Turkmenistan example illustrates how a formal neutrality declaration can coexist with pragmatic, selective participation in regional fora. While neutrality may be presented as a barrier to full SCO membership, it does not prevent substantive bilateral and multilateral interaction.

Implications for the SCO and for India
- For the SCO:
  - Guest invitations are a low‑cost mechanism for expanding influence and legitimacy across Eurasia without the political and operational complications of enlargement.
  - By engaging ASEAN, the CIS and the UN, the SCO projects itself as both a regional coordinator and a node in broader multilateral networks, enhancing its claim to be a consequential platform for Eurasian governance and security.
- For India’s strategic culture and national security policy:
  - India, as a full SCO member, benefits when the forum brings in actors like ASEAN and the UN: these guests expand issue linkages (trade, connectivity, counterterrorism, multilateral norms) that India can advance within a Eurasian framework complementary to its Act East and neighbourhood policies.
  - Guest participation also creates opportunities for India to pursue bilateral dialogues on the sidelines and to shape regional narratives without precipitating sensitive membership disputes.
  - The Turkmenistan example is instructive: it reveals how states can protect declared strategic constraints (neutrality) while still leveraging multilateral platforms to advance national interests. India’s engagements with guests at SCO meetings thus form part of a broader strategic repertoire—combining institutional diplomacy, bilateral outreach, and issue‑based cooperation—consistent with India’s preference for flexible, non‑zero‑sum regional arrangements.

Conclusion
Guest attendance at SCO summits—embodied by ASEAN, the CIS, the UN and the long-standing participation of Turkmenistan—serves as a pragmatic mechanism for expanding diplomatic outreach, legitimising the organisation, and creating additional channels for cooperation. For India, these guest interactions enlarge the strategic utility of the SCO, offering additional avenues to pursue its regional objectives while respecting the organisation’s careful balance between inclusivity and the political limits of membership.

### Future membership possibilities of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)

The SCO’s enlargement trajectory over the past decade-plus illustrates a deliberate — and politically sensitive — process of widening engagement across Eurasia and beyond. For India, a full member since 2017, potential new entrants and the modalities of accession have direct implications for regional balance, cooperative security priorities, and the organisation’s normative character.

1. Current aspirants and engagement categories
- The SCO uses three principal engagement categories: full member, observer, and dialogue partner. Each confers different rights, obligations and levels of institutional integration.
- Recent statuses and dates (select):
  - Bangladesh — Observer (2012)
  - Syria — Dialogue Partner (2015)
  - Israel — Dialogue Partner (2016)
  - Iraq — Dialogue Partner (2019)
  - Algeria — Observer (July 2023)
  - Laos — Dialogue Partner (2024)
  - Vietnam — publicly expressed interest in observer status (2011) but has not applied
  - Ukraine — expressed interest in observer status (2012); interest stalled after the 2014 Maidan and deteriorating Russia–Ukraine relations
  - Azerbaijan — expectations of observer status reported in MFA comments; Kazakh President Tokayev publicly said Azerbaijan would “probably” become a full member soon (statement, 3 July 2024)
  - Turkey — applied for dialogue partner status in 2011 and obtained it in 2013; Turkish leaders have more recently signalled intent to seek full membership (2022 summit); political statements through 2024 suggest continued interest

2. Institutional and procedural background
- In 2010 the SCO approved a formal procedure for admitting new members; admission requires consensus among existing members. This codified route makes formal enlargement possible but places a high political bar on any accession.
- Observership is frequently used as a stepping stone but is neither a legal nor a political guarantee of full membership. Dialogue partner status is a lighter form of engagement focused on thematic cooperation.

3. Notable country trajectories and political dynamics
- Turkey: Unusual case of cross-alignment — NATO member and EU candidate while pursuing ties with the SCO. Turkey applied for dialogue partner status in 2011 and became a dialogue partner in 2013. Political developments since 2016 (including the European Parliament’s vote to suspend Turkey’s EU accession talks in November 2016) have fed rhetoric about a pivot to Eurasian institutions. Turkey chaired the SCO energy club for 2017 (announced 23 November 2016) despite not being a full member. At the 22nd SCO summit (2022) Turkish leadership declared intent to seek full membership; President Erdoğan reiterated in July 2024 (Newsweek Turkey, 11 July 2024) that NATO is not viewed as an alternative to participation in SCO/BRICS networks. Turkey’s potential accession would complicate the overlap between NATO and SCO memberships and would create new diplomatic and strategic linkages across alliance systems.
- Azerbaijan: Diplomatic signals from Azerbaijani officials and third-party statements (notably Kazakh President Tokayev on 3 July 2024) suggest a possible trajectory toward membership. Given Azerbaijan’s location and contested relationships with Russia and Iran, accession would recalibrate South Caucasus alignments inside the SCO.
- Ukraine and Vietnam: Both signalled early interest (2012 and 2011 respectively); neither converted interest into membership steps. In Ukraine’s case, the change in domestic governance in 2014 and the deepening conflict with Russia removed the political basis for closer SCO integration.
- Other aspirants (Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia): Syria, Israel, Iraq, Algeria, Laos (and others listed above) reflect the SCO’s widening appeal beyond core Central Asia. These engagements are often thematic and low-commitment (dialogue partner), enabling the SCO to expand influence without rapid structural change.

4. Interpretation: what the patterns mean
- The SCO is using a layered engagement strategy: dialogue partners and observers widen the organisation’s footprint while full membership remains constrained by political consensus requirements.
- Enlargement is not merely geographic but strategic: accession of states such as Turkey or Azerbaijan would shift the SCO’s internal balance, bring in states with differing external alignments, and potentially broaden the organisation’s remit beyond its traditional Eurasian security-economy nexus.
- Geopolitical tensions — especially those involving Russia (e.g., Russia–Ukraine) — exert decisive influence on candidates’ calculus and on other members’ willingness to admit them. Leaders’ public statements (Erdoğan, Tokayev) are useful indicators of intent but do not substitute for formal accession steps.

5. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Institutional stakes: The 2010 admission procedure and the requirement for consensus mean India can influence enlargement outcomes. New members will reshape multilateral bargaining settings on security cooperation, connectivity, and counterterrorism — domains of direct interest to India.
- Security and diplomacy: Turkey’s possible elevation to full membership would create a rare institutional overlap with NATO. India must calibrate its diplomacy to avoid being boxed by great-power contestation within the SCO while preserving bilateral ties with potential new members.
- Regional footprint and norms: Expansion into the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia would push the SCO’s perceived mandate from a Eurasian security architecture to a broader geopolitical platform. India should weigh whether wider membership dilutes the organisation’s utility for practical counterterrorism and intelligence cooperation, or whether it creates new spaces for advancing connectivity and trade.
- Political constraints: Aspirations by Ukraine or Azerbaijan underscore that domestic politics and security alignments (especially relations with Russia and China) critically condition accession possibilities. India’s policy should account for how Russia–China dynamics within the SCO affect decision-making on issues where India has core interests (Kashmir, cross-border terrorism, connectivity projects).
- Tactical posture: Observer and dialogue partner statuses provide low-commitment levers for India to engage aspirants and shape norms without needing to expand institutional obligations. India can use these channels to promote transparency, counterterror cooperation, and principles of non-interference and sovereign equality.

6. Practical considerations and recommendations (concise)
- Monitor accession trajectories closely; leverage consensus rule to shape candidates’ commitments on counterterrorism, information sharing and connectivity standards.
- Maintain bilateral outreach to likely entrants (Turkey, Azerbaijan, Algeria, etc.) to ensure India’s security concerns and economic interests are represented in pre-accession dialogues.
- Advocate within the SCO for clear accession criteria tied to constructive behaviour on regional security issues rather than purely geopolitical realignments.
- Prepare contingencies for an SCO with a broader and more heterogeneous membership: strengthen India’s coalitions within the SCO and use other multilateral platforms to hedge where SCO consensus may be lacking.

Conclusion
The SCO’s enlargement pathway — formalised in 2010 and operationalised through a mix of observers, dialogue partners and selective accession — is reshaping Eurasian multilateralism. For India, the strategic challenge is to manage enlargement in ways that preserve the organisation’s practical utility on security cooperation while preventing its co-option into zero-sum great-power competition. Observers and dialogue partners will continue to be valuable diplomatic instruments for both aspirants and existing members; India’s response should be calibrated, proactive and informed by an understanding of how domestic politics and external alliances condition accession possibilities.

### The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the Securitization of Eurasia

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), by 2023, had become primarily a security-centred regional architecture. Originally conceived as a confidence‑building forum, its agenda has evolved into a broad security remit that reaches beyond classical counter‑terrorism to encompass drugs, trafficking, cyber and informational operations. This evolution has significant implications for member states’ law‑enforcement practices, regional power balances and for external actors such as India, whose strategic culture prizes sovereignty, non‑interference and calibrated multilateral engagement.

#### Institutional mechanism: RATS and its role
- At the Tashkent summit (16–17 June 2004) the SCO established the Regional Anti‑Terrorist Structure (RATS) as the organisation’s dedicated counterterrorism body. RATS is the institutional locus for intelligence‑sharing, coordination of investigations, maintenance of lists and facilitation of joint operations.
- RATS’ remit includes information exchange on terrorist groups and suspects, operational coordination, and capacity‑building among law enforcement and security services.
- In practice, RATS has been credited with tangible results: reporting (e.g., press accounts in 2017) attributes to it the foiling of hundreds of plots and the extradition of suspects. Such outputs signal both active cooperation and the operationalization of SCO mechanisms.

#### Expansion of the security agenda: drugs, trafficking and information operations
- From 2006 the SCO explicitly framed transnational drug crimes within its counter‑terrorism architecture: on 21 April 2006 members announced coordinated measures to combat cross‑border drug crimes under a counter‑terrorism framework. This represents a functional broadening from terrorism to organized crime with security implications.
- The organisation has addressed human‑trafficking and weapons trafficking as part of its security remit, acknowledging the interdependence of criminal economies and violent instability in Central and South Asia.
- The SCO has produced counterterrorist instruments such as blacklists and extradition arrangements, codifying member cooperation on suspects and networks.
- By 2010 the SCO publicly opposed forms of cyberwarfare and, earlier (2009), an accord defined “information war” in terms that included a state’s attempt to undermine another state’s political, economic and social systems. This language marks the securitization of information flows and cyberspace within SCO doctrine.

#### Operational cooperation and exercises
- The SCO has sought interoperability through joint exercises and cooperation with parallel Eurasian security bodies. In October 2007 an agreement with the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) in Dushanbe aimed to expand cooperation on security, crime and drug trafficking — an example of convergent Eurasian security architectures, many of which are Russia‑centred.
- The 36th meeting of RATS decided on a joint anti‑terror exercise, Pabbi‑Antiterror‑2021, scheduled in Pakistan — illustrative of practical, on‑the‑ground interoperability and the role of exercises in building common procedures and mutual trust.

#### Practices, risks and normative tensions
- Instruments such as blacklists, extradition processes and intelligence sharing have increased the operational capacity of member states to pursue cross‑border threats. At the same time, these tools raise familiar concerns: potential politicization of lists, differing due‑process standards across members, and the risk that counterterrorism mechanisms may be used to target political opponents under the guise of security.
- The explicit framing of information dissemination as a security threat enables member states to justify stricter controls over media and cyberspace. Such securitization can be expected to generate tensions with norms of free information flow and may complicate relations with external democracies and international civil‑society actors.

#### Geopolitical consequences and institutional evolution
- The SCO’s security orientation links it more closely to regional power dynamics. Cooperation with the CSTO, the growing role of Russia and China within SCO processes, and the political profile of member capitals have shaped the organisation’s posture.
- Membership shifts affect balance: for example, Iran’s accession (formalised in 2023) introduces new strategic vectors and domestic security concerns into SCO deliberations, and may alter consensus dynamics among major members.
- At the July 2024 summit in Astana the SCO issued a call for a fair, multipolar world order anchored in the United Nations and international law and grounded in sovereign, mutually beneficial partnerships. This declaratory posture aligns with member states’ shared preference for reduced Western hegemony and greater strategic autonomy.

#### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s entry into the SCO as a full member (2017) requires a calibrated approach. The organisation offers concrete advantages: access to RATS’ intelligence channels, platforms for coordinated counterterrorism action, opportunities for joint exercises, and a multilateral venue to address cross‑border crime that affects India’s neighbourhood.
- Nevertheless, benefits are tempered by risks:
  - Political dynamics within the SCO (notably China–Pakistan cooperation and Russia’s pull) can limit New Delhi’s ability to shape agendas and may produce outcomes that do not align with Indian priorities.
  - Reliance on extradition and blacklist mechanisms raises concerns about opaque standards and potential misuse; India must safeguard legal protections and insist on transparent, rule‑based cooperation.
  - The securitization of information and endorsement of counter‑cyber narratives could justify restrictive information policies among members, complicating India’s own digital freedoms agenda and its global advocacy for an open, secure cyberspace.
- Strategic posture recommended for India:
  - Pragmatic engagement: use RATS and other SCO mechanisms to pursue concrete counterterrorism and counter‑trafficking objectives while remaining alert to politicization.
  - Protect legal safeguards: push for clear procedural standards for extradition, evidence sharing and the treatment of suspects, and seek greater transparency in blacklist criteria.
  - Advance norms: advocate within the SCO for a balanced approach to information security—one that counters malicious cyber operations but does not become a pretext for undue restrictions.
  - Leverage multipolar rhetoric: align India’s call for rule‑based multipolarity with the SCO’s 2024 declarations to promote an international order that recognises sovereign equality while also protecting individual rights and rule‑of‑law principles.

#### Mapping the evolution: key moments
- 2004 (Tashkent): Creation of RATS — institutionalisation of SCO counterterrorism.
- 2006 (April): SCO places cross‑border drug crime under counterterrorism framework.
- 2007 (October): Agreement with CSTO in Dushanbe — institutional coordination on security and trafficking.
- 2009–2010: Definition and public opposition to “information war” and cyberwarfare — expansion into information security.
- 2017: Reporting on RATS’ operational successes (hundreds of foiled plots; large‑scale extraditions) — operational maturity.
- 2021: Decision to hold Pabbi‑Antiterror exercise — continued emphasis on interoperability.
- 2023: Iran’s accession — membership shift altering internal dynamics.
- 2024 (Astana): Call for a fair multipolar world — declaratory alignment with member states’ strategic preferences.

Conclusion
The SCO’s trajectory from confidence‑building to a comprehensive security organisation mirrors broader shifts in Eurasian geopolitics: a move toward cooperative security mechanisms that are operationally robust but normatively contested. For India, the SCO is neither a panacea nor a threat in itself; rather, it is a platform whose instruments—RATS, joint exercises, and expanded security lexicon—must be engaged with strategically. Preserving India’s norms of sovereignty, due process and a free information order while extracting operational benefits will require careful diplomacy, legal safeguards and persistent norm‑shaping within the SCO.

1. The SCO’s military trajectory: expansion without alliance
- From its origins as a forum for confidence-building in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) incrementally deepened security cooperation. By 2009 its activities encompassed increased military cooperation, routine intelligence-sharing and coordinated counterterrorism initiatives. Member leaders, however, repeatedly insisted that the SCO was not—and would not become—a formal military alliance. This dual messaging (de facto deepening of security ties; de jure denial of alliance status) has characterised the organisation’s security profile.
- Empirically, this deepening took the form of regular joint exercises, institutionalised counterterrorism work through the Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in Tashkent, and more frequent operational planning at ministerial and military staff levels. Yet, as of 2023 the SCO had not provided collective military support in a member-state conflict; there is no recorded case of an SCO-enabled collective combat intervention.

2. Chronology and character of joint exercises
- The SCO’s joint military exercises began in 2003, with the initial phase hosted in Kazakhstan and subsequent phases in China. These early drills established a pattern of geographically rotating large-scale manoeuvres concentrated in Russia, China and Central Asia—locations reflecting the logistical capacities and strategic priorities of the organisation’s leading members.
- Between 2005 and 2009 the Beijing–Moscow axis used the SCO framework to mount significant bilateral and multilateral war games: Peace Mission 2005, Peace Mission 2007 and Peace Mission 2009. Peace Mission 2007 (agreed at the April 2006 SCO defence ministers’ meeting) involved over 4,000 troops and was held in Chelyabinsk, Russia, close to the Ural Mountains—an exercise notable for its scale and for the presence of top SCO political leaders.
- Peace Mission 2010 (9–25 September, Matybulak training area, Kazakhstan) again displayed expanded participation: more than 5,000 personnel from China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan engaged in joint planning and operational manoeuvres. By 2017 the pattern had become regular: periodic multilateral exercises framed explicitly as counterterrorism and stability-oriented drills, but with capabilities useful for a broader range of military tasks.

3. Operational transparency, signalling and rhetoric
- SCO leaders and defence officials have publicly emphasised transparency. In 2010, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov stated that exercises would be open to media and the public—an effort to temper alarm in neighbouring states and the wider international community. Nonetheless, transparency often coexists with deliberate strategic messaging: the exercises are simultaneously practical interoperability efforts and displays of political-military resolve.
- The SCO has also been used as a stage for broader strategic announcements. A telling example: during the 2007 Russian exercises attended by SCO leaders, President Vladimir Putin announced the resumption of regular strategic-bomber patrols—framed as a restoration of operational readiness. Such announcements use the SCO’s multilateral visibility to amplify national signaling.

4. Institutional attributes and legal limits
- The SCO’s core security instrument is RATS, charged with counterterrorism cooperation and intelligence exchange. The organisation’s membership (as relevant to military exercises) includes China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan; India and Pakistan became full members in 2017, broadening the SCO’s South Asian footprint.
- Crucially, the SCO lacks a collective-defense clause analogous to NATO’s Article 5. There is no binding legal obligation for collective military intervention, and no single command structure to translate exercises directly into coalition combat operations. This legal lacuna constrains any institutional progression from cooperative drills to a formalised mutual-defense pact.

5. Proposals for deeper integration and political constraints
- On occasion, actors within the SCO policy space have proposed more ambitious institutional linkages. In June 2014 (Dushanbe) the idea of closer integration, including proposals to merge the SCO with the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), was mooted. Such proposals confront immediate political, legal and sovereignty hurdles: the CSTO’s Russia-led defence-pact character and differing memberships and objectives make merger complex and politically sensitive.
- After the 2007–2010 war games, Russian officials even floated the possibility of inviting India to future exercises—an idea tied to Russia’s interest in expanding interoperability and influence within a larger Eurasian security architecture. India, however, has historically balanced an interest in practical cooperation with a doctrine of strategic autonomy, which shapes how New Delhi approaches invitations to deeper security integration.

6. Geopolitical shocks and the limits of cohesion (2014–2022)
- Geopolitical shocks have exposed the SCO’s limits as a military bloc. Proposals for tighter integration with the CSTO in 2014 foundered on competing objectives within the region. The most consequential shock was Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Following the invasion, by late 2022 many SCO members—and several CSTO members—took steps to distance themselves from overt military cooperation with Russia. Economic ties, political caution, and the fear of secondary sanctions or destabilisation constrained members’ willingness to deepen security dependence on Moscow.
- These developments reinforced an existing pattern: while leading members can use the SCO to project influence and rehearse joint operations, the organisation remains vulnerable to divergent member interests and external pressures.

7. Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- India’s accession as a full SCO member in 2017 has both practical and symbolic significance. Participation in SCO exercises and counterterrorism mechanisms offers India opportunities for intelligence exchange, situational awareness in Central Asia, and calibrated defence cooperation with regional powers. Yet India’s strategic culture—prioritising non-alignment/strategic autonomy and cautious hedging between great powers—means New Delhi is wary of binding security commitments that could compromise independent action.
- For Indian policymakers, the SCO provides a venue to balance competing imperatives: to engage with China and Russia on counterterrorism and regional stability while avoiding entanglement in partnership architectures that might constrain New Delhi’s strategic choices. The SCO’s lack of a collective-defense clause, its signalling role, and the demonstrated limits to cohesion after 2022 all reinforce an Indian preference for selective, issue-based engagement rather than membership in a bloc-like military collective.

Conclusion: a pragmatic security forum, not a military bloc
- The SCO has incrementally deepened military cooperation—through exercises, intelligence-sharing, and RATS-led counterterrorism work—yet it has not evolved into a formal military alliance capable of collective combat operations as of 2023. Large-scale exercises have been used both to improve interoperability and to signal influence, especially by Russia and China. But divergent member interests, the absence of binding legal obligations for collective defense, and geopolitical shocks (notably the 2022 Ukraine war) constrain institutionalisation. For India, the SCO is a useful instrument of engagement and signalling, compatible with its strategic autonomy, but not a substitute for bilateral or other multilateral security arrangements that New Delhi views as more reliable for its defense needs.

## Chapter excerpt: Shanghai Cooperation Organisation — Economic Cooperation, Institutional Proposals, and Implications for India

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has evolved from an initially security- and confidence‑building body into an arena for economic cooperation, institutional innovation, and competing visions of regional governance. For India — a full SCO member since 2017 — these economic strands present both opportunities for connectivity, trade and energy access, and strategic challenges that touch on financial sovereignty, institutional competition, and alignment with other multilateral projects. The following section synthesises the major economic initiatives, proposals and events within the SCO (2003–2022), assesses their practical significance, and highlights the specific policy considerations they raise for India’s strategic culture and national security policy.

Chronology of major economic initiatives and proposals (selected)
- September 2003: SCO member states signed a Framework Agreement aimed at enhancing economic cooperation across the region. That agreement marked a shift from declaratory security language toward more explicit economic objectives.
- September 2003: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao articulated a long‑term objective to establish an SCO free trade area, while urging nearer‑term measures to improve the flow of goods in the region. Wen’s proposal signalled China’s early interest in linking SCO political cooperation to trade liberalisation and connectivity.
- 23 September 2004: Members endorsed a follow‑up plan that contained 100 specific actions to operationalise the economic goals of the 2003 framework — an indication of intent to translate broad goals into concrete measures.
- October 2005 (Moscow Summit): The SCO elevated energy cooperation as a priority. Summit decisions emphasised joint oil and gas projects, exploration of hydrocarbon reserves, and cooperative use of water resources — reflecting the complementarities among members (Central Asian energy, Russian technology and reserves, Chinese capital and demand).
- October 2005: The creation of an SCO Interbank Consortium was agreed as a vehicle to fund future joint projects.
- February 2006: The first meeting of the SCO Interbank Association took place in Beijing, a step toward institutionalising regional finance mechanisms.
- November 2006 (Almaty conference): A Russian representative publicly announced plans for an SCO “Energy Club” intended to coordinate member energy policies.
- November 2007 (Moscow Summit): Russia reiterated the energy‑club proposal; however, other SCO members refrained from committing to the idea, and the proposal did not materialise into a formal SCO body.
- 2007 SCO Summit (reported): Iranian Vice‑President Parviz Davoodi proposed using the SCO as a forum to design an independent banking system separate from existing international banking institutions (this proposal has been flagged in source materials as requiring better verification).
- 2008 summit statement (text flagged as requiring verification in some source compilations): Communiqué language reportedly stressed responsible currency and financial policy, capital‑flow controls where necessary, and ensuring food and energy security in the face of slower global growth.
- June 2009 (Yekaterinburg Summit): China announced a US$10 billion loan facility intended to assist SCO members hit by the 2008 financial crisis — a concrete demonstration of China’s role as a regional stabiliser and financier.
- 2009 summit context: The SCO summit coincided with the first BRIC leaders’ meeting; China–Russia joint statements at that time called for a larger IMF quota for emerging markets, signalling shared interest in reforming global financial governance.
- 2014: The founding of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) — with Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan among its members — created an overlapping regional economic project that both competes and could complement SCO initiatives.
- 2019 Bishkek Summit: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan proposed increasing intra‑SCO trade in local currencies instead of the US dollar and advocated for SCO financial institutions, including a possible SCO bank.
- June 2022: Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Diplomacy, Mehdi Safari, publicly proposed the creation of a single SCO currency to streamline intra‑SCO trade and transactions.
- 19–22 October 2022: Iran hosted SCOCOEX, a dedicated conference and exhibition focused on economic cooperation opportunities among SCO members — an example of growing civil‑economic engagement under SCO auspices.
- SCO soft‑power initiative: The SCO established SCO University, a student exchange and academic collaboration programme intended to develop human capital and create institutional linkages across member states.

Thematic analysis

1. From declaratory agreements to action plans, but mixed implementation
The 2004 “100‑action” plan demonstrates an early willingness to move from high‑level commitments to specific deliverables. In practice, however, outcomes have been uneven. Concrete actions — such as China’s 2009 loan and the interbank meetings — show capacity to mobilise regional finance; more ambitious institutional proposals (e.g., an SCO energy club, an SCO bank, or a single currency) have struggled to gain unanimous member buy‑in. This reflects classic multilateral implementation challenges: differences in national priorities, uneven administrative capacity, and competing external linkages.

2. Energy cooperation: natural complementarities, political constraints
Energy cooperation is the most logically grounded domain for SCO economic integration. Central Asian hydrocarbon resources, Russian reserves and technology, and Chinese capital and demand form a complementary matrix. Yet coordination has been constrained by divergent national strategies, commercial competition, pipeline geopolitics, and Russia’s and China’s differing visions for regional architecture. The repeated Russian proposal for an “energy club” illustrates intent but also the difficulty of moving from proposal to binding mechanism without consensus.

3. Regional financial mechanisms and alternative governance
Interbank mechanisms — the SCO Interbank Consortium/Association — were designed to provide regional financing for projects and to reduce dependence on Western financial sources. China’s US$10 billion 2009 loan exemplifies the practical capacity of a major member to act as lender of regional last resort. Proposals from Russia and Iran to create an independent banking system, an SCO bank, or even a single currency reflect strategic concerns about dollar dominance, sanctions exposure, and the desire for greater financial autonomy. These ideas face substantial technical, legal and political hurdles (monetary policy coordination, currency convertibility and trust in institutions), but they signal a strategic impulse among some members to explore alternatives to existing international financial architectures.

4. Currency ideas: practical impulse, technical and political complexity
Proposals to promote trade in local currencies — advanced at various times by Pakistan, Iran and others — and Iran’s 2022 proposal for a single SCO currency respond to real vulnerabilities (exchange‑rate risk, sanctions risk, and dollar dependency). Yet a single currency or tightly coordinated currency system requires deep integration (fiscal and monetary convergence, lender‑of‑last‑resort arrangements, dispute‑settlement mechanisms) that SCO members are not currently prepared to accept. Incremental steps (currency swap lines, local‑currency settlement mechanisms) are more feasible and already being used in bilateral and sub‑regional contexts.

5. Overlap with other regional institutions: competition and complementarity
The emergence of the EAEU, BRICS, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the New Development Bank (NDB) creates a dense institutional environment. Overlap can produce synergies (financing through AIIB/NDB for SCO‑backed projects) but also risks duplication, competition for member attention and resources, and strategic divergence (for example, the EAEU’s deeper economic integration model contrasts with the SCO’s historically looser, consensus based approach). For India, navigating these overlapping architectures is part of a broader strategic balancing exercise.

6. Soft power and long‑term integration: SCO University
SCO University and student exchange programmes are low‑politics, high‑returns instruments for building social capital and institutional networks. For India, participation in such initiatives helps build people‑to‑people ties, promotes mutual understanding, and creates professional linkages that support long‑term cooperation without immediate sovereignty costs.

Caveats on sources and unverified claims
Some items reported in open‑source compilations require cautious treatment. Proposals such as Iran’s 2007 plan for an independent SCO banking system and certain 2008 summit communiqué texts have been flagged in primary summaries as needing verification. Russia’s rhetoric about combating “monopoly” in world finance (often attributed to President Vladimir Putin in summit contexts) should be understood as indicative of political posture rather than a detailed financial blueprint. Careful cross‑checking against SCO summit communiqués, official foreign‑ministry releases, and primary meeting records is necessary when using these claims as the basis for policy decisions or scholarly argument.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

Opportunities
- Economic diversification and connectivity: SCO initiatives — particularly in trade facilitation, energy and infrastructure — can broaden India’s access to Central Asian markets and resources, complementing India’s westward connectivity aims (e.g., International North–South Transport Corridor concepts).
- Multilateral leverage: Active engagement enables India to shape the institutional agenda (transparency, dispute resolution, project selection), preventing the SCO from becoming solely a theatre for China–Russia agenda setting.
- Soft‑power gains: Participation in SCO University and civil economic forums supports long‑term influence-building among elites and professionals across Eurasia.

Risks and constraints
- Being sidelined on financial architecture: Proposals for SCO financial institutions or currency mechanisms advanced by other members could marginalise India if it does not assert its preferences (especially on governance standards and reserve currency policies).
- Exposure to overlapping projects: The EAEU and other Russia‑led initiatives may produce integration models that do not align with India’s economic norms, complicating coordination with SCO economic plans.
- Strategic divergence within SCO: China’s large economic weight and Russia’s Eurasian priorities may push the SCO toward architectures that serve their interests first; India must balance cooperation with strategic autonomy.

Policy recommendations (concise)
- Engage pragmatically: India should continue constructive participation in SCO economic working groups, pushing for transparency, project feasibility studies, and commercially driven cooperation rather than politicised institutions.
- Protect financial sovereignty: India should oppose any rushed moves toward a single currency or centralised SCO banking without rigorous legal, fiscal and monetary convergence frameworks; instead, advocate for incremental local‑currency settlement arrangements and carefully designed swap lines.
- Leverage soft power: Expand academic and professional exchanges under SCO University to build long‑term influence and create networks that facilitate project implementation.
- Coordinate across architectures: Ensure policy coherence between India’s SCO engagement and its positions in other multilateral settings (BRICS, AIIB, bilateral ties with Central Asian states) to avoid strategic contradictions.
- Demand verifiability and governance: Condition support for regional financing instruments on transparent governance, independent audits and clear dispute‑resolution mechanisms.

Concluding assessment
The SCO’s economic agenda embodies an ambition to translate regional complementarities into practical cooperation. While some concrete steps have been taken (interbank meetings, China’s crisis loan, energy project discussions, and people‑to‑people exchanges), major institutional innovations — an SCO energy club, a dedicated SCO bank, or a single SCO currency — remain politically contested and technically challenging. For India, the SCO offers a pragmatic platform for extending influence into Eurasia, but engagement must be guided by India’s strategic culture: a preference for calibrated multilateralism, institutional safeguards, and an insistence on project viability and sovereign discretion. Where proposals in the public record lack reliable sourcing, Indian policymakers — and scholars — should demand primary documentation and treat such claims as indicative rather than definitive.

## Cultural Diplomacy in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation: Institutionalization and Strategic Implications (2002–2008)

Between 2002 and 2008 the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) moved deliberately to institutionalize a distinct cultural track alongside its well‑known security and economic agendas. The record of ministerial meetings and events in this period — though incomplete in public sources — demonstrates both the mechanisms deployed to operationalize cultural cooperation and the strategic logic that underpins them.

### Key events and chronology
- 12 April 2002, Beijing: the SCO’s culture ministers met for the first time. At this inaugural meeting they signed a joint statement committing member states to continued cultural cooperation. This event established a formal ministerial interlocutor for cultural affairs within the SCO architecture.
- 27–28 April 2006, Tashkent: the third meeting of SCO Culture Ministers was convened in Uzbekistan, demonstrating that ministerial exchanges had become a repeating modality for managing the cultural agenda.
- 2005, Astana Summit: an SCO Arts Festival and Exhibition was organized for the first time at the Astana summit, marking the elevation of cultural programming from declaratory commitments to tangible people‑to‑people events within the summit cycle.
- 2008 proposal, Astana: Kazakhstan proposed holding an SCO folk dance festival in Astana in 2008, signaling proactive member‑state initiative in shaping the cultural calendar and format.

Notably, the available textual trace omits mention of the second culture ministers’ meeting (date/location), leaving a gap in the chronological record that points to incomplete archival consolidation or selective reporting in SCO public materials.

### Mechanisms and functional logic
The SCO deployed two primary instruments to advance cultural cooperation:
1. Regular ministerial meetings — institutional mechanisms to set policy, agree joint statements, and coordinate future activities.
2. Cultural events — arts festivals, exhibitions, and proposed folk‑dance festivals that translate policy into visible, performative diplomacy.

These mechanisms serve complementary functions: ministerial fora produce continuity, mandates, and planning; festivals and exhibitions operationalize those mandates in ways that reach broader publics.

### Cultural initiatives as soft power and people‑to‑people diplomacy
Cultural festivals and exhibitions are not peripheral to regional strategy; they are deliberate instruments of soft power. Within the SCO context they:
- Create shared symbolic spaces where narratives of regional identity and inter‑state cooperation can be rehearsed and normalized.
- Build interpersonal networks among artists, cultural officials, educators and youth that can outlast political fluctuations at the interstate level.
- Provide an apolitical veneer for deeper engagement — facilitating contacts and mutual familiarity that reduce misperception and create constituencies for cooperation.

For states seeking influence within a multilateral framework, hosting and designing high‑visibility cultural events is a tool for agenda‑setting and image management.

### Member engagement and leadership dynamics
The record shows active member‑state engagement in the cultural track. Kazakhstan’s hosting of the 2005 arts festival and its 2008 proposal for a folk‑dance festival illustrate how midsize members can use cultural diplomacy to assert leadership, shape the SCO’s public profile, and leverage soft‑power dividends. Hosting responsibilities thus become a vector of status and agenda control within the organisation.

### Gaps, record‑keeping and implications for research
The missing reference to the second ministerial meeting underscores a broader problem for analysts: inconsistent documentation of the SCO’s cultural track impedes longitudinal study. Researchers and policy planners should treat the extant public record cautiously and press for fuller, regularly updated archival disclosure to map institutional development accurately.

### Strategic implications for India
Although India became a full SCO member only in 2017, the patterns established in 2002–2008 are instructive for Indian strategic culture and national security policy:
- Cultural diplomacy is a low‑cost, high‑leverage instrument that complements hard security measures. For India, participating actively in the SCO cultural track provides an avenue to project its civilisational narrative, connect with diasporic and cultural communities across Central Asia, and counterbalance rival narratives.
- Engagement through festivals, artist exchanges, and youth programs can create constituencies of influence that contribute to long‑term regional stability and goodwill — important when hard security cooperation is limited or episodic.
- India should be mindful of the dual‑use nature of cultural platforms: while they foster mutual understanding, they can also be instrumentalised by other powers for influence operations. Cultural initiatives must be integrated with a coherent communications and strategic outreach plan that preserves cultural autonomy while advancing national interests.
- Finally, India can use hosting opportunities and event design to signal leadership on norms (e.g., heritage preservation, interfaith dialogue), thereby shaping regional soft‑power regimes without securitising culture.

### Recommendations
- Institutionalise regular ministerial cycles for culture within the SCO and ensure transparent, accessible records so that policy continuity is visible and researchable.
- Fill chronological and archival gaps in SCO cultural documentation to enable more reliable analysis and planning.
- Diversify event formats beyond festivals and exhibitions to include artist residencies, scholar exchanges, youth leadership programs, and joint heritage projects — modalities that deepen ties and create durable networks.
- For India specifically: treat cultural diplomacy as a strategic complement to security policy — engage actively in SCO cultural programming, propose formats that highlight India’s comparative strengths (classical arts, film, education), and design monitoring mechanisms to maintain strategic clarity.

Conclusion
The SCO’s early cultural track (2002–2008) exemplifies how multilateral organisations institutionalise soft‑power tools through ministerial mechanisms and public events. For India’s strategic culture, such mechanisms offer pragmatic avenues to build influence, manage regional narratives, and strengthen people‑to‑people linkages that underpin long‑term stability. Robust documentation, diversified programming, and coordination with broader national strategy are essential if cultural diplomacy is to translate into durable strategic advantage.

### The SCO+ Inter‑Party Forum: Origins, Composition and Strategic Significance

Background and origin
- The SCO+ forum format was launched by United Russia in October 2020. As an initiative originating in Russia’s dominant ruling party, the format carries implications beyond a mere civil society experiment: it has the implicit backing of state-aligned political power and is therefore a deliberate instrument of outreach and influence.
- United Russia framed the new format as an inter‑party extension to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). By creating an “SCO+” layer, the initiative deliberately moved party‑level diplomacy into a space that parallels — but does not replace — formal intergovernmental SCO mechanisms.

Composition and institutional design
- SCO+ is organised as an inter‑party forum that reaches beyond the SCO’s formal membership. It invites party delegations from:
  - SCO member states (the core SCO membership includes China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, India and Pakistan),
  - SCO observers and candidate states,
  - Parties from Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries,
  - Parties associated with BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) and other friendly or aligned political formations.
- The format therefore blends regional post‑Soviet networks (CIS), Eurasian multilateralism (SCO), and the wider Global South club represented by BRICS. This deliberately broad composition extends the forum’s geopolitical reach beyond the SCO’s conventional geography.

The inaugural forum: “Economy for People”, 22–23 October 2020
- United Russia’s first international inter‑party forum under the SCO+ banner took place on 22–23 October 2020 under the theme “Economy for People.”
- Participants and reach:
  - Speaker delegations represented some 25 countries, including governmental ministers from SCO countries, heads of political parties, and diplomatic representatives.
  - Notable attendees included Dmitry Medvedev (then chairman of United Russia), ministers from SCO states, Serbia’s President Aleksandar Vučić, and a range of ambassadors and diplomats from CIS and BRICS states.
  - Russian President Vladimir Putin conveyed formal greetings to participants. Such high‑level messages from the presidential level provide political legitimation and signal that the forum aligns with broader Russian foreign‑policy objectives.

Political logic and messaging
- The theme “Economy for People” uses a socio‑economic and populist framing to broaden appeal. Framing the forum in these terms helps domestic sell‑in (it resonates with electorates concerned about livelihoods) and makes party‑to‑party engagement appear less overtly geopolitical and more policy‑oriented.
- Including a European actor such as Serbia demonstrates a conscious outreach beyond the traditional SCO geography. That signals attempts to cultivate influence in parts of Europe through party channels rather than solely state‑to‑state diplomacy.

Strategic effects and functions
- Parallel diplomatic channel: SCO+ institutionalises an inter‑party track that complements state diplomacy. These party networks can maintain dialogue when official relations are strained, and they can prospectively shape political elites’ perceptions across borders.
- Soft‑power and influence building: By convening parties from different regions under shared themes, organisers can propagate narratives, policy models, and normative preferences compatible with their foreign‑policy outlook.
- Network institutionalisation: Regularised inter‑party fora create durable channels for coordination, exchange of best practices, and potentially coordinated political messaging across national parties.
- Geopolitical ampliation: Combining SCO, BRICS and CIS party actors increases the potential to create transregional alignments of parties sympathetic to particular strategic positions, thereby supplementing state‑level coalitions.

Risks, legal questions and normative issues
- Blurring state and party diplomacy: When ruling parties convene international forums with quasi‑official backing, it can erode clarity between the conduct of state diplomacy (the prerogative of governments and foreign ministries) and party politics. This raises questions about accountability and democratic oversight.
- Domestic and international pushback: Countries or parties wary of external political influence may resist engagement, and legal frameworks vary on what foreign party cooperation is permissible or reportable.
- Legal/status recognition: The international status of party fora differs widely. They are not formal treaty bodies, so outcomes have informal rather than binding force, yet their political consequences can be significant. In some domestic legal systems, cross‑border party cooperation touches rules on foreign funding, transparency or electoral law.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India is an SCO founding member; consequently, developments in SCO‑adjacent venues — including SCO+ — bear directly on the strategic environment India navigates. Party‑to‑party engagement of this nature presents both opportunities and hazards within India’s strategic culture, which values strategic autonomy and the primacy of state diplomacy.
- Opportunities:
  - Indian parties can use inter‑party channels to exchange policy ideas on socio‑economic governance, trade, and regional cooperation while maintaining official foreign‑policy positions.
  - Such forums may offer low‑risk avenues for confidence building with neighbouring parties during periods of bilateral tension.
- Hazards and responses:
  - The institutionalisation of party diplomacy by parties closely aligned with a foreign state (in this case, United Russia) could become a vector for influence that runs at cross‑purposes with India’s national interest if not carefully managed.
  - India’s strategic culture emphasises civilian control of foreign policy; accordingly, New Delhi is likely to be cautious about allowing party foreign ties to translate into parallel foreign‑policy commitments.
  - Policy safeguards: Indian authorities and political parties may need clearer internal guidelines on external party engagements (transparency, reporting, and limits), alongside reaffirmation of the Ministry of External Affairs’ primacy in official diplomacy.
  - Selective engagement: India can choose to participate selectively — engaging on technical or socio‑economic themes while avoiding entanglement in coordinated political messaging that could compromise strategic autonomy.

Conclusion
The SCO+ initiative illustrates a deliberate effort to expand the multilateral field beyond official state institutions into party networks, combining SCO, CIS and BRICS linkages under a populist socio‑economic banner. For India, the development is strategically salient. It provides new avenues for cross‑border political engagement and policy exchange but also poses governance and national‑security questions about the boundaries between party activity and state diplomacy. India's response will need to align with its broader strategic culture: preserving autonomy, ensuring transparency, and using such channels opportunistically without ceding the conduct of foreign policy to non‑state political actors.

## SCO Summit Protocols and Implications for India’s Strategic Posture

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) codifies a compact procedural rhythm that governs when, where and how its principal decision-making bodies meet. For a middle power with a complex security environment like India, those procedural rules are not mere formality: they structure diplomatic timetables, determine hosting opportunities and constraints, create predictable windows for policy coordination, and embed subtle linguistic and normative influences into the organisation’s practice.

### Institutional requirements and ceremony

- Annual summit of the Council of Heads of State: The SCO Charter requires that the heads of state of member countries meet once every year. These summits are the organisation’s apex political event and are the primary forum for major declarations, strategic signalling and leader-level bargaining.

- Venue rotation and ordering: Summits are held at alternating venues each year. Crucially, the order of hosts follows the alphabetical order of member states’ names in Russian. This procedural detail—seemingly technical—reflects the organisation’s institutional history and the continuing salience of Russian language practice within SCO protocols.

Implication: The predictable rotation and the use of Russian alphabetical ordering give each member an equal, scheduled opportunity to host while also exposing the organisation to linguistic and symbolic practices that reflect Russia’s long-standing influence in the institutional culture of the SCO.

### Associated councils and timetable mechanics

- Council of Heads of Government (Prime Ministers): The Charter requires an annual meeting of heads of government. Unlike the strictly ordered heads-of-state summit rotation, the Prime Ministers’ meeting is held at a place decided by the council members themselves. Functionally, this council is the locus of policy and economic coordination—working through technical and programmatic issues that do not require head-of-state attention.

- Council of Foreign Ministers: This council is scheduled to meet approximately one month before the annual heads-of-state summit. Its role is explicitly preparatory: to set the summit agenda, resolve technical positions, negotiate joint texts and align diplomatic positions in advance of leader-level decisions.

- Extraordinary meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers: Any two member states may call an extraordinary meeting of foreign ministers. This rule gives the organisation procedural flexibility to respond to urgent developments without waiting for the annual cycle.

Implication: These interlocking timetables (FM meeting → heads-of-state summit; annual PM meeting) create a predictable workflow for agenda-setting and decision preparation, while the “two-member” trigger for extraordinary foreign ministerial meetings provides a low-threshold mechanism for rapid response or agenda initiative.

### How these rules shape India’s strategic practice

- Calendar discipline and high-level planning: The predictable, annual rhythm forces New Delhi to align domestic political calendars (e.g., elections, parliamentary sessions) and diplomatic preparations to SCO deadlines. When India is slated to host, the rotation provides a planning horizon for logistical, security and public diplomacy preparation but also creates a hard obligation to be ready in the year assigned.

- Agenda-shaping through the foreign ministers’ window: Because the Council of Foreign Ministers meets about a month before the leaders’ summit as a preparatory forum, India’s foreign service must prioritise pre-summit diplomacy at the FM level to iron out technical disagreements, secure consensus on joint statements, and build coalitions. The FM meeting is where detailed compromises are struck that will appear as leader-level outcomes.

- Tactical use of the extraordinary FM mechanism: The ability for two members to convene an extraordinary foreign ministers’ meeting is strategically valuable. India can either call for such a meeting (in partnership with another member) to highlight urgent regional security issues—terrorism, transnational crime, or a cross-border incident—or resist attempts by other members to use the mechanism to steer the agenda away from Indian priorities. The low threshold lowers transaction costs for coalition-led agenda-setting.

- Economic and policy coordination distinct from ceremonial diplomacy: The annual Prime Ministerial council is the place where policy instruments and economic cooperation are negotiated in detail. For India, PM-level engagement is where substantive trade, connectivity and counterterrorism projects are crafted, separate from the more symbolic and strategic pronouncements of heads-of-state summits.

- Symbolic and linguistic politics: The prescribed use of Russian alphabetical order for summit rotation is more than administrative quirk; it is a signal of continued Russian procedural primacy in SCO practice. India’s diplomats should be attuned to these symbolic dimensions: language choices, protocol arrangements and institutional habits can convey underlying power relations and affect perceptions of equity and influence.

- Operational burdens and opportunity costs of hosting: Hosting a heads-of-state summit or PM meeting entails substantial security, logistical and political costs but also offers diplomatic dividends—high-visibility agenda-setting, bilateral sideline meetings, and public diplomacy gains. India must weigh these costs against the institutional and strategic benefits when it prepares for its scheduled hosting year.

### Practical recommendations for Indian policymakers

- Treat the FM meeting as the decisive preparatory forum: Prioritise robust pre-meeting negotiations and coalition-building at the foreign minister level to secure clear, technical language and avoid last-minute summit surprises.

- Use the extraordinary FM mechanism selectively: Form tactical partnerships with fellow members to convene meetings on priority security issues when rapid multilateral response is needed, but manage the risk of others using the mechanism to reframe agendas.

- Prepare early for hosting years: Begin interministerial security, logistics and messaging planning well before the scheduled host year to convert hosting into strategic leverage rather than a logistical burden.

- Leverage PM-level meetings for policy continuity: Use the Prime Ministers’ council to convert summit-level political commitments into operational, budgeted programmes—connect declarations to implementation timetables.

- Be linguistically and symbolically literate: Recognise that procedural norms (such as Russian alphabetical ordering) matter for institutional culture; use diplomatic symbolism tactically, but also work to pluralise procedural practices through quiet diplomacy if India wishes to rebalance cultural signifiers within the SCO.

### Conclusion

SCO summit and council protocols are not merely administrative rules; they constitute the temporal and procedural architecture through which member states negotiate strategy, set agendas and coordinate policy. For India, understanding and engaging with these mechanics—rotation rules, preparatory ministerial timing, the extraordinary meeting trigger, and the linguistic embeddedness of procedure—is essential to converting multilateral participation into concrete national-security and strategic gains.

## Analytical observations

The summit record is more than a calendar: its patterning and choices of host reflect the SCO’s internal dynamics, regional focus and resilience to external shocks. Below are the principal patterns and their immediate significance for scholars of Indian strategic culture.

1. Annual cadence
- The SCO exhibits an almost uninterrupted annual summit rhythm since 2001. This regularity institutionalizes dialogue at two levels (heads of state and heads of government) and creates predictable opportunities for agenda-setting on security, political coordination and economic cooperation.

2. Geographic rotation and Central Asia emphasis
- Hosts rotate among member states, with particularly frequent use of Central Asian capitals (Astana, Bishkek, Tashkent, Dushanbe). This reflects the SCO’s origin and core operational geography—Central Asia remains the organization’s strategic heartland, where security and connectivity concerns are most acute.

3. Prominence of China and Russia
- Major Russian and Chinese cities (Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Shanghai, Beijing, Qingdao, Tianjin) appear recurrently as hosts. These high-profile venues underline the leadership role and diplomatic reach of the two largest members within SCO institutional practice.

4. Videoconference usage and organizational flexibility
- The remote summits of 2020–2023 correspond to global pandemic conditions and demonstrate institutional adaptability: the SCO was able to preserve continuity of leadership-level engagement through virtual means, an important precedent for remote diplomacy in crisis conditions.

5. Forward scheduling and rotation commitments
- Published future hosts (2024–2026) indicate ongoing relevance, internal commitments to rotation, and predictability in agenda planning. They also provide a short-term framework for anticipating thematic focuses tied to host-state priorities.

6. Dual forum functions
- Heads-of-state summits remain the primary decision-making forum (political/security declarations, membership change), while heads-of-government meetings focus more on economic and administrative cooperation. Maintaining both forums institutionalizes multi-track engagement across political and bureaucratic levels.

## Notable points and context

- Institutional genesis: The 14–15 June 2001 Shanghai summit is the SCO’s founding heads-of-state meeting and thus a key institutional benchmark. Its commemoration helps frame the SCO as a post–Cold War regional mechanism for security cooperation and political coordination among Eurasian states.
- Pandemic-era diplomacy: Videoconferencing in 2020–2023 signals both a technical adaptation and a diplomatic signal—members prioritized continuity of coordination even when in-person meetings were impractical, which has implications for crisis management and decision speed.
- Source gaps: The blank item in the heads-of-government listing suggests incomplete secondary-source capture. For rigorous scholarship, such lacunae should prompt verification with SCO primary records (official communiqués, secretariat releases).
- Nomenclature caveats: Host-city names reflect the period referenced (for example, “Astana” appears repeatedly although the city’s name has changed historically). Researchers should use contemporaneous naming when citing primary documents for precision.

## Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

- Forum for balancing and engagement: The SCO provides India with a multilateral platform where security (counterterrorism, non-traditional threats) and connectivity agendas intersect with great-power diplomacy. Regular summits allow New Delhi to project policy preferences, calibrate relations with China and Russia, and pursue regional initiatives without exclusive bilateral framing.
- Reading host patterns as influence signals: Frequency of hosting and choice of venue can be read as indicators of member-state activism. India should factor host-state priorities into summit expectations (e.g., a China-hosted summit may foreground connectivity proposals; a Central Asian host may emphasize security cooperation).
- Crisis resilience and operational continuity: The SCO’s shift to videoconferencing underscores that institutional commitments can be upheld even under restricted mobility; India’s strategic planning should assume such operational flexibility will be invoked in future crises.
- Agenda anticipation: Summit schedules are practical signals for likely agenda items—security declarations, counterterrorism cooperation, infrastructure/connectivity proposals and discussions on SCO enlargement. India may use summit cycles to time policy initiatives, bilateral outreach, or agenda-setting proposals.

## Recommendations for researchers and policy practitioners

- Track hosting frequency and venue selection to infer relative engagement and influence among members (frequent hosting = active diplomatic role).
- Treat videoconference occurrences as flags for external shocks (pandemics, conflicts) and as markers of institutional resilience.
- Verify ambiguous or blank entries (e.g., the unspecified heads-of-government item) against SCO primary sources for completeness and accuracy.
- Use announced future summit hosts and dates to anticipate and prepare policy positions—summit agendas often reflect host-state priorities.
- Distinguish between heads-of-state outcomes (political/security declarations) and heads-of-government items (economic/administrative cooperation) when analyzing SCO outputs and implications for India’s national security posture.

Concise records such as the one above are tools: they provide the chronological scaffolding necessary to interpret how institutional practice (where and how leaders meet) both reflects and shapes strategic behaviour. For India—an SCO member whose strategic culture balances regional outreach with great-power calibration—close reading of summit patterns offers practical insight into when and how to advance security and connectivity priorities within a multilateral Eurasian framework.

## Chapter X — The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the West: Contestation, Convergence, and Constraints

### Background: what the SCO is and why it matters for India
Established in 2001 by China, Russia and four Central Asian republics, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has evolved into a broad regional forum focused principally on security cooperation (notably counter‑terrorism), economic coordination and political consultation. Its membership has expanded: India and Pakistan became full members in 2017, and Iran attained full membership in 2023. For India—whose strategic culture prizes strategic autonomy, a balance between partnerships, and regional influence—the SCO presents both an opportunity (a regional platform for engagement with Russia, China and Central Asia) and a set of constraints imposed by the organisation’s internal heterogeneity.

### Early interactions with the United States (2001–2008)
The SCO’s early years were marked by a degree of explicit friction with the United States. In 2005 the United States applied for observer status and was rejected. At the July 2005 Astana summit the SCO collectively requested that the United States set a clear timetable for the withdrawal of its troops from SCO member states — a demand prompted by concerns that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq implied an open‑ended U.S. military presence in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. Shortly after that summit Uzbekistan asked the U.S. to vacate the K2 air base. Although a 2007 assessment concluded that the SCO did not launch direct public assaults on the U.S. presence, some summit language was interpreted in the West as a diplomatic reproach of Washington’s regional footprint.

Western reaction during this period was broadly skeptical: analysts and capitals doubted the SCO’s coherence and intentions, often viewing it as a vehicle for Sino‑Russian concerted pressure against Western influence in Central Asia.

### Evolution in Western perceptions: skepticism to pragmatic engagement (2010s)
By the 2010s Western perceptions had moderated. While suspicion of the SCO’s political aims persisted, many Western policymakers and analysts began to view the organisation pragmatically: not as an inevitable rival alliance but as a potentially constructive contributor to regional stability — notably in Afghanistan, where the SCO’s political–security mechanisms could complement international efforts at stabilization and counter‑terrorism. This evolution reflected an empirical reading of SCO practice: its emphasis on consensus, non‑binding commitments and institution‑building rather than on formal collective defense.

### Formal recognition and the limits of global acceptance: the U.N. vote (2023)
The SCO’s international institutional profile was underscored in September 2023 when the United Nations General Assembly approved resolution A/77/L.107 on cooperation between the U.N. and the SCO. The vote margin — 80 in favor, 2 against, 47 abstentions — is revealing. The only negative votes were cast by the United States and Israel, signalling continuing Western distrust of SCO motives or structures. The very large number of abstentions indicates ambivalence among U.N. member states: institutional recognition grew, but broad global endorsement remained uncertain.

### Why the SCO has not become a NATO‑style military alliance
Analyses that posture the SCO as an “anti‑NATO alliance” (a phrase used by the European Council on Foreign Relations in 2022) overstate both its internal cohesion and its institutional design. Several structural and political factors prevent the SCO from evolving into a NATO analogue:

- Institutional design: The SCO lacks an explicit mutual‑defense clause and relies on consensus decision‑making and non‑binding instruments. Its charters and practice prioritize consultation and cooperative activities (security, economic, cultural) over automatic military obligations.
- Divergent member priorities: Members pursue different strategic agendas. Central Asian states prioritize regime security and economic development; Russia and China oscillate between cooperation and competition; India has independent security concerns and global partnerships. These differences reduce incentives for deep military integration.
- Bilateral disputes and rivalries inside the membership: India–Pakistan hostility, periodic India–China tensions, and competing Sino‑Russian and Sino‑Central Asian interests create fault lines that prevent unified geopolitical action.
- Empirical behavior: Scholars such as Simon Curtis and Ian Klaus observe that surface similarities to collective security alliances are misleading — the SCO does not exhibit the reciprocal defense commitments, command structures or operational interoperability that define NATO.

These constraints explain why, despite rhetorical or media attempts to cast the SCO as a bloc opposing the West, it has functioned largely as a pragmatic forum for coordination rather than a cohesive anti‑Western military bloc.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
For India the SCO presents a distinct strategic calculus:

- Dual engagement: India (like several Central Asian states) has preserved friendly cooperation with both Western powers and Russia. Membership in the SCO does not preclude robust bilateral relations with the West; indeed, India’s diplomacy has sustained simultaneous cooperation with NATO members, Russia and China when interests permit.
- Buffer against bloc logic: India’s intense disputes with Pakistan and periodic tensions with China make it unlikely to support any SCO transformation into a China–Russia‑led military bloc. Strategic autonomy — a cornerstone of Indian strategic culture — militates against automatic alignment.
- Pragmatism in security policy: India can use the SCO to advance counter‑terrorism cooperation and regional stability objectives (especially vis‑à‑vis Afghanistan and Central Asia) while avoiding entanglement in collective defense commitments that would constrain its independent decision‑making.

### Conclusion: constrained institutional legitimacy and pragmatic engagement
The SCO’s trajectory illustrates a paradox: institutional enlargement and U.N. engagement have increased its legitimacy, but internal heterogeneity and the absence of binding mutual‑defense mechanisms limit its ability to become a coherent anti‑Western alliance. Western attitudes have shifted from early skepticism to guarded pragmatism, particularly where the SCO can aid regional stability. For India, the SCO is best read and used as a multilateral instrument that complements — rather than replaces — its strategic partnerships elsewhere, consistent with New Delhi’s longstanding preference for strategic autonomy in national security policy.

## Chapter: The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation — An Alternative Security Architecture and Its Limits for India

Introduction

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) occupies an unusual place in Eurasian security politics: it is simultaneously an instrument for major powers to shape regional order and a forum constrained by the very principles that justify its existence. Founded in 2001 out of the earlier Shanghai Five mechanism (1996), the SCO promotes sovereignty, territorial integrity, non-interference and mutual respect. Yet these principles have produced both cohesion and paralysis. This section examines the SCO’s declared objectives, key episodes and evolving agenda, and the specific dilemmas it poses for Indian strategic culture and national security policy.

1. Origins, stated principles and early messaging

- The SCO’s foundational language emphasizes equal rights, mutual respect, non-intervention, and the primacy of state sovereignty. These motifs were repeatedly restated in the 2005 Kazakhstan summit Declaration, which urged a “new security concept” built on trust, equality and cooperation despite ideological or social differences.
- Russian foreign policy elites framed the organisation as a vehicle for a more “rational and just” world order — a forum for an alternative geopolitical integration that would limit unilateral external interventions and balance Western influence.
- Western and academic commentators have been wary: some see the SCO as a vehicle to limit liberal-democratic diffusion within member states; others, notably Thomas Fingar, have argued that the Shanghai Five origins reflected efforts (especially by China) to constrain Russia’s unilateral reassertion in Central Asia while managing shared anxieties about instability.

2. The SCO as balance to external influence (and the narratives that accompany it)

- From official rhetoric to state media commentary, the SCO has often been presented as a regional bulwark against perceived Western (US/NATO) encroachment. Iranian and Chinese commentators — invoking broader Eurasian security narratives — have linked SCO activity to countering Western strategic presence in Central Asia and beyond.
- Analytical cautions: while counter-Western narratives persist, the SCO is not monolithic. Member states retain diverse priorities, and the organisation’s consensus-driven decision-making blunts any single actor’s capacity to deploy the SCO as a proxy for unilateral action.

3. Practice versus principle: notable episodes that exposed limits

- 2008 Russo–Georgian war: China’s refusal to endorse Russian actions — stressing sovereignty and territorial integrity — illustrated that SCO member-states will sometimes resist solidaristic cover for one another when core principles are at stake.
- Expansion and influence debates: concerns about SCO outreach (including speculative attention to Persian Gulf engagement) highlighted debates on whether the organisation could or should expand its strategic footprint beyond Central Asia.
- Academic critiques and tracks of influence (2007–2008): observers tracked the SCO’s possible expansion of influence into areas such as the Persian Gulf and argued that combating “extremism” could also be used as a cover for carving out zones of influence — a reading amplified by state and scholarly observers alike.

4. Internal fault-lines: competing agendas and the “Shanghai Contradiction Organisation”

- Multilateralism constrained: the SCO’s commitment to non-intervention and member sovereignty constrains its willingness and ability to mediate bilateral disputes. This institutional posture repeatedly surfaces whenever member conflicts have bilateral roots.
- India–Pakistan friction: repeated problems arise over terrorism language and incident attribution in joint communiqués. Indian objections to wording that echoes Pakistani narratives (for example, references to Balochistan) have on occasion prevented India from endorsing joint statements.
  - As chair in 2023 India invited Pakistan to a Goa meeting, but persistent bilateral animus (including disagreements over terrorism) and unresolved Central Asian border clashes among members showed the limits of SCO multilateral mediation.
  - Indian commentators and some analysts have dubbed the body the “Shanghai Contradiction Organisation,” capturing the tension between polyvalent membership and the expectation of cohesive multilateral action.
- Central Asian members: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and other Central Asian states prioritize immediate territorial security and are reluctant to cede mediation authority to the SCO when disputes are bilateral. Their behaviour reinforces the organisation’s low appetite for robust conflict resolution.

5. China–Russia dynamics and their implications for India

- Strategic alignment and hedging: the SCO provides a convenient multilateral platform that increasingly facilitates closer Russia–China cooperation, especially visible in the post-2014 and 2022 contexts. For India, this alignment raises questions about regional balance and the autonomy of Central Asian states.
- Limits to automatic support: even in cases of close Russia–China alignment, the consensus requirement of the SCO and the rhetorical centrality of sovereignty mean members can — and do — publicly diverge (as in 2008 over Georgia).

6. New and non-traditional security issues: terrorism, hydropolitics, and ecological concerns

- Terrorism: disagreement over the definition and attribution of terrorist acts is a recurrent fault-line. Joint texts that fail to explicitly name or condemn particular incidents frustrate members that seek a stronger collective stance against terrorism.
  - The June 2025 episode in Qingdao is illustrative: India refused to endorse a defense ministers’ joint statement because it omitted reference to the 22 April 2025 Pahalgam attack and included phrasing on Balochistan that India viewed as endorsing Pakistan’s narrative. Indian political and diplomatic leaders publicly called for accountability and clarity on cross-border terrorism.
- Water security and ecology: the SCO’s agenda has expanded beyond counterterrorism and military cooperation to encompass transboundary resource issues. India’s July 2025 interventions are emblematic:
  - External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar warned about the downstream impacts of China’s Medog Hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo (Brahmaputra), emphasizing risks to water security and ecological harm, and called for transparency and resumption of hydrological-data sharing.
  - Such hydropolitical concerns demonstrate how infrastructure on shared rivers can become diplomatic flashpoints within ostensibly security-focused institutions.

7. Implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy

- Institutional preference for sovereignty aligns with Indian strategic culture: India’s traditional emphasis on independence and non-interference makes the SCO’s stated principles congenial. However, India’s insistence on robust counterterrorism language and explicit naming of incidents reflects a different, more operationally focused security posture than simple adherence to non-intervention.
- Balancing acts: India faces a dual challenge — engaging the SCO to safeguard regional interests and counterterrorism cooperation while resisting language or initiatives that appear to legitimize narratives inimical to Indian interests (e.g., Balochistan references).
- Issue diversification requires policy adaptation: as the SCO’s remit expands into hydropolitics and ecological security, New Delhi must craft diplomatic and technical approaches (data-sharing mechanisms, regional water diplomacy) that advance Indian security without sacrificing broader multilateral engagement.

8. Points to watch (policy-relevant indicators)

- How the SCO codifies terrorism: evolving templates and language in joint statements will remain a recurrent source of India–Pakistan friction.
- China–Russia coordination: the depth and visibility of Sino-Russian alignment within SCO fora and exercises — and their impact on Central Asian policy choices and ties with Western states.
- Hydrological cooperation: progress (or lack thereof) on hydrological-data sharing, transparency commitments, and institutional mechanisms to mitigate cross-border ecological risks.
- Expansion and partnerships: any moves to broaden SCO membership or to institutionalize deeper ties with Persian Gulf actors would change the organisation’s strategic reach and implications.
- SCO responses to future intra-member conflicts: whether the SCO maintains strict neutrality or begins to display partisan inclinations will signal the organisation’s evolving character.

Conclusion

The SCO is best understood as an alternative, principle-driven security architecture that simultaneously enables and constrains member states’ ambitions. For India, the SCO offers both tactical opportunities for cooperation on transnational threats and structural challenges arising from divergent member agendas. The organisation’s insistence on sovereignty and non-interference preserves state autonomy but obstructs effective multilateral mediation of bilateral disputes. Recent episodes — from India’s chairmanship in 2023 to India’s refusals and public objections in 2025 over terrorism language and hydropower transparency — demonstrate the limits of SCO cohesion and the growing salience of non-traditional issues such as hydropolitics. If the SCO is to evolve into a more consequential regional actor, it must reconcile its founding principles with mechanisms capable of addressing the practical security externalities that now cross borders in Eurasia. For India’s strategic culture, the task is to leverage the SCO where interests align while protecting national priorities through selective engagement, clear red lines on terrorism attribution, and proactive diplomacy on shared-resource governance.

### The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation through a 2015 EPRS lens — implications for India

This section summarises and analyses a 2015 European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS) assessment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), integrates subsequent factual updates, and extracts the strategic implications for India’s security policy and regional posture. The EPRS appraisal is judicious and compact: it recognises the SCO’s demonstrable strengths as a multilateral security forum while flagging structural weaknesses that limit its capacity to evolve into a broader regional governance or development platform.

1. Context and membership (2015 baseline)
- The EPRS paper examines the SCO as it stood in 2015. At that time the core membership comprised China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.  
- (Significant post-2015 development: India and Pakistan became full members in 2017. This later enlargement alters the organisation’s composition and relevance for New Delhi, though it does not, by itself, resolve deeper institutional constraints identified in 2015.)

2. Principal achievement: a cooperative forum for managing differences
- The EPRS identifies the SCO’s primary accomplishment as providing a stable multilateral forum in which members can manage and, at times, balance conflicting national interests.  
- Functionally, the forum helps to de‑personalise and routinise inter-state engagement: regular summits, working groups and consultative mechanisms create repeated interactions that reduce the likelihood of episodic crises cascading into wider conflict.  
- For India this forum-quality is valuable. It provides New Delhi with an additional diplomatic channel into Central Asia and into dealings with China and Russia — a platform for issue‑based cooperation without immediate expectations of political alignment.

3. Security cooperation: the organisation’s strongest domain
- The EPRS emphasises the SCO’s concrete gains in security: coordination mechanisms, intelligence-sharing, information exchange, and large‑scale joint military exercises.  
- The organisation has developed agreed rhetorical and operational approaches towards the “three evils” (terrorism, separatism and extremism), embedding counter‑terrorism cooperation as a recurring, institutionalised activity.  
- These developments translate into tangible joint capabilities — combined drills, coordinated border security practices, and shared law‑enforcement initiatives — which, in practice, have been the SCO’s most binding and sustainable field of activity.

4. Major shortcomings and structural constraints
- Institutional weaknesses: The SCO’s governance is characteristically light. Decision‑making is largely consensus‑based, major organs lack robust independent powers, and there are limited enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance or follow‑through. Such institutional thinness slows action and reduces predictability.  
- Absence of common financial instruments: There is no pooled development fund or large, dedicated financial facility within the SCO to finance multi‑national infrastructure or economic projects. This absence constrains the organisation’s capacity to translate political decisions into on‑the‑ground economic outcomes.  
- Enduring conflicting national interests: Member states retain divergent and sometimes adversarial bilateral priorities. These tensions commonly map onto larger geopolitical rivalries — notably the China–Russia relationship that mixes cooperation and competition, and bilateral Central Asian disputes. These differing priorities frequently undermine prospects for deeper, cross‑cutting regional initiatives.

5. Consequence for the SCO’s remit: security-centric, not economic integrator
- Taken together, the EPRS concludes that structural weaknesses and financing gaps prevent the SCO from achieving deeper regional cooperation outside security. Economic and infrastructure integration under the SCO has therefore remained limited relative to its security work.  
- Without stronger institutionalisation or the creation of financial instruments, the SCO is unlikely to become a credible substitute for purpose‑built economic institutions or for bilateral, state‑led projects (for example, China’s Belt and Road mechanisms or Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union ambitions).

6. Typical reform prescriptions (echoing EPRS and wider literature)
- Deepen institutionalisation: develop clearer decision‑making procedures, stronger secretariat capacities and mechanisms for monitoring implementation.  
- Create joint financing mechanisms: establish pooled funds or partner with multilateral development banks to underwrite cross‑border infrastructure and regional economic projects.  
- Adopt project implementation and dispute‑management tools: create transparent project pipelines, accountability standards and mechanisms for resolving implementation disagreements.  
- These reforms are necessary if the SCO is to move beyond a primarily security-focused consultative forum to a more operational regional organisation.

7. Practical implications for India’s strategic culture and policy
- Why India engages: The SCO offers New Delhi a low‑risk multilateral venue consistent with India’s preference for selective multilateralism — an arena to pursue counterterrorism cooperation, gain diplomatic access to Central Asia, and manage relations with China and Russia simultaneously.  
- Benefits and limits: India gains security cooperation and diplomatic outreach through the SCO, but the organisation’s institutional and financial deficiencies constrain its utility as a vehicle for India’s broader economic and strategic objectives in Central Asia. For major connectivity or development projects New Delhi will continue to rely on bilateral arrangements, trilaterals, and alternative multilateral forums.  
- Strategic calculation: Given persistent bilateral tensions (for example India–Pakistan, India–China) and the SCO’s consensus culture, India must calibrate expectations — use the SCO for intelligence, security coordination and diplomatic signalling, but avoid over‑reliance on it for binding economic integration or dispute resolution.

8. Conclusion — a pragmatic assessment
- The EPRS’s balanced reading remains apt: the SCO is a useful diplomatic and security forum that helps members stabilise some regional dynamics and institutionalise counterterrorism cooperation.  
- However, the organisation’s institutional weaknesses, lack of pooled financing, and the persistence of conflicting national interests mean it is unlikely, without significant reform, to evolve into a comprehensive regional governance body capable of delivering large-scale economic integration.  
- For India, the SCO should be treated as a complementary instrument — valuable for security cooperation and regional diplomacy, but insufficient as the principal vehicle for India’s Central Asian economic or strategic ambitions unless the SCO itself undertakes deeper institutional and financial reform.

Reference note: This section synthesises findings from the 2015 European Parliamentary Research Service assessment of the SCO and situates those findings within the broader literature and subsequent membership developments (notably India’s accession in 2017).

# Gallery of Heads of State (Members) — Shanghai Cooperation Organisation

This short gallery-style section presents a snapshot of the heads of state associated with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as provided in the source outline and draws out the institutional, diplomatic and strategic implications that such a roster has for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. A gallery of leaders is not merely descriptive: it is a tool of protocol, symbolism and signalling. For a state like India — whose foreign policy balances non‑alignment traditions, regional security concerns, and deepening ties with extra‑regional powers — the composition and presentation of SCO leadership matter for both formal diplomacy and longer‑term strategic calculations.

Gallery (country — leader — official title)
- Republic of Belarus — Alexander Lukashenko — President of Belarus  
- People’s Republic of China — Xi Jinping — CCP General Secretary and President of China  
- Republic of India — Droupadi Murmu — President of India  
- Islamic Republic of Iran — Masoud Pezeshkian — President of Iran  
- Republic of Kazakhstan — Kassym‑Jomart Tokayev — President of Kazakhstan  
- Kyrgyz Republic — Sadyr Japarov — President of Kyrgyzstan  
- Islamic Republic of Pakistan — Asif Ali Zardari — President of Pakistan  
- Russian Federation — Vladimir Putin — President of Russia  
- Republic of Tajikistan — Emomali Rahmon — President of Tajikistan  
- Republic of Uzbekistan — Shavkat Mirziyoyev — President of Uzbekistan

Key observations and implications

- Descriptive function and use. At the most basic level, such a gallery is used in summit documentation, official communications, and public information portals. For researchers and policymakers it encapsulates who exercises formal authority in each SCO member state and is therefore important for mapping channels of communication and influence.

- Variation in titles and political systems. The gallery highlights divergent constitutional and party structures: China’s entry is styled as “CCP General Secretary and President,” reflecting the party‑state fusion that concentrates political power in the party office; other entries use republic/Islamic republic nomenclature reflecting official state styles. For India this matters because formal membership in the SCO is defined by heads of state, whereas substantive foreign policy is often led by the Prime Minister and executive ministries. The distinction between the formal representative (head of state) and the government head (prime minister or party chief) affects protocol, agenda control, and follow‑through on commitments made at summits.

- Protocol and representation. Titles determine rank and protocol at SCO Heads‑of‑State Council meetings. Where heads of state are ceremonial in practice (as with many parliamentary systems), a country may still send its prime minister or foreign minister depending on domestic arrangements and the political salience of a given summit. India’s strategic practice, therefore, must remain flexible: attending at the presidential level preserves formal equality in the Council, while prime‑ministerial participation can project political priority or provide substantive policy leadership.

- Membership composition and political signalling. The identities of leaders — and whether they are long‑entrenched incumbents or recent arrivals — signal continuity or change in member‑state behaviour. For example, the presence of Russia and China as heavyweight members anchors the SCO’s strategic orientation; the accession or elevation of states such as Iran (recently moved to full membership) alters institutional balance and agenda priorities (energy, security, counter‑terrorism, connectivity). India watches these shifts for their implications on regional power dynamics, defence cooperation, and economic linkages.

- Naming conventions and identity politics. The formal styles (“Islamic Republic,” “People’s Republic,” “Republic”) reflect domestic identity and constitutional framing that can influence foreign policy posture. India’s diplomatic engagement and public messaging frequently calibrate to such identity cues when building issue‑based coalitions or negotiating normative language in communiqués.

Practical considerations for India’s strategic culture and national security policy

- Verification and contemporaneity. Leadership rosters are time‑sensitive. India’s policy apparatus must verify the current occupant and functional authority of each post before engaging in wording of communiqués, bilateral meetings or security arrangements. Misidentifying a counterpart’s authority can create protocol faux pas or misreadings of commitment capacity.

- Distinguish form from function. India’s negotiators and strategists should systematically map the formal head‑of‑state role against de facto policy leadership (prime minister, party leader, security establishment) in each SCO member. This clarifies who can implement decisions, who controls foreign/security policy, and where bilateral leverage lies.

- Use of the gallery in signalling. Presentation of a leaders’ gallery in Indian briefings, public diplomacy products or summit materials is itself a tool: inclusion, ordering, and titulary choices can be used to underscore recognition, prioritise partnerships, or reflect neutrality. Indian protocol agencies and the Ministry of External Affairs must coordinate on such representational choices to ensure strategic coherence.

- Monitor membership evolution and agenda shifts. The SCO’s expansion, shifting membership statuses (member, observer, dialogue partner) and internal institutionalisation affect the organisation’s salience on defence, counter‑terrorism and connectivity issues — all central to India’s national security calculus. India should maintain continuous analysis of changes in leadership composition because they can presage policy shifts (e.g., deeper security cooperation with particular members).

Conclusion and recommended practice

A leaders’ gallery is more than a static list: it is a compact repository of institutional fact, diplomatic protocol and geopolitical signal. For Indian strategy‑makers, the gallery’s utility lies in (a) accurately identifying interlocutors, (b) understanding how formal titles map onto real policymaking authority, and (c) using representational choices consciously as part of wider diplomatic signalling. Always cross‑check the roster against up‑to‑date sources before preparing summit materials or bilateral outreach: leadership and membership statuses change, and those changes carry meaningful consequences for India’s engagement within the SCO.

### Gallery of Heads of Government (Members): presentation and implications

This short section presents and interprets a “Gallery of Heads of Government” — a schematic list that pairs member states associated with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) with the senior executive official who represents their government. The list as provided reads:

- Republic of Belarus — Aleksandr Turchin — listed as Prime Minister of Belarus.  
- People’s Republic of China — Li Qiang — listed as Premier (China’s head of government).  
- Republic of India — Narendra Modi — listed as Prime Minister of India (India’s head of government).  
- Islamic Republic of Iran — Mohammad Reza Aref — listed as First Vice President of Iran (not a prime minister).  
- Republic of Kazakhstan — Oljas Bektenov — listed as Prime Minister of Kazakhstan.  
- Kyrgyz Republic — Adylbek Kasymaliev — listed as Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of Kyrgyzstan (head-of-government title used in Kyrgyzstan).  
- Islamic Republic of Pakistan — Shehbaz Sharif — listed as Prime Minister of Pakistan.  
- Russian Federation — Mikhail Mishustin — listed as Prime Minister of Russia.  
- Republic of Tajikistan — Kokhir Rasulzoda — listed as Prime Minister of Tajikistan.  
- Republic of Uzbekistan — Abdulla Aripov — listed as Prime Minister of Uzbekistan (note: formatting on this line lacks a line break between name and title).

Below I expand on what such a gallery signals institutionally and politically, and why close attention to representation and data quality matters for India’s strategic calculations.

Institutional context: the SCO Council of Heads of Government
- The SCO operates, inter alia, through a Council of Heads of Government (prime ministers/premiers) that is specifically charged with economic, financial and technical cooperation. A gallery that pairs states with their heads of government therefore appears designed to document the membership of that council or the expected executive-level participants in economic working-level fora.
- Because the Council focuses on non-security cooperation (in SCO practice), the presence or absence of a true head-of-government in a delegation has procedural and substantive consequences for the scope of negotiation, mandate and decision making at meetings.

Variation in titles and what it tells us about representation
- The list illustrates a recurring feature of multilateral diplomacy: state delegations are presented under heterogeneous domestic titles — “Premier,” “Prime Minister,” “Chairman of the Cabinet,” and in one case “First Vice President.” These differences reflect constitutional and administrative diversity across SCO states.
- Practically, varying titles can matter for protocol and for legal clarity about who has authority to sign agreements, commit to budgets or make binding programmatic decisions at the Council level.
- The Kyrgyz entry correctly uses the local title “Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers,” underscoring the SCO’s need to accommodate different governmental lexica.

The Iran entry: an atypical representation that warrants verification
- Listing Iran’s “First Vice President” (Mohammad Reza Aref, as given) in a heads-of-government gallery is anomalous. Iran’s executive architecture does not include a prime minister; the President is conventionally the cabinet head and principal executive below the Supreme Leader, while the First Vice President is a deputy. If a gallery of heads of government aims for functional equivalence, Iran should be represented by its President (or by a specially mandated minister) rather than by a vice-presidential deputy.
- For analysts, such anomalies can signal either a shorthand error, a temporary delegation arrangement, or a political compromise in representation. Each possibility has distinct implications for the weight and longevity of commitments made in SCO economic fora.

Founding members, membership mix and geopolitical weight
- The list mixes the SCO’s founding Central Asian members (China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan) with other important regional actors and partners (India, Pakistan), plus Belarus and Iran. This composition captures the SCO’s dual character: a Central Asian security architecture that has broadened into a forum incorporating major Eurasian powers and selective partners.
- The co-presence of China, Russia, India and Pakistan signals significant geopolitical weight; for India’s strategic culture, participation at the heads-of-government level offers a venue to pursue economic cooperation while managing security competition with China and complex ties with Russia and Pakistan.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s representation in the SCO at heads-of-government meetings (or through a prime-ministerial delegation) is an instrument of its multilateral strategy: it advances economic and connectivity objectives while keeping open a platform for managing great-power interactions in Eurasia without exclusive alignment.
- The heterogeneous institutional makeup of the SCO — different titles, different constitutional forms — requires India to calibrate interlocutors carefully. Who speaks for whom matters when negotiating infrastructure linkages, energy deals, or joint economic projects that carry strategic externalities.
- India must also be attentive to protocol and representation: agreements signed by a deputy or atypical representative may have limited domestic legitimacy or require further ratification, influencing implementation timelines and India’s bargaining calculus.

Data hygiene, editorial recommendations and scholarly caveats
- Before publication, verify incumbency and titles. The entries above should be checked against authoritative government sources to confirm that each named individual held the stated office at the relevant date. Multilateral lists are liable to rapid obsolescence because of frequent cabinet changes across member states.
- Standardize nomenclature for readers: adopt a clear convention (e.g., “Country — domestic title (functional equivalence) — incumbent”) so that functional roles are transparent (for example: “Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers (head of government)” for Kyrgyzstan).
- Fix small formatting errors (the Uzbekistan line lacks a line break) and, more importantly, annotate any atypical representations (such as Iran’s First Vice President) with explanatory footnotes clarifying whether the person is a permanent head-of-government, an acting delegate, or a specially mandated representative.
- Where possible, supplement the gallery with a one-line note on the constitutional basis for who represents each state at heads-of-government fora. That makes the list not merely descriptive but analytically useful for readers assessing authority and commitment capacity.

Concluding note
- A seemingly simple “gallery” of heads of government is in fact a window onto institutional practice, state capacity and normative differences across the SCO. For India, careful reading of such galleries — and rigorous verification of who actually signs, speaks and commits — is a small but important element of a prudent national-security and strategic-economic posture in Eurasia.
