# BRICS — Introduction (breakdown and analysis)

This section provides a concise, analytic account of BRICS — its origins, institutional architecture, membership evolution, and the geopolitical and economic implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. The aim is scholarly clarity: to situate BRICS within broader patterns of global governance, to assess its capacities and limits, and to highlight practical monitoring priorities for analysts and policymakers in New Delhi.

## 1. Overview: what BRICS is and why it matters
- BRICS is an intergovernmental grouping originally formed as an informal diplomatic club of large emerging economies. Its public profile rests on two linked claims: (1) to advance South–South cooperation and development finance tailored to emerging markets, and (2) to provide an institutional counterweight to Western-dominated governance structures — whether in finance, payments, or diplomatic coordination.
- Current membership (as of early 2025): Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, and Indonesia (10 countries). The expansion since 2024–25 has produced the informal label “BRICS+” to describe outreach to other developing states and regional groupings.

## 2. Origins and early evolution
- Intellectual and diplomatic antecedents:
  - Russian foreign-ministry thinking (Yevgeny Primakov) and earlier trilateral/configurations such as RIC (Russia–India–China) and IBSA (India–Brazil–South Africa) provided regional precedents for non-Western cooperation.
  - The economic label “BRIC” was coined by British economist Jim O’Neill in 2001 and popularized by Goldman Sachs to denote rapidly growing emerging markets. This was an economic forecasting term, not initially a diplomatic project.
- Institutionalization:
  - 2009: First BRIC summit (Yekaterinburg) — Brazil, Russia, India, China formally adopting the BRIC acronym as a platform for regular summitry.
  - 2010: South Africa attended as a guest in April and joined formally in September; the grouping became BRICS and South Africa attended the 2011 summit as a full member.
- Expansion wave (2024–2025):
  - 2024 summit in Russia saw Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and UAE participate as members for the first time.
  - Early 2025: Indonesia became the first Southeast Asian member. The enlarged grouping and outreach have led to frequent use of the “BRICS+” concept.

## 3. Key dates (timeline)
- 2001: Jim O’Neill coins “BRIC.”
- 2009: First BRIC summit (Brazil, Russia, India, China).
- April 2010: South Africa attends as guest.
- September 2010: South Africa joins; grouping renamed BRICS.
- 2011: South Africa participates as full member at the summit.
- 2024: Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE attend their first BRICS summit as full members (Russia summit).
- Early 2025: Indonesia joins BRICS.

## 4. Institutional architecture and flagship initiatives
BRICS has moved beyond summit communiqués to create concrete multilateral instruments — the depth and effectiveness of which are central to debates about BRICS’ significance.

- New Development Bank (NDB)
  - Mandate: finance infrastructure and sustainable-development projects in member and other emerging economies.
  - Strategic role: positioned as an alternative/complement to the World Bank and regional development banks; emphasizes South–South lending.
  - Operational questions: capitalization, project pipelines, governance parity, and cofinancing arrangements determine its real-world impact.

- Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)
  - Mandate: pooled liquidity mechanism to assist members facing balance-of-payments pressures.
  - Strategic role: a financial safety net intended to reduce reliance on IMF conditionality.
  - Limitations: effective utility depends on reserve levels, activation rules, and members’ willingness to use it without political strings.

- BRICS PAY
  - Mandate: facilitate cross-border payments among members.
  - Strategic role: reduce dependence on Western-dominated payment systems and, indirectly, on dollar-clearing networks.
  - Status: pilot phases and interoperability experiments; scaling is technically and politically complex.

- BRICS basket reserve currency proposal
  - Mandate: create a diversified reserve instrument from member currencies to cushion reliance on the US dollar.
  - Status: conceptual and politically sensitive — significant hurdles in liquidity, convertibility, and trust.

- Knowledge and coordination architecture
  - Nearly 60 intra-group institutions, working groups, and think tanks across some 34 policy areas have been established in BRICS’ first 15 years, indicating deepening institutionalization even if functional outcomes vary.

## 5. Political economy: what BRICS can and cannot do
- Potential strengths
  - Institutional alternatives: NDB, CRA and payment initiatives can provide tangible benefits for members and partners, especially in infrastructure finance and emergency liquidity.
  - Diplomatic leverage: enlarged membership and outreach (BRICS+) enhance geopolitical weight and create negotiating platforms in multilateral fora.
  - Normative influence: pushes for reforms in global governance (IMF/World Bank representation, financing principles) and elevates South–South perspectives.

- Structural limits
  - Scale and liquidity: BRICS finance and payment systems remain small relative to the IMF/World Bank and global dollar liquidity; displacement of dollar-dominated systems would be gradual and contingent.
  - Heterogeneity: members differ sharply in economic size, political systems, strategic interests, and relations with the West — complicating unified policy responses.
  - Consensus decision-making: expansion amplifies coordination costs and risks diluted policy coherence.
  - Implementation gaps: institutions require reliable funding, project pipelines, and governance mechanisms to move from declaration to delivery.

## 6. Geopolitical readings and contestations
- Competing narratives
  - Alternative to the West: some Western analysts frame BRICS as an emerging rival bloc to the G7 and Western-led institutions.
  - Anti-West/anti-American coalition: other commentators argue BRICS is shaped by anti-Western tendencies, particularly where members seek to blunt Western sanctions or influence.
  - Pragmatic partnership: a third view emphasizes BRICS as a loose, interest-driven coalition focused on specific economic and diplomatic objectives rather than a coherent geopolitical alliance.

- Real-world behavior
  - BRICS initiatives have created parallel channels that can press for reform in IMF/World Bank governance and offer practical cooperation in finance and development.
  - But divergent foreign-policy orientations (e.g., India–China border tensions, differing responses to Russia’s actions in Ukraine, varied relations with the U.S.) constrain any automatic geopolitical alignment.

## 7. Membership, regional balance, and representation
- Geographic diversification
  - Africa: South Africa (2010), later Egypt and Ethiopia (2024) boost African engagement.
  - Middle East and Persian Gulf: Iran and the UAE add Middle Eastern dimensions.
  - Southeast Asia: Indonesia (2025) brings major Southeast Asian representation.
- Political implications
  - Expansion improves global reach but raises coherence problems: ideological heterogeneity and competing regional priorities become more salient.
  - BRICS+ provides a flexible outreach model that allows engagement without extending full membership’s obligations.

## 8. BRICS and India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s stake
  - Founding member and longtime advocate of multipolarity and South–South cooperation; BRICS complements India’s diplomatic toolkit alongside G20, QUAD, IBSA and bilateral ties.
  - Economic interests: access to development finance (NDB), alternatives to dollar-clearing friction, and expanded trade/FDI options are material benefits.
  - Strategic balancing: BRICS enables India to pursue a pragmatic agenda with China and Russia while retaining strategic autonomy and ties to Western partners.
- Constraints and tensions
  - India must manage border and strategic frictions with China within a forum that seeks consensus, making frank security topics sensitive.
  - Divergent approaches to sanctions, human-rights issues, and great-power competitions limit the grouping’s utility in crises.
  - India’s domestic political economy — and its global ambitions — require careful calibration between institutional engagement in BRICS and commitments in other multilateral settings (G20, UNSC allies, QUAD).

## 9. Implications and risks (summary)
- Institutional rival bloc potential: BRICS may institutionalize alternatives to Western-led structures, but scope depends on resource commitments and operational capacity.
- Financial diversification: gradual potential to reduce dollar dominance through payment systems, a basket reserve, and NDB financing — yet technical, liquidity, and political barriers are high.
- Dilution of coherence: rapid enlargement risks policy incoherence, slower decision-making, and weakened internal governance.
- Pressure for reform: BRICS initiatives can exert diplomatic pressure for IMF/World Bank reforms, particularly on representation and development financing priorities.
- Reputational dynamics: Western characterizations of BRICS as an anti-Western bloc can harden external responses, complicating India’s balancing act.

## 10. Monitoring priorities and recommended next steps for Indian analysts
For policymakers and analysts focused on India’s strategic culture and security policy, the following are priority indicators to track:
- Summit communiqués and joint statements: look for concrete commitments on new institutions, membership criteria, payment arrangements, and joint positions in multilateral fora.
- Financial metrics: monitor NDB capital increases, lending volumes and project portfolios; CRA reserve levels and any activations; BRICS PAY pilots and transaction volumes.
- Payment and currency developments: progress on interoperability, settlement currencies used in intra-BRICS trade, and any moves toward a currency basket as a reserve instrument.
- Membership dynamics: applications, invitations, and outreach (BRICS+) to assess geographic balance and strategic intent.
- Voting and coordination in global institutions: patterns of coordination at the UN General Assembly, votes on IMF reform, and joint positions at the World Bank.
- Bilateral fault lines: India–China and India–Russia relations (including defence ties and border tensions) as stress tests of intra-BRICS cohesion.

## 11. Conclusion
BRICS is neither a monolithic “alternative G7” nor merely a rhetorical club. It is an evolving institutional constellation combining development finance, payment experimentation, and diplomatic outreach. For India, BRICS offers opportunities—development finance, diplomatic platforms, and enhanced South–South ties—while presenting classic strategic dilemmas: how to engage pragmatically with China and Russia within multilateral frameworks without compromising strategic autonomy or core national-security priorities. The future influence of BRICS will depend less on summitry and rhetoric than on the delivery capacity of its institutions (NDB, CRA, payment arrangements), the coherence of an increasingly diverse membership, and the willingness of members to invest resources and political capital in operational cooperation. Analysts should therefore focus on tangible outputs and hard metrics, not only pronouncements, to assess BRICS’ trajectory and its implications for India’s strategic posture.

## Origins and Early Institutionalization of BRIC(S): Context and Consequences for India’s Strategic Culture

This section traces the intellectual and diplomatic trajectory that produced BRIC(S), emphasizing how economic narratives and geopolitical strategy intersected to create a multilateral formation with direct bearing on India’s strategic culture and national-security considerations.

1. Emergence of the idea: geopolitical and economic antecedents
- Collective political action among states in the late 1990s preceded and in important ways set the stage for the later economic narrative of “BRIC.” The concept of a post‑unipolar or multipolar world — aimed at reducing the dominance of a single Western (and particularly U.S.) architecture of global governance — was articulated by practitioners as well as analysts.
- A prominent early voice was Yevgeny Primakov, then Russian foreign minister and later prime minister, who articulated a “multipolar‑group” idea and reiterated it at a speech in New Delhi in 1998. Primakov’s framing cast potential groupings of major non‑Western powers as a geopolitical counterweight designed to diversify authority in global institutions and contest unilateral policy dominance.

2. Analytical coinage versus diplomatic genesis
- The label “BRIC” was not born in a diplomatic chancery but in investment analysis. Jim O’Neill of Goldman Sachs coined the acronym in 2001 to identify four fast‑growing emerging markets with strong macroeconomic growth prospects. This origin explains an essential tension in the grouping: the term captured economic potential before a shared diplomatic project existed.
- An alternative ordering (sometimes cited informally as “CRIB”) surfaced at the time, but “BRIC” proved the more memorable and sticky label. Over time the investment construct acquired a political and diplomatic life it did not initially intend.

3. Building blocks: RIC and IBSA as pre‑existing networks
- Prior to BRIC summits, smaller trilateral and regional formats — notably RIC (Russia‑India‑China) and IBSA (India‑Brazil‑South Africa) — provided practical templates and precedents. These formations demonstrate how informal, often regionally anchored networks can serve as building blocks for larger multilateral assemblies. For India, participation in RIC and IBSA reflected both regional affinities and an appetite for coalitions that enhance strategic autonomy.

4. From informal contacts to formal summitry
- The diplomatic evolution followed a familiar pattern in international organization formation: informal contacts, regularized ministerial meetings, and then leaders’ summits. Foreign ministers of the initial four countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) first met informally in New York in September 2006 on the margins of the UN General Assembly — a pattern of high‑level contact that built familiarity and cooperative habits.
- The process culminated in a full‑scale diplomatic meeting and the first formal summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia, on 16 June 2009. Heads of state — Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Brazil), Dmitry Medvedev (Russia), Manmohan Singh (India), and Hu Jintao (China) — attended. The summit took place at the height of the global financial crisis and reflected both immediate economic concerns and longer‑term institutional ambitions.

5. Agenda in 2009: economic crisis, institutional reform, and symbolic currency talk
- The Yekaterinburg summit’s central concerns were the global economic situation and reform of international financial institutions (IFIs). The BRIC leaders argued developing countries needed greater representation and influence in the governance of institutions like the IMF and World Bank.
- The communique went further in rhetorical ambition: it called for a new global reserve currency that would be “diverse, stable and predictable.” While rhetorically signaling intent to reduce reliance on a single dominant currency, the statement stopped short of proposing an actionable substitute to the U.S. dollar. Notably, the declaration coincided with a fall in the dollar’s value against other major currencies, though the statement was more a political signal than the proximate cause of the dollar’s movements.
- Operationalizing a true alternative reserve currency would require trust among central banks, deep and liquid capital markets, cross‑border payment arrangements, and institutional mechanisms — requirements that the 2009 statement did not and realistically could not immediately satisfy.

6. Institutional follow‑through: the New Development Bank
- One concrete institutional outcome associated with BRICS was the establishment of the New Development Bank (NDB), headquartered in Shanghai and operational from 2014. The NDB was pitched as the premier financial institution of BRICS: a mechanism to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member countries and to offer an alternative source of development finance to the World Bank and IMF.
- For India, the NDB represented both a source of project finance and a policy instrument aligned with its interest in plurilateral institutional alternatives that might offer greater flexibility and fewer conditionalities than traditional Bretton Woods lenders.

7. Limits, critiques, and enduring tensions
- The movement from a market label to a diplomatic formation revealed persistent limits. Jim O’Neill himself later assessed (statements in 2021 and 2024) that BRICS had largely failed to cohere into a meaningful unified global force. His critique underscores a structural tension: the analytic category captured economic trajectories, but divergent strategic interests, geopolitical rivalries, and asymmetries in power and institutions constrained political integration.
- Key practical challenges remain: heterogeneity in economic sizes and development levels among members; differing foreign‑policy priorities (regional security concerns, bilateral rivalries, alignment choices); and the modest institutional capacity of BRICS to coordinate complex policies at speed and depth.

8. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national‑security policy
- Multipolarity and strategic autonomy: India’s participation in BRIC(S) must be read against a long‑standing strategic preference for multipolarity and non‑alignment‑in‑spirit. Engagement in these forums is consistent with India’s desire to diversify relationships, resist single‑power dependence, and seek institutional mechanisms that can buttress its autonomy in foreign policy.
- Balancing economic and security imperatives: The BRICS project appealed to India for economic reasons (access to development finance, markets, and a voice in IFI reform) and for geopolitical reasons (a platform to contest unilateral norms). Yet divergent strategic interests — especially vis‑à‑vis China and Russia — mean India treats such groupings instrumentally rather than as a vehicle for deep political convergence.
- Institutional hedging: Pre‑existing networks (RIC, IBSA) and participation in the NDB illustrate how India has used multilateral formats selectively to pursue development and security goals while retaining flexibility on issues where alignment could compromise national interests.
- Economic security as national security: The 2009 emphasis on reserve‑currency diversification and the NDB’s creation reflect an expanding conception of national security in which financial architecture, access to stable funding, and resilience to external shocks are integral to strategic planning.

Conclusion
BRIC(S) emerged at the intersection of an investment narrative about economic rise and a geopolitical push for multipolarity. For India, BRICS is consequential not because it constitutes a unified bloc, but because it offers tools — institutional, economic, and diplomatic — to advance a strategic culture that prizes autonomy, seeks reform of global governance, and balances economic development with security imperatives. The movement from acronym to summit to bank exemplifies both the possibilities and limits of plurilateral cooperation among unequal and often divergent rising powers.

### South Africa’s Accession to BRIC (BRICS), 2010–2011

Summary
- In 2010 South Africa initiated and completed a rapid accession to the BRIC grouping — the original quartet of Brazil, Russia, India and China — prompting the grouping to be renamed BRICS. South Africa’s first full participation as a member occurred at the third BRICS summit (Sanya, China) in 2011, when President Jacob Zuma attended as a full member.

The accession process
- Initiation and timeline: South Africa formally entered the admission process in August 2010 and saw its membership confirmed on 24 December 2010. The roughly four‑month interval between formal application and membership is notable for its speed compared with many multilateral admission procedures.
- Invitation and consensus: China issued a formal invitation, which was then accepted by the other BRIC members. The sequence underscores a consensus‑based, informal enlargement mechanism driven by member states’ diplomatic initiative rather than by codified institutional rules.
- Renaming and first summit participation: With South Africa’s inclusion the acronym became “BRICS,” signaling the group’s broadened geographic reach. At the 2011 Sanya summit in China, Jacob Zuma participated as a full member, marking South Africa’s operational integration into the group’s summit diplomacy.

Symbolic and practical significance
- Renaming as signal: Changing BRIC to BRICS served both a symbolic and practical purpose. Symbolically it acknowledged Africa’s formal presence in the grouping; practically it helped project BRICS as a more geographically and politically plural coalition of major emerging economies.
- African foothold: South Africa conferred upon BRICS an official foothold in Africa, providing the group with a direct interlocutor on African economic and political issues and strengthening BRICS’ claim to represent a genuinely intercontinental coalition of emerging powers.

Institutional and diplomatic implications
- Informal enlargement practice: The accession illustrates how BRICS has expanded through member consensus and bilateral diplomacy rather than through a written enlargement protocol. This flexibility enables relatively swift adjustments in membership but also means enlargement decisions reflect the prevailing balance of power and political will among members.
- China’s diplomatic role: Beijing’s role in extending the invitation highlights China’s active diplomacy within BRICS enlargement processes and its capacity to shape the group’s trajectory. At the same time, the collective acceptance by other members shows a degree of intra‑group coordination rather than unilateral decision‑making.

Economic and geopolitical consequences
- Diversified economic profile: Although South Africa’s GDP and population are smaller than several BRICS partners, its inclusion diversified the group’s economic and political profile by adding a southern‑hemisphere African economy and a regional leadership role in southern Africa.
- Gateway to Africa: South Africa functions as a strategic gateway for BRICS engagement with the African continent — in markets, investment linkages, and multilateral coordination with regional bodies. This enhanced BRICS’ potential leverage in debates over global economic governance.
- Perception and legitimacy: The move from a four‑country club to a five‑member grouping strengthened BRICS’ narrative as a coalition of major emerging economies that can speak to concerns of the Global South, thereby enhancing its external legitimacy.

Operational integration
- Summit diplomacy and institutional deepening: South Africa’s attendance at the 2011 Sanya summit signalled immediate operational integration into BRICS’ summit cycle and working‑level cooperation. The accession reinforced the practice of annual summits and contributed to the later development of institutional mechanisms (finance and development cooperation initiatives pursued in subsequent years).

Broader trend: South–South cooperation and alternatives to Western‑led institutions
- BRICS enlargement sits within a larger pattern of South–South institutionalism aimed at creating complements or alternatives to Western‑dominated multilateral institutions. South Africa’s entry both symbolized and operationalized that trend, offering BRICS a clearer claim to represent a multi‑continental constituency advocating reform of global governance structures.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Multilateral leverage: For India — an original BRIC member — South Africa’s accession carried both opportunity and challenge. It strengthened BRICS’ claim to global representativeness, providing India a broader platform for advocating reform of international economic and political institutions (e.g., IMF, World Bank, UN reform).
- African engagement and partnerships: India’s own strategic and economic interests in Africa meant that South Africa’s membership was of immediate relevance. New BRICS channels offered additional avenues to coordinate development, trade and diplomatic initiatives with African partners through a forum that included a leading African state.
- Managing intra‑group dynamics: The accession accentuated the need for India to manage intra‑BRICS dynamics, particularly vis‑à‑vis China. India’s strategic culture — which emphasizes autonomy, multialignment, and balancing great‑power influence — required it to use BRICS both to cooperate on shared economic and normative goals and to guard against any imbalance that might privilege another member’s interests.
- Security‑adjacent considerations: While BRICS is not primarily a security alliance, its economic initiatives (investment, resource linkages, development finance) have security implications for India’s national interests (energy security, access to strategic minerals, maritime interests via African partners). India thus had an incentive to shape BRICS’ economic agenda to align with its broader national security priorities.
- Institutional opportunity: The accession demonstrated the group’s capacity for institutional enlargement and experimentation — an environment in which India could press for multilateral instruments (later exemplified by the New Development Bank) that serve emerging‑market development needs and, indirectly, support India’s strategic objectives.

Key dates (chronology)
- August 2010: Formal admission process for South Africa begins.
- 24 December 2010: South Africa officially becomes a BRICS member after invitation and acceptance by existing members.
- April/2011 (Sanya summit): Jacob Zuma participates as a full member at the third BRICS summit.

Concluding observation
- South Africa’s rapid accession to BRICS in 2010–2011 materially broadened the grouping’s geographic and political scope, reinforced its South–South credentials, and introduced new diplomatic and strategic calculations for India. For Indian policymakers, the enlargement presented both expanded multilateral opportunity and the requirement to navigate an evolving coalition in which economic cooperation, normative claims to reform, and great‑power dynamics intersect with India’s national security concerns.

## BRICS and the New Development Bank: Strategic Calculus for India’s Security and Strategic Culture

The creation of the New Development Bank (NDB) and an associated reserve pool by the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) represents a salient episode in the evolution of global economic governance — one with direct implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy. Between 2012 and 2015 BRICS moved from declaratory politics to institution-building, motivated by a desire to increase policy autonomy, secure alternative development finance, and gain bargaining leverage vis‑à‑vis the Bretton Woods institutions. For India, the initiative combined development imperatives (infrastructure finance, access to liquidity) with strategic goals (greater voice in global governance, hedging against overdependence on Western‑dominated institutions).

Key developments and timeline
- June 2012: BRICS pledge US$75 billion to boost IMF lending capacity — a conditional offer explicitly designed to press for IMF voting‑share reforms rather than a simple transfer of funds.
- March 2013 (Durban): Leaders agreed to create a new global financial institution (the projected New Development Bank) with an initial target to operationalize it by 2014.
- September 2013 (St. Petersburg): Member commitments to a currency‑stability pool were announced: China US$41 billion; Brazil, India, Russia US$18 billion each; South Africa US$5 billion — revealing China’s dominant financial contribution.
- October 2013: Russia announced plans (via Finance Minister Anton Siluanov) for a US$100 billion mechanism to stabilize currency markets in early 2014.
- April 2014: Implementation slippage — the bank and reserve pool had not been created; the timetable moved into 2015.
- July 2014 (Fortaleza): BRICS signed founding documents creating the New Development Bank (authorized capital US$100 billion) and a Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) exceeding US$100 billion in aggregate pledges; subsequent operationalization continued into 2015 and the NDB established its headquarters in Shanghai.

Purposes and institutional design
- Primary purposes:
  - Provide development financing (especially infrastructure and sustainable development) for BRICS members and other emerging economies.
  - Establish a reserve liquidity backstop to stabilize member currencies and provide short‑term balance‑of‑payments support (the CRA).
  - Deepen economic cooperation across export credit, innovation, and related domains — i.e., create practical modalities of economic statecraft within BRICS.
- Positioning vis‑à‑vis Bretton Woods institutions:
  - The NDB was framed both as a complement and as an alternative: it sought to fill gaps (large infrastructure financing, faster procedures, different conditionality) while signalling dissatisfaction with perceived imbalances in IMF/World Bank governance.

Financial architecture and governance tensions
- Financial figures (founding pledges and authorizations):
  - June 2012 pledge: US$75 billion (conditional to IMF reform).
  - September 2013 pledges for the reserve pool: China US$41 billion; Brazil/India/Russia US$18 billion each; South Africa US$5 billion.
  - Fortaleza (July 2014): NDB authorized capital US$100 billion; CRA/ reserve pool aggregated to over US$100 billion.
- Governance fault lines:
  - China’s dominant contribution (and the size of its foreign‑exchange reserves) translated into a push for commensurate managerial influence and a preference for hosting the reserve. This raised classical multilateral dilemmas: unequal contributions, demand for proportional influence, and concerns about capture versus equitable governance.
  - India’s stance reflected a dual objective: secure access to finance and influence NDB governance so that decisionmaking would be inclusive and not subordinated to any single state’s strategic aims.
  - Negotiations therefore centred on voting power, leadership rotation, capitalization schedules, and the geographic location of institutions — all of which delayed immediate implementation.

Implementation challenges and operational concerns
- Practical hurdles in turning an agreement into an operational multilateral bank included:
  - Capitalization mechanics and timing of paid‑in capital.
  - Securing credit ratings and establishing credible lending capacity.
  - Staffing the institution with technical, legal, and operational personnel and defining robust safeguards (environmental and social).
  - Designing lending criteria, project selection pipelines, and co‑financing arrangements with existing MDBs.
- These administrative and political matters explain the slippage between the 2013–2014 timetable and eventual operationalization in 2015.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic autonomy and diversification:
  - Participation in the NDB/CRA advanced India’s aim to diversify sources of development finance, reducing reliance on IMF/World Bank conditionalities and thereby increasing policy space in macroeconomic management and infrastructure investment.
- Influence in global governance:
  - Institutional membership bolstered India’s claim to a larger role in global financial governance — reinforcing a long‑standing element of India’s strategic culture that seeks status through multilateral leadership and institutional voice.
- Balancing great‑power dynamics:
  - The NDB presented India with an instrument for pragmatic cooperation with China and other emerging powers while also serving as a hedge against exclusive dependence on either Western institutions or a single partner. India’s approach highlighted calibrated engagement: extract development benefits without subsuming strategic autonomy.
- Operational and reputational payoffs:
  - Access to faster, potentially less conditional infrastructure finance supported India’s developmental and security agenda (connectivity, logistics, civil‑military dual‑use infrastructure). Yet India also had to ensure that governance norms, safeguard standards, and transparency were not compromised — both for domestic political legitimacy and international normative positioning.

Complementarity, competition, and geopolitical signaling
- The NDB signalled BRICS’ intent to reshape aspects of the international financial architecture, communicating a move toward multipolar governance. For India, signaling mattered as much as material outcomes: active participation conveyed its stake in a revised order and its willingness to undertake institutional reform from within emerging‑power coalitions.
- Nevertheless, the NDB’s posture remained ambivalent: it sought cooperation with Bretton Woods institutions on co‑financing and standards even as it provided an institutional counterweight to Western dominance.

Concluding reflections
The creation of the NDB and the CRA illustrates how emerging powers translate strategic preferences into institutional instruments. For India, the episode combined development needs with strategic signaling: obtaining alternative financing, enhancing its voice in global institutions, and managing great‑power dynamics within a coalition where China’s financial heft required sensitive governance bargains. The delays and negotiation frictions reveal the structural complexities of building new multilateral institutions — especially when financial asymmetries intersect with competing visions of management and control. Understanding these dynamics is essential for situating India’s broader strategic culture, which prizes institutional engagement, status acquisition, and calibrated autonomy in its national security calculus.

## BRICS — Other initiatives (Section breakdown and analysis)

This section examines a cluster of BRICS initiatives beyond headline diplomacy — technical cooperation, institutionalization, infrastructure proposals and sectoral networks — and evaluates their practical achievements, setbacks and geopolitical implications. Taken together these initiatives illuminate two enduring tendencies of BRICS: a drive for strategic autonomy in infrastructure, data and finance; and the practical limits imposed by heterogeneous national priorities, financing constraints and legal/geopolitical friction. For readers interested in India’s strategic culture and national security policy, these initiatives show how New Delhi uses BRICS both instrumentally (to diversify partnerships and finance options) and normatively (to advance a multilateral agenda consonant with Indian preferences for sovereignty and rule-bound engagement).

1. Joint statistical publication (since 2011)
- What it is: Annual joint statistical reports prepared by the national statistical offices of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
- Purpose: Compare methodologies, place national statistical production in a multinational perspective, and provide a single data platform for member benefit.
- Significance: Enhances comparability of key indicators across large emerging economies, supports collective policymaking, and bolsters BRICS’ claim to produce credible alternatives or complements to Western-led statistical fora.
- Analytical note for India: Participation strengthens India’s ability to shape narratives about development performance and to access harmonized indicators useful for multilateral planning and NDB project assessment.

2. BRICS Cable — a high-ambition infrastructure proposal (2012–2015)
- Proposal: An optical‑fibre submarine communications cable linking BRICS capitals/regions.
- Motivation: Concerns about U.S. surveillance (post‑Snowden disclosures) and a desire for more autonomous communications infrastructure.
- Outcome: Construction abandoned circa 2015, almost certainly because of prohibitive upfront costs, complex multilateral legal/regulatory issues, and coordination challenges among diverse telecom operators.
- Lessons: Submarine cable projects demand enormous capital, long lead times and sophisticated contracting; alternatives (private‑sector consortia, regional cable partners or investment via multilateral banks) are often more feasible.
- Strategic implication for India: The idea resonated with India’s digital-security instincts, but the failure shows limits of state-led intergovernmental infrastructural initiatives without viable financing and operator alignment.

3. ICT cooperation and the letter of intent (2019)
- Development: Communications ministers signed a letter of intent on ICT cooperation at the Brasília meeting.
- Meaning: A political commitment to pursue technical standards, cybersecurity cooperation and industrial collaboration; however, letters of intent require follow‑through into concrete technical agreements to matter.
- For analysts: Monitor technical workstreams — standards harmonization, cross‑certification schemes, procurement coordination — to judge whether this becomes operational cooperation or remains declaratory.

4. New Development Bank (NDB) financial support
- Commitment: A plan to mobilize or make available roughly US$15 billion to assist member states facing economic strain, notably in post‑COVID recovery.
- Context: This counter‑cyclical lending is institutionally significant but modest relative to members’ macroeconomic needs. NDB effectiveness depends on capitalization, credit rating, governance and the willingness of members to expand resources.
- Relevance to India: The NDB represents a tangible instrument for New Delhi to access development finance outside Bretton Woods structures and to support projects aligned with India’s infrastructural priorities.

5. COVID‑19 era diplomacy: summits and diverging positions
- 2020 (St. Petersburg, virtual): Leaders addressed pandemic responses and called for reforms in the multilateral system.
- 2021 summit: Divergence surfaced publicly — Prime Minister Modi called for a WHO‑led, transparent investigation into COVID origins; President Xi Jinping urged against politicisation of such probes.
- Implication: These differences illustrate how fault lines (public‑health transparency vs. resistance to politicisation) complicate unified BRICS statements on sensitive global health questions and reflect deeper variation in risk perceptions and normative commitments.

6. Legal and diplomatic friction: ICC arrest warrant and Johannesburg summit (2023)
- Incident: In May 2023 South Africa offered diplomatic immunity to Russian officials, including President Vladimir Putin, to facilitate participation at the 15th BRICS Summit despite an ICC arrest warrant.
- Outcome: Putin did not attend in person (July–August 2023) but participated remotely and delivered virtual remarks.
- Significance: The episode foregrounds tensions between host‑state obligations under the Rome Statute and geopolitical solidarity. For BRICS cohesion it demonstrates how legal instruments (like ICC warrants) can intersect awkwardly with summit diplomacy, forcing member states into trade‑offs between rule‑of‑law commitments and strategic alignments.

7. Institutional proliferation and operational outputs
- Quantity and breadth: In its first 15 years BRICS produced hundreds of decisions and established nearly 60 intra‑group institutions, spanning more than 30 subject areas.
- Key bodies and networks: BRICS Business Council; BRICS Think Tanks Council; BRICS Women’s Business Alliance; BRICS Business Forum; BRICS Academic Forum; plus a wider network of national think‑tanks and dialogues.
- New Kazan initiatives: Announcements included a BRICS Deep‑Sea Resources International Research Center and a BRICS Digital Ecosystem Cooperation Network.
- Interpretation: The breadth and density of institutions signal a transition from ad‑hoc summitry to structured cooperation. Institutionalization increases capacity for project identification and continuity but creates coordination and funding demands.

8. Space cooperation: satellite data sharing and Russian proposals
- 2021 agreement: BRICS leaders agreed to develop a satellite constellation concept and to share remote‑sensing data using six existing satellites from China, Russia and India — an immediate, value‑adding form of cooperation for agriculture, disaster management and environmental monitoring.
- 2023 Russian proposal: A suggested BRICS joint research station on Russia’s orbital platform.
- Practicalities and risks: Data‑sharing produces near‑term benefits but a dedicated BRICS constellation or joint orbital facilities would demand long‑term industrial collaboration, substantial funding, technology export‑control navigation and interoperability arrangements.
- Strategic value for India: Shared remote sensing supports national priorities (agriculture, disaster response, cartography), but deeper aerospace collaboration would require careful management of security, export controls and bilateral technology norms.

9. Tone, themes and underlying tensions
- Mixed record: The BRICS agenda combines concrete institutional achievements (statistical publications, NDB activity, data‑sharing) with visible setbacks (abandoned BRICS Cable, politicisation disputes, legal complications).
- Core themes:
  - Strategic autonomy: Aspirations to build parallel capabilities in finance, data, telecoms and space.
  - Institutionalization: Proliferation of bodies suggests intent to routinize cooperation.
  - Heterogeneity: Political systems, economic models and foreign‑policy priorities produce limits to unified action.
- Operational risks: Cost overruns, divergent priorities, sanctions and export‑control restrictions, and governance disputes within BRICS institutions are persistent vulnerabilities.

10. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Instrumental diversification: BRICS offers India alternative financial instruments (NDB), technical cooperation and multilateral platforms that reduce dependence on any single power bloc.
- Sovereignty and norms: India’s calls for WHO‑led inquiry and measured public positions reflect a preference for rule‑based multilateralism combined with strategic autonomy — a hallmark of Indian strategic culture.
- Security‑technology trade‑offs: India must weigh cooperation benefits (satellite data, ICT collaboration) against technology‑control, cybersecurity and supply‑chain risks.
- Diplomatic posture: Episodes such as South Africa’s immunity offer and Putin’s remote participation illustrate New Delhi’s navigation of legal norms and geopolitical solidarity; India’s choices will be informed by both normative commitments and strategic calculations.

11. Metrics and follow‑ups for analysts
- Track NDB: disbursement volumes, capitalization changes, credit ratings and member borrowing terms.
- Monitor ICT deliverables: technical agreements, cybersecurity cooperation, standards harmonization and procurement linkages.
- Revisit the BRICS Cable question: any revival, alternative proposals, private‑sector consortia or regional cable partnerships and procurement documents.
- Assess statistical convergence: compare successive joint statistical publications for methodological harmonization and data quality.
- Space cooperation: review technical agreements for the satellite‑data sharing mechanism, data access protocols and concrete applications (agriculture, disaster relief).
- Legal‑diplomatic watch: follow ICC‑related cases, host‑state obligations and precedent‑setting decisions emerging from BRICS summits.
- Institutional outputs: survey Business Council and Think Tanks Council projects for policy harmonization or concrete business deals.

12. Policy recommendations (concise)
- Treat BRICS results as pragmatic and incremental: prioritize engagement in areas with clear mutual benefits (development finance, data sharing, business/academic networks).
- Be cautious on sensitive strategic projects: large infrastructural and aerospace ambitions require binding financing, export‑control workarounds and clear governance frameworks before commitments.
- Leverage NDB and institutional networks: use them to mobilize finance and expertise for India’s infrastructural and development priorities.
- Protect normative commitments: ensure that diplomatic choices (e.g., host‑state obligations, international legal norms) are consistent with India’s long‑term rule‑based multilateral posture.
- Build domestic capacity: invest in India’s statistical, ICT and space capabilities to maximize the payoff from BRICS cooperation while safeguarding national security standards.

13. Conclusion
BRICS’ “other initiatives” reveal a dual character: constructive institutionalization that produces useful, incremental deliverables; and recurring limits caused by finance, technology controls and political heterogeneity. For India, BRICS offers instruments compatible with a strategic culture that prizes autonomy, multilateral engagement and pragmatic cooperation. The Group’s future influence will depend less on declaratory summitry and more on the NDB’s financing clout, the operationalization of technical accords (statistics, ICT, satellite data), and the capacity of members to reconcile legal obligations with geopolitical solidarities. Analysts and policymakers should therefore watch concrete implementation indicators rather than rhetoric when judging BRICS’ substantive impact on India’s national security and strategic options.

## BRICS and Conflict Diplomacy: What Its Statements Mean for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Summary
- BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has repeatedly discussed a range of armed conflicts and humanitarian crises—Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan, Haiti, Syria, Ukraine—signalling engagement beyond purely economic cooperation.
- At the third BRICS summit, leaders discussed NATO air strikes in Libya (2011), an early marker of BRICS scepticism toward Western military interventions.
- In 2023, with South Africa holding the BRICS chair, President Cyril Ramaphosa publicly condemned the Gaza war—an instance of a chair using the platform to foreground a humanitarian-political issue.
- In 2024, BRICS foreign ministers issued a joint statement criticising Israel’s attacks in Gaza—an example of collective diplomatic language on a high-profile crisis.

Context and explanation
- Institutional character: BRICS is an association of major emerging economies convening at leaders’, foreign-ministers’, and ministerial levels to coordinate on economic and political matters. It is not a formal alliance with binding policy instruments.
- Scope of engagement: The repeated discussion of conflicts demonstrates BRICS’ willingness to engage in political and humanitarian diplomacy, reflecting its claim to represent Global South or alternative perspectives in international debate.
- Sovereignty and intervention: The Libya discussion (2011 NATO intervention) became a focal point for BRICS critique of external military intervention, underscoring shared concerns—across diverse members—about sovereignty, regime change, and the precedent set by humanitarian intervention when allied with military force.
- Collective signalling: Public condemnations and joint communiqués show how BRICS can coordinate diplomatic positions. Even when language is cautious, such statements amplify non-Western perspectives and help shape the contours of international discussion.

Chronology and key events (select)
- Third BRICS summit: Deliberations included critiques of NATO’s intervention in Libya—a formative moment that linked BRICS rhetoric to debates on intervention and sovereignty.
- 2023 (South African chair): President Cyril Ramaphosa publicly condemned the Gaza war, using the BRICS chairmanship to project humanitarian concerns onto the BRICS stage.
- 2024: BRICS foreign ministers released a joint statement condemning Israel’s military actions in Gaza—an instance of the bloc producing a unified diplomatic position on an acute crisis.

Implications and significance (for India and the international system)
- Amplifying alternative narratives: BRICS statements broaden the range of legitimate diplomatic narratives beyond Western frameworks. For India, participation in such collective messaging advances its interest in a multipolar order where Global South perspectives are visible.
- India’s balancing role: India’s membership sits at the intersection of competing partnerships (Russia, China, Western democracies). That BRICS can issue joint statements—despite members’ divergent priorities—indicates limited scope for consensus-building that India has to navigate carefully in its foreign policy.
- Sovereignty principle reinforced: BRICS’ emphasis on non-intervention and state sovereignty resonates with India’s longstanding strategic culture and legalist approach to international order; using BRICS to denounce unilateral military interventions helps India uphold these norms without direct confrontation with Western powers.
- Influence on multilateral fora: Given that BRICS members include influential UN Security Council actors, coordinated BRICS messaging can shape debates and voting dynamics at the UN, constraining or reframing Western-led initiatives—an arena where India pursues a principled, multilateralist approach.
- Humanitarian diplomacy as soft power: Chairmanship-driven statements (e.g., South Africa 2023) show how individual members can use BRICS to promote humanitarian concerns. For India, this signals both an opportunity to lead on issues consonant with its strategic culture and a risk that chair-driven agendas may not reflect deep bloc consensus.

Limitations and constraints
- Heterogeneity of interests: BRICS is ideationally loose and compositionally diverse. Divergent national priorities (for example, Russia’s security agenda versus India’s balancing act) limit the depth and boldness of collective positions.
- Lowest-common-denominator language: Statements tend toward cautious or diplomatically hedged formulations; what reads as consensus may simply be the least objectionable phrasing acceptable to all members.
- Non-binding nature: BRICS declarations are political signals, not legal commitments. The grouping lacks an operational foreign-policy architecture (no collective command, no enforcement mechanisms), so statements rarely translate into coordinated action.
- Chairmanship effects: Public pronouncements can reflect the priorities of the current chair rather than an emergent institutional stance—making some statements episodic rather than structural.
- Diffusion of focus: Covering a wide array of crises risks diluting BRICS’ ability to act meaningfully on any single issue.

Recommendations for monitoring (for analysts of India’s strategic posture)
- Track language and frequency: Systematically monitor BRICS joint statements for changes in tone, specificity, and frequency. A shift from generic condemnation to specific remedial proposals or naming of perpetrators would indicate deeper consensus.
- Observe UN voting patterns: Compare BRICS statements with members’ votes and interventions at the UN Security Council and General Assembly to assess whether rhetoric is reflected in multilateral behaviour—especially important for India as it seeks greater UN influence.
- Watch enlargement dynamics: Monitor how BRICS enlargement (initiatives announced in 2023 onward) alters internal cohesion. New members with distinct regional priorities can change bargaining dynamics and India’s leverage within the group.
- Look for follow-through: Note whether statements are accompanied by concrete actions—humanitarian aid coordination, offers to mediate, or joint development assistance—or remain rhetorical. Actionable engagement would signal institutional maturation.
- Map bilateral tensions onto bloc diplomacy: Assess how bilateral disputes among BRICS members (e.g., India–China competition) influence collective messaging; this helps determine how much India can rely on BRICS as a forum to advance its security and normative preferences.

Conclusion: Relevance to India’s strategic culture and policy
BRICS functions as a diplomatic platform through which India can project a Global South voice, reinforce principles of sovereignty and non-intervention, and hedge between rival great-power influences. Its statements on crises—whether about Libya in 2011 or Gaza in 2023–24—offer India opportunities to align humanitarian signalling with its longer-term aspiration for a multipolar, rule-based order. Yet the grouping’s heterogeneity, non-binding nature, and chair-driven episodicity mean India will continue to treat BRICS as one of several tools in a broader strategic repertoire rather than as a substitute for bilateral diplomacy, formal alliances, or UN-centred multilateralism.

### 7.x BRICS Expansion (2023–2024): Process, Politics and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Introduction
- Between August 2023 and October 2024 BRICS underwent a visible phase of outward expansion that was both procedural and performative. Announced as a major step to widen the bloc’s Global South base, the expansion was implemented in a staggered, politically contingent fashion. For India — a founding BRICS member — the episode presented both opportunities for enhanced South–South cooperation and challenges to established strategic calculations. This section traces the expansion’s timeline, analyses its substance and symbolism, and draws out implications for Indian strategic culture and national security policy.

Timeline and salient events
- August 2023 (BRICS 15, Johannesburg): South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced invitations to six emerging-market countries — Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — with an expectation (announced then) that they would become full members effective 1 January 2024.
- November–December 2023 (Argentina): A change in domestic politics — Javier Milei’s victory in Argentina’s November general election — led the incoming government to reconsider and then withdraw its accession. Argentine Foreign Minister Diana Mondino confirmed on 30 November 2023 that Argentina would not join; formal notification of withdrawal followed on 29 December 2023. This illustrates how national electoral outcomes can abruptly alter multilateral accession plans.
- January 2024 (partial accession): Four of the six invited states — Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the UAE — proceeded to join BRICS, increasing formal membership from five to nine. Saudi Arabia did not join at that time and announced its decision was pending (still unresolved as of April 2024).
- October 2024 (partner-tier outreach): BRICS invited an additional 13 countries to participate as “partner countries” — Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, Uganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Partner status was presented as a lower-commitment avenue for engagement; whether any of these were simultaneously offered or intended for immediate full membership was not made explicit.

Political dynamics that shaped outcomes
- Domestic politics: Argentina’s withdrawal is the clearest example that accession is not solely a multilateral choice — individual national elections and partisan shifts can be decisive.
- Geopolitical balancing: Saudi Arabia’s hesitation reflects trade-offs between possible economic and political benefits from BRICS and its strategic dependencies and relationships with Western partners and regional actors.
- Sanctions sensitivity: Iran’s accession is geopolitically salient because it joins while under Western sanctions — a development with potential ramifications for finance, trade routings and diplomatic signalling.
- Staggered, contingent implementation: The expansion approach combined a public announcement with flexible, case-by-case follow-through, producing an incremental timeline (announcement → expected accession → partial accession → partner invitations).

Institutional mechanics and the emergence of a layered membership model
- BRICS lacks a single, formalized accession treaty applied uniformly; membership processes are negotiated politically among members. The October 2024 creation of a “partner” tier signals a deliberate move toward layered relationships (full members vs partners), enabling the bloc to broaden influence without immediate full-membership obligations.
- Existing institutional tools, notably the New Development Bank (NDB), provide mechanisms through which new members can be integrated operationally — but deeper integration requires political agreement on capitalization, governance changes and lending priorities.

Soft power, media framing and the narrative of multipolarity
- Member states have actively used domestic and state-controlled media to frame expansion as evidence of Global South endorsement for a multipolar order. For example, China Daily portrayed growing interest among developing countries in joining BRICS, thereby helping to legitimise expansion in global public discourse.
- This framing serves both symbolic aims (an alternative to Western-dominated institutions) and practical aims (attracting partners for trade, finance and diplomatic support).

Key implications — regional balance, sanctions, and cohesion
- Geopolitical weight and regional representation: Moving from five to nine formal members strengthened BRICS’ presence in Africa and the Middle East (Egypt, Ethiopia, UAE, Iran) and thus its geographic and economic reach.
- Sanctions and financial architecture: Including members under Western sanctions (notably Iran) increases pressure on global financial channels and creates incentives within BRICS to explore alternative payment and settlement systems and trade arrangements that mitigate sanction effects.
- Policy cohesion and decision-making: Greater membership diversity raises the prospect of divergent foreign-policy priorities within BRICS. Differences on regional issues, ties to Western states, and domestic constraints could complicate consensus-building.
- Flexible outreach via partner tier: The partner model allows BRICS to scale influence and technical cooperation while postponing the political strain of immediate full membership expansion.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s strategic culture prizes non-alignment, strategic autonomy and diversified partnerships. BRICS expansion tests and reinforces these tenets:
  - Opportunity to deepen South–South economic ties: New African and Middle Eastern members expand markets, energy partnerships and infrastructure cooperation — areas of interest to India’s economic security and overseas project footprint.
  - Diplomatic leadership and agenda-setting: As an original member, India can shape BRICS’ agenda on development finance, counter-terrorism, supply chains and digital governance, aligning them with its strategic priorities.
  - Balancing act: Inclusion of Iran and closer ties with Russia and China within an expanding grouping require careful calibration to avoid undermining India’s security partnerships with Western countries or its regional policies (e.g., relations with Gulf states, West Asia strategy).
  - Defence and intelligence concerns: Greater BRICS diversity complicates intelligence-sharing and defence alignments; India must assess whether new BRICS engagements produce information benefits or operational frictions.
  - Economic security and financial architecture: India should evaluate the NDB’s evolution, alternative payment systems and any BRICS-led mechanisms that could affect India’s trade finance and sanctions exposure.

Policy recommendations and watch-list for Indian policymakers
- Verify legal accession: Monitor official accession documents and ratifications for each new member rather than relying on media accounts; clarify member rights and obligations.
- Track NDB developments: Watch changes in the New Development Bank’s capital structure, membership rules and lending priorities as signals of deeper institutional integration.
- Monitor practical cooperation: Attend to concrete outputs — summit declarations, working-group deliverables, energy and trade agreements, and pilot schemes for alternative payments — to differentiate rhetoric from actionable alignment.
- Assess regional geopolitical spillovers: Examine how BRICS expansion reshapes alignments in the Middle East and Africa (energy, maritime routes, counterterrorism cooperation).
- Evaluate domestic politics in candidate states: Treat national elections and leadership transitions as decisive variables in accession trajectories.
- Prepare calibrated engagement with partners: Use the partner tier as a forum for selective cooperation (science and technology, capacity building) while preserving strategic autonomy; avoid automatic alignment on positions that conflict with India’s core security interests.
- Anticipate Western responses: Analyze likely Western policy options (diplomatic outreach, incentives, counter-coalitions) toward prospective BRICS members and prepare responses that secure Indian interests.

Concluding assessment
- The 2023–2024 BRICS expansion is best understood as both a practical widening of a cooperative club and a symbolic project aimed at repositioning global governance. For India, the expansion offers material benefits — deeper South–South ties, enlarged markets, and institutional platforms — while imposing diplomatic and strategic management challenges. India’s response must be guided by its strategic culture of autonomy and calibrated engagement: exploit opportunities for economic and diplomatic gain, shape institutional evolution (notably the NDB), and maintain flexibility to navigate the heterogeneous political orientations of an enlarged BRICS.

### 7.X Indonesia’s Accession to BRICS (6 January 2025): Context, Content and Strategic Implications

Synopsis
- On 6 January 2025 Indonesia formally became a full member of BRICS, the bloc that began as BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) and later included South Africa. Indonesia is the first Southeast Asian state to join BRICS and the organization’s 11th member. Jakarta’s accession had been approved by the grouping in 2023 and was formally requested by Indonesia after its 2024 presidential election. Brazil, holding the BRICS rotating presidency in 2025, made the public announcement—President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva performed the visible ceremonial role. Parallel partnership arrangements announced earlier also entered into effect in January 2025; for example, Nigeria became a designated BRICS partnership country on 17 January 2025 (a different, more limited relationship than full membership).

Chronology and procedural notes
- 2009: External observers first floated the possibility of Indonesia being associated with a BRIC-style grouping—sometimes labelled informally as “BRICI”—given its large and growing economy and its evolving ties to existing BRICS members.
- 2023: BRICS leaders gave approval in principle to Indonesia’s membership bid as part of a widening-enlargement phase that began in 2023.
- 2024: Indonesia waited until after its presidential election to make a formal request to join—an important domestic legitimacy step.
- 6 January 2025: Official accession as full BRICS member announced by Brazil’s president (the 2025 BRICS presidency holder).
- January 2025: Several earlier partnership arrangements entered into force.
- 17 January 2025: Nigeria accepted as a BRICS partnership country (not a full member).

Why Indonesia matters to BRICS
- Geographic and demographic reach: Indonesia brings BRICS into Southeast Asia for the first time and adds another very large population and regional economy to the grouping, thereby strengthening BRICS’ claim to represent populous emerging-market states of the Global South.
- Economic rationale for Indonesia: Jakarta seeks enlarged market access, enhanced investment flows, infrastructure financing opportunities (notably potential access to the New Development Bank), and diversification of external economic relationships beyond Western-led financial institutions.
- Historical ties easing integration: Indonesia’s bilateral relationships—especially with India and China—reduce the political frictions of admission and provide pre-existing channels for collaboration within BRICS.

Significance for regional and global politics
- Expansion as Global South strategy: The enlargement continues BRICS’ posture—since 2023—of constructing a more inclusive platform for the Global South that can provide alternatives or complements to Western-dominated governance fora (e.g., G7, dominant IMF governance structures).
- Southeast Asia and ASEAN-BRICS dynamics: Indonesia’s entry creates a new institutional conduit between BRICS and ASEAN; it may encourage deeper engagement by other Southeast Asian states and reshape regional diplomatic alignments.
- Symbolic and practical signaling: Lula’s announcement and the visible role of host-presidency countries underscore how presidency rotation is used for agenda-setting and expansion diplomacy within BRICS.

Partnerships v. full membership
- Institutional differentiation: BRICS has used “partnership” categories to formalize relations that stop short of full membership. Partnerships (as with Nigeria on 17 January 2025) typically imply fewer institutional rights and obligations and serve as a flexible pathway for deepening cooperation without immediate full integration.
- Functional consequences: Being a partner likely affords cooperation opportunities (dialogues, sectoral projects) but not the full governance voice or automatic access to all institutional mechanisms that full members exercise.

Why the timing mattered for Indonesia (domestic politics)
- Legitimacy and continuity: Indonesia delayed formal accession until after its 2024 presidential election—an indicator that domestic political consensus and parliamentary/elite buy-in mattered for a major foreign-policy shift.
- Domestic expectations: Jakarta will face pressure to translate membership into tangible benefits—investments, infrastructure projects, trade deals—and public opinion and legislative approval will shape how the government frames BRICS membership.

Operational questions and what to monitor
- Decision-making with an expanded membership: How will BRICS manage collective decision-making as it grows more diverse numerically and regionally? Consensus norms may be strained, and new procedures or institutional adjustments could be required.
- Access to BRICS finance mechanisms: Will Indonesia (and partnership countries) receive immediate or conditional access to instruments such as the New Development Bank and other cooperative financing vehicles? What governance seats or voting rules apply?
- Legal and operational structure of partnership arrangements: The degree of formalization—MOUs, treaty-type agreements, observer rights—will affect the practical depth of cooperation.
- Measurable outcomes: Track concrete post-accession deliverables—investment announcements, NDB-financed projects in Indonesia, bilateral trade arrangements among BRICS members, energy and commodity cooperation, and supply-chain initiatives.

Potential economic and strategic effects
- Trade and investment: Membership can spur greater intra-BRICS trade, preferential commercial linkages, and coordinated investment projects, especially in infrastructure and energy.
- Strategic footprint in Southeast Asia: Indonesia’s addition enhances BRICS’ presence in a strategically important maritime and economic region; it may offer alternative institutional ties to Southeast Asian states.
- Leverage in great-power competition: For Indonesia, BRICS membership can be used to diversify strategic partnerships and gain bargaining leverage with major powers by broadening its external options.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Continuity of India’s role: India, as an original BRIC member, will evaluate enlargement in light of its preference for multilateral platforms that amplify emerging-market voices without creating zero-sum blocs. Indonesia’s accession can be read as congruent with India’s strategic culture that values multipolarity and regional balance.
- Opportunities:
  - Enhanced regional networks: India gains an institutional partner inside ASEAN via Indonesia that can be leveraged for economic and maritime-security cooperation under multilateral auspices.
  - Economic cooperation: Deeper BRICS ties could facilitate trade, investment, and infrastructure cooperation between India and Indonesia and open new avenues for New Development Bank projects.
- Challenges and caveats:
  - Influence dilution: A larger and more heterogeneous BRICS could dilute India’s relative influence within the bloc, particularly if new entrants align differently on contentious geopolitical issues.
  - Strategic ambiguity: While BRICS is not an alliance aimed at military confrontation, India must manage the optics of deeper cooperation among countries with varied strategic relationships—especially India’s complex ties with China and Russia.
  - Domestic political expectations: Indian policymakers will watch whether BRICS enlargement produces concrete economic benefits or simply symbolic gains, shaping their willingness to invest political capital.

Concluding assessment
- Indonesia’s accession on 6 January 2025 is both symbolic and substantive: it extends BRICS into Southeast Asia and strengthens the bloc’s claim to Global South representation, while raising practical questions about governance, finance access, and operational depth. For India, the enlargement offers strategic opportunities—stronger regional linkages, economic cooperation, and support for multipolarity—while presenting governance and influence-calibration challenges that will shape its national-security posture and multilateral diplomacy going forward. The key metric of success will be whether enlargement produces tangible projects and institutional reforms that translate into development and stability outcomes for member and partner states alike.

## Statistical Overview of BRICS and the Expanded BRICS+:
Context, Key Metrics and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

This section synthesizes disparate statistical claims about BRICS and the expanded BRICS+ grouping into a compact, interpretive analytic brief. It is written for policymakers, strategic analysts and scholars of India’s strategic culture who need a rigorous, data‑aware grounding in the group’s demographic, economic, technological and geopolitical significance. Where figures are drawn from different reference years or mix the original five BRICS members with a wider BRICS+ membership, those inconsistencies are highlighted and explicit caveats are provided.

1. Geographic and demographic scale
- Scale: BRICS+ accounts for roughly 46% of the world’s population and about 25% of global land mass (figures attributed to the expanded grouping rather than the original five).  
- Strategic significance for India: sheer demographic weight amplifies political influence in negotiations on migration, climate, and multilateral governance. For India’s strategic culture, demographic scale shapes both soft‑power projection and resource diplomacy (food, energy, migration).

2. Long‑term economic growth and size (nominal vs PPP)
- Growth: Aggregated BRICS growth metric cited as a rise of 356.27% between 1990 and 2019 (long‑run expansion driven largely by China and India).  
- Shares of global GDP: Multiple PPP figures appear in source material — 32% (BRICS, 2022), 35.6% (BRICS+, 2022) and a broadly cited 36% for expanded BRICS+. These differences reflect mixing of membership definitions and year/measurement choices; PPP generally elevates the relative size of emerging economies compared with nominal USD measures.  
- China’s dominance: Within BRICS+ GDP (PPP) China represents approximately 52% of the total — a reminder that aggregate BRICS/BRICS+ figures are heavily weighted by China. Analysts should disaggregate China when assessing other members’ capacities and trajectories.  
- Ambiguity to resolve: A reported group economic size of US$28.5 trillion appears in the sources without clear specification of whether it is nominal or PPP; such ambiguity materially alters interpretation and must be resolved before policy use.

3. Trade, intra‑group commerce and currency usage
- Intra‑BRICS trade: US$614.8 billion in 2022 (intra‑group trade is substantial but far from self‑contained).  
- Currency composition: The renminbi reportedly accounts for about 47% of intra‑BRICS trade settlement — a significant signal of RMB internationalization and the potential for partial de‑dollarization in regional transactions.  
- Policy implication: For India’s external economic policy, the growing RMB share underscores the need to develop comparable facilities for rupee settlements and to manage exchange‑rate and liquidity risks in a multi‑currency regional environment.

4. Foreign direct investment and reserves
- FDI: In 2017 BRICS accounted for about 19% of global investment inflows. By 2020, the largest foreign investor stocks into the bloc reportedly came from the United States and the United Kingdom — illustrating strong cross‑bloc economic interdependence even amid growing strategic competition.  
- Reserves: Combined foreign reserves for the original BRICS were around US$5.2 trillion as of 2024 — a substantial liquid asset base relevant to balance‑of‑payments resilience and sovereign policy options.

5. Wealth concentration and urban wealth geography
- Wealth profiles: The grouping reportedly contains 4,716 “centi‑millionaires” and 549 billionaires. Note: “centi‑millionaire” is not a standard wealth classification in academic literature and should be defined (presumably persons with net worth ≥US$10 million). Clarity of thresholds is necessary for comparative wealth analysis.  
- Urban concentration: Among the ten richest cities within the wider group, five are in China, two in the UAE/India region, and one in Russia — reflecting pronounced urban concentration of wealth and the centrality of large metropolises for strategic economic assets.

6. Technology, digital economy and space assets
- Internet users: BRICS countries account for approximately 40% of global internet users — a critical base for digital influence, information operations, and cyber diplomacy.  
- Digital payments (2022): Reported adoption rates are heterogeneous — Russia ~87%, China 86%, South Africa 81%, Brazil 77%, India ~35%. These discrepancies indicate divergent fintech ecosystems, payment infrastructure maturity and levels of formal financial inclusion. India’s lower share is both a challenge (financial inclusion, digital infrastructure) and an opportunity (scope for rapid catch‑up via policy push).  
- Space assets: BRICS+ countries are reported to have over 1,200 satellites in orbit (communications, earth observation, navigation). Satellite capabilities confer civilian and military advantages—surveillance, ISR (intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance), communications resilience and domain awareness.

7. Agriculture and energy production
- Agricultural share: BRICS are reported to contribute roughly 45% of global agricultural products, with shares of staple crops reported as 42% of wheat, 52% of rice and 46% of soybeans. This positions the grouping as central to global food security and commodity markets.  
- Energy: BRICS+ oil production is described as about 30% of global oil output. Energy and food leverage are strategic tools in geopolitical bargaining and resilience planning.

8. Labour markets and informality (2024)
- Informality and participation: Aggregate BRICS+ informality rate cited at 62% with labour force participation around 60.8%. High informality reduces tax bases, weakens social protection systems and complicates productivity measurement — important considerations for defence economics and human capital development in security planning.

9. Military and defence‑relevant economic comparisons with G7
- Comparative snapshot (2024): In aggregate measures BRICS outperform G7 on area (39.7m vs 21.7m km2), population (3.3bn vs 0.8bn), population density (83 vs 37 people/km2), GDP (PPP: 51.6tr vs 48tr) and growth rates (BRICS 4–5% vs G7 1.5–2%). G7 retains advantages in human development (HDI 0.92 vs BRICS 0.734), nominal GDP (45.3tr vs 26.7tr), trade volume and aggregate military expenditure.  
- Forecasts: Economist Intelligence Unit projections cited predict BRICS+ will overtake the G7 in collective economic size sometime after 2045 — a projection sensitive to productivity, demographic and geopolitical assumptions.

10. Data quality, caveats and methodological notes
- Mixed memberships and years: Many statistics conflate the original five BRICS with a larger BRICS+ membership and use different reference years (1990, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2022, 2024). Any analytic use must explicitly state which membership and year apply.  
- PPP vs nominal: PPP measures alter relative size assessments; emerging economies typically gain share in PPP metrics. Analysts should never mix or conflate PPP and nominal USD without caveats.  
- Undefined terminology: Terms such as “centi‑millionaire” are non‑standard; define thresholds and methodology.  
- Source verification: Several claims lack explicit citation in the source brief. Primary references to consult include IMF, World Bank, UN FAO, IEA, ITU, national central banks, and satellite registries (national, and UN OOSA/UNOOSA registry).  
- China’s weight: Given China’s outsized share (≈52% of BRICS+ PPP), present both aggregate and China‑less aggregates to reveal heterogeneity among members.

11. Strategic and policy implications for India
- Geopolitical leverage and governance reform: The demographic and PPP weight of BRICS+ strengthens its potential to advocate institutional reforms in multilateral bodies (IMF quota reform, World Bank governance). India should calibrate demands that align global governance reform with its strategic priorities (voice, development finance access, digital norms).  
- Currency strategy and payment systems: Rising RMB usage in intra‑group trade points to the need for India to deepen rupee internationalization options (swap lines, settlement mechanisms) while managing reserve currency exposure. Promoting interoperable, resilient cross‑border payment rails is a strategic priority.  
- Food and energy security: BRICS/BRICS+ dominance in staples and oil production implies both opportunity (supply partnerships, diversification) and vulnerability (exposure to disruptions). India’s strategic planning must integrate commodity diplomacy, buffer stocks, and cooperation on resilient supply chains.  
- Technology and space cooperation/competition: BRICS+ satellite assets and internet user base offer both cooperative avenues (shared earth observation for climate, disaster management) and competitive challenges (space domain awareness, cybersecurity). India should pursue selective technology partnerships while safeguarding critical capabilities.  
- Developmental gaps and social stability: High informal employment and lower HDI relative to G7 signal development priorities—social protection, skilling, urban governance—that are directly relevant to national security (stability, manpower, economic mobilization).  
- Defence economics and industrial policy: Faster BRICS growth and expanded technological capacity mean India's defence planners must account for shifting industrial competition, potential supply chain realignments, and new markets for defence exports.

12. Recommended analytic follow‑ups (methodology and data)
- Disaggregate reporting: Produce parallel tables for (a) original BRICS five and (b) BRICS+ expanded members with clearly defined membership lists and dates.  
- Standardize metrics: Prepare a harmonized dataset distinguishing nominal USD and PPP measures, with consistent base years and exchange‑rate assumptions.  
- Per‑country breakdowns: For policy utility, produce country‑level time series on GDP (nominal & PPP), foreign reserves, FDI stocks/flows, trade balances, satellite counts, internet penetration and payments adoption.  
- Define wealth categories: Clearly define non‑standard terms (e.g., “centi‑millionaire”) and adopt international wealth thresholds for comparability.  
- Scenario analysis: For strategic planning, run scenarios (baseline, high‑growth, low‑investment, geopolitical‑shock) to test the sensitivity of projections such as the EIU forecast that BRICS+ may overtake G7 after 2045.  
- Source verification: Cross‑check claims with primary data: IMF World Economic Outlook, World Bank WDI, UN FAO for agriculture, IEA for energy, ITU for digital statistics, national central bank balance sheets, and UN/ESA or national space registries for satellite data.

13. Conclusion — how to use these statistics in India’s strategic thinking
The statistical portrait of BRICS/BRICS+ presented here is one of scale, heterogeneity and strategic weight — magnified by China but with multiple domains of independent leverage (agriculture, energy, space, digital users). For India’s strategic culture and national security policy this means two simultaneous priorities: (1) exploit cooperative avenues within BRICS/BRICS+ to advance development, technological collaboration and multilateral governance reform; and (2) strengthen domestic capacities (payments, reserves, defence industrial base, food buffers, space and cyber‑capabilities) to manage competition and asymmetries within the grouping. Robust policymaking demands transparent, disaggregated data, scenario planning and targeted investments in institutional and technological resilience.

Suggested immediate tasks for policymakers: commission a harmonized BRICS/BRICS+ dataset with country‑level series (nominal & PPP), clarify non‑standard terminology in wealth statistics, and use scenario analysis to test strategic assumptions (especially those hinging on China’s centrality and on commodity market stability).

## BRICS: Institutional Practice, Decision-making and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) is a paradigmatic example of a member-driven, intergovernmental formation that privileges flexibility and sovereignty over formal bureaucracy. Its institutional practice — annual leaders’ summits, a rotating presidency, a dense calendar of ministerial and technical meetings, and specialized fora — shapes how members pursue economic, political and security objectives. For a study of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, understanding these modalities is essential: they determine how India can translate grand strategy into cooperative initiatives, finance infrastructure and shape norms without ceding institutional control.

### Annual Summit and Rotating Presidency
- Leaders’ summits are the apex of BRICS governance and are normally held once per year. These summits produce leaders’ declarations that set the political tone, adopt collective initiatives and authorize institutional or programmatic instruments.
- The presidency rotates among member states. Traditionally, the presiding head of state or government during a country’s turn acts as President Pro Tempore (the temporary chair) and sets the agenda for that calendar year, hosts the summit and major meetings, and represents BRICS externally.
  - Note: the procedural detail that the President Pro Tempore is “elected” by heads of state at each summit is commonly stated in public accounts but should be corroborated against BRICS founding declarations or rules of procedure for authoritative citation.[citation needed]

Functions of the President Pro Tempore (typical)
- Agenda-setting for the year and framing priorities.
- Convening and hosting summits, ministerial meetings and flagship events.
- Coordinating follow-up on leaders’ decisions and reporting to members.
- Acting as BRICS’s external interlocutor in relevant multilateral contexts.

Implication: the rotating presidency concentrates agenda-shaping power in the incumbent state for a year. This produces dynamism and allows national priorities to enter the group’s agenda, but it also creates variability in focus and execution.

### Ministerial, Technical Meetings and Working Groups
- BRICS sustains a continuous operational rhythm through ministerial-level meetings (foreign ministers, finance ministers, central bank governors, trade ministers, energy ministers) that translate summit declarations into policy choices and cooperative programmes.
- Technical-level meetings and working groups provide the operational backbone: they manage project implementation, prepare negotiating texts, harmonize technical standards and sustain institutional memory across presidencies. Examples include exchanges among national statistics offices, sectoral technology groups, and health or education working groups.
- Working groups span sectoral areas — technology, culture, education, health, statistics, counter-narcotics — and are crucial for moving from declarations to deliverables.

Implication: although leadership-level consensus is necessary, it is these ministerial and technical fora that constitute the day-to-day machinery of BRICS cooperation. Their effectiveness conditions whether leaders’ ambitions are implemented.

### Specialized Forums: Business and Thought Leadership
- BRICS Business Forum: an official channel to engage the private sector, generate project pipelines, and link public financing with private investment opportunities.
- BRICS Think Tank Council: a network of academic and policy institutions that provides research, policy options and continuity between presidencies.

Implication: these fora broaden BRICS’s constituency beyond government capitals, help build implementation partnerships, and preserve institutional memory through networks even in the absence of a permanent bureaucracy.

### Absence of a Permanent Secretariat: Decentralization and Its Costs
- BRICS deliberately lacks a permanent secretariat or standing headquarters. Coordination is achieved through the rotating presidency, working-group chairs, ad hoc coordinators and intersessional networks.
- Institutional consequence: decentralization preserves member control and flexibility, reduces costs and avoids ceding sovereignty to supranational structures. However, it weakens continuity, diminishes rapid institutional learning, and places a premium on effective handovers and on non-bureaucratic repositories of knowledge (think tanks, the NDB, business networks).

Practical effect: follow-through depends heavily on the quality of working groups, the NDB’s operational capacity and informal networks that sustain cross-presidency institutional memory.

### The New Development Bank and Public–Private Linkages
- The New Development Bank (NDB), established by BRICS in 2014, is a core institutional innovation intended to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in member and other emerging economies.
- A recurring institutional aim has been to link the NDB with the BRICS Business Forum/Business Council so that public multilateral finance can catalyse private sector pipelines and deliverable projects.
- This line of coordination exemplifies BRICS’s hybrid approach: public multilateral instruments working in tandem with private-sector engagement and national implementation mechanisms.

Implication: for India, the NDB offers a mechanism to finance infrastructure projects consonant with national development and strategic objectives, while the business–bank nexus helps mobilize complementary private capital.

### Illustrative Presidencies: How National Priorities Shape the Agenda
- Brazil (2019 Pro Tempore): prioritized science, technology and innovation cooperation; the digital economy; combating transnational crime (organized crime, money laundering, drug trafficking); and closer coordination between the NDB and the BRICS Business Council. Brazil’s focus shows how domestic policy concerns and governance priorities can become collective priorities.
- Russia (2024 Pro Tempore): emphasized promoting intra-BRICS investment to strengthen member economies; cooperation in energy and environmental industries; initiatives for young children (social policy); and raising migration and peacekeeping issues. These priorities reflect Russia’s economic and geopolitical emphases during its presidency.
- Brazil (2025 Pro Tempore): Brazil resumed the presidency in 2025, reintroducing its platform and priorities into the BRICS agenda.

Analytical point: annual presidencies tend to reflect a mix of collective problems and host-country strategic priorities. The consequence is both thematic richness and episodic shifting of emphasis, which can complicate long-term programmatic continuity.

### Observations, Institutional Trade-offs and Implications for India’s Strategy
- Variable agenda, durable networks: rotating presidencies create variability but also encourage each member to contribute signature initiatives. For India, this allows issue ownership (e.g., digital cooperation, counter-terror finance) when New Delhi holds the presidency or leads working groups.
- Decentralization versus continuity: in the absence of a secretariat, India must rely on its diplomatic and bureaucratic networks, think tanks and the NDB to sustain follow-through on initiatives that serve its national security and strategic objectives.
- Public–private implementation: India’s private sector and financial institutions can be important partners through the BRICS Business Forum and the NDB to finance projects with security and development dimensions (connectivity, energy, critical infrastructure).
- Norm-shaping and multilateral posture: BRICS provides India a platform to advance alternative norms on development finance and governance without entanglement in a supranational bureaucracy — a complement to India’s broader multilateral strategy.

### Methodological note on sources
- The procedural assertion about the election of the President Pro Tempore at each summit is widely reported in secondary literature and press accounts, but rigorous academic treatment should verify this against BRICS charter-like instruments, leaders’ declarations or official rules of procedure where available.[citation needed]

Conclusion
BRICS’s institutional design — annual leaders’ summits, a rotating presidency, an expansive ministerial and technical architecture, specialized forums, and a deliberately decentralized administrative model — produces both opportunity and constraint. For India, BRICS is a malleable instrument: it enables agenda-setting, multilateral financing, and alternative norm construction while demanding sustained bureaucratic and networked effort to turn transient political priorities into durable programs relevant to national security and strategic culture.

## Chapter X: BRICS Summits (2009–2026) — Trajectory, Outcomes and Implications for Indian Strategic Culture

Summary overview
- The BRICS leaders’ process, inaugurated as BRIC in 2009 and becoming BRICS with South Africa’s addition in 2011, has convened annually and evolved from a loose political grouping into a more institutionalised forum.  
- Summits recorded here span the inaugural 2009 meeting through a scheduled 2026 summit in India; format shifted to virtual leaders’ meetings during the 2020–2022 COVID‑19 period.  
- Over time the grouping produced concrete institutional instruments (New Development Bank, Contingent Reserve Arrangement, Business and Think‑Tank Councils) while repeatedly emphasising economic coordination, development finance, expanded global representation and experimentation with alternatives to dollar‑centred financial architecture.  
- Recent summits (2023–2025) prioritized expansion of membership, discussion of a BRICS payments system and reserve‑basket proposals, governance of emerging technologies (notably AI), and coordinated stances on trade protectionism — all themes that intersect with India’s strategic culture of strategic autonomy, multilateralism and pursuit of development finance options.

Chronology of summits (concise, analytic)
- 1st (16 June 2009) — Russia (Yekaterinburg; Medvedev). Framed against the global financial crisis: joint statement calling for greater voice for emerging markets and deeper cooperation on trade, food, climate and security. South Africa not yet a member.
- 2nd (15 April 2010) — Brazil (Brasília; Lula). Continued crisis response, discussions on IMF reform and climate change; widened diplomatic outreach (guests included South African President Jacob Zuma and Palestinian representative Riyad al‑Maliki).
- 3rd (14 April 2011) — China (Sanya; Hu). First summit as five members (South Africa joins) — formal transition to BRICS. Focused on member economies’ prospects and greater global representation.
- 4th (29 March 2012) — India (New Delhi; Manmohan Singh). Post‑crisis prosperity strategies; collective development agenda and a telecommunications connectivity initiative (BRICS Cable announced).
- 5th (26–27 March 2013) — South Africa (Durban; Jacob Zuma). Institutional momentum: proposal of the New Development Bank (NDB) and Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA); creation of BRICS Business and Think‑Tank Councils (eThekwini Declaration and Action Plan).
- 6th (14–17 July 2014) — Brazil (Fortaleza; Dilma Rousseff). Signing of NDB and CRA agreements — foundational institutional step toward operational multilateral development and liquidity backstops.
- 7th (8–9 July 2015) — Russia (Ufa; Putin). Joint meeting with SCO and EAEU; emphasized cross‑regional coordination on political and economic issues.
- 8th (15–16 October 2016) — India (Goa; Narendra Modi). Joint summit with BIMSTEC; themes included counterterrorism, climate, and strengthening intra‑BRICS ties (Goa Declaration and Action Plan).
- 9th (3–5 September 2017) — China (Xiamen; Xi). Multi‑regional engagements and forward‑looking vision for BRICS’ role in global governance.
- 10th (25–27 July 2018) — South Africa (Johannesburg; Cyril Ramaphosa). Emphasis on capturing value in rising industries; Johannesburg Declaration focused on economic cooperation.
- 11th (13–14 November 2019) — Brazil (Brasília; Jair Bolsonaro). Theme: “economic growth for an innovative future” — spotlight on science, technology, digital currency and organized crime cooperation.
- 12th (17 Nov 2020; virtual) — Russia (St. Petersburg, virtual; Putin). Joint summit with SCO held by video conference due to COVID‑19; Moscow Declaration emphasised living standards and peace.
- 13th (9 Sept 2021; virtual) — India (New Delhi, virtual; Modi). A year of intense institutional engagement (leaders, foreign ministers, national security advisers, ~20 ministerial meetings)—New Delhi Declaration highlighted deepening institutional workstreams.
- 14th (23 June 2022; virtual) — China (Beijing, virtual; Xi). Notable discussion of a basket‑type reserve currency including BRICS currencies and precious‑metal backing — a high‑profile probe into de‑dollarisation.
- 15th (22–24 Aug 2023) — South Africa (Johannesburg; Ramaphosa). Invitations extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, UAE; plan for invited countries to assume full membership from 1 Jan 2024 subject to acceptance. (Argentina later declined; several states pending as of end‑2023.)
- 16th (22–24 Oct 2024) — Russia (Kazan; Putin). First summit as a nine‑member forum (Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, UAE present as new members per the record); discussions on membership rules and a BRICS payments system; unusually high diplomatic turnout and a very active side meeting calendar.
- 17th (6–7 July 2025) — Brazil (Rio de Janeiro; Lula). First summit with Indonesia as a member; a clear turn toward technology governance (AI regulation) and a coordinated statement condemning trade protectionism (contextual response to new tariffs).
- 18th (2026; scheduled) — India (host; Modi). Annual rotation continues; agenda to be determined — symbolic return of the presidency to India after earlier hosts.

Major themes and their evolution
- Economic coordination and crisis response: BRICS has consistently framed itself as a venue for collective responses to global shocks, from the 2009 financial crisis through pandemic‑era coordination. For India, the forum provides a diplomatic platform to argue for development‑friendly global economic governance.  
- Institution building: From idea to instrument — the NDB, CRA, Business and Think‑Tank Councils, and telecommunication initiatives (BRICS Cable) illustrate deliberate moves to build parallel or complementary mechanisms for development finance, liquidity support and policy exchange. India has been a proactive actor in shaping these instruments, using them to diversify development finance sources and governance influence.  
- Expansion and outreach: The bloc has pursued enlargement to deepen Global South credentials and increase geopolitical weight. India’s posture toward expansion reconciles amplified market/diplomatic reach with concerns about diluting policy cohesion.  
- Alternative financial architecture: Recurrent proposals for a reserve currency basket and a BRICS payments system signal a strategic interest in reducing dependence on the US dollar — politically potent but technically and institutionally demanding. India’s calculus balances interest in “de‑risking” dollar exposure and safeguarding its own currency and macroeconomic stability.  
- Broader issue agenda: Over time BRICS moved beyond macroeconomic questions to address technology (digital currency, AI), security (counterterrorism), and transnational crime — reflecting an agenda more relevant to India’s multifaceted national security concerns.  
- Institutionalisation and year‑round diplomacy: Expanded ministerial tracks and virtual summits during COVID‑19 show BRICS moving toward an all‑season diplomatic architecture rather than a single annual leaders’ moment.

Institutional outcomes (concise appraisal)
- New Development Bank (NDB): Founded and operationalised after the 2013–2014 summit cycle to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects. The NDB provides India an alternative multilateral lender and project finance partner, easing dependence on traditional MDBs for some kinds of projects.  
- Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA): A pooled liquidity instrument intended to provide short‑term balance‑of‑payments support among members; conceptually a backstop complementary to IMF facilities but limited by membership size, funding scale and legal compatibility with members’ domestic frameworks.  
- BRICS Business Council & Think‑Tank Council: Institutionalised links with non‑state actors to deepen economic cooperation and policy harmonisation — useful channels for India to project private sector and expert inputs into multilateral deliberations.  
- BRICS Cable and connectivity initiatives: Announced to improve secure telecommunications and diversify data/communications routes — intersecting with India’s interest in digital sovereignty and secure connectivity.  
- Reserve basket and payments system proposals: High‑visibility political proposals (2022 onward) that indicate intent to explore alternatives to dollar‑centred clearing; implementation remains a complex project involving convertibility, reserve management and central bank cooperation.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic autonomy and multipolar engagement: BRICS offers India a multilateral vehicle consistent with its long‑standing strategic cultural preference for autonomy — a forum where India can pursue diversification of partners and instruments without binding security commitments. BRICS engagements allow India to hedge between Western institutions and China‑led initiatives while advancing an independent development‑security agenda.  
- Development finance and infrastructure diplomacy: NDB and related mechanisms expand India’s toolkit for infrastructure financing, important for domestic development and for India’s external economic statecraft (lines of credit, development projects in its neighbourhood and beyond). These instruments also serve to enhance India’s normative voice on multilateral development governance.  
- Managing heterogeneity and consensus politics: Expansion and widening agenda sets increase political heterogeneity (different economic structures, foreign policy alignments). For New Delhi, this complicates coalition‑building within BRICS on sensitive issues (sanctions, regional conflicts) and demands skillful diplomatic brokerage to preserve strategic interests.  
- Financial de‑risking vs. macroeconomic stability: India’s pragmatic approach is to explore alternatives that reduce transactional friction and vulnerabilities, while avoiding measures that would imperil currency stability or disrupt existing financial channels essential for trade and investment. Operationalising a basket currency or payments system would require sustained central bank cooperation and legal harmonisation — both technically demanding and politically sensitive for India.  
- Technology governance as national security domain: The 2024–2025 focus on AI and digital currencies brings technology governance into BRICS’ remit — an area where India’s domestic policy priorities (data protection, digital public goods, AI governance frameworks) can translate into normative influence and reciprocal capacity‑building. Regulation of dual‑use technologies links directly to national security considerations.  
- Diplomatic networking and global influence: Joint summits with other organisations (SCO, EAEU, BIMSTEC, etc.) and an expanding roster of members increase platforms for India to pursue regional priorities, build issue coalitions and shape norms — but they also create arenas where India must reconcile competing external pressures (Western partners, China, new members with divergent interests).  
- Operational credibility vs. political signalling: Many high‑profile BRICS proposals (reserve currency, payments system) serve as geopolitical signals. India’s interest is in separating talk from implementable policy — monitoring technical feasibility and protecting macroeconomic integrity while capitalising on diplomatic leverage.

Limitations, risks and observables
- Scale and governance limits: NDB and CRA remain smaller in scale than the IMF/World Bank; their capacity to substitute for Bretton Woods institutions is therefore limited. Governance models and lending norms will determine their longer‑run relevance.  
- Membership heterogeneity: Expansion increases the bloc’s market reach but complicates consensus formation, especially on issues touching sanctions regimes, regional conflicts or alignment with major powers.  
- Technical complexity of financial alternatives: A basket reserve currency or standalone payments system requires solving convertibility, liquidity management, creditor protections and central‑bank interoperability — technical and legal hurdles that make rapid implementation unlikely.  
- Technology and norms: BRICS’ move into AI and digital governance creates new normative battlegrounds where India must balance domestic innovation goals, security concerns and international harmonisation.  
- Monitorables: (1) concrete NDB lending volumes and governance changes; (2) legal/textual steps toward a payments system or reserve basket (MOUs, technical working groups, central bank memoranda); (3) BRICS positions in global technology standard‑setting forums; (4) patterns of coordination or divergence on sanctions and regional security questions.

Concluding assessment for India’s policymakers
BRICS is both an instrument and a theatre for India’s strategic culture: it advances multilateral engagement, development finance diversification and normative influence while preserving strategic autonomy. For India’s national security policy the utility of BRICS lies less in rapid institutional replacement of Western systems than in incremental capacity building — widening diplomatic space, accessing complementary finance, shaping emerging norms (AI, digital currencies), and hedging strategically. To extract maximal benefit New Delhi should prioritise (a) technical engagement to validate financial proposals before political endorsement, (b) capacity‑building within NDB/CRA to scale credible alternatives, (c) coalition management to preserve policy space amid enlargement, and (d) translating BRICS technology deliberations into robust domestic governance frameworks that align security, innovation and international normative engagement.

Suggested short checklist for practitioners (what to watch next)
- NDB: annual lending volumes, project portfolios in India’s priority sectors, governance reforms.  
- CRA: activation rules, contribution modalities, interoperability with IMF safeguards.  
- Payments/reserve proposals: establishment of technical working groups, central bank agreements, trial schemes or pilot currencies.  
- Membership dynamics: accession procedures, voting/governance implications, divergence patterns on sanctions/security.  
- Technology governance outcomes: BRICS declarations/standards on AI, data governance and digital currencies and their uptake in international standard‑setting bodies.

(References to summit declarations, NDB/CRA founding documents and country statements are essential for detailed archival work; the above draws on official communiqués and the summit record described in the preceding chronology.)

## BRICS Membership Snapshot — analytical précis for India's strategic outlook

This section analyses a membership table for BRICS that lists ten states (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, United Arab Emirates, Indonesia) with country-level indicators (capital, area, population, density, GDP per capita (PPP), HDI, currency, official languages and accession date). The objective is to translate these raw data and metadata issues into targeted analytic insights relevant to India's strategic culture and national security policy.

### What the table records (columns explained)
The dataset is structured to allow cross-country comparison. Key fields and their analytic significance:

- Country / Formal name — identifies legal/political entity and diplomatic formality.
- Capital(s) — indicates political-administrative centralisation (of note: South Africa’s tripartite capitals).
- Area (km2) — territorial size, relevant for resource base, defence logistics and basing.
- Population (2016) — market size and manpower; note the snapshot year must be made consistent for temporal analysis.
- Density (/km2) — demographic pressure and urbanisation patterns.
- GDP per capita (PPP) — relative economic capacity and standard of living; pertinent to contribution potential in pooled initiatives.
- HDI — human development and socio-economic resilience; relevant for soft-power and security-internal stability assessments.
- Currency — domestic legal tender (should be standardised to ISO codes for technical use).
- Official languages — linguistic diversity and communication/interoperability considerations.
- Accession — date of membership entry (invitation vs effective membership requires clarification).

### Country profiles (concise, drawn from the table)
- Brazil (Federative Republic of Brazil): Capital Brasília; area 8,515,767 km2; population (2016) 203,062,512; density 25/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 22,123; HDI 0.786; currency BRL; official language Portuguese; accession: 16 June 2009 (informal reference to Sept 2006).
- Russia (Russian Federation): Capital Moscow; area 17,075,400 km2; population (2016) 146,519,759; density 8.3/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 47,299; HDI 0.832; currency RUB; official language Russian. (Accession date not listed.)
- India (Republic of India): Capital New Delhi; area 3,287,240 km2; population (2016) 1,284,480,000; density 364.4/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 11,112; HDI 0.685; currency INR; official languages Hindi (Devanagari) and English. (Accession date not listed in the row.)
- China (People’s Republic of China): Capital Beijing; area 9,640,011 km2; population (2016) 1,374,820,000; density 139.6/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 26,310; HDI 0.797; currency CNY; official language Standard Chinese. (Accession date not listed.)
- South Africa (Republic of South Africa): Capitals — Pretoria (executive), Cape Town (legislative), Bloemfontein (judicial); area 1,221,037 km2; population (2016) 58,048,332; density 42.4/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 15,723; HDI 0.741; currency ZAR; 12 official languages; accession: 24 December 2010.
- Egypt (Arab Republic of Egypt): Capital Cairo; area 1,010,408 km2; population (2016) 105,231,000; density 103.56/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 20,799; HDI 0.754; currency EGP; official language Arabic; accession: 1 January 2024.
- Ethiopia (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia): Capital Addis Ababa; area 1,104,300 km2; population (2016) 105,163,988; density 92.7/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 4,045; HDI 0.497; currency ETB; official languages include Afar, Amharic, Oromo, Somali, Tigrinya. (Accession date not shown.)
- Iran (Islamic Republic of Iran): Capital Tehran; area 1,648,195 km2; population (2016) 79,011,700; density 48.0/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 19,607; HDI 0.799; currency IRR; official language Persian. (Accession date not shown.)
- United Arab Emirates (UAE): Capital Abu Dhabi; area 83,600 km2; population (2016) 4,106,427 (table flags inconsistencies); density 49.1/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 77,251; HDI 0.940; currency AED; official language Arabic. (Accession date not shown.)
- Indonesia (Republic of Indonesia): Capital Jakarta; area 1,904,569 km2; population (2016) 282,477,584; density 143/km2; GDP per capita (PPP) 16,542; HDI 0.728; currency IDR; official language Indonesian; accession: 6 January 2025.

### Aggregated observations relevant to India
- Territorial and demographic asymmetries: Russia is the largest by area; UAE the smallest. China and India far outstrip others in population, conferring market and manpower advantages to both — a central factor in India's strategic calculations within BRICS.
- Developmental heterogeneity: GDP per capita (PPP) ranges from Ethiopia (4,045) to UAE (77,251); HDI spans 0.497–0.940. This variance complicates coalition-building around uniform economic or social policy initiatives.
- Density and urban pressures: India’s high population density (364.4/km2) contrasts with vast low-density members (Russia), shaping domestic priorities India brings to group agendas (e.g., food security, urban infrastructure).
- Linguistic and institutional diversity: South Africa’s multiple official languages and Ethiopia’s multilingual profile illustrate the communicative and legal pluralism BRICS must accommodate; for India this underscores the importance of multilingual diplomacy and legal pluralism in group initiatives.

### Data anomalies and methodological cautions
- Accession-date inconsistency: several entries lack accession dates or contain informal/contradictory notes (e.g., Brazil’s “informal 2006” vs 2009; UAE population flagged as “Figures don't balance”). These require cross-checking with BRICS communiqués.
- Temporal mismatch: population column is tagged “(2016)” while accession dates extend to 2025. Mixing snapshot demographic data with evolving membership leads to analytical distortions; a consistent temporal baseline is essential.
- Currency notation: local symbols are used alongside names; for policy analysis and aggregation, ISO currency codes (e.g., BRL, INR, CNY) should be adopted.
- Numerical verification needed: the UAE population/density inconsistency and Ethiopia’s and India’s older population snapshots must be corrected before modelling economic or security scenarios.

### Strategic implications for India’s national security and strategic culture
- Bargaining leverage: India’s demographic and market size enhance its bargaining position within BRICS, but China’s larger per-capita GDP and Russia’s resource weight imply that India must craft coalitions on issue-specific bases (trade, development finance, counter-terrorism).
- Agenda priorities: India is likely to emphasise issues that reflect domestic vulnerabilities — energy and food security, technology transfer, development finance, and pandemic preparedness — while navigating members’ diverse development levels and geopolitical alignments.
- Institutional adaptation: BRICS expansion to include North Africa, the Middle East and Southeast Asia raises the need for flexible institutional mechanisms. India’s strategic culture — which privileges strategic autonomy and multilateral engagement — favours incremental institutionalisation calibrated to preserve national policy space.
- Soft-power and normative leadership: India can leverage language (English), democratic credentials and diaspora linkages to act as a bridge-builder among members with varying governance models.
- Security externalities: The inclusion of Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the UAE broadens BRICS’ geographic reach into strategic maritime chokepoints and littoral zones of relevance to India’s naval and energy-security concerns; India must map how BRICS-level economic cooperation intersects with regional security dynamics.

### Practical recommendations (data and policy)
- Data hygiene: verify accession dates against primary BRICS declarations; update demographic series to a consistent reference year (preferably the latest UN estimates); standardise currencies to ISO codes.
- Resolve anomalies: investigate flagged discrepancies (UAE population) before using the table for modelling or policy prescriptions.
- Enrich the dataset: add columns for membership status (founder vs accretion), primary regional grouping, major exports/strategic sectors, and governance type to support strategic analysis.
- Policy posture: India should pursue issue-based coalitions within BRICS, promote institutional mechanisms that respect strategic autonomy, and prioritise initiatives aligned with domestic development-security linkages (infrastructure financing, supply-chain resilience, climate adaptation).
- Narrative clarity: when using such composite tables in strategic documents, always qualify temporal mismatches and methodological limits to avoid overstating inferences.

Concluding note: the table is a useful starting point for comparative strategic assessment, but its analytical value depends on rigorous data verification, temporal harmonisation and augmentation with political-institutional variables. For India, the BRICS forum remains a venue to project economic and diplomatic influence while protecting national security prerogatives — provided New Delhi calibrates initiatives to the group’s marked heterogeneity.

### The BRICS Financial Architecture: New Development Bank and Contingent Reserve Arrangement — Origins, Design and Strategic Implications for India

Background and genesis
- BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) established two parallel financial instruments at their 2014 summit in Fortaleza, Brazil: the New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). Both instruments were formalized by treaty in 2014 and became operational in 2015, marking a deliberate effort by the grouping to build financial institutions that could offer alternatives or complements to Western‑led multilateral finance (IMF and World Bank).
- The institutions are headquartered and administratively anchored: the NDB’s secretariat is in Shanghai. Operational activation in 2015 entailed initial staffing, capitalization processes and the commencement of lending and reserve‑support mechanisms.

Mandates and functional design
- New Development Bank (NDB)
  - Primary purpose: provide long‑term capital for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS countries and other emerging economies.
  - Operational emphasis: project lending, co‑financing with other multilateral and bilateral lenders, and a growing focus on green and sustainable finance.
  - Initial capital framework: an often‑cited subscribed capital figure around USD 50 billion at founding (the size and paid‑in proportions determine the NDB’s real lending capacity).
- Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)
  - Primary purpose: a pooled reserve mechanism to provide short‑term balance‑of‑payments support and liquidity to BRICS members facing external shocks.
  - Intended role: a safety net complementary to (not a wholesale replacement for) the IMF; designed to reduce members’ reliance on ad hoc bilateral swaps or IMF conditionality in certain circumstances.
  - Aggregate size at inception: committed resources reported around USD 100 billion (subject to member commitments and tranche access rules).

Governance, capital and power asymmetries
- Economic asymmetry: China accounts for roughly 70% of BRICS’ combined GDP. This asymmetry has immediate implications for any capital‑based institution.
- Potential governance consequences:
  - If voting power and control track capital contributions, China’s economic weight could translate into disproportionate influence over lending priorities, risk appetite and strategic orientation in both the NDB and the CRA.
  - Smaller members (including India relative to China) may find their capacity to steer policy limited unless governance structures institutionalize checks—equal representation on boards, veto rights on key decisions, special voting thresholds, rotating presidencies or other balancing devices.
- Institutional safeguards and transparency will be decisive variables: written governance rules, disclosure practices, and the operational independence of professional management can mitigate raw power imbalances but do not eliminate geopolitical leverage born of asymmetric financial exposure.

Operational and policy implications
- Autonomy from Western institutions: the NDB and CRA expand BRICS’ financial options and enhance collective bargaining power vis‑à‑vis Western‑dominated institutions. Their effectiveness, however, depends on:
  - Actual paid‑in capital and callable resources, not just headline subscribed amounts.
  - The robustness of risk management, project selection standards, and procurement and safeguards policies.
  - Speed and predictability of disbursements (especially for the CRA in crisis scenarios).
- Utility limits and coordination issues:
  - The CRA’s stabilizing function hinges on rapid access modalities, appropriate conditionality, and coordination with the IMF and regional arrangements; political frictions or insufficient resources could blunt its crisis‑management value.
  - For the NDB, the project pipeline, co‑financing relationships and sovereign vs. non‑sovereign lending mix will shape developmental impact and reputational standing.

Strategic implications for India’s national security and strategic culture
- Strategic autonomy and diversification: For India, participation in the NDB and CRA supports a longstanding strategic‑culture preference for diversified multilateral options and financial autonomy—allowing New Delhi to pursue infrastructure financing and reserve support without exclusive dependence on Western institutions.
- Risk management and leverage: However, China’s economic predominance within BRICS could create strategic trade‑offs. Excessive Chinese influence in NDB/CRA governance might constrain India’s ability to ensure that projects align with its security and development priorities, or create scenarios where financial decisions are affected by geopolitical considerations outside India’s control.
- Policy response choices for India:
  - Insist on robust governance protections and transparency in institutional rules (voting shares, board composition, project approval processes).
  - Use operational engagement—championing projects, co‑financing with other multilaterals, and promoting high standards for procurement and safeguards—to shape institutional norms.
  - Monitor and, when necessary, diversify funding and reserve partnerships outside BRICS to avoid over‑reliance on mechanisms where China is dominant.

Immediate operational notes
- “Became active in 2015” signals the start of staffing, capitalization steps and first loan/commitment cycles; the real test is subsequent capital calls, cumulative lending volumes, and the geographic composition of approved projects.
- The NDB’s and CRA’s influence on global finance grows with demonstrable delivery: approved project quality, timeliness of CRA disbursements, and transparent operations.

Recommended follow‑up actions and research questions
- Verify current financial facts: updated figures on capital subscriptions, paid‑in capital, callable resources, and cumulative lending/disbursement volumes for the NDB; committed versus available resources and historical drawdowns for the CRA.
- Scrutinize governance texts: voting shares, board structure, veto rights, decision thresholds and safeguards against disproportionate dominance.
- Analyze lending practice: the NDB’s approved project list, sectoral and geographic distribution (are projects concentrated in China? India? elsewhere?), co‑financing patterns and sectoral priorities (infrastructure, green finance, social sectors).
- Monitor membership dynamics: potential BRICS expansion or membership diversification and how such changes would affect governance, capital allocation and institutional legitimacy.
- Examine coordination and contingency frameworks: formal and informal mechanisms for CRA‑IMF coordination, and practical examples (if any) of concurrency or complementarity in crises.

Conclusion (pithy)
The NDB and CRA reflect BRICS’ strategic impulse to institutionalize financial alternatives and increase collective autonomy. For India, they offer useful instruments consistent with a strategic culture that favours diversified engagement and cautious hedging. Yet the institutions’ ultimate impact on India’s national security calculus will hinge on governance design, transparency, operational performance and how effectively India—as a middle power within BRICS—can shape norms and decisions in the face of stark Chinese economic asymmetry.

### Chapter X — The New Development Bank (NDB): Structure, Operations and Strategic Significance for India

Overview
- The New Development Bank (NDB), commonly known as the BRICS Development Bank, is a multilateral development institution established by the five BRICS states — Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging markets and developing countries.
- Although the NDB is formally multilateral, its origin and governance reflect BRICS political economy objectives: generating alternative financing architecture to complement (and in some respects counter-balance) Western-dominated multilateral lenders such as the World Bank.

Identity, mandate and headquarters
- Formal name and membership: The NDB is the BRICS Development Bank, jointly owned and governed by its founding members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Its global headquarters is located in Shanghai, China.
- Primary mandate: The bank’s core operational focus is lending for infrastructure development — broadly construed to include transport, energy, water, urban development and related projects — with an increasing emphasis on sustainable and green projects aligned with development-impact objectives.
- Regional presence: To strengthen African engagement the NDB established an African regional headquarters in South Africa, signaling strategic intent to deepen lending and relationships across the continent.

Capital structure, authorized lending and growth targets
- Founding capital: At inception the NDB’s subscribed capital totaled US$50 billion, with each founding member subscribing US$10 billion — a symmetrical capital stake that established formal financial parity among founders.
- Capital growth plan: The bank envisaged increasing subscribed capital to US$100 billion over time, a plan designed to expand lending capacity and enhance the bank’s balance-sheet capacity to borrow and lend at scale.
- Authorized lending capacity: Operationally the bank has an authorized annual lending capacity reported at up to US$34 billion — an affordability/throughput indicator tied to its capital base, borrowing capacity and retained earnings.

Operational portfolio and scaling (2020–2024)
- Early portfolio (2020): By 2020 the NDB had approximately 53 projects underway with cumulative commitments of around US$15 billion.
- Progress by 2024: By 2024 the bank’s operational portfolio had accelerated — more than US$32 billion had been approved for 96 projects. These figures indicate both quantitative scale-up and faster project approvals.
- Comparative trend and average project size: Between 2020 and 2024 the number of approved or ongoing projects nearly doubled (53 → 96) while cumulative approved financing more than doubled (≈US$15B → >US$32B). The implied average committed value per project rose modestly:
  - 2020 average ≈ US$15B / 53 ≈ US$283 million/project;
  - 2024 average ≈ US$32B / 96 ≈ US$333 million/project.
  This modest increase in average project size suggests both expansion in the number of projects and a slight shift toward larger-financed undertakings.

Membership expansion and geographic strategy
- Broader membership: In 2021 the NDB admitted Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay — a notable enlargement beyond the original BRICS founders. This reflects a deliberate strategy to broaden the shareholder base and to attract Global South borrowers and partners.
- Regional implication: The establishment of an African HQ in South Africa and the expansion of membership signal the NDB’s intention to move from a BRICS club instrument to a more geographically diversified multilateral lender with enhanced outreach in Africa, South Asia and select other regions.

Governance, voting and oversight implications
- Foundational governance: Equal initial subscriptions ($10B each) confer formal parity in capital contribution among founders. The bank is governed through standard multilateral structures (board of governors, board of directors, president/executive management). Equal founding shares imply an institutional design that aims to balance influence among BRICS members.
- Practical governance dynamics: Equal capital stakes create an appearance of equality, but operational influence also depends on informal leadership, administrative location (Shanghai HQ), and diplomatic leverage. The enlargement of membership will complicate voting dynamics and coalition-building inside the bank, as new members alter the shareholder mix and the balance of interests.

Financial instruments, funding strategy and risk management
- Instruments and currency strategy: The NDB has experimented with issuing bonds and lending in local currencies to reduce foreign-exchange risk for borrowers and to diversify its funding sources. Local-currency lending and bond issuance are strategic tools to deepen capital markets in member countries and to lessen dependence on dollar funding.
- Funding sources and capital adequacy: The bank’s authorized annual lending of US$34 billion is enabled by a combination of subscribed capital, callable capital arrangements, retained earnings and market borrowing. The timeline and practical steps to reach the US$100 billion capital target matter critically for the bank’s borrowing capacity and credit standing.
- Risk factors: Key risks include credit risk (sovereign and project-level), concentration risk from a portfolio heavily weighted to infrastructure, environmental and social safeguard challenges, and political/geopolitical risk—particularly when member states themselves are subject to economic coercion or sanctions (e.g., the Russian experience). Operational indicators to monitor include credit ratings, loan disbursement speed, non-performing assets, co-financing ratios, and project outcomes.

Strategic and geopolitical significance — implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic autonomy in development finance: For India, the NDB provides an instrument of strategic autonomy in development finance. It offers an additional financing avenue for India’s domestic infrastructure and for Indian firms’ overseas projects, reducing overdependence on Western-led institutions and bilateral lenders.
- Influence and policy space: India’s equal founding subscription (US$10B) affords it parity on paper with other BRICS founders. This formal parity allows India to shape lending norms, safeguard policies and project priorities within a BRICS-led multilateral context — an important element of India’s broader pursuit of diversified partnerships and multipolar institutional engagement.
- Opportunities: The bank can be leveraged to:
  - finance infrastructure and green transitions consistent with India’s development priorities;
  - support Indian construction, services and green-technology exports;
  - deepen South–South cooperation, especially with African and South Asian borrowers.
- Constraints and strategic cautions:
  - Despite formal parity, China’s economic heft and the Shanghai HQ location can translate into greater informal influence; India must therefore continue to cultivate coalition partners within the NDB and among new members.
  - Exposure to geopolitical tensions among members can complicate operational decision-making and may introduce reputational and credit risks to the bank’s portfolio — an important national-security consideration when Indian projects are co-financed with partners whose external vulnerabilities differ from India’s.
  - The NDB’s open membership and geographic expansion can dilute original BRICS unity on key governance matters, making outcomes more contested and less predictable.
- Security implications: Development finance is an instrument of statecraft. For India’s national security policy, the NDB’s role is twofold: it is a source of economic resilience (through diversified funding) and a venue for projecting influence. India must balance using the NDB to support its strategic economic objectives while guarding against dependencies or entanglements that could constrain policy options under geopolitical strain.

Assessment, monitoring and recommended follow-up data
- Operational metrics to track: credit ratings, audited financial statements, speed of disbursement, non-performing loans, sectoral breakdown of projects (transport, energy, water, urban), co-financing partnerships, and environmental/social safeguard compliance.
- Capital and governance follow-up: details on the timetable and modalities for the planned increase to US$100 billion; rules on callable capital and voting weight; statutes governing admission of new members; and internal risk-management frameworks.
- Strategic monitoring for India: project pipelines in India/South Asia/Africa involving Indian entities; local-currency financing initiatives relevant to INR; bilateral coordination with other multilateral lenders; and contingency planning for geopolitical shocks affecting member states.

Conclusion
- The NDB is a rapidly scaling BRICS-led multilateral bank with an explicit infrastructure and sustainable-development mandate. Its symmetrical founding capital structure, evolving membership, and regional offices (notably the African HQ in South Africa) mark it as a prominent new node in the Global South’s development-finance architecture.
- For India, the NDB presents an opportunity to diversify financing, project portfolios and geopolitical partnerships; it also creates governance arenas where India must actively engage to protect its strategic and development interests. Close monitoring of the bank’s financial trajectory, governance evolution and operational risk profile is therefore essential to align NDB engagement with India’s strategic culture and national security priorities.

Suggested immediate archival checks (for researchers and policymakers)
- NDB audited financial statements and annual reports (for up-to-date portfolio and balance-sheet metrics).
- NDB statutes and governance documents (board composition, voting rules, capital-calling provisions).
- Project-level database (sectoral and country breakdown).
- Credit-rating agency assessments and market issuance records (for funding-cost analysis).
- Official statements or strategy documents from India’s Ministry of Finance/Ministry of External Affairs on NDB engagement.

## The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA)

Overview
- The Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) is a multilateral financial backstop created by the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) to provide short-term liquidity support to members facing balance-of-payments problems or currency pressures arising from global financial volatility. Framed as a South–South cooperative mechanism, the CRA is both a pragmatic crisis-management instrument and a political statement: it operationalizes an alternative, regionally driven safety‑net to the traditional Bretton Woods institutions.

Purpose and scope
- Primary purpose: offer contingent credit lines and swap-like resources to stabilize national currencies and restore external balance when members are hit by exchange‑rate disturbances, capital flight or broader global liquidity shocks.
- Types of threats addressed: acute exchange‑rate pressure, sudden capital outflows, and short-term liquidity mismatches that, if unchecked, can amplify macroeconomic instability and compromise national security through economic dislocation.
- Temporal focus: short‑to‑medium term liquidity provision rather than long-term structural adjustment financing.

Historical and institutional genesis
- The CRA was formally established by a Treaty signed in Fortaleza in July 2014, reflecting BRICS’ post‑global financial crisis impulse to build autonomous instruments of financial cooperation.
- Ratification and entry into force: the treaty entered into force following ratifications by the member states; BRICS announced completion of ratification at the 7th BRICS Summit (July 2015), marking the legal standing of the arrangement.
- Early governance meetings: the inaugural meetings of the CRA Governing Council and the Standing Committee were convened as described in the founding documents (noted in the institutional record as having met on 4 September 2015), moving the CRA from treaty text to operational design.
- Companion institution: the New Development Bank (NDB), established by the same BRICS initiative, complements the CRA as part of a broader architecture for development finance and crisis management.

Governance and organizational design
- Core organs: the CRA is governed by a Governing Council (the principal policy body) and a Standing Committee (responsible for more frequent technical and operational matters). This structure balances political oversight with a smaller, operational secretariat‑style committee for rapid decision-making.
- Decision-making reflects negotiated concessions among members; governance arrangements, including voting modalities and access rules, are calibrated to reflect asymmetric contributions and political sensitivities among BRICS partners.

Mechanics of support and access
- Instrumentation: the CRA provides contingent lines of credit — functionally similar to currency swap lines — that can be drawn upon when a member faces balance‑of‑payments strain.
- Activation and conditionality: the arrangement’s usability depends on clear activation criteria, access limits, and any conditionality attached to disbursements. Technical rules—timing, documentation, and coordination mechanisms—determine whether the CRA can deliver assistance rapidly when markets punish a currency.
- Practical use: in theory, the CRA can be used as an immediate liquidity buffer to stabilize markets, and in practice it may be deployed either alone or in coordination with IMF programs, depending on political choices and the scale of the shock.

Size, contributions and quota dynamics
- Initial scale: at launch, the CRA was announced with a committed size of approximately US$100 billion. This figure signalled intent but also limited the CRA’s capacity relative to global systemic needs.
- Asymmetric contributions: member shares are unequal—China provides the largest share, while members such as South Africa commit smaller amounts. This distribution affects both the absolute amounts available to each country and the political economy of access (influence over rules and perceptions of ownership).
- Quota implications: uneven commitments shape quota entitlements and possible constraints on borrowing; they also raise questions about moral hazard, influence, and the bargaining power of larger contributors.

Relationship with the IMF and other institutions
- Competitor and complement: the CRA was designed partly as an alternative to Western‑dominated institutions like the IMF, embodying a desire for financial autonomy among emerging economies. Yet in practice it can complement IMF programs by providing immediate liquid support while IMF conditionality and medium‑term programs are negotiated.
- Practical coordination: successful crisis response may require formal or informal cooperation with the IMF (data sharing, program design, conditionality alignment), especially if shocks exceed the CRA’s resources.

Limitations, critiques and operational constraints
- Scale limitations: with an initial size far smaller than available IMF resources for large crises, the CRA cannot by itself substitute for the IMF in systemic events.
- Dependence on rules and political will: effectiveness hinges on timely access, transparent activation criteria, credible conditionality where needed, and the political willingness of members to disburse funds quickly—any of which can be bottlenecks.
- Perception and credibility: markets’ confidence in the CRA depends on demonstrated use and timely delivery; without early and visible deployments its deterrent value may be limited.
- Governance tensions: asymmetries in contribution can translate into influence imbalances, raising concerns about equitable access and decision‑making fairness.

Strategic and policy implications for India
- Financial autonomy and diversification: participation in the CRA supports India’s strategic preference to reduce over‑reliance on a Western‑centric financial architecture, giving New Delhi an additional sovereign buffer against external shocks.
- Operational utility: for India, a CRA line provides an insurance mechanism that can be drawn upon in periods of volatile capital flows—an important complement to its foreign exchange reserves and domestic policy tools.
- Currency and regional stability: the CRA’s emphasis on South‑South cooperation aligns with India’s interest in stable regional financial linkages and greater use of local currencies in trade and finance, potentially lowering exchange‑rate transmission risks.
- Strategic calculus: India must weigh benefits (additional liquidity options, political leverage, multilateral solidarity) against costs (potential policy conditionality, governance arrangements shaped by larger contributors, reputational implications if support is politicized).
- Policy integration: for maximal utility, India should engage in shaping access rules, ensure interoperability with IMF processes when necessary, and pursue transparency and predictable activation criteria to enhance the CRA’s credibility.

Conclusion
- The BRICS CRA is a significant institutional innovation that encapsulates the emergent preference among major emerging economies for autonomous, cooperative mechanisms to manage external shocks. While it neither replaces the IMF nor can it, by itself, fully insure members against deep systemic crises, it strengthens the BRICS toolkit for crisis management, advances South–South financial cooperation, and offers strategic benefits for members such as India—provided operational rules, timely access and political commitment are sustained.

### Chapter excerpt: BRICS, SWIFT alternatives and implications for India’s strategic culture

Summary
- At the 2015 BRICS Summit in Russia, ministers initiated consultations on creating a payment-system alternative to SWIFT. The initiative’s primary stated aim was to enable cross-border settlements in members’ national currencies rather than relying on a single dominant currency (implicitly the US dollar).
- Russia framed the alternative as a redundancy and back-up in case SWIFT access were disrupted. This was reinforced by Russia’s prior development of the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) after 2014 sanctions-related access concerns.
- China operates the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), oriented to RMB/CNY clearing and messaging for international yuan transactions. CIPS provides some of the messaging/clearing functionality associated with SWIFT for yuan flows, but it is not a one-to-one global replacement for SWIFT.
- India maintains the Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS) for domestic interbank messaging; while capable technically of secure messaging, SFMS is primarily a domestic infrastructure and not currently a broadly-adopted global SWIFT substitute.
- Brazil’s Pix is a fast, retail instant-payment infrastructure for domestic, real-time transfers (launched 2020). While it demonstrates modern digital-payments design, it should not be taken as a direct cross-border SWIFT alternative without careful qualification [citation needed].

Clarifications and corrections
- CIPS: purpose-built to facilitate and streamline cross-border RMB settlement and messaging. It has expanded since the mid-2010s but is tailored to RMB flows; it does not replicate all of SWIFT’s universal correspondent-banking network or global market infrastructure.
- SFMS: a robust domestic interbank messaging network for India. SFMS can support secure bank-to-bank messaging and could form a component of cross-border arrangements, but in its existing footprint it is not a fully developed, widely-adopted cross-border clearing alternative.
- SPFS: Russia’s response to potential exclusion from SWIFT; it enables domestic and some limited international message routing, but its reach and correspondent connectivity are far smaller than SWIFT’s.
- Pix: highly effective for Brazil’s domestic retail payments and financial inclusion objectives. Assertions equating Pix to SWIFT are misleading; Pix does not perform the global correspondent and high-value clearing functions that characterize SWIFT.
- Several claims in public commentary have required contextual qualification (hence the “citation needed” tag in some sources). Timelines: SPFS development accelerated after 2014; CIPS expanded through the 2010s; Pix was launched in 2020.

Strategic implications for India (and like-minded states)
- De-dollarisation and resilience: developing or joining alternatives reduces relative dependence on SWIFT and the U.S.-centred dollar-clearing ecosystem. For India, greater capacity to settle in national currencies could reduce exposure to exchange-rate pressures and the political dimensions of dollar-clearing.
- Hedging against sanctions and political leverage: redundant rails can lessen vulnerability to extraterritorial sanctions or sudden exclusion from dominant messaging systems. India must weigh the benefit of operational resilience against diplomatic and commercial costs.
- Fragmentation risk: a proliferation of national/regional rails could fragment global payment networks, increasing friction in multilateral trade unless interoperability standards are established. India’s trade and financial services integration depend on low-friction cross-border rails; fragmentation could raise transaction costs.
- Sanctions, AML/CFT and global cooperation: SWIFT currently occupies a central position in global surveillance for AML/CFT and sanctions enforcement. Alternative systems that lack equivalent compliance frameworks could complicate India’s obligations under FATF and its own strategic interest in tackling illicit finance.
- Strategic balancing: India’s strategic culture — which balances autonomy, non-alignment instincts and integration into global finance — suggests a cautious approach: pursue preparedness and selective linkages rather than abrupt decoupling from dominant systems.

Operational challenges
- Interoperability: aligning message standards, APIs, settlement-finality rules and legal frameworks across CIPS, SPFS, SFMS and others is technically possible but legally and politically complex. Without common standards, cross-system traffic will be limited and cumbersome.
- Liquidity and convertibility: settling in national currencies requires convertibility, deep FX markets, or currency swap lines and regional liquidity arrangements. India would need to cultivate swap lines and liquidity pools to underwrite expanded use of INR in settlement.
- Compliance and supervision: effective AML/CFT, sanctions-screening and correspondent-banking compliance must be embedded across systems to maintain trust and preserve access to global correspondent banking.
- Network effects and adoption: SWIFT’s value is its ubiquity. New systems face an adoption barrier: banks prefer the network that connects to most counterparties. Convincing global banks to hold INR liquidity and use non-SWIFT rails will be slow and costly.
- Governance and trust: participants require transparent governance, predictable dispute-resolution mechanisms and assurances that systems remain operational under political stress. Absent this, counterparties will hesitate to rely on alternative rails.

Recommendations and pragmatic next steps for India
- Prioritise interoperability standards: work bilaterally and through BRICS/other multilateral fora to harmonise message formats and settlement rules (technical APIs, ISO messaging variants, legal finality clauses).
- Build liquidity arrangements: negotiate bilateral and multilateral currency-swap lines, and consider a regional liquidity pool to underwrite INR settlement in targeted corridors; use phased pilots before scaling.
- Strengthen compliance frameworks: ensure AML/CFT, sanctions-screening and KYC standards in any linked systems meet or exceed global norms to preserve correspondent relationships with major banks.
- Pilot linkages, not grand unified networks: pursue pilot bilateral linkages (for example SFMS–CIPS messaging pilots, or SFMS-enabled INR corridors) to test operational, legal and commercial feasibility before attempting a single unified BRICS payment network.
- Legal and regulatory alignment: assess and modify domestic regulations to permit central-bank settlement finality for cross-border uses and clarify liabilities, custodial rules and oversight roles.

Citation and evidentiary notes
- CIPS: active since the mid-2010s with progressive expansion focused on RMB internationalisation; it is a specialised tool for RMB settlement rather than a full SWIFT equivalent.
- SPFS: developed by Russia in response to threat of SWIFT disconnection post-2014; provides domestic resilience and limited international links.
- SFMS: India’s domestic interbank messaging system; technically capable but currently domestically oriented.
- Pix: a domestic instant-payment system in Brazil (launched 2020); its technical success does not equate to being a SWIFT-class global correspondent messaging system — further evidence would be required to sustain such a claim.
- Caution: popular and policy discourse sometimes conflates diverse payment technologies and policy intentions. Distinguish between domestic retail rails, national messaging systems and global correspondent infrastructures when assessing strategic consequences.

Concluding observation
For India, the relevant strategic choice is not simply whether to abandon SWIFT but how to cultivate options: resilient, interoperable alternatives; targeted currency-settlement corridors supported by liquidity arrangements; and compliance-assured linkages that protect India’s economic security while expanding its strategic autonomy.

## Chapter X — BRICS Monetary Integration: Proposals, Technical Design and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

At the 2023 BRICS summit in South Africa, member states tasked technical and financial authorities to study the feasibility of a common currency or equivalent settlement arrangements. That decision has spawned multiple, overlapping ideas — from infrastructure-centric proposals (BRICS Bridge) to symbolic or supranational currency concepts (R5, UNIT). For Indian policymakers, these developments intersect directly with core elements of strategic culture: sovereignty, economic autonomy, and a preference for gradual, pragmatic institutionalism. This section unpacks the main proposals, their technical design features, feasibility constraints, and the political-economic implications for India’s national security and foreign economic policy.

1. Overview of proposals and objectives
- Primary goals: facilitate fairer, lower-cost trade and investment among BRICS members; reduce dependence on a single external reserve/invoice currency; and create payment rails supportive of growing intra-BRICS economic activity.
- Two broad strands:
  - Infrastructure-first: BRICS Bridge (successor to MBridge/BRICS PAY) — an interoperable cross-border interbank payment and settlement layer intended to enable CBDC-based or tokenized settlement among central banks and commercial intermediaries.
  - Currency or unit-of-account proposals: a symbolic R5 (a name referencing the five national currencies: renminbi, ruble, rupee, real, rand) and third‑party private/institutional schemes such as UNIT (proposed by IRIAS), a supranational coin backed 40% by physical gold and 60% by selected fiat assets.

2. BRICS Bridge: design principle and operational contours
- Concept: an automatic Cross‑Border Interbank Payment System enabling settlement and clearing that central banks may support with their own wholesale CBDCs.
- Foundational design principles:
  - Independence: infrastructure should not be controlled by any single member state or central bank; governance must be multilateral.
  - Sovereignty safeguards: each central bank would retain discretion to opt out of specific transactions and manage its CBDC’s exchange rate; this preserves national policy autonomy but complicates a single-currency design.
- Operational model: wholesale CBDC rails for bank‑to‑bank settlement, with messaging standards, liquidity facilities (pooled or bilateral), and settlement finality rules. BRICS Bridge is positioned as an alternative to correspondent banking and SWIFT dependency for intra-BRICS flows.

3. Currency proposals: R5 and UNIT
- R5:
  - A normative label for a BRICS common unit derived from the five national currencies. Public symbolism (e.g., a commemorative banknote shown in Kazan) underscores political intent but not institutional commitment.
  - Two models: (a) a full currency union (rare given political constraints), or (b) a regional unit of account/settlement token used for invoicing and cross‑border clearing.
- UNIT (IRIAS proposal):
  - A supranational coin concept with decentralized minting by qualified nodes (states or private institutions). Backing proposed at 40% physical gold and 60% fiat-basket, with coins denominated in a gold-equivalent unit.
  - Design issues: nodes deposit assets, minting is permissioned, and governance is distributed—this is not an official BRICS initiative but is illustrative of private/institutional alternatives that could facilitate trade settlement without creating a centralized monetary authority.

4. Technical feasibility and requirements
- CBDC architecture:
  - Wholesale CBDCs are the pragmatic starting point for cross‑border settlement due to stronger KYC/AML controls and clearer settlement finality than retail CBDCs.
- Interoperability standards:
  - Harmonized APIs, messaging protocols and settlement finality definitions are essential to link distinct central-bank systems.
- Liquidity and market infrastructure:
  - Intraday liquidity facilities, pooled reserves or bilateral swap lines, and market‑making capacity are necessary to prevent settlement gridlock and manage FX volatility.
- Auditability and reserves:
  - Proposals with asset backing (e.g., UNIT’s gold component) require independent audits, tamper-proof reserve ledgers, and clear custody arrangements, otherwise credibility will suffer.
- Resilience and security:
  - Cybersecurity, incident response and fallback settlement mechanisms must be built in; distributed designs must include robust governance for node failures or legal disputes.
- Phased pilots:
  - A staged rollout—bilateral or corridor pilots focused on specific flows (e.g., commodities, energy, or selected interbank corridors)—is the prudent technical path to validate interoperability, liquidity management and AML/CFT procedures.

5. Institutional, legal and governance challenges
- Monetary sovereignty:
  - Member states face divergent inflation targets, business cycles and exchange‑rate regimes. A credible single currency would require deep policy convergence or the surrender of domestic monetary tools—politically unlikely for BRICS members.
- Supranational institutions:
  - A durable settlement unit or currency would need an overseeing clearing authority or supranational central bank, rules for reserve pooling, and credible enforcement—arrangements that are politically and institutionally demanding.
- Legal harmonization:
  - Cross‑border CBDC use requires coordinated KYC standards, AML/CFT regimes, data protection laws, taxation rules and dispute-resolution mechanisms.
- Governance of decentralized minting:
  - Private or permissioned nodes raise questions of qualification, audit, liability and dispute settlement. Who audits node reserves? What liabilities attach to misissuance?
- Exchange‑rate management and opt‑out provisions:
  - Allowing central banks to control exchange rates while participating in shared rails preserves sovereignty but creates risks of temporary misalignments, competitive devaluations and market fragmentation.

6. Economic and geopolitical implications — relevance to India
- Trade facilitation:
  - Reduced FX friction and transaction costs could deepen intra‑BRICS trade and Indian participation in regional value chains (e.g., commodities, agriculture, pharmaceuticals). India could gain from lower settlement costs in strategic import‑heavy sectors.
- Reserve-currency dynamics:
  - Diversification away from dollar/euro invoicing and settlement is possible over time, with implications for global demand for reserve assets. For India, greater currency diversification can reduce vulnerability to dollar liquidity or sanctions-related pressures.
- Geopolitical signaling:
  - A successful BRICS settlement system is a signal of financial multipolarity and can bolster India’s strategic ambition to hedge over-concentration of Western-led financial infrastructure.
- Market disruption and spillovers:
  - Shifts in invoicing or reserve patterns, if abrupt, could increase FX and sovereign bond volatility—India would need contingency FX and liquidity facilities.
- Sanctions and compliance considerations:
  - Systems perceived as instruments to bypass sanctions are likely to invite pushback from established reserve-currency states. Indian banks and multinationals will weigh reputational and second‑order legal risks when engaging with new rails.

7. Feasibility assessment and major risks
- Technical feasibility is plausible for a CBDC‑interoperability layer (BRICS Bridge) but scaling to a full currency union is politically and institutionally unlikely in the near term.
- Principal risks:
  - Inadequate governance and transparency (especially for gold or asset-backed proposals).
  - Insufficient liquidity and market depth for a new unit to achieve smooth price discovery.
  - Regulatory fragmentation that impedes commercial bank participation.
  - External pushback or secondary sanctions that reduce correspondent banking appetite.
  - Cyber and operational risks that could undermine confidence during critical episodes.

8. Recommendations for Indian policy — aligning strategic culture with practical policy
- Pursue a pragmatic, phased approach:
  - Prioritize operational infrastructure (participation in BRICS Bridge pilots, CBDC interoperability tests) rather than immediate endorsement of a supranational currency.
- Targeted pilots:
  - Begin with use-cases aligned with India’s trade priorities (e.g., energy imports, key commodity corridors, or interbank settlement for remittances and invoicing in rupees).
- Governance and transparency:
  - Insist on robust governance, independent audits, and transparent dispute resolution—especially for any basket/gold‑backed arrangements—to protect India’s reputational and financial security.
- Preserve sovereignty while enabling utility:
  - Negotiate opt‑out and exchange‑rate provisions that allow India to retain monetary policy autonomy but minimize unilateral behaviors that could destroy the unit’s credibility.
- Regulatory coordination:
  - Drive harmonization of AML/CFT, KYC, tax and data‑protection standards across participating members to lower compliance friction for Indian banks and corporates.
- Modeling and stress-testing:
  - Undertake comprehensive scenario analysis and stress tests (drawing lessons from the eurozone about asymmetric shocks and fiscal transfer tensions) to assess risks to India’s macroeconomic stability.
- Diplomacy and signaling:
  - Use diplomatic engagement to clarify that infrastructural alternatives are intended for legitimate trade facilitation; proactively mitigate international perceptions that could result in countermeasures.

9. Technical considerations for implementation (brief)
- Wholesale CBDCs should be the technical priority for cross‑border settlement because they better accommodate KYC/AML and central‑bank control.
- Establish interoperability standards (APIs, message formats), liquidity arrangements (swap lines, pooled intraday facilities), and settlement finality rules before scaling.
- Ensure auditability and reserve transparency for any asset‑backed features; consider independent custodians and cryptographic reserve registries.
- Design robust incident-response and contingency settlement fallbacks to manage cyber incidents or node failures.
- Adopt a staged rollout: bilateral corridor pilots → multilateral pilots → expanded commercial participation.

10. Terminology (glossary)
- BRICS Bridge: Proposed cross‑border payment infrastructure to link BRICS CBDCs and interbank settlement systems; an evolution of MBridge/BRICS PAY concepts.
- CBDC: Central Bank Digital Currency; digital form of central bank money. Distinction matters: wholesale CBDCs (bank-to-bank) vs retail CBDCs (public-facing).
- MBridge / BRICS PAY: Earlier BRICS payment proposals/initiatives that inform the Bridge concept.
- R5: Informal shorthand for a BRICS common unit tied conceptually to the five national currencies (renminbi, ruble, rupee, real, rand).
- UNIT (IRIAS): A non-official proposal for a decentralized supranational coin backed 40% by gold and 60% by fiat assets, minted by permissioned nodes.
- Financial multipolarity: The diffusion of global financial influence away from a single dominant reserve currency toward a plurality of systems.

11. Conclusion — strategic implications for India
The feasible near‑term outcome is not a euro‑style monetary union but an interoperable settlement infrastructure that reduces transaction costs and offers selective currency diversification. For India, participation in BRICS Bridge‑type pilots aligns with a strategic preference for pragmatic institution‑building that enhances autonomy without premature surrender of policy tools. Success will hinge on technical interoperability, credible governance, and careful diplomacy to manage external political risks. Indian national security strategy should thus treat BRICS monetary initiatives as both an opportunity to deepen economic resilience and a domain demanding calibrated safeguards — from auditable governance to robust contingency planning — befitting India’s commitment to sovereign control and strategic hedging in a multipolar world.

## BRICS Declarations on Conflict, Humanitarian Issues and Counter‑terrorism:
Kazan (16th Summit, October 2024) and Brazil (17th Summit, 2025) — implications for India’s strategic culture

Context and provenance
- The source material for this section was flagged as “needs expansion” (edit‑request note dated July 2025), indicating that publicly available summaries (e.g., online encyclopaedia entries) remain incomplete and undersourced.
- An image caption frequently associated with coverage of the Kazan summit reads “Kharkiv, Ukraine after the Russian attack on 30 October 2024,” underscoring why Ukraine and the principle of the UN Charter figured prominently in summit language. The presence of such imagery helps explain the diplomacy‑first framing adopted by BRICS leaders.

Kazan Declaration (16th BRICS Summit, Oct 2024): main elements
- Reaffirmation of the UN Charter: The Kazan Declaration emphasized adherence to the UN Charter and to multilateral, institution‑based responses to interstate conflict. This reflects BRICS’ common preference — across a politically heterogenous membership — for resolving disputes through established multilateral forums rather than unilateral measures.
- Diplomacy‑first approach to Ukraine: The declaration supported diplomatic efforts to end hostilities in Ukraine, signalling a preference for negotiation and mediation over coercive or military escalation in interstate disputes.
- Humanitarian concern in the Middle East: The declaration expressed “deep concern” about the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territory, noting escalations of violence in Gaza and the West Bank and attendant civilian harm and displacement. It also recorded alarm at hostilities in Southern Lebanon and called for immediate cessation of hostilities there. Notably, the text foregrounded humanitarian consequences without allocating explicit legal or political blame in the quoted passages.
- Critique of unilateral sanctions: The Kazan text highlighted adverse impacts of unilateral sanctions on the global economy and on progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a recurring BRICS critique of Western sanctions regimes perceived as extraterritorial and economically distortive.

Brazil Summit (17th BRICS Summit, 2025): peace, security and the terrorism agenda
- India’s counterterrorism concerns amplified: At the Brazil summit’s Peace and Security session, BRICS reiterated and amplified concerns that aligned closely with India’s long‑standing counterterrorism priorities.
- Condemnation of the Pahalgam attack: BRICS adopted a resolution condemning the 22 April 2025 Pahalgam attack, stating it “condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir.” The resolution’s sponsor(s) and the dynamics by which this specific incident entered the BRICS agenda are important contextual details for understanding how bilateral security issues become multilateralised.
- Broad formulation of counterterrorism targets: The declaration called for combating terrorism “in all its forms and manifestations,” and specifically named cross‑border movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens as priorities for action. While Pakistan was not named in the text, Indian diplomatic sources and media widely interpreted references to cross‑border terrorism as implicitly directed toward Islamabad.
- Rejection of double standards and call for “zero tolerance”: BRICS urged “zero tolerance” for terrorism and “rejected double standards in countering terrorism,” signalling member frustration with selective or politicised applications of the terrorist label.
- Push for a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT): The declaration called for the “expeditious finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism in the UN framework” and advocated concerted action against UN‑designated terrorists and entities.

Analytical observations — what these declarations reveal about BRICS and India’s strategic posture
- Multilateralism as default: Emphasis on the UN Charter and UN‑based responses shows BRICS’ collective preference for institutionalised, multilateral mechanisms. For India, this aligns with a strategic culture that privileges rule‑based multilateralism as a constraint on great‑power unilateralism and as a venue to internationalise national security grievances.
- Platform for internationalising bilateral disputes: The Pahalgam condemnation demonstrates how BRICS functions as a forum for members to place bilateral security concerns on an international stage. India’s success in securing explicit denunciation of the attack shows skillful use of multilateral formats to reinforce domestic security narratives and to mobilise normative pressure.
- Balancing sovereignty and humanitarian language: The Kazan and Brazil texts show BRICS attempting to thread a middle path — emphasising state sovereignty and diplomacy (e.g., on Ukraine) while simultaneously employing humanitarian language (e.g., Gaza, West Bank, Southern Lebanon). This balance reflects the coalition’s internal heterogeneity and India’s own strategic calculus of supporting diplomatic resolution while signalling concern for civilian suffering.
- Sanctions critique and developmental framing: Recurrent criticism of unilateral sanctions ties security policy to development outcomes — BRICS members portray extraterritorial sanctions as impediments to global trade and SDGs. For India, this linkage supports an argument that security and economic resilience are mutually reinforcing.
- Ambiguity as a diplomatic tool: The decision not to name Pakistan explicitly, while denouncing cross‑border terrorism, illustrates how ambiguous multilateral language can be deliberately employed to secure consensus among diverse members while still allowing concerned parties to claim a diplomatic gain. Such ambiguity can also produce varied external readings and diplomatic friction.
- CCIT and the limits of consensus: BRICS’ call for expeditious finalisation of the CCIT aligns with longstanding debates at the UN, but the CCIT has historically stalled on definitional issues (e.g., distinguishing terrorism from legitimate political struggle). That BRICS prioritised it signals political will, but progress depends on broader consensus in the UN and the positions of major powers.

Diplomatic fallout and interpretive dynamics
- Implicit targeting generates reaction: Because the Brazil language on cross‑border terrorism was widely read as implicitly directed at Pakistan, it likely produced diplomatic responses from states implicated or concerned about precedent. Ambiguity can thus internationalise bilateral tensions even when texts avoid explicit naming.
- Domestic signalling: For India, securing BRICS condemnation of an attack on its territory serves domestic political and strategic ends, reinforcing the government’s counterterrorism narrative and legitimacy.

Gaps, evidentiary needs and recommendations for improving public accounts
The “needs expansion” tag on public summaries is warranted. To make an academically rigorous account, the following should be added:
- Primary sources: Insert direct links to the full texts of the Kazan Declaration (16th Summit) and the Brazil Peace & Security resolution (17th Summit), including verbatim paragraphs cited. Official BRICS summit web pages and national foreign ministry releases are primary references.
- Member positions and consensus dynamics: Document which members moved specific language, any textual compromises, statements made in summit communiqués or leader‑level remarks, and whether declarations were adopted by consensus or with reservations.
- Incident background and sponsorship: Provide a concise factual background to the Pahalgam attack (date, casualties, claimed perpetrators where available) and identify which BRICS member(s) pushed for the formal condemnation.
- Reactions by implicated states: Record responses from Pakistan and other affected states to show diplomatic consequences and to assess whether the BRICS language had tangible policy effects.
- Status of the CCIT: Summarise the CCIT’s negotiating history at the UN, the principal points of contention (notably definitional disagreements), and why a BRICS push matters for momentum and deadlines.
- Implementation and follow‑up: Note any concrete follow‑up actions pledged by BRICS (e.g., humanitarian assistance to Gaza, mediation offers, intelligence cooperation, mechanisms for sanction coordination) and whether any joint operations or funding commitments were established.
- Composition and expansion effects: Clarify BRICS composition at these summits (including any new members or invited states) and assess how expansion altered the group’s tone or bargaining dynamics.
- Independent analysis: Cite think‑tank and academic analyses (e.g., from IISS, Chatham House, Brookings, ORF or academic journals) that evaluate geopolitical implications for South Asia, the Middle East, UN counterterrorism negotiations and sanctions regimes.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Utilisation of multilateral venues: India’s use of BRICS to place the Pahalgam incident on an international platform is consistent with a strategic culture that leverages multilateralism both for normative contestation (e.g., opposing selective definitions of terrorism) and for reputational reinforcement.
- Diplomacy as primary instrument, force as deterrent: The Kazan diplomacy‑first framing and Brazil’s counterterrorism push together typify India’s dual approach: a preference for diplomatic multilateralism combined with assertive counterterrorism measures when national security is implicated.
- Norm entrepreneurship and coalition building: India’s insistence on “zero tolerance” and on completion of the CCIT signals an attempt to shape norms within global counterterrorism governance, using like‑minded coalitions where interests align.

Suggested primary and secondary sources to consult (researcher checklist)
- Official texts: Full Kazan Declaration (16th BRICS Summit), full Brazil summit Peace & Security session resolution (17th BRICS Summit), national statements by India, Pakistan and other BRICS members.
- UN material: Negotiating history and current status of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.
- Independent analyses: Policy briefs and articles from leading international affairs institutes (IISS, Chatham House, Brookings, Observer Research Foundation) that assess BRICS’ evolving security agenda and implications for South Asia.
- Media and diplomatic reporting: Reactions from Pakistan and other implicated states; contemporaneous reporting on the Pahalgam attack.

Concluding remark
The Kazan and Brazil declarations illustrate how BRICS has become a multifaceted forum for reconciling divergent member priorities: asserting multilateral norms (UN Charter), raising humanitarian concerns without explicit attribution, and creating space to internationalise national security incidents such as the Pahalgam attack. For India, BRICS offers both a venue to amplify counterterrorism priorities and a multilateral shield against unilateral measures perceived as illegitimate — a twin strategy that is emblematic of contemporary Indian strategic culture.

## Reception

BRICS’s reception in scholarship, policy circles and international organisations is marked by a dual narrative: on the one hand a recognition of its potential as a platform for alternative governance and development initiatives; on the other hand, persistent scepticism about its cohesion and practical effectiveness. For India’s strategic culture and national security policy this ambivalence matters — it shapes how New Delhi engages the grouping, what it seeks to advance within BRICS, and how it manages the tensions that attendance at such a heterogeneous club inevitably produces.

### Internal divisions and structural heterogeneity
BRICS is a deliberately heterogeneous grouping. Its members differ in political systems, strategic outlooks, economic size and development levels. This structural diversity is a source of political appeal — it affords broad representation and legitimacy for an alternative multilateral architecture — but it also complicates consensus-building. Analysts routinely identify internal divisions and weaknesses as central constraints on BRICS’s capacity to act as a unified actor on contested diplomatic or economic questions.

Key manifestations of this heterogeneity include:
- Divergent economic cycles and vulnerabilities that limit the scope for common fiscal or monetary action.
- Different stakes in existing international institutions (for example, China and Russia are permanent UN Security Council members, while India, Brazil and South Africa are aspirants).
- Varied domestic regulatory frameworks and governance capacities that hinder harmonisation of policy commitments.

### Economic instabilities and institutional implications
Economic instability among one or more BRICS members is a significant vulnerability for collective initiatives. Fluctuations in growth, fiscal stress, currency volatility or sudden policy shifts can:
- Undermine confidence in BRICS-led financial mechanisms such as the New Development Bank (NDB).
- Reduce the appetite for deeper intra-BRICS trade and currency arrangements.
- Deter external investors who view institutional reliability as a function of member stability.

For India, where economic statecraft is increasingly intertwined with strategic policy, the prospects and limits of the NDB and other financial instruments must be calibrated against the macroeconomic health of partner states.

### Diplomatic frictions: UN Security Council reform and bilateral disputes
Two categories of diplomatic friction are particularly salient.

1. UN Security Council reform
   - Reform is a long-standing BRICS talking point, but achieving a common position is difficult because members’ interests are asymmetric. China and Russia, as current permanent members, have fundamentally different incentives compared with aspirant members such as India, Brazil and South Africa. These divergent stakes make coherent BRICS advocacy on Security Council reform cumbersome and politically sensitive.

2. Bilateral territorial disputes
   - The India–China border dispute is the exemplar of an unresolved bilateral tension that spills into multilateral settings. Historical grievances and periodic escalations along the Line of Actual Control create an environment of distrust that complicates India’s readiness to align on broader BRICS initiatives involving China. Such bilateral problems constrain the grouping’s ability to present unified diplomatic positions.

### How frictions affect BRICS effectiveness and credibility
Political and economic frictions have concrete effects:
- They reduce the group’s ability to present unified positions on global governance topics.
- Internal disagreements diminish the effectiveness of BRICS-led initiatives — whether financial, diplomatic or development-oriented — by slowing decision-making or producing only lowest-common-denominator outcomes.
- The perception of disunity undermines external credibility and can affect investor confidence in BRICS instruments and projects.

### Targeted cooperation: space governance as a pragmatic avenue
Space cooperation emerges in analyses as a promising area for pragmatic, technically-oriented BRICS collaboration. The sector offers outputs with direct civil and development payoffs (earth observation, climate monitoring, disaster management) and soft-power gains, while being easier to frame as technical/scientific rather than high-politics.

Potential forms of BRICS space cooperation include:
- Joint normative or regulatory frameworks (e.g., debris mitigation standards).
- Collaborative science missions and shared satellite programmes.
- Satellite data-sharing arrangements for climate, agriculture and disaster-response applications.
- Capacity-building initiatives and technology-exchange programmes.

Caveats: space is not apolitical. Many space activities have dual-use implications (military and civilian), raising concerns about strategic sensitivity, data security, intellectual property and verification. Effective cooperation will therefore require carefully designed data-sharing protocols, IP arrangements, and confidence-building measures.

### Targeted cooperation: labour, social policy and ILO engagement
BRICS has also advanced coordinated language on labour and employment. The joint declarations and statements of BRICS Labour and Employment Ministers — which address decent work, social dialogue, green jobs, skills development and worker protection — have won positive reception from the International Labour Organization. ILO Director-General Guy Ryder’s favourable response highlights a degree of convergence between BRICS social-policy statements and international labour norms, and opens an institutional pathway for technical cooperation.

Opportunities and limits:
- The ILO can translate BRICS declarations into technical programmes, capacity-building and monitoring mechanisms, offering a channel to move from rhetoric to practice.
- Implementation, however, faces obstacles: disparate national labour standards, differing fiscal capacities, and varying political commitments to social protection across BRICS members mean national-level follow-through will be uneven.

For India, alignment with ILO norms via BRICS offers both reputational benefit and tangible technical support for domestic labour reforms and skills initiatives — provided there is political will and budgetary provision to convert commitments into programmes.

### Monitoring indicators and pragmatic risk assessment
To assess BRICS’s trajectory and the viability of sectoral cooperation, attention should be paid to concrete indicators:
- Frequency and specificity of BRICS communiqués containing measurable commitments rather than aspirational language.
- Financing allocations and disbursement through the New Development Bank and other BRICS financial mechanisms.
- Bilateral steps toward dispute management or de‑escalation (notably India–China agreements on confidence-building).
- Launch and scale-up of concrete pilot projects in space cooperation (satellite data-sharing, joint missions) and labour-sector programmes in partnership with the ILO.

Potential risks include:
- Expansion of BRICS membership that amplifies political diversity and slows decision-making.
- Political shocks among member states that cascade into institutional paralysis.
- Strategic mistrust in dual-use sectors (e.g., space) that curtail meaningful cooperation.

At the same time, targeted sectoral cooperation — limited, technically framed and insulated from high-politics — offers a pragmatic pathway for incremental integration.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
BRICS presents a set of strategic choices for India:
- Compartmentalisation: India can emphasise compartmentalised cooperation (space, labour, development finance) to derive practical benefits while keeping contentious bilateral issues at bay.
- Strategic hedging: Participation provides leverage in multilateral conversations (e.g., UNSC reform) without committing India to a monolithic bloc position that could constrain its independent diplomacy.
- Domestic translation: India should seek to translate BRICS commitments (on green jobs, skills, space cooperation) into funded domestic programmes, exploiting ILO and NDB partnerships for technical and financial support.
- Risk management: New Delhi must weigh reputational and economic gains from BRICS initiatives against the risks posed by China–India rivalry and broader geopolitical shifts.

### Conclusion
The reception of BRICS is best understood as a balance between fault lines and focused opportunities. Geopolitical divergence, economic instability and bilateral disputes limit BRICS’s capacity to act as a fully coherent geopolitical actor. Yet pragmatic, technical domains — notably space governance and labour/social policy cooperation through the ILO — provide realistic venues for cooperation where mutual interests overlap and where results can be demonstrable. For Indian strategic planners, the path forward is one of selective engagement: leveraging BRICS where it complements national objectives, pushing for concrete deliverables through institutional channels, and remaining vigilant about the structural constraints that will continue to shape the grouping’s reach and effectiveness.

## BRICS, the Global South and Western Responses: Late‑2024 Commentaries and Implications for India’s Strategic Culture

In late 2024 three influential think‑tank commentators — Christian E. Rieck, Alicia García‑Herrero and Reinhold Brender — published assessments of BRICS that crystallise key debates about its internal dynamics, external appeal and strategic significance. Their analyses are instructive for understanding India’s strategic culture and national‑security posture because they highlight (a) the asymmetries within BRICS, (b) the organisation’s attraction to parts of the Global South, and (c) the dilemmas the West (and the EU in particular) face when responding. The following section synthesises their core arguments, situates them in institutional and geopolitical context, and draws out implications for Indian strategy and for Western — notably European — policy.

1. Source and timing
- The three commentaries appeared in late 2024 and addressed BRICS’ enlargement, geopolitical posture, and nascent financial architectures. They reflect contemporary policy debates rather than historical evolution, so they are especially useful for assessing near‑term strategic choices.

2. Christian E. Rieck: “4+1”, Chinese primacy and calibrated Western responses
- Central framing: Rieck characterises BRICS as a “4+1” configuration: four members and one overwhelmingly dominant actor — China. This shorthand captures China’s disproportionate economic and diplomatic weight inside the grouping and the resulting asymmetry in agenda‑setting.
- China as driver of enlargement: Rieck argues China has been the principal engine behind BRICS expansion — using membership and outreach to amplify its governance preferences and to underwrite alternative institutions.
- Member preferences and internal balancing: Rieck emphasises that India (along with Brazil) is cautious about expansion and about allowing BRICS to follow an overtly China‑led trajectory. This caution stems from India’s strategic culture of non‑alignment and hedging, and from realpolitik concerns about Chinese influence.
- BRICS posture and multipolarity: According to Rieck, BRICS projects multipolarity and non‑alignment rather than an explicitly anti‑Western alliance. That distinction matters: multipolarity can be compatible with selective cooperation with Western states.
- Financial architecture: Rieck notes BRICS’ efforts to build parallel financial institutions and mechanisms; he counsels the West against reflexive opposition, arguing that confrontational responses would be counterproductive and could push partners further into BRICS’ orbit.
- Europe’s stance: Rieck’s recommendation for Europe is restraint and strategic calibration — monitor and respond without overreacting.

3. Alicia García‑Herrero: the rise of anti‑West sentiment and the need to compete economically
- Warning: García‑Herrero highlights a growing anti‑Western current within parts of BRICS and its wider outreach. She warns Western policymakers that dismissing this sentiment would be perilous.
- Prescription: Her policy prescription is unequivocal — the West must offer the Global South materially better economic deals (trade, finance, investment, development finance) if it hopes to blunt BRICS’ appeal. Rhetoric alone will not suffice.

4. Reinhold Brender: pivot at Kazan and a European “wake‑up call”
- Observation: Brender points to tangible signals of the Global South’s pivot toward BRICS, made visible at events such as the Kazan summit where outreach and expansion momentum were on display.
- Wake‑up call: He argues this pivot should alarm the EU about its declining leverage and the need to rethink engagement strategies.
- Recommendation: Brender urges the EU to “think beyond BRICS” — to create flexible, diverse policy instruments for engaging the Global South outside the BRICS framework.

5. Contextualising the commentaries: institutional and political realities
- BRICS composition and expansion: BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) has increasingly promoted alternatives to Western‑dominated institutions (e.g., New Development Bank, discussions on alternative payment arrangements). Expansion debates expose differing member incentives: China’s expansionism versus India and Brazil’s preference for exclusivity and non‑Western identity.
- New financial architectures: Practical initiatives include the New Development Bank and calls for alternative reserve and payment arrangements. These seek to reduce dependence on Western clearing systems and to offer financing with different conditionalities.
- Multipolarity vs. anti‑Westernism: Multipolarity is not identical to an anti‑Western bloc. Nevertheless, perceptions of ideological antagonism can shape policy reactions and partner choices.
- Kazan summit as signal: Summit diplomacy matters. New members, high‑profile outreach and the presence of Global South delegations constitute important signalling that influences third‑party states’ alignments.
- Differentiated member interests: The internal heterogeneity of BRICS — contrasting India and Brazil’s caution with China’s assertiveness — creates opportunities for external actors seeking to shape outcomes.

6. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Reinforcement of hedging and non‑alignment: India’s preference for a BRICS that is non‑Western but not China‑dominated coheres with its long‑standing strategic culture of calibrated hedging. India seeks autonomy of action, selective partnerships, and institutional pluralism rather than bloc commitments.
- Using internal fissures: India can exploit BRICS’ internal divergences to prevent the group from becoming a monolithic China‑led counter‑order. Diplomatic engagement with other skeptical BRICS members (Brazil, South Africa) and with aspirant members can preserve space for India’s interests.
- Financial architecture challenge: India faces a complex choice. Participation in alternative financial arrangements could diversify its options, but India must weigh governance, transparency, and strategic dependencies. India’s approach will likely be transactional — engage when benefits and safeguards align with national interests.
- Strategic signalling to the Global South: India should continue to offer an attractive development and investment profile to Global South partners — leveraging lines of credit, project‑based cooperation, and soft power — without committing to zero‑sum competition with China.
- Security consequences: Any deepening of China’s economic leverage through BRICS instruments can have downstream security implications (economic coercion, critical infrastructure dependencies). India’s national security calculus must therefore integrate economic diplomacy with resilience measures (diversified supply chains, alternative financing).

7. Policy implications and recommendations (for the EU, India and the West) — synthesised from commentators
- Avoid binary framing: Treat BRICS as neither a purely adversarial bloc nor solely a cooperative forum. A nuanced posture reduces the risk of alienating Global South actors.
- Offer competitive economics: Europe and other Western actors must present tangible, improved economic offers — faster, flexible development finance, targeted investment, and trade initiatives — to counter BRICS’ attraction.
- Do not reflexively block financial initiatives: Instead of outright opposition to BRICS financial mechanisms, consider engagement, standards‑setting, or parallel instruments that promote governance and transparency.
- Monitor internal BRICS dynamics: Exploit fissures (e.g., India’s and Brazil’s reservations about Chinese dominance) through targeted diplomacy and issue‑based partnerships.
- Strategic diversification: The EU should “think beyond BRICS” by developing bilateral, regional and flexible multilateral arrangements tailored to partner needs rather than relying on a single institutional architecture.
- Public diplomacy and narrative: Counter anti‑West narratives by demonstrating concrete development outcomes and rule‑based cooperation; reinforce the benefits of transparent, accountable finance and long‑term partnerships.
- National alignment (e.g., Belgium and similar states): Align national foreign policy with coherent EU strategies; offer credible, deliverable economic instruments and maintain diplomatic presence in priority Global South regions.

8. Concluding assessment: operationalising a calibrated response
- For India: The late‑2024 commentaries validate India’s cautious, interest‑driven BRICS posture. India’s strategic culture — preference for autonomy, institutional plurality and calibrated hedging — equips it to navigate BRICS expansion while protecting core security and developmental interests. India should continue to engage selectively with BRICS initiatives that advance its economic and strategic goals, while strengthening alternative partnerships and resilience measures.
- For the West/EU: The dominant policy lesson is pragmatic competition, not outright containment. Competitive economic offers, institutional engagement where feasible, and a diversified diplomatic toolkit will be more effective than binary confrontation. Monitoring BRICS’ internal dynamics and crafting flexible responses that appeal to the Global South will determine whether Europe retains influence in key regions.

This synthesis underscores a central paradox: BRICS’ rise challenges Western pre‑eminence, yet its internal heterogeneity and the varied preferences of members — especially India — mean that a one‑size‑fits‑all response would be both strategically unsound and diplomatically costly. For policymakers in New Delhi and in Europe, the imperative is clear: preserve autonomy, cultivate competitive offers, and shape outcomes through nuanced, interest‑based engagement rather than ideological polarisation.

### Public Awareness of BRICS in Brazil: Polling Evidence and Strategic Implications

Summary of the evidence
- Two opinion polls conducted in Brazil provide a simple, striking finding: knowledge of what the acronym “BRICS” stands for was vanishingly low among respondents.
  - 2014 poll: n = 1,881; 4% of respondents knew the meaning of “BRICS.”
  - 2019 poll: n = 1,849; 3% of respondents knew the meaning of “BRICS.”
- These polls were conducted in the period when Brazil was actively engaged in high‑level BRICS diplomacy — most notably hosting the BRICS leaders’ summit in Brasília on 13–14 November 2019. Photographic/caption records from that summit note former president Jair Bolsonaro welcoming the five leaders in Brasília.

Interpretation of the data
- The data indicate extremely low public awareness of the acronym in the sampled populations. The decline from 4% to 3% between 2014 and 2019, with similar sample sizes, suggests either persistently low recognition or a modest fall in awareness over the five‑year span.
- The juxtaposition is noteworthy: even while Brazil hosted a major summit attended by heads of state, the general public’s recognition of the grouping’s name did not rise to any meaningful level. This contrast highlights a disconnect between elite diplomatic activity and mass public familiarity.

Context and background (concise)
- BRICS: an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The grouping grew out of the earlier BRIC concept (Brazil, Russia, India, China); South Africa joined in 2010.
- BRICS organizes annual leaders’ summits and has developed institutional instruments, most prominently the New Development Bank (NDB), launched by BRICS members in 2014.
- Brazil’s hosting of the 2019 summit in Brasília was an expression of its role in the grouping and an opportunity for domestic visibility of BRICS activities.

Implications and concerns
- Public‑engagement gap: Low awareness suggests limited domestic visibility of BRICS’ purpose and activities. When a multilateral forum is unfamiliar to the public, governments may face constraints in mobilizing domestic political support for initiatives linked to that forum.
- Policy legitimacy and communication: For member states (including India), the efficacy of BRICS initiatives can be affected if the public does not understand why the grouping matters—this complicates narratives linking multilateral engagement to national economic or security interests.
- Interpretation caution: The polling data alone do not explain why awareness is low. Factors such as media coverage, education, the framing of poll questions, and regional variability within Brazil could account for the result.

Methodological caveats to bear in mind
- Survey design matters: Question wording (open‑ended “What does BRICS stand for?” versus multiple‑choice recognition) can produce large differences in measured awareness. The reported percentages are not interpretable without knowing the exact wording.
- Sampling and representativeness: It is essential to confirm whether the polls were nationally representative and how margins of error, weighting, and fieldwork methods were handled.
- Temporal and media effects: The timing of fieldwork relative to summit publicity, and the intensity of media coverage, will influence measured awareness.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Domestic narrative: India’s strategic community should note that being a member of an important multilateral group does not guarantee domestic public understanding or support. This has implications for how Indian policymakers justify multilateral commitments to domestic audiences.
- Soft power and public diplomacy: Low public awareness in partner countries means Indian public diplomacy aimed at sustaining or deepening BRICS cooperation may need to target foreign publics more deliberately—especially where elite diplomacy is not translating into popular recognition.
- Operational risk: If domestic constituencies are uninformed about the aims or benefits of BRICS initiatives (for example, NDB projects), political backlash or scepticism may emerge when costs or visible trade‑offs are presented domestically.

Suggested follow‑up research and policy actions
- Verify poll details: Obtain full questionnaires, sampling frames, margins of error, fieldwork dates, and whether the polls covered Brazil nationwide or specific regions.
- Disaggregate the data: Acquire demographic breakdowns (age, education, region, urban/rural, media consumption) to identify which subgroups have higher or lower awareness.
- Comparative analysis: Compare public awareness of BRICS in Brazil with awareness levels in the other BRICS countries (especially India) and with public familiarity with other international organizations (e.g., G20, OAS, EU).
- Media‑impact study: Assess whether media coverage tied to the 2019 Brasília summit produced any short‑term spikes in recognition, and whether follow‑up public‑engagement efforts (if any) had lasting effects.
- Longitudinal tracking: Examine post‑2019 data to determine whether awareness changed after subsequent summits, NDB project roll‑outs, or intensified public diplomacy.
- Policy response: For practitioners in India and other member states, design public diplomacy strategies that translate elite diplomacy into public narratives—using concrete examples (infrastructure projects, educational exchanges, regional benefits) to make BRICS relevant to ordinary citizens.

Concluding observation
The Brazilian polling snapshot is a useful reminder that multilateral relevance in foreign‑policy circles does not automatically equate to public salience. For India—whose strategic culture places value on both international status and domestic legitimacy—understanding and addressing this elite–public disconnect is important for sustaining credible, resilient multilateral engagements such as BRICS.

## BRICS and the Limits of a Unified Anti‑Western Bloc: Strategic Implications for India

Source: Alissa Wang, Co‑chair, Summit Studies, BRICS Research Group, University of Toronto — presentation, July 2023.

Summary claim
- Wang’s central thesis is that it is unlikely BRICS will evolve into an explicitly anti‑Western geopolitical bloc. This judgment rests on the political heterogeneity of current and prospective members and the institutional dynamics that follow from that diversity.

1. Membership diversity and its consequences
- The BRICS constellation mixes regime types and foreign‑policy orientations: established democracies (India, Brazil, South Africa) sit alongside authoritarian states (China, Russia). Those differences matter.
  - Democracies bring domestic constituencies, electoral politics and often a predisposition toward engagement with Western states and multilateral institutions. Their foreign policies are constrained by domestic opinion and institutional checks.
  - Authoritarian members have stronger incentives and fewer domestic constraints to pursue confrontational or alternative global arrangements, but they cannot unilaterally define BRICS’ direction.
- For India, this heterogeneity reinforces a core feature of its strategic culture: strategic autonomy. India’s tradition of non‑alignment/strategic independence makes it unlikely to accept a BRICS line that would force binary choices between West and non‑West.

2. Political heterogeneity reduces the likelihood of unified anti‑Western action
- Heterogeneous memberships raise transaction costs for consensus: differing threat perceptions, regional priorities, and bilateral ties mean that even if a subset of members favour anti‑Western rhetoric, others will resist institutionalizing it.
- Practical coordination on politically sensitive actions (sanctions‑busting, coordinated diplomatic isolation, collective security postures) requires high levels of trust and convergent interests that BRICS lacks in the near term.
- India’s bilateral ties with the United States and European partners — combined with its own regional priorities (neighbourhood stability, connectivity, economic modernization) — limit the political space for embracing a bloc‑level anti‑Western stance.

3. Expansion: material weight versus political cohesion
- Expansion can increase BRICS’ aggregate economic power (larger markets, resources, alternative markets and financing), enhancing the group’s material relevance in global economics and finance.
- Yet expansion also tends to dilute political cohesion. New members bring new priorities, regional rivalries, and different regime types, which multiplies the difficulties of collective political action.
- For India, expansion presents a mixed calculus: a larger BRICS could unlock development finance and trade partnerships useful for domestic objectives, but it may also increase the influence of actors whose strategic aims conflict with Indian interests.

4. Institution‑building as incremental influence
- BRICS’ institutional outputs — the New Development Bank (NDB), contingency reserve arrangements, and periodic discussion of currency alternatives — can incrementally alter global governance without necessarily producing a cohesive geopolitical bloc.
- Such institutions allow members, including India, to pursue pragmatic economic objectives (infrastructure finance, development partnerships) while avoiding formal military or diplomatic alignment against the West.
- India can thus use BRICS institutions instrumentally: to diversify sources of finance, to shape rules of South–South cooperation, and to advance developmental goals without compromising strategic autonomy.

5. Bilateral coordination among some members remains a strategic risk
- While BRICS as a whole may not become anti‑Western, bilateral or minilateral alignments (notably China–Russia) can pursue coordinated policies that challenge Western interests.
- These bilateral partnerships can generate concrete strategic challenges — intelligence sharing, coordinated diplomatic moves, or trade/financial mechanisms designed to insulate partners from Western pressure — even if they do not mobilize the entire BRICS membership.
- India must therefore assess both multilateral BRICS dynamics and more consequential bilateral combinations among major powers within and outside BRICS.

6. Relevant empirical illustrations
- India routinely balances relations with the United States and with Russia/China, exemplifying why BRICS unanimity is difficult.
- Brazil and South Africa have histories of strategic autonomy and selective engagement with Western and non‑Western partners.
- Russia and China are the most consequential actors pushing an anti‑Western narrative, but their success depends on persuading or coercing other BRICS members to align — an uncertain prospect.
- The NDB and related economic initiatives show how BRICS seeks to expand influence through institutional means rather than a unified geopolitical posture.

7. Caveats and limits of the assessment
- Wang’s assessment (July 2023) is probabilistic, not deterministic. Geopolitics can shift rapidly: crises, regime change, major economic shocks, or dramatic expansion choices could alter alignments.
- The political orientation of incoming members in any future expansion round is a key variable that could reshape consensus capabilities within BRICS.
- Observers should avoid either complacency (assuming BRICS is harmless) or alarmism (assuming a monolithic anti‑Western bloc).

8. Policy implications for India (and relevant notes for Western states, including Canada)
- Treat BRICS as a heterogeneous and instrumentally useful platform rather than as a unitary geopolitical adversary.
  - India should continue using BRICS institutions pragmatically to advance development and finance objectives while preserving strategic independence.
- Monitor and engage bilaterally:
  - Track the policies of individual BRICS members; bilateral economic engagement and security relationships will remain primary determinants of India’s external environment.
- Watch institutional outputs, not just rhetoric:
  - Monitor NDB lending patterns, currency and payments initiatives, and trade/financial arrangements that could erode Western financial dominance or create alternative systems.
- Prepare for asymmetric challenges:
  - Even if BRICS is not cohesive, India must hedge against concerted bilateral moves (e.g., deeper China–Russia coordination) that might affect defence, technology, or financial domains.
- For Western states (including Canada): do not assume BRICS will form a unified counterweight. Instead, engage pragmatically with individual members, strengthen alliances and multilateral institutions that sustain rules‑based order, and monitor BRICS expansion choices for shifts in cohesion and capability.

9. Research and policy priorities
- Empirical tracking of expansion dynamics: candidate profiles, domestic politics of aspirant members, and voting/coordination patterns in multilateral fora.
- Close study of BRICS institutional outputs: NDB project portfolios, conditionality, currency initiatives and payments arrangements; assess whether these produce durable alternatives to existing global governance.
- Analyses of minilateral alignments: map bilateral links among major powers (China–Russia, China–Pakistan, Russia–India etc.) and their operational implications for security and economic policy.
- Scenario work for India’s national security planning: contingency planning for shifts in BRICS cohesion, for possible sanctions‑busting mechanisms, and for market/finance disruptions originating in BRICS initiatives.

Conclusion
- BRICS’ political diversity and the practical limits of consensus make the emergence of an explicitly anti‑Western bloc unlikely in the near term. For India, this reality reinforces longstanding elements of its strategic culture — strategic autonomy, bilateral balancing, and selective multilateralism. Nevertheless, India must remain vigilant: institution‑building within BRICS can shift material balances incrementally, and bilateral partnerships among major non‑Western powers can produce concrete strategic challenges even without full BRICS unanimity. Policy and research should therefore combine close monitoring of individual member behaviour, careful engagement with BRICS institutions for development objectives, and contingency planning for possible shifts in the bloc’s composition and cohesion.

### BRICS in Chinese Elite Discourse: From Development Ally to Architect of a “Post‑Western” Order

Context and primary statements
- In 2012 Hu Jintao — then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and President of the People’s Republic of China — portrayed BRICS as defenders and promoters of developing countries and as a force for world peace. That framing cast BRICS in normative, stabilizing terms: an advocate for development and international tranquillity rather than an adversarial bloc.
- In March 2025 the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS), a government‑affiliated Chinese think tank, articulated a complementary but more structurally ambitious line: BRICS is “not anti‑Western” but is a non‑Western entity seeking a “just and reasonable post‑Western order.” This reformulates BRICS’ purpose in terms of system‑level change rather than purely value‑based advocacy.

Meaning and shift in emphasis
- Hu’s 2012 line emphasized BRICS as representative of Global South interests — a normative champion of development and peace intended to signal inclusivity and non‑confrontation. The emphasis was on moral and functional representation rather than institutional restructuring.
- The SIIS 2025 formulation preserves the non‑Western, developmentist identity but shifts the emphasis toward a structural project: diversification or partial revision of the rules, institutions and practices that have constituted Western predominance. The phrase “post‑Western order” signals an aspiration for a more plural, multipolar governance architecture with different centers of influence.

Significance of SIIS’s provenance
- SIIS is government‑affiliated; while not a formal organ of state policy, its analyses and public messaging frequently reflect elite Chinese discourse and strategic messaging. Statements from such think tanks are therefore best read as indicative of how Beijing wishes to frame an initiative publicly and as a possible window into policy preferences that may be operationalized through diplomatic and institutional practice.
- This provenance creates both signal value (intended audience: domestic and international) and analytic caution: the statement signals intent and framing but is not a formal legal commitment; corroboration through actions is necessary.

Continuity and evolution
- There is clear continuity: both 2012 and 2025 framings present BRICS as a champion of developing countries and as an alternative to exclusive Western leadership.
- The evolution is from value‑and‑identity language (development, peace, representation) toward a clearer structural ambition (a “post‑Western” order). In short: same constituency, more explicit institutional and normative aims.

Strategic messaging and its purposes
- Asserting “not anti‑Western” while advocating a post‑Western order performs two strategic functions:
  - It reduces the appearance of overt confrontation and lowers the incentive for coordinated containment by Western powers.
  - It broadens appeal to states that desire change in international governance but do not want to be locked into adversarial geopolitics — an important recruitment tactic for BRICS expansion and outreach.
- The rhetoric thus seeks legitimacy and coalitional breadth while preserving the option to pursue substantive institutional change incrementally.

Implications for the international order
- “Post‑Western order” implies policy pressure on several dimensions of the current system:
  - Institutional reform: demands for greater voice and voting share in Bretton Woods institutions and other multilateral fora.
  - Normative plurality: promotion of alternative norms and decision‑making practices that better reflect non‑Western preferences.
  - Financial architecture: attempts to diversify payment systems and reduce reliance on the dollar (de‑dollarization), and to expand the role and instruments of vehicles like the New Development Bank (NDB) and China‑led financial arrangements.
  - Trade and rule‑making: initiatives to create parallel or complementary rule sets where existing Western‑led regimes are viewed as exclusionary.
- These are likely to be incremental, pragmatic moves rather than abrupt displacements; the goal is normalization of plurality rather than immediate overthrow of existing institutions.

Domestic political logic in China
- Framing BRICS in peaceful, pro‑development terms is congruent with CCP narratives that legitimize an expansive international role while avoiding rhetoric that directly invites containment or backlash.
- The narrative serves dual domestic purposes: it projects China as a responsible leader of the Global South and sustains a domestic storyline of rising influence achieved through “orderly” reform rather than aggressive confrontation.

Analytic caution: rhetoric versus action
- Think‑tank language is suggestive but not dispositive. Analysts should triangulate rhetoric with observable indicators:
  - BRICS membership expansion and the terms of accession.
  - Institutional deepening: new standing bodies, regularized procedures, increased budgets and staff.
  - Concrete financial instruments: NDB capitalization increases, BRICS currency swap lines, payment system linkages, or concerted use of local currencies.
  - Joint communiqués that contain progressively detailed proposals for governance reform.
  - Bilateral and multilateral agreements among members that operationalize alternatives to Western structures.

Watchpoints and likely near‑term trajectories
- Expect continued emphasis on multipolarity in public statements and diplomacy.
- Incremental institution‑building focused on finance and development (e.g., NDB, contingency financing mechanisms).
- Outreach campaigns to other developing states and regional blocs to enlarge the BRICS constituency and legitimize its proposals.
- Practical normalization of alternatives to Western‑dominated rules rather than immediate displacement: parallel mechanisms, co‑optation, and selective engagement.
- Indicators to monitor closely: NDB capital increases; new BRICS financial instruments; frequency and legal scope of BRICS communiqués; coordinated voting or candidacies in UN and other bodies; and de‑dollarization steps in trade and bilateral finance.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India participates in BRICS with a longstanding preference for strategic autonomy and issue‑specific cooperation. The reframing of BRICS toward a “post‑Western” order has mixed implications for New Delhi:
  - Opportunity: BRICS provides India a multilateral platform to push for global governance reforms that reflect developing country priorities (e.g., IMF/World Bank governance reform, infrastructure financing, development cooperation) without obligating India to take an anti‑Western stance.
  - Risk/constraint: if BRICS activism becomes a vehicle for systemic competition (e.g., coordinated de‑dollarization or alignment that constrains India’s strategic partnerships with Western powers), New Delhi will weigh the platform’s utility against the costs to its broader strategic relationships.
- Practically, India will likely:
  - Continue to extract tangible benefits (project financing, trade opportunities, diplomatic support for governance reforms).
  - Remain cautious about any BRICS initiatives that undercut its strategic autonomy or limit its ability to cooperate with Western partners.
  - Monitor concrete institutional and financial moves (NDB governance, currency arrangements, joint strategic statements) and calibrate its engagement accordingly.

Takeaway
- The 2012 and 2025 statements together reveal a consistent Chinese‑linked narrative: BRICS is a legitimate, development‑oriented actor advocating a fairer and more plural global order. The rhetorical shift toward “post‑Western” language signals a clearer systemic ambition but does not, by itself, imply immediate revolutionary change.
- For analysts and Indian policymakers, the correct posture is pragmatic vigilance: treat think‑tank rhetoric as a directional signal, verify intent through institutional and economic actions, and use BRICS as a platform for advancing India’s development and governance reform priorities while protecting strategic autonomy and existing partnerships.

### France

Background and episode
- In August 2023 French President Emmanuel Macron sought to attend the BRICS summit in Johannesburg. Had he succeeded, Macron would have been the first Western head of government to participate in a BRICS leaders’ meeting. The summit itself was notable for the bloc’s decision to expand—inviting, among others, Argentina, Egypt, Iran, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia and the UAE—an indication of BRICS’ widening global reach and its aspiration to represent a broader Global South constituency.

Macron’s motives and the calculus of outreach
- Macron’s initiative has to be read as deliberate outreach to the Global South. For France and, by extension, the EU, engagement with BRICS economies serves multiple aims: safeguarding trade and investment links, preserving cultural and diplomatic ties (especially in Africa and the Indian Ocean), and positioning France as a potential interlocutor between Western institutions and non‑Western groupings. For Macron, attendance would have been a high‑visibility signal of France’s willingness to engage constructively with a multipolar world rather than treat BRICS purely as a rival.

Russia’s reaction and the multipolar posture of BRICS
- Moscow’s Foreign Ministry publicly rejected Macron’s bid as “unsuitable,” arguing that Western participation would not further BRICS’ goals of advancing developing countries’ interests in a multipolar order. That response is consistent with a strain of thinking among several BRICS members: the bloc functions as a platform for South–South cooperation and as a corrective to Western‑dominated multilateral institutions. Russia’s stance also reflected heightened post‑2022 tensions between Russia and Western capitals; suspicion of Western presence in forums promoting strategic autonomy was therefore politically salient.

Practical implications and tensions
- The episode illuminates competing logics. On one hand, Western attendance could open channels for problem‑solving, economic opportunity and diplomatic bridge‑building. On the other hand, it risks diluting BRICS’ identity as a space for non‑Western states to coordinate and press for governance reform. For BRICS cohesion, excluding Western leaders preserves a clear symbolic boundary that reinforces the bloc’s self‑definition and strategic autonomy. For France, the attempt signaled active engagement with emerging powers but carried the risk of political backlash from members who view Western involvement as undermining the bloc’s purpose.

BRICS objectives in view of the episode
- BRICS has articulated ambitions to reshape aspects of international financial and governance architecture—seeking greater voice in institutions such as the IMF and World Bank, and building alternatives like the New Development Bank. Western leader participation could be perceived as compromising those objectives by re‑introducing the very actors and paradigms BRICS seeks to diversify away from. Historically, BRICS summits have emphasized South–South cooperation; Western attendance would thus have been unprecedented and symbolically loaded, explaining the vigorous public pushback.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s posture toward this episode is instructive for understanding its strategic culture. As a BRICS member that also values deep ties with Western democracies, India routinely balances competing relationships rather than aligning narrowly. New Delhi’s likely approach to Macron’s initiative would have been cautious: appreciating potential benefits of France–BRICS dialogue (trade, technology, climate cooperation), while mindful of preserving BRICS’ cohesion and India’s own strategic autonomy. For India’s national security policy, the incident underscores the importance of multilateral forums as instruments of hedging—platforms where diplomatic flexibility and signalling matter as much as formal alignments.

Policy implications
- For France/EU: engaging BRICS can yield dividends, but such outreach must be calibrated to avoid the perception of co‑optation; soft diplomacy, bilateral tracks with key members, and targeted multilateral initiatives may be more effective than high‑profile summit attendance.
- For BRICS cohesion: maintaining a clear non‑Western identity can strengthen internal solidarity, but too rigid an exclusivity risks isolating the bloc from constructive engagement with advanced economies.
- For the global order: the episode highlights an ongoing contest over who sits at influential tables and how multipolarity is institutionalized. It underlines that symbolic access is as consequential as formal policy, particularly in nascent or identity‑oriented groupings.

Key takeaway
- Macron’s bid to attend the 2023 BRICS summit was a notable gesture of outreach to the Global South that met firm resistance from Russia. The episode exemplifies BRICS’ self‑definition as a developing‑world, multipolar forum and exposes the geopolitical sensitivities that accompany any Western presence in spaces designed to offer alternatives to Western‑dominated governance. For India, the incident reinforced the utility of calibrated multilateral engagement and the centrality of strategic autonomy in its foreign and security policy.

### 6.x German Policy Foundations on BRICS: Continuities from 2013 to the 2023 Expansion and Implications for Europe and India

Introduction  
European perceptions of BRICS have evolved in the last decade from academic curiosity to strategic concern. Two German political foundations—Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES) and Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF)—offer representative glimpses of how German domestic debate has framed BRICS’ growing international agency. Reading these interventions together (a 2013 FES assessment and policy reactions after the 2023 BRICS enlargement, including public commentary by MEP Reinhard Bütikofer) reveals both continuity in German analytical attention and divergence in recommended policy responses. This section distils those assessments, draws out strategic and operational implications for Germany and the EU, and highlights what India’s strategic community should monitor and expect from European behaviour toward BRICS.

FES 2013: an early diagnostic of rising agency  
- The FES note of September 2013 foregrounded a new pattern: BRICS states (implicitly China, India, Brazil, South Africa, and—with notable difference—Russia) were, for the first time, acting with greater agency on the international stage.  
- FES singled out Russia as an exception to the emergent coordinated diplomacy among BRICS members. The “exception” can be read two ways: either Russia already occupied a distinctive international role that set it apart from other BRICS partners, or its behaviour diverged from an otherwise increasing pattern of coordinated, multipolar engagement.  
- Analytically, the FES assessment is important because it records German centre-left attention to non-Western agency early in the BRICS trajectory—an observation that would reappear in later debates.

Responses to the 2023 BRICS expansion: signalling and strategic prudence  
- Reinhard Bütikofer (Green MEP and long-standing EU observer of global affairs) publicly warned that developing countries “may turn to BRICS if Europe fails to prove its reliability and credibility as a fair partner.” His statement is political signalling aimed at domestic and EU audiences: it frames European policy urgency and stresses conditionality in partner choices—states in the Global South will pivot based on perceived European credibility.  
- The FNF (liberal foundation linked to the Free Democratic Party) described the BRICS enlargement as a “wake-up call” for Europe and Germany. The FNF counselled caution: formal European outreach need not precede an explicit articulation of BRICS’ collective goals. In short, monitor first; engage later—once aims and institutional trajectories are clear.  
- FNF also recommended a selective-engagement strategy: identify and integrate “Western-oriented BRICS countries” into global governance architectures where possible, thereby preserving and extending liberal norms through targeted cooperation.

Domestic politics and source positioning  
- The two foundations’ positions reflect distinct ideological lenses within German policy debate. FES (SPD-affiliated) emphasises geopolitical agency and the potential systemic challenge posed by emerging powers; FNF (FDP-affiliated) stresses principled, cautious engagement and opportunity-cost calculations. These domestic perspectives shape German—and by extension EU—interpretations of BRICS dynamics and inform the policy options put forward to EU institutions.

Implications for Germany and the EU: strategic choices and stakes  
- Loss of influence risk: if Europe appears unreliable, partner states in the Global South may deepen ties with BRICS-led initiatives (finance, payments, development), reducing EU leverage.  
- Selective engagement as hedging: partnering with BRICS members that are amenable to liberal governance norms could preserve influence without legitimising revisionist institutional alternatives.  
- Institutional competition risk: BRICS-driven alternatives (new development banks, payment systems, regulatory standards) pose a material challenge to EU normative and economic influence if unchecked.

Operational considerations and policy recommendations  
- Monitoring: establish continuous, analytic monitoring of BRICS communiqués, membership changes, and institutional moves (new banks, clearing houses, standards bodies). Avoid reactive policymaking; prioritise intelligence on BRICS cohesion and agendas.  
- Targeted outreach: prepare contingency engagement plans for “Western-oriented” BRICS actors—offer concrete partnership packages in development finance, market access, and regulatory cooperation.  
- Credibility-building: strengthen Europe’s offer to the Global South through predictable development financing, streamlined trade partnerships, and diplomatic responsiveness. Credibility is both policy substance and reputational performance.  
- Scenario planning: craft three operational scenarios to guide response—(1) constructive dialogue if BRICS adopts moderate, governance-focused objectives; (2) compartmentalised engagement where cooperation can be isolated to specific issues; (3) containment or counter-institutional strategies if BRICS promotes overtly anti-Western institutional architectures.  
- Multilateral coordination: use UN, G20, WTO forums and coordinate with like-minded partners (Japan, Canada, Australia) to present a unified, attractive alternative to states considering BRICS alignment.

Risks to watch and short-term priorities  
- Fragmentation of global governance through competing institutions that erode common standards and reduce EU leverage.  
- Rapid operationalisation of BRICS institutions (finance, payments, standards) that create path dependencies for partner states.  
- Potential cleavages within BRICS between authoritarian-aligned members and those more disposed to liberal norms—these cleavages are opportunities for selective engagement.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and policy choices  
- India sits at the intersection of these dynamics: an influential BRICS member whose own strategic culture emphasises strategic autonomy and diversified partnerships. European behaviour—whether driven by credibility-building or withdrawal—will shape India’s calculation about deepening ties with the EU versus expanding cooperation within BRICS-led frameworks.  
- For Indian policy-makers: European fragmentation or selective engagement presents both opportunity and risk. India can exploit gaps in development finance and standards-setting to advance its own agenda, but must also weigh the benefits of partnering with the EU on governance norms and high-value technology, which align with long-term capacity-building.  
- India’s strategic culture of hedging and non-alignment suggests pragmatic engagement with both the EU and BRICS, but effective outcomes will depend on credible offers from Europe and the EU’s readiness to treat India as a strategic partner rather than a transactional counterparty.

Conclusion: an agenda for attention  
European responses to the 2023 BRICS expansion should be read as both a reflection of domestic political lenses and as strategic choices with tangible consequences. Germany and the EU face a clear imperative: preserve and demonstrate credibility to the Global South, monitor BRICS trajectories closely, and retain policy flexibility to engage selectively with those BRICS members who can be integrated into liberal global governance. For India, these European choices will influence New Delhi’s own balancing act between regional diversification, institutional reform, and strategic autonomy. The next phase of BRICS institutional development—membership composition, bank and payments architecture, and public communiqués—must therefore be treated as priority input into European and Indian policy-making alike.

### Chapter X — India and BRICS: Engagement, Caution, and the Strategic Use of a Plural Forum (through mid‑2025)

This section analyses India’s evolving relationship with BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and later participants), situating Indian policy statements and actions within its broader strategic culture and national security policy. It covers competing assessments of BRICS’s purpose and limits; key bilateral incidents that tested the grouping’s utility; institutional instruments and economic initiatives; India’s posture and priorities as a cautious, agenda‑setting member; and the implications for India’s strategic autonomy. The narrative and analysis extend through the Rio summit (7 July 2025) and India’s preparations for its 2026 presidency.

1. BRICS in Indian debate: competing narratives
- Critics and sceptics: Voices such as Vijay Prashad (2014) argue that BRICS has largely embraced neoliberal policy prescriptions and lacks a coherent alternative ideology or institutional architecture capable of displacing Western primacy. Brahma Chellaney (2016) likewise questioned the group’s ability to create durable institutionalized cooperation, even while calling BRICS the first significant non‑Western global initiative after the Cold War.
- Government framing: Indian leaders have offered a different interpretive frame. Narendra Modi (2014) emphasized that reform of global governance institutions “has been on the BRICS agenda since its inception,” positioning the grouping as a platform for modernization rather than confrontation. Later, at Kazan (2024) and again publicly, Modi cautioned that BRICS should not be perceived as seeking to replace existing institutions — a reassurance aimed at both Western audiences and domestic stakeholders.
- Pragmatic balance: Indian officials and commentators (e.g., Meera Shankar; RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das) characterise India’s BRICS engagement as pragmatic: a vehicle to amplify Global South voices and pursue selective institutional innovations (finance, payments) without adopting an ideologically anti‑Western posture.

2. Summit diplomacy and bilateral crises: what BRICS can — and cannot — do
- Bilateral disputes remain primarily bilateral. The Galwan clash (2020) between India and China and the Doklam standoff (2017) illustrate how India treats territorial and security disputes with China as essentially bilateral problems. BRICS has not become a collective security forum capable of resolving such conflicts.
- Yet summit diplomacy can serve as a “forcing event.” The 2017 Xiamen summit occurred only after India’s threat to skip the meeting during the Doklam crisis; that diplomatic leverage contributed to de‑escalation and attendance. Similarly, at the 2023 summit China and India agreed to try to address border issues, but subsequent Chinese cartographic claims underscored persistent trust deficits.
- Practical implication: BRICS functions as a high‑level diplomatic channel that can help manage, but not eliminate, bilateral tensions. Its utility lies in face‑to‑face summit politics rather than institutionalized security cooperation.

3. Institutional instruments, economics, and the limits of dedollarization
- Existing BRICS instruments: The New Development Bank (NDB) and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) are tangible institutional outputs. However, their scale and global reach remain limited relative to Bretton Woods institutions.
- Payments, invoicing, and “dedollarization”: Periodic proposals for alternate payment systems or a BRICS currency resurface. Indian officials (e.g., Meera Shankar) stress that pilot payment arrangements are exploratory and unlikely to displace the U.S. dollar in the medium term. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das (Dec 2024) framed India’s shift as “derisking” trade exposure rather than ideologically driven dedollarization.
- Practical obstacles to an alternate currency: Deep liquidity, network externalities, reserve currency status, invoicing conventions, divergent macro regimes, capital controls, and geographic dispersion make a single BRICS currency or rapid dedollarization impractical. By contrast, regional currency projects (e.g., the euro) benefited from geographic proximity and macroeconomic convergence — conditions largely absent in BRICS.
- Operational versus rhetorical change: Much BRICS rhetoric on reform and monetary alternatives remains aspirational. Actual operational change (lending volumes, reserve usage, payment system adoption) is incremental and technical, not revolutionary.

4. India’s strategic positioning within BRICS: hedging, agenda‑setting, and guarding against capture
- Strategic autonomy and hedging: India uses BRICS to expand diplomatic space without binding alliance commitments. Participation offers an avenue for Global South advocacy while avoiding full alignment with any bloc — a classic hedging posture within Indian strategic culture.
- Agenda‑setting opportunity: India’s presidency in 2026 offers a concrete chance to shape BRICS priorities toward resilient, people‑centric development. At the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio (7 July 2025), Prime Minister Narendra Modi signalled this direction by proposing a rearticulated acronym — “Building Resilience and Innovation for Cooperation and Sustainability” — and by foregrounding pandemics, climate change, and human‑centred cooperation.
- Managing China and internal coalition dynamics: India seeks to cooperate where possible with China inside BRICS while preventing Chinese dominance of the grouping. Senior diplomats (e.g., D. Bala Venkatesh Varma) have pushed back against narratives of Chinese hegemony within BRICS, and policymakers (Ashok Malik) warned against the group acquiring a “distortionary ideological edge.” Expansion of membership raises the risk of dilution or capture; India’s responses emphasize pragmatic coalitions with like‑minded members to protect its interests.

5. BRICS in the multiplex governance landscape: coexistence with G7 and G20
- Complementary fora: Indian policymakers, including S. Jaishankar (2024), have framed BRICS not as a zero‑sum replacement for G7 or G20 but as a parallel platform reflecting different constituencies and priorities. India’s participation thus situates it across multiple forums, amplifying its diplomatic reach while managing perceptions in the West.
- Political signaling: India’s consistent message — that BRICS is “non‑Western” rather than “anti‑Western” — is intended to preserve strategic flexibility and reassure Western partners while mobilizing Global South reformist claims (UNSC, WTO representation).

6. Key implications for India’s national security and strategic culture
- Strategic autonomy reaffirmed: Engagement with BRICS is congruent with India’s post‑Cold War emphasis on non‑alignment/strategic autonomy — leveraging multilateral platforms to diversify partnerships and reduce dependence on any single power.
- Policy pragmatism: India’s approach to dedollarization, payments innovation, and institutional reform is cautious and incremental — reflecting a risk‑management mindset rather than ideological zeal.
- Diplomatic utility and limits: BRICS is a useful diplomatic tool for agenda‑setting, summit‑level influence, and South‑South cooperation, but it is a poor substitute for formal security arrangements or immediate resolution of bilateral territorial tensions.
- Domestic‑international linkages: India’s domestic reform agenda and political economy shape its BRICS posture — technocratic proposals (resilience, innovation, sustainability) dovetail with domestic priorities and enhance India’s leadership credibility in the Global South.

7. Quotations, their context, and interpretive significance
- “Reform of institutions of global governance ... has been on the BRICS agenda since its inception.” — India’s framing that BRICS seeks modernization of global institutions rather than antagonism.
- “Because you won’t let us into the G7 club.” — Jaishankar’s remark encapsulates BRICS as an alternative avenue for rising powers excluded from Western clubs.
- “We must be careful to ensure that this organization does not acquire the image of one that is trying to replace global institutions.” — Modi’s caution aims to reduce fears of ideological competition and to keep BRICS attractive to a wide membership.
- “Dedollarization for India was only a part of ‘derisking’.” — Reflects India’s technocratic, risk‑management approach to currency strategy rather than ideological opposition to the dollar.

8. Recommended focal points for further analysis (through India’s 2026 presidency)
- Measure operational progress: Track NDB lending volumes, CRA activations, and concrete outputs from BRICS payment pilots through 2026.
- Study expansion effects: Assess how additions to BRICS membership affect cohesion, agenda coherence, and power dynamics.
- Examine India‑China trust mechanisms: Evaluate how summit diplomacy translates into bilateral confidence‑building measures and whether BRICS can institutionalize any such mechanisms.
- Model payment alternatives: Analyze feasibility, macroeconomic impacts, and transition paths for alternate invoicing and payment arrangements with India’s major trading partners.
- Operationalize India’s 2026 agenda: Map funding needs, institutional designs, and likely coalition partners for India’s proposed resilience‑and‑innovation priorities.

Conclusion
India’s relationship with BRICS up to mid‑2025 illustrates a careful equilibrium: the country seeks to exploit BRICS as a platform for Global South advocacy, developmental cooperation, and summit diplomacy while guarding against ideological capture, rapid dedollarization, or subordination to any single member’s strategic designs. BRICS’s heterogeneity and limited institutional depth mean its greatest value to India lies in agenda‑setting and diplomatic leverage rather than in replacing established security or financial architectures. As India prepares to assume the BRICS presidency in 2026, it faces the dual task of operationalizing a technocratic, people‑centric program and ensuring that expansion and institutional innovation preserve the grouping’s plural, non‑ideological character — consistent with India’s long‑standing strategic culture of calibrated autonomy.

## BRICS — Stance on Terrorism

This section examines how India has used the BRICS forum to shape multilateral discourse on terrorism, the contours of its arguments at recent summits, and the prospects and limits of translating declaratory commitments into operational cooperation. The episode illuminates broader features of India’s strategic culture: a preference for rules-based multilateralism, insistence on non-selectivity in security governance, and sustained diplomacy to internationalize domestic security concerns.

### India’s interventions at recent BRICS summits
At the 16th and 17th BRICS Summits, Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressed BRICS partners to adopt a firmer, more consistent posture against terrorism and terrorist financing. His interventions combined normative claims with concrete policy prescriptions:

- 16th BRICS Summit: Modi reiterated India’s firm stance against terrorism and urged unified action by BRICS members to combat terrorism and its financing. He warned against “double standards,” called for prevention of youth radicalization, and pushed for early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) at the UN. Implicit in these points was India’s demand for credible and consistent global counter‑terrorism efforts.
- 17th BRICS Summit: In the wake of the Pahalgam attack, Modi strongly condemned the violence, described it as a “direct attack on the soul, identity and dignity of India,” and insisted the international community must “reject double standards.” He declared that “condemning terrorism should be our principle, not just a convenience,” and argued sanctions against terrorists should be applied irrespective of political considerations. Following these appeals, the BRICS declaration of 22 April 2025 explicitly condemned the Pahalgam attack, noted 26 fatalities, and acknowledged India’s concerns.

Three phrases used repeatedly in Indian appeals encapsulate the framing: “double standards,” “condemning terrorism should be our principle, not just a convenience,” and “direct attack on the soul, identity and dignity of India.”

### Political and legal context: CCIT and BRICS decision‑making
Two contextual facts are essential to reading India’s BRICS diplomacy:

- The Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (CCIT) remains a long‑standing UN proposal intended to create a universal legal framework defining and combating terrorism. Adoption has been blocked historically by disputes over the definition of terrorism—particularly whether or how to treat state actions and political motivations.
- BRICS operates largely by consensus. Its members have divergent foreign policy priorities and strategic relationships, which complicates efforts to achieve uniform counter‑terrorism measures. Consensus modes produce strong political statements when achievable, but limit the group’s capacity to impose binding obligations or coercive enforcement mechanisms.

These constraints shape what is feasible for India within BRICS: normative pressure and political internationalization are achievable; legally binding or coercive measures require much longer diplomatic gestation and, often, alignment beyond BRICS.

### The “double standards” critique and its significance
India’s repeated invocation of “double standards” targets selective application of counter‑terrorism labels, sanctions, and condemnations according to political convenience rather than legal criteria. This critique serves multiple purposes:

- Norm‑setting: It frames consistent condemnation and punishment of terrorism as a legal and moral baseline rather than a discretionary political act.
- Diplomacy: It seeks to delegitimize states or coalitions that refuse to act against certain groups for strategic reasons, making such selectivity politically costly.
- Procedural leverage: By tying the CCIT and sanctions policy to the principle of non‑selectivity, India aims to shift debates from episodic condemnations to rules‑based mechanisms.

However, alleging double standards is not by itself sufficient to change behavior. It is a mobilizing rhetorical device that must be accompanied by coalition‑building and evidentiary argumentation to produce policy shifts.

### Focus on youth radicalization and preventive measures
India’s call for combined action to prevent youth radicalization recognizes that counter‑terrorism must include preventive, societal responses in addition to coercive measures. Practical components of prevention that lend themselves to cooperation include:

- Education and civic curricula that promote resilience to extremist narratives.
- Community engagement and socioeconomic programs addressing drivers of radicalization.
- Online counter‑messaging and platform cooperation to remove and counteract extremist content.
- Rehabilitation and deradicalization programs sharing best practices and evaluation metrics.

These areas are primarily domestic policy domains, but they benefit from capacity‑building, technical assistance, and common standards — arenas where BRICS cooperation can produce incremental gains.

### Sanctions, financial measures and enforcement challenges
Modi’s insistence that sanctions be applied “irrespective of political considerations” targets the financial choke‑points that enable terrorist activity. Effective sanctions and counter‑terrorist financing (CTF) measures require:

- Convergent legal frameworks across jurisdictions (for asset freezes, travel bans, prosecution).
- Robust financial intelligence sharing and anti‑money‑laundering controls.
- Political will to designate and target individuals and networks, even when those links implicate actors with strategic ties.

BRICS could coordinate on these modalities (harmonized AML rules, shared FIUs, joint investigative teams), but doing so confronts legal heterogeneity, sovereignty concerns, and geopolitical ties to third parties that may constrain member willingness to act.

### The Pahalgam attack and BRICS’ political response
The explicit mention of the Pahalgam attack in the BRICS declaration (22 April 2025), including acknowledgment of 26 fatalities, illustrates a tactical diplomatic success for India: it internationalized a domestic security incident within a multilateral forum composed of strategic partners and potential interlocutors. The political significance is clear — a consensus condemnation signals collective concern and isolates perpetrators rhetorically — but the operational consequences are limited unless followed by specific cooperative steps (intelligence, sanctions, law enforcement cooperation).

### From rhetoric to practice: plausible BRICS‑level measures
If BRICS sought to translate declaratory commitments into concrete cooperation, practical measures could include:

- Enhanced intelligence‑sharing protocols and secure communication channels for timely exchange on terrorist plots and financiers.
- Coordinated designations and sanctions lists, with joint procedures for evidence review and delisting.
- Joint training programs and capacity‑building for investigative, forensic, and counter‑radicalization work.
- Harmonization of anti‑money‑laundering and counter‑terrorist‑financing (AML/CTF) regulations and improved financial information‑sharing.
- Collaborative online content moderation strategies and joint initiatives to counter violent extremist narratives.

Each measure demands legal harmonization, technical investment, and political trust.

### Structural obstacles and strategic dilemmas
Significant challenges will constrain BRICS’ ability to operationalize a non‑selective counter‑terrorism regime:

- Divergent geopolitical ties: Some BRICS members maintain relationships with states or non‑state actors accused of supporting militants; political calculus may override uniform action.
- Legal and institutional differences: Varying legal standards, evidentiary thresholds, and judicial processes hinder rapid coordination.
- Consensus decision‑making: The need for unanimity limits ambitious or coercive measures and favors broad, politically palatable declarations over binding action.
- Enforcement capacity: Even with consensus, differing domestic enforcement capacities and willingness to act across borders can blunt impact.

These structural features mean that political declarations (like the BRICS condemnation of Pahalgam) are easier to obtain than sustained operational cooperation.

### Strategic recommendations for India
To convert political capital within BRICS into durable cooperation, India should pursue a calibrated strategy:

- Evidence and documentation: Systematically document incidents and financial linkages with clear evidentiary packets suitable for multilateral fora and for partners’ domestic legal processes.
- Targeted diplomacy: Build coalitions within BRICS and with like‑minded external partners to create cross‑regional pressure for non‑selective application of sanctions and designations.
- Offer capacity assistance: Link calls for collective action to concrete capacity‑building offers (training, technical assistance on AML/CTF, digital‑counter‑messaging) to make cooperation mutually beneficial.
- Incrementalism: Prioritize confidence‑building measures (shared exercises, legal‑technical working groups) that can produce practical results without triggering geopolitical resistance.
- Multi‑track engagement: Use BRICS for normative pressure while simultaneously engaging the UN, Financial Action Task Force (FATF)‑related processes, and bilateral channels to institutionalize outcomes.

Sustained diplomacy that couples normative claims with tangible cooperative offers will be more persuasive than rhetorical appeals alone.

### Conclusion
India has used BRICS to press for a rules‑based, consistent global counter‑terrorism posture — urging non‑selectivity, the early adoption of the CCIT at the UN, and specific attention to incidents such as the Pahalgam attack. The BRICS declaration’s explicit condemnation of Pahalgam demonstrates India’s success in internationalizing the episode within that forum. Yet the real test lies in converting political language into enforceable practices: this requires overcoming BRICS’ consensus constraints, divergent strategic ties among members, and legal heterogeneity. Practically significant progress will depend on India’s ability to marshal evidence, build coalitions, offer operational cooperation, and pursue incremental, confidence‑building measures that make non‑selective action politically and legally feasible.

### 5.X Modi at Kazan: “India stands for peace, not war” — Diplomacy, Multilateralism and Strategic Autonomy

Event and focal claim
- At the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated a central element of India's external posture: a principled preference for diplomacy and negotiated settlement in the Russia–Ukraine conflict. His succinct formulation — “India stands for peace, not war” — encapsulated a message directed at a diverse, multilateral audience and explicitly invoked adherence to the United Nations Charter as the legal and normative anchor for that position.

Context: BRICS as the venue
- The choice of BRICS as the platform is significant. BRICS congregates states with divergent policy orientations toward the Russia–Ukraine war, most notably including Russia and China. Public appeals for dialogue within this forum are therefore calibrated: they emphasize common ground (multilateral processes, diplomacy) while avoiding language that would amount to direct criticism of member states such as Russia. The forum’s loose institutional architecture also constrains the kinds of commitments it can credibly make on contentious security disputes.

Strategic signalling and reputation management
- Modi’s remark performs several diplomatic functions simultaneously:
  - It projects India as a responsible, peace-oriented actor committed to international norms, thereby enhancing New Delhi’s global image.
  - It preserves strategic autonomy by avoiding explicit condemnation of Russia — a key bilateral partner across defence and energy domains — while still signalling disapproval of war as an instrument of policy.
  - Invoking the UN Charter serves a dual purpose: it roots India’s claim in widely accepted legal principles (thus reassuring Western interlocutors) and frames India’s stance as principled rather than opportunistic.

Operational gaps: rhetoric versus concrete mechanisms
- The Kazan statement articulates ends (peace, negotiation) but not means. It neither outlines concrete mediation steps nor specifies timelines, institutional mechanisms, or the resources India might deploy to facilitate talks.
- BRICS lacks robust conflict-resolution machinery; therefore, while the forum provides normative cover for calls to negotiate, it is an unlikely vehicle to produce or enforce a negotiated settlement between Moscow and Kyiv given member divergences.

Practical moves to watch
- To move from rhetoric to practice, India could pursue a range of diplomatic measures. Key observable indicators include:
  - Voting behaviour and abstentions in UN General Assembly and Security Council votes related to the conflict.
  - Intensified bilateral diplomacy — discreet shuttle diplomacy with Moscow and Kyiv — and offers to host exploratory talks on neutral soil.
  - Formal mediation proposals or confidence‑building initiatives tabled bilaterally or within multilateral fora (including, where feasible, BRICS-led dialogue tracks).
  - Proposals for technical or humanitarian cooperation (ceasefire monitoring teams, humanitarian corridors) that might create space for political negotiations.

Audience effects: differentiated receptions
- Russia: Emphasis on dialogue is likely to be welcomed by Moscow as it avoids direct public censure and keeps bilateral channels open.
- Western capitals and Kyiv: While the rhetoric of diplomacy and UN adherence will be noted positively, these audiences may judge the statement insufficient unless it is followed by tangible actions (e.g., clearer voting patterns, mediation offers, or concrete pressure on the use of force).
- Global South and nonaligned audiences: The message reinforces India’s long-standing claim to be an independent voice that privileges peaceful dispute settlement, resonant in many developing-country capitals.

Policy continuity and strategic logic
- The statement is coherent with India’s long-standing foreign-policy tropes: commitment to multilateralism, respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity as framed through the UN Charter, and avoidance of bloc-based alignments. Rather than a policy shift, Kazan reaffirms continuity in India’s strategic culture — a mix of normative commitment to multilateral order and pragmatic protection of bilateral interests.

Implications for bilateral relations
- India–Russia: The calibrated language allows New Delhi to maintain its critical defence and energy ties with Russia without overtly jeopardising relations; it is a diplomatic balancing act that seeks to keep channels open for future cooperation and influence.
- India–West: By publicly invoking diplomacy and the UN Charter, India signals to Western partners that it remains committed to core international norms — a reassurance intended to mitigate concerns arising from India’s reluctance to explicitly condemn Russia.

Conclusion: purposeful diplomacy, limited by the lack of follow‑through
- Modi’s Kazan remarks succinctly promote negotiation, multilateral norms, and the UN Charter as the preferred route for resolving the Russia–Ukraine conflict. The statement is purposeful diplomacy aimed at multiple audiences: it projects India as a pro‑peace, multilateral actor while preserving strategic autonomy and existing ties. However, unless the rhetoric is matched by specific diplomatic initiatives (mediation offers, voting patterns, or hosting of talks), the claim remains largely rhetorical. The strategic test for Indian policy will be whether these words are translated into discernible actions that can credibly contribute to conflict de‑escalation.

## Iran's 2023 Admission to BRICS: Strategic Consequences and Implications for India

Overview and official framing
- In 2023 Iran was admitted to BRICS. Iranian authorities framed the admission as a significant diplomatic accomplishment: President Sayyid Ebrahim Raisolsadat publicly hailed it as a “strategic success,” asserting that “the global confidence in the effectiveness of BRICS is increasing.” Foreign Minister Hossein Amir‑Abdollahian reinforced this line, arguing that Iran’s membership would help strengthen BRICS’ multilateralism. These statements serve both external signalling and internal legitimation purposes.

Context: BRICS expansion and purpose
- The 2023 enlargement of BRICS — which brought in several new members alongside Iran — was explicitly presented by the grouping as an effort to broaden its global footprint and to project an alternative platform for non‑Western multilateral cooperation. The admission must be read against BRICS’ twin goals of amplifying Global South influence and demonstrating institutional relevance beyond the Western‑dominated order.

Iran’s political intent in seeking membership
- For Tehran, BRICS membership has clear political utility. After decades of international isolation and sanction pressure, Iran seeks diplomatic rehabilitation and diversified sources of political support. Membership is portrayed domestically as international recognition and as a vindication of Iran’s foreign policy resilience.

Strategic implications for Iran
- Diversifying partnerships: BRICS offers Iran wider state‑level engagements beyond its traditional partners, opening markets and political support networks.
- Alternative finance and trade: Iran can pursue non‑dollar trade arrangements, alternative payment systems, and BRICS‑facilitated investment channels to attenuate the impact of Western financial restrictions.
- Leverage in negotiations: Association with a larger multilateral bloc may provide Iran bargaining leverage in bilateral and multilateral forums.

Implications for BRICS
- Geopolitical weight: Admitting Iran can bolster BRICS’ claim to represent diverse non‑Western interests and increase its geopolitical salience.
- Internal tensions: Members have heterogeneous relations with Iran and with Western states. Accommodating a sanctioned state raises questions about cohesion, risk tolerance, and the bloc’s policy alignment. The enlargement thereby enhances influence but complicates consensus‑based decision‑making.

Sanctions, finance and practical mechanisms
- Iran’s accession foregrounds operational questions about trade and finance: whether BRICS members will operationalize non‑dollar settlement mechanisms, shields against secondary sanctions, or investment vehicles that can reliably channel finance to a sanctioned economy.
- Any practical circumvention requires technical arrangements (payment rails, correspondent banking alternatives, trade invoicing practices) and political willingness among BRICS partners to accept associated risks.

Legitimacy messaging: multilateralism and effectiveness
- Iranian leaders’ rhetoric — stressing growing “confidence” in BRICS and the strengthening of “multilateralism” — serves a dual purpose: to cast BRICS as a credible, rules‑guided counterweight to existing institutions, and to normalise Iran’s role within a multilateral framework. This normative framing is intended to shift perceptions away from pariah status toward accepted multilateral actor.

Potential pushback and reputational risks
- Western governments and human‑rights organisations are likely to register concern. Criticisms will focus on Iran’s nuclear programme, human‑rights record, and the risk that membership could facilitate sanctions circumvention. Such pushback can translate into diplomatic friction and potential secondary consequences for BRICS members engaging economically with Iran.

Domestic political effects in Iran
- Domestically, Iranian leaders can exploit BRICS membership for political gain: portraying it as vindication of foreign policy, as a source of national pride, and as evidence of the regime’s ability to break isolation. This bolsters regime legitimacy and nationalist narratives.

Operational challenges to integration
- Integrating Iran into BRICS cooperation (finance, trade, infrastructure projects, development banks) requires:
  - Trust‑building measures among member states;
  - Legal and institutional adaptations to accommodate a sanctioned member;
  - Practical solutions for payments, investment guarantees, and dispute settlement; and
  - Calibration of cooperation areas to avoid entanglement in sanctions risks.
- These are not merely technical hurdles but also political choices that test BRICS’ coherence.

Broader trend: toward multipolarity
- Iran’s accession exemplifies a larger global trend: states outside the Western order are deepening institutional cooperation to rebalance influence. It signals an intensifying contest over the architecture of global governance and the normative compass of multilateralism.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Strategic trade‑offs: India historically pursues a mix of strategic autonomy, engagement with great powers, and selective alignment with non‑Western multilateralism. Iran’s BRICS membership sharpens trade‑offs between India’s ties with the West and its interests in regional connectivity, energy security, and relations with Iran.
- Economic and connectivity considerations: India has economic stakes in Iran (energy imports, Chabahar port, regional connectivity initiatives). BRICS‑mediated finance or alternative payment arrangements could facilitate trade, but India must weigh benefits against sanctions‑related legal and reputational risks.
- Security and regional balance: India must assess how Iran’s enhanced multilateral standing affects Pakistan‑Iran dynamics, Iran’s relations with China, and wider West Asia security calculations that influence India’s national security environment.
- Policy posture: For New Delhi, prudent options include:
  - Pursuing issue‑based cooperation with BRICS members on economic and development matters while avoiding entanglement in activities that risk contravening sanctions or undermining strategic partnerships;
  - Advocating for BRICS institutional transparency and rule‑based procedures that mitigate reputational risks; and
  - Leveraging India’s diplomatic capital to shape BRICS’ engagement modalities with sanctioned states toward predictable, legalistic frameworks.
- Normative consistency: India’s strategic culture of balancing autonomy with principle calls for articulating clear norms on counter‑terrorism, non‑proliferation, and sanctions compliance while engaging in multipolar institutions.

Concluding assessment
- Iran’s admission to BRICS is simultaneously an opportunity and a complication: it boosts Iran’s access to alternative multilateral mechanisms and increases BRICS’ geopolitical salience, but it also introduces reputational, legal, and cohesion challenges for the bloc and its members. For India, the development requires calibrated diplomacy that protects core security interests, exploits economic opportunities, and preserves India’s broader commitments to rule‑based international order.

## Chapter X — Russia within BRICS: Narratives, Practice and Implications for India

Introduction

This section examines Russia’s evolving role and rhetoric within BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) from 2015 through 2025, situating Moscow’s approach in the broader contest over global governance, strategic autonomy and economic instruments. Russia presents BRICS as an instrument of multipolarity, a vehicle for Global South representation and a forum in which to develop alternatives to what it characterises as “weaponized” Western financial tools. For India—both a founding BRICS member and a key regional actor—these Russian narratives and initiatives intersect with New Delhi’s own strategic culture of non-alignment, calibrated engagement with the West, and interest in institutional reform that reflects developing-country priorities.

1. Major themes and framing

- Multipolarity: Russia consistently frames BRICS as a mechanism to shift international order away from Western hegemony. Moscow casts the grouping as a platform better attuned to the interests of the Global South and the Global East.
- Financial alternatives: Rather than an outright repudiation of the dollar, Russian officials describe BRICS work as preparedness for alternatives to a “weaponized” dollar—emphasising pragmatic development of payment, settlement and reserve arrangements.
- Non-confrontational posture: Official Russian messaging stresses that BRICS is “non-confrontational and constructive,” aiming to expand options rather than simply oppose Western institutions.
- Expansion and outreach: Russia has supported BRICS Plus/partner formats to broaden engagement while arguing that enlargement is not an end in itself and should not replicate the UN General Assembly’s universalism.
- Visibility and symbolism: Public perception and symbolic imagery (for example, the memorable depiction of a hypothetical BRICS banknote) sometimes outpace institutional deliverables.

2. Key statements and events (selected, 2015–2025)

- 2015: Vladimir Putin argued that, though young, BRICS was effective in shaping a multipolar order and fostering new financial/trading models.
- 2024, Kazan Summit: Putin foregrounded BRICS as central to an emerging multipolar order that reflects Global South/East interests; emphasised readiness for non-dollar mechanisms without advocating outright rejection.
- Oct 2024: Russian Foreign Ministry described BRICS as “non-confrontational and constructive” and a realistic alternative to “alien rules.”
- 2024: Putin quoted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s formulation that BRICS is “not anti‑Western but non‑Western,” a phrase that captured India’s own diplomatic posture within the grouping.
- Post-Kazan poll (2024): Among 1,500 Russian respondents, 39% had never heard of BRICS; among those aware, imagery (an informal BRICS currency note) was a salient memory—highlighting domestic visibility gaps.
- June 2024: Dmitry Medvedev chaired an International Inter‑party Forum in Vladivostok under the aegis of “BRICS and Partner Countries,” illustrating Russian efforts to operationalise outreach formats.
- 2025: Victoria Panova (head, BRICS Expert Council, Russia) warned that expansion should not be pursued for its own sake and cautioned against replicating UNGA-type universality.
- March 2025: Putin suggested BRICS countries could play a role in a Ukraine peace process, signalling a potential diplomatic use of the forum.
- Oct 2024 analyses (Dmitry Suslov, Valdai Club): External observers highlighted intra-BRICS fault lines—differing Western ties, tempo of reform (notably new currency/settlement mechanisms) and bilateral frictions (China–India; Saudi–Iran).

3. Principal actors and their roles (Russia and India in focus)

- Vladimir Putin: Principal Russian spokesperson in BRICS summits; promotes multipolar framing and pragmatic steps toward financial alternatives.
- Dmitry Medvedev: Active in outreach and party-level diplomacy (Vladivostok forum), signalling Russia’s desire to broaden BRICS networks beyond state-to-state summitry.
- Victoria Panova: Articulates constraints on expansion and underscores institution-building tradeoffs.
- Dmitry Suslov (Valdai): Independent analyst drawing attention to practical limits and divergence within BRICS.
- Narendra Modi: His “not anti‑Western but non‑Western” formulation has become a diplomatic touchstone, aligning India’s delicate balancing act with Russian efforts to shape the grouping’s posture.
- Xi Jinping and other leaders: China’s positions and bilateral relations (e.g., with India) remain structural determinants of BRICS outcomes.

4. Policy positions and narratives: implications for India

- Multipolarity vs status quo: Russia’s push for multipolarity resonates with India’s strategic preference for a diversified international order; however, New Delhi calibrates this against its economic and security relationships with Western powers.
- Dollar alternatives: India is interested in financial resilience and de-risking from unilateral financial coercion; any BRICS initiative on settlement systems or local‑currency arrangements will be evaluated against India’s own requirements for liquidity, convertibility and sanctions exposure.
- Non-confrontational branding: Modi’s phrasing provides India diplomatic space to participate in BRICS without being boxed into anti‑Western coalitions. This affords New Delhi strategic autonomy—participating in alternative architectures while maintaining Western partnerships.
- Expansion tradeoffs: India must weigh the political profile of prospective BRICS members (their geopolitical alignments, economic vulnerabilities and ties with the West) against the dilution of decision‑making and cohesion that larger membership could cause.
- Potential mediation: Russia’s suggestion of BRICS involvement in Ukraine’s peace process presents India with both an opportunity (to enhance its diplomatic utility) and a risk (managing credibility vis‑à‑vis Western partners and regional actors).

5. Operational and structural features constraining BRICS ambitions

- BRICS Plus / outreach: Expansion through partner formats enables broader engagement while avoiding immediate institutional overreach; yet it complicates consensus-building and may create tiered membership dilemmas.
- Decision-making heterogeneity: Varied national ties to the West and divergent domestic priorities slow accommodation on contentious reforms—especially monetary innovations that would require high trust and technical alignment.
- Public awareness and legitimacy: Low domestic awareness (e.g., 39% of surveyed Russians unfamiliar with BRICS) undermines claims that the grouping speaks for “the majority world”; symbolic images can temporarily boost visibility but risk substituting rhetoric for deliverables.
- Institutional thinness: BRICS lacks the dense bureaucratic architecture of established multilateral institutions, limiting its capacity for rapid operational rollout of complex financial mechanisms.

6. Risks and constraints (strategic assessment)

- Internal divergence: Deep-seated bilateral tensions (China–India), different threat perceptions, and asymmetric ties with the West impede unified action.
- Pace and feasibility of reform: Creating new currency or clearing mechanisms demands sustained investment, political will and technical interoperability—factors absent in the short term.
- Perception gaps: Moscow’s insistence on “non-confrontation” may not persuade Western governments or markets, all of whom could interpret enhanced BRICS financial coordination as strategic decoupling.
- Dilution of cohesion: Rapid enlargement risks turning BRICS into a loose consultative platform rather than a cohesive policy bloc capable of institutionalized action.

7. Opportunities and strategic implications for India

- Geopolitical diversification: A more institutionalised BRICS could give India additional diplomatic weight in forums outside Western-dominated institutions, helping advance developing countries’ priorities.
- Economic resilience: India can benefit from practical mechanisms that reduce single‑currency risks (bilateral rupee settlements, local currency trade corridors), provided such mechanisms preserve convertibility, liquidity and market confidence.
- Mediation and soft power: Participation in BRICS-led diplomatic initiatives—if carefully calibrated—could burnish India’s image as an impartial mediator and increase its influence among Global South states.
- Norm-shaping: India can leverage BRICS to push for governance reforms that reflect developing-country concerns (development finance, reform of IFIs), aligning institutional change with India’s long‑term strategic culture of gradual reformism.

8. Russia-specific context within BRICS

- Historical role: Since 2014, Russia has used BRICS to counterbalance Western isolation, amplifying its voice through multilateral channels where it can lead agenda-setting.
- Economic incentives: Sanctions exposure and restrictions on access to SWIFT and Western banking systems drive Russia’s interest in alternative settlement and reserve arrangements.
- Soft-power narrative: Moscow’s appeal to the “Global Majority” finds resonance among states disaffected with Western dominance, but Russia’s own diplomatic isolation and sanctions complicate outreach.
- Practical constraints: Domestic economic strain and resource limits constrain Russia’s capacity to fund and sustain large-scale BRICS initiatives over the long term.

9. Research agenda and recommended follow-up

To refine understanding of BRICS’ potential trajectory—and India’s strategic choices within it—the following areas merit focused analysis:

- Technical feasibility of alternatives: Detailed assessment of proposed dollar alternatives (clearing systems, regional reserve arrangements, or a common BRICS currency), including interoperability, liquidity backstops and market confidence implications.
- Membership dynamics: Monitor new applicants, their geopolitical orientations and economic linkages to the West, and model effects on consensus formation.
- Institutional design: Examine prospective governance reforms (decision rules, secretariat capacities, financial architecture) that could accelerate BRICS’ operationalisation.
- Public diplomacy strategies: Evaluate methods to raise domestic and international awareness of BRICS’ tangible deliverables—beyond summit imagery—to build legitimacy.
- Mediation feasibility in Ukraine: Identify which BRICS members have credible access to principal parties, what negotiation frameworks might be acceptable, and how Indian participation would affect New Delhi’s strategic calculus.

Conclusion

Russia positions BRICS as a pragmatic instrument of multipolarity: a space to develop alternatives to perceived Western dominance while maintaining a non‑confrontational public posture. For India, the grouping offers strategic opportunities—diplomatic visibility, economic diversification and normative influence—yet also presents dilemmas tied to institutional thinness, intra‑group divergence and the technical challenges of devising credible financial alternatives. New Delhi’s strategic culture—anchored in calibrated autonomy, institutional reformism and normative leadership among developing states—will determine how it engages with Russian-led BRICS initiatives: whether to steer the grouping toward constructive, incremental institutionalisation, or to remain a cautious participant preserving ties with Western partners while exploiting BRICS for selective benefits.

### 6.X Zelensky’s Criticism of the UN and the Kazan BRICS Summit (October 2024): Source, Context and Consequences

Summary
- In an October 2024 interview with The Times of India, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the BRICS leaders’ summit held in Kazan, Russia, as a “total failure” and explicitly criticised the presence of the UN Secretary‑General at the event. The Secretary‑General’s office subsequently issued a clarification, framing his attendance as related to BRICS’ role “in boosting global co‑operation.” This episode sits at the intersection of great‑power contestation, institutional neutrality, and the diplomacy of strategic autonomy—all themes central to India’s strategic culture and national security calculations.

1. Source and primary claim
- Source: Interview given by President Volodymyr Zelensky to The Times of India (October 2024).  
- Primary public claim: Zelensky labelled the Kazan summit a “total failure” and singled out the Secretary‑General’s presence for criticism.  
- Event identification: The Kazan summit refers to a BRICS leaders’ meeting hosted in Kazan, Russia.

2. Political and normative context
- Sensitivity of meetings on Russian soil: Since Russia’s full‑scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, high‑level engagements held in Russia are politically sensitive for Kyiv and many Western governments. Attendance by senior international figures can be perceived as conferring legitimacy on the host.  
- Zelensky’s rhetorical objective: Calling the summit a “total failure” serves to delegitimise both the summit’s outcomes and its host, shaping international perception and reinforcing Ukraine’s broader narrative to partners.  
- BRICS’ evolving role: BRICS—originally Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa—has been pursuing expansion and enhanced diplomatic prominence as an alternative multilateral platform representing much of the Global South. For its members, increased visibility and recognition are strategic objectives.

3. The UN’s diplomatic balancing act
- Institutional dilemma: The Secretary‑General routinely faces a choice between engagement (maintaining channels to influence multilateral outcomes and advance UN mandates) and non‑engagement (avoiding actions that could be read as legitimising controversial actors).  
- UN response: The Secretary‑General’s office issued a clarification that framed his attendance in terms of BRICS’ potential contribution to “boosting global co‑operation,” signalling a choice to emphasise engagement over abstention.  
- Implications of that choice: The UN’s justification reflects a calculus to preserve institutional access and relevance across diverse groupings, even at the cost of generating political criticism from member states that view such engagement as problematic.

4. Implications and likely consequences
- Perception risk for the UN: Attendance by the Secretary‑General at a summit hosted by Russia can be portrayed as tacit endorsement of the host, potentially eroding perceptions of UN neutrality—especially among states and publics aligned with Ukraine.  
- Reputational dynamics for BRICS: Zelensky’s condemnation feeds narratives, particularly in Western media and among governments critical of Russia, that BRICS lacks credibility on peace and security issues; simultaneously BRICS members can point to the Secretary‑General’s presence as evidence of wider legitimacy.  
- Diplomatic effects for Ukraine: Kyiv’s public criticism keeps the Ukraine narrative in view and seeks to mobilise diplomatic pressure, but it may have limited practical effect on internal BRICS dynamics where some members maintain close ties with Russia.  
- Geopolitical signalling: The episode illustrates the widening divergence between Western positions on Russia/Ukraine and the engagement preferences of many BRICS/Global South actors—a divergence with implications for alliance politics and contestation within multilateral forums.  
- Operational/organizational consequences: Depending on follow‑on reactions, the incident could prompt pressures on UN programming, influence member‑state cooperation, affect public messaging on the Ukraine conflict, and complicate fundraising or operational partnerships in contexts tied to Russia or BRICS members.

5. Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- India’s diplomatic posture: As a founding BRICS member pursuing strategic autonomy, India routinely balances ties with Russia, partnerships with Western states, and its leadership ambitions in the Global South. The Kazan episode highlights the dilemmas inherent in that posture—engage, preserve institutional channels, and protect policy space versus distancing to avoid reputational costs.  
- Strategic culture echoes: India’s long‑standing emphasis on non‑alignment or strategic autonomy predisposes it to value engagement with diverse multilateral formations (including BRICS) while managing fallout from great‑power competition. How India reads UN engagement with BRICS will shape its messaging and its own calibration in forums where Western and Global South positions diverge.  
- National security implications: Reputational spillovers, shifting alignments within multilateral spaces, and pressure on UN operations can all have downstream effects on India’s diplomatic manoeuvring, crisis diplomacy, and coalition building on issues from development finance to security cooperation.

6. Sources, verification and caveats
- Primary media source: President Zelensky’s interview in The Times of India (October 2024) — the full text should be consulted for precise wording and context.  
- Official response: Statement or clarification from the office of the UN Secretary‑General regarding his participation — the full statement is necessary to ascertain nuance and intended framing.  
- Verification note: Analysts should consult the primary texts (interview transcript and UN statement), BRICS communiqués, and contemporaneous member‑state reactions to avoid reliance on secondary paraphrase.

7. Recommended monitoring and next steps for policy analysts
- Track BRICS documents: Monitor summit communiqués and individual member statements to see how outcomes are framed and whether the Secretary‑General’s participation is subsequently referenced.  
- Follow UN messaging: Watch for fuller explanations from the Secretary‑General, the UN spokesperson, and subsequent UN engagements with Ukraine to assess institutional positioning and damage control.  
- Observe Western coordination: Monitor responses from major Western governments and EU institutions for coordinated criticism or diplomatic steps that might shape consequences for UN and BRICS engagement.  
- Monitor Kyiv’s diplomacy: Follow Ukrainian government messaging and any diplomatic initiatives launched in response to international figures’ attendance at Russian‑hosted events.  
- Assess operational impacts: Track any changes to UN cooperation, funding discussions, or on‑the‑ground programmes that might be affected by reputational pressures stemming from the episode.

Conclusion
- The Zelensky–UN–Kazan episode is a compact case study in the tensions between engagement and legitimacy in contemporary multilateral diplomacy. For India—whose strategic culture prizes autonomy, engagement with the Global South, and careful balancing between great‑power blocs—the diplomatic ripples from such incidents must be read contextually and managed prudently as part of broader national security strategy.

### BRICS: Cohesion, De‑dollarization, and Strategic Implications for India and the United States

This section synthesizes scholarship, policy commentary, and recent political developments (2013–2025) to assess BRICS’ internal dynamics, its de‑dollarization rhetoric and initiatives, and what these mean for major powers and for India’s strategic posture. The evidence is mixed: BRICS has gained institutional heft and negotiating leverage, yet its heterogeneity and practical limits constrain the group’s capacity to displace established global financial architecture quickly. For India—whose strategic culture prizes autonomy, development, and calibrated balancing—the trajectory of BRICS presents both opportunities and policy dilemmas.

1. Cohesion, heterogeneity, and leadership dynamics
- Early skepticism about BRICS cohesion remains analytically useful. Isobel Coleman (CFR, 2013) emphasized deep internal differences: political systems range from consolidated liberal democracies (Brazil, South Africa) to authoritarian or oligarchic models (Russia), and economic scales differ widely. These differences shape preferences and bargaining power.
- China’s economic predominance within BRICS is salient. By some counts (post‑expansion reserve arrangements), China contributes a disproportionately large share of pooled resources (e.g., >41% in some joint reserve constructs), which translates into informal influence—but not automatic political unanimity. Economic weight gives China tools to shape agendas, yet differing national priorities and relationships with the West limit a simple “China‑run bloc” narrative.
- Expansion trade‑offs matter. Adding members raises aggregate market reach and diplomatic weight, but it also multiplies divergent interests and decision‑making frictions—weakening the capacity for cohesive, rapid action on contentious issues.

2. BRICS’ evolving purpose: development, multipolarity, and bargaining leverage
- Recent academic work (multi‑year Tufts study, July 2023) challenges reductive portrayals of BRICS as merely anti‑U.S. or China‑dominated. The group coheres around shared development objectives (infrastructure finance, alternative governance norms) and a normative preference for a multipolar order that avoids single‑power dominance.
- This consolidation has translated into incremental but meaningful gains: improved negotiation leverage in multilateral fora, new institutions (e.g., New Development Bank), and coordinated voting patterns that can shift governance norms away from Western defaults.

3. De‑dollarization: rhetoric, mechanisms, and practical limits
- What de‑dollarization means: efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. dollar in trade invoicing, foreign exchange reserves, and cross‑border payments—motivated by a desire to lower exposure to U.S. monetary policy, exchange‑rate risk, and the coercive reach of U.S. sanctions.
- Mechanisms already in use are incremental rather than revolutionary: bilateral currency swap lines, local‑currency settlement agreements, and regional payment platforms (examples include Russia–China arrangements and other state‑level swaps). These create alternatives for select corridors and transactions but do not replicate the depth, liquidity, and safety of dollar‑centred capital markets.
- Practical limits to a BRICS reserve currency: delivering a credible alternative to the dollar requires deep, liquid, globally trusted capital markets; transparent macroeconomic and monetary policy frameworks; a functioning lender‑of‑last‑resort mechanism; and broad creditor confidence. BRICS members collectively lack many of these preconditions today. Hence large‑scale replacement of the dollar is unlikely in the short to medium term.
- The role of payments infrastructure and sanctions: the dollar’s centrality is reinforced by Western‑dominated payment systems (SWIFT and correspondent banking networks) that magnify the effect of sanctions. Diversified payment rails and local‑currency arrangements can blunt—but not eliminate—this leverage for some actors and regions.

4. Competing assessments of the threat to the dollar and U.S. interests
- Warnings: Analysts such as Thomas Hill (Atlantic Council, Dec 2023) warn that de‑dollarization efforts—particularly in North Africa and other regions—could undermine U.S. fiscal flexibility (ability to run persistent deficits at low rates) and attenuate the potency of sanctions and SWIFT‑based measures.
- Skepticism: Michael Kugelman (BBC) and other commentators stress economic constraints facing many BRICS members and partners: shallow capital markets, limited global liquidity in alternative currencies, and the inertia of existing trade and financial relationships make wholesale abandonment of the dollar impractical for most economies.
- U.S. official posture has been mixed: senior White House and National Security Council officials at times publicly downplayed BRICS as a serious geopolitical rival (including statements after the 2023 expansion). Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has characterized de‑dollarization efforts as not posing a material threat to the dollar’s central role—reflecting confidence in institutional depth and network effects that sustain the dollar.

5. Politics, coercion, and legal constraints
- Political signaling: U.S. domestic politics shape rhetoric. High‑visibility threats—most notably by former President Donald Trump (postings and remarks in Nov 2024 and a Feb 2025 briefing claiming “BRICS is dead” after threatened tariffs of 100–150%)—are as much domestic signaling as credible, enforceable policy. Such threats raise questions about feasibility and potential blowback.
- Practical and legal constraints: Blanket tariff penalties targeted at countries for choosing an alternative currency would likely face severe legal challenges in the WTO, risk triggering trade wars, and could harm U.S. economic and diplomatic interests. Implementation would therefore be difficult and carry notable costs.

6. BRICS utility for isolated states and intra‑organizational limits
- Joseph Nye (Jan 2025) observes that BRICS offers diplomatic space for states facing Western isolation (Russia, Iran)—a functional benefit even if the group’s systemic objectives are limited. Nye cautions that expansion can worsen intra‑group rivalries and reduce overall effectiveness.
- Behavioral moderation: Observers such as Melissa Pistilli note that Russia’s rhetoric at the 2024 BRICS summit appeared to moderate—shifting from strident de‑dollarization calls to critiquing the “weaponization” of the dollar. Such rhetorical shifts underscore the difference between public signaling and operational policy.

7. Implications for U.S. policy (policy options and trade‑offs)
- Monitor: Systematically track BRICS financial initiatives—new payment platforms, reserve pooling, swap lines—for tangible indicators of dollar displacement.
- Engage: Address development grievances that drive countries toward parallel arrangements (offer competitive development finance, greater market access, and credible multilateral reform).
- Harden countermeasures: Enhance interoperability with allies’ financial systems to preserve sanctions effectiveness and, where desirable, develop resilient alternative channels for legitimate commerce.
- Assess costs of coercion: Carefully weigh legal, economic, and geopolitical fallout from punitive measures (tariffs, secondary sanctions) that aim to deter de‑dollarization.
- Promote resilience: Encourage allies to diversify reserve holdings and payment arrangements to reduce vulnerability if BRICS initiatives progress.
- Support reform: Work within IMF, World Bank, and other institutions to make governance more inclusive—reducing incentives for states to seek parallel institutions.

8. Credibility and sources: reading the evidence carefully
- The literature and public statements span think tanks (CFR, Atlantic Council), academic studies (Tufts), major media analysis (BBC), official U.S. government statements, and political pronouncements (Trump’s posts/speeches). Each source carries different weights: peer‑reviewed and multi‑year academic studies provide stronger empirical grounding; think‑tank and policy commentary are normative and situated within particular outlooks; public political rhetoric can be high on signaling and low on implementability.
- Temporal context matters: Coleman’s 2013 skepticism about cohesion must be read alongside 2023–2025 developments showing both institutional deepening and persistent limits.

9. What this means for India’s strategic culture and policy
- Fit with Indian strategic culture: BRICS aligns with India’s emphasis on multipolarity, development cooperation, and strategic autonomy. India has used BRICS to secure development finance, diplomatic space, and influence on reform agendas for global governance.
- Prudence on de‑dollarization: India faces tradeoffs. Greater use of local currency trade settlements and selective swap lines can reduce transaction costs and political exposure, but India will not—and realistically cannot—abandon dollar‑based arrangements given the depth of its trade ties, external borrowing needs, and desire to maintain access to global capital markets.
- Balancing act: India should continue to exploit BRICS’ institutional space for development and diplomatic bargaining while preserving interoperability with Western financial systems and maintaining the credibility of its macroeconomic and regulatory frameworks to attract capital.
- Practical steps for India: expand selective local‑currency arrangements where economically sensible; invest in payment‑system connectivity that preserves options; leverage BRICS membership to advocate for more inclusive multilateral institutions; avoid binary alignment that would reduce flexibility in crisis management or access to Western financial safety nets.

10. Summary judgment
BRICS has moved from a loose diplomatic club to a more consequential platform for development cooperation and contestation over governance norms. Yet the group’s heterogeneity, practical financial‑market constraints, and the entrenched advantages of the dollar make rapid systemic displacement unlikely. For India, BRICS is a useful instrument for advancing development goals and strategic autonomy, but prudent hedging—maintaining deep links to global dollar‑based finance while selectively expanding alternative mechanisms—best serves national security and economic interests. U.S. policymakers, for their part, must calibrate engagement and deterrence carefully: respond to concrete, operational threats to dollar predominance while addressing underlying grievances that feed demand for parallel institutions.

## 8.X Western Skepticism and the BRICS Debate: Implications for India’s Strategic Posture

This section examines contemporary Western commentary on BRICS that followed the August 2023 summit and a 2024 assessment, situating those reactions in the wider debate about BRICS’ significance for global order and for India’s strategic culture. The perspectives of two prominent British commentators — Con Coughlin and Jim O’Neill — frame much of the sceptical reading in the English‑language press. Their claims are presented alongside the structural realities of BRICS (composition and recent expansion), the arguments about Chinese influence, the limits imposed by intra‑BRICS fissures (most notably China–India tensions), the rhetoric-versus‑substance question, and practical policy options for Western states and India.

1. Context and the commentators
- Timing and provenance: The commentary reviewed here is a contemporary reaction to the August 2023 BRICS summit and a 2024 remark. Both voices reflect a Western frame of reference — they are British and write from within the norms of Western strategic discourse.
- Con Coughlin: As defence and foreign affairs editor at The Daily Telegraph, Coughlin voices a strongly sceptical assessment. He argues that BRICS presents a Chinese‑driven vehicle for extending Beijing’s influence, but that its effort to challenge the established order is “destined to failure” because of internal contradictions.
- Jim O’Neill: The economist who coined “BRIC” offers a more measured technical critique in 2024, arguing that much BRICS activity leans toward rhetoric and symbolism rather than decisive policy shifts. O’Neill’s standing as an originator of the coinage gives his observations particular weight in debates over the grouping’s evolution.

2. Core sceptical claims and the strategic recommendation
- Core claim: Critics assert BRICS lacks the institutional coherence and shared strategic purpose necessary to displace the post‑war (and post‑Cold War) architecture centred on Western institutions. The accusation is not only that BRICS is ineffective, but that China seeks to use it instrumentally to normalize alternative norms and build parallel institutions.
- Strategic recommendation: Coughlin (and similar commentators) call for intensified Western engagement with India — proposing a new strategic alignment that can serve as a counterweight to Chinese influence. This entails deeper defence cooperation, intelligence sharing, trade agreements, and coordination in like‑minded fora (for example, strengthening ties through Quad, and exploring AUKUS‑adjacent partnerships).

3. Why concerns about Chinese influence arise
- Platforms for agenda‑setting: Multilateral groupings create venues where agenda, terminology, and alternatives to dominant practices can be promoted. The New Development Bank (NDB) and discussions about currency‑swap arrangements are cited as examples where non‑Western institutions might offer practical alternatives to IMF/World Bank–centred financing.
- Perception vs intent: Western anxieties reflect the plausible intent that China will use any multilateral platform to advance strategic and economic interests. Whether actual outcomes follow depends on institutional rules, transparency, and member buy‑in.

4. Composition, expansion and the challenge of diversity
- From BRIC to BRICS and beyond: BRICS originally comprised Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Since 2023 the grouping has expanded, increasing geographic breadth and political diversity by admitting new members. Expansion complicates consensus formation but also can strengthen the grouping by enlarging its resource and diplomatic base.
- Heterogeneous interests: Members pursue overlapping interests (e.g., demand for reform of global financial governance) but retain divergent priorities on security, trade and geopolitics. This heterogeneity limits the speed and scope of collective action.

5. Internal contradictions — the China–India dynamic
- Bilateral tensions as a constraint: The China–India border dispute and broader rivalry over regional influence are concrete reminders that BRICS members can be strategic competitors. Such tensions reduce trust and complicate attempts at unified positions on major geopolitical issues.
- India’s strategic autonomy: India’s posture in BRICS is shaped by its long-standing preference for autonomy — it values economic cooperation and alternatives to a dollar‑centred system, yet resists aligning in a way that compromises its independent strategic choices.

6. Rhetoric versus substance — evidence on both sides
- Critics’ view: Observers such as O’Neill argue BRICS often issues strong declarations but lacks follow‑through; symbolic unity contrasts with modest institutionalized output.
- Supporters’ view: Defenders point to tangible steps — NDB lending, localized currency‑swap negotiations, and members seeking alternative payment mechanisms — as incremental but meaningful shifts that reduce dependence on Western systems.
- Empirical test: The grouping’s long‑term impact will be judged by the scale, frequency and legal‑institutional depth of projects (e.g., multilateral financing with meaningful conditionality, cross‑border payments mechanisms, coordinated diplomatic action).

7. Policy implications for the UK/West and for India
- For the West (including the UK): Practical options include deeper strategic engagement with India (defence ties, technology cooperation), pragmatic engagement with other emerging economies, reinvigorating rules‑based institutions to remain attractive, and offering economic/security incentives that respect partners’ autonomy.
- For India: BRICS represents a platform to expand economic options and diplomatic space without full alignment. India can exploit both BRICS and closer Western ties, preserving strategic autonomy while securing technology, investments and security partnerships. India’s calculus balances immediate economic gains against long‑term strategic positioning vis‑à‑vis China and Russia.

8. Counterarguments and a balanced assessment
- Mixed reality: The sceptical narrative underestimates BRICS’ incremental institutionalization while the optimistic narrative may overstate its ability to supplant entrenched Western institutions. Both rhetoric and substance are present: symbolic diplomacy coexists with concrete financial and trade initiatives aimed at diversification.
- Agency of smaller members: Non‑Chinese members are not passive instruments; they have agency, domestic constraints and alternative alignments that can blunt any single member’s hegemonic designs.

9. Analytical takeaway
- The Western sceptical framing — highlighting Chinese influence and internal contradictions — correctly identifies important constraints on BRICS’ capacity to overhaul the global order. Yet it should not dismiss the group’s capacity to produce practical shifts, especially in finance and trade, that matter to participating countries.
- For India, BRICS is a strategic instrument among many. Its value lies in diversification of partnerships, leveraging institutional alternatives without forfeiting autonomy, and extracting tangible economic benefits while hedging security risks.

Concise conclusion
Western commentary casts BRICS as an often‑symbolic grouping vulnerable to Chinese instrumentalization and internal fissures (notably China–India tensions), urging stronger Western‑India strategic ties as a counterweight. The reality is more nuanced: BRICS combines rhetorical posturing with some institutional steps (NDB activities, currency‑swap talks), and its ultimate impact will hinge on member cohesion, the ambition and enforceability of concrete projects, and how major powers (including India and Western states) respond strategically.

## Global opinion on BRICS: Evidence from a Gallup International poll (Oct–Dec 2023)

This short analytical note reports and interprets public-opinion data on BRICS drawn from a Gallup International survey fielded between October and December 2023. The findings matter for India’s strategic culture and national security policy because public awareness and sentiment toward multilateral groupings shape domestic political space for foreign policy choices, inform public diplomacy priorities, and influence the alliance’s external legitimacy.

### Summary of key findings
- The poll finds substantial global unfamiliarity with BRICS—phrased in the headline as “almost a third” of respondents had never heard of BRICS—indicating a significant awareness gap for an organization that claims growing international relevance.
- Western publics were markedly more negative toward BRICS than many non‑Western publics.
- Countries with the highest negative shares in the sample included Sweden (45%), Spain (30%), the United States (30%), Portugal (29%), and Ukraine (29%).
- Countries with the strongest net positive attitudes included Russia (net +38%), Iran (net +37%), Nigeria (net +36%), Saudi Arabia (net +33%), and Malaysia (net +32%).
- India registered mixed public sentiment: 36% of respondents in India viewed BRICS positively while 29% viewed it negatively.

### Detailed country results (as reported)
- Sweden: highest negative share (45%).
- Spain: negative share 30%.
- United States: negative share 30%.
- Portugal: negative share 29%.
- Ukraine: negative share 29%.
- Russia: net positive 38%.
- Iran: net positive 37%.
- Nigeria: net positive 36%.
- Saudi Arabia: net positive 33%.
- Malaysia: net positive 32%.
- India: positive 36%, negative 29% (mixed domestic sentiment).

### Interpretation and inferences
Several interpretive points follow from these raw patterns:

1. Awareness gap and soft‑power limits
   - That nearly one third of respondents globally had not heard of BRICS points to a fundamental soft‑power and visibility problem. Institutional claims to represent an alternative global governance pole are weakened if broad publics lack basic awareness.

2. Regional polarization
   - The pronounced negativity in Western and certain European publics contrasts with positive sentiment in many non‑Western states. This polarization reflects competing geopolitical narratives: Western media and political elites often frame BRICS in adversarial terms, whereas publics in some Eurasian, Middle Eastern and African states may view BRICS as an avenue for diversification from Western‑centric institutions.

3. Domestic and geopolitical drivers of opinion
   - High net positivity in Russia and Iran likely reflects state narratives and geopolitical alignment. Positive attitudes in some Global South countries (Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia) may reflect either pragmatic economic expectations or local elites’ favorable framing.
   - Conversely, negative majorities in parts of Europe and the United States reflect not only geopolitical rivalry but also media framing and public perceptions of BRICS members’ governance norms.

4. India’s ambivalence
   - India’s split (36% positive; 29% negative) suggests ambivalence among its citizens despite India’s founding role. This ambivalence has meaning for India’s strategic culture: domestic audiences may permit flexible, transactional engagement with BRICS if benefits are clear, but popular concern or skepticism can constrain deep institutional commitments perceived as adversarial to Western partners.

5. Caution about what “net positivity” means
   - Net-positive scores likely indicate favorable impressions rather than detailed understanding of BRICS’ policies, institutional mechanisms, or capabilities. Superficial favorability can be fragile.

### Methodological notes and caveats
Any use of these results must account for methodological limitations:
- “Almost a third” is imprecise. The exact awareness rate, country sample sizes, and weighting procedures are necessary to assess representativeness.
- Timing matters: late‑2023 debates (for example, public discussion of BRICS expansion) could have temporarily influenced attitudes.
- Country‑level statistics are single metrics reported in summary form; response biases, differing question wordings, and survey mode (online vs. face‑to‑face) vary across contexts and affect comparability.
- The report mixes negative‑share percentages and net‑positivity figures; analysts must be careful not to conflate these different metrics when making cross‑country comparisons.

### Strategic implications for BRICS and for India
For the grouping as a whole:
- Public diplomacy gap: Low awareness and negative sentiment in influential Western publics limit BRICS’ ability to claim global legitimacy and to influence international norms.
- Expansion constraints: Low recognition and regional resistance could complicate formal enlargement or institutionalization efforts.

For India specifically:
- Domestic political constraints: Mixed public opinion constrains the government’s ability to fully align with any BRICS posture that might alarm major partners in the West. India’s strategic culture—prizing autonomy and strategic hedging—means that domestic receptivity to BRICS initiatives matters for policy flexibility.
- Narrative competition: Western negativity toward BRICS increases pressure on Indian policymakers to manage bilateral relations (especially with the United States and EU members) while sustaining ties with BRICS partners.
- Leverage and limits: India can exploit positive sentiment in parts of the Global South to build pragmatic, issue‑based coalitions inside BRICS (trade, development finance, connectivity), but must also manage the optics of association with members that are viewed negatively in key Western capitals.

### Recommended actions (for Indian policymakers and BRICS stakeholders)
1. Obtain and publish disaggregated poll data
   - Commission or request the full survey microdata (sample sizes, question wording, mode) to enable targeted policy‑relevant analysis.

2. Targeted awareness campaigns
   - Develop succinct, audience‑specific public diplomacy explaining BRICS’ objectives, cooperation mechanisms, and tangible benefits for partner countries and for India’s economy.

3. Western media engagement
   - Proactively engage Western media and think tanks to explain BRICS initiatives and to counter simplified adversarial narratives; emphasize economic cooperation and development goals where appropriate.

4. Leverage positive‑opinion states
   - Use countries with favourable public opinion as regional hubs for outreach, joint events, and cooperative projects that personify BRICS’ developmental agenda.

5. Monitor attitudes over time
   - Establish periodic polling to detect shifts following major BRICS events (expansion, summits, new institutions) and adjust public diplomacy accordingly.

### Conclusion
The Gallup International results from late 2023 portray BRICS as an institution with uneven global recognition and sharply divergent regional reputations. For India—both as a founding member and as a state balancing Western engagement and South–South cooperation—these attitudes are consequential. They point to an imperative in India’s strategic culture: to sustain autonomous, multi‑vector diplomacy while cultivating domestic and international narratives that make multilateral choices politically viable at home and comprehensible abroad.

### Appendix: Snapshot of BRICS Leadership — Data, Context, and Implications for India

Summary
- The source material is a simple two-row table listing national representatives for BRICS, mixing the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) with several countries presented as additional/new members (Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, United Arab Emirates). Most image fields are empty; one entry contains an image filename.
- The table’s columns are Member (country), Image, Name (individual leader as listed), and Position (official title). The dataset is clearly a raw capture that requires validation, cleansing and timestamping before any operational use.

Named entries in the source (as listed)
- Brazil — Lula da Silva: listed as “President of Brazil.” Context: in Brazil’s presidential system the president is both head of state and government and thus Brazil’s principal BRICS representative.
- Russia — Vladimir Putin: listed as “President of Russia.” Context: Putin is the head of state and the principal interlocutor for Russia in BRICS affairs.
- India — Narendra Modi: listed as “Prime Minister of India.” Context: in India’s parliamentary system the prime minister is the executive national representative on summit-level diplomacy; Modi is therefore the principal BRICS interlocutor for India.
- China — Xi Jinping: listed as “President of China.” Context: Xi is China’s paramount leader and represents China at head-of-state level in BRICS.
- South Africa — Cyril Ramaphosa: listed as “President of South Africa.” Context: Ramaphosa functions as South Africa’s head of state and government in BRICS contexts.
- Egypt — Abdel Fattah el‑Sisi: listed as “President of Egypt.” Context: presidents typically lead national delegations in summit diplomacy.
- Ethiopia — Abiy Ahmed: listed as “Prime Minister of Ethiopia.” Context: as head of government, Abiy would be Ethiopia’s BRICS interlocutor.
- Indonesia — Prabowo Subianto: listed as “President of Indonesia.” Note: this entry flags an immediate verification requirement — Indonesia’s BRICS membership and the current head-of-state/head-of-government attribution must be cross-checked against authoritative records.
- Iran — Masoud Pezeshkian: listed as “President of Iran”; the Image cell contains “thumb.jpg.” Note: verify the currency and official title (and whether image links are valid) before publication.
- United Arab Emirates — Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan: listed as “President of the United Arab Emirates.” Context: MBZ is the UAE’s president and primary international representative.

Quality-control observations
- Data completeness: image links are missing or inconsistent (one “thumb.jpg” only); if visual identification is necessary, images must be sourced or image fields cleaned/removed.
- Consistency of roles: the table mixes “President” and “Prime Minister” titles, reflecting different political systems; this is appropriate but should be standardized in metadata (e.g., clarify whether the listed person is head of state, head of government, or both).
- Membership mix: original BRICS members are combined with countries presented as additions. The source does not document accession dates, the round of expansion, or the formal acceptance process.
- Potential inaccuracies/omissions: several states publicly reported as BRICS invitees in media coverage (e.g., Argentina, Saudi Arabia) are absent; conversely, Indonesia appears though its membership status in the source is uncertain. Leadership names are time-sensitive.

Implications for diplomacy and India’s strategic culture
- Summit-level representation matters. The identities and ranks of national representatives determine who negotiates, co-signs communiqués, and shapes BRICS agenda items. For India, the fact that the prime minister represents Delhi at BRICS summits means New Delhi places high strategic value on this forum for political messaging and coalition-building.
- Expanded membership affects India’s strategic calculations. Addition of states such as Iran, UAE, Egypt or Ethiopia changes issue-areas (energy, finance, West Asian diplomacy, African engagement). India’s national security policy must therefore adapt to a broader BRICS agenda that may include energy security, development finance, and alternative financial architecture topics beyond the India–China–Russia triad.
- Diplomatic management: changes in leadership (electoral turnover, internal instability) directly alter bilateral chemistry within BRICS and can affect issue alignment on sanctions, trade corridors, conflict management, and multilateral reform — all relevant to India’s strategic autonomy and global posture.

Operational implications (protocol, scheduling, contact)
- For operational use (protocol, meeting planning, or contact tracing), the “Position” field is useful but insufficient. It must be paired with:
  - Verified current office-holder
  - Official office address and protocol channel
  - Biographical notes relevant to portfolios (e.g., foreign policy priorities)
  - Date of validation for every data point
- Leadership turnover or contested recognition requires closer monitoring because such changes can rapidly change access, negotiation leverage, and policy alignments.

Recommendations
- Verification: Cross-check every leader-name, title, and membership status against authoritative sources prior to publication — official government websites, BRICS summit communiqués, and reputable international press.
- Data hygiene: Normalize table structure; remove or populate image fields consistently; add metadata fields such as “date of validation,” “source,” and “role type” (head of state / head of government).
- Contextual enrichment: Append accession dates (original founding vs expansion round), and note attendance at recent BRICS summits to show active participation versus formal membership.
- Risk assessment: Flag countries with contested recognition or volatile domestic politics for higher-frequency updates because they pose greater uncertainty for coalition continuity.
- Next steps: compile a verified master list, timestamp it, and maintain an update schedule (e.g., monthly checks or after major national elections) if the dataset will be used for diplomatic planning or national security analysis.

Notes for the reader
- This appendix treats the provided table as a snapshot and offers analytic and quality-control guidance. Leadership and membership data are time-sensitive: treat all names and titles here as provisional and verify before operational or academic citation.
