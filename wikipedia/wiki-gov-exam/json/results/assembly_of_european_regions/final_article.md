### The Assembly of European Regions (AER): A Model of Transnational Regionalism and Lessons for India

The Assembly of European Regions (AER) is commonly described as the largest independent network of regions in “wider Europe.” At its core it aggregates sub‑national territorial authorities—provinces, states, autonomous regions and their equivalents—and channels their collective voice in supranational and intergovernmental arenas. AER’s membership traditionally spans dozens of regions drawn from many European states (the outline notes a snapshot of regions from 25 countries and the inclusion of 15 interregional organizations), but those specific figures should be treated as a temporal snapshot and checked against the organisation’s current records.

Definitional and organisational clarity
- “Regions” here denotes intermediate levels of government between municipalities and national governments: entities with political and administrative responsibilities that vary across countries (e.g. German Länder, Spain’s comunidades autónomas, Italian regions).
- AER’s description as “independent” is consequential: it is not an EU institution and it does not represent national governments. Rather, it is a transnational association or network that voluntarily brings together sub‑national actors for cooperation and representation.
- “Wider Europe” signals geographical breadth beyond EU membership: Western, Central and Eastern European territories, and often parts of the Balkans and the Caucasus, are eligible for engagement—so membership crosses EU/non‑EU boundaries.
- Its membership is mixed: in addition to individual regions, AER includes interregional organisations—networks composed of regions themselves—so AER is an aggregation of both single regional governments and federations or associations of regions.

Core roles and activities
AER functions as a forum and platform for interregional cooperation. Typical activities and functions include:
- Facilitating policy exchange and mutual learning among regional governments on governance, economic development, environment, social policy and territorial cohesion;
- Promoting regional interests in European policy debates and advocating for subsidiarity—the principle that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to citizens;
- Developing and managing joint projects (often financed from EU or international funds) that promote cross‑border cooperation, innovation and capacity building;
- Building administrative and technical capacity among member regions through trainings, workshops and twinning arrangements;
- Fostering cross‑border and transnational cooperation in areas such as transport, environment, economic development and migration management.

Value proposition and strategic relevance
By aggregating many regional actors and interregional bodies, AER enhances the political visibility and negotiating weight of sub‑national actors in multilevel governance. Networks such as AER can:
- Serve as incubators for policy innovation that national governments or supranational institutions later adopt or scale up;
- Act as interlocutors for the European Commission, the Council of Europe and other international bodies when regional perspectives are sought on cohesion, cross‑border infrastructure, or social and economic policy;
- Reinforce territorial cohesion by enabling coordination of cross‑border development strategies and by advocating for regional needs in budgetary and legislative processes.

Analytical caveats
- Data currency: the numerical claims (e.g., 25 countries, 15 interregional organisations) reflect a point‑in‑time count. For scholarly work that requires precision, consult AER’s official membership list and recent annual reports.
- Heterogeneity: member regions differ greatly in competencies, resources and political influence; the extent to which AER can represent a cohesive regional position is therefore contingent and issue‑specific.

Implications and recommendations (particularly relevant for Indian readers and analysts)
- Implication: AER exemplifies how sub‑national actors can coordinate transnationally to influence higher‑level policy. For analysts of India’s strategic culture and national security, this model highlights the potential of regional networks to contribute to external engagement and domestic resilience (e.g., cross‑border trade corridors, disaster management, coastal security cooperation).
- Recommendation — verification: Always confirm contemporary membership and institutional data from primary sources (AER website, recent statutes or annual reports).
- Recommendation — institutional study: To assess AER’s influence, examine its internal governance (assembly, bureau, committees), flagship initiatives, stated policy priorities, and recent projects or position papers.
- Recommendation — mapping influence: If analysing political impact, map AER activities and policy outputs against EU, Council of Europe and other international decision processes to identify where the network shapes agenda setting, implementation or funding decisions.
- Lesson for India: Consider institutionalising interstate and cross‑border regional networks that permit Indian states to share best practice, coordinate on border security and infrastructure, and represent regional interests in central and international fora—while carefully preserving constitutional balance and central coordination in matters of national security and foreign policy.

Conclusion
AER is a paradigmatic case of transnational regionalism: an independent, mixed membership network that amplifies sub‑national voices in wider European governance. For scholars of India’s strategic culture, it offers both a practical template and a cautionary tale—demonstrating how regional aggregation can augment policy influence and service delivery, while also underscoring the need to align such networks with national constitutional responsibilities and strategic priorities.

### The Assembly of European Regions (AER): a compact case study in regional networking and its lessons for India

This section presents a concise, evidence‑based account of the Assembly of European Regions (AER) — its origins, evolution, programmatic priorities and institutional effects — and draws out the contemporary relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policymaking. AER’s trajectory illustrates how organised sub‑national actors can shape supranational governance, reframe political space, and deploy youth and mobility programmes as instruments of long‑term capacity and identity‑building. All points summarised here derive from the chronological and analytical outline provided.

1. Origins and institutionalisation (1985–1987)
- 15 June 1985, Louvain‑la‑Neuve: 47 regions and 9 interregional organisations convened to form the Council of the Regions of Europe (CRE).
- By the second General Meeting in Brussels (November 1987) the CRE had been renamed and institutionalised as the Assembly of European Regions (AER), marking its formal commitment to pan‑regional cooperation and long‑term advocacy.
- The founding cohort demonstrates how sub‑national actors can self‑organise across borders to pursue collective interests distinct from national diplomatic channels.

2. Early programme priorities: Eurodyssey and youth mobility (1985)
- In 1985 — the UN International Youth Year — AER launched Eurodyssey, an interregional exchange programme facilitating traineeships, language learning and labour mobility among participating regions.
- Eurodyssey signalled an early strategic priority: regions as actors in human capital development and cross‑border socialisation, not merely administrative units.

3. Reframing political geography: Tabula Regionum Europae (1990)
- In 1990 AER published the Tabula Regionum Europae, a cartographic and conceptual exercise framing Europe through the lens of regions rather than exclusively nation‑states.
- This reframing has normative and policy consequences: it legitimises cross‑border policy instruments, supports regional development strategies and helps consolidate sub‑national identities that can anchor cooperative security and economic practices.

4. Subsidiarity as a cornerstone (1991–1992)
- 1991: AER adopted subsidiarity as a flagship principle — decisions should be taken as close to citizens as possible, with higher levels intervening only when necessary.
- 1992: The principle of subsidiarity — championed by organised regional networks including AER — was incorporated into the Maastricht Treaty, embedding a normative argument for regional participation in EU decision‑making.
- Subsidiarity provided the intellectual bridge between regional advocacy and treaty‑level recognition of sub‑national competencies.

5. Institutional impact and advocacy victories (1994)
- 1994 saw tangible institutional gains aligned with AER’s advocacy:
  - The European Union’s Committee of the Regions (CoR) — an advisory body of regional and local representatives — was established by the Maastricht Treaty to give regions a consultative voice in EU legislation affecting regional competences.
  - Within the Council of Europe framework the Chamber of the Regions was created inside the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, providing a parallel channel for regional representation in a non‑EU pan‑European organisation.
- These institutional outcomes illustrate how persistent networked advocacy can convert normative claims into formal consultative roles.

6. Policy instruments and normative consolidation (1995–1996)
- 1995: AER launched an active campaign to promote regionalism across Europe.
- 1996: Approximately 300 AER members adopted the Declaration on Regionalism in Europe, producing a reference document for emerging or transitioning sub‑national entities seeking recognition and capacity.
- These instruments function both as advocacy tools and as practical guides for capacity‑building among regions.

7. High‑level constitutional engagement (2002) and longer‑term influence
- 2002: AER presented its positions on the “Future of Europe” to the European Convention and contributed to drafting the proposed European Constitution.
- Documented AER proposals that were reflected in constitutional drafts included: recognition of regions as a governance level, extension of subsidiarity to regional/local levels, and inclusion of regional cohesion among EU objectives.
- The European Constitution itself was not ratified; however, much of the institutional and normative terrain influenced later reforms, notably elements incorporated in the Lisbon Treaty (2007). AER therefore demonstrates how organised sub‑national networks can shape high‑level reform debates over time.

8. Youth institutionalisation (2008)
- 2008: AER created the Youth Regional Network, described as Europe’s first platform uniting regional youth councils, parliaments and youth organisations — institutionalising youth participation across regions and embedding generational continuity in regional cooperation.

9. Relevance, impact and analytical synthesis
- AER materially elevated the status of regions within European institutional architecture (subsidiarity in Maastricht; CoR creation).
- The CoR and the Chamber of the Regions offered regions formal advisory/consultative roles — strategic victories for sub‑national governance.
- AER’s programmes (Eurodyssey, Tabula Regionum, Declaration on Regionalism) are tools for identity formation, capacity sharing and policy influence among regions.
- The organisation’s engagement with treaty and constitutional processes shows how networked regional actors can influence supranational constitutionalisation even where outcomes are iterative rather than immediate.
- Continuity in youth engagement (Eurodyssey → Youth Regional Network) demonstrates a long‑term strategy to cultivate human capital and political socialisation at the regional level.

10. Additional clarifications and operational notes (brief)
- Eurodyssey: long‑running traineeship/mobility programme to enhance language skills and employability at regional level.
- Subsidiarity: normative principle that legitimises decentralisation and regional competences when local actions can better achieve objectives.
- Committee of the Regions (CoR): established by Maastricht (1994) as an EU advisory body of regional/local representatives.
- Chamber of the Regions (Council of Europe): represents regional interests inside the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities.
- Tabula Regionum: a conceptual map with practical implications for cross‑border cooperation and regional policy.
- The European Constitution episode underscores the incremental nature of institutional influence: proposals may not materialise immediately, but can reappear in modified forms.

11. Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
While AER is a European organisation in a particular constitutional context, several lessons are directly relevant to India’s strategic culture, federal governance and national security policymaking:

- Recognise sub‑national actors as strategic assets
  - India’s states and union territories possess expertise and responsibilities (border management, disaster response, coastal security, internal policing, economic governance) that can strengthen national resilience if institutionalised voice and coordination are improved.
  - Example: frontline states on international borders (e.g., northeastern states, Jammu & Kashmir, Gujarat) have situational knowledge critical to both security posture and cross‑border stability.

- Apply a subsidiarity mindset to security governance
  - Subsidiarity supports decentralised decision‑making where states are better placed to act — with national agencies providing strategic oversight and coordination. This can accelerate response times and improve local legitimacy in areas such as counter‑insurgency support, pandemic response and sub‑national disaster relief.

- Institutional channels for state input into national foreign/security policy
  - A European model: CoR and regional chambers created consultative mechanisms for regions. India could consider formal consultative mechanisms (regularised councils or advisory forums) enabling state governments to feed regionally specific perspectives into national security, border management and disaster planning without undermining the constitutional prerogative of the Centre over external affairs.
  - Such mechanisms would need constitutional and political calibration (given India’s unitary tendencies in foreign affairs), but can be framed as cooperative federalism to enhance policy efficacy.

- Use regional networks to strengthen cross‑border cooperation
  - Tabula Regionum’s reframing suggests value in thinking territorially across borders. Indian states sharing frontiers with neighbouring countries can develop sub‑national cross‑border cooperation (trade, health, environment, policing) to complement national diplomacy — e.g., India–Bangladesh, India–Bhutan, India–Myanmar border regions.
  - Sub‑national cross‑border engagement can de‑escalate low‑intensity tensions and build local resilience.

- Invest in youth mobility and regional capacity‑building
  - Eurodyssey and AER’s Youth Regional Network show how mobility, exchanges and youth platforms produce long‑term social capital. India should scale similar programmes across states (inter‑state mobility, regional exchanges with neighbouring countries) to build human capital, civic networks and cross‑border familiarity — relevant for societal resilience and soft power.

- Normative instruments matter: declarations and mapping
  - Declarations (like AER’s Declaration on Regionalism) and conceptual tools (Tabula Regionum) create shared frames and policy reference points. India’s federal actors could benefit from inter‑state normative instruments to harmonise disaster protocols, border management standards and cross‑border economic zones.

12. Practical policy recommendations (concise)
- Pilot a federal “Committee of States on External and Border Affairs” to channel state perspectives into national border strategies and to institutionalise information flows during crises.
- Launch a pan‑Indian/state mobility scheme for youth and civil servants modelled on Eurodyssey to build cross‑regional administrative interoperability and social capital.
- Promote sub‑national cross‑border cooperation forums (state‑to‑state) with clear central oversight and legal frameworks to avoid constitutional tensions.
- Commission comparative research mapping AER outcomes to potential Indian analogues (e.g., measure impact on crisis response, cohesion, local economic resilience).

13. Suggested follow‑ups for scholars and policymakers
- Map current AER membership and identify comparable networks in Asia to inform relevant institutional design.
- Track Eurodyssey participation statistics longitudinally to quantify human‑capital impacts.
- Compare specific treaty articles referencing subsidiarity (Maastricht/Lisbon) to potential legislative instruments for India’s cooperative federalism.
- Study outputs and policy influence of the Youth Regional Network for replicable elements in the Indian context.
- Analyse existing Indian state diplomacy practices (trade offices, investment missions) and evaluate scope for formalising consultative security inputs.

Conclusion
AER’s history is a compact demonstration of how organised, persistent regional networks can translate normative claims (subsidiarity, regional recognition) into institutional roles and programmatic gains (mobility, youth networks, consultative bodies). For India — a large, diverse federation facing complex internal and external security challenges — the practical lessons are clear: institutionalise meaningful sub‑national participation, invest in mobility and youth engagement, and design calibrated mechanisms for cooperative federalism that enhance national security and resilience while respecting constitutional boundaries.

## Defining “Region”: The AER Model and Its Relevance to India’s Strategic Culture

Concise definition
- The Assembly of European Regions (AER) defines a “region” as a territorial authority directly below the central government level that has political representation through an elected regional assembly. This formulation — stated “in principle” in the AER statutes — establishes a working, institutional definition grounded in administrative status and democratic representation.

Analytical breakdown of the definition
- Source and legal basis: the formulation derives from the AER statutes and is thus an institutional definition designed to delimit membership and participation in interregional governance networks.
- “In principle”: the caveat signals that the definition is a default rule rather than an absolute taxonomy; it permits pragmatic inclusion of atypical arrangements when necessary.
- Spatial level: a region, as intended here, is situated immediately beneath the national (central) government. It is a subnational tier distinct from municipal or national levels.
- Territorial authority: by specifying a “territorial authority” the AER emphasizes formal administrative boundaries and competencies rather than informal or purely cultural delineations.
- Political representation requirement: democratic legitimacy is central. A qualifying region must have its own institutionalized political representation.
- Form of representation — elected assembly: the required form of representation is an elected regional assembly, not appointed bodies or advisory councils. Election-based legitimacy is a normative criterion.
- Implicit exclusion: bodies lacking elected assemblies (for example, appointed regional administrations, single municipalities acting alone, or purely cultural/historical regions without institutional structures) are generally outside this definition.
- Emphasis on democratic accountability: by making election a condition of recognition, the definition foregrounds accountability and representative legitimacy as prerequisites for interregional engagement.

Additional relevant considerations and comparative perspective
- Practical variation across jurisdictions: what counts as a “region” varies within Europe — federal Länder (e.g., Bavaria), autonomous communities with devolved powers (e.g., Catalonia), and administrative regions approximating EU NUTS2 units in unitary states may all qualify under the AER definition, though they differ markedly in competence and autonomy.
- Exceptions and institutional flexibility: the “in principle” formulation allows the AER to engage with non-standard entities (special-status territories, multi-level metropolitan conglomerates, or devolved islands) where strict application would be impractical for cooperation or representation.
- Alignment with subsidiarity: the definition and the AER’s practice reflect subsidiarity logic — that decisions and cooperation are most legitimate and effective when undertaken at the level closest to those affected, compatible with the delegation of functions by national constitutions.
- Implications for membership and representation: because the definition ties recognition to elected assemblies, AER membership and voting representation are functionally linked to democratic, institutionalized subnational governance. Regions with robust electoral institutions can operate as full participants in interregional policy dialogues.
- Distinction from cultural or historical regions: the AER’s administrative focus excludes informal cultural or historical regions that lack elected institutions; this matters in contexts where identity and administrative reality diverge.
- Interaction with EU classifications: while an AER “region” often corresponds to EU statistical classifications (NUTS), the fit is imperfect. NUTS are designed for statistical and funding purposes and do not always map to politically representative entities; thus AER recognition depends on institutional form, not statistical convenience.
- Relevance for interregional cooperation and policy exchange: regions that meet the AER criteria typically possess competencies (education, transport, economic development, disaster management) that make interregional exchanges substantive — not merely symbolic — for policy learning and operational cooperation.
- Governance and capability implications: elected regional assemblies generally imply administrative capacity and policy autonomy sufficient to implement exchanged practices, absorb cross-border programs, or manage decentralized security-relevant functions (e.g., civil protection).
- Constitutional and legal contingency: the AER definition standardizes institutional level and democratic form but does not harmonize powers. The authority and autonomy of a “region” remain contingent on national constitutions and enabling legislation.
- Practical recommendation for practitioners and scholars: when applying the AER definition — whether to map actors, assess networks, or design cooperative instruments — verify a candidate entity’s national legal status and the existence of an elected regional assembly before treating it as an AER-type region.

Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
- Translating the AER model to the Indian context highlights how subnational democratic institutions (state legislative assemblies, and where relevant, elected bodies in union territories) should be treated as potential international and intergovernmental actors. India’s states routinely possess elected assemblies and significant competences (police in some areas, disaster response, infrastructure), making them analogous to AER-type regions in many functional respects.
- Policy relevance: recognizing subnational elected bodies as legitimate partners expands the channels for cooperation on cross-border and transnational challenges — disaster relief, pandemic response, economic resilience, infrastructure security, and climate adaptation — all of which intersect with national security considerations.
- Constraints and caveats: unlike a European organization defining membership, India’s constitutional framework centralizes foreign policy and national defence. Any subnational external engagement must respect constitutional limits; nevertheless, informal and formal subnational internationalism (sister-state ties, subnational delegations, participation in multilevel networks) has substantive bearing on strategic posture and resilience.
- Operational recommendation: analysts and policymakers should assess subnational actors not only by territorial boundaries but by institutional democratic legitimacy and functional capacity (elected assembly + measurable competencies). When engaging regional actors in policy design or international networks, verify both their legal standing and their delegated powers to ensure meaningful and accountable participation.

Conclusion
- The AER’s working definition of “region” — a territorially-defined subnational authority with an elected assembly — offers a clear institutional criterion that privileges democratic legitimacy and administrative capacity. For scholars of India’s strategic culture and national security, this framing is useful: it identifies which subnational actors can be credible partners in policy networks and highlights both opportunities for decentralized contributions to security-related policy and the legal constraints that national constitutional systems impose. When mapping subnational actors into transnational or interregional frameworks, prioritize verification of elected representation and statutory competencies.

## 6.x The Assembly of European Regions (AER): membership composition, political signalling, and analytical lessons for India

Summary

This section examines a snapshot inventory of the Assembly of European Regions (AER) membership — a pan‑European network of regional authorities — organized by country and listing subnational members (counties, provinces, regions, cantons, oblasts, municipalities and regional associations). The inventory illustrates three interrelated features of contemporary regional networks that are of interest to students of India’s strategic culture and national security policy: (1) the plurality of membership types and administrative scales that regional organizations accommodate; (2) the use of membership decisions as instruments of political signalling (notably the suspension of Russian members after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine); and (3) the operational relevance of such networks for crisis support, reconstruction and normative diffusion (evidenced by strong Ukrainian subnational representation). The list below should be treated as a time‑bound snapshot and cross‑checked against AER’s official registers for current accuracy.

1. What the inventory documents

- The document enumerates AER member regions grouped by country.
- Membership is at the subnational level: counties, provinces, regions, cantons, oblasts, raions, cities, municipalities, autonomous bodies and supra‑local associations appear alongside one another.
- AER’s membership spans EU member states, non‑EU European states, candidate/neighboring countries and the outermost overseas territories of EU states.
- The list reflects an active engagement by Ukrainian subnational actors and contains a distinct note that Russian members were suspended after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

2. The membership snapshot (selected inventory)

Below is the inventory as recorded in the snapshot. It is presented country by country with the unit(s) that hold membership status in AER.

- Albania: Berat County; Dibër County; Durrës County; Elbasan County; Fier County; Gjirokastër County; Korçë County; Kukës County; Lezhë County; Shkodër County; Tirana County; Vlorë County

3. Key analytical observations

a. Plurality of membership types and administrative scales
- AER accepts a heterogeneous mix of members: single cities, raions, provinces/oblasts, federated regions and supra‑local organizations (e.g., unions of municipalities, language‑oriented bodies such as Údarás na Gaeltachta). This heterogeneity permits wide participation but complicates direct comparisons across members because competencies, budgets and populations vary substantially.

b. Geographical reach beyond continental Europe
- Inclusion of outermost regions (Guadeloupe, Martinique, Azores, Madeira) demonstrates that AER’s remit can include non‑continental territories of EU member states. For comparative scholars, this highlights how regional networks blur simple geographical categories and include territorially distant units under shared administrative or political identities.

c. Political signalling and normative posture
- The suspension of Russian members after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine constitutes an explicit political act by a subnational network. This shows that transnational regional organizations are not merely technocratic forums but can exercise normative pressure and align with broader geopolitical coalitions.

d. Active Ukrainian regional engagement
- The relatively large number of Ukrainian subnational actors in AER underscores the role such networks play in providing political support, technical cooperation and multi‑level advocacy for conflict‑affected regions. Regional organizations can thus become channels for reconstruction assistance, capacity building and normative integration during and after crises.

4. Implications for research methodology and policy analysis

- Time‑bound nature of membership: treat the list as a snapshot. Membership can change rapidly (new accessions, suspensions, withdrawals), especially in crisis contexts. Always cross‑check AER’s official register when conducting empirical work.
- Need for normalization: because members represent different administrative levels, employ a normalization schema (e.g., NUTS equivalent, population bands, budgetary capacity, functional competencies) before quantitative comparison.
- Geographical mapping: spatial visualization will aid identification of regional concentrations (e.g., Balkan representation, Ukrainian oblasts) and gaps (where cooperation channels are thin).
- Institutional typology: classify members into types (city, oblast/province, island/separate territory, supra‑local association) to analyze patterns of participation, influence and policy diffusion.

5. Consequences and strategic lessons relevant to India

Although AER is a European body, the features highlighted by this inventory carry transferable lessons for Indian strategic culture and national security policy:

- Subnational diplomacy matters: regional networks empower states’ subnational units to build external ties, attract investment, and mobilize humanitarian or reconstruction support. India’s states and union territories (and their institutions) can similarly use transnational city/region networks to advance economic and strategic interests.
- Normative instruments at subnational level: suspending members (as AER did with Russia) demonstrates that subnational networks can enact normative and political choices that have reputational and practical consequences. India’s policymakers should anticipate and, where useful, harness state‑level diplomacy to signal policy positions (e.g., investor confidence, sanctions compliance, humanitarian commitments) while coordinating with central foreign policy.
- Crisis‑driven engagement: Ukrainian oblasts’ robust presence illustrates how regional networks can provide lifelines during conflict (knowledge transfer, advocacy, reconstruction partnerships). In South Asia, India’s subnational governments might be both beneficiaries and providers in similar cooperative frameworks (disaster relief, economic reconstruction).
- Complexity of multi‑level governance in security analyses: analysts of India’s national security posture should explicitly account for subnational actors’ external engagements, as they can create complementarities or frictions with central strategies (trade diplomacy, strategic partnerships, border management).
- Outermost territories and strategic geography: the inclusion of overseas territories in AER shows how politically connected yet geographically distant regions are treated as strategic assets. India’s island territories (Andaman & Nicobar, Lakshadweep) and coastal states have specific security and diplomatic salience that national strategy must integrate.

6. Recommended next steps for scholars and policymakers

- Verify the membership snapshot against AER’s current membership register and date the snapshot clearly in any analysis.
- Produce a geo‑spatial map of members to visualize regional clusters and strategic gaps.
- Normalize administrative units for any comparative quantitative study (select a consistent unit of analysis).
- Research the procedural and political mechanisms of AER’s suspension of members (criteria, governance process, precedent) to understand how regional bodies operationalize normative decisions.
- For Indian policy: explore institutional arrangements to coordinate subnational external engagement with national foreign policy and security objectives, and consider membership or engagement with comparable transnational regional networks to enhance subnational capacity and strategic reach.

Concluding remark

The AER membership snapshot provides a compact case of how regional networks aggregate diverse subnational actors, exercise political judgment, and become operational partners in times of crisis. For India, the lessons are twofold: (a) subnational actors constitute an increasingly important layer of external engagement that must be woven into strategic thinking; and (b) regional networks can be both instruments of soft power and arenas of normative contestation — capacities that Indian policymakers and scholars should study and, where appropriate, mobilize.

### 6.x Case study: The Assembly of European Regions — list of presidents and lessons for India’s strategic culture

Introduction
- The Assembly of European Regions (AER) is a long-standing transnational forum in which sub‑national governments (regions) across Europe cooperate, lobby, and shape policy at the European level. Although formally distinct from national foreign policy structures, the AER illustrates how regional actors sustain cross‑border networks, exercise external representation, and can imprint priorities on supranational governance. For a book on India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the AER offers a compact empirical window into how sub‑state leadership, institutional design, and leadership rotation shape agenda‑setting in a multilevel polity.

List of presidents (1985–present)
- Edgar Faure — Franche‑Comté (France), 1985–1988  
  - Earliest leader in this list; signals French regional engagement in the early modern phase of AER institutionalization.
- Carlo Bernini — Veneto (Italy), 1988–1992  
  - Late‑1980s Italian regional representation; underscores Italy’s long‑standing regional activism in interregional networks.
- Jordi Pujol — Catalonia (Spain), 1992–1996  
  - High‑profile Catalan figure; an early example of prominent regional politicians using AER visibility to project sub‑national priorities.
- Luc Van den Brande — Flanders (Belgium), 1996–2000  
  - Flemish leadership highlights the relevance of highly autonomous sub‑state entities in multilingual federal settings.
- Liese Prokop — Lower Austria (Austria), 2000–2004  
  - Turn‑of‑the‑millennium presidency bringing Central European regional politics to the fore.
- Riccardo Illy — Friuli‑Venezia‑Giulia (Italy), 2004–2008  
  - Mid‑2000s Italian regional leadership; continuity of Italian influence within AER governance.
- Michèle Sabban — Île‑de‑France (France), 2008–2013  
  - Metropolitan leadership (Paris region) during a period of major European economic and institutional responses; suggests metropolitan priorities (transport, competitiveness, social cohesion) shaping the AER agenda.
- Hande Özsan Bozatlı — Istanbul (Turkey), 2013–2017  
  - Notable for representing a non‑EU/candidate country region; demonstrates AER’s geographic reach beyond EU membership.
- Magnus Berntsson — Västra Götaland (Sweden), 2017–2023  
  - Nordic regional leadership with a six‑year mandate, indicating extended continuity in leadership.
- Albert Castellanos — Catalonia (Spain), 2023–present  
  - Current president (as of 2023); Catalonia’s return to the presidency signals recurring regional influence over decades.

Concise interpretive notes
- Each entry combines the personal stature of the president and the institutional weight of their region: many presidents were or are senior regional political figures whose domestic standing amplified AER’s external voice.
- Term lengths are commonly multi‑year (typically 4–6 years), enabling continuity and sustained policy work rather than purely episodic representation.
- The list demonstrates geographic diversity (Western, Central, Southern Europe and Turkey), repeated representation from certain sub‑state polities (Catalonia, Italy), and the inclusion of metropolitan regions with distinct policy priorities.

Patterns and analytical observations (implications for multilevel governance)
- Geographic distribution: AER leadership rotates among a core set of European regions — France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Sweden — and extends to neighbouring states (Turkey). This illustrates both a concentration of regional influence and an openness to broader European neighbourhood participation.
- Repeated regional representation: Catalonia’s multiple presidencies demonstrate how persistent sub‑national actors can maintain institutional networks over decades, preserving policy continuity and influence.
- Leadership stability: Multi‑year mandates favor strategic programming (e.g., multi‑year projects on cross‑border cooperation, cohesion funding) rather than short‑term symbolic leadership.
- Profile of leaders: The AER presidency is typically held by seasoned regional politicians, linking sub‑national electoral legitimacy to transnational advocacy capacity.
- Inclusion beyond EU: Presence of Turkish regional leadership highlights how interregional forums can function as arenas of soft inclusion — engaging neighbouring or candidate regions even when formal constitutional membership is absent.

Contextualising the AER for India’s strategic culture
- The AER is not a security organisation, but it is a relevant case for studying how sub‑national actors shape external engagement within a multilevel polity. In India, states and union territories increasingly engage in what scholars call “paradiplomacy” — international outreach by sub‑national governments on trade, investment, migration, climate, and cultural diplomacy. The AER shows institutionalized pathways through which such engagement becomes routinized and politically consequential.
- For India’s strategic culture, the AER case highlights three cross‑cutting dynamics:
  1. Decentralized agency: sub‑national actors can sustain external relations and shape policy debates that intersect with national interests (economic security, critical infrastructure, cross‑border mobility).
  2. Institutionalization matters: multi‑year mandates and formalized rotation produce policy continuity and allow regions to develop technical expertise and long‑term projects.
  3. Inclusionary arenas: transregional fora can bridge national exclusions (e.g., non‑EU regions) and provide platforms for neighbourhood engagement that complement or complicate national diplomatic channels.

Practical implications and recommendations for researchers and policymakers (tailored to India)
- For policy analysis: systematically map the tenure of sub‑national leaders (chief ministers, governors) to India’s state‑level external activities and to nationally coordinated security or economic initiatives. Assess whether states with prolonged international activity produce durable policy outputs (as AER presidencies often do).
- For research design: cross‑reference each sub‑national leader’s domestic platform and party affiliation with their external engagement. Ideology, party networks, and economic priorities help explain why certain states prioritize particular international linkages (e.g., technology hubs, diasporic ties, border commerce).
- For practitioners: draw lessons from the AER on designing multilevel coordination mechanisms. India could benefit from clearer protocols that align state paradiplomacy with national security interests (e.g., vetting of foreign MOUs, coordination on critical infrastructure agreements).
- For forecasting policy continuity: track recurring leadership or institutional actors (e.g., repeat chief‑ministerial involvement in specific international networks) to identify likely areas of sustained focus or institutional momentum.
- For archival completeness: when conducting comparative research, verify exact start/end dates, instances of acting/interim chairs, and the timing of congresses or elections that determine mandates. These temporal granularities matter when correlating leadership with policy outputs.

Methodological note
- To evaluate leadership impact, combine qualitative case studies (policy texts, statements, project portfolios) with quantitative indicators (duration of mandate, number of cross‑border initiatives, funding mobilized). For India, analogous indicators include the number of foreign MOUs signed by states, state participation in transnational city/region networks, and degrees of central–state coordination recorded in intergovernmental records.

Concluding reflection
- The AER’s presidency list is more than a roster of names: it is evidence of how sub‑national leaders institutionalize cross‑border engagement, build policy continuity through multi‑year mandates, and expand a region’s external footprint. For India’s strategic culture, these dynamics matter because the increasing internationalization of state governments interacts with questions of national sovereignty, policy coherence, and security. Understanding the AER helps scholars and policymakers anticipate the advantages and frictions that arise when sub‑national actors assume sustained roles on the international stage.
