## The Eastern Partnership (EaP): A Strategic Instrument at the EU’s Eastern Frontier — Relevance for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a targeted regional initiative of the European Union aimed at shaping political‑economic relations with six post‑Soviet states on the EU’s eastern flank. Though primarily an EU policy instrument, the EaP offers lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy in managing neighbouring regions, balancing great‑power competition, and designing differentiated partnership instruments that mix conditionality, capacity building, and geopolitical realism.

### Origins, membership and timeline
- Members/partners: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine.
- Initiators: Project proposed by Poland in cooperation with Sweden; proposal presented to the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council (GAERC) in Brussels on 26 May 2008.
- Official inauguration: 7 May 2009 (Prague).
- First foreign ministers’ meeting: 8 December 2009 (Brussels).

The EaP was launched as a regional strand of the broader European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) to concentrate EU political and technical engagement with its eastern neighbours without offering a guaranteed accession pathway.

### Purpose and principal objectives
The EaP’s declared aims are the construction of a common area of shared values and increased cooperation with partner countries in:
- Democracy and governance;
- Prosperity through trade and economic strategy;
- Stability and security (including energy security);
- People‑to‑people contacts (notably visa facilitation/liberalization).

It is explicitly framed as a framework for association, legal approximation and market integration rather than an accession promise.

### Legal and policy instruments
Key instruments used within the EaP architecture:
- Association Agreements (AAs) and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) — instruments for political association and market integration.
- Other partnership agreements (e.g., Armenia’s Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement — CEPA, 2017).
- ENP financing and sectoral technical assistance; occasional macro‑financial support linked to conditionality.

In practice:
- Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine negotiated and signed AAs with DCFTA elements.
- Armenia selected a CEPA (2017), reflecting its Eurasian Economic Union ties.
- Azerbaijan engaged selectively and resisted a full AA/DCFTA path.
- Belarus’s association process stalled amid strained political relations.

### Institutional architecture and practical mechanisms
The EaP provides a multilateral forum for sustained political dialogue and technical cooperation:
- Regular summits, ministerial meetings and thematic platforms (e.g., democracy & governance; economic integration; energy security; justice & home affairs).
- The Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum to involve non‑state actors and strengthen domestic constituencies for reform.
- Delivery mechanisms: ENP instruments, targeted sectoral programs, and conditional macro‑financial assistance contingent on reforms.

### Geopolitical context and structural challenges
The EaP sits in a strategic space between the EU and Russia. Its efficacy is conditioned by this geopolitical reality:
- Russia’s policies and interventions — ranging from political pressure to military interventions — materially affect partner trajectories and constrain the EU’s options.
- Enduring structural problems among partners: uneven political will, authoritarian backsliding in some states, corruption, weak institutions, and unresolved “frozen” conflicts (Transnistria; Nagorno‑Karabakh; Abkhazia and South Ossetia; Donbas).
- These factors limit the pace and depth of reform and integration despite EU offers of association and market access.

### Tangible outcomes to date
- Visa liberalization/ facilitation notably for Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, enhancing people‑to‑people ties.
- Expanded trade access and regulatory approximation for associated partners, with measurable legal harmonization in many sectors.
- Increased donor activity, technical assistance and institutional linkages between EU institutions and partner administrations.
Yet, gains are uneven and reversible where domestic politics or external pressures undermine reform trajectories.

### Strategic implications — assessment
The EaP is best understood as a pragmatic EU tool to stabilize and reform its eastern neighbourhood through differential engagement: it seeks to advance integration where partner commitment and capacity exist, while offering tailored cooperation elsewhere. Its effectiveness depends on:
- Calibration of conditionality and incentives;
- Sustained resources and coherent EU member‑state coordination;
- Managing geopolitical pushback, especially from Russia.

For an external actor like India, the EaP offers comparative lessons on how a major regional power crafts multi‑layered engagement with proximate states under the shadow of another dominant power.

### Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy — lessons and recommendations
The EaP experience has bearing on Indian policy in several ways:

Policy recommendations (for Indian policymakers):
- Adopt differentiated engagement: offer deeper integration and capacity building where domestic reforms and political will exist, while maintaining flexible, issue‑based partnerships where they do not.
- Link assistance to clear, measurable reform benchmarks but avoid one‑size‑fits‑all conditionality that may alienate potential partners.
- Coordinate with like‑minded partners (including EU member states) to maximize leverage and legitimacy when operating in contested neighbourhoods.

Analytical watchpoints (for analysts):
- Monitor domestic political shifts in partner states as primary determinants of convergence or divergence from reform trajectories.
- Track unresolved conflicts, energy interdependencies, and third‑party interventions as principal risk multipliers.
- Assess how external powers’ strategic competition reshapes partner choices and India’s opportunities for engagement.

Operational guidance (for practitioners):
- Prioritize civil society engagement and institutional capacity building to create durable domestic constituencies for reform.
- Design sectoral programs that are context‑sensitive and capable of producing quick, visible gains to sustain domestic political support.
- Use diplomatic, economic and people‑to‑people tools in tandem; ensure communications emphasize mutual benefits and respect for partners’ strategic autonomy.

Watchpoints (high‑impact risks):
- Escalation of regional conflicts or major power interventions that could abruptly alter strategic calculations.
- Sudden shifts in a partner government’s orientation away from reform/Western engagement.
- Resource shortfalls or EU (or Indian) policy incoherence that undercut long‑term engagement.

### Concluding assessment
The Eastern Partnership illustrates how a regional actor structures layered, normative and material engagement with neighbouring states to promote stability, reform and market integration, while navigating a complex great‑power environment. For India, the EaP is not a template to copy, but a rich source of comparative lessons: the importance of differentiated strategies, institutionalized dialogue platforms, calibrated conditionality, robust civil society links, and the political economy of managing competition with other major powers. These lessons should inform India’s approaches to its own neighbourhood and to partnerships in contested strategic spaces.

## The Eastern Partnership (EaP): Design, Dynamics, and Lessons for Indian Strategic Culture

### Summary and purpose
The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is a distinct "eastern dimension" of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), created to deepen the European Union’s political and economic ties with six post‑Soviet states: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Launched formally in May 2009, the EaP combines bilateral EU‑to‑country engagement with a multilateral forum for cooperation among the partners and the EU. Its stated objectives are to promote stability, security, and prosperity through governance reforms, regulatory alignment and economic integration — while deliberately avoiding any explicit promise of EU accession for partner states.

### Genesis and political context
- Proposal and early diplomacy: The EaP was proposed by Poland and Sweden in May 2008 and discussed at the European Council on 19–20 June 2008 alongside the Union for the Mediterranean. The initiative emerged from a desire by new and eastern EU members to institutionalise closer ties with their eastern neighbours and to complement other EU regional initiatives (notably the Northern Dimension and the Union for the Mediterranean).
- Launch: The EaP was officially launched in May 2009, when the Czech Republic — holding the EU Council presidency — hosted leaders of the six partner countries. Germany’s attendance at the summit signalled broader EU concern about economic and political developments in the Eastern neighbourhood.
- Key dates: May 2008 (proposal); June 2008 (European Council discussion); May 2009 (launch); May 2015 (4th EaP Summit in Riga).

### Membership and geographical scope
- Core partners: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.
- Russia: Explicitly did not participate and criticised the initiative as encroaching on its sphere of influence; the EU rejected that framing, emphasising partner demand and close trade links between the EU and these countries.
- Belarus: The text states Belarus joined as a full member, although in practice its engagement has been uneven and conditioned by EU concerns about governance and human rights.

### Institutional architecture and instruments
- ENP framework: EaP is an instrument within the ENP, thus inheriting the ENP’s mix of incentives (trade, technical cooperation, visa facilitation) and normative aims (rule‑of‑law, governance reforms).
- Dual track:
  - Bilateral track: EU negotiates tailored agreements with individual partners — prominently Association Agreements (AAs) and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), sectoral cooperation, and visa facilitation/liberalisation dialogues.
  - Multilateral track: The EaP provides a forum for summits, ministerial meetings and thematic platforms (governance, energy, connectivity, mobility, economic integration) that allow coordinated regional cooperation and peer learning.
- Administrative design: Unlike the Union for the Mediterranean, the EaP has no independent secretariat. Coordination and implementation responsibilities rest primarily with the European Commission, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and rotating EU presidencies.

### Policy outputs and follow‑through
- Association Agreements and DCFTAs: Several EaP partners — notably Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine — pursued and concluded Association Agreements containing DCFTAs that significantly deepened regulatory and commercial integration with the EU. These agreements moved beyond preferential trade to approximate EU standards across many sectors.
- Mobility and visa policy: The EaP institutionalised visa dialogues and, for some partners, pathways to visa liberalisation contingent on meeting defined benchmarks.
- Thematic cooperation: The multilateral track created regular thematic platforms to address cross‑border challenges (energy security, transport connectivity, anti‑corruption, judicial reform).

### Political reactions and controversies
- Accession ambiguity: The EaP was intentionally silent on formal EU membership. This ambiguity reduced institutional friction within the EU and with Russia but produced divergent expectations within partner societies — some perceived the EaP as a stepping stone to eventual membership, others as limited cooperation.
- Internal EU divisions: Eastern EU members (Poland, the Baltic states) tended to view the EaP as an instrument to prepare partners for possible future accession, while several Western members (notably Germany and France) were cautious, fearing that strong EU engagement could be perceived as "enlargement‑lite" or provocative, particularly in the Ukrainian context.
- Regional institutional overlap: Bulgaria and Romania expressed concern that the EaP might undermine existing Black Sea mechanisms and regional bodies.
- Russia’s stance: Moscow framed the EaP geopolitically, arguing it carved out a new EU sphere of influence; the EU rebutted that the initiative responded to partner demand and reflected the partners’ significant trade ties with the EU.
- Domestic politics in partner states: The level and direction of engagement with the EaP have been strongly conditioned by domestic politics — reformist trajectories inclined towards deeper EU ties, while pro‑Russian orientations led to closer Eurasian integration or selective engagement (exemplified by Armenia’s pivot into the Eurasian Economic Union despite EaP membership).

### Practical constraints and asymmetric engagement
- Belarus: Practical engagement with Belarus has been constrained by EU concerns over human rights and governance; its level of participation has fluctuated.
- Implementation duties: The absence of a dedicated secretariat increased reliance on existing EU bureaucratic capacity (Commission and EEAS) and member‑state initiatives, sometimes producing uneven follow‑up and differential progress across policy areas.
- Geopolitical spillovers: The 2013–2014 Ukraine crisis illustrated how deepening EU‑Ukraine ties (via the AA/DCFTA track) can provoke strong reactions from a neighbouring great power and generate security consequences beyond the economic and normative domains.

### Normative versus strategic objectives
The EaP blends normative aims (governance, rule‑of‑law, civil society support) with strategic interests (economic integration, market access, energy and transport connectivity). This duality is a deliberate design choice but creates tensions when geopolitical considerations or domestic politics interfere with reform trajectories.

### Implications for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although the EaP is an EU instrument tailored to Europe’s neighbourhood, it offers salient lessons for India’s approach to regional engagement and strategic culture:

- Balancing normative aims with strategic priorities: Like the EU, India must decide how far to link governance norms to pragmatic cooperation. The EaP shows that normative conditionality can advance reforms but can also constrain engagement with strategically important partners.
- Managing great‑power sensitivities: The EaP experience underscores the importance of anticipating reactions from neighbouring great powers (e.g., Russia). For India, deeper engagement with South Asian neighbours or Indian Ocean states must account for China and other regional powers’ perceptions and potential responses.
- Institutional design matters: Choices such as whether to create a dedicated secretariat, or to rely on existing bureaucracies, shape implementation effectiveness. India’s regional architectures (SAARC, BIMSTEC, IORA) face similar trade‑offs between formality and flexibility.
- Use of economic instruments: Trade agreements, market access, and mobility facilitation are powerful levers for integration. EaP demonstrates both the integrative potential of deep trade agreements and the political risks they can generate.
- Domestic politics of partners: External frameworks must be resilient to domestic political swings in partner states. India’s assistance and partnership strategies should be calibrated to varying domestic trajectories across neighbours.
- Ambiguity on membership/commitments: The EaP’s deliberate avoidance of accession promises reduced immediate friction but left unmet expectations. For India, clarity about long‑term objectives (e.g., security guarantees, economic integration) helps manage partner expectations and domestic political narratives.
- Multilateral plus bilateral: The EaP’s dual track (country‑specific and multilateral) offers a useful model: combine tailor‑made bilateral arrangements with multilateral platforms for issue‑specific cooperation and norm diffusion.

Conclusion
The Eastern Partnership exemplifies how a regional power (the EU) designs a flexible, layered neighbourhood policy to promote stability, regulatory alignment and economic integration without extending full membership. For Indian strategists, the EaP provides a compact case study in marrying normative ambitions with strategic restraint, managing implementation through existing institutions, and calibrating regional engagement amid competing great‑power influences. These lessons are directly relevant as India refines its own neighbourhood and Indo‑Pacific policies within an evolving geostrategic environment.

### The Eastern Partnership (EaP): Composition, Contested Membership and Strategic Implications

Overview
- The Eastern Partnership (EaP) is an EU policy initiative launched in 2009 to deepen political and economic ties between the European Union and six of its eastern neighbours. Its stated objectives cover democracy and governance, economic integration, mobility and people‑to‑people contacts, and security cooperation.
- Structurally the EaP links 27 EU member states with six Eastern European post‑Soviet states. The EU side comprises the bloc’s 27 member states; the eastern partners are Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus (suspended), Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.

Membership and institutional linkages
- EU participants (27): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden.
- Eastern partners (6): Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus (suspended), Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine.
- Multilateral participation beyond the EaP core: with the notable exception of Belarus, the eastern partners are integrated into Council of Europe structures (human‑rights monitoring, rule‑of‑law instruments) and participate in the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. Euronest is a parliamentary forum that brings together Members of the European Parliament and parliamentarians from the eastern partners to foster closer political and economic cooperation with the EU and to provide a parliamentary dimension to EaP policy.

Belarus: contested participation and suspension
- Belarus’ relationship with the EaP has been politically fraught and episodic. The presence of President Aleksandr Lukashenko at EaP summits (for instance in 2009) provoked debate about including an authoritarian regime within a forum premised on democratic reforms.
- A 2011 episode captured this tension: on 30 September 2011 Belarus was reported to have withdrawn from the initiative, citing “unprecedented discrimination” and an alleged “substitution” of founding principles. On 3 October 2011 Belarus’ Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov publicly refuted the reports of withdrawal.
- The matter was decisively revisited after the 2020 Belarusian presidential election and the subsequent crackdown on dissent. On 28 June 2021 Belarus’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed that Belarus would suspend its membership in the EaP.
- Important legal/diplomatic distinction: the term “suspension” here denotes a pause in Belarus’ engagement with EaP formats and a practical reduction in multilateral cooperation. It is not a formal expulsion enacted by the EU; rather, it reflects deep bilateral tensions and the collapse of the political basis for cooperation in EaP forums.

Differentiated integration among eastern partners
- The EaP is not a uniform framework of identical commitments. Partners have pursued divergent paths of legal and economic integration with the EU:
  - Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia: negotiated and signed Association Agreements including Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), entailing extensive regulatory approximation and market access commitments.
  - Armenia: after deciding to join the Eurasian Economic Union in 2014, the country nonetheless negotiated the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the EU in 2017 — a tailored, less trade‑integrative but politically substantive pact.
  - Azerbaijan: has maintained a more limited contractual relationship with the EU and has not concluded an Association Agreement similar to those of Ukraine, Moldova or Georgia.
- These variations produce differentiated incentives and leverage: the EU’s toolkit is applied selectively, creating a mosaic of commitments within a single political initiative.

Practical implications of Belarus’ suspension
- For Belarus: suspension reduces access to EaP multilateral platforms—political dialogue, parliamentary contacts (including Euronest), and joint technical projects. This reduces the EU’s direct channels of influence and deprives Belarusian actors of multilateral embedding that can foster reform.
- For the EaP and the EU: the absence of Belarus in multilateral EaP forums narrows the space for regional cooperation and removes an instrument of conditional engagement. It also hardens the signal that democratic backsliding and repression carry political costs.
- For other partners: continued participation by the remaining five partners maintains their access to the Council of Europe and Euronest channels and allows the EU to pursue differentiated, often deeper, integration with willing states.

Contextual drivers and the regional environment
- Belarus’ suspension is rooted in longstanding concerns about authoritarian governance under Lukashenko and the severe deterioration of Belarus–EU relations after the 2020 election and post‑election repression.
- External factors—chiefly Russia’s regional influence, overlapping security conflicts (e.g., in Georgia, Nagorno‑Karabakh; Russia–Ukraine war), migration flows and energy interdependencies—shape both EaP cohesion and the scope for EU influence. These dynamics constrain policy options and affect the incentives of partner governments.

Monitoring and prospects for re‑engagement
- Re‑engagement of Belarus with the EaP would likely require either substantive political changes within Belarus (restoration of democratic norms and rights) or a deliberate political decision by Belarusian authorities together with an EU willingness to normalize certain channels. Absent such changes, suspension is likely to persist.
- The EaP’s future effectiveness will depend on (a) the EU’s capacity to calibrate differentiated offers credibly, (b) the domestic politics of the partners, and (c) geopolitical developments, particularly Russia’s posture in the region.

Policy implications and lessons for Indian strategic culture
- Precision in terminology matters: “suspended,” “withdrew,” and “expelled” are distinct concepts with different legal and diplomatic implications. Indian analysts and policymakers should mirror that precision when designing, communicating or evaluating multilateral instruments.
- Differentiation is a practical strategy: the EaP demonstrates how a common framework can accommodate divergent partner ambitions and constraints. For India, which engages on different terms with neighbours and partners, calibrated, bespoke arrangements can preserve engagement while respecting partner heterogeneity.
- Engagement with authoritarian partners is politically fraught and may delegitimize normative agendas if not handled carefully. India’s strategic culture—traditionally favouring non‑interference—can learn from the EaP experience about how to balance principled stands (e.g., on human rights) with pragmatic cooperation.
- Multilateral platforms are instruments of influence: suspension of a partner reduces not only that partner’s benefits but the influencing state’s levers of change. India should weigh the loss of institutional channels when considering measures that may exclude or isolate partners.

Concise summary
- The EaP connects 27 EU member states with six eastern partners—Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus (suspended), Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine—and is designed to deepen democracy, economic integration and security ties. Belarus’ participation has been episodic and politically sensitive; following deterioration in bilateral relations after 2020, Belarus formally suspended its EaP engagement in June 2021. The EaP exhibits differentiated integration (DCFTAs, CEPA, limited agreements) and operates within a contested regional environment shaped by Russian influence and local conflicts. For external actors, including India, the EaP offers lessons on calibrated multilateral engagement, the limits of institutional leverage, and the diplomatic consequences of suspending partners.

Key recommendations for analysts and policymakers
- Treat Belarus’ status as politically sensitive and fluid; interpret “suspension” as a signal of deeper bilateral breakdown, not merely administrative absence.
- Differentiate policy approaches across partners: use bespoke instruments to match partner ambition and constraints.
- Monitor domestic political developments and external influences (Russia, conflicts, energy and migration) as they materially affect EaP outcomes.
- Use precise diplomatic language when conveying membership changes; avoid conflating suspension with formal expulsion.

### Warsaw Summit 2011

The Warsaw Summit of 2011 represents a decisive moment in the European Union’s endeavour to configure a differentiated, value-based yet pragmatic relationship with its eastern neighbourhood. At Warsaw the EU reaffirmed and sharpened the Eastern Partnership (EaP) framework — launched at Prague in 2009 — as the principal vehicle for deepening political, economic and sectoral ties with six post‑Soviet states while attempting to reconcile normative commitments with hard geopolitical imperatives.

Background and purpose
- The Eastern Partnership was presented as a forum to improve political and economic/trade relations between the EU and six named partners: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Warsaw consolidated this orientation and elaborated mechanisms for closer alignment.
- At its core the EaP claims promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The EU draft text at Warsaw underlined shared values: democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, market economy, sustainable development and good governance.
- Functionally, the Partnership was designed to provide the foundation for Association Agreements (AAs) with partners that make sufficient progress on these principles. In practice, AAs frequently include Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs), instruments that create close regulatory and market alignment with the EU.

Institutional model and instruments
- Warsaw indicated that the EaP would borrow lessons from the Balkans’ Stabilisation and Association Process: use of conditionality (reforms in exchange for closer ties), institutional support and a phased accession of obligations. Important caveat: unlike the Balkan process — which contained an explicit membership track — the EaP text left EU membership ambiguous, not explicitly ruled out but not promised.
- The Summit referenced a potential regional free‑trade architecture modelled on CEFTA (Central European Free Trade Agreement); references in some documents to “BAFTA” appear to be misnomers or drafting slips. The practical tools available to the EU under EaP include Association Agreements/DCFTAs, financial assistance (e.g., the European Neighbourhood Instrument), technical assistance, visa facilitation and sectoral cooperation.

Geopolitics, value dilemmas and Belarus
- Warsaw framed the region as of strategic importance: a geopolitical buffer between the EU and Russia, a corridor for energy transit and trade, and a zone where instability can have broader security ramifications for Europe.
- The inclusion of Belarus highlighted a central trade‑off in EU external policy: reconciling a value‑based agenda with geopolitical containment. EU diplomats viewed President Alexander Lukashenko as falling short of the values criterion for full involvement, given his record on human rights and rule of law. Nevertheless, excluding Belarus altogether risked conceding political space to Russia, which could deepen its influence in Minsk.
- As a result, Warsaw signalled calibrated engagement with Belarus: a combination of targeted incentives and sanctions — an attempt to remain principled while hedging geopolitical losses.

Heterogeneous trajectories among partners
- The six partners showed divergent responses to the EaP architecture. Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia later negotiated and signed AAs/DCFTAs, moving toward deep regulatory alignment with the EU. Armenia in 2013 opted into the Eurasian Economic Union, altering its EaP trajectory; Azerbaijan remained cautious and selective in its cooperation. Belarus’s engagement has been heavily constrained by sanctions and its limited appetite for comprehensive reform.
- Domestic political variation, economic structures and external influences (notably Russia, and increasingly China) account for this uneven progress. EU conditionality can be effective but requires sustained monitoring and enforcement; it also depends on the domestic political will of partner states.

Implications and policy recommendations (with relevance to strategic‑culture debates)
- Accept calibrated engagement where necessary. Belarus demonstrates that strict adherence to normative preconditions may sometimes have to be balanced against geopolitical imperatives. Expect a combination of targeted incentives, selective sanctions and calibrated diplomatic outreach where the objective is to prevent exclusive influence by a strategic competitor.
- Use AAs/DCFTAs as leverage, but sustain enforcement. Association Agreements and DCFTAs are powerful instruments of legal and economic socialisation. Their efficacy, however, rests on rigorous monitoring, technical assistance and credible conditionality over time.
- Adapt Balkan models cautiously. The Stabilisation and Association Process offers useful tools (benchmarks, conditionality, institutional assistance) but must be adapted: EaP partners are more heterogeneous, and several do not seek EU membership, so a one‑size‑fits‑all accession template is inappropriate.
- Design tailored integration pathways. The EU should prepare differentiated tracks: a deep‑integration track (AA/DCFTA) for willing partners; selective cooperation for states seeking pragmatic deals; and calibrated engagement with authoritarian regimes, conditioned on measurable reforms.
- Track external actors closely. Russia’s posture — including economic and security levers — can blunt EU conditionality. The presence of other external actors (notably China’s economic outreach) also alters incentives. Any effective neighbourhood policy must monitor and respond to these external influences.
- Communicate membership ambiguity transparently. Leaving membership “not ruled out” may preserve political flexibility, but strategic ambiguity can generate false expectations or resentment. Clear, realistic communication is essential to manage partner expectations and domestic political narratives.

Lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy
Although the EaP is an EU construct aimed at Europe’s neighbourhood, it offers practical lessons for India’s approach to near‑abroad engagement and wider strategic partnerships:
- Balance values and interests: India’s strategic culture, which emphasises strategic autonomy and pragmatic engagement, can benefit from a calibrated model that combines principled stands on governance with realistic geopolitical calculations.
- Tailor engagement to heterogeneity: Indian neighbourhoods and partners vary widely. As with the EaP, designing multiple tracks of cooperation — deep integration where feasible, selective cooperation elsewhere — produces better outcomes than uniform policy instruments.
- Institutionalise conditionality and assistance: Where normative goals are pursued (good governance, rule of law), pairing technical assistance and economic incentives with measurable benchmarks enhances credibility and impact.
- Monitor competing external influences: China, Pakistan and other regional actors can change partner incentives rapidly. India’s policy instruments should therefore incorporate contingency planning and flexible responses.
- Communicate strategy clearly: Ambiguity about long‑term goals (e.g., security guarantees, economic integration) must be managed to avoid strategic miscalculation by partners or competitors.

Conclusion
Warsaw 2011 crystallised the EU’s attempt to construct a value‑driven, but pragmatically adaptable, policy toward its eastern neighbours. The EaP’s mixed outcomes underscore the limits of conditionality when confronted by powerful external actors and diverse domestic politics. For policymakers and strategic‑culture analysts — in India and elsewhere — the Summit provides a compact case study in managing the perennial tension between normative aims and geopolitical exigencies: pursue principled objectives, but design instruments and messaging that are flexible, differentiated and attuned to the regional balance of power.

### Chapter X: The EU’s Eastern Partnership — Objectives, Deliverables and Lessons for Strategic Engagement

Introduction  
The Eastern Partnership (EaP) provides a compact, outcome-driven example of regional external engagement by a major power bloc. Launched to deepen relations between the European Union and six eastern neighbours (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), the EaP was reframed in 2015 at the Riga Summit around a limited, measurable agenda: 20 "deliverables" to produce tangible benefits for citizens by 2020. This section dissects that architecture — its priorities, concrete measures and implementation challenges — and draws targeted lessons for India’s strategic culture and national security policy when designing neighbourhood and regional initiatives.

1. Objectives and Outcome Orientation  
- Primary goal: The EaP’s central objective is political and practical: to deliver discernible improvements in citizens’ lives in partner countries, not merely elite-to-elite diplomatic exchanges.  
- Outcome focus: To translate that ambition into operational policy the EU defined 20 concrete deliverables for 2020 — a compact package of policy reforms, infrastructure works and capacity-building outputs with measurable milestones.  
- Stakeholder design: Deliverables were developed through consultation with partner governments, civil society and other stakeholders to enhance ownership and relevance.

2. The 20 Deliverables — Illustrative Sectors and Measures  
Rather than a long catalogue, the EaP’s deliverables are best understood by sector: they combine infrastructure, regulatory change and social programs.

- Transport and TEN-T integration  
  - Aim: Modernise transport links and integrate or extend sections of the Trans‑European Transport Network (TEN‑T) into partner countries.  
  - Rationale: Integrating infrastructure reduces trade costs, enhances mobility and links markets. TEN‑T is an EU policy instrument that coordinates road, rail, air and waterway corridors across Europe; extending compatible corridors into EaP states lowers barriers to cross‑border trade.

- Energy efficiency and resilience  
  - Aim: Increase political ownership of energy‑efficiency policy at national and local levels and strengthen energy security.  
  - Rationale: Energy‑efficiency reduces dependence on single suppliers, lowers costs and contributes to climate resilience.

- SME finance and local‑currency lending  
  - Aim: Improve access to finance for small and medium enterprises, including encouraging lending in local currencies.  
  - Rationale: Local‑currency loans reduce exchange‑rate risk for businesses, deepen domestic financial markets and stimulate entrepreneurship — essential for broad‑based economic resilience.

- Telecommunications and roaming  
  - Aim: Examine and reduce mobile roaming charges between partner countries (beginning with feasibility studies).  
  - Rationale: Lower roaming costs facilitate business, tourism and personal contacts; a study identifies legal, technical and market barriers before regulatory action.

- Trade facilitation and market access  
  - Aim: Increase trade opportunities both with the EU and intra‑EaP trade via regulatory alignment, standards convergence and logistical improvements.  
  - Rationale: Trade measures are central to economic modernisation and job creation.

- Civil society outreach and social inclusion  
  - Aim: Expand engagement with grassroots civil society organisations to strengthen local ownership and accountability.  
  - Rationale: A robust civil society supports reform sustainability and amplifies citizens’ voices beyond elite circles.

- Youth mobility and people‑to‑people contacts  
  - Aim: Increase mobility, education exchanges, employment support and civic engagement opportunities for youth.  
  - Rationale: Investing in youth builds societal resilience and long‑term ties to Europe.

3. Policy Architecture and Priorities (Riga 2015)  
A joint working paper by the European Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS) organised the deliverables within five priority areas agreed at Riga:

- Stronger governance  
  - Emphasis: Institutional reform, rule of law, public administration reform and anti‑corruption to improve accountability and service delivery.

- Stronger economy  
  - Emphasis: Market access, improving the investment climate, SME support, regulatory convergence and building economic resilience.

- Better connectivity  
  - Emphasis: Transport and energy infrastructure upgrades, environmental and climate considerations, and energy‑efficiency measures to reduce dependency and integrate markets.

- Stronger society  
  - Emphasis: Mobility programs (visas and exchanges), cultural and educational links, and initiatives that increase interpersonal contacts between citizens.

- Involvement of broader society  
  - Emphasis: Mainstreaming gender, improving communications and engaging media, NGOs and local communities in policy processes.

Note on EU instruments: The EEAS coordinates foreign policy and works alongside the Commission to design such external cooperation packages, pairing diplomatic engagement with technical and financial instruments.

4. Implementation: Constraints, Monitoring and Financing  
- Implementation gap risk: Deliverables require sustained political commitment, financing and administrative capacity. Heterogeneity among partner states means variable absorption capacity and reform willingness.  
- Geopolitical constraints: Regional power dynamics — notably Russian influence — and intra‑regional tensions can constrain connectivity and deeper integration projects.  
- Financing needs: Infrastructure components (TEN‑T links, energy projects) need large public and private capital and strong project pipelines; blended finance and de‑risking are essential.  
- Monitoring and measurement: If "tangible results for citizens" are to be credible, each deliverable needs clear indicators, transparent reporting and regular reviews.  
- Uneven benefits and sustainability: Without complementary inclusive policies, gains (e.g., from trade liberalisation) may concentrate in urban centres. Projects must plan for environmental/climate resilience and long‑term maintenance.

5. Civic Engagement and Social Inclusion  
Civil society outreach is both an end and a means: it broadens legitimacy, helps monitor implementation, and fosters local problem‑solving. The EaP’s emphasis on grassroots organisations signals a shift from top‑down external assistance to participatory governance support — an approach that mitigates elite capture and aids localised impact.

6. Practical Recommendations Drawn from the EaP Experience  
For programmes of regional engagement that aim to produce citizen‑level outcomes, the EaP suggests practical lines of action:

- Clear indicators and public reporting: Define timelines and measurable indicators for each deliverable with routine public reporting to build trust.  
- Capacity‑building: Prioritise institutional strengthening to enable partner states to implement reforms and manage funds.  
- Mobilise blended finance: Combine grants, IFI finance and private capital; design de‑risking mechanisms for investors.  
- Civil society engagement: Institutionalise channels for NGOs and local communities to monitor and help implement reforms.  
- Complementary inclusion measures: Pair market‑opening with skills training and regional development to avoid concentrated gains.

7. Relevance and Lessons for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy  
While the EaP is a European instrument, its design and experience offer several actionable lessons for India as it crafts neighbourhood and regional engagement strategies:

- Outcomes over optics: India’s strategic culture has often balanced strategic signalling with programmatic depth. The EaP demonstrates the political leverage of a compact set of measurable deliverables that citizens can perceive — a useful model for India’s initiatives in South Asia, the Bay of Bengal region, and the Indo‑Pacific.  
- Connectivity must be integrated and standards‑aware: Infrastructure programmes are most valuable when linked to interoperable standards and logistics (the TEN‑T parallel). India’s connectivity projects should emphasise technical interoperability, maintenance funding and environmental resilience.  
- Financial instruments matter: Promoting local‑currency lending and financial instruments that reduce exchange‑rate risk can accelerate SME growth in partner states and deepen financial integration — a concrete policy India can incorporate into lines of credit and development assistance.  
- Build institutional capacity, not dependence: Capacity‑building for public administration and procurement increases project sustainability and diminishes dependency. India should prioritise training, transparent procurement support and governance conditionality tailored to local political realities.  
- Civil society as an amplifier: Engaging grassroots organisations broadens legitimacy and provides local monitoring. India’s use of soft power (educational exchanges, cultural ties, technical cooperation) can be made more effective through intentional civil society partnerships.  
- Prepare for geopolitical pushback: Like the EaP, Indian initiatives operate in contested spaces. Anticipating geopolitical friction, designing low‑escalation confidence‑building measures and coordinating multilaterally can mitigate risk.  
- Measure and communicate impact: Regular, transparent reporting on outcomes strengthens domestic and partner‑country political support — and aligns with democratic accountability norms that are central to India’s soft power narrative.

Conclusion  
The EaP’s 2015 reorientation toward a compact, deliverable‑based approach illustrates how a major actor can shift from programmatic breadth to focused, citizen‑visible outcomes. For India, which is increasingly active in regional diplomacy and development, the EaP offers a usable template: define limited, measurable goals; pair infrastructure and regulatory measures with capacity‑building and civil society engagement; mobilise blended finance; and explicitly prepare for geopolitical friction. These elements align with a strategic culture that seeks influence through tangible public goods rather than solely through military or rhetorical power — a mode of engagement that advances both national security and regional stability.

## Financing

The financial architecture that underpinned the Eastern Partnership (EaP) during the early 2010s is instructive both as a case of how a major regional actor uses money to pursue strategic objectives and as a lesson for other states (including India) about how financing choices shape influence, reform trajectories and stability in neighbouring regions.

Summary figures
- For 2010–2013 the European Commission (EC) earmarked €600 million for the six EaP partners under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI).
- That €600 million represented roughly one quarter of the total funding available to EaP countries in that period, implying a total EaP-related funding envelope of approximately €2.4 billion for 2010–2013.
- The €600 million was distributed across three principal purposes:
  - Comprehensive institution-building programmes to support reforms: ~€175 million (≈29.2% of €600m).
  - Pilot regional development programmes to tackle sub‑national economic and social disparities: ~€75 million (≈12.5%).
  - Implementation of the Eastern Partnership priorities (democracy, governance, stability, economic integration with EU policies, energy security, people‑to‑people contacts): ~€350 million (≈58.3%).

EIB technical assistance and the EPTATF
- In December 2010 the European Investment Bank (EIB) established the Eastern Partnership Technical Assistance Trust Fund (EPTATF).
- The EPTATF performs characteristic EIB functions: financing project preparation, providing technical assistance and capacity building to increase project bankability and implementation capacity.
- The Trust Fund also ran an Eastern Partnership Internship Programme aimed at strengthening human capital and networks; the programme was open to nationals of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Belarus is not listed among eligible countries in the typical descriptions of this programme — a detail that merits checking as it may reflect deliberate policy choices linked to political relations or operational constraints.

Later aid — the 2021 package (selected figures)
- In 2021 the EU provided a new aid package to the six EaP countries; the document under review lists at least three allocations:
  - Ukraine: €1.9 billion
  - Azerbaijan: €140 million
  - Armenia: €2.6 billion
- The subtotal for these three countries is €4.64 billion. (This is only a partial aggregate because amounts for the remaining EaP partners are not provided in the source excerpt.)
- The Armenian allocation in 2021 was reported as 62% higher than a previously promised figure; back-calculating gives the earlier promise at roughly €1.6 billion (2.6 / 1.62 ≈ 1.605 billion).

Context and analytical observations
- ENPI background: The European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument was the EC’s principal financing tool for neighbourhood policy at that time (later succeeded by other instruments). The ENPI-era allocations reveal EU priorities in the immediate post‑2009 EaP design phase.
- Priority signalling: The largest share of the 2010–2013 envelope (~58%) was directed to “implementation” of EaP objectives — an explicit prioritisation of political and economic alignment, governance and stability over smaller pilot regional development programmes or exclusively technical institution‑building. This allocation mix is a political choice as much as a technical one.
- Role of trust funds: The EIB’s EPTATF is typical of how Europe pairs grant financing and technical assistance with investment finance — the two instruments are complementary: grants and TA prepare and de-risk projects which the EIB and commercial financiers can then fund.
- Human-capital leverage: Internships and TA programmes are strategic instruments: they foster pro‑EU expertise and networks in partner societies, generating long‑term influence through people-to-people ties and administrative capacities.
- Political exclusions: The omission of Belarus from the listed internship eligibility is notable. Such exclusions often reflect shifts in bilateral relations and can be both an instrument and a signal of conditionality.
- Scale and crisis dynamics: The 2021 headline numbers (particularly for Armenia and Ukraine) are far larger than the ENPI-era €600m earmark, indicating either new crisis‑response packages, different financing instruments, or broader, country‑specific commitments (and, implicitly, changing geopolitical priorities and urgency).
- Implementation caveats: Large financial pledges are necessary but not sufficient for outcomes; results depend on absorptive capacity, anti‑corruption frameworks, monitoring and evaluation, and donor coordination.

Implications for strategic influence (brief note for Indian readers)
- Financing choices reveal what a donor prioritises: governance reforms, economic convergence, energy security or human capital. For India’s strategic culture — which prizes long‑term relationship building and capacity cooperation — the EaP case underlines how targeted technical assistance and people‑to‑people programmes can complement larger investment and diplomatic engagement.
- Conditionality and credibility: EU packages typically come with performance expectations. For India, which generally prefers less‑conditional engagement, the EaP model shows both the leverage that conditionality can yield and the political costs when conditionality excludes actors (e.g., Belarus).
- Energy security and regional stability: The clear allocation to energy security under EaP funding is relevant for states for whom neighbouring energy routes and supplies are strategic. India should note that financial packages can be used to underwrite diversification and resilience projects with strategic payoffs.
- Coordination and coherence: Multiple instruments (EC grants, EIB trust funds, bilateral aid) must be coordinated to avoid fragmentation and to maximise leverage — a lesson applicable to any state expanding its external financing toolkit.

Recommendations and questions for further inquiry
- Verify the full breakdown of the 2021 package across all six EaP countries (Georgia, Moldova, Belarus figures are missing in the excerpt) to understand the distributional rationale and whether the larger sums are crisis responses or long‑term commitments.
- Confirm whether Belarus was indeed excluded from EPTATF internship eligibility by policy design, and if so, document the political and operational reasons.
- Examine the monitoring and evaluation frameworks attached to the €600m (2010–2013) and to the 2021 allocations to assess outcomes and value‑for‑money.
- Assess coordination mechanisms between EC instruments (ENPI/its successors), EIB trust funds and other donors active in the region to identify duplication risks and potential gains from pooled financing or delegated cooperation.
- Analyse absorptive capacity and governance constraints in each partner country to determine how effectively pledged funds could be converted into durable institutional and socio‑economic gains.
- Trace the energy‑security component in project-level detail: what kinds of diversification, infrastructure or institutional projects were financed, and with what geopolitical consequences?

Concluding remark
The EaP financing architecture demonstrates how external money is marshalled to pursue a mix of political, economic and security goals. For scholars and practitioners interested in strategic culture and national security — including Indian policymakers considering how to shape influence in adjacent regions — the case underlines the necessity of pairing money with technical capacity, credible engagement, and careful calibration of conditionality to local capacities and political realities.

### Euronest Parliamentary Assembly — institutional profile and lessons for strategic practitioners

Context and placement
- Euronest Parliamentary Assembly (Euronest) was created in 2011 as the parliamentary pillar of the European Union’s Eastern Partnership (EaP) initiative. The EaP itself (launched in 2009) is an EU policy framework for deepening ties with six eastern neighbours: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Euronest is therefore best understood as a diplomatic‑parliamentary instrument designed to bring legislators from the European Parliament and participating EaP national parliaments into sustained dialogue.

Establishment and stated purpose
- Purpose: to forge closer political and economic ties between the EU and EaP partners and to promote approximation to EU norms — notably rule of law, human rights, democratic governance and economic reform.
- Year of establishment: 2011, within the broader EaP architecture as its inter‑parliamentary forum.

Composition, meeting practice and participation dynamics
- Membership: delegations from the European Parliament and from those EaP national parliaments that opt to participate. In practice Belarus has been largely excluded from many EaP/EU formats because of political conditions and lack of engagement with EU reform benchmarks.
- Meeting rhythm and venues: Euronest holds an annual plenary. Meeting locations alternate between an EaP country and one of the European Parliament’s workplaces (Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg). The annual plenary is supplemented by committee meetings and bilateral parliamentary exchanges throughout the year — it is the standing, technical work that produces most of Euronest’s substantive output.

Functions, outputs and mechanisms of influence
- Main functions: facilitate parliamentary dialogue; issue joint declarations and recommendations; run working groups (for instance on democracy, energy, trade); and provide a forum for parliamentary cooperation and monitoring of reforms.
- Outputs: joint declarations, committee reports, recommendations to the EU and partner governments, and thematic resolutions that set normative and political expectations.
- Instrumental character: Euronest is a normative and diplomatic mechanism — it socialises EaP legislatures to EU standards, creates channels for parliamentary pressure for reforms, and amplifies commitments publicly. It does not, however, wield legislative authority in the EU enlargement process and cannot unilaterally change accession outcomes.

Limitations and practical constraints
- Influence is conditional: Euronest’s effectiveness depends on political will both in participating EaP states and within the European Parliament. It is a soft‑power instrument whose leverage is limited where domestic political actors resist reform or where executive‑level diplomacy diverges from parliamentary signals.
- Structural limits: it cannot resolve bilateral interstate disputes among partners nor impose conditions; it cannot substitute for executive negotiation in accession or association agreements.
- Selective engagement: varying political trajectories across EaP states (e.g., Ukraine and Moldova’s more advanced accession track versus Belarus’s near‑disconnection) mean that Euronest’s relevance and intensity of cooperation vary considerably by country and over time.

Interpretation of the appended “map legend” fragment
- The fragment in the source — a short list headed “Countries that could join the European Union” followed by categories such as “Current members”, “Candidate countries”, “Applicant / potential candidate countries”, “Membership possible”, “Membership not possible” — reads as a legend intended for mapping or status classification, not as substantive description of Euronest itself.
- Purpose of that legend: a convenient taxonomy for enlargement or status tables used alongside institutional descriptions. It underscores that the text from which the Euronest excerpt was drawn mixes institutional description with broader enlargement/status material.

Relevance to India’s strategic culture and national security policy (analytical points)
- Parliamentary diplomacy as an instrument: Euronest demonstrates how parliament‑level forums can be institutionalised to promote norms, monitor reforms and signal political support. For India, where strategic outreach to neighbouring states and regional groupings is central, parliamentary channels can complement executive diplomacy by extending dialogue, enhancing transparency and mobilising public normative commitments.
- Norm diffusion and capacity building: Euronest acts mainly through persuasion, information exchange and capacity‑building rather than coercion. India can draw lessons on how legislative engagement supports legal‑institutional reform agendas in partner states without promising immediate political outcomes.
- Managing asymmetry: the EU–EaP relationship exemplifies asymmetrical influence — a powerful regional actor using normative instruments to shape neighbour behaviour. India operates in a different regional context but can benefit from carefully calibrated, non‑binding parliamentary mechanisms to avoid perceptions of domination while promoting convergence on governance or security norms.
- Limits of parliamentary instruments: Euronest’s modest direct impact on accession underscores a general lesson: parliamentary forums are valuable for signalling and norm promotion but are weak as instruments for enforceable commitments. Indian policymakers should therefore integrate parliamentary diplomacy into a wider policy mix (economic incentives, executive negotiation, security cooperation) rather than treating it as a stand‑alone lever.
- Strategic messaging and domestic audience: parliamentary statements and joint declarations can be used to communicate intent both domestically and to external audiences. For India, intra‑parliamentary engagement with neighbours can help build domestic political consensus around foreign policy choices and demonstrate credibility to partners.

Operational and monitoring recommendations for scholars and practitioners
- Track Euronest outputs (joint declarations, committee reports, lists of participating delegations) to read shifts in political commitment and parliamentary pressure for closer EU links.
- Analyze follow‑up: examine whether Euronest recommendations translate into legislative initiatives in partner parliaments or into changes in executive policy; this clarifies where parliamentary influence is substantive versus symbolic.
- Use Euronest as a comparative case when designing parliamentary diplomacy: assess which components (annual plenary, technical committees, bilateral exchanges) produce measurable outcomes and which are primarily signalling tools.

Concluding reading point
- Euronest is a paradigmatic case of an inter‑parliamentary instrument designed to steer neighbour states toward a regional actor’s norms through dialogue, monitoring and public commitment. For analysts of India’s strategic culture, it offers a compact example of how parliamentary mechanisms can be harnessed in external policy — their strengths as norm entrepreneurs and their limits where material incentives or executive diplomacy are decisive.

### Prospect of EU Membership (Eastern Partnership)

Context and summary
- The Eastern Partnership (EaP) brings together six post-Soviet states — Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine — with the European Union in a multilateral framework intended to deepen political association and economic integration. Engagement intensity varies by country and is shaped by domestic politics, unresolved territorial conflicts, and competing external ties (notably with Russia).
- Two parliamentary developments at the end of the 2010s — a unanimous Euronest Parliamentary Assembly resolution in December 2019 and a European Parliament motion in June 2020 — signalled stronger parliamentary-level political support in Europe for an opened door toward closer EU–EaP integration. These are important political signals but not substitutes for formal enlargement procedures.

Key parliamentary milestones
- December 2019 — Euronest Parliamentary Assembly (after its 8th meeting) adopted a resolution setting a range of EU‑integration goals to be achieved by 2030. The resolution explicitly affirmed that the enlargement process is open to EaP states and framed a 2030 horizon as an aspirational target for deeper integration.
  - Note: Euronest is a parliamentary forum linking Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) and EaP parliamentarians. Its resolutions are politically significant for agenda‑setting and signalling, but are not legally binding on the EU or its member states.
- June 2020 — The European Parliament adopted a motion proposing the creation of a common economic space between the EU and the six EaP countries, presenting that proposal as part of a process of gradual integration. The motion passed comfortably: 507 in favour, 119 against and 37 abstentions.
  - Interpretation: The vote demonstrates broad parliamentary support for stronger economic links with EaP states while also showing a meaningful minority of caution or opposition among MEPs.

Legal and institutional limits of parliamentary signals
- European Parliament resolutions and Euronest positions are influential political instruments: they shape public debate, encourage Commission and member‑state action, and help create momentum. They do not, however, alter the EU’s treaty obligations or unilaterally open accession negotiations.
- Formal accession requires the procedures set out in the EU treaties: an application, the European Commission’s assessment (opinion), candidate status, the opening and sequential negotiation of chapters of the acquis, and the unanimous agreement of EU member states to admit a new member. The 2030 date in the 2019 Euronest resolution is therefore an aspirational target rather than a guaranteed timetable.

Meaning of a “common economic space”
- In policy usage a “common economic space” denotes deeper economic integration short of full membership. Elements can include intensified trade liberalisation, regulatory convergence with the EU acquis, increased market access for goods and services, and facilitation of capital and labour mobility.
- Practical templates already exist within the EaP: Association Agreements and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) (notably with Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia) represent stages of regulatory alignment and market integration that approach parts of a common economic space.
- A common economic space would most likely be implemented incrementally, with conditionality tied to domestic reforms and technical harmonisation rather than through an immediate legal extension of EU membership rights.

Principal obstacles to accession prospects
- Democratic and governance reform requirements: meeting the Copenhagen political criteria — stable institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for minorities — remains a core precondition, and substantial variation exists across the six EaP states.
- Territorial conflicts and frozen or active conflicts: Nagorno‑Karabakh, eastern Ukraine (Donbas), Abkhazia and South Ossetia create acute security and legal problems that complicate enlargement calculations.
- Geo‑economic and security ties with Russia: energy interdependence and defence politics are major constraints on how far some EaP states can pivot toward the EU without provoking regional tensions.
- Member‑state political will and unanimity: enlargement is not only a technical process but a political decision requiring the consent of all member states; public opinion, migration concerns and geopolitical calculations in existing members shape that consent.

Country differentiation within the EaP
- Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia represent the clearest cases of committed EU integration via Association Agreements and DCFTAs; their domestic reform trajectories and public orientations toward the EU are comparatively advanced.
- Armenia, Azerbaijan and Belarus have different geopolitical orientations and constraints (Armenia’s membership in the Eurasian Economic Union for a period; Azerbaijan’s energy diplomacy and domestic governance; Belarus’s close security ties with Russia), which shape more ambiguous or constrained EU‑oriented pathways.

Actors and processes that matter
- Parliamentary actors: Euronest and the European Parliament play important agenda‑setting roles and can press the institutional debate.
- Executive and treaty actors: any durable shift requires action by the European Commission (opinion and proposals), the European Council (member‑state political consent) and the EU institutions that administer neighbourhood and enlargement policy.
- EaP states themselves must implement conditional reforms, manage conflict dynamics, and decide the depth of their EU orientation.

Implications and practical recommendations
- Parliamentary momentum is politically valuable but insufficient: stakeholders should watch for follow‑through by the European Commission and member states — e.g., concrete proposals for economic frameworks, funding programs, pre‑accession instruments or roadmaps.
- Gradualism and conditionality are the likeliest path: effective progress will combine staged economic measures (trade, regulatory alignment), clear reform benchmarks (rule of law, anti‑corruption, democratic norms), and technical assistance.
- Tailor pathways to national realities: policy packages should be country‑specific, accounting for conflicts, existing economic ties (including membership in other economic unions), and domestic reform capacity.
- Track formal milestones for membership prospects: candidature requests, Commission opinions, opening of negotiation chapters, and visible unanimity among member states are the hard indicators of a genuine accession trajectory.

Relevance for India’s strategic considerations
- European enlargement dynamics in Eastern Europe shed light on broader great‑power interplay in Eurasia. India’s strategic community should observe how the EU balances normative attraction and realpolitik constraints when engaging contested neighbourhoods.
- A deeper EU–EaP economic space could shift regional markets and energy routes; India’s energy diplomacy and trade policies in the Eurasian littoral should parallel such shifts to preserve access and diversify partnerships.
- The EaP experience illustrates how conditionality, phased integration and differentiated partnerships can be employed where full membership is politically or legally infeasible — useful models when India designs its own neighbourhood and partnership instruments in South Asia and the Indian Ocean region.
- Finally, the political signalling function of parliamentary resolutions — strong rhetoric that nonetheless requires executive follow‑through — is a reminder that formal pronouncements must be evaluated against institutional capacities and member‑state political will when assessing geopolitical change.

Concise concluding assessment
Parliamentary resolutions in 2019–2020 reaffirmed a political openness in Europe toward deeper EaP integration and proposed mechanisms (like a common economic space) for stepwise convergence with the EU. In practice, however, legal realities, geopolitical constraints, unresolved conflicts and the need for unanimous member‑state decisions make rapid accession unlikely. The most plausible path remains conditional, incremental integration — combining DCFTA‑style regulatory alignment with targeted reforms and country‑tailored roadmaps — a pattern that offers useful analogies for India’s strategic policymaking in its own neighbourhood.

### EU–Ukraine Bilateral Relations (Eastern Partnership)

Context and significance  
The EU–Ukraine relationship during the early Eastern Partnership (EaP) period illustrates the tensions between multilateral frameworks and national ambitions for deep integration with the EU. Public mobilisation in Ukraine — most visibly the pro‑EU demonstrations of 27 November 2013 (Euromaidan) — signalled powerful domestic demand for European political and economic association and reshaped the trajectory of bilateral relations. For analysts of strategic culture and national security, the case shows how external partnership architectures interact with domestic politics, bilateral initiatives and geopolitical competition.

1. The Eastern Partnership and Ukraine’s posture
- The Eastern Partnership (EaP) was launched as a differentiated, multilateral framework for Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. It explicitly avoided promising EU membership, instead offering enhanced cooperation across politics, trade, justice, mobility and sectoral policy.  
- Kyiv’s official posture was ambivalent. Ukrainian leaders and officials publicly questioned the “added value” of EaP for Ukraine because EaP documents (e.g. European Council Declaration, May 2009) did not commit to the full political or economic integration Ukraine sought, nor to visa‑liberalisation as a stated outcome.  
- Nonetheless, some Ukrainian officials welcomed EaP pragmatically. Deputy Prime Minister Hryhoriy Nemyria described it as a route to modernisation, noting that in practice EaP employed instruments similar to those used with EU candidates.

2. Parallel bilateral and sectoral negotiations
- Separate from the EaP multilateral track, the EU and Ukraine negotiated an Association Agreement (AA) including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA). These bilateral instruments were the primary vehicles for Ukraine’s strategic objective of close political and economic integration with the EU.  
- Visa liberalisation was negotiated along a parallel, conditional track. Although partial progress occurred, divergent visa policies and practices among EU member states complicated and slowed universal liberalisation for Ukrainians.

3. Public mobilisation and its effects
- The 27 November 2013 pro‑EU demonstrations in Kyiv signalled a turning point. Triggered by the then‑government’s suspension of the Association Agreement signature, the protests (Euromaidan) underscored how domestic politics can accelerate or redirect international engagement. The mobilisations helped precipitate major political change in Kyiv and catalysed a more rapid rapprochement with the EU.

4. Concrete bilateral measures with immediate impact
- Subregional, bilateral measures often deliver tangible benefits more quickly than multilateral frameworks. A prominent example: Poland and Ukraine agreed to replace visas with simplified local border permits for residents living within 30 km of the border.  
  - Scope and timing: up to 1.5 million people could benefit; the scheme entered into force on 1 July 2009.  
  - Practical value: such arrangements eased cross‑border movement, trade and social ties immediately, providing visible gains while broader negotiations continued.

5. Subsequent milestones (after the EaP initial phase)
- Association Agreement: signed 21 March 2014.  
- DCFTA provisional application: from 1 January 2016; full entry into force on 1 September 2017.  
- Visa liberalisation: the EU granted visa‑free short‑stay travel to Schengen states for Ukrainian citizens with biometric passports on 11 June 2017 (up to 90 days within any 180‑day period).

6. Constraints on deeper integration
- Three interlocking constraints shaped the pace and depth of EU–Ukraine integration:  
  1. EU internal divergence on enlargement and migration policy among member states;  
  2. Ukraine’s domestic governance deficits (corruption, judiciary and rule‑of‑law weaknesses) that triggered conditionality and reform demands;  
  3. External pressure, notably sustained Russian opposition to Kyiv’s westward integration.  
- These constraints meant EaP alone could not substitute for a clear accession perspective or guarantee rapid liberalisation.

7. Strategic importance for the EU
- A reformed, stable and economically integrated Ukraine is a strategic priority for the EU. Benefits include deepened trade relations, secure energy transit routes, and enhanced regional security. Consequently, the EU’s instruments — both multilateral and bilateral — sought to balance incentives, conditionality and geopolitical signalling.

8. Operational implications and lessons learned
- EaP can be effective if its instruments are coupled with: clear conditionalities (rule‑of‑law, anti‑corruption), sequencing (governance → trade → mobility), coherent member‑state policies, and sustained political backing from Brussels and capitals.  
- Bilateral and subregional mobility schemes (like Poland–Ukraine) show how targeted measures can produce immediate social and economic relief even where multilateral commitments are limited.  
- Public mobilisation matters: domestic popular politics can accelerate integration and alter the calculus of external partners.

9. Recommendations for analysts and policymakers (applicable to EU partners and of interest to other states, including India)
- Track implementation timelines: association agreements, DCFTA provisions, and visa liberalisation benchmarks to assess real integration progress.  
- Monitor delivery on domestic reforms in partner countries — rule‑of‑law, anti‑corruption and judicial reform — as they are the primary conditional variables for deeper cooperation.  
- Leverage bilateral/subregional policy instruments to generate early, visible benefits (mobility schemes, local trade facilitation) while multilateral frameworks mature.  
- Ensure coherence among partners: divergent positions within a multilateral group weaken leverage and slow outcomes.  
- Recognise the catalytic role of domestic politics: public opinion and mobilisation can reshape external engagements rapidly; external strategies must be politically adaptive.

10. Key implications (concise)
- EaP acted largely as a stopgap multilateral framework; it did not replace Ukraine’s strategic pursuit of EU integration.  
- Bilateral measures are politically salient and can deliver tangible benefits more quickly than multilateral instruments.  
- Domestic mobilisation (Euromaidan) demonstrates that internal political dynamics are often decisive for external alignment.

Relevance for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
Although geographically distinct, the EU–Ukraine experience offers transferable lessons for India’s external partnerships and neighbourhood policy: the effectiveness of combining multilateral frameworks with concrete bilateral measures; the importance of sequencing conditionality and economic incentives; the need for coherence among partners; and the centrality of domestic governance and public sentiment in shaping foreign policy outcomes. For Indian strategists, the case underlines that durable external integration and security cooperation rest on both credible incentives and robust domestic reform trajectories.

## Chapter X: The Eastern Partnership as a Case Study in Great‑Power Competition — Implications for India’s Strategic Culture and National Security Policy

Concise summary  
The Eastern Partnership (EaP) episode—Russia’s persistent opposition and the EU’s insistence on partner choice—illustrates how great powers contest influence in a shared neighbourhood by competing narratives of sovereignty, legitimacy, and security. Between 2009 and 2015 the interaction produced high‑profile rhetoric (from Sergei Lavrov, Dmitry Medvedev, Vladimir Putin on the Russian side; to Carl Bildt, Donald Tusk, Angela Merkel, Alexander Stubb on the EU side), tactical ambiguity from Moscow, and a steady EU emphasis on voluntary partnership and international law. For students of India’s strategic culture this episode is instructive: it shows how external offer structures (economic, normative, security) interact with domestic vulnerabilities, how frozen conflicts are instrumentalised, and how a middle power (the EU) and a regional hegemon (Russia) signal and shape behaviour in their shared hinterland.

Background: what the EaP is and who the actors were  
- The Eastern Partnership (launched 2009) is an EU initiative co‑authored by Poland and Sweden to deepen ties with six eastern neighbours: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. It is an association and cooperation framework — not a membership pathway — offering political association, regulatory approximation and selective economic integration (e.g., Association Agreements; for some partners, Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas).  
- Major actors in the episode: the Russian Federation (presidents Medvedev and Putin; Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov), EU institutions and member states (notably Sweden and Poland as initiators), and leading EU officials (Carl Bildt, Donald Tusk, Angela Merkel, Alexander Stubb). The six EaP countries were the immediate objects of competition; contested territories (Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, Donbas, Nagorno‑Karabakh) provided leverage points.

How Russia framed and acted (core themes)  
- Sphere of influence: Moscow portrayed the EaP as an external encroachment into the post‑Soviet space, a move to expand EU influence at Russia’s expense.  
- Sovereignty and coercion claims: Russian FM Sergei Lavrov questioned whether the EU’s approach “promotes democracy or is it blackmail?”, arguing that EaP instruments could pull states away from decisions they would make as sovereign actors.  
- Tactical ambiguity: Kremlin messaging oscillated—Medvedev publicly dismissed the EaP as “useless” (Nov 2009), yet Lavrov soon suggested Russia might not rule out participation, signaling conditional openness designed to shape outcomes.  
- Leverage in practice: Moscow employed economic tools (energy supplies, trade measures), diplomatic pressure (recognition politics around Abkhazia/South Ossetia), and security influence to deter deeper EU alignment.

How the EU and partner states responded (core themes)  
- Voluntarism and law: Co‑authors Sweden and Poland, and other EU leaders, repeatedly framed EaP participation as voluntary. Swedish FM Carl Bildt rejected Lavrov’s characterisation as “completely unacceptable,” stressing that partner states “chose to join.” EU leaders anchored their position in principles and international law rather than coercion.  
- Defending choice: In 2015 European Council President Donald Tusk accused Russia of “destructive, aggressive and bullying tactics,” while Angela Merkel and Alexander Stubb reiterated that the EU accepts partner states’ rights to choose different integration trajectories.  
- Incentives and limits: The EU’s toolkit combined normative appeal and market access (e.g., DCFTAs) with financial assistance, but the Union’s internal cohesion and economic difficulties were vulnerabilities that Russian messaging exploited.

Key episodes and timeline (2009–2015)  
- 2009: Launch of the EaP. November 2009—President Medvedev calls the EaP “useless”; Foreign Minister Lavrov later signals Russia would not necessarily rule out joining, illustrating mixed messaging.  
- 2011 (Warsaw EaP Summit): Vladimir Putin argues Ukraine is unlikely to join the EU given Europe’s economic crisis and proposes deeper Russia–Ukraine economic ties as an alternative.  
- 2013–14 (subsequent context): The Ukraine crisis (not detailed in the immediate outline) then dramatically escalated confrontation over EaP choices.  
- 2015 (May): EU leaders publicly intensify criticism of Russian tactics; Tusk, Merkel and Stubb reassert the sovereignty of partner states in choosing their “clubs.”

Additional context and mechanisms at work  
- EaP instruments: Association Agreements and DCFTAs provided concrete pathways for regulatory alignment and market access for some partners (not EU membership). These instruments matter because they carry tangible economic and legal commitments that alter partners’ orientation.  
- Frozen conflicts as leverage: Breakaway regions (Donbas, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Transnistria, Nagorno‑Karabakh) both complicate states’ choices and are used instrumentally by outside actors to shape outcomes and raise transaction costs of alignment.  
- Competing legitimacy claims: The EU justified engagement through sovereignty, rule of law and choice; Russia claimed historical ties, security interests and resistance to external encroachment. Both sides spoke to domestic and international audiences—rhetoric often had a performative, tactical dimension.  
- Russian tactics beyond rhetoric: Economic coercion (energy cutoffs, trade barriers), security posturing, and political influence operations have been deployed variably by Moscow to retain leverage.  
- EU vulnerabilities: The attractiveness of EU offers depends on internal cohesion and economic strength—conditions that Russia sought to exploit in its messaging.

Strategic implications — analytic takeaways for India’s strategic culture and national security policy  
- The power of sovereignty discourse: Competing great powers invoke “sovereignty” to legitimise opposite courses of action. For India—whose strategic culture emphasises autonomy and non‑interference—this underlines the importance of framing when engaging neighbours and mid‑sized states; normative claims can disguise geopolitical competition.  
- Instrumentalisation of frozen conflicts: Territorial disputes and frozen conflicts are effective levers that can be used to limit partner mobility. India must recognize how border and insurgency issues can be exploited in great‑power competition in its neighbourhood (e.g., Kashmir, ethnic flashpoints, proxy dynamics).  
- Mixed signalling as a tool: Moscow’s tactical ambiguity (outright dismissal at times, conditional engagement at others) preserved options. India’s strategic culture can learn from such flexibility—maintaining calibrated ambiguity may protect strategic autonomy while keeping diplomatic options open.  
- The limits of normative power: The EU case shows that normative attraction (rule‑based offers, market access) depends on credible capacity and domestic resilience. India’s normative and developmental offers in South Asia and the Indo‑Pacific must be backed by predictable resources if they are to counter rival influence.  
- Need for partner resilience: Supporting the institutional and economic resilience of neighbours reduces their susceptibility to coercion. For Indian policy this implies investments in connectivity, energy security, trade facilitation and governance assistance targeted to reduce leverage by other powers.  
- Managing escalation risks: Disputes over recognition, territory and alignment can escalate into broader confrontation. India should calibrate strategies to avoid entanglement in zero‑sum neighbourhood contests while protecting core interests.

Policy lessons and recommended follow‑up analysis for policymakers and scholars  
- Map instruments and responses: Examine which EaP instruments (AA/DCFTA) moved particular countries closer to the EU, and how Russia reacted in each case—this helps link policy offers to measurable responses.  
- Vulnerability mapping: For each neighbour identify leverage points—energy dependence, trade exposure, security ties, diaspora linkages—and craft resilience packages accordingly.  
- Track domestic politics: Domestic political shifts in partner states (elites, public opinion, corruption, rule‑of‑law indicators) condition their susceptibility to outside influence; continuous monitoring is essential.  
- Assess major crises’ effects: Study the longer‑term effects of the 2013–2014 Ukraine crisis on EaP dynamics to understand how acute crises reshape medium‑term strategic competition.  
- Strengthen credibility of offers: For India, as for the EU, the credibility of partnership hinges on the ability to deliver tangible economic, infrastructural, and security benefits—invest in predictable financing and implementation capacity.  
- Scenario planning: Prepare scenarios for how a regional hegemon may react to external offers in India’s neighbourhood (e.g., China’s likely tools and thresholds for coercion), and design instruments to limit coercive potential (energy diversification; alternative trade routes; local institution building).

Conclusion  
The EaP episode encapsulates the interplay between normative attraction and hard‑edged geopolitical rivalry in a shared neighbourhood. For India, the lessons are concrete: narratives of sovereignty can be weaponised; frozen conflicts will be exploited; mixed signals can be a deliberate strategy; and the credibility of partnership depends on capacity to deliver. Indian strategic culture—grounded in autonomy, non‑alignment traditions and a preference for incrementalism—can draw from these observations to design policies that bolster partner resilience, manage great‑power signalling, and maintain strategic flexibility in a competitive regional environment.

Suggested immediate follow‑up reading and research tasks (concise)  
- Comparative study of EaP Association Agreements and which countries signed DCFTAs; map subsequent Russian responses.  
- Country‑level vulnerability assessments (energy, trade, security) for India’s neighbourhood.  
- Case study comparison: Russia–EU competition in the EaP vs. China–India dynamics in South Asia.

## Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum (EaP CSF)

Background and institutional placement
- The Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum (EaP CSF) was founded at the Prague Eastern Partnership Summit in 2009 and held its first Forum meeting in Brussels the same year. It was created as an integral institutional platform within the European Union’s Eastern Partnership (EaP) programme, designed to give civil society actors structured access to the EaP architecture and to EU decision‑makers.
- The Forum’s Secretariat is based in Brussels, a deliberate locational choice that places it in immediate proximity to EU institutions and facilitates sustained advocacy, information exchange and coordination with EU Delegations and other Brussels‑based actors.

Composition, governance and rhythm of activity
- Membership and structure:
  - The Forum aggregates civil society across the six EaP countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine) through six national platforms (one for each country).
  - Complementing the national platforms are five thematic working groups addressing cross‑cutting policy areas (typical topics include democracy and human rights; rule of law; economic convergence; social policies; and people‑to‑people contacts — names and emphases may vary over time).
  - As of January 2025 the EaP CSF counted over 1,200 member organisations, indicating both broad reach and significant coordination challenges.
- Governance:
  - The Forum is represented by an annually elected Steering Committee composed of 13 members. Annual elections and rotating representation aim to preserve legitimacy across national and thematic constituencies.
- Meetings and outputs:
  - The EaP CSF meets annually to review developments and set its work programme. The 2009 inaugural meeting took place in Brussels; most recently, the Civil Society Summit was held in Vienna in November 2024, continuing a tradition established by sixteen preceding Annual Assemblies.
  - The 2024 Summit brought together some 90 civil society organisations from EaP countries and EU member states and adopted a resolution containing a set of policy recommendations intended to influence EaP policy and EU decision‑making.

Purpose, functions and flagship instruments
- Core purpose:
  - The Forum provides space for civil society organisations (CSOs) to monitor and discuss democracy‑building, rule of law and human rights in the six partner countries. Its main aim is to support the effective participation of civil society from both EaP and EU countries in planning, monitoring and implementing EaP policy.
  - As an official interlocutor within the EaP architecture, the Forum maintains dialogue with EU and EaP decision‑makers to promote democratic transformation and, for some members, European integration.
- Flagship monitoring instrument:
  - In 2011 the EaP CSF launched the Eastern Partnership Index, a data‑driven biennial monitoring tool. The Index tracks the reform trajectories of the six EaP states toward sustainable democratic development and European integration and is used by policymakers, donors and civil society to benchmark reforms and target assistance.
- Outputs and advocacy practice:
  - The Forum issues annual resolutions and recommendations directed at the EU institutions, donor agencies and national governments. While these recommendations are non‑binding, they influence donor priorities and can feed into conditionalities that shape assistance programmes.
  - The Forum campaigns for increased political and financial support to civil society in the EaP region and has used its platform to highlight acute human rights crises — notably advocating for stronger EU responses to situations in Azerbaijan and Belarus.
  - The EaP CSF also monitors progress on European integration in countries such as Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia, aligning civil society scrutiny with those states’ comparatively stronger EU trajectories.

Norm diffusion, socialization and scholarly interpretations
- Beyond instrumental advocacy, the Forum functions as a vector for normative diffusion. Its regular interactions with EU institutions and its use of European policy frameworks enable the transmission of European values (democracy, human rights, rule of law) to participating organisations.
- Scholars have described a ‘socialization’ effect whereby EU‑sponsored norms become internalised by Forum participants — not only altering advocacy tactics and policy expectations, but also shaping organisational practices and professional standards among local CSOs.

Operational strengths, constraints and risks
- Strengths:
  - Official interlocutor status within the EaP architecture increases the Forum’s potential policy influence relative to ad hoc networks.
  - The Brussels base and a sizeable membership allow the EaP CSF to convene cross‑border coalitions, mobilise evidence (via the Index) and coordinate with bilateral donors and international NGOs.
- Constraints and risks:
  - Scale and coordination: a membership exceeding 1,200 organisations enhances legitimacy but complicates consensus‑building and internal coordination.
  - Civic space and security: varied political contexts across EaP states require the Forum to balance open engagement with measures to protect dissident voices. Closing civic spaces (legal restrictions, crackdowns) in some countries—most prominently Belarus and, episodically, Azerbaijan—undermine monitoring capacity and place activists at risk.
  - Financial sustainability: many member CSOs remain dependent on external funding (EU and member‑state donors). This dependency creates vulnerability to donor shifts and political pressure, which the Forum itself campaigns to mitigate.
  - Operational resilience: threats include legal harassment, digital insecurity, and the need for rapid response mechanisms when members face emergency repression.

Comparative significance and uniqueness
- The EaP CSF represents a distinctive model of structured regional civil society engagement: there is no direct equivalent for the Western Balkans or the EU’s Southern Neighbourhood that combines the same institutionalised national platforms, thematic working groups and formal interlocutor status inside an EU external policy framework.
- Because of this perceived uniqueness, the EaP model has been proposed as a template for structured civil society engagement elsewhere and therefore warrants comparative study as a possible “best practice” for combining monitoring, advocacy and norm diffusion.

Policy implications and recommendations (for policymakers, donors and practitioners)
- Sustain institutional access:
  - Maintain and strengthen the Brussels Secretariat’s access to EU institutions to preserve the Forum’s role as an effective interlocutor.
- Financial diversification and resilience:
  - Protect and diversify funding for the EaP CSF and member organisations to reduce vulnerability to donor realignment and political pressure.
- Security and digital support:
  - Prioritise digital security, legal aid and rapid response mechanisms for CSOs operating in repressive environments to safeguard activists, data and organisational continuity.
- Evidence‑based policy engagement:
  - Use the Eastern Partnership Index systematically in policy dialogues so that evidence informs targeted reform assistance and donor programming.
- Inclusivity and representativeness:
  - Encourage broader participation across national platforms — including youth, women’s groups, minority and local organisations — to strengthen legitimacy and policy relevance.
- Documentation and exportability:
  - Document and disseminate the EaP CSF model as a potential template for structured civil society engagement in other external policy regions.
- Monitoring and evaluation:
  - Establish systematic monitoring and evaluation of the Forum’s impact on policy outcomes to strengthen credibility and refine advocacy tactics.
- Resilience measures:
  - Support legal, financial and operational resilience measures for CSOs facing tightening civic spaces, with emphasis on rapid assistance and cross‑border solidarity mechanisms.

A short comparative note for Indian strategic thinking
- For scholars and practitioners of India’s strategic culture and national security policy, the EaP CSF offers a useful case study of how external actors (here, the EU) can institutionalise civil society engagement as part of a broader regional policy toolkit. Key lessons include:
  - Institutionalising civil society as a formal interlocutor can increase policy influence and create durable channels for norm transmission without supplanting domestic agency.
  - Evidence tools (like the Eastern Partnership Index) can anchor advocacy in measurable benchmarks and guide donor prioritisation.
  - Protection of civic space and financial resilience are not merely normative concerns but are central to the operational effectiveness of any externally supported civil society network.
  - Where a state’s strategic posture views civil society as part of external influence operations, tailored protection and security measures are necessary to preserve the ability of independent actors to operate safely.
- These insights are relevant for Indian policymakers considering how to engage, support or interact with organised civil society in neighbouring regions, in fora where India projects normative preferences, or in bilateral/multilateral partnerships that incorporate people‑to‑people dimensions.

## The Eastern Partnership Summits (2009–2021): Chronology, Content and Lessons for Strategic Outreach

This section provides a concise, analytically focused account of the six Eastern Partnership (EaP) summits (2009–2021), situating them as a coherent multilateral track through which the European Union sought to deepen relations with six post‑Soviet states. The aim here is not simply to catalogue meetings but to extract the institutional logics, political dynamics and practical instruments that underpinned the EaP process — material that can be read comparatively for India’s own strategic outreach and neighbourhood policy.

### Chronological list of EaP summits (brief factual record)
- 1st Eastern Partnership Summit — Prague, May 2009  
  Inaugural summit that formally launched the Eastern Partnership initiative, establishing the framework for enhanced political association and economic integration between the EU and Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.

- 2nd Eastern Partnership Summit — Warsaw, September 2011  
  A follow‑up high‑level meeting to assess early progress, reinforce commitments and set short‑term priorities for the EaP relationship.

- 3rd Eastern Partnership Summit — Vilnius, November 2013  
  A pivotal summit in geopolitical terms: Ukraine’s last‑minute decision not to sign an Association Agreement with the EU precipitated mass protests (Euromaidan) and dramatic regional repercussions, underscoring the EaP’s vulnerability to external pressure and domestic politics.

- 4th Eastern Partnership Summit — Riga, May 2015  
  Held against the backdrop of the 2014–15 crisis, this summit focused on reform implementation, resilience-building and stabilisation across the region.

- 5th Eastern Partnership Summit — Brussels, November 2017  
  Convened in the EU’s political centre, it emphasised concrete delivery — trade benefits, mobility measures and governance reforms — while acknowledging the differing speeds of domestic reform across partners.

- 6th Eastern Partnership Summit — Brussels, December 2021  
  The most recent summit in this series; held after a longer interval, it reaffirmed EU support and cooperation priorities in the face of new global and regional challenges (COVID‑19, evolving security dynamics and some democratic backsliding among partners).

### What the summits set out to do: stated objectives and instruments
Across the six summits the EaP articulated a consistent set of core objectives:
- deepen political association with the EU,
- promote economic integration (including negotiated Association Agreements and DCFTAs where possible),
- support rule of law, democratic governance and anti‑corruption,
- enhance energy security and physical connectivity,
- increase people‑to‑people contacts (visa facilitation and mobility).

To pursue these ends the EU combined high‑level political signalling (summits and communiqués) with concrete instruments: negotiation and signature of Association Agreements / Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Areas (DCFTAs) with several partners, visa liberalisation for certain partner citizens, targeted technical and financial assistance packages, and sectoral cooperation projects.

### Participants and variable engagement
Participants were the EU (European Commission and member state leaders via the European Council) and the six Eastern Partners: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Engagement was not uniform: Belarus’s involvement was intermittently limited by Minsk’s domestic politics and relations with Moscow, and partners differed substantially in reform ambition and capacity. The EaP therefore operated as a multi‑speed platform from the start.

### Geopolitical dynamics and constraints
An unavoidable dimension of EaP diplomacy was external competition, most notably Russia’s influence and pressure on some partners. The Vilnius moment (2013) starkly illustrated how external great‑power leverage could negate EU offers and alter domestic trajectories. These dynamics meant the EaP functioned simultaneously as an instrument of EU outreach and as a locus of geopolitical contestation — a reality that shaped summit agendas, compromise language in communiqués and the EU’s emphasis on conditionality and differentiation.

### Institutional logic and cadence
- Patterns: Early summits were roughly biennial, establishing a predictable political rhythm. The interval between the 2017 and 2021 summits lengthened owing to evolving political contexts and global disruptions (chiefly the COVID‑19 pandemic).
- Differentiation and “more‑for‑more”: Over time the EU adopted a calibrated approach — offering deeper cooperation to partners that met reform benchmarks (the ‘more‑for‑more’ logic). This created performance incentives but also raised questions about equity and perceptions of selective engagement.
- Follow‑up: Summits set political direction; detailed implementation and monitoring occurred through technical working groups, annual ministerial meetings, civil society forums and bilateral tracks. This multi‑layered follow‑up was essential to translate summit proclamations into deliverables.

### Practical policy focus reinforced at summits
Common, recurring areas of emphasis included:
- trade and market access,
- public administration and judicial reform,
- anti‑corruption measures,
- energy diversification and security,
- border and migration management,
- mobility and visa facilitation.

These are the granular policy domains where political commitments were intended to produce measurable change.

### Outcomes and limits
Key tangible outcomes across the period included the negotiation and signature of Association Agreements / DCFTAs with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine (and deepened cooperation with Armenia at times), visa liberalisation for parts of the citizenry of several partners, and targeted EU financial and technical assistance. Yet outcomes were constrained by domestic political will in partner states, frozen conflicts and external interference. The EaP delivered important institutional linkages and normative influence, but transformation was uneven and unfinished.

### Implications for stakeholders
- For partner governments: summits were opportunities to secure political backing, financing and market access; however, success required credible domestic reform.
- For the EU: the EaP consolidated influence on its eastern flank, projected norms and sought to enhance stability at the Union’s borders — but it also exposed the EU’s limits in contexts where domestic elites or external actors opposed its offers.

### Risks and structural limits
The main constraints on EaP ambitions were:
- domestic political backsliding within partner states,
- frozen or active conflicts (transnistria, Nagorno‑Karabakh, South Ossetia/Abkhazia),
- external pressures (notably from Russia),
- variable administrative capacity in partners,
- uneven EU member‑state priorities and internal cohesion.

These factors combined to make the achievement of comprehensive, uniform outcomes across all six partners unrealistic.

### Reading the sequence: what the summits tell us analytically
The EaP summit series is primarily a chronological record of EU–Eastern Partner high‑level engagement. However, to understand real impact one must read the communiqués, associated legal agreements, and the implementation records between summits. Patterns to note: the shift toward differentiation; the increasing emphasis on delivery and resilience after 2013–2015; and the institutionalisation of follow‑up mechanisms to bridge political declarations and administrative implementation.

### Comparative lessons for India’s strategic outreach and neighbourhood policy
While the EaP concerns a different geography and set of actors, several lessons are pertinent for Indian strategic culture and national security policy when designing multilateral and regional partnerships:

- Use of layered instruments: Political summits are necessary for signalling resolve, but must be backed by technical follow‑up, funding, and capacity building to produce durable change.
- Differentiation as incentive: A calibrated “more‑for‑more” approach can incentivise reform but requires transparent benchmarks to be credible and to avoid perceptions of arbitrariness.
- Expect external contestation: Partnerships that touch on spheres of influence will attract counter‑pressure; strategists must plan for geopolitical spoilers and design resilient modalities (e.g., incremental projects with strong local ownership).
- Domestic ownership matters: External offers of market access or political association will yield results only where domestic actors possess the will and administrative capacity to implement reforms.
- Multi‑speed engagement is pragmatic: Different partners may advance at different paces; frameworks should allow asymmetry while preserving an overarching normative and practical coherence.
- Summit diplomacy’s limits: High‑level meetings are indispensable for political momentum, but their declarations require sustained, often technical, work to realize objectives.

Concluding remark: the EaP summits exemplify how a major regional actor institutionalises outreach to a diverse set of neighbours through a blend of normative appeal, economic incentives and procedural mechanisms. For Indian policymakers and strategists reflecting on “Neighbourhood First” or broader global partnerships, the EaP experience highlights both the possibilities and the constraints of summit‑driven, conditional, multi‑layered engagement.

Further analysis of each summit’s communiqués, the legal texts (Association Agreements/DCFTAs) and implementation monitoring reports is recommended for readers seeking detailed evidence of policy impact and a granular basis for comparative policy transfer.

### Case Study: The European Union’s Eastern Partnership — Conceptual and Empirical Dilemmas and Lessons for Indian Strategic Engagement

Context and brief history
- The Eastern Partnership (EaP) was launched on 7 May 2009 as an EU policy framework to deepen relations with six countries in the EU’s eastern neighbourhood: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.  
- By early 2010 an independent, ESRC-funded UK research project produced a critical assessment of the initiative, examining EU relations with three EaP states — Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova — and identifying both conceptual and empirical tensions within the policy.

Core findings: two interlinked dilemmas
1. Conceptual dilemma — ambiguity of aims
   - The research found that the EU did not possess a uniform, operationally clear conception of what it sought to promote under terms such as “shared values”, “collective norms”, and “joint ownership.”  
   - These normative catchphrases lacked precision: it was unclear which behaviours, institutions or benchmarks they entailed in practice, and how far the EU expected partner states to change versus adapt pre-existing arrangements.

2. Empirical dilemma — preference for top‑down governance
   - In practice, EU behaviour toward the three states studied displayed a reliance on rule and norm transfer and on conditionality: incentives (access to funding, market integration, association agreements) were tied to political and legal reforms.  
   - This top‑down approach — technocratic policy transfer and conditional incentives — clashed with the voluntary and consultative language of “partnership.” It limited the agency of partner governments and domestic actors in shaping reforms, making “partnership” often a label rather than a lived practice.

Plain language summary
- The EU launched the EaP with lofty, cooperative rhetoric but without a consistent internal definition of its objectives.  
- Despite talk of shared ownership, the EU mostly pushed reform agendas through conditional incentives and model-driven rule transfer rather than co‑producing reforms with partners.  
- The result was a mismatch between cooperative vocabulary and actual implementation methods.

Key concepts (operational definitions)
- Shared values: normative goals the EU expects partners to converge on (democracy, rule of law, human rights). In practice these require specification (which rights, which institutional models, what sequencing).  
- Collective norms: common regulatory and institutional standards that make cooperation and interoperability feasible across states.  
- Joint ownership: the notion that reforms are co‑designed and co‑implemented by external partners and domestic actors rather than imposed unilaterally.  
- Top‑down governance: mechanisms of policy transfer from an external actor (here the EU) to partners, typically through conditionality — tying benefits to prescribed reforms.

Additional contextual points relevant to interpretation
- Participants and variation: the EaP covered six states with diverse political systems and capacities. Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova differed significantly in democratic development, state capacity and social cleavages — factors that condition how external templates are received.  
- Conditionality as an EU tool: conditioning access to financial assistance, legal approximation and market access on compliance with reform benchmarks is a well-established EU external-policy mechanism.  
- Power asymmetry: the EU’s greater resources and agenda-setting authority create structural imbalances; this asymmetry shapes negotiations and limits symmetrical co‑production.
  
Consequences and implications
- Policy incoherence: lack of clarity about objectives produces inconsistent signals to partners and variable implementation by EU institutions and member states.  
- Limited local legitimacy: reforms pushed through conditionality may generate superficial compliance or elite capture rather than deep institutionalisation, weakening long‑term effectiveness.  
- Credibility costs: persistent gap between rhetoric of partnership and practice risks eroding the EU’s normative credibility among neighbours.  
- One‑size‑fits‑all problems: applying uniform top‑down templates across diverse domestic contexts reduces policy effectiveness and may provoke backlash in states with weaker administrative capacities or different political priorities.

Policy recommendations (to address the dilemmas)
- Clarify objectives: the EU (or any external actor in a similar position) should internally align on the operational meaning of “shared values” and “joint ownership,” translating them into measurable, context‑sensitive benchmarks.  
- Combine conditionality with genuine co‑production: maintain incentives for reform but embed them in mechanisms for partner input and joint design (co‑financing, joint roadmaps, shared performance indicators).  
- Strengthen partner voice: create structured, sustained consultations that include governments, sub‑national authorities, civil society and private sector actors in programme design and monitoring.  
- Invest in capacity‑building: support administrative, judicial and societal capacities so that partner states can genuinely own and sustain reforms rather than merely adopt external templates.  
- Monitor uptake qualitatively: evaluate success not only by formal legal alignment but by indicators of local uptake — institutional routines, public legitimacy, and durable behavioural change.

Comparative lesson for India’s strategic culture and external partnerships
- For a state like India — whose strategic culture emphasises sovereignty, non‑imposition and asymmetric relationships with neighbours — the EaP case offers several transferable lessons:  
  - Beware of rhetorical partnership divorced from practice. India’s external assistance and regional initiatives (e.g., neighbourhood infrastructure, capacity support) will be more effective if framed as co‑production rather than one‑way transfer.  
  - Tailor approaches to domestic contexts. India’s bilateral and regional engagements should avoid uniform templates and instead align support with recipient administrative capacities, political sensitivities and local ownership.  
  - Balance incentives and agency. Where conditionality is used (e.g., linking assistance to governance benchmarks), couple it with meaningful local participation and capacity investments to avoid superficial compliance.  
  - Manage power asymmetry responsibly. India’s relative influence in South Asia and its extended neighbourhood carries obligations: to preserve legitimacy and sustainability, asymmetry should be paired with transparent dialogue, predictable assistance, and respect for domestic sequencing.

Concluding remark
- The Eastern Partnership critique underscores a perennial tension in international engagement between normative ambition and implementation practice. For both multilateral actors like the EU and states like India seeking strategic influence through partnership, the test is whether professed ideals of “shared values” and “joint ownership” are operationalised through participatory, context‑sensitive instruments that empower local agency rather than substitute for it.
