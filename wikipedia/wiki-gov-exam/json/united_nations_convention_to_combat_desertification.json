It is the only internationally\nlegally binding framework set up to address the problem of desertification.\nThe Convention is based on the principles of participation, partnership and\ndecentralization\u2014the backbone of good governance and sustainable development.\nIt has 197 parties, making it near universal in reach.\n\nTo help publicise the Convention, 2006 was declared \"International Year of\nDeserts and Desertification\" but debates have ensued regarding how effective\nthe International Year was in practice."

It has been located in\nBonn, Germany, since January 1999, and moved from its first Bonn address in\nHaus Carstanjen to the new UN Campus in July 2006.\n\nThe functions of the secretariat are to make arrangements for sessions of the\nConference of the Parties (COP) and its subsidiary bodies established under\nthe Convention, and to provide them with services as required. One key task of\nthe secretariat is to compile and transmit reports submitted to it.\n\nThe secretariat also provides assistance to affected developing country\nparties, particularly those in Africa. This is important when compiling\ninformation and reports required under the Convention. UNCCD activities are\ncoordinated with the secretariats of other relevant international bodies and\nconventions, like those of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\n(UNFCCC) and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)."

The committee identifies priorities for\nresearch, and recommends ways of strengthening cooperation among researchers.\nIt is multi-disciplinary and open to the participation of all Parties. It\nmeets in conjunction with the ordinary sessions of the COP.\n\nThe CST collects, analyses and reviews relevant data. It also promotes\ncooperation in the field of combating desertification and mitigating the\neffects of drought through appropriate sub-regional, regional and national\ninstitutions, and in particular by its activities in research and development,\nwhich contribute to increased knowledge of the processes leading to\ndesertification and drought as well as their impact.\n\nThe Bureau of the CST is composed of the Chairperson and the four Vice-\nChairpersons. The chairman is elected by the Conference of the Parties at each\nof its sessions with due regard to ensure geographical distribution and\nadequate representation of affected Country Parties, particularly those in\nAfrica, who shall not serve for more than two consecutive terms. The Bureau of\nthe CST is responsible for the follow-up of the work of the Committee between\nsessions of the COP and may benefit from the assistance of ad hoc panels\nestablished by the COP.\n\nThe CST also contributes to distinguishing causal factors, both natural and\nhuman, with a view to combating desertification and achieving improved\nproductivity as well as the sustainable use and management of resources.\n\nUnder the authority of the CST, a Group of Experts was established by the COP\nwith a specific work programme, to assist in improving the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the CST. This Group of Experts, working under the authority\nof the CST, provides advice on the areas of drought and desertification."
