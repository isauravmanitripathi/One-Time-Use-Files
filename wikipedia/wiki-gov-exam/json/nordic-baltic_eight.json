The most profound bond, however was created during the 1990s.\n\nThe Nordic Council first contacted Baltic parliamentarians in around 1989.\nOfficial co-operation began in November 1991, when the Nordic Council attended\nthe inaugural meeting of the Baltic Assembly in Tallinn. A formal co-operation\nagreement between the Nordic Council and the Baltic Assembly was signed in\n1992.\n\nThe Nordic countries were amongst the strongest supporters of the Baltic\ncountries' independence and later they were the first to open their borders,\nintroducing visa-free regimes with the Baltic countries.\n\nWhen Baltic countries regained their independence and during their integration\ninto the European and transatlantic structures, they were strongly supported\nby their Nordic neighbors. The Nordic-Baltic co-operation took place in\nvarious levels: networking and cooperation were established among politicians,\ncivil servants and civil societies. The Nordic countries actively assisted the\nBaltic countries in their preparations for integration into the European Union\nand NATO.\n\nNamed as 5+3 in the beginning of cooperation (five Nordic countries plus three\nBaltic States), the format changed its name and scope of cooperation. During\nthe meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Baltic States and\nNordic Countries on 30 August 2000 in Middelfart (Denmark), the Ministers\ndecided that the meetings of the Ministers of the Baltic States and Nordic\nCountries will be called NB8."

As was\nassessed in a press release for the upcoming coordination by the Swedish\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs, the areas of focus were directed towards the\nfollowing: 1. Focus on the Eastern Partnership and joint agenda for the NB8\nbefore the EU-summit in Vilnius, November 2013. 2. Cooperation within energy\nas an area of mutual interests, especially as a monitor of energy-related\nissues within other forums. The task of arranging most of the NB8 meetings and\nevents in Sweden was assigned to the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn 2014, NB8 coordinator was Estonia with priorities being cyber cooperation,\nEastern Partnership, energy cooperation, and security cooperation. In 2014\nEstonia was also the coordinator for Baltic Cooperation and Council of the\nBaltic Sea States. Coordination of these three formats was named as the\n\"Baltic Sea Year\".\n\nIn 2015, Denmark's NB8 priorities were energy security, media in relation to\nRussian-speakers, the Russo-Ukrainian war and the Eastern Partnership.\n\nBanner of the Baltic and Nordic Cooperation Year chaired by Latvia in 2016.\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Latvia\n\nIn 2016, Latvia's NB8 priorities were the strengthening of security (including\nstrengthening of energy security, promotion of strategic communication,\nreinforcing cyber security, fight against hybrid threats) and support for the\nEU Eastern Partnership.\n\nIn 2017, the coordinating country was Norway. The priorities were set in\nregional issues (regional security, hybrid and resilience issues,\ncybersecurity, open and free media, strategic communication, energy security\nand energy markets, EU Eastern Partnership, attention to the Estonian\nPresidency of the Council of the EU, economic development, competitiveness and\ninnovation, synergies among Nordic 5, NB6 and Nordic Council of Ministers).\nThe other set of priorities was based in broader strategic issues\n(transatlantic relations (United States, NATO, Euro-Atlantic bonds), the\nfuture of the European Union, _Brexit_ , migration, the Bratislava process),\nRussia, UN issues (including the Security Council) and terrorism.\n\nIn 2020, Estonia coordinated both the NB8 as well as the Baltic Council of\nMinisters.

In addition to\nthe foreign ministers and prime ministers, other ministers and ministry\nofficials also meet on a regular basis. In the realm of foreign policy, there\nare many meetings held in addition to the annual meeting of the foreign\nministers. The secretaries general, political directors, and experts in\nvarious fields from the foreign ministries also get together regularly, and\nthere are frequent meetings of diplomats in foreign representations within the\nNB8 format.\n\nDuring the recent years the Baltic and Nordic countries have developed a\ncohesive network of cooperation activities in political, military, economic,\nenvironmental, cultural and other aspects. After the EU and NATO enlargement\nin 2004 cooperation is becoming closer thereby activating the potential for\ndevelopment in the Baltic Sea region. Several examples of such evolved\ncooperation is the work of NB8 Task Force against Trafficking in Human Beings\nand the creation of the common Nordic \u2013 Baltic education and research area.\n\nOn 17 August 2010, the financial supervisory authorities, central banks,\nfinance ministries and other relevant ministries of Denmark, Estonia, Finland,\nIceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway and Sweden signed a cross-border agreement\non financial stability. The Nordic-Baltic Cooperation Agreement on Cross-\nborder Financial Stability enhanced cooperation by establishing routines and\nprocedures for information sharing and coordination. The aim is to reduce the\nrisk of a financial crisis spreading cross-border, and to enhance\npossibilities to reach an efficient crisis management. By signing the\nagreement, the public authorities in the Nordic and Baltic countries increase\ntheir preparedness to handle problems in cross-border banks.

Three Baltic states have established the\nBaltic Council of Ministers as well as the Baltic Assembly, whereas the\nintegration of the Nordic countries has achieved an unprecedented level in the\npast forty years since the Nordic Council of Ministers was established in\n1971. Cooperation among the parliamentarians of the Baltic Assembly and the\nNordic Council dates back to 1989.\n\nThe Nordic Council of Ministers offices opened in the three Baltic capitals\n(Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius) in 1991 play a key role in the dynamic\nNordic\u2013Baltic co-operation."
