Its seat will be in Vienna, Austria. The organization\nwill be tasked with verifying the ban on nuclear tests and will operate\ntherefore a worldwide monitoring system and may conduct on-site inspections.\nThe Preparatory Commission for the CTBTO, and its Provisional Technical\nSecretariat, were established in 1997 and are headquartered in Vienna,\nAustria."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty will enter into force 180 days after\nthe Treaty has been ratified by 44 States, listed in Annex 2 of the Treaty,\nwhich were designated to have a nuclear reactor or at least some advanced\nlevel of nuclear technology. As of November 2023, 41 of these Annex 2 states\nhave signed the treaty and 35 have ratified. India, North Korea and Pakistan\nhave not signed or ratified the treaty; China, Egypt, Iran, Israel and the\nUnited States have signed but have not ratified; while Russia signed and\nratified the treaty but subsequently withdrew its ratification prior to its\nentry into force. The organization's scientific reporting claims 2.4 million\npersons will eventually die from cancers developed as a result of atmospheric\natomic tests conducted between 1945 and 1980."

The main task is establishing and\nprovisionally operating the 337-facility International Monitoring System\n(IMS), including its International Data Centre (IDC) and Global Communications\nInfrastructure (GCI). The Commission is tasked also with the development of\noperational manuals, including a manual to guide conduct of on-site\ninspections."

The Preparatory\nCommission has started the building and verification of the system of which as\nof 2023[update] about 90% was operational."

        "generated_section_content_md": "If an event detected by the IMS (or by other means) raises concerns about\nviolation of the basic obligations of the CTBT, an OSI may be conducted to\nclarify whether a nuclear explosion has taken place. Such an inspection could\ntake place only after entry into force of the Treaty, and would require\nagreement by at least 30 of the 51 members of the CTBTO's Executive Council.\nAn inspection area of up to 1000 square kilometres would be searched by a team\nof inspectors (up to 40). Only State Parties to the Treaty may submit a\nrequest for an OSI.\n\nWhen conducting an OSI, a number of detection techniques can be used. These\ntechniques include position finding, visual observation, passive seismic\nmeasurements and radioactivity measurements including gamma radiation and\nradioactive noble gases such as argon-37 and isotopes of xenon for an initial\nperiod of up to 25 days. Further, for a continuation period of up to 60 days,\nmore intrusive measurements can be used on-site including active and resonance\nseismic measurements as well as ground penetrating radar, gravity, and\nelectric and magnetic field mappings. Argon-37 field measurement is a unique\ntechnology specially developed for the purpose of OSI. Drilling to obtain\nradioactive samples from a suspected underground explosion site is also\nallowed. Data collected from various methods have to be fused and interpreted\nfor decision making purposes. An important task of the CTBTO is to explore how\nrecent scientific and technical advances in these technologies can be applied\nto an OSI."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In addition to the IMS, C&C and OSI, the verification regime of the CTBT\nincludes also the fourth element of Confidence-Building Measures. This\nrequires States Parties to the treaty to notify the Organization, if possible\nin advance, of any chemical explosion using 300 tonnes or greater of TNT-\nequivalent blasting material to be detonated. This is required in order to\ncontribute to the timely resolution of any compliance concerns and to assist\nin the calibration of IMS stations."
