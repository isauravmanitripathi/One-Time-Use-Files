        "generated_section_content_md": "Founded after World War II in the context of millions of refugees, missing and\ndisplaced people, the organisation's aim was to facilitate the cooperation\nbetween states in establishing, recognising and validating civil status\ndocuments, also known as vital records, such as birth, marriage and death\ncertificates. It did so by drafting international treaties such as the\nConvention on the issue of multilingual extracts from civil status records,\nwhich provides standard multilingual formats of vital records, allowing their\ninternational acceptance without the need for translation or legalisation.\nLater conventions drafted by the ICCS include the Convention on the\nrecognition of decisions recording a sex reassignment."

In 1952, a\nprotocol opened the organisation to accession by any state. By 1999, 11 more\nstates had acceded to the ICCS, reaching a peak of 16 member states. After\n2007, only one more state acceded and 12 states left the organisation,\nresulting in only five member states by 2022.
