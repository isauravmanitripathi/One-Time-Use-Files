It was renamed the **Conference on Disarmament** in\n1984.\n\nThe Conference succeeded three other disarmament-related bodies: the Ten\nNation Committee on Disarmament (1960), the Eighteen Nation Committee on\nDisarmament (1962\u20131968) and the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament\n(1969\u20131978).\n\nThe Conference was created with a permanent agenda, also known as the\n\"Decalogue\", which includes the following topics:\n\n* Nuclear weapons in all aspects\n* Other weapons of mass destruction\n* Conventional weapons\n* Reduction of military budgets\n* Reduction of armed forces\n* Disarmament and development\n* Disarmament and international security\n* Collateral measures; confidence building measures; effective verification methods in relation to appropriate disarmament measures, acceptable to all parties\n* Comprehensive programme of disarmament leading to general and complete disarmament under effective international control\n\nAdditionally, all decisions of the body must be agreed upon by consensus\naccording to the rules and procedures of the conference."

However, while\nit is not formally a UN organization, it is linked to it in various ways.\nFirst and foremost, the Director-General of the United Nations Office at\nGeneva serves as the Secretary-General of the Conference. Furthermore, while\nthe Conference adopts its own rules of procedure and agenda, the United\nNations General Assembly can pass resolutions recommending specific topics to\nthe Conference. Finally, the Conference submits a report of its activities to\nthe General Assembly yearly, or more frequently, as appropriate.\n\nThe Conference on Disarmament Secretariat and Conference Support Branch of the\nUnited Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, based in Geneva, provides\norganizational and substantive servicing to the Conference on Disarmament, the\nsingle multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international\ncommunity."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Initially, the Conference and its predecessors were successful in meeting\ntheir mandate. They were instrumental in drafting numerous arms control\nagreements: most importantly, the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons (1968), the Biological Weapons Convention (1972), the Chemical Weapons\nConvention (1993) and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (1996).\n\nHowever, the work of the body was stalled for over a decade, as members were\nunable to agree on a work program after the passage of the Comprehensive\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Difficulties included strained relations between key\nplayers, disagreement among members on the prioritization of issues, and\nattempts of some countries to link progress in one area to parallel progress\nin other areas.\n\nThen, in 2009 a breakthrough was made by the body when it established several\nworking groups to tackle various topics under the Conference's authority.\nThese group focused on: negotiating a treaty banning the production of fissile\nmaterial for nuclear weapons (FMCT), creating practical steps to reduce\nnuclear weapons, Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer Space (PAROS) and\naddressing negative security assurances.\n\nDue to the general dysfunction of the Conference and its limited membership,\nnegotiations for the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons took\nplace at the United Nations, and not at the Conference."
