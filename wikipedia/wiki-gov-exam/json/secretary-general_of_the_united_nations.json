        "generated_section_content_md": "The Secretariat Building is a 154-metre-tall (505 ft) skyscraper and the\ncenterpiece of the Headquarters of the United Nations.\n\nThe secretary-general is appointed by the General Assembly upon the\nrecommendation of the Security Council. As the recommendation must come from\nthe Security Council, any of the five permanent members of the council can\nveto a nomination. Most secretaries-general are compromise candidates from\nmiddle powers and have little prior fame.\n\nUnofficial qualifications for the job have been set by precedent in previous\nselections. The appointee may not be a citizen of any of the Security\nCouncil's five permanent members. The General Assembly resolution 51/241 in\n1997 stated that, in the appointment of \"the best candidate\", due regard\nshould be given to regional (continental) rotation of the appointee's national\norigin and to gender equality, although no woman has yet served as secretary-\ngeneral. All appointees to date have been career diplomats.\n\nThe length of the term is discretionary, but all secretaries-general since\n1971 have been appointed to five-year terms. Every secretary-general since\n1961 has been re-selected for a second term, with the exception of Boutros\nBoutros-Ghali, who was vetoed by the United States in the 1996 selection.\nWhile the position does not have a formal term limit, incumbent secretary-\ngenerals have avoided seeking a third term since the 1981 selection, when\nChina cast a record 16 vetoes against a third term for Kurt Waldheim.\n\nThe selection process is opaque and is often compared to a papal conclave.\nSince 1981, the Security Council has voted in secret in a series of straw\npolls; it then submits the winning candidate to the General Assembly for\nratification. No candidate has ever been rejected by the General Assembly, and\nonly once, in 1950, has a candidate been voted upon despite a UNSC veto.\n\nIn 2016, the General Assembly and the Security Council sought nominations and\nconducted public debates for the first time. However, the Security Council\nvoted in private and followed the same process as previous selections, leading\nthe president of the General Assembly to complain that it \"does not live up to\nthe expectations of the membership and the new standard of openness and\ntransparency\"."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The UN Charter designates the secretary-general as the \"chief administrative\nofficer\" of the UN, and gives the secretary-general the power to make\nemployment decisions about Secretariat staff. The Charter also empowers the\nsecretary-general to inform the Security Council of \"any matter which in his\nopinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security\", and\nallows the secretary-general to perform \"such other functions as are\nentrusted\" by other United Nations organs. These provisions have been\ninterpreted as providing broad leeway for officeholders to serve a variety of\nroles as suited to their preferences, skill set, or circumstances. The UN\ndescribes the role of the secretary-general as combining the functions and\nresponsibilities of an advocate, diplomat, civil servant, and chief executive\nofficer.\n\nThe secretary-general's routine duties include overseeing the activities and\nduties of the secretariat; attending sessions with United Nations bodies;\nconsulting with world leaders, government officials, and other stakeholders;\nand travelling the world to engage with global constituents and bring\nattention to certain international issues. The secretary-general publishes an\nannual report on the work of the UN, which includes an assessment of its\nactivities and an outline future priorities. The secretary-general is also the\nchairman of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination\n(CEB), a body composed of the heads of all UN funds, programmes, and\nspecialised agencies, which meets twice a year to discuss substantive and\nmanagement issues facing the United Nations System.\n\nMany of the secretary-general's powers are informal and left open to\nindividual interpretation; some appointees have opted for more activist roles,\nwhile others have been more technocratic or administrative. The secretary-\ngeneral is often reliant upon the use of their \"good offices\", described as\n\"steps taken publicly and in private, drawing upon his independence,\nimpartiality and integrity, to prevent international disputes from arising,\nescalating or spreading\". Consequently, observers have variably described the\noffice as the \"world's most visible bully pulpit\" or as the \"world's\nmoderator\". Examples include Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld's promotion of an armistice\nbetween the warring parties of Arab-Israel conflict, Javier Perez de Cuellar's\nnegotiation of a ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq War, and U Thant's role in\ndeescalating the Cuban Missile Crisis."

After the UN involvement in the Korean War, the Soviet Union vetoed Lie's reappointment in 1951. The United States circumvented the Soviet Union's veto and recommended reappointment directly to the General Assembly. Lie was reappointed by a vote of 46 to 5, with eight abstentions. The Soviet Union remained hostile to Lie, and he resigned in 1952.\n**2** |  | Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld\n(1905\u20131961) | 10 April 1953  | 18 September 1961 \u2020  | 8 years, 312 days  |  Sweden | Western European and Others | After a series of candidates were vetoed, Hammarskj\u00f6ld emerged as an option that was acceptable to the Security Council. He was re-elected unanimously to a second term in 1957. The Soviet Union was angered by Hammarskj\u00f6ld's leadership of the UN during the Congo Crisis, and suggested that the position of secretary-general be replaced by a troika, or three-man executive. Facing great opposition from the Western nations, the Soviet Union gave up on its suggestion. Hammarskj\u00f6ld died in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in 1961. U.S. president John F. Kennedy called him \"the greatest statesman of our century\". Hammarskj\u00f6ld was posthumously awarded the 1961 Nobel Peace Prize.\n_**Acting**_ |  | U Thant\n(1909\u20131974) | 3 November 1961  | 30 November 1962  | 1 year, 27 days  |  Burma | Asia-Pacific | In the process of replacing Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the developing world insisted on a non-European and non-American secretary-general. U Thant was nominated. However, due to opposition from the French (Thant had chaired a committee on Algerian independence) and the Arabs (Burma supported Israel), Thant was only appointed for the remainder of Hammarskj\u00f6ld's term. He was the first Asian secretary-general. The following year, on 30 November, Thant was unanimously re-elected to a full term ending on 3 November 1966. At the General Assembly session on 2 December 1966, Thant was reappointed as secretary-general by a unanimous vote of the Security Council. His five-year term ended on 31 December 1971. Thant did not seek a third election. Thant is the only former secretary-general whose home country had not been in the Security Council in his term.\n**3** | 30 November 1962  | 31 December 1971  | 9 years, 31 days\n**4** |  | Kurt Waldheim\n(1918\u20132007) | 1 January 1972  | 31 December 1981  | 10 years  |  Austria | Western European and Others | Waldheim launched a discreet but effective campaign to become the secretary-general. Despite initial vetoes from China and the United Kingdom, in the third round, Waldheim was selected to become the new secretary-general. In 1976, China initially blocked Waldheim's re-election, but it relented on the second ballot. In 1981, Waldheim's re-election for a third term was blocked by China, which vetoed his selection through 15 rounds; although the official reasons by the Chinese government for the veto of Waldheim remain unclear, some estimates from the time believe it to be in part due to China's belief that a Third World country should give a nomination, particularly from the Americas; however, there also remained the question of his possible involvement in Nazi war crimes. From 1986 to 1992, Waldheim served as president of Austria, making him the first former secretary-general to rise to the position of head of state. In 1985, it was revealed that a post-World War II UN War Crimes Commission had labeled Waldheim as a suspected war criminal based on his involvement with the _Wehrmacht_. The files had been stored in the UN archive.\n**5** |  | Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar\n(1920\u20132020) | 1 January 1982  | 31 December 1991  | 10 years  |  Peru | Latin American and Caribbean | P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar was selected after a five-week deadlock between the re-election of Waldheim and China's candidate, Salim Ahmed Salim of Tanzania. P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, a Peruvian diplomat who a decade earlier had served as President of the UN Security Council during his time as Peruvian ambassador to the UN, was a compromise candidate. He became the first and thus far only secretary-general from the Americas. He was re-elected unanimously in 1986.\n**6** |  | Boutros Boutros-Ghali\n(1922\u20132016) | 1 January 1992  | 31 December 1996  | 5 years  |  Egypt | African | The 102-member Non-Aligned Movement insisted that the next secretary-general come from Africa. With a majority in the General Assembly and the support of China, the \"Non-Aligned Movement had the votes necessary to block any unfavorable candidate\". The Security Council conducted five anonymous straw polls\u2014a first for the council\u2014and Boutros-Ghali emerged with 11 votes on the fifth round. In 1996, the United States vetoed the re-appointment of Boutros-Ghali, claiming he had failed in implementing necessary reforms to the UN.\n**7** |  | Kofi Annan\n(1938\u20132018) | 1 January 1997  | 31 December 2006  | 10 years  |  Ghana | African | On 13 December 1996, the Security Council recommended Annan. He was confirmed four days later by the vote of the General Assembly. He started his second term as secretary-general on 1 January 2002. Kofi Annan and the United Nations were the recipients of the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize.\n**8** |  | Ban Ki-moon\n(b. 1944) | 1 January 2007  | 31 December 2016  | 10 years  |  South Korea | Asia-Pacific | Ban became the first East Asian to be selected as the secretary-general and the second Asian overall after U Thant. He was unanimously elected to a second term by the General Assembly on 21 June 2011. His second term began on 1 January 2012. Prior to his selection, he was the Foreign Minister of South Korea from January 2004 to November 2006.\n**9** |  | Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\n(b. 1949) | 1 January 2017  | _Incumbent_ | 8 years, 223 days  |  Portugal | Western European and Others | Guterres is the first former head of government to become secretary-general, and the first secretary-general born after the establishment of the United Nations. He was the prime minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002. He has also been president of the Socialist International (1999\u20132005) and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (2005\u20132015). His second term began on 1 January 2022. Since August 2024, Guterres also holds East-Timorese citizenship.\nMap showing which nations have had a national serving as secretary-general of\nthe United Nations"
