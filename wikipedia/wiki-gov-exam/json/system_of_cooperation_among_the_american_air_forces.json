Is based out\nof Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. SICOFAA started in 1961 as a forum\nfor senior leaders from Air Forces in the Western Hemisphere to discuss\nmilitary issues and aviation topics. Today, the organization has become more\nformalized, but has kept to its voluntary and apolitical status while striving\nto foster friendship and cooperation among American Air Forces through the\ninterchange of experiences, training and education. _SICOFAA_ also develops\nprocedures and plans to facilitate combined actions between air components of\nmember nations.\n\n_SICOFAA_ holds a yearly meeting called the **Conference of the American Air\nChiefs** or **CONJEFAMER** , this is where air chiefs and representatives from\n21 Western Hemisphere member nations meet, ranging from Canada to Argentina.\n\nThe location of each year's _CONJEFAMER_ conference rotates among member\nnations; this year (2014) the Colombian Air Force hosted the military\ndelegations during the week-long event.\n\nConference attendees meet to confer over recommendations and programs proposed\nduring _CONJEFAMER_ committee meetings held earlier this year.\n\nThe Organizations focused on the professional Airman and the interests of Air\nForces of each nation are vital in ensuring governments understand what\nairpower can provide to their citizens. SICOFAA ensures issues that apply to\nAir Forces across the Americas are discussed in an atmosphere of trust and\nunderstanding and that there is much we can learn from one another."

        "generated_section_content_md": "On April 16, 1961, US Air Force Chief of Staff Thomas D. White hosted a\nconference at Randolph Air Force Base. Here the delegates proposed on creating\nan organization that would help fortify the inter-institutional relations and\nplanning of effective professional cooperation of the American Air Forces.\n\nIn 1964, the Peruvian Air Force proposed the creation of a voluntary\norganization of mutual professional relations in a document titled \"Bases and\nProcedures for a Cooperation System between the American Air Forces\". This\ndocument was accepted in 1965 as the first corporate charter of SICOFAA.\n\nBefore 1990 SICOFAA consisted of three parts: the administrative (SPS), the\ncommunications (SITFAA), and the educational (IAAFA). During that time SICOFAA\nwas under the Twelfth Air Force (AFSOUTH). It was in that year that Hurricane\nAndrew destroyed Homstead Air Force Base where both the administrative and\neducational parts of SICOFAA were stationed. It was then that SICOFAA was\nreorganized, IAAFA was moved to Lackland AFB and the administrative portion\nwas moved to Andrews AFB. After this reorganization, the administrative\npartition was the only one that remained under the Twelfth Air Force. In 2011\nthe administrative portion was physically realigned to be collocated with the\nTwelfth Air Force (AFSOUTH) at Davis-Monthan AFB to be better supported."
