This meeting marked the first\nstep for developing trilateral cooperation and its framework, with 1999 being\ncelebrated as the first year of China-Japan-South Korea cooperation.\n\nThe three countries continued to hold annual meetings at the ASEAN+3 Summit.\nAfter several years of negotiations, the three countries agreed at the 2007\nASEAN+3 Summit to hold separate stand-alone meetings in the future. Hence, in\n2008, what began as a side-conference to the ASEAN meetings officially\ndeveloped into the first China-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Summit, held in\nFukuoka, Japan."
