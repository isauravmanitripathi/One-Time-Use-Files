        "generated_section_content_md": "In the 1960s, European countries felt the need to begin framing science\npolicies in order to bridge the gap in science and technology between Europe\nand the USA. As a result, COST was founded in 1971 to connect the research\nsystems of individual European countries. The Ministerial Conference of 22 and\n23 November 1971 is generally presented as the official entry into force of\nCOST and at which the first intergovernmental agreements were signed."

Once their participation is approved, researchers from\nNear Neighbour Countries\u2019 institutions are eligible to participate in the COST\nAction on the same basis as the COST Members that have signed the Memorandum\nof Understanding (MoU) \u2013 with the exception of the right to vote in the\nManagement Committees or Working Groups of the Action.\n\nInternational Partner Countries are non-COST Members who are not a Near-\nNeighbour Country i.e. any country (worldwide) that is not included in the\nprevious lists. Once their participation is approved, researchers from\nInternational Partner Countries can participate in the Management Committee\nmeetings as Observers, with no voting rights. Researchers connected to\ninstitutions from International Partner Countries whose participation in a\nCOST Action has been approved are not eligible for reimbursement. Currently,\nSouth Africa is a COST Partner Country."

A huge variety of topics can be covered in\nCOST Actions, including established research areas like history, biology,\necology, astronomy, criminal justice, but also newly emerging areas like\nsystems biology, renewable energy, sustainable architecture or behavioural\neconomics. Actions can adapt as science advances."

Since\n1971, COST has been receiving EU funding under the various research and\ninnovation framework programmes, such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe.\n\nCOST provides funding for a period of four years which is used for organising\nmeetings, workshops, conferences, training schools, short-term scientific\nmissions as well as communication and dissemination activities. This way it\npromotes global networking of nationally funded research.\n\nThe average COST Action support is EUR 140,000 per annum (dependent on budget\navailability) for participation by typically 30 COST Member Countries. The sum\ncovers travel and meeting support."
