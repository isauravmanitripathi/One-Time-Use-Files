The council's\nmain headquarters is located in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The\nCharter of the GCC was signed on 25 May 1981, formally establishing the\ninstitution.\n\nAll current member states are monarchies, including three constitutional\nmonarchies (Qatar, Kuwait, and Bahrain), two absolute monarchies (Saudi Arabia\nand Oman), and one federal monarchy (the United Arab Emirates, which is\ncomposed of seven member states, each of which is an absolute monarchy with\nits own emir). There have been discussions regarding the future membership of\nJordan, Morocco, and Yemen. Iraq is the only Gulf Arab state that is not a GCC\nmember.\n\nDuring the Arab Spring in 2012, Saudi Arabia proposed to transform the GCC\ninto a \"Gulf Union\" with tighter economic, political and military\ncoordination, a move considered to be intended to counterbalance Iranian\ninfluence in the region; however, objections were raised by other countries.\nIn 2014, Bahraini prime minister Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa said that\ncurrent events in the region highlighted the importance of the proposal. The\nPeninsula Shield Force is the military arm of the GCC, formed in 1984."

The members'\nshared vision for regional unity, security, and economic integration led to\nthe official establishment of the GCC in 1981, strengthening the collective\npower and influence of the Gulf countries.\n\nThe charter was signed in Arabic in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on 21\nRajab 1401 on the Islamic calendar (corresponding to 25 May 1981 on the\nGregorian calendar).\n\nThe signatory states on the founding document are the only current members of\nthe GCC.\n\nAn economic agreement between the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council\nwas signed on 11 November 1981 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. These countries are often\nreferred to as \"the GCC states\"."

Following the announcement that the central\nbank for the monetary union would be located in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, rather\nthan in the UAE, they announced their withdrawal from the monetary union\nproject in May 2009. The name Khaleeji has been proposed as a name for this\ncurrency. If realized, the GCC monetary union would be the second-largest\nsupranational monetary union in the world, measured by the GDP of the common-\ncurrency area, following the Eurozone.\n\nOther stated objectives include:\n\n* Formulating similar regulations in various fields such as religion, finance, trade, customs, tourism, legislation, and administration.\n* Fostering scientific and technical progress in industry, mining, agriculture, water, and animal resources.\n* Establishing scientific research centers.\n* Setting up joint ventures.\n* Unified military (Peninsula Shield Force).\n* Encouraging cooperation of the private sector.\n* Strengthening ties between their people.\n\nPresident Obama, CIA Director Brennan, and King Salman of Saudi Arabia at the\nGCC\u2013US Summit in Riyadh on 21 April 2016\n\nThe area has some of the fastest-growing economies in the world, mostly due to\na boom in oil and natural gas revenues coupled with a building and investment\nboom backed by decades of saved petroleum revenues. In an effort to build a\ntax base and economic foundation before the reserves run out, the UAE's\ninvestment arms, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, retain over US$900\nbillion in assets. Other regional funds have several hundreds of billions of\ndollars of assets under management.\n\nThe region is an emerging hotspot for events, including the 2006 Asian Games\nin Doha, Qatar. Doha also submitted an unsuccessful application for the 2016\nSummer Olympics. Qatar would later host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\n\nRecovery plans have been criticized for crowding out the private sector,\nfailing to set clear priorities for growth, failing to restore weak consumer\nand investor confidence, and undermining long-term stability."

A water interconnection project has been\ndiscussed but, as of January 2023, there have been no notable developments.\nUnlike other leading aviation regions like the European Union, members have\nnot agreed to an open skies policy. As such, GCC airlines do not have\nunlimited market access rights to member states and compete to capture\ninternational air traffic flows.\n\nThe GCC has also launched major rail projects to connect the peninsula. The\nrailways are expected to fuel intra-regional trade while helping reduce fuel\nconsumption. Over US$200 billion will be invested to develop about 40,000\nkilometres (25,000 mi) of rail network across the GCC, according to Oman's\nMinister of Transport and Communications. According to Ramiz Al Assar,\nResident World Bank advisor for the GCC, it will link the six member states as\na regional transport corridor, further integrating with the national railway\nprojects, deepening economic social and political integration, and it is\ndeveloped from a sustainable perspective.\n\nThe project, estimated to be worth $15.5 billion, was scheduled to be\ncompleted by 2021. As of May 2022, railway construction UAE and Saudi Arabia\nhave progressed significantly, but other members' efforts have lagged. Saudi\nArabian Railways, Etihad Rail, and their respective national governments have\ninvested 15 billion dollars as of early 2015 into railway infrastructure to\ncreate rail networks for transporting freight, connecting cities, and reducing\ntransport times.\n\nIn the banking industry of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), diversity is\nincreasingly recognized as a strategic asset that goes beyond mere corporate\nsocial responsibility. This shift towards embracing a diverse workforce is\ndriven by the recognition that varied perspectives and experiences spur\ninnovation, improve decision-making, and expand market reach in the fast-paced\nworld of finance, increasing market share and profitability."

These tensions came to a\nhead during a March 2014 meeting of the GCC, after which the UAE, Saudi Arabia\nand Bahrain recalled their ambassadors to Qatar.\n\nSome financial economists have interpreted the 2014 Saudi\u2013Qatari rift as a\ntangible political sign of a growing economic rivalry between oil and natural\ngas producers, which could \"have deep and long-lasting consequences\" beyond\nMENA."

        "generated_section_content_md": "On 5 June 2017, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt had officially cut\ndiplomatic ties with Qatar. Saudi Arabia said it took the decision to cut\ndiplomatic ties due to Qatar's \"embrace of various terrorist and sectarian\ngroups aimed at destabilising the region\", including the Muslim Brotherhood,\nal-Qaeda, ISIL and Iran-supported groups in Saudi Arabia's eastern province of\nQatif. Political researcher Islam Hassan viewed this rift as a continuation of\nQatar's foreign policy rivalry with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nIn June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain put a ban on\nQataris and their businesses. Qataris were not allowed to enter or live in\nSaudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, or Bahrain, unless they had a spouse\nliving there, in which case they were required to carry a visa in order to\nenter these countries. Qatar Airways aircraft were not allowed to fly over\nthese countries. Saudi Arabia stated that they would turn its land border with\nQatar into a canal, known as the Salwa Canal, in 2018. The plan was abandoned\nin 2019.[_citation needed_]\n\nOn 4 January 2021, Kuwait National TV announced that Saudi Arabia would\nrestore all diplomatic ties with Qatar, reopen air space to Qatari aircraft\nand reopen the Qatar\u2013Saudi land border.[_citation needed_]\n\nLater that evening, it was announced that Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates\nand Egypt agreed to restore ties with Qatar. On 4 January 2021, it was made\nofficial at the Al-Ula summit, where the blockading countries, along with\nQatar, signed an official agreement and ended the rift after three years and\nseven months.[_citation needed_]"
