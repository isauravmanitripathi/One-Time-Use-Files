It was established on 17 May 1865\nas the **International Telegraph Union** , the first formal and permanent\ninternational organization. The organization significantly predates the UN,\nmaking it the oldest UN agency. Doreen Bogdan-Martin is the Secretary-General\nof ITU, the first woman to serve as its head.\n\nThe ITU was initially aimed at helping connect telegraphic networks between\ncountries, with its mandate consistently broadening with the advent of new\ncommunications technologies; it adopted its current name in 1932 to reflect\nits expanded responsibilities over radio and the telephone. On 15 November\n1947, the ITU entered into an agreement with the newly created United Nations\nto become a specialized agency within the UN system, which formally entered\ninto force on 1 January 1949.\n\nThe ITU promotes the shared global use of the radio spectrum, facilitates\ninternational cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, assists in developing\nand coordinating worldwide technical standards, and works to improve\ntelecommunication infrastructure in the developing world. It is also active in\nthe areas of broadband Internet, optical communications (including optical\nfiber technologies), wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime\nnavigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, TV broadcasting,\namateur radio, and next-generation networks.\n\nBased in Geneva, Switzerland, the ITU's global membership includes 194\ncountries and around 900 businesses, academic institutions, and international\nand regional organizations.\n\nInternational Telecommunication Union (ITU) headquarters campus buildings ITU\nHQ background Palais des Nations"

        "generated_section_content_md": "The ITU is one of the oldest international organizations still in operation,\nsecond[_citation needed_] only to the Central Commission for Navigation on the\nRhine, which predates it by fifty years. It was preceded by the now defunct\n**International Telegraph Union** which drafted the earliest international\nstandards and regulations governing international telegraph networks. The\ndevelopment of the telegraph in the early 19th century changed the way people\ncommunicated on the local and international levels. Between 1849 and 1865, a\nseries of bilateral and regional agreements among Western European states\nattempted to standardize international communications.\n\nBy 1865, it was agreed that a comprehensive agreement was needed in order to\ncreate a framework that would standardize telegraphy equipment, set uniform\noperating instructions, and lay down common international tariff and\naccounting rules. Between 1 March and 17 May 1865, the French Government\nhosted delegations from 20 European states at the first International\nTelegraph Conference in Paris. This meeting culminated in the International\nTelegraph Convention which was signed on 17 May 1865. As a result of the 1865\nConference, the International Telegraph Union, the predecessor to the modern\nITU, was founded as the first international standards organization. The Union\nwas tasked with implementing basic principles for international telegraphy.\nThis included: the use of the Morse code as the international telegraph\nalphabet, the protection of the secrecy of correspondence, and the right of\neverybody to use the international telegraphy.\n\nAnother predecessor to the modern ITU, the International Radiotelegraph Union,\nwas established in 1906 at the first International Radiotelegraph Convention\nin Berlin. The conference was attended by representatives of 29 nations and\nculminated in the International Radiotelegraph Convention. An annex to the\nconvention eventually became known as _ITU Radio Regulations_. At the\nconference it was also decided that the Bureau of the International Telegraph\nUnion would also act as the conference's central administrator.\n\nBetween 3 September and 10 December 1932, a joint conference of the\nInternational Telegraph Union and the International Radiotelegraph Union\nconvened to merge the two organizations into a single entity, the\nInternational Telecommunication Union. The Conference decided that the\nTelegraph Convention of 1875 and the Radiotelegraph Convention of 1927 were to\nbe combined into a single convention, the International Telecommunication\nConvention, embracing the three fields of telegraphy, telephony and radio.\n\n1966 documentary on the history and activities of the ITU\n\nOn 15 November 1947, an agreement between ITU and the newly created United\nNations recognized the ITU as the specialized agency for global\ntelecommunications. This agreement entered into force on 1 January 1949,\nofficially making the ITU an organ of the United Nations."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In December 2012, the ITU facilitated The World Conference on International\nTelecommunications 2012 (WCIT-12) in Dubai. WCIT-12 was a treaty-level\nconference to address International Telecommunications Regulations, the\ninternational rules for telecommunications, including international tariffs.\nThe previous conference to update the Regulations (ITRs) was held in Melbourne\nin 1988.\n\nIn August 2012, Neaomy Claiborne of Northern California was reelected for a\nthird term as liaison and legal advisor to the Secretariat General. ITU called\nfor a public consultation on a draft document ahead of the conference. It is\nclaimed the proposal would allow government restriction or blocking of\ninformation disseminated via the Internet and create a global regime of\nmonitoring Internet communications, including the demand that those who send\nand receive information identify themselves. It would also allow governments\nto shut down the Internet, if it is believed that it may interfere in the\ninternal affairs of other states, or that information of a sensitive nature\nmight be shared.\n\nTelecommunications ministers from 193 countries attended the conference in\nDubai.\n\nThe current regulatory structure was based on voice telecommunications, when\nthe Internet was still in its infancy. In 1988, telecommunications operated\nunder regulated monopolies in most countries. As the Internet has grown,\norganizations such as ICANN have come into existence for management of key\nresources such as Internet addresses and domain names.\n\nCurrent[_when?_] proposals look to take into account the prevalence of data\ncommunications. Proposals under consideration would establish regulatory\noversight by the UN over security, fraud, traffic accounting as well as\ntraffic flow, management of Internet Domain Names and IP addresses, and other\naspects of the Internet that are currently governed either by community-based\napproaches such as regional Internet registries, ICANN, or largely national\nregulatory frameworks. The move by the ITU and some countries has alarmed many\nwithin the United States and within the Internet community. Indeed, some\nEuropean telecommunication services have proposed a so-called \"sender pays\"\nmodel that would require sources of Internet traffic to pay destinations,\nsimilar to the way funds are transferred between countries using the\ntelephone.\n\nThe WCIT-12 activity has been criticized by Google, which has characterized it\nas a threat to the \"...free and open internet.\"\n\nOn 22 November 2012, the European Parliament passed a resolution urging member\nstates to prevent ITU WCIT-12 activity that would \"negatively impact the\ninternet, its architecture, operations, content and security, business\nrelations, internet governance and the free flow of information online\". The\nresolution asserted that \"the ITU [...] is not the appropriate body to assert\nregulatory authority over the internet\".\n\nOn 5 December 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed a\nresolution opposing UN governance of the Internet by a rare unanimous 397\u20130\nvote. The resolution warned that \"... proposals have been put forward for\nconsideration at the [WCIT-12] that would fundamentally alter the governance\nand operation of the Internet ... [and] would attempt to justify increased\ngovernment control over the Internet ...\", and stated that the policy of the\nUnited States is \"... to promote a global Internet free from government\ncontrol and preserve and advance the successful Multistakeholder Model that\ngoverns the Internet today.\" The same resolution had previously been passed\nunanimously by the United States Senate in September.\n\nOn 14 December 2012, an amended version of the Regulations was signed by 89 of\nthe 152 countries. Countries that did not sign included the United States,\nJapan, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, India and the United Kingdom. The\nhead of the U.S. delegation, Terry Kramer, said \"We cannot support a treaty\nthat is not supportive of the multistakeholder model of Internet governance\".\nThe disagreement appeared to be over some language in the revised ITRs\nreferring to ITU roles in addressing unsolicited bulk communications, network\nsecurity, and a resolution on Internet governance that called for government\nparticipation in Internet topics at various ITU forums. Despite the\nsignificant number countries not signing, the ITU came out with a press\nrelease: \"New global telecoms treaty agreed in Dubai\"."

The sectors were created\nduring the restructuring of ITU at the additional 1992 ITU Plenipotentiary\nConference.\n\nRadio communication (ITU-R)\n\nEstablished in 1927 as the International Radio Consultative Committee or CCIR (from its French name __Comit\u00e9 consultatif international pour la radio__), this sector manages the international radio-frequency spectrum and satellite orbit resources. In 1992, the CCIR became the ITU-R. The secretariat is the Radiocommunication Bureau, headed by Director Mario Maniewicz.\nStandardization (ITU-T)\n\nStandardization has been the original purpose of ITU since its inception. Established in 1956 as the International Telephone and Telegraph Consultative Committee, or CCITT (from its French name __Comit\u00e9 consultatif international t\u00e9l\u00e9phonique et t\u00e9l\u00e9graphique__), this sector standardizes global telecommunications (except for radio). In 1993, the CCITT became the ITU-T. The standardization work is undertaken by study groups, including Study Group 13 on Networks and Study Group 16 on Multimedia, and Study Group 17 on Security. The parent body of the study groups is the quadrennial World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly. New work areas can be developed in focus groups, such as the ITU-WHO Focus Group on Artificial Intelligence for Health. The secretariat is the Telecommunication Standardization Bureau, headed by Director Seizo Onoe.\nDevelopment (ITU-D)\n\nEstablished in 1992, this sector helps spread equitable, sustainable and affordable access to information and communication technologies (ICT). It also provides the Secretariat for the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development and the Partner2Connect Digital Alliance.\n\nA permanent General Secretariat, headed by the Secretary General, manages the\nday-to-day work of the ITU and its sectors."
