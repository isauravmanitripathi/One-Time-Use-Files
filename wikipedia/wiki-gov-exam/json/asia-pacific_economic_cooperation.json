Following the success\nof ASEAN's series of post-ministerial conferences launched in the mid-1980s,\nAPEC started in 1989, in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-\nPacific economies and the advent of regional trade blocs in other parts of the\nworld; it aimed to establish new markets for agricultural products and raw\nmaterials beyond Europe. Headquartered in Singapore, APEC is recognized as one\nof the highest-level multilateral blocs and oldest forums in the Asia-Pacific\n/ Americas region, and exerts significant global influence.\n\nThe heads of government of all APEC members except Taiwan (which is\nrepresented by a ministerial-level official as _economic leader_) attend an\nannual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. The location of the meeting rotates\nannually among the member economies, and a famous tradition, followed for most\n(but not all) summits, involves the attending leaders dressing in a national\ncostume of the host country. APEC has three official observers: the\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat, the Pacific Economic\nCooperation Council and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. APEC's Host\nEconomy of the Year is considered to be invited in the first place for\ngeographical representation to attend G20 meetings following G20 guidelines."

        "generated_section_content_md": "ABC news report of the first APEC meeting in Canberra, November 1989,\nfeaturing delegates watching the Melbourne Cup\n\nThe initial inspiration for APEC came when the Association of Southeast Asian\nNations (ASEAN)'s series of post-ministerial conferences, launched in the\nmid-1980s, had demonstrated the feasibility and value of regular conferences\namong ministerial-level representatives of both developed and developing\neconomies. By 1986, the post-ministerial conferences had expanded to embrace\n12 members (the then six members of ASEAN and its six dialogue partners). The\ndevelopments led Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke to believe in the\nnecessity of region-wide co-operation on economic matters. In January 1989,\nBob Hawke called for more effective economic co-operation across the Pacific\nRim region. This led to the first meeting of APEC in the Australian capital of\nCanberra in November, chaired by  Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth\nEvans. Attended by ministers from twelve countries, the meeting concluded with\ncommitments to hold future annual meetings in Singapore and South Korea. Ten\nmonths later, representatives of 12 Asia-Pacific economies met in Canberra,\nAustralia, to establish APEC. The APEC Secretariat, based in Singapore, was\nestablished to co-ordinate the activities of the organisation.\n\nDuring the 1994 meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, APEC leaders adopted the **Bogor\nGoals** , which aimed for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-\nPacific by 2010 for industrialised economies and by 2020 for developing\neconomies. During the November 1995 Ministerial Meeting in Osaka, Japan, a\nbusiness advisory body named the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC)\ncomposed of three business executives from each member-country was agreed to\nbe established in 1996.\n\nIn April 2001, APEC, in collaboration with five other international\norganisations (Eurostat, International Energy Agency, Organizaci\u00f3n\nLatinoamericana de Energ\u00eda (OLADE) [es], Organization of the Petroleum\nExporting Countries and the United Nations Statistics Division) launched the\nJoint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the Joint Organisations Data\nInitiative (JODI)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "APEC first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the\nAsia-Pacific (FTAAP) at its summit in 2006 in Hanoi. However, the proposal for\nsuch an area has been around since at least 1966 and Japanese economist\nKiyoshi Kojima [ja]'s proposal for a Pacific Free Trade agreement. While it\ngained little traction, the idea led to the formation of Pacific Trade and\nDevelopment Conference and then the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council in\n1980 and then APEC in 1989.\n\nIn the wake of the 2006 summit, economist C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free\nTrade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the\nproposed parties to any agreement at that time. His ideas convinced the APEC\nBusiness Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, ASEAN and\nexisting free trade agreement (FTA) partners negotiated the Regional\nComprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), not officially including Russia.\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without China or Russia involved became\nthe US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing\nin 2014, the three plans were all in discussion. President Obama hosted a TPP\nmeeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.\n\nThe proposal for a FTAAP arose due to the lack of progress in the Doha round\nof World Trade Organization negotiations, and as a way to overcome the \"noodle\nbowl\" effect created by overlapping and conflicting elements of the copious\nfree trade agreements \u2013 there were approximately 60 free trade agreements in\n2007, with an additional 117 in the process of negotiation in Southeast Asia\nand the Asia-Pacific region. In 2012, ASEAN+6 countries alone had 339 free\ntrade agreements \u2013 many of which were bilateral.\n\nThe FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself\nto reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that\nwould considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region. The\neconomic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other\nregional free trade areas such as the ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN + China, South\nKorea and Japan). Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within\nAPEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications\nwith nations of other regions. The development of the FTAAP is expected to\ntake many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations\nbetween member economies. It is also affected by the absence of political will\nand popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.\n\nAt the 2014 APEC summit in Beijing, APEC leaders agreed to launch \"a\ncollective strategic study\" on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake\nthe study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016. APEC\nExecutive Director Alan Bollard revealed in the Elite Talk show that FTAAP\nwill be APEC's big goal out into the future.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership included 12 of the 21 APEC members and had\nprovisions for the accession of other APEC members, five of which expressed\ninterest in membership."

The protesters objected to the presence of autocratic leaders such\nas Indonesian president Suharto.\n\nAt the 2001 Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai, APEC leaders pushed for a new round\nof trade negotiations and support for a program of trade capacity-building\nassistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks\nlater. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United\nStates, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and\ncapacity building. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and\nimplement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade transaction costs in the\nAsia-Pacific region by five percent over five years, and pursue trade\nliberalisation policies relating to information technology goods and services.\n\nIn 2003, Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Isamuddin had planned to attack the\nAPEC Leaders Meeting to be held in Bangkok in October. He was captured in the\ncity of Ayutthaya, Thailand by Thai police on 11 August 2003, before he could\nfinish planning the attack.\n\nChile became the first South American nation to host the Leaders' Meeting in\n2004. The agenda of that year was focused on terrorism and commerce, small and\nmedium enterprise development, and contemplation of free agreements and\nregional trade agreements.\n\nThe 2005 Leaders' Meeting was held in Busan, South Korea. The meeting focused\non the Doha round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, leading up\nto the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 held in Hong Kong in December. Weeks\nearlier, trade negotiations in Paris were held between several WTO members,\nincluding the United States and the European Union, centred on reducing\nagricultural trade barriers. APEC leaders at the summit urged the European\nUnion to agree to reduce farm subsidies. In a continuation of the climate\ninformation sharing initiative established by the APEC Climate Network working\ngroup, it was decided by the leaders to install the APEC Climate Center in\nBusan. Peaceful protests against APEC were staged in Busan, but the meeting\nschedule was not affected.\n\nAt the Leaders' Meeting held on 19 November 2006 in Hanoi, APEC leaders called\nfor a new start to global free-trade negotiations while condemning terrorism\nand other threats to security. APEC also criticised North Korea for conducting\na nuclear test and a missile test launch that year, urging the country to take\n\"concrete and effective\" steps toward nuclear disarmament. Concerns about\nnuclear proliferation in the region was discussed in addition to economic\ntopics. The United States and Russia signed an agreement as part of Russia's\nbid to join the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe APEC Australia 2007 Leaders' Meeting was held in Sydney from 2\u20139 September\n2007. The political leaders agreed to an \"aspirational goal\" of a 25%\nreduction of energy intensity correlative with economic development. Extreme\nsecurity measures including airborne sharpshooters and extensive steel-and-\nconcrete barricades were deployed against anticipated protesters and potential\nterrorists. However, protest activities were peaceful and the security\nenvelope was penetrated with ease by a spoof diplomatic motorcade manned by\nmembers of the Australian television program _The Chaser_ , one of whom was\ndressed to resemble the Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nThe APEC Chile 2019, originally to be held 16\u201317 November 2019 in Chile, was\ncancelled due to ongoing protests by sections of its population over\ninequality, the cost of living and police repression.\n\nThe 2023 APEC meeting was notable for a lack of consensuses of group members\non their stance over the Russia\u2013Ukraine and Gaza conflicts as well as\nconsensus for WTO reforms. The meeting between Biden and Xi was also seen as\nsignificant in terms of reducing tensions between the US and China."

A tradition has the leaders dressing to\nreflect the culture of the host member. The tradition dates to the first such\nmeeting in 1993 when then-U.S. President Bill Clinton insisted on informal\nattire and gave the leaders leather bomber jackets. At the 2010 meeting, Japan\nhad the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional kimono.\nSimilarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC\nmeeting, U.S. President Barack Obama joked that he looked forward to seeing\nthe leaders dressed in \"flowered shirts and grass skirts\". After viewing\nprevious photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in aloha shirts\nmight give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama\ninstead decided it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a\nspecially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not expected to wear it for\nthe photo. Leaders in Bali, Indonesia at the 2013 conference wore a batik\noutfit; in China 2014 Tang suit jackets; in the Philippines 2015 barong\ntagalogs; in Peru 2016 vicu\u00f1a wool shawls; in 2017 Vietnamese silk shirts.\n\n* APEC United States 1993\n\n* APEC Brunei 2000\n\n* APEC China 2001\n\n* APEC Thailand 2003\n\n* APEC Chile 2004\n\n* APEC South Korea 2005\n\n* APEC Vietnam 2006\n\n* APEC Australia 2007\n\n* APEC Peru 2008\n\n* APEC Singapore 2009\n\n* APEC Japan 2010\n\n* APEC United States 2011\n\n* APEC Russia 2012\n\n* APEC Indonesia 2013\n\n* APEC China 2014\n\n* APEC Philippines 2015\n\n* APEC Peru 2016\n\n* APEC Vietnam 2017\n\n* APEC Papua New Guinea 2018\n\n* APEC United States 2023\n\n* APEC Peru 2024"
