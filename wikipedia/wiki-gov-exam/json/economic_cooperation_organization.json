        "generated_section_content_md": "Asian political and economic intergovernmental organization\n\nThe **Economic Cooperation Organization** or **ECO** is a Eurasian political\nand economic intergovernmental organization that was founded in 1985 in Tehran\nby the leaders of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. It provides a platform to\ndiscuss ways to improve development and promote trade and investment\nopportunities. The ECO is an _ad hoc_ organisation under the United Nations\nCharter. The objective is to establish a single market for goods and services,\nmuch like the European Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the\nECO expanded to include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\nTajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in 1992.\n\nThe current framework of the ECO expresses itself mostly in the form of\nbilateral agreements and arbitration mechanisms between individual and fully\nsovereign member states. That makes the ECO similar to ASEAN in that it is an\norganisation that has its own offices and bureaucracy for implementation of\ntrade amongst sovereign member states. This consists of the historically\nintegrated agricultural region of the Ferghana Valley which allows for trade\nand common agricultural production in the border region between Kyrgyzstan,\nTajikistan and Uzbekistan. Pakistan has free trade agreements with both\nAfghanistan and Iran which are in the process of implementation.\n\nIn 2017, a free trade agreement between Turkey and Iran was proposed to be\nsigned in the future, in addition to a proposed Pakistan-Turkey Free Trade\nAgreement. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement is designed to\nfacilitate trade for goods and services for Central Asia via both Afghanistan\nand Pakistan. That is in addition to the Ashgabat Agreement, which is a multi-\nmodal transport agreement between the Central Asian states. Further\ncooperation amongst members is planned in the form of the Iran\u2013Pakistan gas\npipeline, as well as a Turkmenistan\u2013Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan pipeline. Current\npipelines include the Tabriz\u2013Ankara pipeline in addition to the planned\nPersian Pipeline. This is in addition to the transportation of oil and gas\nfrom Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to supply the\nindustrialisation underway in Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and beyond. Pakistan\nplans to diversify its source of oil and gas supplies towards the Central\nAsian states, including petroleum import contracts with Azerbaijan.\n\nThe ECO's Secretariat and ECO Cultural Institute are based in Iran, ECO Trade\nand Development Bank and ECO Educational Institute are located in Turkey, and\nECO Science Foundation is in Pakistan."

In 1985 Iran, Pakistan and Turkey joined to form the\nECO. By the fall of 1992, the ECO expanded to include seven new members;\nAfghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and\nUzbekistan. The date of the expansion to its present strength, 28 November, is\nreferred to as \"ECO Day\". The status and power of the ECO is growing. However,\nthe organisation faces many challenges. Most importantly, the member states\nare lacking appropriate infrastructure and institutions which the Organization\nis primarily seeking to develop, to make full use of the available resources\nin the region and provide sustainable development for the member nations. The\nEconomic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement (ECOTA) was signed on 17\nJuly 2003 in Islamabad. ECO Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) is a new\norganization for trade promotion among member states located in Iran (2009).\nUnder the agreement reached between ECO members, the common trade market\nshould be established by 2015."
