        "generated_section_content_md": "International environmental treaty\n\nThe **United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change** (**UNFCCC**) is\nthe UN process for negotiating an agreement to limit dangerous climate change.\nIt is an international treaty among countries to combat \"dangerous human\ninterference with the climate system\". The main way to do this is limiting the\nincrease in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It was signed in 1992 by 154\nstates at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development\n(UNCED), informally known as the Earth Summit, held in Rio de Janeiro. The\ntreaty entered into force on 21 March 1994. \"UNFCCC\" is also the name of the\nSecretariat charged with supporting the operation of the convention, with\noffices on the UN Campus in Bonn, Germany.\n\nLiving Laudato Si' Philippines intervention at COP 27 Catholic Actors meeting\nwith the Holy See delegation Armen Sarkissian, the 4th president of Armenia\nfrom 2018 to 2022, attends the COP 26\n\nThe convention's main objective is explained in Article 2. It is the\n\"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level\nthat would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [i.e., human-caused] interference\nwith the climate system\". The treaty calls for continuing scientific research\ninto the climate. This research supports meetings and negotiations to lead to\nagreements. The aim is to allow ecosystems to adapt to climate change. At the\nsame time it aims to ensure there are no threats to food production from\nclimate change or measures to address it. And it aims to enable economic\ndevelopment to proceed in a sustainable manner. The UNFCCC's work currently\nfocuses on implementing the Paris Agreement. This agreement entered into force\nin 2016. It aims to limit the rise in global temperature to well below 2 \u00b0C\n(3.6 \u00b0F) above levels before the Industrial Revolution, and even aiming to\nhold it at 1.5 \u00b0C (2.7 \u00b0F). The Paris Agreement superseded the UNFCCC's Kyoto\nProtocol which had been signed in 1997 and ran from 2005 to 2020.\n\nBy 2022, the UNFCCC had 198 parties. Its supreme decision-making body, the\nConference of the Parties (COP), meets every year. Other meetings at the\nregional and technical level take place throughout the year. The Paris\nAgreement mandates a review or \"global stocktake\" of progress towards meeting\nits goals every five years. The first of these took place at COP28 in the\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2023.\n\nThe treaty sets out responsibilities for three categories of states. These are\ndeveloped countries, developed countries with special financial\nresponsibilities, and developing countries. The developed countries are called\nAnnex I countries. At first there were 38 of them. Annex I countries should\nadopt national policies and take corresponding measures to limit their\nemissions of greenhouse gases. They should also report on steps for returning\nindividually or jointly to their 1990 greenhouse gas emission levels.\n\nIt is problematic that key signatory states are not adhering to their\nindividual commitments. For this reason, the UNFCCC has been criticized as\nbeing unsuccessful in reducing greenhouse gas emission since its adoption.\nParties to the convention have not agreed on a process allowing for majority\nvoting. All decisions are taken by consensus, giving individual parties or\ncountries a veto. The effectiveness of the Paris Agreement to reach its\nclimate goals is also under debate, especially with regards to its more\nambitious goal of keeping the global temperature rise to under 1.5 \u00b0C."

The Convention was adopted on 9 May 1992 and opened for signature on 4\nJune 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development\n(UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro (known by its popular title, the Earth Summit). On\n12 June 1992, 154 nations signed the UNFCCC, which upon ratification committed\nsignatories' governments to reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse\ngases with the goal of \"preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with\nEarth's climate system\". This commitment would require substantial reductions\nin greenhouse gas emissions (see the later section, \"Stabilization of\ngreenhouse gas concentrations\"). Parties to the Convention have met annually\nfrom 1995 in Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to assess progress in dealing\nwith climate change.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Convention states that Parties should act to protect the\nclimate system on the basis of \"common but differentiated responsibilities and\nrespective capabilities\", and that developed country Parties should \"take the\nlead\" in addressing climate change. Under Article 4, all Parties make general\ncommitments to address climate change through, for example, climate change\nmitigation and adapting to the eventual impacts of climate change. Article\n4(7) states:\n\n> The extent to which developing country Parties will effectively implement\n> their commitments under the Convention will depend on the effective\n> implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the\n> Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology and\n> will take fully into account that economic and social development and\n> poverty eradication are the first and overriding priorities of the\n> developing country Parties.\n\nThe Convention specifies the aim of Annex I Parties was stabilizing their\ngreenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide and other anthropogenic greenhouse\ngases not regulated under the Montreal Protocol) at 1990 levels, by 2000."

The implementation\nof all six areas has been identified as the pivotal factor for everyone to\nunderstand and participate in solving the challenges presented by climate\nchange. ACE calls on governments to develop and implement educational and\npublic awareness programmes, train scientific, technical and managerial\npersonnel, foster access to information, and promote public participation in\naddressing climate change and its effects. It also urges countries to\ncooperate in this process, by exchanging good practices and lessons learned,\nand strengthening national institutions.

The\nKyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997 and entered\ninto force on 16 February 2005. There were 192 parties (Canada withdrew from\nthe protocol, effective December 2012) to the Protocol in 2020.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to reduce the onset\nof global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere\nto \"a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the\nclimate system\" (Article 2). The Kyoto Protocol applied to the seven\ngreenhouse gases listed in Annex A: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),\nnitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs),\nsulfur hexafluoride (SF6), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3). Nitrogen trifluoride\nwas added for the second compliance period during the Doha Round.\n\nThe Protocol was based on the principle of common but differentiated\nresponsibilities: it acknowledged that individual countries have different\ncapabilities in combating climate change, owing to economic development, and\ntherefore placed the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed\ncountries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current\nlevels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nThe Protocol's first commitment period started in 2008 and ended in 2012. All\n36 countries that fully participated in the first commitment period complied\nwith the Protocol. However, nine countries had to resort to the flexibility\nmechanisms by funding emission reductions in other countries because their\nnational emissions were slightly greater than their targets. The 2008\nfinancial crisis reduced emissions. The greatest emission reductions were seen\nin the former Eastern Bloc countries because the dissolution of the Soviet\nUnion reduced their emissions in the early 1990s. Even though the 36 developed\ncountries reduced their emissions, the global emissions increased by 32% from\n1990 to 2010."

Developing country\nParties agreed to \"[nationally] appropriate mitigation actions context of\nsustainable development, supported and enabled by technology, financing and\ncapacity-building, in a measurable, reportable and verifiable manner.\" 42\ndeveloped countries have submitted mitigation targets to the UNFCCC\nsecretariat, as have 57 developing countries and the African Group (a group of\ncountries within the UN).\n\nCopenhagen Accord and Canc\u00fan agreements\n\nAs part of the 2009 Copenhagen negotiations, a number of countries produced\nthe Copenhagen Accord. The Accord states that global warming should be limited\nto below 2.0 \u00b0C (3.6 \u00b0F). The Accord does not specify what the baseline is for\nthese temperature targets (e.g., relative to pre-industrial or 1990\ntemperatures). According to the UNFCCC, these targets are relative to pre-\nindustrial temperatures.\n\n114 countries agreed to the Accord. The UNFCCC secretariat notes that \"Some\nParties ... stated in their communications to the secretariat specific\nunderstandings on the nature of the Accord and related matters, based on which\nthey have agreed to [the Accord].\" The Accord was not formally adopted by the\nConference of the Parties. Instead, the COP \"took note of the Copenhagen\nAccord.\"\n\nAs part of the Accord, 17 developed country Parties and the EU-27 submitted\nmitigation targets, as did 45 developing country Parties. Some developing\ncountry Parties noted the need for international support in their plans.\n\nAs part of the Canc\u00fan agreements, developed and developing countries submitted\nmitigation plans to the UNFCCC. These plans were compiled with those made as\npart of the Bali Action Plan.\n\nUN Race-to-Zero Emissions Breakthroughs\n\nAt the 2021 annual meeting UNFCCC launched the 'UN Race-to-Zero Emissions\nBreakthroughs'. The aim of the campaign is to transform 20 sectors of the\neconomy in order to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. At least 20% of\neach sector should take specific measures, and 10 sectors should be\ntransformed before COP 26 in Glasgow. According to the organizers, 20% is a\ntipping point, after which the whole sector begins to irreversibly change.\n\nDeveloping countries\n\nAt Berlin, Canc\u00fan, and Durban, the development needs of developing country\nparties were reiterated. For example, the Durban Platform reaffirms that:\n\n> [...] social and economic development and poverty eradication are the first\n> and overriding priorities of developing country Parties, and that a low-\n> emission development strategy is central to sustainable development, and\n> that the share of global emissions originating in developing countries will\n> grow to meet their social and development needs."

Considered the world's largest fund of its kind,\nGCF's objective is to assist developing countries with climate change\nadaptation and mitigation activities. The GCF is an operating entity of the\nfinancial mechanism of the UNFCCC. It is based in Songdo, Incheon, South\nKorea. It is governed by a Board of 24 members and supported by a Secretariat.\n\nMafalda Duarte, a Portuguese development economist, is the Fund's Executive\nDirector.\n\nThe Green Climate Fund supports projects and other activities in developing\ncountries using _thematic funding windows_. It is intended that the Green\nClimate Fund be the centrepiece of efforts to raise climate finance under the\nUNFCCC. There are four other, smaller multilateral climate funds for paying\nout money in climate finance which are coordinated by the UNFCCC. These\ninclude the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF),\nthe Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and the Global Environment Facility\n(GEF). The GCF is the largest of these five funds.\n\nAs of Dec 2023, the GCF had a portfolio of 13.5 billion USD (51.9 billion USD\nincluding co-financing).\n\nThe process of designing the GCF has raised several issues. These include\nongoing questions on how funds will be raised, the role of the private sector,\nthe level of \"country ownership\" of resources, and the transparency of the\nBoard itself. Also, this additional international climate institution might\nfurther fragment taxpayer's money that is put towards climate action.\n\nThe Fund's former director H\u00e9la Cheikhrouhou has complained in 2016 that the\nFund is backing too many \"business-as-usual types of investment proposals\".\nThis view is echoed by a number of civil society organizations.\n\nIn 2023, the Executive Director announced a series of reforms aimed at making\nthe Fund more efficient and positioned to deliver greater impact."

It highlighted the\nresolve, despite all the differences, that we will continue to pursue strong\nclimate action, moving towards 100 per cent renewals and aiming for 1.5C\ntarget.\n\nThe ultimate objective of the Framework Convention contains some key words\nthat are discussed further below and shown here in italics: \"_stabilization of\ngreenhouse gas concentrations_ in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent\n_dangerous_ anthropogenic [i.e., human-caused] interference with the climate\nsystem\".\n\nTo stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations, global anthropogenic GHG\nemissions would need to peak then decline (see climate change mitigation).\nLower stabilization levels would require emissions to peak and decline earlier\ncompared to higher stabilization levels. These lower stabilization levels are\nassociated with lower magnitudes of global warming compared to higher\nstabilization levels.\n\nThere are a range of views over what level of climate change is _dangerous_.\nScientific analysis can provide information on the risks of climate change,\nbut deciding which risks are dangerous requires value judgements.\n\nThe global warming that has already occurred poses a risk to some human and\nnatural systems. Higher magnitudes of global warming will generally increase\nthe risk of negative impacts. Climate change risks are \"considerable\" with 1\nto 2 \u00b0C of global warming, relative to pre-industrial levels. 4 \u00b0C warming\nwould lead to significantly increased risks, with potential impacts including\nwidespread loss of biodiversity and reduced global and regional food security.\n\nClimate change policies may lead to costs that are relevant to the article 2.\nFor example, more stringent policies to control GHG emissions may reduce the\nrisk of more severe climate change, but may also be more expensive to\nimplement.\n\nIn decision making, the precautionary principle is considered when possibly\ndangerous, irreversible, or catastrophic events are identified, but scientific\nevaluation of the potential damage is not sufficiently certain. The\nprecautionary principle implies an emphasis on the need to prevent such\nadverse effects. Following the precautionary principle, uncertainty (about the\nexact effects of climate change) is not a reason for inaction, and this is\nacknowledged in Article 3.3 of the UNFCCC."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The overall umbrella and processes of the UNFCCC and the adopted Kyoto\nProtocol have been criticized by some as not having achieved their stated\ngoals of reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. The UNFCCC is a\nmultilateral body concerned with climate change and can be an inefficient\nsystem for enacting international policy: Because the framework system\nincludes over 190 countries and because negotiations are governed by\nconsensus, small groups of countries can often block progress.\n\nThere has been a failure to achieve effective greenhouse gas emission\nreduction policy treaties since 1992. This has driven some countries like the\nUnited States to hold back from ratifying the UNFCCC's most important\nagreement\u2014the Kyoto Protocol\u2014in large part because the treaty did not cover\ndeveloping countries which now include the largest CO2 emitters. However, this\nfailed to take into account both the historical responsibility for climate\nchange since industrialization, which is a contentious issue in the talks, and\nalso responsibility for emissions from consumption and importation of goods\n(see carbon footprint). It has also led Canada to withdraw from the Kyoto\nProtocol in 2011 out of a wish not to make its citizens pay penalties that\nwould result in wealth transfers out of Canada. Both the US and Canada are\nlooking at internal Voluntary Emissions Reduction schemes to curb carbon\ndioxide emissions outside the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe perceived lack of progress has also led some countries to seek and focus\non alternative high-value activities like the creation of the Climate and\nClean Air Coalition to Reduce Short-Lived Climate Pollutants which seeks to\nregulate short-lived pollutants such as methane, black carbon and\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which together are believed to account for up to\none third of current global warming but whose regulation is not as fraught\nwith wide economic impacts and opposition.\n\nIn 2010, Japan stated that it will not sign up to a second Kyoto term, because\nit would impose restrictions on it not faced by its main economic competitors,\nChina, India and Indonesia. A similar indication was given by the Prime\nMinister of New Zealand in November 2012. At the 2012 conference, last-minute\nobjections at the conference by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan were\nignored by the governing officials, and they have indicated that they will\nlikely withdraw or not ratify the treaty. These defections place additional\npressures on the UNFCCC process that is seen by some as cumbersome and\nexpensive: in the UK alone, the climate change department has taken over 3,000\nflights in two years at a cost of over \u00a31,300,000 (British pounds sterling).\n\nFurther, the UNFCCC (mainly during the Kyoto protocol) failed to facilitate\nthe transfer of environmentally sound technologies (SETs) which are mechanisms\nused to decrease the vulnerability of the human race against the unfavorable\neffects of climate change. One of the more widely used of these being\nrenewable energy sources. The UNFCCC created the body \"technology mechanism\"\nwho would distribute these resources to developing countries; however this\ndistribution was too moderate and, coupled with the failings of the first\ncommitment period of the Kyoto protocol, led to low ratification numbers for\nthe second commitment (resulting in it not going ahead). Before the 2015\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference, _National Geographic_ magazine added\nto the criticism, writing: \"Since 1992, when the world's nations agreed at Rio\nde Janeiro to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate\nsystem,' they've met 20 times without moving the needle on carbon emissions.\nIn that interval we've added almost as much carbon to the atmosphere as we did\nin the previous century.\""

        "generated_section_content_md": "Scenarios of global greenhouse gas emissions. If all countries achieve their\ncurrent Paris Agreement pledges, average warming by 2100 would still exceed\nthe maximum 2\u00b0C target set by the agreement.\n\nThe effectiveness of the Paris Agreement to reach its climate goals is under\ndebate, with most experts saying it is insufficient for its more ambitious\ngoal of keeping global temperature rise under 1.5 \u00b0C. Many of the exact\nprovisions of the Paris Agreement have yet to be straightened out, so that it\nmay be too early to judge effectiveness. According to the 2020 United Nations\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP), with the current climate commitments of the\nParis Agreement, global mean temperatures will likely rise by more than 3 \u00b0C\nby the end of the 21st century. Newer net zero commitments were not included\nin the Nationally Determined Contributions, and may bring down temperatures by\na further 0.5 \u00b0C.\n\nWith initial pledges by countries inadequate, faster and more expensive future\nmitigation would be needed to still reach the targets. Furthermore, there is a\ngap between pledges by countries in their NDCs and implementation of these\npledges; one third of the emission gap between the lowest-costs and actual\nreductions in emissions would be closed by implementing existing pledges. A\npair of studies in _Nature_ found that as of 2017 none of the major\nindustrialized nations were implementing the policies they had pledged, and\nnone met their pledged emission reduction targets, and even if they had, the\nsum of all member pledges (as of 2016) would not keep global temperature rise\n\"well below 2\u00b0C\".\n\nIn 2021, a study using a probabilistic model concluded that the rates of\nemissions reductions would have to increase by 80% beyond NDCs to likely meet\nthe 2 \u00b0C upper target of the Paris Agreement, that the probabilities of major\nemitters meeting their NDCs without such an increase is very low. It estimated\nthat with current trends the probability of staying below 2 \u00b0C of warming is\n5\u201326% if NDCs were met and continued post-2030 by all signatories.\n\nAs of 2020[update], there is little scientific literature on the topics of the\neffectiveness of the Paris Agreement on capacity building and adaptation, even\nthough they feature prominently in the Paris Agreement. The literature\navailable is mostly mixed in its conclusions about loss and damage, and\nadaptation.\n\nAccording to the stocktake report, the agreement has a significant effect:\nwhile in 2010 the expected temperature rise by 2100 was 3.7\u20134.8 \u00b0C, at COP 27\nit was 2.4\u20132.6 \u00b0C and if all countries will fulfill their long-term pledges\neven 1.7\u20132.1 \u00b0C. Despite it, the world is still very far from reaching the aim\nof the agreement: limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees. For doing this,\nemissions must peak by 2025. Recent work \u2013 on the basis of the first single\ncalendar year in 2024 with an average temperature above 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2013\nindicates that most probably Earth has already entered the 20-year period that\nwill reach an average warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, it has been\nsuggested that the global mean temperature may have already passed the 1.5\ndegrees Celsius level in 2024.\n\nThe Paris Agreement also seemed to have influenced the focus of the following\nIPCC reports. Before the Paris Agreement was settled, the IPCC assessment\nreports focused roughly in equal proportions on temperatures above and below 2\n\u00b0C. However, in the 6th assessment report, after the Paris Engagement was\nreached, slightly less than 20% of the temperature mentions are above 2 \u00b0C and\nalmost 50% focus on 1.5 \u00b0C alone."
