IRRI is known for its work\nin developing rice varieties that contributed to the Green Revolution in the\n1960s which preempted the famine in Asia.\n\nThe institute, established in 1960 aims to reduce poverty and hunger, improve\nthe health of rice farmers and consumers, and ensure environmental\nsustainability of rice farming. It advances its mission through collaborative\nresearch, partnerships, and the strengthening of the national agricultural\nresearch and extension systems of the countries IRRI works in.\n\nIRRI is one of 15 agricultural research centers in the world that form the\nCGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, a global\npartnership of organizations engaged in research on food security. It is also\nthe largest non-profit agricultural research center in Asia."

Makiling in\nthe background.\n\nIRRI is well known for its contribution to the \"Green Revolution\" movement in\nAsia during the late 1960s and 1970s, which involved the breeding of \"semi-\ndwarf\" varieties of rice that were less likely to lodge (fall over). IRRI's\nsemi-dwarf varieties, including the famous IR8, saved India from famine in the\n1960s. The varieties developed at IRRI, known as IR varieties, are well\naccepted in many Asian countries. In 2005, it was estimated that 60% of the\nworld's rice area was planted to IRRI-bred rice varieties or their progenies.\n\nA report published by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural\nResearch in 2011 assessed the impact of IRRI's breeding work in three\ncountries in South East Asia between 1985 and 2009. It found IRRI's breeding\nwork delivered an annual benefit of US$1.46 billion and boosted rice yields up\nto 13%.\n\nIRRI, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and BGI (formerly known as\nthe Beijing Genomics Institute) have \"identified the exact genetic makeup of\nmore than 3,000 different families of rice for the first time in what is being\nheralded as a major advancement in rice science.\"\n\nFor five decades, IRRI has provided a place for scientists and future leaders\nin rice research to learn. Since 1964, over 15,000 scientists have undergone\ntraining at IRRI to conduct rice research."

        "generated_section_content_md": "IRRI is pursuing the development of \"golden rice\". Geneticists inserted two\ngenes into the rice plant that allows it to produce beta carotene, which makes\nits grains yellow. Because the human body converts beta carotene to vitamin A,\ngolden rice has the potential to dramatically improve the lives of millions of\npeople around the world, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, where\nvitamin A deficiency is an especially common malady that can cause blindness\nand increases the risk of death from disease. Children are particularly\nvulnerable; according to the World Health Organization, \"An estimated 250,000\nto 500,000 vitamin A-deficient children become blind every year, half of them\ndying within 12 months of losing their sight\". In August 2013, anti-\ngenetically modified organism protestors broke into IRRI's research facilities\nand destroyed field trials of golden rice. The Bill and Melinda Gates\nFoundation supports IRRI in its development of golden rice."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1969, IRRI was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International\nUnderstanding. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is an annual award was established in\n1957 by the trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund based in New York City,\nwith the concurrence of the Philippine government, to \"perpetuate former\nPhilippine President Ramon Magsaysay's example of integrity in governance,\ncourageous service to the people, and pragmatic idealism within a democratic\nsociety\". This award is Asia's highest honor and widely regarded as the Asian\nequivalent to the Nobel Prize. The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation posited\nthat IRRI represented \"the first coordinated international attempt in the\ntropics to solve a major problem of world agriculture\", while also stating:\n\n> Distilling more than three millennia of accumulated insight in cultivating\n> man's leading cereal crop, the International Rice Research Institute, with\n> its creation of \"miracle rice\", inaugurated a \"green revolution\", promising\n> nearly one-half of humanity the prospect of suffficiency in its staple food.\n\nAdditionally, IRRI received the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge\nAward in the category of Development Cooperation. This was awarded for the\norganization's contribution to \"reducing poverty and hunger in the world by\nmeans of rice research and farmer training\", and \"for the quality of its\nresearch work, which has led to the development of new rice varieties adapted\nto different cropping areas in Asia and providing improved yield and\nsustainability across multiple climate regimes\". IRRI was nominated for the\naward by Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. The award\njury also pointed to:\n\n> IRRI's success in transferring the results of its research, by working with\n> local teams and organizations in Asian and sub-Saharan countries and making\n> its varieties freely available to farmers. By this means, the IRRI has\n> secured the effective dissemination of its innovations with the resultant\n> increase in production of this basic crop."
