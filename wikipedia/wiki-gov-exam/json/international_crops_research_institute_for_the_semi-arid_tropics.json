It was founded in 1972\nby a consortium of organisations convened by the Ford- and the Rockefeller-\nfoundations. Its charter was signed by the FAO and the UNDP.\n\nSince its inception, host country India has granted a special status to\nICRISAT as a UN Organization operating in the Indian territory making it\neligible for special immunities and tax privileges.\n\nICRISAT is managed by a full-time Director General functioning under the\noverall guidance of an international Governing Board. The current Director\nGeneral, Dr Himanshu Pathak, who took the post on 06 March 2025. The current\nchairman of the Board is Cathy Reade"

In general, the historical average annual rainfall in the SAT is\nbelow 700 millimetres (28 in). In agricultural policy terms, this region is\nconsidered to be a less favored area (LFA)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "With almost 50 years of experience addressing the agricultural constraints in\nthe drylands of Africa and Asia, ICRISAT has developed key strengths which are\nfocused on delivering impact in the drylands in alignment with its mission and\nmandate. ICRISAT has a unique role in dryland agriculture research for\ndevelopment, working through diverse partnerships across Asia and Africa.\nICRISAT\u2019s unique comparative strength has been to conduct upstream science and\nto translate upstream science to applied research. This makes a difference in\nfarmers' lives by scaling scientific innovations with due attention to the\nenvironment, policy, marketing and socioeconomics. In the complex farming\nsystems of the drylands where ICRISAT mandate crops including grain legumes\nand dryland cereals are grown, integrated solutions are needed to address the\nchallenges of poverty, climate change, nutrition and sustainability of natural\nresources.\n\nICRISAT founded the Smart Food initiative in 2013 with the Vision to create a\nworld where food is 'Smart' \u2013 good for you, the planet and the farmer. A key\nobjective is to diversify staples across Africa and Asia, with the initial\nfocus on millets and sorghum."

The collection has over\n128,446 germplasm accessions assembled from 144 countries. Several landraces\nnow conserved in the ICRISAT genebank have disappeared from their natural\nhabitats in Africa and Asia."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Most of ICRISAT's crop improvement research is directed to deliver climate-\nresilient improved crop varieties with pest and disease resistance, improved\nnutritional quality and market preferred traits and improved genetic gains.\n\nBased on an econometric analysis of time-series data for three different types\nof agricultural areas (irrigated, high-potential rainfed, and low-potential\nrainfed), non-ICRISAT experts found more favorable marginal returns (measured\nas Indian rupees of agricultural production per additional hectare planted to\nmodern varieties) for crop improvement research in low-potential rainfed areas\nthan in either high-potential rainfed areas or irrigated areas. Moreover,\nadditional crop research investment in low potential rainfed areas lifts more\npeople out of poverty than in the other two types of areas.\n\nICRISAT-improved chickpea varieties have been widely adopted in a poor tribal\narea in Gujarat, India, with favorable impacts on yields, unit production\ncosts, and net returns per hectare/per acre. ICRISAT's package of improved\ngroundnut varieties grown in combination with improved agronomy practices has\nhad a positive result in the semi-arid tropical areas of Central India.\n\nTwo major science-based breakthroughs attributed to crop improvement research\nat ICRISAT relate to pearl millet and pigeonpea. A team of researchers at\nICRISAT have released the first public sector-bred, marker-assisted bred\nhybrid pearl millet, HHB 67. This was released in India in 2006. It is\nassessed to have superior agronomic performance and improved tolerance to\nterminal drought. The first-ever release of a hybrid pigeonpea by ICRISAT\nresearchers has been reported in 2008."
