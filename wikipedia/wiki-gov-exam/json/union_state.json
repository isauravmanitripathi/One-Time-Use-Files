Although it consists of only Russia and Belarus,\nother countries are allowed to join. The supranational union is ruled through\nthe Supreme State Council and other governing bodies. As of 2025, the current\npresident of the Supreme State Council of the Union is Alexander Lukashenko,\nwho has held the position since 2000. The present goal of the Union State\nmainly focuses on economic integration, taxation, and integration of defence\nand intelligence apparatus."

The\nbasis of the union was strengthened on 2 April 1997 with the signing of the\n\"Treaty on the Union between Belarus and Russia\", at which time its name was\nchanged to the _Union of Belarus and Russia_.\n\nSeveral further agreements were signed on 25 December 1998, with the intention\nof providing greater political, economic and social integration.\n\nNevertheless, the nature of the political entity remained vague. Under\npressure from his political opponents, who argued for a reunion of the two\nstates, and from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who sought to tie\nhis excessively weak economy to Russia's stronger one, Russian President Boris\nYeltsin initiated the creation of the Union to harmonize the political and\neconomic differences between the two countries. According to some observers,\nLukashenko's intention was also to gain great power, becoming president of a\nfuture Russia-Belarus federation after Yeltsin's demise due to his all-time\nlow popularity. However, after Yeltsin resigned, Vladimir Putin was elected in\n2000 to succeed him as Russian president. There was also the Freedom March, a\n1999 protest against unification in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. Putin's\nelection and the Freedom March forced Lukashenko to cancel his plans and\nmaintain a balance between the independence of Belarus and Putin's increasing\npressure for further integration of the two countries into the Union State.\n\nThe _Treaty on the Creation of a Union State of Russia and Belarus_ was signed\non 8 December 1999. The intention was to achieve a federation like the Soviet\nUnion, with a common head of state, legislature, flag, coat of arms, anthem,\nconstitution, army, citizenship and currency. The Union was ratified by the\nRussian State Duma on 22 December 1999 and the National Assembly of Belarus on\n26 January 2000. On the latter date the Treaty and the Union came into effect.\n\nThen Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev had put forward a similar proposal\nin 1994, envisioning the founding of a Eurasian union, but this proposal was\nnot adopted until 29 May 2014 with the formation of the Eurasian Economic\nUnion."

In April 2025, the newly-elected Mayor of the second-largest city of Gyumri from the Communist Party Vardan Ghukasyan supported joining the Union State.\n* Kazakhstan had expressed interest in forming a separate customs union with Russia and Belarus by 2010. This Customs Union was formed as planned at the beginning of 2010. Kazakhstan has mentioned that it may join the Union State after some time. In late May 2023, however, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declined an offer by President Alexander Lukashenko to join the union, referring to it as a \"joke.\"\n* Kyrgyzstan: As of June 2007, opposition in Kyrgyzstan, which has been locked in political turmoil, had initiated a nationwide referendum to join the union of Russia and Belarus.\n* Moldova: In 2001, president of Moldova Vladimir Voronin announced right after his election that he had plans for Moldova to join the Union of Russia and Belarus. The coming to power of the Alliance for European Integration at the 2009 Moldovan elections has since shifted Moldovan interest towards the European Union.\n* Transnistria: in the Transnistrian referendum of 2006, the government said 97.2% of the population voted for the integration of the unrecognized state of Transnistria into Russia, which analysts say indicates a possibility that Transnistria might unilaterally ask to join the Union, once it is established. Already in spring 1998, 66.5% of Transnistrian voters supported joining the Union of Russia and Belarus in a non-binding referendum by the Transnistrian state. However, not being recognised by either member, this is unlikely to happen in the near future.\n* Ukraine: In response to speculation about Ukraine joining the Union, then-president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, declared that Ukraine is an independent sovereign state and this is not something that can be questioned by anyone in the government. The issue is to be reconsidered in the new light of the Revolution of Dignity and the developments of the Euromaidan movement seeking for the integration into the European Union. During the term of office of the fifth President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, the Constitution of Ukraine in 2019 was amended to consolidate the irreversibility of Ukraine's course to join the European Union and NATO after the events of the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. In 2021, the sixth president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stated that the creation of a \"true union state\" between Belarus and Russia is a real danger for Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that continues today.\n* Novorossiya: During the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliev of the Russian-annexed Republic of Crimea expressed the hope that southeastern Ukraine would form a \"Ukrainian Federation\" and join the Union State. However, only the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic broke away from Ukraine, and the confederate Novorossiya political project was frozen at the start of 2015.\n* FR Yugoslavia/ Serbia: On April 12, 1999, the Federal Assembly of the FR Yugoslavia passed the Decision on the accession of the FRY to the Union state of Russia and Belarus. The legal successor of that decision is the Republic of Serbia. In 2007, Speaker of Parliament Tomislav Nikoli\u0107 said during a speech that he wished that Serbia would strengthen its ties with and eventually join the Union State rather than joining the European Union, but he resigned from his position less than a week later. Although Nikoli\u0107 did eventually serve as President of Serbia from 2012\u20132017, Serbia had submitted a membership application to the EU in 2009 and had received full candidate status in March 2012, prior to his term."

This meeting received a considerable amount of media attention\nand raised speculation that a Union State might indeed be the focus of a new\ninitiative by both governments. Of primary interest was renewed discussion of\nthe Union Parliament (which, although planned, was never actually realized)\nand a _Union State Constitutional Act_ , an instrument which could strengthen\nthe authority of the Union. According to State Secretary Borodin, five\nvariants of this Act were discussed at the meeting, each of which would\ninvolve a 7 to 10 year transitional period in the Union's development. Trade\nand energy issues were also discussed.\n\nOn 27 May 2008, President Lukashenko, acting in his capacity as Chairman of\nthe Supreme State Council named then Russian Prime Minister and current\nPresident Putin Chairman of the Council of Ministers. This move raised\nspeculation that the Union was about to undergo a significant political\ntransformation. However, the most visible and arguably important official in\nthe Union has been the State Secretary, who runs the Union State's day-to-day\noperations. In the same meeting, State Secretary Borodin announced that the\n2009 Union State budget would total 6\u20137 billion roubles, an increase of over 2\nbillion roubles from 2008.\n\nOn 1 August 2011, Putin stated he supported a union of Russia, Belarus, and\npossibly South Ossetia. Belarusian Foreign Minister spokesman Andrei Savinykh\nrejected the idea, as did Dmitri Medojev, South Ossetia's ambassador to\nMoscow, who stated \"Our people voted for independence in a referendum in 2006\nand they do not relish the idea of becoming part of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nSince 2015, focus on developing relations between former members of the Soviet\nUnion is on continued development of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU),\nitself a further development of the Eurasian Customs Union established in\n2010. It is modelled on the integration of the European Union and comprises 5\nmember states: Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. Tajikistan\nhas also expressed an interest in joining.[_citation needed_] However, the\nEAEU is only an economic union, and at present, political integration remains\nwithin the remit of the Union State.\n\nDeeper economic integration is proposed in 2021 within current talks of member\nstates. In November 2021, Russia and Belarus signed an agreement to provide\nfor common policies on taxation, banking, industry, agriculture, and energy."
