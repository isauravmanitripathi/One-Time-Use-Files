It is the place where\nMember States willing to develop capabilities in cooperation do so. It is also\na key facilitator in developing the capabilities necessary to underpin the\nCommon Security and Defence Policy of the Union."

Its work is a continuation of the work of the\nWestern European Armaments Organization (WEAO) and the Western European\nArmaments Group (WEAG) \u2013 it effectively represents the transference of their\nfunctions from the WEU to the EU framework, and thus continues the\ndecommissioning of the WEU.\n\nEstablished by the European Council in December 2001 following the Laeken\nDeclaration, the European Convention (also known as the Convention on the\nFuture of Europe) was a body intended to include the main EU \u201cstakeholders\u201d in\na major brainstorming exercise about the future direction of the European\nUnion. Its final purpose was to produce a draft constitution for the EU to\nfinalise and adopt. This period saw a renewed impetus for the creation of a\nEuropean Defence Agency.\n\nIn its final report, the Convention working group on Defence laid out some of\nthe foundations of what would become the European Defence Agency we know today\n- although the final name wasn\u2019t there yet. \u201cThe setting up on an\nintergovernmental basis of a European Armaments and Strategic Research Agency\nwas supported by many in the Group\u201d, the official document stated. \u201cThe\nAgency\u2019s initial tasks would be to ensure the fulfilment of operational\nrequirements by promoting a policy of harmonised procurement by the Member\nStates and to support research into defence technology, including military\nspace systems.\n\nA year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EDA set up a project\nfor the _Common Procurement of Ammunition_ , looking at 155mm artillery rounds\nand a longer term project looking at multiple ammunition types, to support\nUkraine and to replenish national stocks. By March 2023, 25 countries had\njoined the project. The EDA also signed an agreement in April 2023 with the\nUnited States Department of Defense designed to provide a framework for\ntransatlantic cooperation on shared defence issues, including supply chains."

All Administrative Arrangements are approved by the European Council.\nThe Head of the Agency is responsible for negotiating these arrangements in\naccordance with directives given by the EDA Steering Board.\n\nThe departure of the United Kingdom from the EU in 2020 (Brexit) saw no\nmention in the EU/UK agreements of the EDA working with the UK. The UK is one\nof the top five defence spenders in the world and its departure meant that\nonly France, alone in the EU, can conduct full-spectrum military operations\nabroad. The UK still maintains a treaty with France for a Combined Joint\nExpeditionary Force whether acting bilaterally or through NATO, the EU, or\nother coalition arrangements. On 6 October 2022, the UK joined the military\nmobility project within the EU\u2019s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO)\nframework."
