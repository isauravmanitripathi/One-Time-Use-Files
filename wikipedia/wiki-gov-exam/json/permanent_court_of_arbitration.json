Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( February 2025)_  \n---|---  \n  \nThe **Permanent Court of Arbitration** (**PCA**) is an intergovernmental\norganization headquartered at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, Netherlands.\nUnlike a judicial court in the traditional sense, the PCA provides\nadministrative support in international arbitrations involving various\ncombinations of States, State entities, international organizations and\nprivate parties. The cases span a range of legal issues involving territorial\nand maritime boundaries, sovereignty, human rights, international investment,\nand international and regional trade. The PCA is constituted through two\nseparate multilateral conventions with a combined membership of 125\nContracting Parties. The PCA is not a United Nations agency, but has been a\nUnited Nations observer since 1993.\n\nThe PCA was established by the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of\nInternational Disputes, concluded at The Hague in 1899 during the first Hague\nPeace Conference of 1899. The Conference had been convened at the initiative\nof emperor Nicholas II of Russia \"with the object of seeking the most\nobjective means of ensuring to all peoples the benefits of a real and lasting\npeace, and above all, of limiting the progressive development of existing\narmaments\"."

Public Hearing in PCA Case No. 2015-28, the Enrica Lexie\nIncident (Italy v. India) Prinsegracht 71, The Hague, a building dating from\nabout 1728, which was the seat of the PCA between 1901 and 1913, when the\nconstruction of the Peace Palace was completed. North Atlantic Fisheries\nArbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Prinsegracht 71, The Hague,\n1910.\n\nThe PCA is not a conventional court, but an administrative organization with\nthe objective of having permanent and readily available means to serve as the\nregistry for purposes of international arbitration and other related\nprocedures, including commissions of enquiry and conciliation.\n\nThe _Administrative Council_ (formally the _Permanent Administrative Council_)\nis a body composed of all the diplomatic representatives of the Contracting\nParties accredited to the Netherlands. It is presided by the Minister of\nForeign Affairs of the Netherlands, who is also a Contracting Party. It is\nresponsible for the \"direction and control\" of the International Bureau,\ndirects the organisation's budget and reports on its activities.\n\nThe _International Bureau_ is the Secretariat of the PCA and is headed by the\nSecretary-General. It provides linguistic, research, administrative and\nfinancial support to PCA arbitration tribunals.\n\nThe third organ of the PCA are the _Members of the Court_. Each Contracting\nParty may appoint up to four persons \"of known competency in questions of\ninternational law, of the highest moral reputation and disposed to accept the\nduties of arbitrators\" for a renewable 6-year term. In addition to forming a\npanel of potential arbitrators, the Members of the Court from each Contracting\nParty constitute a \u201cnational group,\u201d which is entitled to nominate candidates\nfor the election to the International Court of Justice. The Members of the\nCourt (along with the judges of the International Court of Justice) are among\na handful of groups entitled to nominate candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nParties to a dispute may, but are not obliged to, select arbitrators from the\nlist of the Members of the Court.\n\nThe PCA sometimes gets confused with the International Court of Justice, which\nalso has its seat in the Peace Palace. The PCA is not part of the UN system,\nholding observer status in the UN General Assembly since 1993.\n\nPublic Hearing in the Administrative Council Chamber of the PCA in Case No.\n2012-04 (Arbitration between the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of\nSlovenia)"

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the Articles 30\u201357 of the Hague Convention of 1899 the rules of arbitration\nprocedure are outlined. These rules are an adapted version of pre-existing\ntreaties among the states. They were amended in 1907, the creation of a\nsummary procedure for simple cases being the most conspicuous change, and were\nrelevant in the 1920s development of rules for the Court of International\nJustice.\n\nThe first act of parties before the PCA is the submission of the so-called\n\"compromisis\", stating the issue and the competence of the arbitrator(s).\nProceedings are then conducted in two phases: written pleadings and oral\ndiscussion. The Court retires once the debate is over to deliberate and\nconclude the case by a simple majority of votes.\n\nThe decision is published as an award, along with any dissenting opinions.\nEarly Court decisions were countersigned by the arbitrators themselves, but in\n1907, that responsibility was passed to the president and secretary (of the\nPCA). The award is read in a public session in the presence of the agents and\nlawyers of the parties to the case. The decision is binding on the parties,\nand there is no mechanism for appeal."

The distribution of the amounts to be\npaid by the individual Contracting Parties is based on the system in use by\nthe Universal Postal Union.\n\nParties to arbitration have to pay the expenses of the arbitral tribunal set\nup to hear the case, including the salary of the arbitrators, registry and\nadministrative functions, but not including overheads of the organization.
