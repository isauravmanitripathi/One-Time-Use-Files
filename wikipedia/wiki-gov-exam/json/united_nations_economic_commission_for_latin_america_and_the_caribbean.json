        "generated_section_content_md": "A mapping of the ECLAC\u2019s activities to the Sustainable Development Goals (in\n2023) shows that its current work emphasizes four SDGs; namely, SDG 17 on\npartnerships, SDG 8 on decent work, SDG 10 on reduced inequalities, and SDG 16\non peace and justice. In practice, the ECLAC strives toward its own regional\nparadigm, called Global Environmental Keynesianism, which promotes\nmultidimensional equality as the purpose of development. The commission seeks\nto balance the new SDGs with its earlier focus on equality and to better\nemphasize the environmental dimension of economic development.\n\nThe ECLAC has been working on a debt-swap strategy since 2016, titled the\n_Debt forClimate Adaptation Swap and Caribbean Resilience Fund_. This fund\naims to reduce the debt and fiscal constraints for investment in green\nindustries, stimulate growth, promote economic transformation, and expand\nfiscal space for public investment such as for the SDGs."
