Regional\nTrade Agreements Database of the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe **Eurasian Economic Community** (**EAEC** or **EurAsEC**) was a regional\norganisation between 2000 and 2014 which aimed for the economic integration of\nits member states. The organisation originated from the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States (CIS) on 29 March 1996, with the treaty on the\nestablishment of the Eurasian Economic Community signed on 10 October 2000 in\nKazakhstan's capital Astana by Presidents Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus,\nNursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan, Vladimir Putin\nof Russia, and Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan. Uzbekistan joined the community\non 7 October 2005, but later withdrew on 16 October 2008.\n\nDuring the 14 years, the EAEC implemented a number of economic policies to\nunify the community. The Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia was\nformed on 1 January 2010, and later renamed the Eurasian Customs Union. The\nfour freedoms of movement modelled after the European Union (goods, capital,\nservices, and people) were fully implemented by 25 January 2012, with the\nformation of the Eurasian Economic Space.\n\nOn 10 October 2014, an agreement on the termination of the Eurasian Economic\nCommunity was signed in Minsk after a session of the Interstate Council of the\nEAEC. The Eurasian Economic Community was terminated from 1 January 2015 in\nconnection with the launch of the Eurasian Economic Union.[_citation needed_]\nWhile the Eurasian Economic Union effectively replaces the community,\nmembership negotiations with Tajikistan are still ongoing. All other EAEC\nmembers have joined the new union."

The Common Economic Space would\ninvolve a supranational commission on trade and tariffs that would be based in\nKyiv, would initially be headed by a representative of Kazakhstan, and would\nnot be subordinate to the governments of the four nations. The ultimate goal\nwould be a regional organisation that would be open for other countries to\njoin as well, and could eventually lead even to a single currency. On 22 May\n2003 The Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian Parliament) voted 266 votes in favor\nand 51 against the joint economic space. However, Viktor Yushchenko's victory\nin the Ukrainian presidential election of 2004 was a significant blow against\nthe project: Yushchenko had shown renewed interest in Ukrainian membership in\nthe European Union, and such membership would have been incompatible with the\nenvisioned common economic space. On March 1, 2010, the first deputy head of\nthe presidential administration of newly elected Ukrainian President Viktor\nYanukovych, Iryna Akymova stated that Ukraine does not intend to join the\nCustoms Union of Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus in the near future \"Since the\ncustoms union contradicts and will greatly complicate Ukraine's membership in\nthe WTO\".\n\nA single market for the Eurasian Economic Community came into effect in\nJanuary 2012, followed by the creation of the Eurasian Economic Union on 1\nJanuary 2015."
