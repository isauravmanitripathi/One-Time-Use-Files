The EAEU has an integrated single\nmarket. As of 2023, it consists of 183 million people and a gross domestic\nproduct of over $2.4 trillion.\n\nThe Treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union was signed on 29 May 2014 by the\nleaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia, and came into force on 1 January\n2015. Treaties aiming for Armenia's and Kyrgyzstan's accession to the Eurasian\nEconomic Union were signed on 9 October and 23 December 2014, respectively.\nArmenia's accession treaty came into force on 2 January 2015. Kyrgyzstan's\naccession treaty came into effect on 6 August 2015. Kyrgyzstan participated in\nthe EAEU from the day of its establishment as an acceding state.\n\nThe EAEU encourages the free movement of goods and services, and provides for\ncommon policies in the macroeconomic sphere, transport, industry and\nagriculture, energy, foreign trade and investment, customs, technical\nregulation, competition, and antitrust regulation. Provisions for a single\ncurrency and greater integration are envisioned for the future. The union\noperates through supranational and intergovernmental institutions. The Supreme\nEurasian Economic Council is the supreme body of the Union, consisting of the\nHeads of the Member States. The second level of intergovernmental institutions\nis represented by the Eurasian Intergovernmental Council (consisting of the\nHeads of the governments of member states). The day-to-day work of the EAEU is\ndone through the Eurasian Economic Commission, the executive body of the\nUnion. There is also a judicial body \u2013 the Court of the Eurasian Economic\nUnion."

As a result of its status as a sovereign state, the Union Republic\nde jure had the right to enter into relations with foreign states, conclude\ntreaties with them and exchange diplomatic and consular representatives and\nparticipate in the activities of international organizations (including\nmembership in international organizations). The former Soviet republics that\nbecame independent states were part of the economy of the Soviet Union with\nits common technical standards, common infrastructure, territorial proximity,\nchains of cooperation, and common legal heritage. Through the signing of\ninternational agreements on trade, economic cooperation and integration,\ncountries can achieve an increase in the efficiency of their economies, which\nsuffered due to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. At the same time, all\npost-Soviet countries have moved to a market economy, implemented reforms and\nexpanded trade and cooperation with the global economy. Over the past three\ndecades, several negotiations have taken place on proposed integration\nprojects.\n\nIn order to reform the Soviet Union, the New Union Treaty and the draft\nEuropean-Asian Union, among others, were proposed. In 1989, the European-Asian\nUnion was proposed by the co-chairman of the Interregional Deputy Group Andrei\nSakharov, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and with the participation of members of\nthe group Galina Starovoitova (as a representative to the Congress of People's\nDeputies of the Soviet Union from Armenia), Anatoly Sobchak and others.\nSakharov presented Gorbachev (Gorbachev was a chairman of the Constitutional\nCommission) with his draft Constitution of the Union of Soviet Republics of\nEurope and Asia on 27 November 1989.\n\nIn the 1990s, Russia and the Central Asian republics were weakened\neconomically and faced declines in GDP as a result of the collapse of the\nSoviet Union. The member states of the union underwent economic reforms and\nprivatisation. The process of Eurasian integration began immediately after the\nbreak-up of the Soviet Union. When the USSR began to fall in 1991, the\npresidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia of the founding republics signed\nthe Belavezha Accords on 8 December 1991, declaring that the Soviet Union\nwould cease to exist and proclaimed the Commonwealth of Independent States in\nits place."

He proposed the creation of a Eurasian Union of States as a new\norganization completely separate from the CIS. The Eurasian Union of States\nwas proposed as a combination of the economic union and political union. For\nthe first time it was suggested to use the name \u201cEurasian\u201d for an economic\nunion rather than \u201cEuro-Asian\u201d or \u201cEuroasian\u201d. The Eurasian Economic Union\ntraces its history back to Nazarbayev's proposal. He suggested the idea of\ncreating a Union as a regional trade bloc in order to connect to and profit\nfrom the growing economies of Europe and East Asia. The vision would be to\nsimplify the free flow of goods across Eurasia. The idea was quickly seen as a\nway to bolster trade, boost investment in Central Asia, Armenia and Belarus,\nand serve as a complement to the Eastern Partnership."

Originally, the country\npreferred not to pursue economic and political integration. Russian officials\nhave stated that integration with the country would be slow and analysts state\nthat as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan it\nmay persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its\nintegration process when Russia announced it would write off US$865 million\noff debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with\nEAEU member states. According to some sources, Uzbekistan does not intend to\nbecome a full member of the EAEU, due to Uzbekistan's neutrality which is\nenshrined in the country's legislation. In March 2020, Uzbekistan announced\nthat it wished to become a Eurasian Union observer state. In September 2023,\nUzbekistan estimated that it will join EAEU in 2\u20133 years. In October 2024, the\nchair of a parliamentary commission examining the potential for Uzbekistan to\njoin the EAEU as a full member stated that \"our conclusion is that Uzbekistan\nis best served by maintaining its observer status.\"\n\nMoldova, Ukraine and Georgia have been offered by both the European Union and\nthe Eurasian Economic Union to join their integration unions. All three\ncountries signed Association Agreements with the EU on 21 March 2014. However,\nbreak-away regions of Moldova (Transnistria), Ukraine (Donetsk and\nLuhansk)[_citation needed_] and Georgia (South Ossetia and Abkhazia)[_citation\nneeded_] have expressed a desire to join the Eurasian Customs Union and\nintegrate into the Eurasian Economic Union.

Viktor Yanukovych's decision to abandon an\nassociation agreement with the European Union and exclusively pursue\nintegration with the EAEU was a key factor in the Euromaidan protests that\nended his term as president of Ukraine followed by annexation of Crimea by\nRussia. The country's membership in the EAEU was seen by some analysts as the\nkey to the success of the union as Ukraine has the second largest economy of\nany of the 15 former republics of the Soviet Union. With high tensions between\nRussia and Ukraine in the wake of the crisis, Ukraine decided to pursue\nintegration with the EU.\n\nTurkey was extended an invitation to join the EAEU by Kazakhstan's President\nNursultan Nazarbayev on 6 June 2014 but the country prefers to join the EU.\n\nGeorgia's Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili said in September 2013 he was\nstudying the possibility of acceding to the Union, although he later clarified\nthat Georgia's main strategy was still to integrate into the European Union.\nRussia's Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev included Georgia as a prospective\nmember in statements made in August 2013.\n\nThe member states of the EAEU have reached an agreement with China to conjunct\nthe EAEU with the Belt and Road Initiative, opting for collaboration instead\nof competition.

In order to link both Europe and East Asia,\nRussia seeks to develop its eastern regions to increase its access to Asian\nmarkets. Russia's Far East has gained even more importance due to its\nproximity to alternative markets since the European Union and United States\nimposed sanctions on Russia following the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war.\n\nChina's rise as a major trading partner has been cited as a potential reason\nfor Russia's loss of control over Central Asian economies. The union is seen\nas a way to counterbalance China's growing trade in Central Asia and the\nEuropean Union's Eastern Partnership.\n\nAs the trade bloc seeks to profit from the growing economies of East Asia,\nRussia has made steps to develop its eastern territories, Siberia and the\nRussian Far East. However, the development of the Russian Far East may face\ndifficulties due to Russia's traditional orientation towards Europe and the\nregion's backward infrastructure and underdeveloped economy. In 2012 Russian\nPresident Vladimir Putin called for Russia to \"catch the Chinese wind in the\nsails of the Russian economy\". During the same year, a Ministry for the\nDevelopment of the Russian Far East was established and the country hosted a\nsummit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) in its eastern\ncity of Vladivostok. The country also began striking deals and undertook\nmassive efforts to improve infrastructure in its eastern territories. Russia's\npivot to Asia included the important task of creating a Eurasian trade bloc.\nThe countries seek to increase their competitiveness by sustaining domestic\ndevelopment and defending their interests in the region. An estimated 76% of\nRussia's exports depend on resources extracted (or manufactured) in Siberia.\nIn order to transport goods from East Asia to Europe, they must be transported\nthrough Siberia by rail. Hence, the region plays an important role in trade.\nHowever, it remains less developed than Russia's western regions and\nmodernisation plans are ongoing.\n\nIn 2013 the Russian government announced it would spend 450 billion roubles\n(US$14 billion) for the modernisation of the Trans-Siberian and Baikal-Amur\nrailways. Russian President Vladimir Putin called the Trans-Siberian railway\nthe country's \"strategically vital transport artery\".

Projects to\nupgrade stations at the border with Mongolia, China and North Korea were also\nundertaken the same year.\n\nIn 2016, Putin calls on Eurasian Economic Union, China, India, Pakistan, Iran\nand the CIS to join \"Greater Eurasian Partnership\".\n\nSome experts also see the union as a way to curtail the loss of Russian\ninfluence in Central Asia. Russian politicians have voiced their concerns over\nRussia's long southern borders and the challenges it may pose.

The relevant communique was\nsigned by Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping on 8 March 2015.\nWhile the \"linking\" mostly is understood as support for infrastructure\ninvestments, there are ongoing negotiations between the EAEU and China on a\n\"trade and economic agreement\" in order to build \"an open economic\narchitecture without a political component, oriented on business and reducing\nbarriers\".\n\nAs a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US and EU placed sanctions\nupon Russia and Belarus.

The ban was reversed on 1 April 2022, although other\nrestrictions on the trade of foods were simultaneously introduced. On 29 March\na Kazakh government official stated that Kazakhstan would abide by US and EU\nsanctions and would not facilitate any circumvention, despite its membership\nof the EAEU. The official explained that Kazakhstan does not wish to be\ntargeted by secondary sanctions, and instead will be seeking to expand its\ncooperation with the EU.\n\nAs of 2023, negotiations were also well underway with Indonesia and the United\nArab Emirates. Negotiations with Iran and Egypt were almost finalized. The EEC\nwas also preparing to revise its current agreement with China. The current,\nnon-preferential agreement entered into force in October 2019 and does not\nprovide any reduction in duties.\n\nOn 15 December 2023, the EAEU signed a free trade agreement with Iran that\nwill eliminate customs duties on almost 90% of goods. The agreement serves to\nreplace a similar temporary agreement that has been in force since 2019."

This led to mass protests\nagainst Ukraine's president, with the EU supporting a failed political\nsettlement before president Yanukovych fled to Russia, and Russia then\nannexing the Crimean peninsula (following a disputed referendum) and\nsupporting separatists in Eastern Ukraine. In response, some member states of\nthe European Union have sought to find alternatives to Russian gas, while\nothers have voiced their support for the construction of the South Stream\npipeline which circumvents Ukraine. Later the already started construction of\nthe pipeline, under US sanctions on Russia and pressure on EU, the project was\nabandoned. Analysts believe Russia backs the Eurasian Economic Union in order\nto limit western influence in the region.\n\nWestern analysts generally see the Eurasian Economic Union as a way to reunite\nmany of the former Soviet republics. For example, _Washington Post_ author\nAbigail Hauslohner wrote the treaty was intended \"to further bolster\n[Russia]'s ties to former Soviet republics.\" The United States expressed its\nopposition to the Eurasian Union, claiming it is \"an attempt\" to re-establish\na USSR-type union among the former Soviet republics. In December 2012, former\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton claimed \"It's not going to be called that\n[Soviet Union]. It's going to be called customs union, it will be called the\nEurasian Union and all of that, but let's make no mistake about it. We know\nwhat the goal is and we are trying to figure out effective ways to slow down\nor prevent it\".\n\nKazakhstan's president Nursultan Nazarbayev called it \"a hard-won achievement\"\nand \"a blessing for our people.\" Public support in Kazakhstan for the\ncountry's accession to the EAEU stood at 68% in June 2014, with 5.5% opposed.\n\nThailand, Iran, New Zealand, Tunisia, Turkey, and Vietnam are among the\ncountries that expressed a desire to conclude trade agreements with the new\nEurasian Economic Union after the treaty was signed. In 2018, the Faroe\nIslands signed a new memorandum of understanding with the EEU. The MoU is\ndesigned to boost trade and cooperation between the two sides."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Eurasian Economic Union is located at the eastern end of Europe, bounded\nby the Arctic in the north, the Pacific Ocean to the east and East Asia, the\nMiddle East and part of Central Asia to the south. It lies between latitudes\n39\u00b0 and 82\u00b0N and longitudes 19\u00b0E and 169\u00b0W. The union extends across much of\nnorthern Eurasia. Its member states cover an area of over 20,000,000 square\nkilometers, which is approximately 15% of the world's land surface.\n\nThe Eastern European Plain encompasses Belarus and most of European Russia.\nThe plain is mostly mountain-free and comprises several plateaus. Russia's\nnorthernmost regions are tundra. The Russian Tundra is located on the\ncoastline with the Arctic and is known for its total darkness in the winter.\nTaiga reaches Russia's southern borders in Siberia and accounts for 60% of the\ncountry. Towards the Ural Mountains and in northern Kazakhstan, the climate is\nmostly temperate. Southwestern Russia and Kazakhstan are mostly steppe. The\nKazakh steppe covers one-third of Kazakhstan and is the world's largest dry\nsteppe region. Armenia is mostly mountainous and its climate is continental.\nThe landlocked country shares no direct border with other members states. It\nis located in the southwestern part of Asia, occupying the northeastern part\nof the Armenian plateau, and is located between the Caucasus and the Near\nEast.\n\nA large number of lakes and rivers are found in the Eurasian Economic Union.\nMajor lakes include Ladoga and Onega, two of the largest lakes in Europe. The\nlargest and most prominent of the union's bodies of fresh water is Lake\nBaikal, the world's deepest, purest, oldest and most capacious fresh water\nlake. The Baikal lake alone contains over one-fifth of the world's fresh\nsurface water. Russia is second only to Brazil in volume of the total\nrenewable water resources. Of the union's numerous rivers, the Volga is the\nmost famous, not only because it is the longest in Europe, but also because of\nits major role in history. In Siberia the Ob, Yenisey, Lena and Amur are among\nthe longest rivers in the world.\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Union's highest peak is the Khan Tengri in the Tian Shan\nmountains, Kazakhstan, 7,010 m above sea level. The lowest point in the\nEurasian Economic Union is the Karagiye Depression in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan's\nCaspian shore includes some of the lowest elevations on Earth. According to a\n2005 estimate by the United Nations, forests cover 40% of Belarus. 11,000\nlakes and many water streams are found in the country. Russia is known for its\nextensive mineral and energy resources, the largest reserves in the world,\nmaking it the world's largest producer of oil and natural gas.\n\nAccording to estimates, the Eurasian Economic Union's population of 176\nmillion people is mostly urbanized, with Russia and Belarus having over 70% of\ntheir population living in urban areas. In Armenia over 64% of the population\nlives in urban areas. Kazakhstan's urban population comprises 54% of the\ncountry's total population.\n\n* Mount Elbrus \u2013 Russia\n\n* Mountain range \u2013 Armenia\n\n* Lama River \u2013 in the Moscow region of Russia\n\n* Sharyn Canyon \u2013 Kazakhstan\n\n* On the southern shore of Issyk-Kul lake, Issyk-Kul Region \u2013 Kyrgyzstan\n\n* Winter \u2013 Belarus\n\n* A view of Mount Aragats from Aragatsotn \u2013 Armenia\n\n* A view of Mount M\u00f6nkh Saridag \u2013 Okinsky District, Russia\n\n* Lake Ayger \u2013 Armenia\n\n* Lake Servech \u2013 Belarus\n\n* Winter in the Altai Krai \u2013 Russia\n\n* Tian Shan mountain range \u2013 Kyrgyzstan"
