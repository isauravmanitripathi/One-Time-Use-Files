The organization was established in 1966, at a\nconference in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and operates in English, French and\nSpanish. The organisation has been strongly criticised by scientists for its\nrepeated failure to conserve the sustainability of the tuna fishery by\nconsistently supporting over-fishing \u2013 an internal review branded ICCAT's\npolicies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery a \"travesty of fisheries\nmanagement\", and an \"international disgrace\". Conservationists often refer to\nICCAT as \"The International Conspiracy to Catch All Tuna\".\n\nHowever, in recent years the organization seems to be turning around. For the\nmost iconic species within its management, the Eastern Bluefin Tuna, a very\nstrict recovery plan was adopted. It is too early to judge its final outcome,\nbut initial indications are encouraging. In general, ICCAT contracting parties\nseem to have agreed to steer the organization into a direction of relying on\nsound science, insisting on compliance and following a good governance model."

ICCAT is also involved in\nwork on data for other fish species that are caught during tuna fishing\n(\"bycatch\" \u2013 principally sharks) in the Atlantic and surrounding area, and\nwhich are not investigated by another international fishery organization.\n\nBased on scientific and other information, such as fishery statistics and\nstock assessments provided by members, each year the Commission decides on\nconservation and management measures aimed at maintaining target stocks at\nlevels that permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes."

        "section_name": "Criticism",
        "generated_section_content_md": "ICCAT is widely criticised by environmental bodies for having short-term\npolicies that favour fishermen over the long-term conservation of the species.\n\nIn November 2008, ICCAT ignored the advice of their scientists that quotas for\nAtlantic bluefin tuna should not exceed 15,000 tonnes per year \u2013 which had\nbeen determined as the maximum sustainable yield \u2013 and instead set quotas at\n22,000 tonnes. An independent review of ICCAT, commissioned by the\norganisation themselves, concluded that their policies on the eastern Atlantic\nbluefin tuna fishery are a \"travesty of fisheries management\", and an\n\"international disgrace\". Dr Sergi Tudela, head of WWF Mediterranean's\nfisheries programme, said \"Today's outcome is a recipe for economic as well as\nbiological bankruptcy with the European Union squarely to blame. ICCAT's\nstring of successive failures leaves us little option now but to seek\neffective remedies through trade measures and extending the boycott of\nretailers, restaurants, chefs and consumers\".\n\nIn November 2009, ICCAT's scientific advisors announced that a total ban on\ninternational trade in Atlantic bluefin tuna was justified, based on the\ndecline in the bluefin fishery population to less than 15% of its original\nsize. However, later in the same month, ICCAT recommended catch quotas of\n13,500 tonnes per year. This was met by sharp criticisms from environmental\norganisations, and prompted calls for alternative methods to regulate Atlantic\nbluefin fisheries, such as protection under CITES. Susan Lieberman, Director\nof International Policy for the Pew Environment Group said\n\n> Since its inception, the International Commission for the Conservation of\n> Atlantic Tunas has been driven by short-term commercial fishing interests,\n> not the conservation ethic implied by its name....ICCAT's actions and\n> inactions highlight the need to take these issues to CITES\u2014the Convention on\n> International Trade in Endangered Species. The ICCAT fisheries managers have\n> shown scant interest in the long-term preservation of the key resources they\n> are supposed to manage. It is now time to turn to other bodies to seek the\n> needed protections that ICCAT has failed to provide.\n\nThe US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a\nstatement with strongly worded criticism, saying that the new agreement was \"a\nmarked improvement over the current rules, but it is insufficient to guarantee\nthe long-term viability of either the fish or the fishery\"."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In recent years ICCAT adopted a draconic recovery plan for Atlantic bluefin\ntuna in the eastern portion of their range, which led to the reduction of the\ntotal allowable catches from 27,500 in 2007 to 13,400 tons in 2014.\n\nApart from reduced total allowable catches, the recovery plan also introduced\nstrict monitoring, reporting, and control measures. Over the years the plan\nseemed to produce results and recently earlier critics have welcomed the plan\nand the action undertaken by ICCAT.\n\nIn November 2012 Susan Lieberman, international policy director of Pew\nEnvironment Group stated that \"It is encouraging that ICCAT listened to the\nrecommendations of its own scientists and agreed to keep catch limits for\nbluefin tuna within their advice. This decision will give this depleted\nspecies a fighting chance to continue on the path to recovery after decades of\noverfishing and mismanagement\".\n\nIn November 2013 Dr Sergi Tudela, Head of Fisheries at WWF Mediterranean said:\n\u201cWWF congratulates ICCAT member countries for sticking to science again this\nyear regarding bluefin tuna quotas in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean.\nThis is a good sign of the credibility of ICCAT. However, failure to address\ncountries\u2019 failure to comply with rules remains an issue of grave concern\u201d."
