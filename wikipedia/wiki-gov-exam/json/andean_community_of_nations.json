It consists of the member\nstates Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru and aims at the economic, political\nand social integration of these states.\n\nCAN is also a free trade area with the objective of creating a customs union\ncomprising the South American countries. The organization was called the\n**Andean Pact** (_Pacto Andino_) until 1996 and came into existence when the\n**Cartagena Agreement** was signed in 1969. Since the reform by the Trujillo\nProtocol of 1997 it called _Comunidad Andina de Naciones_. Its headquarters\nare in Lima, Peru.\n\nThe Andean Community has 113 million inhabitants over an area of approximately\n3,800,000 km2. Its GDP has gone up to US$745.300 billion in 2005, including\nVenezuela, which was a member at the time. Its estimated PPP of GDP for 2011\namounts to US$902.86 billion, excluding Venezuela.\n\nThe supranational characteristics of CAN are the reason why the Andean\nCommunity is considered the most robust subregional organization in Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Cartagena Agreement of 26 May 1969 is the legal basis of the Andean legal\norder, a supranational legal order modeled on European Community law.\n\nAlthough characterized by greater intergovernmentalism, the Andean Community\nis clearly modeled on the European Union in its basic elements. The Community\nis empowered to adopt its own legal acts, which are directly applicable in the\nmember states and can grant individual rights without the need for further\nratification. Furthermore, Andean Community law takes precedence over national\nlaw. These supranational characteristics of the Community are the reason why\nthe Andean Community is considered the most robust subregional organization in\nLatin America and the Caribbean.\n\nThe Member States drafted a treaty establishing the Andean Court of Justice\n(AGHV), which in its legal effects is partly similar to an additional protocol\nto the AC."

In 1973 the pact gained its sixth member, Venezuela. In\n1976 however, its membership was again reduced to five when Chile withdrew.\nVenezuela announced its withdrawal in 2006, reducing the Andean Community to\nfour member states.\n\nWith the new cooperation agreement with Mercosur, the Andean Community gained\nfour new associate members: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. These\nfour Mercosur members were granted associate membership by the Andean Council\nof Foreign Ministers meeting in an enlarged session with the Commission (of\nthe Andean Community) on 7 July 2005. This moves reciprocates the actions of\nMercosur which granted associate membership to all the Andean Community\nnations by virtue of the Economic Complementarity Agreements (Free Trade\nagreements) signed between the CAN and individual Mercosur members.\n\nEvgeny Morozov argues that the original Andean Pact was motivated in part by a\npursuit of technological sovereignty and independence from partnerships with\nAmerican technology companies."

Please help update this article to\nreflect recent events or newly available information. _( June 2022)_\n---|---\nA clickable Euler diagram showing the relationships between various\nmultinational organizations in the Americas\n\n* v\n* t\n* e\n\nThe Andean Community and Mercosur comprise the two main trading blocs of South\nAmerica. In 1999, these organizations began negotiating a merger with a view\nto creating a \"South American Free Trade Area\" (SAFTA). On 8 December 2004,\nthe Andean Community (CAN) signed a cooperation agreement with Mercosur and\nthey published a joint letter of intention for future negotiations towards\nintegrating all of South America in a Union of South American Nations (USAN),\npatterned after the European Union.\n\nDuring 2005, Venezuela decided to join Mercosur. Venezuela's official position\nfirst appeared to be that, by joining Mercosur, further steps could be taken\ntowards integrating both trade blocs.[_citation needed_] CAN Secretary General\nAllan Wagner stated that the Venezuelan Foreign Minister Al\u00ed Rodr\u00edguez had\ndeclared that Venezuela did not intend to leave the CAN, and its simultaneous\nmembership to both blocs marked the beginning of their integration.\n\nHowever some analysts interpreted that Venezuela might eventually leave the\nCAN in the process. As Colombia and Peru signed free trade agreements with the\nUnited States, in protest the Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez indeed\nannounced in April 2006 his country's withdrawal from the CAN, stating that\nthe Community is \"dead\". Officials in Colombia and Peru expressed their\ndisagreement with this view, as did representatives from Venezuela's\nindustrial sector (Conindustria).\n\nIn spite of this announcement, Venezuela still had not formally completed all\nthe necessary withdrawal procedures. According to Venezuela's Commerce\nMinister Mar\u00eda Cristina Iglesias, the entire process was going to take up five\nyears. Until then, Venezuela and its partners would remain bound by the\neffects of the community's preexisting commercial agreements.\n\nExclusive Economic Zones of the member states of the Andean Community.\nConsidering them, the total area of the Andean Community is 6 573 757 km2.\n\nDuring a visit to Colombia in August 2007, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was asked by\nthe presidents of Ecuador and Bolivia to rejoin the Andean Community, and he\nresponded that he would agree.[_citation needed_] Meanwhile, at that time the\nMercosur's relations with Venezuela were weakening as Mercosur was not\nagreeing with some of the Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's proposals.\n\nEventually Venezuela achieved the full membership of the Mercosur in 2012,\nmaking the Mercosur bigger in number of members than the CAN for the first\ntime.\n\nIn addition to CAN, Bolivia is also a member of the WTO, UNASUR, and ALBA. Its\nattitude is considered crucial to relations between UNASUR and ALBA\nspecifically, says Marion H\u00f6rmann, since Bolivia is traditionally seen as a\nmediator between the Andean countries and the rest of South America.\n\nFurthermore, on 7 December 2012, the Bolivian nation was accepted by the\nMercosur countries to start the incorporation protocols to achieve the\nMercosur full membership in a matter of 4 years, receiving the proclamation of\nan _accessing member_ , and further consolidating itself as a strategic\ngeopolitical nation.\n\n*"
