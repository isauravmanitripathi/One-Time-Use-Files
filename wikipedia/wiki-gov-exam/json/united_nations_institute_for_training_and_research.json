        "generated_section_content_md": "The idea of a United Nations training and research institute was mentioned for\nthe first time in a 1962 resolution of the UN General Assembly. UNITAR was\nfounded in 1963, following the recommendation of the UN Economic and Social\nCouncil to the General Assembly, which commissioned the UN Secretary-General\nwith the establishment of a United Nations Institute for Training and Research\nas an autonomous body within the UN system.\n\nThe creation of UNITAR coincided with the addition of 36 States since 1960,\nincluding 28 African States to the United Nations. That unprecedented wave of\ndecolonization created a critical need for assistance, as many of the newly\nindependent States lacked the capacity to train their young diplomats. Shaped\nby its first four Executive Directors originally from newly independent\nAfrican States, the Institute's vision of training was developed considering\nthe very needs and priorities of recipient countries.\n\nUNITAR commenced functioning in March 1965. The Institute originally had its\nheadquarters based in New York City. In 1993, UNITAR's headquarters were\ntransferred to Geneva (Switzerland)."
