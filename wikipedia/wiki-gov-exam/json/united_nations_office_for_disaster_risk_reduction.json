        "generated_section_content_md": "**1989 International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction**\n\nGiven the increasing concern about the impact of disasters, the UN General\nAssembly declared 1990\u20131999 the International Decade for Natural Disaster\nReduction (IDNDR). Initially, IDNDR was influenced largely by scientific and\ntechnical interest groups. However, the broader global awareness of the social\nand economic consequences of disasters caused by natural hazards developed as\nthe decade progressed.\n\n**1994 First World Conference on Disaster Reduction and the Yokohama Strategy\nfor a Safer World**\n\nThe Yokohama Strategy for a Safer World: Guidelines for Natural Disaster\nPrevention, Preparedness and Mitigation and its Plan of Action was adopted at\nthe World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, building on the mid-term\nreview of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.\n\n**1999 International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR)**\n\nThe International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR) was launched 3 by the\nEconomic and Social Council and endorsed by the General Assembly as an\ninternational framework for responding to the challenge presented to the\ninternational community by the increasing incidence and scale of disasters.\nUNISDR was created as an inter-agency secretariat of ISDR together with the\nInter-Agency Task Force on Disaster Reduction. The UNISDR mandate was then\nexpanded to serve as a focal point within the United Nations System for the\ncoordination of disaster reduction and to ensure synergies among the disaster\nreduction activities of the UN system and regional organizations and\nactivities in socio-economic and humanitarian fields. Further mandates are to\npromote public awareness and commitment, to expand networks and partnerships,\nand to improve knowledge of disaster causes and options for risk reduction,\nbuilding on the Yokohama Strategy and Plan of Action and as follow-up to the\nInternational Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction.\n\n**2002 The Johannesburg Plan of Action**\n\nThe World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South\nAfrica, noted that \u201can integrated, multi-hazard, inclusive approach to address\nvulnerability, risk assessment and disaster management, including prevention,\nmitigation, preparedness, response and recovery, is an essential element of a\nsafer world in the twenty- first century.\u201d4 The Johannesburg Plan of\nImplementation provided UNISDR and the Inter-Agency Task Force with a concrete\nset of objectives for integrating and mainstreaming risk reduction into\ndevelopment policies and processes.\n\n**2005 Second World Conference on Disaster Reduction and the Hyogo Framework\nfor Action 2005\u20132015**\n\nThe World Conference on Disaster Reduction was held in Kobe, Hyogo, Japan and\nadopted the \"Hyogo Framework for Action 2005\u20132015: Building the Resilience of\nNations and Communities to Disasters\", which is currently serving as the\nguiding document in strengthening and building international cooperation to\nensure that disaster risk reduction is used as a foundation for sound national\nand international development agendas.\n\n**2007 First session of the Global Platform on Disaster Reduction**\n\nThe UN General Assembly established a biennial Global Platform on disaster\nrisk reduction to support the implementation of the Hyogo Framework for\nAction, allowing government representatives, non-governmental organizations\n(NGOs), scientists, practitioners, private sector, IFIs and UN organizations\nto share experiences, identify remaining gaps, formulate strategic guidance\nand advice for the implementation of the HFA. Six Regional Platforms and over\n80 National Platforms have also been established as multi-stakeholder forums.5\nRegional Platforms also assess progress but focus on the details of the\nregional plans of implementation and National Platforms act as the national\ncoordinating body for disaster risk reduction.\n\n**2011 Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade\n2011\u20132020**\n\nThe Istanbul Programme of Action (IPoA) charts out the international\ncommunity\u2019s vision and strategy for the sustainable development of LDCs for\nthe next decade with a strong focus on developing their productive capacities.\nThe Programme recognized that the scale and impact of natural disasters has\nincreased over recent decades, threatening hard-won development gains of LDCs.\nIt encourages LCDs to take action in implementing and integrating disaster\nrisk reduction in their national and long-term planning and policies.\n\n**2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development - Rio+20**\n\nThe outcome Document - The Future We Want \u2013 of the United Nations Conference\non Sustainable Development \u2013 Rio 20+ held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on 20\u201322\nJune 2012 contains a section (Chapter V-A) on disaster risk reduction that\nsets a firm foundation for discussions on a post-2015 framework to continue\nguiding nations after the Hyogo Framework expires in 2015.\n\n**2014 Third International Conference on Small Island Developing States and\nthe SIDS ACCELERATED MODALITIES OF ACTION (S.A.M.O.A.) Pathway**\n\nThe S.A.M.O.A. Pathway recognize that Small Island Developing States continue\nto grapple with the effects of disasters, some of which have increased in\nintensity and some of which have been exacerbated by climate change, which\nimpede their progress towards sustainable development. It recognize that\ndisasters can disproportionately affect small island developing States and\nthat there is a critical need to build resilience, strengthen monitoring and\nprevention, reduce vulnerability, raise awareness and increase preparedness to\nrespond to and recover from disasters.\n\n**2015 Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction and\nthe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030**\n\nThe Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction was held\nin Sendai, Japan from 14 to 18 March 2015, drawing 6,500 delegates to the\nconference itself and 50,000 people to the associated Public Forum. The\nConference adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030\n(Sendai Framework) as the first major agreement of the Post-2015 Development\nAgenda, with seven global targets and four priorities for action.\n\nThe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015\u20132030 is the successor\ninstrument to the Hyogo Framework for Action (HFA) 2005\u20132015: Building the\nResilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters. The HFA was conceived to\ngive further impetus to the global work under the International Framework for\nAction for the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction of 1989,\nand the Yokohama Strategy for a Safer World: Guidelines for Natural Disaster\nPrevention, Preparedness and Mitigation and its Plan of Action, adopted in\n1994 and the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction of 1999.\n\nIt is a 15-year non-binding agreement which recognizes that the State has the\nprimary role to reduce disaster risk but that responsibility should be shared\nwith other stakeholders including local government, the private sector and\nother stakeholders. It aims for the following outcome:\n\n\"The substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods\nand health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental\nassets of persons, businesses, communities and countries.\"\n\n**2017 Fifth session of the Global Platform on Disaster Reduction**\n\nThe 2017 Global Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction, held in Cancun, Mexico\non 22\u201326 May drew in more than 5000 participants, among which were policy\nmakers and disaster risk managers. Thousands of governments, international\norganizations and civil society representatives were in attendance. It was the\nfirst time the forum was organized outside Geneva and the global progress in\nthe implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction adopted\nin Japan in 2015 was reviewed. During the forum, Nigerian climate change\nactivist, Olumide Idowu, who was a member of the organizing committee and\nrepresented youth and children, was assigned to lead the social media team."

Build local alliances. Ensure that all departments understand their role to disaster risk reduction and preparedness.\n* Essential 2: Assign a budget for disaster risk reduction and provide incentives for homeowners, low-income families, communities, businesses and public sector to invest in reducing the risks they face.\n* Essential 3: Maintain up-to-date data on hazards and vulnerabilities, prepare risk assessments and use these as the basis for urban development plans and decisions. Ensure that this information and the plans for your city's resilience are readily available to the public and fully discussed with them.\n* Essential 4: Invest in and maintain critical infrastructure that reduces risk, such as flood drainage, adjusted where needed to cope with climate change.\n* Essential 5: Assess the safety of all schools and health facilities and upgrade these as necessary.\n* Essential 6: Apply and enforce realistic, risk compliant building regulations and land use planning principles. Identify safe land for low-income citizens and develop upgrading of informal settlements, wherever feasible.\n* Essential 7: Ensure education programmes and training on disaster risk reduction are in place in schools and local communities.\n* Essential 8: Protect ecosystems and natural buffers to mitigate floods, storm surges and other hazards to which your city may be vulnerable. Adapt to climate change by building on good risk reduction practices.\n* Essential 9: Install early warning systems and emergency management capacities in your city and hold regular public preparedness drills.\n* Essential 10: After any disaster, ensure that the needs of the survivors are placed at the centre of reconstruction with support for them and their community organizations to design and help implement responses, including rebuilding homes and livelihoods.\n\n**Role Model Cities**\n\n\"Role Model Cities\" are cities, municipalities or local governments that are\nparticipating in the Campaign and have demonstrated good practices and\ninnovation in DRR and resilience.\n\nRole Model Cities demonstrate achievements in at least five areas out of the\n10 Essentials in the \u201cTen-point checklist of Essentials for Making Cities\nResilient\u201d. The nominated cities or local governments must show innovation,\nsustained results in measuring and reducing disaster risk, their aims to\ncontinue to do so as well as must be interested to showcase and share\nexperiences. They implemented innovative, creative, inclusive and efficient\nmeasures and action plans to realize strong political will in the field of DRR\nat local level. They inspire, share experience, create learning opportunities\nand provide support to other cities to boost their efforts towards committed\nresilient cities and communities."
