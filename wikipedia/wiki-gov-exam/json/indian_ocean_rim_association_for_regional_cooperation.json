The idea is said to have taken root\nduring a visit of former South African Foreign Minister, Pik Botha, to India\nin November 1993. It was cemented during the subsequent presidential visit of\nNelson Mandela to India in January 1995. Consequently, an Indian Ocean Rim\nInitiative was formed by South Africa and India. Mauritius and Australia were\nsubsequently brought in. In March 1997, the IOR-ARC was formally launched,\nwith seven additional countries as members: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia,\nYemen, Tanzania, Madagascar and Mozambique.\n\nThe flag of the organization consists of the logo on a white background (an\nimage on Wikimedia would be appreciated).\n\nThe apex body of the IOR-ARC is the Council of (Foreign) Ministers (COM). The\nmeeting of the COM is preceded by the meetings of the Indian Ocean Rim\nAcademic Group (IORAG), Indian Ocean Rim Business Forum (IORBF), Working Group\non Trade and Investment (WGTI), and the Committee of Senior Officials (CSO)."

To focus on those areas of economic cooperation which provide maximum opportunities for development, shared interest and mutual benefits\n3. To promote liberalisation, remove impediments and lower barriers towards a freer and enhanced flow of goods, services, investment, and technology within the Indian Ocean rim.\n\nIndian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) has identified six priority areas, namely:\n\n1. maritime security,\n2. trade and investment facilitation,\n3. fisheries management,\n4. disaster risk reduction,\n5. academic and scientific cooperation and\n6. tourism promotion and cultural exchanges.\n\nIn addition to these, two focus areas are also identified by IORA, namely Blue\nEconomy and Women's Economic Empowerment.\n\nIORA members undertake projects for economic co-operation relating to trade\nfacilitation and liberalisation, promotion of foreign investment, scientific\nand technological exchanges, tourism, movement of natural persons and service\nproviders on a non-discriminatory basis; and the development of infrastructure\nand human resources, poverty alleviation, promotion of maritime transport and\nrelated matters, cooperation in the fields of fisheries trade, research and\nmanagement, aquaculture, education and training, energy, IT, health,\nprotection of the environment, agriculture, disaster management."
