It was established in\n1974 and its offices are located in Strasbourg, France (headquarters).\n\nESF Member Organizations are research-performing and research-funding\norganizations, academies and learned societies across Europe.\n\nAfter four decades of stimulating European research through its networking,\nESF undertook a re-alignment and re-calibration of its strategic vision and\nfocus. The launch of its Expert division \"Science Connect\" beginning of 2017\nmarks the next phase of its evolution and has been born out of an\nunderstanding of the science landscape, funding context and the needs of the\nresearch community."

ESF\nactivities were organized around three operational bases: strategy, synergy\nand management. In line with its then mission and strategic plan, the European\nScience Foundation ran programmes in science; programmes to enhance science\nsynergy such as research networking programmes and collaborative research\nprojects for European scientists; along with activities dedicated to science\nmanagement, such as providing administrative services to independent\nscientific committees and other organizations."

At the time, EUROHORCs used\nthe European Science Foundation as an implementation agency. In 2014, this\ninstrument disappeared from the European landscape and has not been replaced\nby any other funding mechanism."
