        "generated_section_content_md": "European research centre in Switzerland\n\nThe **European Organization for Nuclear Research** , known as **CERN**\n(/s\u025c\u02d0rn/; French pronunciation: [s\u025b\u0281n]; _Organisation europ\u00e9enne pour la\nrecherche nucl\u00e9aire_), is an intergovernmental organization that operates the\nlargest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, it is\nbased in Meyrin, western suburb of Geneva, on the France\u2013Switzerland border.\nIt comprises 24 member states. Israel, admitted in 2013, is the only full\nmember geographically out of Europe. CERN is an official United Nations\nGeneral Assembly observer.\n\nThe acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory; in 2023, it had 2666\nscientific, technical, and administrative staff members, and hosted about\n12370 users from institutions in more than 80 countries. In 2016, CERN\ngenerated 49 petabytes of data.\n\nCERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other\ninfrastructure needed for high-energy physics research \u2013 consequently,\nnumerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international\ncollaborations. CERN is the site of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the\nworld's largest and highest-energy particle collider. The main site at Meyrin\nhosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store and analyze\ndata from experiments, as well as simulate events. As researchers require\nremote access to these facilities, the lab has historically been a major wide\narea network hub. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The convention establishing CERN was ratified on 29 September 1954 by 12\ncountries in Western Europe. The acronym CERN originally represented the\nFrench words for _Conseil Europ\u00e9en pour la Recherche Nucl\u00e9aire_ ('European\nCouncil for Nuclear Research'), which was a provisional council for building\nthe laboratory, established by 12 European governments in 1952. During these\nearly years, the council worked at the University of Copenhagen under the\ndirection of Niels Bohr before moving to its present site near Geneva.\n\nThe acronym was retained for the new laboratory after the provisional council\nwas dissolved, even though the name changed to the current _Organisation\neurop\u00e9enne pour la recherche nucl\u00e9aire_ ('European Organization for Nuclear\nResearch') in 1954. According to Lew Kowarski, a former director of CERN, when\nthe name was changed, the abbreviation could have become the awkward OERN, and\nWerner Heisenberg said that this could \"still be CERN even if the name is\n[not]\".\n\nCERN's first president was Sir Benjamin Lockspeiser. Edoardo Amaldi was the\ngeneral secretary of CERN at its early stages when operations were still\nprovisional, and the first Director-General (1954) was Felix Bloch.\n\nThe laboratory was originally devoted to the study of atomic nuclei, but was\nsoon applied to higher-energy physics, concerned mainly with the study of\ninteractions between subatomic particles. Therefore, the laboratory operated\nby CERN is commonly referred to as the **European laboratory for particle\nphysics** (_Laboratoire europ\u00e9en pour la physique des particules_), which\nbetter describes the research being performed there.[_citation needed_]"

They include:\n\n* 1973: The discovery of neutral currents in the Gargamelle bubble chamber;\n* 1983: The discovery of W and Z bosons in the UA1 and UA2 experiments;\n* 1989: The determination of the number of light neutrino families at the Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider (LEP) operating on the Z boson peak;\n* 1995: The first creation of antihydrogen atoms in the PS210 experiment;\n* 1995\u20132005: Precision measurement of the Z lineshape, based predominantly on LEP data collected on the Z resonance from 1990 to 1995;\n* 1999: The discovery of direct CP violation in the NA48 experiment;\n* 2000: The Heavy Ion Programme discovered a new state of matter, quark\u2013gluon plasma.\n* 2010: The isolation of 38 atoms of antihydrogen;\n* 2011: Maintaining antihydrogen for over 15 minutes;\n* 2012: The discovery of a boson with mass around 125 GeV/_c_ 2 consistent with the long-sought Higgs boson.\n\nIn September 2011, CERN attracted media attention when the OPERA Collaboration\nreported the detection of possibly faster-than-light neutrinos. Further tests\nshowed that the results were flawed due to an incorrectly connected GPS\nsynchronization cable.\n\nThe 1984 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der\nMeer for the developments that resulted in the discoveries of the W and Z\nbosons. The 1992 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded to CERN staff researcher\nGeorges Charpak \"for his invention and development of particle detectors, in\nparticular the multiwire proportional chamber\". The 2013 Nobel Prize for\nPhysics was awarded to Fran\u00e7ois Englert and Peter Higgs for the theoretical\ndescription of the Higgs mechanism in the year after the Higgs boson was found\nby CERN experiments."

Based on\nthe concept of hypertext, the idea was designed to facilitate information\nsharing between researchers. This stemmed from Berners-Lee's earlier work at\nCERN on a database named ENQUIRE. A colleague, Robert Cailliau, became\ninvolved in 1990.\n\nIn 1995, Berners-Lee and Cailliau were jointly honoured by the Association for\nComputing Machinery for their contributions to the development of the World\nWide Web. A copy of the first webpage, created by Berners-Lee, is still\npublished on the World Wide Web Consortium's website as a historical document.\nThe first website was activated in 1991. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that\nthe World Wide Web would be free to anyone. It became the dominant way through\nwhich most users interact with the Internet.\n\nMore recently, CERN has become a facility for the development of grid\ncomputing, hosting projects including the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE (EGEE)\nand LHC Computing Grid. It also hosts the CERN Internet Exchange Point (CIXP),\none of the two main internet exchange points in Switzerland. As of\n2022[update], CERN employs ten times more engineers and technicians than\nresearch physicists."

Each machine in the chain increases the energy\nof particle beams before delivering them to experiments or to the next more\npowerful accelerator. The decelerators naturally decrease the energy of\nparticle beams before delivering them to experiments or further\naccelerators/decelerators. Before an experiment is able to use the network of\naccelerators, it must be approved by the various Scientific Committees of\nCERN. Currently (as of 2022) active machines are the LHC accelerator and:\n\n* The LINAC 3 linear accelerator generating low energy particles. It provides heavy ions at 4.2 MeV/Da for injection into the Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR).\n* The Low Energy Ion Ring (LEIR) accelerates the ions from the ion linear accelerator LINAC 3, before transferring them to the Proton Synchrotron (PS). This accelerator was commissioned in 2005, after having been reconfigured from the previous Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR).\n* The Linac4 linear accelerator accelerates negative hydrogen ions to an energy of 160 eV. The ions are then injected to the Proton Synchrotron Booster (PSB) where both electrons are then stripped from each of the hydrogen ions and thus only the nucleus containing one proton remains. The protons are then used in experiments or accelerated further in other CERN accelerators. Linac4 serves as the source of all proton beams for CERN experiments.\n* The Proton Synchrotron Booster increases the energy of particles generated by the proton linear accelerator before they are transferred to the other accelerators.\n* The 28 GeV Proton Synchrotron (PS), built during 1954\u20131959 and still operating as a feeder to the more powerful SPS and to many of CERN's experiments.\n* The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), a circular accelerator with a diameter of 2 kilometres built in a tunnel, which started operation in 1976. It was designed to deliver an energy of 300 GeV and was gradually upgraded to 450 GeV. As well as having its own beamlines for fixed-target experiments (currently COMPASS and NA62), it has been operated as a proton\u2013antiproton collider (the SppS collider), and for accelerating high energy electrons and positrons which were injected into the Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider (LEP). Since 2008, it has been used to inject protons and heavy ions into the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\n* The On-Line Isotope Mass Separator (ISOLDE), which is used to study unstable nuclei. The radioactive ions are produced by the impact of protons at an energy of 1.0\u20131.4 GeV from the Proton Synchrotron Booster. It was first commissioned in 1967 and was rebuilt with major upgrades in 1974 and 1992.\n* The Antiproton Decelerator (AD), which reduces the velocity of antiprotons to about 10% of the speed of light for research of antimatter. The AD machine was reconfigured from the previous Antiproton Collector (AC) machine.\n* The Extra Low Energy Antiproton ring (ELENA), which takes antiprotons from AD and decelerates them into low energies (speeds) for use in antimatter experiments.\n* The AWAKE experiment, which is a proof-of-principle plasma wakefield accelerator.\n* The CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR) accelerator research and development facility."

The LHC represents a large-scale, worldwide\nscientific cooperation project.\n\nCMS detector for LHC\n\nThe LHC tunnel is located 100 metres underground, in the region between Geneva\nInternational Airport and the nearby Jura mountains. The majority of its\nlength is on the French side of the border. It uses the 27 km circumference\ncircular tunnel previously occupied by the Large Electron\u2013Positron Collider\n(LEP), which was shut down in November 2000. CERN's existing PS/SPS\naccelerator complexes are used to pre-accelerate protons and lead ions which\nare then injected into the LHC.\n\nEight experiments (CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, MoEDAL, TOTEM, LHCf, FASER and ALICE) are\nlocated along the collider; each of them studies particle collisions from a\ndifferent aspect, and with different technologies. Construction for these\nexperiments required an extraordinary engineering effort. For example, a\nspecial crane was rented from Belgium to lower pieces of the CMS detector into\nits cavern, since each piece weighed nearly 2000 tons. The first of the\napproximately 5000 magnets necessary for construction was lowered down a\nspecial shaft at in March 2005.\n\nThe LHC has begun to generate vast quantities of data, which CERN streams to\nlaboratories around the world for distributed processing, making use of a\nspecialized grid infrastructure, the LHC Computing Grid. In April 2005, a\ntrial successfully streamed 600 MB/s to seven different sites across the\nworld.\n\nIn August 2008, the initial particle beams were injected into the LHC. The\nfirst beam was circulated through the entire LHC on 10 September 2008, but the\nsystem failed 10 days later because of a faulty magnet connection, and it was\nstopped for repairs on 19 September 2008.\n\nThe LHC resumed operation on 20 November 2009 by successfully circulating two\nbeams, each with an energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV). The challenge for\nthe engineers was then to line up the two beams so that they smashed into each\nother. This is like \"firing two needles across the Atlantic and getting them\nto hit each other\" according to Stephen Myers, director for accelerators and\ntechnology.\n\nOn 30 March 2010, the LHC successfully collided two proton beams with 3.5 TeV\nof energy per proton, resulting in a 7 TeV collision energy. This was enough\nto start the main research program, including the search for the Higgs boson.\nWhen the 7 TeV experimental period ended, the LHC increased to 8 TeV (4 TeV\nper proton) starting March 2012, and soon began particle collisions at that\nenergy. In July 2012, CERN scientists announced the discovery of a new sub-\natomic particle that was later confirmed to be the Higgs boson.\n\nIn March 2013, CERN announced that the measurements performed on the newly\nfound particle allowed it to conclude that it was a Higgs boson. In early\n2013, the LHC was deactivated for a two-year maintenance period, to strengthen\nthe electrical connections between magnets inside the accelerator and for\nother upgrades.\n\nOn 5 April 2015, after two years of maintenance and consolidation, the LHC\nrestarted for a second run. The first ramp to the record-breaking energy of\n6.5 TeV was performed on 10 April 2015. In 2016, the design collision rate was\nexceeded for the first time. A second two-year period of shutdown begun at the\nend of 2018."

Building 40 hosts many offices for scientists from the CMS and\nATLAS collaborations.\n\nThe smaller accelerators are on the main Meyrin site, also known as the West\nArea, which was originally built in Switzerland alongside the French border,\nbut has been extended to span the border since 1965. The French side is under\nSwiss jurisdiction and there is no obvious border within the site, apart from\na line of marker stones.\n\nThe SPS and LEP/LHC tunnels are almost entirely outside the main site, and are\nmostly buried under French farmland and invisible from the surface. They have\nsurface sites at points around them, either as the location of buildings\nassociated with experiments or other facilities needed to operate the\ncolliders such as cryogenic plants and access shafts. The experiments are\nlocated at the same underground level as the tunnels at these sites.\n\nThree of these experimental sites are in France, with ATLAS in Switzerland,\nand some of the ancillary cryogenic and access sites are in Switzerland. The\nlargest of the experimental sites is the Pr\u00e9vessin site, also known as the\nNorth Area, which is the target station for non-collider experiments on the\nSPS accelerator.

Open\naccess, open data, open source software and hardware, open licenses, digital\npreservation and reproducible research are primary components of open science\nand areas in which CERN has been working towards since its formation.\n\nCERN has developed policies and official documents that enable and promote\nopen science, starting with CERN's founding convention in 1953 which indicated\nthat all its results are to be published or made generally available. Since\nthen, CERN published its open access policy in 2014, which ensures that all\npublications by CERN authors will be published with gold open access and most\nrecently an open data policy that was endorsed by the four main LHC\ncollaborations (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS and LHCb).\n\nThe open data policy complements the open access policy, addressing the public\nrelease of scientific data collected by LHC experiments after a suitable\nembargo period. Prior to this open data policy, guidelines for data\npreservation, access and reuse were implemented by each collaboration\nindividually through their own policies which are updated when necessary.\n\nThe European Strategy for Particle Physics, a document mandated by the CERN\nCouncil that forms the cornerstone of Europe's decision-making for the future\nof particle physics, was last updated in 2020 and affirmed the organisation's\nrole within the open science landscape by stating: \"The particle physics\ncommunity should work with the relevant authorities to help shape the emerging\nconsensus on open science to be adopted for publicly-funded research, and\nshould then implement a policy of open science for the field\".\n\nBeyond the policy level, CERN has established a variety of services and tools\nto enable and guide open science at CERN, and in particle physics more\ngenerally. On the publishing side, CERN has initiated and operates a global\ncooperative project, the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in\nParticle Physics, SCOAP3, to convert scientific articles in high-energy\nphysics to open access. In 2018, the SCOAP3 partnership represented 3,000+\nlibraries from 44 countries and 3 intergovernmental organizations who have\nworked collectively to convert research articles in high-energy physics across\n11 leading journals in the discipline to open access.\n\nPublic-facing results can be served by various CERN-based services depending\non their use case: the CERN Open Data portal, Zenodo, the CERN Document\nServer, INSPIRE and HEPData are the core services used by the researchers and\ncommunity at CERN, as well as the wider high-energy physics community for the\npublication of their documents, data, software, multimedia, etc. CERN's\nefforts towards preservation and reproducible research are best represented by\na suite of services addressing the entire physics analysis lifecycle, such as\ndata, software and computing environment. CERN Analysis Preservation helps\nresearchers to preserve and document the various components of their physics\nanalyses. REANA (Reusable Analyses) enables the instantiating of preserved\nresearch data analyses on the cloud.\n\nAll services are built using open source software and strive towards\ncompliance with best effort principles, such as the FAIR principles, the\nFORCE11 guidelines and Plan S, while taking into account relevant activities\ncarried out by the European Commission."

The statue, symbolizing Shiva's cosmic dance of\ncreation and destruction, was presented by the Indian government to celebrate\nthe research center's long association with India. A special plaque next to\nthe statue explains the metaphor of Shiva's cosmic dance with quotations from\nphysicist Fritjof Capra:\n\n> Hundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing\n> Shivas in a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used\n> the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance.\n> The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious\n> art and modern physics."

The\ninitiative provided the essential framework and foundations for establishing\nArts at CERN, the arts programme of the Laboratory.\n\nSince 2012, Arts at CERN has fostered creative dialogue between art and\nphysics through residencies, art commissions, exhibitions and events. Artists\nacross all creative disciplines have been invited to CERN to experience how\nfundamental science pursues the big questions about our universe.\n\nEven before the arts programme officially started, several highly regarded\nartists visited the laboratory, drawn to physics and fundamental science. In\n1972, James Lee Byars was the first artist to visit the laboratory and the\nonly one, so far, to feature on the cover of the CERN Courier. Mariko Mori,\nGianni Motti [fr], Cerith Wyn Evans, John Berger and Anselm Kiefer are among\nthe artists who came to CERN in the years that followed.\n\nThe programmes of Arts at CERN are structured according to their values and\nvision to create bridges between cultures. Each programme is designed and\nformed in collaboration with cultural institutions, other partner\nlaboratories, countries, cities and artistic communities eager to connect with\nCERN's research, support their activities, and contribute to a global network\nof art and science.\n\nThey comprise research-led artistic residencies that take place on-site or\nremotely. More than 200 artists from 80 countries have participated in the\nresidencies to expand their creative practices at the Laboratory, benefiting\nfrom the involvement of 400 physicists, engineers and CERN staff. Between 500\nand 800 applications are received every year. The programmes comprise Collide,\nthe international residency programme organised in partnership with a city;\nConnect, a programme of residencies to foster experimentation in art and\nscience at CERN and in scientific organisations worldwide in collaboration\nwith Pro Helvetia, and Guest Artists, a short stay for artists to stay to\nengage with CERN's research and community."
