It reports not only to the General Assembly, but also to the\nSecretary-General.\n\nThe current head of the OIOS, Under-Secretary-General Fatoumata Ndiaye of\nSenegal, was appointed as Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight\nServices for a five-year term starting on 17 October 2019,[_needs update_]\nsucceeding Heidi Mendoza of the Philippines.\n\nThe office was established in 1994 at the insistence of the United States that\nthe UN take steps to curb waste and corruption, although there are some doubts\nconcerning its effectiveness. Its first head was Under-Secretary-General Karl\nTheodor Paschke."
