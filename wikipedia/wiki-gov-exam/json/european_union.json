The union has\na total area of 4,233,255 km2 (1,634,469 sq mi) and an estimated population of\nover 450 million as of 2025. The EU is often described as a _sui generis_\npolitical entity combining characteristics of both a federation and a\nconfederation.\n\nContaining 5.5% of the world population in 2023, EU member states generated a\nnominal gross domestic product (GDP) of around \u20ac17.935 trillion in 2024,\naccounting for approximately one sixth of global economic output. Its\ncornerstone, the Customs Union, paved the way to establishing an internal\nsingle market based on standardised legal framework and legislation that\napplies in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where\nthe states have agreed to act as one. EU policies aim to ensure the free\nmovement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market;\nenact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on\ntrade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development. Passport controls have\nbeen abolished for travel within the Schengen Area. The eurozone is a group\ncomposed of the 20 EU member states that have fully implemented the EU's\neconomic and monetary union and use the euro currency. Through the Common\nForeign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external\nrelations and defence. It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout\nthe world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade\nOrganization, the G7 and the G20.\n\nThe EU was established, along with its citizenship, when the Maastricht Treaty\ncame into force in 1993, and was incorporated as an international legal\njuridical person[_clarification needed_] upon entry into force of the Treaty\nof Lisbon in 2009. Its beginnings can be traced to the Inner Six states\n(Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany) at the\nstart of modern European integration in 1948, and to the Western Union, the\nInternational Authority for the Ruhr, the European Coal and Steel Community,\nthe European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community,\nwhich were established by treaties. These increasingly amalgamated bodies\ngrew, with their legal successor the EU, both in size through the accessions\nof a further 22 states from 1973 to 2013, and in power through acquisitions of\npolicy areas.\n\nIn 2020, the United Kingdom became the only member state to leave the EU; ten\ncountries are aspiring or negotiating to join it.\n\nIn 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Reconstruction of an early world map made by Anaximander of the 6th century\nBCE, dividing the known world into three large landmasses, one of which was\nnamed Europe\n\nThe place name Evros was first used by the ancient Greeks to refer to their\nnorthernmost province, which bears the same name today. The principal river\nthere \u2013 Evros (today's Maritsa) \u2013 flows through the fertile valleys of Thrace,\nwhich itself was also called Europe, before the term meant the continent.\n\nIn classical Greek mythology, Europa (Ancient Greek: \u0395\u1f50\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03b7, _Eur\u1e53p\u0113_) was a\nPhoenician princess. One view is that her name derives from the Ancient Greek\nelements \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03cd\u03c2 (_eur\u00fas_) 'wide, broad', and \u1f64\u03c8 (_\u014dps_ , gen. \u1f60\u03c0\u03cc\u03c2, _\u014dp\u00f3s_)\n'eye, face, countenance', hence their composite _Eur\u1e53p\u0113_ would mean 'wide-\ngazing' or 'broad of aspect'. _Broad_ has been an epithet of Earth herself in\nthe reconstructed Proto-Indo-European religion and the poetry devoted to it.\nAn alternative view is that of Robert Beekes, who has argued in favour of a\npre-Indo-European origin for the name, explaining that a derivation from\n_eurus_ would yield a different toponym than Europa. Beekes has located\ntoponyms related to that of Europa in the territory of ancient Greece, and\nlocalities such as that of Europos in ancient Macedonia.\n\nThere have been attempts to connect _Eur\u1e53p\u0113_ to a Semitic term for _west_ ,\nthis being either Akkadian _erebu_ meaning 'to go down, set' (said of the sun)\nor Phoenician _'ereb_ 'evening, west', which is at the origin of Arabic\n_maghreb_ and Hebrew _ma'arav_. Martin Litchfield West stated that\n\"phonologically, the match between Europa's name and any form of the Semitic\nword is very poor\", while Beekes considers a connection to Semitic languages\nimprobable.\n\nMost major world languages use words derived from _Eur\u1e53p\u0113_ or _Europa_ to\nrefer to the continent. Chinese, for example, uses the word _\u014cuzh\u014du_ (\u6b50\u6d32/\u6b27\u6d32),\nwhich is an abbreviation of the transliterated name _\u014culu\u00f3b\u0101 zh\u014du_ (\u6b50\u7f85\u5df4\u6d32)\n(_zh\u014du_ means \"continent\"); a similar Chinese-derived term _\u014csh\u016b_ (\u6b27\u5dde) is also\nsometimes used in Japanese such as in the Japanese name of the European Union,\n_\u014csh\u016b Reng\u014d_ (\u6b27\u5dde\u9023\u5408), despite the katakana _Y\u014droppa_ (\u30e8\u30fc\u30ed\u30c3\u30d1) being more\ncommonly used. In some Turkic languages, the originally Persian name\n_Frangistan_ (\"land of the Franks\") is used casually in referring to much of\nEurope, besides official names such as _Avrupa_ or _Evropa_."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Internationalism and visions of European unity had existed since well before\nthe 19th century, but gained particularly as a reaction to World War I and its\naftermath. In this light the first advances for the idea of European\nintegration were made. In 1920 John Maynard Keynes proposed a European customs\nunion for the struggling post-war European economies, and in 1923 the oldest\norganisation for European integration, the Paneuropean Union was founded, led\nby Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, who later would found in June 1947 the\nEuropean Parliamentary Union (EPU). Aristide Briand\u2014who was Prime Minister of\nFrance, a follower of the Paneuropean Union, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate\nfor the Locarno Treaties\u2014delivered a widely recognized speech at the League of\nNations in Geneva on 5 September 1929 for a federal Europe to secure Europe\nand settle the historic Franco-German enmity.\n\nWith large-scale war being waged in Europe once again in the 1930s and\nbecoming World War II, the question of what to fight against and what for, had\nto be agreed on. A first agreement was the Declaration of St James's Palace of\n1941, when Europe's resistance gathered in London. This was expanded on by the\n1941 Atlantic Charter, establishing the Allies and their common goals,\ninciting a new wave of global international institutions like the United\nNations (founded 1945) or the Bretton Woods System (1944).\n\nIn 1943 at the Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference, plans to establish\njoint institutions for a post-war world and Europe increasingly became a part\nof the agenda. This led to a decision at the Yalta Conference in 1944 to form\na European Advisory Commission, later replaced by the Council of Foreign\nMinisters and the Allied Control Council, following the German surrender and\nthe Potsdam Agreement in 1945.\n\nBy the end of the war, European integration became seen as an antidote to the\nextreme nationalism that had caused the war. On 19 September 1946, in a much\nrecognized speech, Winston Churchill, speaking at the University of Z\u00fcrich,\nreiterated his calls since 1930 for a \"European Union\" and \"Council of\nEurope\", coincidentally parallel[_clarification needed_] to the Hertenstein\nCongress of the Union of European Federalists, one of the then founded and\nlater constituent members of the European Movement. One month later, the\nFrench Union was installed by the new Fourth French Republic to direct the\ndecolonization of its colonies so that they would become parts of a European\ncommunity.\n\nBy 1947 a growing rift between the western Allied Powers and the Soviet Union\nbecame evident as a result of the rigged 1947 Polish legislative election,\nwhich constituted an open breach of the Yalta Agreement. March of that year\nsaw two important developments. First was the signing of the Treaty of Dunkirk\nbetween France and the United Kingdom. The treaty assured mutual assistance in\nthe event of future military aggression against either nation. Though it\nofficially named Germany as a threat, in reality the actual concern was for\nthe Soviet Union. A few days later came the announcement of the Truman\nDoctrine which pledged American support for democracies to counter the\nSoviets."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Immediately following the February 1948 coup d'\u00e9tat by the Communist Party of\nCzechoslovakia, the London Six-Power Conference was held, resulting in the\nSoviet boycott of the Allied Control Council and its incapacitation, an event\nmarking the beginning of the Cold War.\n\nThe year 1948 marked the beginning of the institutionalised modern European\nintegration. In March 1948 the Treaty of Brussels was signed, establishing the\nWestern Union (WU), followed by the International Authority for the Ruhr.\nFurthermore, the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), the\npredecessor of the OECD, was also founded in 1948 to manage the Marshall Plan,\nwhich led to the Soviets creating Comecon in response. The ensuing Hague\nCongress of May 1948 was a pivotal moment in European integration, as it led\nto the creation of the European Movement International, the College of Europe\nand most importantly to the foundation of the Council of Europe on 5 May 1949\n(which is now Europe Day). The Council of Europe was one of the first\ninstitutions to bring the sovereign states of (then only Western) Europe\ntogether, raising great hopes and fevered debates in the following two years\nfor further European integration.[_citation needed_] It has since been a broad\nforum to further cooperation and shared issues, achieving for example the\nEuropean Convention on Human Rights in 1950. Essential for the actual birth of\nthe institutions of the EU was the Schuman Declaration on 9 May 1950 (the day\nafter the fifth Victory in Europe Day) and the decision by six nations\n(France, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany and Italy) to follow\nSchuman and draft the Treaty of Paris. This treaty was created in 1952 the\nEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which was built on the International\nAuthority for the Ruhr, installed by the Western Allies in 1949 to regulate\nthe coal and steel industries of the Ruhr area in West Germany. Backed by the\nMarshall Plan with large funds coming from the United States since 1948, the\nECSC became a milestone organisation, enabling European economic development\nand integration and being the origin of the main institutions of the EU such\nas the European Commission and Parliament. Founding fathers of the European\nUnion understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for\nwaging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, a\nfuture war between their nations became much less likely. In parallel with\nSchuman, the Pleven Plan of 1951 tried but failed to tie the institutions of\nthe developing European community under the European Political Community,\nwhich was to include the also proposed European Defence Community, an\nalternative to West Germany joining NATO which was established in 1949 under\nthe Truman Doctrine. In 1954 the Modified Brussels Treaty transformed the\nWestern Union into the Western European Union (WEU). West Germany eventually\njoined both the WEU and NATO in 1955, prompting the Soviet Union to form the\nWarsaw Pact in 1955 as an institutional framework for its military domination\nin the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Assessing the progress of\nEuropean integration the Messina Conference was held in 1955, ordering the\nSpaak report, which in 1956 recommended the next significant steps of European\nintegration."

They also signed another pact creating the\nEuropean Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for cooperation in developing\nnuclear power. Both treaties came into force in 1958. Although the EEC and\nEuratom were created separately from the ECSC, they shared the same courts and\nthe Common Assembly. The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein\nCommission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and\nthen \u00c9tienne Hirsch (Hirsch Commission). The OEEC was in turn reformed in 1961\ninto the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and its\nmembership was extended to states outside of Europe, the United States and\nCanada. During the 1960s, tensions began to show, with France seeking to limit\nsupranational power. Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached, and on 1\nJuly 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three\ncommunities, which were collectively referred to as the _European\nCommunities_. Jean Rey presided over the first merged commission (Rey\nCommission)."

The Franco-British alliance established by the Dunkirk Treaty was _de facto_ superseded by WU. The CFSP pillar was bolstered by some of the security structures that had been established within the remit of the 1955 Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT). The Brussels Treaty was terminated in 2011, consequently dissolving the WEU, as the mutual defence clause that the Lisbon Treaty provided for EU was considered to render the WEU superfluous. The EU thus _de facto_ superseded the WEU.\n2. **^** Plans to establish a European Political Community (EPC) were shelved following the French failure to ratify the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC). The EPC would have combined the ECSC and the EDC.\n3. **^** The European Communities obtained common institutions and a shared legal personality (i.e. ability to e.g. sign treaties in their own right).\n4. **^** The treaties of Maastricht and Rome form the EU's legal basis, and are also referred to as the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), respectively. They are amended by secondary treaties.\n5. **^** Between the EU's founding in 1993 and consolidation in 2009, the union consisted of three pillars, the first of which were the European Communities. The other two pillars consisted of additional areas of cooperation that had been added to the EU's remit.\n6. **^** The consolidation meant that the EU inherited the European Communities' legal personality and that the pillar system was abolished, resulting in the EU framework as such covering all policy areas. Executive/legislative power in each area was instead determined by a distribution of competencies between EU institutions and member states. This distribution, as well as treaty provisions for policy areas in which unanimity is required and qualified majority voting is possible, reflects the depth of EU integration as well as the EU's partly supranational and partly intergovernmental nature."

Lobbying\nat the EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the\naspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making\nprocess."

Countries accede to the\nunion by becoming a party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting\nthemselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership. This entails a\npartial delegation of sovereignty to the institutions in return for\nrepresentation within those institutions, a practice often referred to as\n\"pooling of sovereignty\". In some policies, there are several member states\nthat ally with strategic partners within the union. Examples of such alliances\ninclude the Baltic Assembly, the Benelux Union, the Bucharest Nine, the\nCraiova Group, the EU Med Group, the Lublin Triangle, the New Hanseatic\nLeague, the Three Seas Initiative, the Visegr\u00e1d Group, and the Weimar\nTriangle.\n\nTo become a member, a country must meet the Copenhagen criteria, defined at\nthe 1993 meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen. These require a stable\ndemocracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market\neconomy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU\nlaw. Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the\nresponsibility of the European Council.\n\nThe four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not\nEU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations:\nIceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market\nthrough the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties\nthrough bilateral treaties. The relationships of the European microstates\nAndorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and\nother areas of co-operation.\n\nList of member states in the European Union State | Accession\nto EU | Accession\nto EU\npredecessor | Population\n(2025)  | Area  | Population\ndensity\n---|---|---|---|---|---\nAustria | 1 January 1995 |  | 9,197,213 | 83,855 km2\n(32,377 sq mi)  | 110\nBelgium |  Founder (1993)  | 23 July 1952 | 11,900,123 | 30,528 km2\n(11,787 sq mi)  | 390\nBulgaria | 1 January 2007 |  | 6,437,360 | 110,994 km2\n(42,855 sq mi)  | 58\nCroatia | 1 July 2013 |  | 3,874,350 | 56,594 km2\n(21,851 sq mi)  | 68\nCyprus | 1 May 2004 |  | 979,865 | 9,251 km2\n(3,572 sq mi)  | 106\nCzech Republic | 1 May 2004 |  | 10,909,500 | 78,866 km2\n(30,450 sq mi)  | 138\nDenmark |  Founder (1993)  | 1 January 1973 | 5,992,734 | 43,075 km2\n(16,631 sq mi)  | 139\nEstonia | 1 May 2004 |  | 1,369,995 | 45,227 km2\n(17,462 sq mi)  | 30\nFinland | 1 January 1995 |  | 5,635,971 | 338,424 km2\n(130,666 sq mi)  | 17\nFrance |  Founder (1993)  | 23 July 1952 | 68,635,943 | 640,679 km2\n(247,368 sq mi)  | 107\nGermany |  Founder (1993)  | 23 July 1952 | 83,577,140 | 357,021 km2\n(137,847 sq mi)  | 234\nGreece |  Founder (1993)  | 1 January 1981 | 10,409,547 | 131,990 km2\n(50,960 sq mi)  | 79\nHungary | 1 May 2004 |  | 9,539,502 | 93,030 km2\n(35,920 sq mi)  | 103\nIreland |  Founder (1993)  | 1 January 1973 | 5,439,898 | 70,273 km2\n(27,133 sq mi)  | 77\nItaly |  Founder (1993)  | 23 July 1952 | 58,934,177 | 301,338 km2\n(116,347 sq mi)  | 196\nLatvia | 1 May 2004 |  | 1,856,932 | 64,589 km2\n(24,938 sq mi)  | 29\nLithuania | 1 May 2004 |  | 2,890,664 | 65,200 km2\n(25,200 sq mi)  | 44\nLuxembourg |  Founder (1993)  | 23 July 1952 | 681,973 | 2,586 km2\n(998 sq mi)  | 264\nMalta | 1 May 2004 |  | 574,250 | 316 km2\n(122 sq mi)  | 1,817\nNetherlands |  Founder (1993)  | 23 July 1952 | 18,044,027 | 41,543 km2\n(16,040 sq mi)  | 434\nPoland | 1 May 2004 |  | 36,497,495 | 312,685 km2\n(120,728 sq mi)  | 117\nPortugal |  Founder (1993)  | 1 January 1986 | 10,749,635 | 92,390 km2\n(35,670 sq mi)  | 116\nRomania | 1 January 2007 |  | 19,036,031 | 238,391 km2\n(92,043 sq mi)  | 80\nSlovakia | 1 May 2004 |  | 5,419,451 | 49,035 km2\n(18,933 sq mi)  | 111\nSlovenia | 1 May 2004 |  | 2,130,850 | 20,273 km2\n(7,827 sq mi)  | 105\nSpain |  Founder (1993)  | 1 January 1986 | 49,077,984 | 504,030 km2\n(194,610 sq mi)  | 97\nSweden | 1 January 1995 |  | 10,587,710 | 449,964 km2\n(173,732 sq mi)  | 24\nEuropean Union  | 450,380,320 | 4,233,262 km2\n(1,634,472 sq mi)  | 106"

It\nconvenes at least four times a year and comprises the president of the\nEuropean Council (presently Ant\u00f3nio Costa), the president of the European\nCommission and one representative per member state (either its head of state\nor head of government). The high representative of the union for foreign\naffairs and security policy (presently Kaja Kallas) also takes part in its\nmeetings. Described by some as the union's \"supreme political leadership\", it\nis actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's\npolicy agenda and strategies. Its leadership role involves solving disputes\nbetween member states and the institutions, and to resolving any political\ncrises or disagreements over controversial issues and policies. It acts as a\n\"collective head of state\" and ratifies important documents (for example,\ninternational agreements and treaties). Tasks for the president of the\nEuropean Council are ensuring the external representation of the EU, driving\nconsensus and resolving divergences among member states, both during meetings\nof the European Council and over the periods between them. The European\nCouncil should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international\norganisation independent of the EU and based in Strasbourg.\n\nThe European Commission acts both as the EU's executive arm, responsible for\nthe day-to-day running of the EU, and also the legislative initiator, with the\nsole power to propose laws for debate. The commission is 'guardian of the\nTreaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing. It\nhas 27 European commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each\nmember state, though commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the\nEU as a whole rather than their home state. The leader of the 27 is the\npresident of the European Commission (presently Ursula von der Leyen for\n2019\u20132024, reelected for the 2024\u20132029 term), proposed by the European\nCouncil, following and taking into account the result of the European\nelections, and is then elected by the European Parliament. The President\nretains, as the leader responsible for the entire cabinet, the final say in\naccepting or rejecting a candidate submitted for a given portfolio by a member\nstate, and oversees the commission's permanent civil service. After the\nPresident, the most prominent commissioner is the high representative of the\nunion for foreign affairs and security policy, who is _ex-officio_ a vice-\npresident of the European Commission and is also chosen by the European\nCouncil. The other 25 commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council\nof the European Union in agreement with the nominated president. The 27\ncommissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by a\nvote of the European Parliament.

The European System of\nCentral Banks (ESCB) consists of the ECB and the national central banks (NCBs)\nof all 27 member states of the European Union. The ESCB is not the monetary\nauthority of the eurozone, because not all EU member states have joined the\neuro.

(It does not have a\nformal constitution: its status is defined by the Treaty of European Union and\nthe Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). It is more integrated\nthan a traditional confederation of states because the general level of\ngovernment widely employs qualified majority voting in some decision-making\namong the member states, rather than relying exclusively on unanimity. It is\nless integrated than a federal state because it is not a state in its own\nright: sovereignty continues to flow 'from the bottom up', from the several\npeoples of the separate member states, rather than from a single\nundifferentiated whole. This is reflected in the fact that the member states\nremain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of\ncompetences to the union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-\ncalled _Kompetenz-kompetenz_); in that they retain control of the use of armed\nforce; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of\nunilateral withdrawal under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. In\naddition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that\nneed to be determined collectively are so determined.\n\nUnder the principle of supremacy, national courts are required to enforce the\ntreaties that their member states have ratified, even if doing so requires\nthem to ignore conflicting national law, and (within limits) even\nconstitutional provisions. The direct effect and supremacy doctrines were not\nexplicitly set out in the European Treaties but were developed by the Court of\nJustice itself over the 1960s, apparently under the influence of its then most\ninfluential judge, Frenchman Robert Lecourt. The question whether the\nsecondary law enacted by the EU has a comparable status in relation to\nnational legislation, has been a matter of debate among legal scholars."

In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was\nintroduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act.

The unanimity and difficult issues\ntreated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which\noccurred over the war in Iraq.\n\nThe coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the high\nrepresentative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy who speaks\non behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of\narticulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of\npolicy into a common alignment.

Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of\nlegislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental\nprotection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature\nconservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and\nbiotechnology. According to the Institute for European Environmental Policy,\nenvironmental law comprises over 500 Directives, Regulations and Decisions,\nmaking environmental policy a core area of European politics.\n\nEuropean policy-makers originally increased the EU's capacity to act on\nenvironmental issues by defining it as a trade problem. Trade barriers and\ncompetitive distortions in the Common Market could emerge due to the different\nenvironmental standards in each member state. In subsequent years, the\nenvironment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors,\nprinciples and procedures. The legal basis for EU environmental policy was\nestablished with the introduction of the Single European Act in 1987.\n\nInitially, EU environmental policy focused on Europe. More recently, the EU\nhas demonstrated leadership in global environmental governance, e.g. the role\nof the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto\nProtocol despite opposition from the United States. This international\ndimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which\nrecognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international\nagreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level\nand worldwide. The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership\nambitions. EU law has played a significant role in improving habitat and\nspecies protection in Europe, as well as contributing to improvements in air\nand water quality and waste management.\n\nMitigating climate change is one of the top priorities of EU environmental\npolicy. In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20 per cent of the\nenergy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have\nto be lower in 2020 by at least 20 per cent compared to 1990 levels. In 2017,\nthe EU emitted 9.1 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions. The European\nUnion claims that already in 2018, its GHG emissions were 23% lower than in\n1990.\n\nThe EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions\ninto the economy. The European Green Capital is an annual award given to\ncities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life\nin urban areas to create smart city. In the 2019 elections to the European\nParliament, the green parties increased their power, possibly because of the\nrise of post materialist values. Proposals to reach a zero carbon economy in\nthe European Union by 2050 were suggested in 2018\u20132019. Almost all member\nstates supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019. The Czech Republic,\nEstonia, Hungary, and Poland disagreed. In June 2021, the European Union\npassed a European Climate Law with targets of 55% GHG emissions reduction by\n2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050. Also in the same year, the European Union\nand the United States pledged to cut methane emissions by 30% by 2030. The\npledge is considered as a big achievement for climate change mitigation. A\nresearch report from November 2024 declared that the Czech Republic is the\nEU's most toxic country in Europe for care emissions."

Approximately three fifths of the energy available in\nthe EU came from imports (mostly of fossil fuels). Renewable energy\ncontributed 18.1 per cent of the EU's total energy supply in 2019, and 11.1\nper cent of the final energy consumption.\n\nThe EU has had legislative power in the area of energy policy for most of its\nexistence; this has its roots in the original European Coal and Steel\nCommunity. The introduction of a mandatory and comprehensive European energy\npolicy was approved at the meeting of the European Council in October 2005,\nand the first draft policy was published in January 2007.\n\nEnergy Community\n\nThe EU has five key points in its energy policy: increase competition in the\ninternal market, encourage investment and boost interconnections between\nelectricity grids; diversify energy resources with better systems to respond\nto a crisis; establish a new treaty framework for energy co-operation with\nRussia while improving relations with energy-rich states in Central Asia and\nNorth Africa; use existing energy supplies more efficiently while increasing\nrenewable energy commercialisation; and finally increase funding for new\nenergy technologies.\n\nIn 2007, EU countries as a whole imported 82 per cent of their oil, 57 per\ncent of their natural gas and 97.48 per cent of their uranium demands. The\nthree largest suppliers of natural gas to the European Union are Russia,\nNorway and Algeria, that amounted for about three quarters of the imports in\n2019. There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been\nattempting to reduce. However, in May 2022, it was reported that the European\nUnion is preparing another sanction against Russia over its invasion of\nUkraine. It is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks,\nas well as individuals and companies. According to an article by Reuters, two\ndiplomats stated that the European Union may impose a ban on imports of\nRussian oil by the end of 2022. In May 2022, the European Commission published\nthe 'RePowerEU' initiative, a \u20ac300 billion plan outlining the path towards the\nend of EU dependence on Russian fossil fuels by 2030 and the acceleration on\nthe clean energy transition."

TEN-T comprises\ntwo network layers: the Core Network, which is to be completed by 2030; and\nthe Comprehensive Network, which is to be completed by 2050. The network is\ncurrently made up of 9 core corridors: the Baltic\u2013Adriatic Corridor, the North\nSea\u2013Baltic Corridor, the Mediterranean Corridor, the Orient/East\u2013Med Corridor,\nthe Scandinavian\u2013Mediterranean Corridor, the Rhine\u2013Alpine Corridor, the\nAtlantic Corridor, the North Sea\u2013Mediterranean Corridor, and the Rhine\u2013Danube\nCorridor.

The Port of\nRotterdam is the busiest in the EU, and the world's largest seaport outside of\nEast Asia, located in and near the city of Rotterdam, in the province of South\nHolland in the Netherlands. The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA),\nfounded in 2002 in Lisbon, Portugal, is charged with reducing the risk of\nmaritime accidents, marine pollution from ships and the loss of human lives at\nsea by helping to enforce the pertinent EU legislation.\n\nAir transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Airport\nnetwork. European airports are categorized as international, community, or\nregional. The Charles de Gaulle Airport is the busiest in the EU, located in\nand near the city of Paris, in France. The European Common Aviation Area\n(ECAA) is a single market in aviation. ECAA agreements were signed on 5 May\n2006 in Salzburg, Austria between the EU and some third countries. The ECAA\nliberalises the air transport industry by allowing any company from any ECAA\nmember state to fly between any ECAA member states airports, thereby allowing\na \"foreign\" airline to provide domestic flights. The Single European Sky (SES)\nis an initiative that seeks to reform the European air traffic management\nsystem through a series of actions carried out in four different levels\n(institutional, operational, technological and control and supervision) with\nthe aim of satisfying the needs of the European airspace in terms of capacity,\nsafety, efficiency and environmental impact. Civil aviation safety is under\nthe responsibility of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It\ncarries out certification, regulation and standardisation and also performs\ninvestigation and monitoring. The idea of a European-level aviation safety\nauthority goes back to 1996, but the agency was only legally established in\n2002, and began operating in 2003.\n\nRail transportation is organised under the TEN-T by the Trans-European Rail\nnetwork, made up of the high-speed rail network and the conventional rail\nnetwork. The Gare du Nord railway station is the busiest in the EU, located in\nand near the city of Paris, in France. Rail transport in Europe is being\nsynchronised with the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) with the\ngoal of greatly enhancing safety, increase efficiency of train transports and\nenhance cross-border interoperability. This is done by replacing former\nnational signalling equipment and operational procedures with a single new\nEurope-wide standard for train control and command systems. This system is\nconducted by the European Union Agency for Railways (ERA).\n\nTransport documents used in the European Union\n\n* European driving licence\n(Croatian version pictured)\n\n* European vehicle registration plate\n(Slovak version pictured)\n\n* European vehicle registration certificate\n(Austrian version pictured)\n\n* European disabled parking permit\n(Polish version pictured)"

Accordingly, the union\nhas legislated in areas such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and\ncriminal justice.\n\nThe EU has also established agencies to co-ordinate police, prosecution and\ncivil litigations across the member states: Europol for police co-operation,\nCEPOL for training of police forces and the Eurojust for co-operation between\nprosecutors and courts. It also operates the EUCARIS database of vehicles and\ndrivers, the Eurodac, the European Criminal Records Information System, the\nEuropean Cybercrime Centre, FADO, PRADO and others.\n\nProhibitions against discrimination have a long standing in the treaties. In\nmore recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against\ndiscrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual\norientation. The treaties declare that the European Union itself is \"founded\non the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the\nrule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons\nbelonging to minorities ... in a society in which pluralism, non-\ndiscrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and\nmen prevail.\" By virtue of these powers, the EU has enacted legislation on\nsexism in the work-place, age discrimination, and racial discrimination.\n\nIn 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental\nRights of the European Union. The charter is a codified catalogue of\nfundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged. It\nconsolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of\nJustice and derived from the \"constitutional traditions common to the member\nstates\". The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has,\non occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to\nthose fundamental rights.\n\nSigning the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU\nmembership. Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it\nis neither a state nor had the competence to accede. The Lisbon Treaty and\nProtocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede\nto the convention while the latter formally permits it.\n\nThe EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose\nand ideas, especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy.\nFurthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social\nCharter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights\nare created by the Council of Europe. The EU has also promoted human rights\nissues in the wider world. The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed\nits worldwide abolition. Abolition of the death penalty is a condition for EU\nmembership. On 19 October 2020, the European Union revealed new plans to\ncreate a legal structure to act against human rights violations worldwide. The\nnew plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility\nto target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations\nand abuses around the world.\n\nExamples of identity, travel and health documents used in the EU\n\n* EU national identity card\n(German version pictured (2024))\n\n* Schengen visa\n(German version)\n\n* A passport, displaying the name of the member state, the national coat of arms and the words \"European Union\" given in their official language(s)\n(Irish version pictured)\n\n* European Health Insurance Card\n(Slovenian version pictured)"

There are some EU policies that have\naffected sport, such as the free movement of workers, which was at the core of\nthe Bosman ruling that prohibited national football leagues from imposing\nquotas on foreign players with EU member state citizenship.\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon requires any application of economic rules to take into\naccount the specific nature of sport and its structures based on voluntary\nactivity. This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the\nInternational Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the\napplication of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap\nbetween rich and poor clubs. The EU does fund a programme for Israeli,\nJordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4\nPeace project."

Tarquinia National Museum,\nItaly\n\nThe flag of Europe consists of a circle of 12 golden stars on a blue\nbackground. Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag\nwas adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present\nEuropean Union, in 1986. The Council of Europe gave the flag a symbolic\ndescription in the following terms, though the official symbolic description\nadopted by the EU omits the reference to the \"Western world\":\n\n> Against the blue sky of the Western world, the stars symbolise the peoples\n> of Europe in a form of a circle, the sign of union. The number of stars is\n> invariably twelve, the figure twelve being the symbol of perfection and\n> entirety.\n\n\u2014 Council of Europe. Paris, 7\u20139 December 1955.\n\n_United in Diversity_ was adopted as the motto of the union in 2000, having\nbeen selected from proposals submitted by school pupils. Since 1985, the flag\nday of the union has been Europe Day, on 9 May (the date of the 1950 Schuman\ndeclaration). The anthem of the EU is an instrumental version of the prelude\nto the _Ode to Joy_ , the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth\nsymphony. The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has\nsince been played on official occasions. Besides naming the continent, the\nGreek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a\npersonification of Europe. Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in\nthe guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the\npresent union. Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the EU's\ninstitutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of euro\nbanknotes. The bull is, for its part, depicted on all residence permit cards.\n\nCharles the Great, also known as Charlemagne (Latin: _Carolus Magnus_) and\nlater recognised as _Pater Europae_ (\"Father of Europe\"), has a symbolic\nrelevance to Europe. The commission has named one of its central buildings in\nBrussels after Charlemagne and the city of Aachen has since 1949 awarded the\nCharlemagne Prize to champions of European unification. Since 2008, the\norganisers of this prize, in conjunction with the European Parliament, have\nawarded the Charlemagne Youth Prize in recognition of similar efforts led by\nyoung people."

According to a 2019 study of the member states who joined from\n1973 to 2004, \"without European integration, per capita incomes would have\nbeen, on average, approximately 10% lower in the first ten years after joining\nthe EU\". Greece was the exception reported by the study, which analysed up to\n2008, \"to avoid confounding effects from the global financial crisis\". A 2021\nstudy in the _Journal of Political Economy_ found that the 2004 enlargement\nhad aggregate beneficial economic effects on all groups in both the old and\nnew member states. The largest winners were the new member states, in\nparticular unskilled labour in the new member states.\n\nThe European Union is frequently cited as having made a major contribution to\npeace in Europe, in particular by pacifying border disputes, and to the spread\nof democracy, especially by encouraging democratic reforms in aspiring Eastern\nEuropean member states after the collapse of the USSR. Scholar Thomas Risse\nwrote in 2009, \"there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that\nthe EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new\ndemocracies.\" However, R. Daniel Kelemen argues that the EU has proved\nbeneficial to leaders who are overseeing democratic backsliding, as the EU is\nreluctant to intervene in domestic politics, gives authoritarian governments\nfunds which they can use to strengthen their regimes, and because freedom of\nmovement within the EU allows dissenting citizens to leave their backsliding\ncountries. At the same time, the union might provide through Article 7 of the\nTreaty on European Union an external constraint that prevents electoral\nautocracies, currently Hungary, from progressing into closed autocracies."
