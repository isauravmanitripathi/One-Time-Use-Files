Since its\nfounding, the CBSS has contributed to ensuring positive developments within\nthe Baltic Sea region and has served as a driving force for multilateral\ncooperation.\n\nSince 1998 the CBSS has been served by a permanent international Secretariat\nthat is located in Stockholm, Sweden and funded by the Member States. The\nhighest institution of CBSS is the conference of foreign ministers, which\nconvenes once per year.\n\nOn 3 March 2022, a declaration from 11 members of the CBSS suspended Russia\nfrom the Council's activities with immediate effect as a result of 2022\nRussian invasion of Ukraine. Additionally, Belarus, with observer status, was\nsuspended from participating in CBSS activities."
