        "generated_section_content_md": "Specialised agency of the United Nations\n\nThe **International Civil Aviation Organization** (**ICAO** /\u02cca\u026a\u02c8ke\u026ao\u028a/ _eye-\nKAY-oh_) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that coordinates the\nprinciples and techniques of international air navigation, and fosters the\nplanning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and\norderly growth. The ICAO headquarters are located in the Quartier\ninternational de Montr\u00e9al of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\n\nThe ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air\nnavigation, its infrastructure, flight inspection, prevention of unlawful\ninterference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international\ncivil aviation. ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation that\nare followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the\nConvention on International Civil Aviation.\n\nThe Air Navigation Commission (ANC) is the technical body within ICAO. The\ncommission is composed of 19 commissioners, nominated by the ICAO's\ncontracting states and appointed by the ICAO Council. Commissioners serve as\nindependent experts, who although nominated by their states, do not serve as\nstate or political representatives. International Standards and Recommended\nPractices are developed under the direction of the ANC through the formal\nprocess of ICAO Panels. Once approved by the commission, standards are sent to\nthe council, the political body of ICAO, for consultation and coordination\nwith the member states before final adoption.\n\nICAO is distinct from other international air transport organizations,\nparticularly because it alone is vested with international authority (among\nsignatory states): other organizations include the International Air Transport\nAssociation (IATA), a trade association representing airlines; the Civil Air\nNavigation Services Organisation (CANSO), an organization for air navigation\nservice providers (ANSPs); and the Airports Council International, a trade\nassociation of airport authorities. In addition there are several regional\ncivil aviation commissions, such as the Latin America Civil Aviation\nCommission (LACAC) who focus on challenges and growth in specific regions."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the early 20th Century, the International Telecommunication Union met to\ndiscuss and implement one of the first internationally agreed upon standards\nrelating to aviation, country-specific prefixes for aircraft callsigns. The\nfirst convention was held in 1903 in Berlin, Germany, but no agreements were\nreached among the eight countries that attended. At the second convention in\n1906, also held in Berlin, twenty-seven countries attended. The third\nconvention, held in London in 1912, allocated the first radio callsigns for\nuse by aircraft. Following this, at the Paris Convention of 1919, a forerunner\nto ICAO named ICAN was established, the **International Commission for Air\nNavigation**. ICAN continued to operate until 1945.\n\nThe Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago\nConvention, in Chicago, was signed by 52 countries on 7 December 1944. Under\nits terms, a **Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization** was to\nbe established, to be replaced in turn by a permanent organization when\ntwenty-six countries ratified the convention. PICAO began operating on 6 June\n1945, replacing ICAN. The 26th country ratified the convention on 5 March 1947\nand, consequently, PICAO was disestablished on 4 April 1947 and replaced by\nICAO, which began operations the same day.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn October 1947, ICAO became an agency of the United Nations under its\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC)."

Qatar promised to construct a massive new headquarters for ICAO\nand to cover all moving expenses, stating that Montreal \"was too far from\nEurope and Asia\", \"had cold winters\", was hard to attend due to the Canadian\ngovernment's slow issuance of visas, and that the taxes imposed on ICAO by\nCanada were too high. According to _The Globe and Mail_ , Qatar's invitation\nwas at least partly motivated by the pro-Israel foreign policy of Canadian\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper. Approximately a month later, Qatar withdrew its\nbid after a separate proposal to the ICAO's governing council to move the ICAO\ntriennial conference to Doha was defeated by a vote of 22\u201314.\n\nIn June 2014, the Montreal Metro station closest to the ICAO headquarters was\nrenamed Square-Victoria\u2013OACI, celebrating the 70th anniversary of ICAO's\npresence in Montreal."

Many of the tweets were related to the COVID-19\npandemic and Taiwan's exclusion from ICAO safety and health bulletins due to\npressure from China. In response, ICAO issued a tweet stating that publishers\nof \"irrelevant, compromising and offensive material\" would be \"precluded\".\n\nSince that action, the organization has followed a policy of blocking anyone\nasking about it.\n\nThe United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs harshly criticized ICAO's\nperceived failure to uphold principles of fairness, inclusion, and\ntransparency by silencing non-disruptive opposing voices. Senator Marco Rubio\nalso criticized the move. The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and\nlegislators criticized the move, with MOFA head Jaushieh Joseph Wu tweeting in\nsupport of those blocked.\n\nIn January 2020, Anthony Philbin, Chief of Communications for the ICAO\nSecretary General, defended ICAO's actions, stating, 'We felt completely\njustified in taking steps to protect the integrity of the information and\ndiscussions that our followers reasonably expect from our feeds.' In exchanges\nwith the International Flight Network, Philbin refused to acknowledge the\nexistence of Taiwan.\n\nOn 1 February 2020, the United States Department of State issued a press\nrelease heavily criticizing ICAO's actions, characterizing them as\n\"outrageous, unacceptable, and not befitting of a UN organization.\""

Please help update this article to reflect recent events or\nnewly available information. _( February 2009)_\n---|---\n\nEmissions from international aviation are specifically excluded from the\ntargets agreed under the Kyoto Protocol. Instead, the Protocol invites\ndeveloped countries to pursue the limitation or reduction of emissions through\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization. ICAO's environmental committee\ncontinues to consider the potential for using market-based measures such as\ntrading and charging, but this work is unlikely to lead to global action. It\nis currently developing guidance for states who wish to include aviation in an\nemissions trading scheme (ETS) to meet their Kyoto commitments, and for\nairlines who wish to participate voluntarily in a trading scheme.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nEmissions from domestic aviation are included within the Kyoto targets agreed\nby countries. This has led to some national policies such as fuel and emission\ntaxes for domestic air travel in the Netherlands and Norway, respectively.\nAlthough some countries tax the fuel used by domestic aviation, there is no\nduty on kerosene used on international flights.\n\nICAO is currently opposed to the inclusion of aviation in the European Union\nEmission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The EU, however, is pressing ahead with its\nplans to include aviation.[_citation needed_]\n\nICAO has been called \"flawed and biased in favour of the industry\" by Jo\nDardenne, the manager for aviation at Transport & Environment."

        "generated_section_content_md": "On 6 October 2016, the ICAO finalized an agreement among its 191 member\nnations to address the more than 1000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted\nannually by international passenger and cargo flights. The agreement will use\nan offsetting scheme called CORSIA (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme\nfor International Aviation) under which forestry and other carbon-reducing\nactivities are directly funded, amounting to about 2% of annual revenues for\nthe sector. Rules against 'double counting' should ensure that existing forest\nprotection efforts are not recycled. The scheme did not take effect until 2021\nand will be voluntary until 2027, but many countries, including the US and\nChina, have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date. Under the agreement,\nthe global aviation emissions target is a 50% reduction by 2050 relative to\n2005. NGO reaction to the deal was mixed.\n\nThe agreement has critics. It is not aligned with the 2015 Paris climate\nagreement, which set the objective of restricting global warming to 1.5 to 2\n\u00b0C. A late draft of the agreement would have required the air transport\nindustry to assess its share of global carbon budgeting to meet that\nobjective, but the text was removed in the agreed version. CORSIA will\nregulate only about 25 percent of aviation's international emissions, since it\ngrandfathers all emissions below the 2020 level, allowing unregulated growth\nuntil then. Only 65 nations will participate in the initial voluntary period,\nnot including significant emitters Russia, India and perhaps Brazil. The\nagreement does not cover domestic emissions, which are 40% of the global\nindustry's overall emissions. One observer of the ICAO convention made this\nsummary:\n\n> Airline claims that flying will now be green are a myth. Taking a plane is\n> the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won't reduce\n> demand for jet fuel one drop. Instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in\n> other industries,\n\nalthough another critic called it \"a timid step in the right direction.\"\n\nICAO has expressed strong opposition to 2025 proposals from various UN bodies\nand international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund,\nsuggesting new taxes or levies on international aviation to fund global\nclimate initiatives. ICAO contends that such measures could undermine CORSIA,\nemphasizing that CORSIA is the sole global framework for addressing\ninternational aviation emissions and warning that additional levies could\ndisrupt its implementation and the broader goal of sustainable aviation\ndevelopment. While acknowledging the need for increased climate finance, ICAO\nurged stakeholders to support existing mechanisms like CORSIA rather than\nintroducing potentially conflicting financial measures."

The first ICAO emissions regulation was\nadopted in 1981, and more stringent NOx standards were subsequently adopted:\nCAEP/2 in 1993, CAEP/4 in 1999, CAEP/6 in 2005 and CAEP/8 in 2011.

        "generated_section_content_md": "Most air accident investigations are carried out by an agency of a country\nthat is associated in some way with the accident. For example, the Air\nAccidents Investigation Branch conducts accident investigations on behalf of\nthe British Government. ICAO has conducted four investigations involving air\ndisasters, of which two were passenger airliners shot down while in\ninternational flight over hostile territory.\n\n1. Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 which was shot down on 21 February 1973 by Israeli F-4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula during a period of tension that led to the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War killing 108 people.\n2. Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which was shot down on 1 September 1983 by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor near Moneron Island just west of Sakhalin Island during a period of heightened Cold War tension killing all 269 people on board including U.S. Representative Larry McDonald.\n3. UTA Flight 772, which was destroyed by a bomb on 19 September 1989 above the Sahara Desert in Niger, en route from N'Djamena, Chad, to Paris, France. The explosion caused the aircraft to break up, killing all 156 passengers and 15 crew members, including the wife of U.S. Ambassador Robert L. Pugh. Investigators determined that a bomb placed in the cargo hold by Chadian rebels backed by Libya was responsible for the explosion. A French court convicted _in absentia_ six Libyans of planning and implementing the attack.\n4. The 1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue aircraft on 24 February 1996, when two civilian aircraft operating north of Cuba were shot down by two jets of the Cuban Air Force. The Cuban military alleged that aircraft operated by the group Brothers to the Rescue had scattered propaganda leaflets onto Cuba prior to the incident, and issued orders that such aircraft be shot down. All four crew members aboard the two aircraft were killed, whilst a third aircraft managed to escape and return to the American mainland."
