Each country's\nsituation will be examined during a three-and-a-half-hour debate.\n\nThe first cycle of the UPR took place between 2008 and 2011, the second cycle\nbetween 2012 and 2016, and the third cycle began in 2017 and is expected to be\ncompleted in 2021.\n\nThe General Assembly resolution establishing the Council provided that \"the\nCouncil shall review its work and functioning five years after its\nestablishment\". The main work of the review was undertaken in an\nIntergovernmental Working Group established by the Council in its Resolution\n12/1 of 1 October 2009. The review was finalized in March 2011, by the\nadoption of an \"Outcome\" at the Council's 16th session, annexed to Resolution\n16/21.\n\nFirst cycle: The following terms and procedures were set out in General\nAssembly Resolution 60/251:\n\n* Reviews are to occur over a four-year period (48 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2008 and 2011;\n* The order of review should follow the principles of universality and equal treatment;\n* All Member States of the Council will be reviewed while they sit at the Council and the initial members of the Council will be first;\n* The selection of the countries to be reviewed must respect the principle of equitable geographical allocation;\n* The first Member States and the first observatory States to be examined will be selected randomly in each regional group to guarantee full compliance with the equitable geographical allocation. Reviews shall then be conducted alphabetically.\n\nSecond cycle: HRC Resolution 16/21 brought the following changes:\n\n* Reviews are to occur over a four-and-a-half-year period (42 countries per year). Accordingly, the 193 countries that are members of the United Nations shall normally all have such a Review between 2012 and 2016;\n* The order of review will be similar to the 1st cycle;\n* The length of each Review will be extended from three to three-and-a-half hours;\n* The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the implementation of the recommendations.\n\nSimilar mechanisms exist in other organizations: International Atomic Energy\nAgency, Council of Europe, International Monetary Fund, Organization of\nAmerican States, and the World Trade Organization."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The UNHRC complaint procedure was established on 18 June 2007 (by UNHRC\nResolution 5/1) for reporting of consistent patterns of gross and reliably\nattested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in any part of\nthe world and under any circumstances.\n\nThe UNHRC set up two working groups for its Complaint Procedure:\n\n* the _Working Group on Communications_ (WGC) \u2013 consists of five experts designated by the Advisory Committee from among its members, one from each regional group. The experts serve for three years with the possibility of one renewal. The experts determine whether a complaint deserves investigation, in which case it is passed to the WGS.\n* the _Working Group on Situations_ (WGS) \u2013 has five members, appointed by the regional groups from among its members on the Council for one year, which is renewable once. The WGS meets twice a year for five working days to examine the communications transferred to it by the WGC, including the replies of states thereon, as well as the situations which are already before the UNHRC under the complaint procedure. The WGS, on the basis of the information and recommendations provided by the WGC, presents the UNHRC with a report on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms and makes recommendations to the UNHRC on the course of actions to take.\n\nFiling a complaint\n\nThe Chairman of the WGC screens complaints for admissibility. A complaint must\nbe in writing, and cannot be anonymous. Examples provided by the UNHRC of\ncases that would be considered consistent patterns of gross human rights\nviolations include alleged deterioration of human rights of people belonging\nto a minority, including forced evictions, racial segregation and substandard\nliving conditions, and alleged degrading situation of prison conditions for\nboth detainees and prison workers, resulting in violence and death of inmates.\nIndividuals, groups, or NGOs can claim to be victims of human rights\nviolations or that have direct, reliable knowledge of such violations.\n\nComplaints can be regarding any state, regardless of whether it has ratified a\nparticular treaty. Complaints are confidential and the UNHRC will only\ncommunicate with the complainant, unless it decides that the complaint will be\naddressed publicly.\n\nThe interaction with the complainant and the UNHRC during the complaints\nprocedure will be on an as-needed basis. UNHRC Resolution 5/1, paragraph 86,\nemphasizes that the procedure is victims-oriented. Paragraph 106 provides that\nthe complaint procedure shall ensure that complainants are informed of the\nproceedings at the key stages. The WGC may request further information from\ncomplainants or a third party.\n\nFollowing the initial screening a request for information will be sent to the\nstate concerned, which shall reply within three months of the request being\nmade. WGS will then report to the UNHRC, which will usually be in the form of\na draft resolution or decision on the situation referred to in the complaint.\n\nThe UNHRC will decide on the measures to take in a confidential manner as\nneeded, but this will occur at least once a year. As a general rule, the\nperiod of time between the transmission of the complaint to the state\nconcerned and consideration by the UNHRC shall not exceed 24 months. Those\nindividuals or groups who make a complaint should not publicly state the fact\nthat they have submitted a complaint.\n\nTo be accepted complaints must:\n\n* be in writing and submitted in one of the six UN official languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish);\n* contain a description of the relevant facts (including names of alleged victims, dates, location, and other evidence), with as much detail as possible, and shall not exceed 15 pages;\n* not be manifestly politically motivated;\n* not be exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass media;\n* not be already dealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body, or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights;\n* be after domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless it appears that such remedies would be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged;\n* not use a language that is abusive or insulting.\n\n\nThe complaint procedure is not designed to provide remedies in individual\ncases or to provide compensation to alleged victims.\n\nEffectiveness\n\nDue to the confidential manner of the procedure, it is almost impossible to\nfind out what complaints have passed through the procedure and also how\neffective the procedure is.\n\nThere is a principle of non-duplication, which means that the complaint\nprocedure cannot take up the consideration of a case that is already being\ndealt with by a special procedure, a treaty body or other United Nations or\nsimilar regional complaints procedure in the field of human rights.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nOn the UNHRC website under the complaints procedure section there is a list of\nsituations referred to the UNHRC under the complaint procedure since 2006.\nThis was only available to the public as of 2014, however generally does not\ngive any details regarding the situations that were under consideration other\nthan the state that was involved.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn some cases the information is slightly more revealing, for example a\nsituation that was listed was the situation of trade unions and human rights\ndefenders in Iraq that was considered in 2012, but the UNHRC decided to\ndiscontinue that consideration.\n\nThe complaints procedure has been said to be too lenient due to its\nconfidential manner. Some have often questioned the value of the procedure,\nbut 94% of states respond to the complaints raised with them.\n\nThe OHCHR receives between 11,000 and 15,000 communications per year. During\n2010\u201311, 1,451 out of 18,000 complaints were submitted for further action by\nthe WGC. The UNHRC considered four complaints in their 19th session in 2012.\nThe majority of the situations that have been considered have since been\ndiscontinued.[_citation needed_]\n\nHistory shows that the procedure works almost in a petition like way; if\nenough complaints are received then the UNHRC is very likely to assign a\nspecial rapporteur to the state or to the issue at hand. It has been said that\nan advantage of the procedure is the confidential manner, which offers the\nability to engage with the state concerned through a more [diplomatic]\nprocess, which can produce better results than a more adversarial process of\npublic accusation.\n\nThe procedure is considered by some a useful tool to have at the disposal on\nthe international community for situations where naming and shaming has proved\nineffective. Also another advantage is that a complaint can be made against\nany state, regardless of whether it has ratified a particular\ntreaty.[_citation needed_]\n\nDue to the limited information that is provided on the complaints procedure it\nis hard to make comments on the process itself, the resources it uses versus\nits effectiveness."

The additional\nduty is phrased thus:\n\n(d) To report on instances in which the abuse of the right of freedom of expression constitutes an act of racial or religious discrimination, taking into account articles 19 (3) and 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and general comment No. 15 of the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which stipulates that the prohibition of the dissemination of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the freedom of opinion and expression\n\n(quoted from p. 67 in the official draft record of the council). The amendment\nwas proposed by Egypt and Pakistan and passed by 27 votes to 15 against, with\nthree abstentions with the support of other members of the Organisation of the\nIslamic Conference, China, Russia, and Cuba. As a result of the amendment over\n20 of the original 53 co-sponsors of the main resolution \u2013 to renew the\nmandate of the Special Rapporteur \u2013 withdrew their support, though the\nresolution was carried by 32 votes to 0, with 15 abstentions. _Inter alia_ the\ndelegates from India and Canada protested that the Special Rapporteur now has\nas his/her duty to report not only infringements of the rights to freedom of\nexpression, but in some cases also employment of the rights, which \"turns the\nspecial rapporteur's mandate on its head\".\n\nOutside the UN, the amendment was criticised by organizations including\nReporters Without Borders, Index on Censorship, Human Rights Watch, and the\nInternational Humanist and Ethical Union, all of whom share the view that the\namendment threatens freedom of expression.\n\nIn terms of the finally cast votes, this was far from the most controversial\nof the 36 resolutions adapted by the 7th session of the Council. The highest\ndissents concerned combating defamation of religions, with 21 votes for, 10\nagainst, and 14 abstentions (resolution 19, pp. 91\u201397), and the continued\nsevere condemnation of and appointment of a Special Rapporteur for North\nKorea, with votes 22\u20137 and 18 abstentions (resolution 15, pp. 78\u201380). There\nwere also varying degrees of dissent for most of the various reports\ncriticising Israel; while on the other hand a large number of resolutions were\ntaken unanimously without voting, including the rather severe criticism of\nMyanmar (resolutions 31 and 32), and the somewhat less severe on Sudan\n(resolution 16)."

HRW also\ncalled on the Council to avoid the selectivity that discredited its\npredecessor and urged it to hold special sessions on other urgent situations,\nsuch as that in Darfur.\n\nIn 2006, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan argued that the UNHRC should not have\na \"disproportionate focus on violations by Israel. Not that Israel should be\ngiven a free pass. Absolutely not. But the Council should give the same\nattention to grave violations committed by other states as well\".\n\nOn 20 June 2007, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon issued a statement that read:\n\"The Secretary-General is disappointed at the Council's decision to single out\nonly one specific regional item given the range and scope of allegations of\nhuman rights violations throughout the world.\" Ban Ki-moon also reiterated the\nimportance of investigating and upholding international humanitarian law with\nrespect to the Israeli occupied Palestinian territories, stating in 2016 that\n\"History proves that people will always resist occupation...Palestinian\nfrustration and grievances are growing under the weight of nearly a half-\ncentury of occupation. Ignoring this won't make it disappear. No one can deny\nthat the everyday reality of occupation provokes anger and despair, which are\nmajor drivers of violence and extremism and undermine any hope of a negotiated\ntwo-state solution.\"\n\nFormer president of the Council Doru Costea, the European Union, Canada, the\nUnited States and Britain have at various times accused the UNHRC of focusing\ndisproportionately on the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict and Israel's occupation\nof the West Bank.\n\nSpeaking at the IDC's Herzliya Conference in Israel in January 2008, Dutch\nForeign Minister Maxime Verhagen criticized the actions of the Human Rights\nCouncil actions against Israel. \"At the United Nations, censuring Israel has\nbecome something of a habit, while Hamas's terror is referred to in coded\nlanguage or not at all. The Netherlands believes the record should be set\nstraight, both in New York and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva\",\nVerhagen said.\n\nIn 2008 UNHRC released a statement calling on Israel to stop its military\noperations in the Gaza Strip and to open the Strip's borders to allow the\nentry of food, fuel and medicine. UNHRC adopted the resolution by a vote of 30\nto 1, with 15 states abstaining.\n\n\"Unfortunately, neither this resolution nor the current session addressed the\nrole of both parties. It was regretful that the current draft resolution did\nnot condemn the rocket attacks on Israeli civilians,\" said Canada's\nrepresentative Terry Cormier, the lone voter against.\n\nThe United States and Israel boycotted the session. U.S. ambassador Warren\nTichenor said the Council's unbalanced approach had \"squandered its\ncredibility\" by failing to address continued rocket attacks against Israel.\n\"Today's actions do nothing to help the Palestinian people, in whose name the\nsupporters of this session claim to act,\" he said in a statement. \"Supporters\nof a Palestinian state must avoid the kind of inflammatory rhetoric and\nactions that this session represents, which only stoke tensions and erode the\nchances for peace\", he added. \"We believe that this council should deplore the\nfact that innocent civilians on both sides are suffering\", Slovenian\nAmbassador Andrej Logar said on behalf of the seven EU states on the council.\n\nAt a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon\nresponded when asked about its special session on Gaza, that \"I appreciate\nthat the council is looking in-depth into this particular situation. And it is\nrightly doing so. I would also appreciate it if the council will be looking\nwith the same level of attention and urgency at all other matters around the\nworld. There are still many areas where human rights are abused and not\nproperly protected\", he said.\n\nDugard was succeeded in 2008 by Jewish Professor of international law Richard\nFalk, who has compared Israel's treatment of Palestinians with the Nazis'\ntreatment of Jews during the Holocaust. After a conflict with the Palestinian\nAuthority's Mahmoud Abbas over his decision, under US pressure, to delay a\nUNHCR vote on Richard Goldstone's report on violations of international\nhumanitarian law during the 2008-2009 Israel-Gaza war, widely criticized among\nPalestinians including calls on Abbas to stand down and the PA to be\ndissolved, Abbas informally asked Falk to resign, accusing him of being among\nother things \"a partisan of Hamas\". Falk disputed this and called the reasons\ngiven \"essentially untrue\", with the actual motivation behind his call on\nAbbas to cease his delaying of the UNHRC vote. The Israeli government\nannounced it would deny Falk a visa to Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza\nStrip, at least until the September 2008 meeting of the UNHCR.\n\nIn July 2011, Richard Falk posted a cartoon that critics have described as\nanti-Semitic onto his blog. The cartoon depicted a bloodthirsty dog with the\nword \"USA\" on it wearing a kippah, or Jewish head covering. In response, Falk\nwas heavily criticized by world leaders in the United States, certain European\ncountries and Israel.\n\nAt UNHRC's opening session in February 2011, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary\nClinton criticized the council's \"structural bias\" against the State of\nIsrael: \"The structural bias against Israel \u2013 including a standing agenda item\nfor Israel, whereas all other countries are treated under a common item \u2013 is\nwrong. And it undermines the important work we are trying to do together.\"\n\nIn March 2012, the UNHRC was criticized for facilitating an event in the UN\nGeneva building featuring a Hamas politician. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu castigated the UNHRC's decision stating, \"He represents an\norganization that indiscriminately targets children and grown-ups, and women\nand men. Innocents \u2013 is their special favorite target\". Israel's ambassador to\nthe UN Ron Prosor denounced the speech stating that Hamas was an\ninternationally recognized terrorist organization that targeted civilians.\n\"Inviting a Hamas terrorist to lecture to the world about human rights is like\nasking Charles Manson to run the murder investigation unit at the NYPD\", he\nsaid.\n\nThe United States urged UNHRC in Geneva to stop its anti-Israel bias. It took\nparticular exception to the council's Agenda Item 7, under which at every\nsession, Israel's human rights record is debated. No other country has a\ndedicated agenda item. The US Ambassador to UNHRC Eileen Chamberlain Donahoe\nsaid that the United States was deeply troubled by the \"Council's biased and\ndisproportionate focus on Israel.\" She said that the hypocrisy was further\nexposed in the Golan Heights resolution that was advocated by the Syrian\nregime at a time when it was murdering its own citizens.\n\nOn 19 June 2018, the United States pulled out of the UNHRC accusing the body\nof bias against Israel and a failure to hold human rights abusers accountable.\nNikki Haley, US Ambassador to the UN, called the organisation a \"cesspool of\npolitical bias\". At UNHRC's 38th Session on 2 July 2018, Western nations _de\nfacto_ boycotted Agenda Item 7 by not speaking to it. Israel had been\ncondemned in 78 resolutions by the Council since its creation in 2006\u2014more\nresolutions condemning Israel than the rest of the world combined."

UN Watch condemned the move to nominate Sudan, pointing out\nthat Sudan's President Omar Al-Bashir was indicted for genocide by the\nInternational Criminal Court. According to UN Watch, Sudan was virtually\nassured of securing a seat. A joint letter of 18 African and international\ncivil society organizations urged foreign ministers of the African Union to\nreverse its endorsement of Ethiopia and Sudan for a seat, accusing them of\nserious human rights violations and listing examples of such violations, and\nstating that they should not be rewarded with a seat. Sudan was not on the\nballot for the 12 November 2012 election to UNHRC, but Ethiopia was elected."

The original draft resolution from the United States noted the\nUNHRC \"concern that the LLRC [Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission]\nreport [did] not adequately address serious allegations of violations of\ninternational law\". The UNHRC resolution then:\n\n\n\n\"1. Calls on the Government of Sri Lanka to implement the constructive recommendations in the LLRC report and take all necessary additional steps to fulfill its relevant legal obligations and commitment to initiate credible and independent actions to ensure justice, equity, accountability and reconciliation for all Sri Lankans,\n2\\. Requests that the Government of Sri Lanka present a comprehensive action plan as expeditiously as possible detailing the steps the Government has taken and will take to implement the LLRC recommendations and also to address alleged violations of international law,\n3\\. Encourages the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant special procedures to provide, and the Government of Sri Lanka to accept, advice and technical assistance on implementing those steps and requests the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to present a report to the Council on the provision of such assistance at its twenty-second session.\"\n\nSri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva Tamara Kunanayakam pointed out that 80% of the\nUNHRC's funding requirements are supplied by powerful nations such as the\nUnited States and its allies. Also, key positions in the UNHRC are mostly held\nby those who have served in the foreign services of such countries. Sri\nLanka's position is that this fact is significantly detrimental to the\nimpartiality of the UNHRC activities, especially when dealing with the\ndeveloping world. As a result, Sri Lanka, along with Cuba and Pakistan,\nsponsored a resolution seeking transparency in funding and staffing the UNHRC,\nduring its 19th session starting in February 2012. The resolution was adopted\non 4 April 2012.\n\nThe original US UNHRC draft resolution that prompted the Sri Lankan, Cuban,\nand Pakistani transparency initiative was thereafter significantly modified,\nand passed in 2013. Narayan Lakshman, writing from Washington, D.C. for _The\nHindu_ , said the United States \"watered down\" the resolution, while UN Watch\ndescribed the revised resolution as \"toned down\". Lakshman noted that \"an\nentire paragraph calling for 'unfettered access'... by a host of external\nobservers and specialists was deleted\", and the reworded resolution's demand\nfor international investigation into \"alleged human rights violations\" was\nelevated but then \"veer[ed] off towards an apparent preference for Sri Lanka\nto conduct its own internal investigation\". He noted that in general \"weaker\nlanguage has been inserted in place of more condemnatory tone\". The revised\nresolution remained entitled \"Promoting Reconciliation and Accountability in\nSri Lanka\" and was assigned UN code \"A/HRC/22/L.1/Rev.1\". As finally\nsubmitted, the U.S. resolution was co-sponsored by 33 countries, including\nthree other members of the U.N. Security council at that time (the UK, France,\nand Germany), and four other European nations (Ireland, Italy, the\nNetherlands, and Switzerland). By a vote of 25 in favor\u2014which included the\nresolution sponsors and other EU countries, as well as South Korea\u2014and 13\nagainst, the resolution was adopted on 21 March 2013 (with nine countries\nabstaining or absent)."

Bush declared that the United States would\nnot seek a seat on the Council, saying it would be more effective from the\noutside. He did pledge, however, to support the Council financially. State\nDepartment spokesman Sean McCormack said, \"We will work closely with partners\nin the international community to encourage the council to address serious\ncases of human rights abuse in countries such as Iran, Cuba, Zimbabwe, Burma,\nSudan, and North Korea\".\n\nThe U.S. State Department said on 5 March 2007 that, for the second year in a\nrow, the United States had decided not to seek a seat on the Human Rights\nCouncil, asserting the body had lost its credibility with repeated attacks on\nIsrael and a failure to confront other rights abusers. Spokesman Sean\nMcCormack said the council had had a \"singular focus\" on Israel, while\ncountries such as Cuba, Myanmar and North Korea had been spared scrutiny. He\nsaid that though the United States will have only an observer role, it will\ncontinue to shine a spotlight on human rights issues. The most senior\nRepublican member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the U.S. House of\nRepresentatives, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, supported the administration decision.\n\"Rather than standing as a strong defender of fundamental human rights, the\nHuman Rights Council has faltered as a weak voice subject to gross political\nmanipulation,\" she said.\n\nUpon passage of UNHRC's June 2007 institution-building package, the U.S.\nrestated its condemnation of bias in the institution's agenda. Spokesman Sean\nMcCormack again criticised the Commission for focusing on Israel in light of\nmany more pressing human rights issues around the world, such as Sudan or\nMyanmar, and went on to criticise the termination of special rapporteurs to\nCuba and Belarus, as well as procedural irregularities that prevented member-\nstates from voting on the issues; a similar critique was issued by the\nCanadian representative. In September 2007, the US Senate voted to cut off\nfunding to the council.\n\nThe United States joined with Australia, Canada, Israel, and three other\ncountries in opposing the UNHRC's draft resolution on working rules citing\ncontinuing misplaced focus on Israel at the expense of action against\ncountries with poor human-rights records. The resolution passed 154\u20137 in a\nrare vote forced by Israel including the support of France, the United\nKingdom, and China, although it is usually approved through consensus. United\nStates Ambassador to the United Nations, Zalmay Khalilzad, spoke about the\n\"council's relentless focus during the year on a single country \u2013 Israel,\"\ncontrasting that with failure \"to address serious human rights violations\ntaking place in other countries such as Zimbabwe, DPRK (North Korea), Iran,\nBelarus and Cuba.\" Khalilzad said that aside from condemnation of the\ncrackdown of the Burmese anti-government protests, the council's past year was\n\"very bad\" and it \"had failed to fulfill our hopes\".\n\nOn 6 June 2008, _Human Rights Tribune_ announced that the United States had\nwithdrawn entirely from the UNHRC, and had withdrawn its observer status.\n\nThe United States boycotted the Council during the George W. Bush\nadministration, but reversed its position on it during the Obama\nadministration. Beginning in 2009 however, with the United States taking a\nleading role in the organization, American commentators began to argue that\nthe UNHRC was becoming increasingly relevant.\n\nOn 31 March 2009, the administration of Barack Obama announced that it would\nreverse the country's previous position and would join the UNHRC; New Zealand\nindicated its willingness not to seek election to the council to make room for\nthe United States to run unopposed, along with Belgium and Norway for the WEOG\nseats.\n\nOn 19 June 2018, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Ambassador to\nthe United Nations Nikki Haley announced that the United States, under\nPresident Donald Trump, was pulling out of the United Nations Human Rights\nCouncil, accusing the council being \"hypocritical and self-serving\"; in the\npast, Haley had accused it of \"chronic anti-Israel bias\". \"When the Human\nRights Council treats Israel worse than North Korea, Iran, and Syria, it is\nthe Council itself that is foolish and unworthy of its name. It is time for\nthe countries who know better to demand changes,\" Haley said in a statement at\nthe time, pointing to the council's adoption of five resolutions condemning\nIsrael. \"The United States continues to evaluate our membership in the Human\nRights Council. Our patience is not unlimited.\"\n\nIn December 2020, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said that\nthe UN Human Rights Council was \"a haven for despots and dictators, hostile to\nIsrael, and ineffectual on true human rights crises\".\n\nOn 8 February 2021, following the election of Joe Biden, Secretary of State\nAntony Blinken announced that the Biden administration would\nreengage[_clarification needed_] with the UN Human Rights Council.\n\nOn 4 February 2025, President Trump reinstituted his policy and again withdrew\nfrom the UN Human Rights Council as part of a larger motion for \"ending U.S.\nsupport for radical anti-American UN organizations.\" A White House Fact sheet\nsays the UN Human Rights Council \"has demonstrated consistent bias against\nIsrael,\" and that it \u201chas not fulfilled its purpose and continues to be used\nas a protective body for countries committing horrific human rights\nviolations.\" However, this withdraw is confusing, since the last US term of\nmembership already ended on 1 January, spokesperson Pascal Sim responded that\nUS can't \"withdraw\" from an organization when they no longer be a member and\nautomatically be an observer."
