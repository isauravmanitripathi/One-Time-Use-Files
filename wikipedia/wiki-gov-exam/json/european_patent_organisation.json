The European Patent Organisation has its seat at\nMunich, Germany, and has administrative and financial autonomy. The\norganisation is independent from the European Union, and has as member states\nall 27 EU member states along with 12 other European states.\n\nThe evolution of the Organisation is inherently linked to that of the European\nPatent Convention. See European Patent Convention (EPC) for the history of the\nEuropean patent system as set up by the EPC, operated by the European Patent\nOffice (EPO), and supervised by the Administrative Council of the European\nPatent Organisation."

The European Patent\nOrganisation is in that sense an international organisation \"modelled on a\nmodern state order and based on the separation of powers principle\"."

The most recent member state to join the EPC was Montenegro\nwhich did so on 1 October 2022.\n\nIn addition, there is one \"extension state\", Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is\nnot a Contracting State to the EPC but has signed an extension agreement under\nwhich the protection conferred by European patent applications and patents is\nextended to the relevant country. Slovenia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia,\nCroatia, North Macedonia, Albania, Serbia, and Montenegro were all extension\nstates prior to joining the EPC.\n\nFurthermore, there are so-called \"validation states\", which are not\nContracting States to the EPC but have signed validation agreements that act\nsimilarly to the extension agreements to extend the protection of European\npatent applications and European patents. Morocco, Moldova, Tunisia, Cambodia,\nand Georgia became validation states on 1 March 2015, 1 November 2015, 1\nDecember 2017, 1 March 2018, and 15 January 2024, respectively."
