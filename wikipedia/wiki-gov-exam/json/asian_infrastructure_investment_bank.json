        "generated_section_content_md": "Multilateral development bank\n\nThe **Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank** (**AIIB**) is a multilateral\ndevelopment bank and international financial institution that aims to\ncollectively improve economic and social outcomes in Asia. It is the world's\nsecond largest multi-lateral development institution. Headquartered in\nBeijing, China, the bank currently has 110 members, including 12 prospective\nmembers from around the world. The breakdown of the 110 members by continents\nare as follows: 42 in Asia, 26 in Europe, 22 in Africa, 10 in Oceania, 8 in\nSouth America, and 2 in North America. The bank started operation after the\nagreement entered into force on 25 December 2015, after ratifications were\nreceived from 10 member states holding a total number of 50% of the initial\nsubscriptions of the Authorized Capital Stock.\n\nThe United Nations has addressed the launch of AIIB as having potential for\n\"scaling up financing for sustainable development\" and to improve the global\neconomic governance. The starting capital of the bank was US$100 billion,\nequivalent to 2\u20443 of the capital of the Asian Development Bank and about half\nthat of the World Bank. The bank was first proposed by China in 2013 and the\ninitiative was launched at a ceremony in Beijing in October 2014. It has since\nreceived the highest credit ratings from the three biggest rating agencies in\nthe world, and has been seen since its inception as a potential rival or an\nalternative to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."

Infrastructure Investment Bank\" was\nfirst made by the Vice Chairman of the China Center for International Economic\nExchanges, a Chinese government think tank, at the Bo'ao Forum in April 2009.\nThe initial context was to make better use of Chinese foreign currency\nreserves during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe initiative was officially launched by General Secretary of the Chinese\nCommunist Party Xi Jinping on a state visit to Indonesia in October 2013. The\nChinese government has been frustrated with what it regards as the slow pace\nof reforms and governance, and wants greater input in global established\ninstitutions like the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank which it\nclaims are heavily dominated by American, European and Japanese interests.\n\nAt inception, the AIIB was explicitly linked to China's Belt and Road\nInitiative. The AIIB was subsequently broadened to include investments with\nstates that are not involved with the BRI and its mission characterized more\ngenerally as building \"infrastructure for tomorrow,\" with a focus on green\ninfrastructure and connectivity.\n\nIn April 2014, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang delivered a keynote speech at the\nopening of the Boao Forum for Asia and said that China was ready to intensify\nconsultations with relevant parties in and outside Asia on the preparations\nfor the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank Institute published a report in 2010 which said\nthat the region requires $8 trillion to be invested from 2010 to 2020 in\ninfrastructure for the region to continue economic development. In a 2014\neditorial, _The Guardian_ newspaper wrote that the new bank could allow\nChinese capital to finance these projects and allow it a greater role to play\nin the economic development of the region commensurate with its growing\neconomic and political clout. But until March 2015, China in the ADB has only\n5.47 percent voting right, while Japan and US have a combined 26 percent\nvoting right (13 percent each) with a share in subscribed capital of 15.7\npercent and 15.6 percent, respectively. Dominance by both countries and slow\nreforms underlie China's wish to establish the AIIB, while both countries\nworry about China's increasing influence.\n\nIn June 2014 China proposed doubling the registered capital of the bank from\n$50 billion to $100 billion and invited India to participate in the founding\nof the bank. Thank was founded in Beijing in October 2014. On 24 October 2014,\ntwenty-one countries signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the\nAIIB in Beijing, China: Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, India, Kazakhstan,\nKuwait, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Mongolia, Nepal, Oman, Pakistan, Philippines,\nQatar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. Indonesia's\njoining was slightly delayed due to their new presidential administration not\nbeing able to review the membership in time. Indonesia signed the MOU on 25\nNovember 2014.\n\nThe U.S. allegedly tried to keep Australia and South Korea from becoming\nprospective founding members, after they expressed an interest in it. However,\nboth Australia and South Korea applied to join the bank in March 2015.\n\nHong Kong's Financial Secretary John Tsang announced in his budget speech in\nFebruary 2015 that the territory would join the AIIB. It did however not\nbecome one of the prospective founding members and negotiated as part of the\nChinese delegation.\n\nIn early March 2015, the United Kingdom's Chancellor of the Exchequer, George\nOsborne, announced that the UK had decided to apply to join the Bank, becoming\nthe third Western country to do so after Luxembourg and New Zealand. The\nannouncement was criticised by the U.S. Obama Administration. A US government\nofficial told _Financial Times_ , \"We are wary about a trend toward constant\naccommodation of China, which is not the best way to engage a rising power.\"\nThe official further stated that the British decision was taken after \"no\nconsultation with the US.\" In response, the UK indicated that the subject had\nbeen discussed between Chancellor Osborne and US Treasury Secretary Jack Lew\nfor several months preceding the decision. It was further stated that joining\nthe bank as a founding member would allow the UK to influence the development\nof the institution. By encouraging Chinese investments in the next generations\nof nuclear power plants, Osborne announced that \"the City of London would\nbecome the base for the first clearing house for the yuan outside Asia.\"\n\nFollowing the criticism, the White House National Security Council, in a\nstatement to _The Guardian_ , declared,\n\n> Our position on the AIIB remains clear and consistent. The United States and\n> many major global economies all agree there is a pressing need to enhance\n> infrastructure investment around the world. We believe any new multilateral\n> institution should incorporate the high standards of the World Bank and the\n> regional development banks. Based on many discussions, we have concerns\n> about whether the AIIB will meet these high standards, particularly related\n> to governance, and environmental and social safeguards [...] The\n> international community has a stake in seeing the AIIB complement the\n> existing architecture, and to work effectively alongside the World Bank and\n> Asian Development Bank.\n\nAfter the UK's decision to join the AIIB, a surge of new applications\nfollowed, including several other European states \u2013 including Germany, France\nand Italy \u2013 with a total number reaching 53 by the end of March. German\nFinance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble stated, \"We want to contribute our long-\nstanding experience with international financial institutions to the creation\nof the new bank by setting high standards and helping the bank to get a high\ninternational reputation.\" In March 2015, the South Korean Ministry of\nStrategy and Finance announced that it, too, is planning to join the AIIB,\nciting its potential in helping South Korean companies win deals in\ninfrastructural projects as well expanding South Korea's influence in\ninternational banking as a founding member. States could indicate their\ninterest in becoming a Prospective Founding Member until 31 March 2015.\n\nNegotiations took place in the framework of five Chief Negotiators Meetings\n(CNMs) which took place between November 2014 and May 2015. The Articles of\nAgreement, the legal framework of the bank, were concluded in the fifth CNM.\nIt was signed on 29 June 2015 by 50 of the named 57 prospective founding\nmembers in Beijing, while the other seven signed later.\n\nOn 25 December 2015, the Articles of Agreement entered into force. On 16\nJanuary 2016, the board of governors of the bank convened its inaugural\nmeeting in Beijing and declared the bank open for business. Jin Liqun was\nelected as the bank's president for a five-year term. 17 states (Australia,\nAustria, Brunei, China, Georgia, Germany, Jordan, Luxembourg, Mongolia,\nMyanmar, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, Singapore, South\nKorea and the United Kingdom) together holding 50.1% of the initial\nsubscriptions of Authorized Capital Stock, had deposited the instrument of\nratification for the agreement, triggering entry into force, and making them\nall founding members and bringing the Articles of Agreement, the bank's\ncharter, into force. 35 other states followed later, taking the amount of\nAuthorized Capital Stock held by the 29 members of the bank to 74%."

However, mainland China claims that there is the possibility for Taiwan to obtain membership at a later date. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that Taiwan should avoid creating a \"two Chinas\" or \"one China, one Taiwan\" situation. ROC Finance Minister Chang Sheng-ford announced in April 2016 that Taiwan was not being treated with \"dignity\" or \"respect\" during the registration process and Taiwan eventually chose to leave the decision to join to the new president.\n\nUnited States \u2013 **No commitment**\n\n* The United States' officials have expressed concerns about whether the AIIB would have high standards of governance, and whether it would have environmental and social safeguards. The United States is reported to have used diplomatic pressure to try and prevent key allies, such as Australia, from joining the bank, and expressed disappointment when others, such as Britain, joined. The US' opposition to the AIIB, as well as its attempt to dissuade allies from joining was seen as a manifestation of a multifaceted containment strategy.\n\nJapan \u2013 **\"Under Consideration\" / No commitment**\n\n* Masato Kitera, Tokyo's envoy in Beijing, stated previously that Japan might join the AIIB. Japanese Finance Minister Tar\u014d As\u014d previously indicated interest in joining the AIIB, but later switched his stance. Yoshihide Suga, Japan's Cabinet Secretary, told the public that Japan was still seeking China's full explanation of the AIIB as he stated, \"As of today, Japan will not join AIIB and a clear explanation has not been received from China\" and \"Japan is dubious about whether (the AIIB) would be properly governed or whether it would damage other creditors\". He also stated that Japan is no longer considering whether or not to join the bank. The Japanese Government Spokesman also announced that Japan would not join the AIIB. Japanese prime minister Shinz\u014d Abe also added that Japan does not need to join the bank. But two years later, in May 2017, Shinz\u014d Abe said joining the AIIB, created in part to fund the initiative, could be an option if governance questions were resolved. Toshihiro Nikai, secretary-general of the ruling party Liberal Democratic Party, suggested joining the AIIB."
