UNIFEM helped fund projects\nthat aided women and their families. UNIFEM developed a strategy of aiding\nwomen to become their \"own agents for change rather than recipients of\ncharity.\" UNIFEM also helped to ensure that UN programmes followed guidelines\ndeveloped by the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination\nagainst Women (CEDAW). UNIFEM was also involved in recognizing women's rights\nas human rights. It advocated gender equality around the world. UNIFEM also\nsaw women's rights as an issue of peace and security.\n\nUNIFEM operated on a budget of voluntary contributions to the organization.\nThe organization was based in New York City. Different countries and regions\nhad their own committees within UNIFEM. UNIFEM was one of the smaller agencies\nat the UN and was situated lower in the UN hierarchy, according to Canadian\npolitician Stephen Lewis."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the 1990s, UNIFEM became involved in broadening its scope. The organization\nbegan a campaign to define \"women's rights as human rights\" and how violence\nagainst women was also an economic development issue. UNIFEM hired researchers\nsuch as Roxanna Carrillo to demonstrate how violence against women was linked\nto a lack of women's access to economic opportunity. The campaign for \"women's\nrights as human rights\" was especially effective. UNIFEM began working on\nprojects to reduce gender-based violence and also to raise awareness of the\nproblem.\n\nAlso in the 1990s, African Women in Crisis (AFWIC) was created by UNIFEM to\nfocus on issues facing people in Africa. AFWIC helped women who were displaced\ndue to violence or emergencies in their own countries. AFWIC expanded on work\nbegun by Laketch Dirasse in East Africa.\n\nThe work of UNIFEM helped shape the issues addressed at the Fourth World\nConference on Women in 1995. Women at the conference decided that it was\nimportant that they \"claim formal power to directly shape public policy\".\n\nUNIFEM created a trust fund to help support twenty-three projects to combat\ngender-based violence and war crimes against women. The fund began funding\nprojects in 1997."
