Created in 1962, ESO has provided\nastronomers with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the\nsouthern sky. The organisation employs over 750 staff members and receives\nannual member state contributions of approximately \u20ac162 million. Its\nobservatories are located in northern Chile.\n\nESO has built and operated some of the largest and most technologically\nadvanced telescopes. These include the 3.6 m New Technology Telescope, an\nearly pioneer in the use of active optics, and the Very Large Telescope (VLT),\nwhich consists of four individual 8.2 m telescopes and four smaller auxiliary\ntelescopes which can all work together or separately. The Atacama Large\nMillimeter Array observes the universe in the millimetre and submillimetre\nwavelength ranges, and is the world's largest ground-based astronomy project\nto date. It was completed in March 2013 in an international collaboration by\nEurope (represented by ESO), North America, East Asia and Chile.\n\nCurrently under construction is the Extremely Large Telescope. It will use a\n39.3-metre-diameter segmented mirror, and become the world's largest optical\nreflecting telescope when operational towards the end of this decade. Its\nlight-gathering power will allow detailed studies of planets around other\nstars, the first objects in the universe, supermassive black holes, and the\nnature and distribution of the dark matter and dark energy which dominate the\nuniverse.\n\nESO's observing facilities have made astronomical discoveries and produced\nseveral astronomical catalogues. Its findings include the discovery of the\nmost distant gamma-ray burst and evidence for a black hole at the centre of\nthe Milky Way. In 2004, the VLT allowed astronomers to obtain the first\npicture of an extrasolar planet (2M1207b) orbiting a brown dwarf 173 light-\nyears away. The High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS)\ninstrument installed on the older ESO 3.6 m telescope led to the discovery of\nextrasolar planets, including Gliese 581c\u2014one of the smallest planets seen\noutside the Solar System."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The idea that European astronomers should establish a common large observatory\nwas broached by Walter Baade and Jan Oort at the Leiden Observatory in the\nNetherlands in spring 1953. It was pursued by Oort, who gathered a group of\nastronomers in Leiden to consider it on 21 June that year. Immediately\nthereafter, the subject was further discussed at the Groningen conference in\nthe Netherlands. On 26 January 1954, an ESO declaration was signed by\nastronomers from six European countries expressing the wish that a joint\nEuropean observatory be established in the southern hemisphere.\n\nAt the time, all reflector telescopes with an aperture of 2 metres or more\nwere located in the northern hemisphere. The decision to build the observatory\nin the southern hemisphere resulted from the necessity of observing the\nsouthern sky; some research subjects (such as the central parts of the Milky\nWay and the Magellanic Clouds) were accessible only from the southern\nhemisphere.\n\nDirector General | In office\n---|---\nOtto Heckmann | 1962\u20131969\nAdriaan Blaauw | 1970\u20131974\nLodewijk Woltjer | 1975\u20131987\nHarry van der Laan  | 1988\u20131992\nRiccardo Giacconi | 1993\u20131999\nCatherine Cesarsky | 1999\u20132007\nTim de Zeeuw | 2007\u20132017\nXavier Barcons | 2017\u2013present\nSource: _www.eso.org, about ESO_\n\nIt was initially planned to set up telescopes in South Africa where several\nEuropean observatories were located (Boyden Observatory), but tests from 1955\nto 1962 demonstrated that a site in the Andes was preferable: When J\u00fcrgen\nStock enthusiastically reported his observations from Chile, Otto Heckmann\ndecided to leave the South African project on hold. ESO\u2014at that time about to\nsign the contracts with South Africa\u2014decided to establish their observatory in\nChile. The ESO Convention was signed 5 October 1962 by Belgium, Germany,\nFrance, the Netherlands and Sweden. Otto Heckmann was nominated as the\norganisation's first director general on 1 November 1962. On 15 November 1963\nChile was chosen as the site for ESO's observatory.\n\nDirectors general of ESO (from left to right): Lodewijk Woltjer, Harry van der\nLaan, Catherine Cesarsky, Tim de Zeeuw and Xavier Barcons\n\nA preliminary proposal for a convention of astronomy organisations in these\nfive countries was drafted in 1954. Although some amendments were made in the\ninitial document, the convention proceeded slowly until 1960 when it was\ndiscussed during that year's committee meeting. The new draft was examined in\ndetail, and a council member of CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear\nResearch) highlighted the need for a convention between governments (in\naddition to organisations). The convention and government involvement became\npressing due to rapidly rising costs of site-testing expeditions. The final\n1962 version was largely adopted from the CERN convention, due to similarities\nbetween the organisations and the dual membership of some members.\n\nIn 1966, the first ESO telescope at the La Silla site in Chile began\noperating. Because CERN (like ESO) had sophisticated instrumentation, the\nastronomy organisation frequently turned to the nuclear-research body for\nadvice and a collaborative agreement between ESO and CERN was signed in 1970.\nSeveral months later, ESO's telescope division moved into a CERN building in\nGeneva and ESO's Sky Atlas Laboratory was established on CERN property. ESO's\nEuropean departments moved into the new ESO headquarters in Garching (near\nMunich), Germany, in 1980.\n\nIn 2015, Guillem Anglada-Escud\u00e9 confirmed the existence of Proxima Centauri b\nat the Southern Observatory."

It is used to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements primarily used in the search for large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting Gliese 86.

The telescope has an off-axis mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien design.

The telescope, in an altazimuth mount, began operation in October 2002. The primary purpose of the telescope is to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission satellite.\n* The Belgian TRAPPIST is a joint venture between the University of Li\u00e8ge and Geneva Observatory. The 0.60-metre telescope is specialised in comets, exoplanets, and was one of the few telescopes that observed a stellar occultation of the dwarf planet Eris, revealing that it may be smaller than Pluto.\n* The _Quick-action telescope for transient objects_ , TAROT, is a very fast-moving optical robotic telescope able to observe a gamma-ray burst from its beginning. Satellites detecting GRBs send signals to TAROT, which can provide a sub-arc second position to the astronomical community. Data from the TAROT telescope is also useful in studying the evolution of GRBs, the physics of a fireball and its surrounding material. It is operated from the Haute-Provence Observatory in France."
