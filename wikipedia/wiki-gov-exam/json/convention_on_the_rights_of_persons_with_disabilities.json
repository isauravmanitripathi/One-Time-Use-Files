        "generated_section_content_md": "Treaty of the United Nations\n\nThe **Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities** is an\ninternational human rights treaty of the United Nations intended to protect\nthe rights and dignity of persons with disabilities. Parties to the convention\nare required to promote, protect, and ensure the full enjoyment of human\nrights by persons with disabilities and ensure that persons with disabilities\nenjoy full equality under the law. The Convention serves as a major catalyst\nin the global disability rights movement enabling a shift from viewing persons\nwith disabilities as objects of charity, medical treatment and social\nprotection towards viewing them as full and equal members of society, with\nhuman rights. The convention was the first U.N. human rights treaty of the\ntwenty-first century.\n\nThe text was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 December\n2006, and opened for signature on 30 March 2007. Following ratification by the\n20th party, it came into force on 3 May 2008. As of April 2025, it has 164\nsignatories and 193 parties, 192 states and the European Union (which ratified\nit on 23 December 2010). The convention is monitored by the Committee on the\nRights of Persons with Disabilities for which annual Conferences of States\nParties to the CRPD have set guidelines since 2008. The thirteenth Conference\nof States Parties was scheduled to meet in New York in June 2020, then\nrescheduled tentatively to meet in December 2020 due to the COVID-19 crisis."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, like the other\nUnited Nations human rights conventions, (such as the International Covenant\non Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women) resulted from decades of activity\nduring which group rights standards developed from aspirations to binding\ntreaties.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly adopted the 1971 Declaration on the Rights\nof Mentally Retarded Persons followed by the Declaration on the Rights of\nDisabled Persons on 9 December 1975. 1981 was the International Year of\nDisabled Persons; an outcome of year was the World Programme of Action\nConcerning Disabled Persons. The Year was followed by the Decade of Disabled\nPersons, 1983\u20131992. In 1987, a global meeting of experts to review progress\nrecommended that the UN General Assembly should draft an international\nconvention on the elimination of discrimination against persons with\ndisabilities. Draft convention outlines were proposed by Italy and\nsubsequently Sweden, but no consensus was reached. Many government\nrepresentatives argued that existing human rights documents were sufficient.\nAn International Day of Persons with Disabilities (3 December) was proclaimed\nin 1992 General Assembly resolution 47/3. The United Nations General Assembly\nadopted the non-compulsory Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities\nfor Persons with Disabilities on 20 December 1993 (resolution 48/96 annex).\nMany analysts characterized the pre-CRPD documents as \"soft\", in contrast with\nthe \"hard\" treaty obligations of the CRPD.\n\nIn March, 2000, leaders of six international disability NGOs, along with about\n20 regional and national disability organizations, adopted the \"Beijing\nDeclaration on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the New Millennium\",\ncalling on all governments to support a Convention. In 2001, the General\nAssembly, following a proposal by Mexico, established an Ad Hoc Committee on a\nComprehensive and Integral International Convention on the Protection and\nPromotion of the Rights and Dignity of Persons with Disabilities to consider\nproposals for a comprehensive and integral convention to promote and protect\nthe rights and dignity of persons with disabilities, based on a holistic\napproach. Disability rights organisations, including Disabled Peoples'\nInternational, the World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry,\nLandmine Survivors Network (now Survivor Corps), and the International\nDisability Alliance influenced the drafting process. The International\nDisability Alliance served as coordinator of an ad hoc International\nDisability Caucus, participated actively in the drafting process, in\nparticular seeking a role for disabled persons and their organisations in the\nimplementation and monitoring of what became the Convention.\n\nIn 2001, at the 56th session of the United Nations General Assembly, Mexico\ninitiated negotiations, with active support from GRULAC (the Latin American\nregional group). When support for a Convention was foundering in 2002 due to\nWEOG opposition, New Zealand played a pivotal role in achieving cross-regional\nmomentum. Acting as facilitator from 2002\u201303, New Zealand eventually assumed\nthe formal role of Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee and led negotiations to a\nconsensus agreement in August 2006, working closely with other Committee\nmembers Jordan, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, and South Africa, as well as\nKorea and Mexico. Several observers commented on the \"esteem-seeking behavior\"\nof governments, national human rights institutions, and nongovernmental\norganizations.\n\nThe Convention became one of the most quickly supported human rights\ninstruments in history, with strong support from all regional groups. 160\nStates signed the Convention upon its opening in 2007 and 126 States ratified\nthe Convention within its first five years. In recognition of its role in\ncreating the convention, as well as the quality of New Zealand's landmark\nNational Disability Strategy, Governor-General of New Zealand Anand Satyanand\nreceived the 2008 World Disability Award on behalf of the nation.\n\nIn 2015, for the first time in its short history, the Committee on the Rights\nof Persons with Disabilities opened an investigation into a signatory state\nfor breaching their convention obligations. The investigation was triggered by\narticle 6 of the optional protocol, which provides that an investigation will\nbe carried out once the committee receives \"reliable information indicating\ngrave and systematic violation\" of the human rights of persons with\ndisabilities. The government of the United Kingdom was investigated, with the\nfinal report released in 2016.\n\nThe United States has been conspicuously absent from the States Parties that\nhave ratified or acceded to the convention. During Barack Obama's\nadministration the U.S. became a signatory to the convention on 24 July 2009.\nOn July 31, 2012, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee recommended U.S.\nratification, \"subject to three reservations, eight understandings and two\ndeclarations\". In December 2012, a vote in the United States Senate fell six\nvotes short of the two-thirds majority required for advice and consent on\nratification. In July 2014, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee again\napproved a resolution for advice and consent, but the measure was not brought\nto a vote of the full Senate."

The preamble is followed by 50 articles. Unlike many UN\ncovenants and conventions, it is not formally divided into parts.\n\n**Article 1** defines the purpose of the convention:\n\n> to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human\n> rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to\n> promote respect for their inherent dignity\n\n**Article 2** provides definitions of some keywords in CRPD provisions:\ncommunication, (including Braille, sign language, plain language and nonverbal\ncommunication), discrimination on the basis of disability, reasonable\naccommodation and universal design.\n\n**Article 3** delineates the CRPD's eight \"general principles\" described\nbelow, while **Article 4** delineates parties' \"general obligations.\"\n\n**Articles 5\u201332** define the rights of persons with disabilities and the\nobligations of states parties towards them. Many of these mirror rights\naffirmed in other UN conventions such as the International Covenant on Civil\nand Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural\nRights and the Convention Against Torture, but with specific obligations\nensuring that they can be fully realized by persons with disabilities.\n\nRights specific to this convention include the rights to accessibility\nincluding the information technology, the rights to live independently and be\nincluded in the community (Article 19), to personal mobility (article 20),\nhabilitation and rehabilitation (Article 26), and to participation in\npolitical and public life, and cultural life, recreation and sport (Articles\n29 and 30).\n\nIn addition, parties to the Convention must raise awareness of the human\nrights of persons with disabilities (Article 8), and ensure access to roads,\nbuildings, and information (Article 9).\n\n**Articles 33\u201339** govern reporting and monitoring of the convention by\nnational human rights institutions (Article 33) and the Committee on the\nRights of Persons with Disabilities (Articles 34 through 39).\n\n**Articles 40\u201350** govern ratification, entry into force, relation to\n\"regional integration organizations\", reservations, amendment, and\ndenunciation of the convention. **Article 49** requires that the Convention be\navailable in accessible formats, and **Article 50** provides that the\nconvention's \"Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish texts\" are\n\"equally authentic\"."

Various authors group them in different categories; this entry will\ndescribe basics and mechanics, then describe three categories roughly\nequivalent to the disputed concept of three generations of human rights.\n\nWith increasing frequency, observers have commented on the overlapping and\ninterdependence of categories of rights. In 1993, the World Conference on\nHuman Rights' Vienna Declaration provided in its Article 5 that since human\nrights were \"universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated ...\nStates have a duty to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental\nfreedoms.\"[_full citation needed_] Gerard Quinn specifically commented on the\nfact that the CRPD \"co-mingles civil and political rights with economic,\nsocial and cultural rights\". This is especially apparent in the CRPD where\npolitical rights have been meaningless without social and economic support for\nthe economic and social rights are meaningless without participation."

Development has recently\nbeen an oft-expressed United Nations concern, especially since 4 December\n1986, when the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Declaration on the\nRight to Development.\n\nDevelopment and disability rights both depend on popular participation,\ninternational cooperation, and national implementation. As expressed in the\nCRPD's Article 33, parties are to involve civil society, and have designated\n\"focal points\", often in practice national human rights institutions."

It also interprets Article 25(f), which bars\nthe discriminatory denial of health care, as permitting a person to refuse\nmedical treatment, including food or fluids.\n\nPoland interprets Articles 23 and 25 as not conferring any right to abortion.\n\nThe United Kingdom has reservations relating to the right to education,\nimmigration, service in the armed forces and an aspect of social security law.\n\nAmong the other parties attaching reservations, understandings, or\ndeclarations to their ratification or accession were the European Union,\nAzerbaijan, Canada, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, the Syrian Arab Republic, Venezuela,\nand many others.

The text is based\nheavily on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All\nForms of Discrimination against Women.\n\nThe Optional Protocol entered into force with the convention on 3 May 2008. As\nof October 2023, it has 94 signatories and 105 parties.\n\nA first stage is a Committee holding on the complaint's admissibility. The\nCRPD requires \"exhaustion of domestic remedies\" (Article 2 of the Optional\nProtocol). The Committee may also rule a communication inadmissible if it is\nanonymous or not sufficiently substantiated. An applicant may offer\nsubstantiation that resort to domestic remedies would be unreasonably\nprolonged or impossible.\n\nThe United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights maintains\na record of all individual complaints filed under the Optional Protocol.\nSeveral of the communications that were ruled admissible resulted in comments\nby advocates and nongovernmental analysts.\n\nA disabled peoples organization, the International Disability Alliance,\nsummarizes and interprets each case (37 cases as of 30 July 2020). Individuals\nfrom Australia, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, Mexico, Lithuania, Germany,\nSpain, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Hungary, Greece, and Ecuador\nbrought the first complaints. One communication considered by the committee\nwas _X v. Tanzania._ It involves an individual with albinism who had an arm\ncut off. The failure of the state, demonstrated to the committee, was a\nfailure to investigate or prosecute.\n\nSome other CRPD communications concerned community living for a previously\ninstitutionalized Australian, a Lithuanian's access to justice after a traffic\naccident, a deaf Australian's access to justice, an Austrian's access to\nnecessary information to use public transportation, and employment in Italy,\nBrazil, and elsewhere."

Particularly within\nthe United States, prominent Republican senators and interest groups such as\nthe Home School Legal Defense Association claim that the CRPD erodes\nsovereignty. Such claims are contested by leading advocates and scholars.\n\nConversely, several critical disability studies scholars have argued that the\nCRPD is unlikely to promote the kinds of changes necessary to advance\ndisability rights claims in order to address inequality. Studies also indicate\nthat not all members of the disability movement feel that the CRPD has been a\nuseful tool for advocacy: advocates and grassroots activists in the UK and in\nHungary claimed they did not see the CRPD and other human rights laws\nimpactful in everyday advocacy and they do not prefer to use such laws,\nbecause they rarely work in practice. The 2016 elections to the Committee on\nthe Rights of Persons with Disabilities resulted in only one female member and\n17 males being elected, an imbalance rectified in the 2018 elections. This was\ndespite the CRPD's explicit call in Article 34 for consideration of \"balanced\ngender representation\" on the committee."
