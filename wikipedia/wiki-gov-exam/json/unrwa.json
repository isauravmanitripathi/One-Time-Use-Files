UNRWA's\nmandate encompasses Palestinians who fled or were expelled during the Nakba,\nthe 1948 Palestine war, and subsequent conflicts, as well as their\ndescendants, including legally adopted children. As of 2019, more than 5.6\nmillion Palestinians are registered with UNRWA as refugees.\n\nUNRWA was established in 1949 by the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to provide\nrelief to all refugees resulting from the 1948 conflict; this initially\nincluded Jewish and Arab Palestine refugees inside the State of Israel until\nthe Israeli government took over this responsibility in 1952. As a subsidiary\nbody of the UNGA, UNRWA's mandate is subject to periodic renewal every three\nyears; it has consistently been extended since its founding, most recently\nuntil 30 June 2026.\n\nUNRWA employs over 30,000 people, most of them Palestinian refugees, and a\nsmall number of international staff. Originally intended to provide employment\nand direct relief, its mandate has broadened to include providing education,\nhealth care, and social services to its target population. UNRWA operates in\nfive areas: Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank,\nincluding East Jerusalem; aid for Palestinian refugees outside these five\nareas is provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n(UNHCR), established in 1950 as the main agency to aid all other refugees\nworldwide. UNRWA is the only UN agency dedicated to helping refugees from a\nspecific region or conflict.\n\nUNRWA has received praise and recognition for its work by various governments,\npublic figures, and independent monitors. It has also been subject to\ncontroversy related to its operations, role in the Gaza Strip, relationship\nwith Hamas, and textbook content. Most recently, the agency faced allegations\nby the Israeli government that twelve of its employees were involved in the\nOctober 7 attacks, leading to lay-offs, an investigation, and the temporary\nsuspension of funding by numerous donors. As of May 2024, several major donors\nhave since resumed funding as the investigation remains ongoing.[_needs\nupdate_] In October 2024, Israel's parliament passed a bill designating UNRWA\nas a terrorist group and prohibiting it from operating within the country.\nIsrael has long opposed the Palestinian right of return and has accused UNRWA\nof \"perpetuating the refugee issue\". In January 2025, Israel's UNRWA ban went\ninto effect."

In response\nto the political aspects of the conflict, less than a month later the General\nAssembly adopted Resolution 194, creating the United Nations Conciliation\nCommission for Palestine (UNCCP), mandated to help achieve a final settlement\nbetween the warring parties, including facilitating \"the repatriation,\nresettlement and economic and social rehabilitation of the refugees\" in\ncollaboration with the UNRPR. By that time, the conflict had displaced over\n700,000 people.\n\nUnable to resolve the \"Palestine problem\" which required political solutions\nbeyond the scope of its mandate, the UNCCP recommended the creation of a\n\"United Nations agency designed to continue relief activities and initiate\njob-creation projects\" while an ultimate resolution was pending. Pursuant to\nthis recommendation and to paragraph 11 of Resolution 194 which concerned\nrefugees, on 8 December 1949 the General Assembly adopted Resolution 302(IV)\nwhich established the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine\nRefugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The resolution was adopted and passed\nunopposed, supported by Israel and the Arab states with only the Soviet bloc\nand South Africa abstaining.\n\nUNRWA succeeded the UNRPR with a broader mandate for humanitarian assistance\nand development and the requirement to function neutrally. When it began\noperations in 1950 the initial scope of its work was \"direct relief and works\nprogrammes\" to Palestine refugees in order to \"prevent conditions of\nstarvation and distress\u2026 and to further conditions of peace and stability\".\nUNRWA's mandate was expanded in December 1950 through Resolution 393(V) which\ninstructed the agency to \"establish a reintegration fund which shall be\nutilized ... for the permanent re-establishment of refugees and their removal\nfrom relief\". A 26 January 1952 resolution allocated four times as much\nfunding on reintegration than on relief, requesting UNRWA to otherwise\ncontinue providing programs for health care, education, and general welfare."

Since 1991, the UN General\nAssembly has adopted an annual resolution allowing the 1967 refugees within\nthe UNRWA mandate. UNRWA's \"mandate\" is not a single document but the sum of\nall relevant resolutions and requests of the General Assembly. While focused\non Palestine refugees, it also extends to persons displaced by \"the 1967 and\nsubsequent hostilities\" and occasionally to a broader cross-section of the\nlocal community. Several categories of persons have long been registered as\neligible to receive UNRWA services although not \"Palestine refugees\". The\ndescendants of Palestine refugee males, including adopted children, are also\neligible for registration as refugees."

It also receives some\nrevenue from the regular UN budget, mostly for international staffing costs.\nIn addition to its regular budget, UNRWA receives funding for emergency\nactivities and special projects, such as in response to the Syrian civil war\nand the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nHistorically, most of the agency's funds came from the United States and the\nEuropean Commission; in 2019, close to 60 percent of its pledge of $1 billion\ncame from EU countries, with Germany being the largest individual donor. The\nnext largest donors were the EU, United Kingdom, Sweden, and the United Arab\nEmirates, followed by Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Qatar, and the Netherlands.\nUNRWA also establishes partnerships with nongovernmental donors, including\nnonprofit \"national committees\" based in donor countries.\n\nThe voluntary nature of UNRWA funding has led to budgetary problems due to\nacute emergencies or political developments in donor countries. In 2009,\nofficials spoke of a \"dire financial crisis\", including a funding shortfall of\n$200 million, in the wake of the Israeli offensive in Gaza. In August 2018,\nthe U.S. ceased its contributions, arguing that UNRWA's mandate should be\nreduced to the few hundred thousand Palestinians alive when the agency was\ncreated. The U.S. decision resulted in the loss of $300 million out of the\n$1.2 billion budget, contributing to an overall deficit of $446 million. The\nshortfall was covered with increased contributions from elsewhere.\n\nUNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini with US Secretary Antony Blinken\nin Amman, Jordan, 4 November 2023\n\nIn mid-2019, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Switzerland temporarily suspended\nfunding to UNRWA, citing ethics report that alleged mismanagement, corruption,\nand discrimination among the agency's leadership. In December 2019, the\nNetherlands restored its funding, increasing its donation by \u20ac6 million for\n2019, to \u20ac19 million. The EU increased its contribution from \u20ac82 million\n($92.2 million) by \u20ac21 million ($23.3 million), and Germany agreed to fund\nfour new UNRWA projects, totaling \u20ac59 million ($65.6 million). Qatar increased\nits donation for Palestinians in Syria by $20.7 million, bringing the 2019\ntotal to $40 million.\n\nThe funding situation for 2019 and beyond was discussed in April at a\n\"Ministerial Strategic Dialogue\" attended by representatives from Egypt,\nFrance, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, Norway, United Kingdom, the European External\nAction Service, and the European Commission. At the annual meeting of the\nGeneral Assembly that year, a high-level ministerial meeting was held\nregarding UNRWA funding. In July 2020 Commissioner-General Lazzarini warned\nthat UNRWA's budget was \"not sustainable\", with shortfalls in four out of the\nfive previous years, and funding at its lowest point since 2012. According to\nthe World Bank, for all countries receiving more than $2 billion in\ninternational aid in 2012, Gaza and the West Bank received a per capita aid\nbudget over double the next largest recipient, at a rate of $495.\n\nIn January 2010, the Government of Canada announced that it was redirecting\naid previously earmarked to UNRWA to projects under the Palestinian Authority.\nPreviously, Canada provided UNRWA with 11 percent of its budget at $10 million\n(Canadian) annually. The decision came despite positive internal evaluations\nof the Agency by CIDA officials. The 2010 Canadian decision put it very much\nat odds with the US and EU, which maintained or increased their levels of\nfunding. Some suggested that the decision also cost Canada international\nsupport in its failed October 2010 effort to obtain a seat on the UN Security\nCouncil. Documents obtained from CIDA revealed that even the government of\nIsrael opposed the Canadian move which had asked Canada to resume\ncontributions to UNRWA's General Fund.\n\nEU suspended funding for UNRWA in January 2024 but reinstated the funding\nlater on March 1, 2024. In 2024, the Swiss National Council voted to cut\nfinding to UNWRA, citing concerns of antisemitism and connections to\nterrorism; the legislation will need to pass Council of States to go into\neffect."

In response, in 2007 the Agency\nlaunched the Infrastructure and Camp Improvement Programme (ICIP) to improve\nspatial and environmental conditions through comprehensive urban planning\nmethods and community engagement. ICIP is implemented differently in each host\ncountry based on local needs, resources, and priorities, albeit with a broader\nfocus on rehabilitating or reconstructing existing shelters, building new\nhousing or service centers, providing maintenance, and improving public\ninfrastructure such as sanitation and water drainage.\n\nFollowing the destruction of much of the Nahr al-Bared refugee camp in\nnorthern Lebanon in 2007, resulting from months of fighting between Fatah al-\nIslam militants and the Lebanese Armed Forces, UNRWA led the initiative to\nrebuild the camp, in what has become the largest project in its history. As of\nApril 2021, nearly two-thirds (72 percent) of the camp has been reconstructed,\nincluding 386 shops and businesses, enabling 3,550 families to return. Special\nfunding has been provided by Saudi Arabia, Japan, the Netherlands, and the\nUnited Arab Emirates."

Administration of the education\n> system for all Palestinian students in the West Bank and Gaza was taken over\n> by the Palestinian Authority. Other Palestinian schools administered by\n> UNRWA in neighboring countries were unaffected. With the end of UNESCO\n> monitoring of the books, UNRWA moved to develop supplementary materials to\n> teach tolerance in the schools it administered.\n\nIt is the PA textbooks used in UNRWA schools in the West Bank, Gaza, and East\nJerusalem that have been most extensively studied. In the beginning, the PA\nused books from Jordan and Egypt. In 2000 it started issuing its own books.\nBrown has pointed out that research into Palestinian textbooks conducted by\nthe Centre for Monitoring the Impact of Peace in 1998 is misleading because it\nevaluates the old books; and in 2000, its research mixed old and new books.\nBrown investigated the differences between the new PA books and the ones being\nreplaced.\n\nRegarding the Palestinian Authority's new textbooks, he states:\n\n> The new books have removed the anti-Semitism present in the older books\n> while they tell history from a Palestinian point of view, they do not seek\n> to erase Israel, delegitimize, it or replace it with the \"State of\n> Palestine\"; each book contains a foreword describing the West Bank and Gaza\n> as \"the two parts of the homeland\"; the maps show some awkwardness but do\n> sometimes indicate the 1967 line and take some other measures to avoid\n> indicating borders; in this respect they are actually more forthcoming than\n> Israeli maps; the books avoid treating Israel at length but do indeed\n> mention it by name; the new books must be seen as a tremendous improvement\n> from a Jewish, Israeli, and humanitarian view; they do not compare\n> unfavorably to the material my son was given as a fourth-grade student in a\n> school in Tel Aviv\".\n\nIn 2002, the United States Congress requested the United States Department of\nState to commission a reputable NGO to conduct a review of the new Palestinian\ncurriculum. The Israel/Palestine Center for Research and Information (IPCRI)\nwas thereby commissioned by the US Embassy in Tel Aviv and the US Consul\nGeneral in Jerusalem to review the textbooks. Its report was completed in\nMarch 2003 and delivered to the State Department for submission to Congress.\nIts executive summary states: \"The overall orientation of the curriculum is\npeaceful despite the harsh and violent realities on the ground. It does not\nopenly incite against Israel and the Jews. It does not openly incite hatred\nand violence. Religious and political tolerance is emphasized in a good number\nof textbooks and in multiple contexts.\"\n\nIPCRI's June 2004 follow-up report notes that \"except for calls for resisting\noccupation and oppression, no signs were detected of outright promotion of\nhatred towards Israel, Judaism, or Zionism\" and that \"tolerance, as a concept,\nruns across the new textbooks\". The report also stated that \"textbooks\nrevealed numerous instances that introduce and promote the universal and\nreligious values and concepts of respect of other cultures, religions, and\nethnic groups, peace, human rights, freedom of speech, justice, compassion,\ndiversity, plurality, tolerance, respect of law, and environmental awareness\".\n\nHowever, the IPCRI noted a number of deficiencies in the curriculum.\n\n> The practice of 'appropriating' sites, areas, localities, geographic\n> regions, etc. inside the territory of the State of Israel as\n> Palestine/Palestinian observed in our previous review, remains a feature of\n> the newly published textbooks (4th and 9th Grade) laying substantive grounds\n> to the contention that the Palestinian Authority did not in fact recognize\n> Israel as the State of the Jewish people. ...\n\nThe summary also states that the curriculum asserts a historical Arab presence\nin the region, while:\n\n> The Jewish connection to the region, in general, and the Holy Land, in\n> particular, is virtually missing. This lack of reference is perceived as\n> tantamount to a denial of such a connection, although no direct evidence is\n> found for such a denial.\" It also notes that \"terms and passages used to\n> describe some historical events are sometimes offensive in nature and could\n> be construed as reflecting hatred of and discrimination against Jews and\n> Judaism.\"\n\nThe US State Department has similarly raised concerns about the content of\ntextbooks used in PA schools. In its 2009 Human Rights report, the US\nDepartment of State wrote that after a 2006 revision of textbooks by the PA\nMinistry of Education and Higher Education, international academics concluded\nthat books did not incite violence against Jews but showed imbalance, bias,\nand inaccuracy. The examples given were similar to those given by IPCRI.\n\nIn 2013 the results of a rigorous study, which also compared Israeli textbooks\nto PA textbooks, came out. The study was launched by the Council for Religious\nInstitutions in the Holy Land, an interfaith association of Jewish, Christian,\nand Muslim leaders in Israel and the Occupied Territories. The study was\noverseen by an international Scientific Advisory Panel and funded by the US\nState Department The Council published a report \"Victims of Our Own\nNarratives? Portrayal of the 'Other' in Israeli and Palestinian School Books\".\nMost books were found to be factually accurate except, for example, through\npresenting maps that present the area from the river to the sea as either\nPalestine or Israel. Israeli schoolbooks were deemed superior to Palestinian\nones with regard to preparing children for peace, although various depictions\nof the \"other\" as enemy occurred in 75% of Israeli, and in 81% of Palestinian\ntextbooks. The study praised both Israel and the Palestinian Authority for\nproducing textbooks almost completely unblemished by \"dehumanizing and\ndemonizing characterizations of the other\". Yet many troubling examples were\ngiven of both sides failing to represent each other in a positive or even\nadequate way. And the problem was more pronounced in PA textbooks.\n\n* Neutral depictions of \"the other\" were found in 4% of Israeli, and 15% of Palestinian textbooks.\n* Overall negative or very negative representations of Palestinians occurred 49% of the time in Israeli state school books (73% in Haredi school books) and in 84% of Palestinian textbooks.\n* Highly negative characterizations were discerned in 26% of Israeli state school books and 50% of the Palestinian ones.\n\nIn response to a critical report[_citation needed_] written in 2009 by former\nUNRWA general counsel James G. Lindsay, fellow researcher for Washington\nInstitute for Near East Policy John Ging, head of UNRWA Gaza, said: \"As for\nour schools, we use textbooks of the Palestinian Authority. Are they perfect?\nNo, they're not. I can't defend the indefensible.\"\n\nUNRWA has taken many steps since 2000 to supplement the PA curriculum with\nconcepts of human rights, nonviolent conflict resolution, and tolerance.\nAccording to the UNRWA website:[_non-primary source needed_]\n\n> We have been delivering human rights education in our schools since 2000 to\n> promote non-violence, healthy communication skills, peaceful conflict\n> resolution, human rights, tolerance, and good citizenship. In May 2012, the\n> Agency endorsed its new Human Rights, Conflict Resolution and Tolerance\n> (HRCRT) Policy to further strengthen human rights education in UNRWA. This\n> policy builds upon past successes, but also draws from international best\n> practices and paves the way to better integrate human rights education in\n> all our schools. The HRCRT Policy reflects the UNRWA mandate of quality\n> education for Palestine refugees and sets out a common approach among all\n> UNRWA schools for the teaching and learning of human rights, conflict\n> resolution and tolerance. The vision of the policy is to \"provide human\n> rights education that empowers Palestine refugee students to enjoy and\n> exercise their rights, uphold human rights values, be proud of their\n> Palestinian identity, and contribute positively to their society and the\n> global community.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Australian and Canadian governments started investigating UNRWA,\nand the British government found that UNRWA had produced and disseminated\ntextbooks inciting violence. UNRWA blocked public access to its website\ncontents in response. Phillipe Lazzarini admitted to the European Parliament\nthat the study materials in UNRWA's schools featured incitement to violence,\nglorification of acts of terror, and antisemitism, but insisted that the\nagency takes steps to prevent the material from being taught.\n\nA review performed in 2024 names using \"host-country textbooks with\nproblematic content\" as one of the issues with UNRWA's neutrality. The review\nstates \"Three international assessments of PA textbooks in recent years have\nprovided a nuanced picture,..Two identified presence of bias and antagonistic\ncontent, but did not provide evidence of antisemitic content. The third\nassessment, by the [German-based] Georg Eckert Institute, studied 156 PA\ntextbooks and identified two examples that it found to display antisemitic\nmotifs but noted that one of them had already been removed, the other has been\naltered.\""

In a letter to the Agency's major\ndonors, he said he was attempting to be honest because UNRWA has over 8,200\nemployees in the Gaza Strip. Given that opinion polls show 30% support of\nHamas in Gaza at the time, and UNRWA's workforce of 11,000 Palestinians, at\nleast some Hamas sympathizers were likely to be among UNRWA's employees. The\nimportant thing, he wrote, was that UNRWA's strict rules and regulations\nensured that its staff remained impartial UN servants. Hansen was retired from\nUnited Nations service against his will on 31 March 2005 after the United\nStates blocked his reappointment.\n\nUNRWA has come under criticism from Hamas for teaching Palestinian students\nWestern values. According to Hazem Balousha, some Hamas officials objected to\nUNRWA organized trips for Palestinian students to visit Holocaust remembrance\nsites. Hamas officials also opposed other UNRWA organized trips for\nPalestinian students to the US and Europe. According to _The Guardian_ , Hamas\nhas in some cases threatened UN staff in Gaza. James G. Lindsay, a former\nUNRWA general counsel and affiliated with the pro-Israel Washington Institute\nfor Near East Policy published a report for WINEP in 2009 in which he said\nUNRWA did not take enough steps to detect and prevent members of Hamas from\njoining the organization.\n\nAccording to _The Jerusalem Post_ , Hamas won a teachers union election for UN\nschools in Gaza in 2009. UNRWA has strongly denied this and pointed out that\n\"Staff elections are conducted on an individual \u2013 not party list \u2013 basis for\nunions that handle normal labour relations \u2013 not political \u2013 issues.\" In\naddition, John Ging, the Gaza head of operations, said in a letter dated 29\nMarch 2009 that employees must not \"be under the influence of any political\nparty in the conduct of their work.\"\n\nIsraeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth stated in 2012 that a staff union election\nresulted in 25 of the 27 seats going to Palestinians who were either Islamist\nor sympathetic towards Hamas. More than 9,500 UNRWA employees in the Gaza\nStrip participated; this represented more than 80% turnout. The professional\nlist won three UNRWA workers groups: the employees', teachers', and services'\nunions. According to the Israeli government , UNRWA employed at least 24\nmembers of Hamas or Islamic Jihad in 24 of its schools; the majority were\nprincipals or deputy principals, and several were fighters in the Qassam\nBrigades. Also, Israel provided intelligence about 18 UNRWA workers it accused\nof participating in the October 7, 2023, attacks.\n\nOn September 30, 2024, UNRWA confirmed that Fatah Sharif, a top Hamas\ncommander killed in an Israeli airstrike in Lebanon, had formerly been on its\npayroll as a school principal and head of the teachers' union in Lebanon.\nUNRWA said it had suspended Sharif and started an investigation in March when\nit learned of the allegation that Sharif was a member of the political wing of\nHamas. It was not aware that he was a Hamas commander. Hamas praised him\nposthumously for his \"educational and jihadist work.\" In February 2025, former\nhostage Emily Damari alleged she was held in a UNRWA facility for some of her\n15-month captivity by Hamas. UNRWA said there were times when it did not have\naccess to its facilities and that most were converted to shelters. It called\nfor an independent investigation into the misuse of its facilities."

But, he noted, while Israeli officials\nprivately argued for its abolishment, with no other credible party able to\ntake over the agency's duties, including administering the more than 200,000\nGazans internally displaced during the then-ongoing 2014 Gaza War, Israel had\nnever \"launched a no-holds-barred effort to bring UNRWA down\". That changed\nafter the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, as Horovitz described in a January\n2025 piece titled \"Gaza after UNRWA\". In addition to cataloguing ties between\nUNRWA and Hamas, including revelations of its staff's \"complicity in the mass\nmurder in Israel that caused the war and devastation in Gaza\", Horovitz\nexcoriated the agency for having \"perpetuated a fundamental intolerance for\nthe simple fact of Israel\u2019s existence\" and having \"helped Hamas and by\nextension doomed Gaza\"."

In 2024, during the Gaza war, the Biden\nadministration halted funding for UNRWA after the Israeli government alleged\nthat some UNRWA staffers took part in the October 7 attacks."

No mention is made of\nthe occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nUNRWA's Jerusalem spokesperson Chris Gunness stated that UNRWA rejects\nLindsay's report and its findings and said that the study was inaccurate and\nmisleading, since it \"makes selective use of source material and fails to\npaint a truthful portrait of UNRWA and its operations today\".\n\nIn response to the criticism of his report from UNRWA, Lindsay writes:\n\n> Despite repeated requests from the author, the agency declined to identify\n> the alleged weaknesses on the grounds that \"our views\u2014and understanding\u2014of\n> UNRWA's role, the refugees and even U.S. policy are too far apart for us to\n> take time (time that we do not have) to enter into an exchange with little\n> likelihood of influencing a narrative which so substantially differs from\n> our own.\" Thus, the paper has not benefited from any input by UNRWA, whether\n> a discussion of policy or even correction of alleged errors."
