The alliance was formed with the express purpose of improving\nregional integration and moving toward complete freedom in the movement of\ngoods, services, capital and people between the four member states. Together,\nthese four countries have a combined population of more than 230 million\npeople and make up roughly 35 percent of Latin American GDP."

On 28 April 2011, then president of Peru Alan Garc\u00eda\norganized a meeting with the presidents of Chile, Colombia and Mexico at the\ntime. This working group issued the _Declaraci\u00f3n de Lima_ , a statement of\nintent to establish the Pacific Alliance. The initial goal of the alliance was\nto further free trade with \"a clear orientation toward Asia\" and regional\neconomic integration.\n\nTogether, the four member states of the Pacific Alliance represent nearly 35\npercent of Latin American GDP. If it were counted as a single country, the\nPacific Alliance would have a nominal GDP of US$2.02 trillion (US$4.32\ntrillion at PPP GDP rates), making it the 9th (or 7th) largest economy in the\nworld. According to the World Trade Organization, the countries of the Pacific\nAlliance together exported roughly US$680 billion in 2019, almost twice as\nmuch as Mercosur, the other predominant Latin American trade bloc.\nIndividually and collectively, the core countries of the Pacific Alliance have\nbeen deemed \"The Pacific Pumas\" by political scientists, for their model of\neconomic and political development.[_citation needed_]\n\nAt the VII Pacific Alliance Summit in Cali, Colombia, on 22 May 2013, Costa\nRica signed a trade agreement with Colombia, and later in the summit received\napproval for full membership from all the founding members. Costa Rica is\nfinishing up the process so it can be readily incorporated as the Alliance's\nfifth member. At the same summit seven observers were admitted: the Dominican\nRepublic, Ecuador, El Salvador, France, Honduras, Paraguay, Portugal, among\nothers."

These three stock markets began their\nintegration in November 2010; this made it Latin America's largest market\naccording to number of issuers, the second by market capitalization, and the\nthird by turnover.\n\nThe Mexican Stock Exchange began the process of incorporation into MILA and\nits full incorporation was expected by the year 2014. The Mexican Stock\nExchange took the step of acquiring a total of 3.79 million shares of the Lima\nStock Exchange (BVL), equivalent to 6.7 percent of the shares of Series A of\nthat market. This is part of an agreement for a strategic partnership in order\nto develop joint business activities and development of the stock markets of\nPeru and Mexico, and eventually complete integration into MILA.\n\nThe Mexican Stock Exchange met the timeframe and announced the first trade\nmade as part of MILA on 2 December 2014. The trade on MIILA was a $1,415\npurchase of 200 shares in Chilean retailer Falabella, executed by GBM Mexico\nthrough GBM Chile. With the entry of Mexico into MILA, the integrated stock\nmarket now counts 780 issuers among the four countries, making it the biggest\nmarket by number of listed companies in Latin America, and the biggest in\nterms of market capitalization, according to the World Federation of\nExchanges.

However the Canadian\ngovernment has yet to upgrade its _observer_ status to _observer-candidate_ as\nit is still determining whether or not to become a member.\n\nCosta Rica began the process of joining on 10 February 2014 at the eighth\nsummit of the Alliance in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, when President Laura\nChinchilla signed a protocol at a plenary session finalizing the decision to\njoin the alliance. The country had since postponed its incorporation into the\nalliance indefinitely, pending consultations by its presidential economic\ncouncil. However, on 8 July 2022, President Rodrigo Chaves Robles announced\nthat Costa Rica had applied to become a full member of the Alliance.\n\nEcuador has been critical of the alliance in conjunction with other leaders of\nALBA, but its president, Rafael Correa, has also speculated on a possible\nfuture bid if integration advances in areas other than trade.\n\nGuatemala has expressed concrete interest in joining the Pacific Alliance and\nis pursuing trade deals with current members as a precursor to a possible\nmembership application.\n\nPanama has expressed interest in joining the Alliance, and is an official\nobserver-candidate according to the website. Panama has already signed trade\ndeals with Colombia, Peru and Chile, and reached an agreement with Mexico to\nsign a free-trade deal in March 2014. While fulfilling most of the criteria to\nenter in the alliance, the country has so far refused to commit itself to full\nmembership.\n\nParaguay, a founding member of Mercosur and observer of the Pacific Alliance,\nhas begun pursuing free-trade deals with current members as a precursor to a\npossible membership application. Paraguay was suspended from Mercosur\nfollowing the impeachment of Fernando Lugo, although Paraguay asked Mercosur\nto lift the sanction. After the election and inauguration of Horacio Cartes,\nParaguay has so far claimed \"Paraguay would not abandon Mercosur\", but assured\nit will seek to join the alliance. The government has said it is reportedly\nconsidering joining the Pacific Alliance in addition to rejoining Mercosur.\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden expressed that the United States was willing to\njoin the Pacific Alliance as an observer on 23 May 2013, in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia,\nduring a bilateral meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.\n\nArgentine President Mauricio Macri, during his campaign and in press\nconferences after the election, has expressed his desire to bring his country\ncloser to the Pacific Alliance and also work on integration between the bloc\nand his country's trade bloc Mercosur.\n\nUruguay has been encouraged to join the alliance by existing members Peru and\nColombia, and is reportedly considering the possibility of accession.\n\nHonduras officially applied for formal membership in October 2016, with the\nvocal support of Chile."
