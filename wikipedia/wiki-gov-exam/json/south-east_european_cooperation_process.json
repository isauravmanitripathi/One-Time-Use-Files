At the Bulgaria-chaired meeting in Sofia, the\nSoutheast Europe (SEE) countries laid the foundations for regional co-\noperation for the purposes of creating an atmosphere of trust, good\nneighbourly relations and stability.\n\nA special characteristic of SEECP is that it is an original form of co-\noperation among the countries in the region launched on their own initiative,\nand not on the initiative of some other international organisation or\ncountries. In that regard, the SEECP seeks to define itself as an authentic\nvoice of SEE, complementary to the Stability Pact, Southeast European\nCooperative Initiative or the Stabilisation and Association Process.\n\nThe basic goals of regional co-operation within SEECP include the\nstrengthening of security and the political situation, intensification of\neconomic relations and co-operation in the areas of human resources,\ndemocracy, justice, and battle against illegal activities. It is the intention\nof the SEECP to enable its members to approach the European and Euro-Atlantic\nstructures through the strengthening of good neighbourly relations and\ntransformation of the region into an area of peace and stability."
