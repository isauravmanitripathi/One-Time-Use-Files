        "generated_section_content_md": "ICARDA's origins began in April 1972 when the Technical Advisory Committee of\nCGIAR (then known as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural\nResearch) expressed interest in agricultural research in the Near East and\nNorth Africa. TAC identified the semi-arid winter rainfall zone of the region\nas an important ecological area with specific crops and significant\nagricultural challenges which were not adequately addressed by any of the\ninternational agricultural research centers at the time. TAC selected\nProfessor Dunstan Skilbeck to head a study during March and April 1973. The\nSkilbeck Mission recommended the establishment of a new agricultural research\ncenter to deal with the agricultural issues of the region. TAC recommended the\nestablishment of an international center in Lebanon.\n\nThe eruption of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975 prevented the establishment of\na center in Lebanon. The President of Syria Hafez al-Assad who had hoped to\nsecure his own country's agriculture by working with this new institution made\nan attractive offer of free land for the center to the south of Aleppo. In\n1977, ICARDA's headquarters were established in Tel Hadya, Syria.\n\nToday ICARDA's research activities include the development of new crop\nvarieties, water harvesting, conservation agriculture, the diversification of\nproduction systems, integrated crop/rangeland/livestock production systems,\nand the empowerment of rural women.\n\nICARDA was forced to re-locate again in 2012 due to the Syrian civil war. The\ncenter established headquarters in Beirut after leaving Aleppo in 2012.\n\nA seed bank at the ICARDA station in Terbol, Lebanon holds around 40,000 seed\nsamples\u2014compared to 150,000 in Syria"
