        "generated_section_content_md": "Formation of international cooperation among African States\n\nThe **Economic Community of West African States** (**ECOWAS** ; also known as\n**CEDEAO** in French and Portuguese) is a regional political and economic\nunion of twelve countries of West Africa. Collectively, the present and former\nmembers comprise an area of 5,114,162 km2 (1,974,589 sq mi) and have an\nestimated population of over 424.34 million.\n\nConsidered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide African\nEconomic Community (AEC), the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve \"collective\nself-sufficiency\" for its member states by creating a single large trade bloc\nby building a full economic and trading union. Additionally, ECOWAS aims to\nraise living standards and promote economic development. The union was\nestablished on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of Lagos, with its\nstated mission to promote economic integration across the region. A revised\nversion of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993 in Cotonou, the\nlargest city in Benin.\n\nECOWAS's published principles include equality and inter-dependence of member\nstates, solidarity, self-reliance, cooperation and harmonization of policies,\nnonaggression, promotion of human rights, economic and social justice, and\ndemocratic governance.\n\nNotably among ECOWAS's protocols and plans are the ECOWAS Free Movement of\nPersons, Residences and Establishment Protocol and the Ecotour Action Plan\n2019\u20132029. The _Free Movement of Persons Protocol_ permits citizens the right\nto enter and reside in any member state's territory, and the _Ecotour Action\nPlan_ aims to develop and integrate the tourist industry of each member state.\n\nECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, with member states\noccasionally sending joint military forces to intervene in the bloc's member\ncountries at times of political instability and unrest.\n\nIn 2024, the military governments of Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali jointly\nannounced their withdrawal from the bloc, after having been suspended\nfollowing respective military takeovers in these countries. The withdrawal\ntook effect on 29 January 2025. The three later went on to form the Alliance\nof Sahel States, with the end goal of establishing a federation."

The application\nwas endorsed in principle at the Summit of Heads of State in June 2017.\nHowever, Morocco's bid for membership was stalled as West African economic\nactors feared goods imported through Morocco's free trade agreements would\nflood the market of states within ECOWAS."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Arabic-speaking Mauritania was one of the founding members of ECOWAS in 1975\nand decided to withdraw in December 2000. Mauritania signed a new associate-\nmembership agreement in August 2017.\n\nMali was suspended from ECOWAS on 30 May 2021, following its second military\ncoup within nine months. Guinea was also suspended on 8 September 2021,\nshortly after a military coup took place in the country. Sanctions were placed\non both countries on 16 September. On 10 January 2022, Mali announced its\ndecision to close its borders and recalled several ambassadors with ECOWAS in\nresponse to sanctions imposed for deferring elections for four years. On 28\nJanuary 2022, Burkina Faso was suspended from ECOWAS following a military\ncoup. Niger was suspended from ECOWAS after the 2023 coup d'\u00e9tat and\nthreatened with military intervention if President Mohamed Bazoum was not\nrestored to office, causing the Nigerien crisis. Additionally, ECOWAS closed\nall land and air borders between other member states and Niger and instituted\na no-fly zone on all commercial flights to and from Niger. The suspension\nremoved all commercial and financial transactions and froze Niger's assets in\nECOWAS central banks. On 16 September 2023, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso\nformed a military alliance, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), following\nECOWAS's threat to intervene to restore civilian rule in Niger. On 21 November\n2023, Niger's military government asked the ECOWAS regional court to order the\nlifting of sanctions imposed on the country. Until the coup, aid from\ncountries like the United States and international organizations like ECOWAS\naccounted for almost half of Niger's annual budget. Following Niger's ECOWAS\nsuspension, Niger's neighbours closed their borders to the country and 70\npercent of its electricity, coming from Nigeria, was cut off. While these\nsanctions and consequences that have followed have affected the individuals\nand economy of Niger, the government is not backing down. As a result of the\nsuspension, children have not been able to attend school due to lack of\nsupplies, and businesses are shutting down due to rising costs. Further, the\nECOWAS lawyer pointed out that the Nigerien government is not recognized by\nECOWAS and therefore does not have the power to ask the regional court for a\nremoval of these sanctions.\n\nOn 28 January 2024, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso announced via a joint\nstatement that they were withdrawing from ECOWAS \"without delay\". The three\nnations, all of which are currently ruled by military juntas, accused ECOWAS\nof implementing \"inhumane\" sanctions in order to reverse the coups in each\nnation. Under the ECOWAS protocol, immediate withdrawal is not possible, and\nthe three member states could remain in the bloc for up to a year. ECOWAS said\nin a statement that \"Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali remain important members of\nthe Community and the Authority remains committed to finding a negotiated\nsolution to the political impasse.\"\n\nOn 24 February 2024, ECOWAS announced that it was lifting some sanctions\nagainst Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso. For Niger this included the border\nclosures, the freezing of central bank and state assets, the suspension of\ncommercial transactions, and the no-fly-zone for commercial flights to and\nfrom Niger. However, the political sanctions and targeted sanctions would\nremain in force. The communiqu\u00e9 said this was done for humanitarian reasons,\nbut it was seen as a gesture of appeasement to dissuade the three junta-led\nstates from withdrawing from the bloc. ECOWAS also lifted sanctions on Guinea\nand Guinea-Bissau.\n\nIn December 2024, ECOWAS heads of state of the member countries met to\nfinalize the decision regarding the withdrawal of Mali, Niger and Burkina\nFaso, united under the AES. President of Senegal, Basirou Diomaye Faye, stated\non 8 December 2024 that he was continuing to discuss with the three countries\nremaining in ECOWAS, while maintaining the Alliance of Sahel States, which he\nrecognized as a security response in the Sahel region. On 12 December 2024,\nECOWAS President Bola Tinubu confirmed the political will of ECOWAS leaders to\nreintegrate the three countries from the Alliance of Sahel States. On 15\nDecember 2024, the Conference of Heads of State of ECOWAS adopted an exit\ntransition period for Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali, which begins on 29 January\n2025 and ends on 29 July 2025. During this transition period, ECOWAS has\nindicated that any exit would be reversible. The AES rejected the\nproposal.[_citation needed_] Celebrations were held in the three countries to\nmark the formal exit on 29 January. ECOWAS noted the withdrawal, while calling\nfor the continuance of existing arrangements for the free movement of people\nand goods, including requesting its own members still accept documents from\nthe departing countries.\n\nThe Foreign Ministers of the Alliance of Sahel States met on 26 January 2025,\nin Ouagadougou \"in anticipation of future talks with ECOWAS\", The Ministers\nreached a consensus on the overall approach to future negotiations with\nECOWAS, in the best interest of the Sahelian populations. From 29 January\n2025, begins the beginning of a six-month \"transition period\" after the\nofficial separation with the three Sahelian countries. The three Sahelian\ncountries rejected any possibility of reversing their decision.\n\nIn June 2025, the heads of state of ECOWAS will meet to finalize the\nformalities for the countries' exit from the alliance of Sahel states.\n\nECOWAS member states  Country  | Area\n(km2) | Population\n(thousands) | GDP (nominal)\n(millions USD) | GDP (PPP)\n(millions intl.$) | Currency  | Official\nlanguage  | Status\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\nBenin | 114,763 | 10,880 | 8,291 | 22,377 | CFA franc | French | \u2014\nCape Verde | 4,033 | 521 | 1,603 | 3,413 | escudo | Portuguese | \u2014\nThe Gambia | 11,295 | 1,991 | 939 | 3,344 | dalasi | English | \u2014\nGhana | 238,533 | 27,410 | 37,543 | 115,409 | cedi | English | \u2014\nGuinea | 245,857 | 12,609 | 6,699 | 15,244 | franc | French | Suspended\nGuinea-Bissau | 36,125 | 1,844 | 1,057 | 2,685 | CFA franc | Portuguese | \u2014\nIvory Coast | 322,463 | 22,702 | 31,759 | 79,766 | CFA franc | French | \u2014\nLiberia | 111,369 | 4,503 | 2,053 | 3,762 | dollar | English | \u2014\nNigeria | 923,768 | 211,400 | 481,066 | 1,093,921 | naira | English | \u2014\nSenegal | 196,712 | 15,129 | 13,610 | 36,625 | CFA franc | French | \u2014\nSierra Leone | 72,300 | 6,453 | 4,215 | 10,127 | leone | English | \u2014\nTogo | 56,785 | 7,305 | 4,088 | 10,667 | CFA franc | French | \u2014\n**Total** | **2,334,003** | **322,747** | **592,923** | **1,397,340** | \u2014\n\nStatistics for population, nominal GDP and purchasing power parity GDP listed\nbelow are taken from World Bank estimates for 2015, published in December\n2016.

        "generated_section_content_md": "ECOWAS was formed initially from the region's former French, British and\nPortuguese colonies, and independent Liberia, following post-colonial\nindependence throughout the region (particularly in the 1960s and 1970s). At\nindependence, many African states were challenged in increasing economic\ndevelopment. Because these states could not address problems individually,\nthere was a need for a regional approach and thus ECOWAS was founded. ECOWAS\nwas formed to provide regional economic cooperation, but has since evolved to\ninclude political and military cooperation, as well.\n\nThe union was established on 28 May 1975, with the signing of the Treaty of\nLagos, with its stated mission to promote economic integration across the\nregion. A revised version of the treaty was agreed and signed on 24 July 1993\nin Cotonou. Considered one of the pillar regional blocs of the continent-wide\nAfrican Economic Community (AEC), the stated goal of ECOWAS is to achieve\n\"collective self-sufficiency\" for its member states by creating a single large\ntrade bloc by building a full economic and trading union.\n\nECOWAS also serves as a peacekeeping force in the region, with member states\noccasionally sending joint military forces to intervene in the bloc's member\ncountries at times of political instability and unrest. ECOWAS facilitates\npeacekeeping through systematic collaboration with civil society, cooperation\nwith development policies, and other activities with the goal to meet sub-\nregional security challenges. It has played an important role in monitoring\ntransitional election in West Africa, and these mediation efforts have even\nbeen recognized within and outside the continent of Africa. In recent years\nthese included interventions in Ivory Coast in 2003, Liberia in 2003, Guinea-\nBissau in 2012, Mali in 2013, The Gambia in 2017, and Guinea-Bissau in 2022.\nSince its creation, ECOWAS has sent peacekeeping forces seven times.\n\nIn 2011, ECOWAS adopted its development blueprint for the next decade, _Vision\n2020_ , and, to accompany it, a Policy on Science and Technology (ECOPOST).\nHowever, it has had trouble achieving the goals outlined in the policy.\n\nCovering a region known as a \"coup belt\", ECOWAS, since the 1990s, has\nattempted to defend the region's shift towards democracy against authoritarian\nattacks. According to the BBC, since 1990, 78% of the 27 coups in sub-Saharan\nAfrica have taken place in former French colonies. This has led some to\nquestion whether French influence in Africa has a destabilising effect. The\ntransition governments in Mali and Burkina Faso cancelled military agreements\nthat allow for French troops to operate on their territory, and in the case of\nMali, removed French as an official language. However, the group has been\ncited for mild and ineffective responses in the early 2020s, when three member\ncountries experienced military coups d'\u00e9tat \u2013 two in Mali, one in Guinea, and\ntwo in Burkina Faso. When a fourth member, Niger, experienced a coup d'\u00e9tat in\nJuly 2023, ECOWAS was vocal in its condemnation and raised the possibility of\nmilitary action if the deposed president was not reinstated by 7 August 2023.\nDue to the Nigerien military's refusal to restore civilian rule, ECOWAS\nactivated its standby force composed of all other members except for Mali,\nBurkina Faso, Guinea and Cape Verde.\n\nOn 6 July 2024, the military leaders of Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso signed a\nnew pact to form a confederation, a political union of sovereign states. The\nconfederation's stated goal is to provide mutual defense, pool resources to\nbuild energy and communications infrastructure, establish a common market,\nimplement a monetary union under proposed currency _the Sahel_ , allow free\nmovement of persons, enable industrialization, and invest in agriculture,\nmines and energy sectors, with the end goal of federalizing into a single\nsovereign state. The move is seen as a strong move away from ECOWAS, which has\nbeen pressing for a return to civilian rule."

Apart from Guinea, which is francophone, they are\nall English-speaking countries. Along with Mauritania, Guinea opted out of the\nCFA franc currency shared by all other former French colonies in West and\nCentral Africa.\n\nThe WAMZ attempts to establish a strong stable currency to rival the CFA\nfranc, whose exchange rate is tied to that of the euro and is guaranteed by\nthe French Treasury. The eventual goal is for the CFA franc and eco to merge,\ngiving all of West and Central Africa a single, stable currency. The launch of\nthe new currency is being developed by the West African Monetary Institute\nbased in Accra, Ghana.\n\nWith the exit of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso from the body, two structural\noptions for a single currency could emerge: the \"Sahel\" for the AES and the\n\"Eco\" for the ECOWAS member countries."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In May 1979, ECOWAS adopted a Free Movement of Persons, Residence and\nEstablishment Protocol, which permits citizens to enter, reside, and establish\neconomic activities in the territory of member states. There were three phases\nof implementation to achieve the goals of the protocol. Over the course of\nfive years, Phase I eliminated the need for visas for stays of up to 90 days\nwithin the ECOWAS territory. Phase II attempted to extend residency to\ncitizens in host ECOWAS states to seek income-earning employment after\nobtaining an ECOWAS residence card. Phase II also required member states to\ngrant migrant workers equal treatment in areas such as employment,\nparticipation, social and cultural activities, and in certain cases of job\nloss, re-employment, and training. Phase III centered on the facilitation and\nestablishment of business through the right of citizens to manage economic\nactivities in countries other than their country of origin. However, this\nright has not been fully established in the ECOWAS region. While these three\nphases promoting freedom of movement within the ECOWAS region is more advanced\nthan in any other regional grouping in Africa, only the first phase has been\nfully implemented by all ECOWAS countries. The complete implementation of the\n90-day visa-free window enhanced human mobility in the region, creating\npositive effects on trade and economic development.\n\nIn December 2000, the ECOWAS passport was introduced as a common passport that\nfunctions as an international travel document, and member states are currently\nin the process of implementing a joint visa for non-ECOWAS citizens.\nAdditionally, ECOWAS has worked to ease the movement of people transported in\nprivate and commercial vehicles by implementing policies that enable vehicles\nto enter and reside in a State for up to ninety days. Most ECOWAS states have\ninstituted an ECOWAS brown card, which provides prompt, fair, and immediate\ncompensation for any motor accident which occurs outside a motorist's home-\ncountry.\n\nWhile monitoring committees exist to ensure all three phases of the protocol\nare successfully implemented, their work is vague and has not been credited\nwith effective and efficient production of data. The largest challenges\nassosicated within the implementation of the protocol occur due to lack of\ncommitment and enforceability. More so, there is a lack of access to readily\navailable migrant information in the ECOWAS region. This poses a barrier to\nfreedom of movement as immigration officials in member states are unaware that\nindividuals who hold valid travel documents can enter their country freely.\nTherefore, West African migrants, who are entitled to enter through regular\nchannels, leave their countries without proper travel documents and enter\nother countries illegally. This illegal and irregular entry poses a barrier\ntowards gaining reliable travel statistics.\n\nFor example, Francophone countries in the region have issued national identity\ncards that can be used similarly to a passport. These cards permit citizens to\ncross borders after presenting their identity cards. However, Anglophone\ncountries have only just begun distributing a similar form of identification.\nConsequently, immigration officials in Anglophone countries commonly reject\nFrancophone national identity cards and do not permit Francophone citizens to\ncross into their borders. Further, these structural barriers are exasperated\nbetween different social classes. Middle-class individuals typically\nexperience a smoother border-crossing process than working-class individuals\nand impoverished citizens who do not have travel documents and are not fluent\nin the language of the countries they are crossing into."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 2019, ECOWAS unveiled its Ecotour Action Plan 2019 \u2013 2029. It focuses on\ntourism heritage protection and development and on the development of\nstandards, regulations, and control systems. The plan includes five programs\nfor implementation, and detailed mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation.\nEcotourism is not specifically developed, yet it has been mentioned that the\nprogram has the opportunity to create linkages between institutions and\nstakeholder collaboration to suit ecotourism projects that prioritize\ncommunity, biodiversity, and socioeconomics. The Ecotour Plan prioritizes\nlocal development, especially in generating skilled and unskilled jobs for\nmarginalized individuals, and aims to make the ECOWAS region a first-class\ntourist destination in Africa. During its creation, ECOWAS ministers also\ncalled on ecotourism programs to protect threatened biodiversity in the\nGuinean Forests, which span into seven ECOWAS member states. Similar to the\nFree Movement of People Protocol, Ecotour aims to integrate aviation and\nground transportation. ECOWAS hopes that this regional approach will allow\nstates to fight against pandemics such as COVID-19 to restore tourism and\necosystems. Ecotour works to create increasing returns to its members'\neconomies by lowering transport costs, developing hospitality training centers\nand creating a more integrated use of digital technology.\n\nAs of March 2023, Council members mentioned that phases one and two of the\nEcotour Action Plan have come to an end and that the community is moving into\nphase three and four, which focuses on the development of tourist\naccommodations establishments, and a proposal for a regional mechanism to\nenforce tourist regulations. By the end of phase five, ECOWAS hopes to have\nunified accommodations in hotels, ecolodges, motels, apart hotels, and\nhostels. In April 2023, tourism experts met to amend the new text for tourist\naccommodations in the ECOWAS region. This phase is critical to the success of\nthe Ecotour plan as the lack of a regulatory system has been a barrier to the\ndevelopment of the tourism sector, despite its ability to increase member\nstates' economies. During this conference, ministers improved the tourism\nindustry by adopting standards for hotel services. Mrs. Massandj\u00e9 Toure-Liste,\nthe ECOWAS Commission's Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture,\npointed out the improvements in the tourist sector due to the African\nContinental Free Trade Area, a trade agreement signed by 44 members of the\nAfrican Union which creates a single market for goods and services. Mrs.\nToure-Liste praised the trade area for providing development opportunities,\neconomic growth, and boosting regional integration."

        "generated_section_content_md": "ECOWAS has emerged as a key regional actor in the movement to repatriate\ncultural property removed during colonial and post-colonial conflicts. In\n2019, its Ministers of Culture adopted a Regional Action Plan for the return\nof African cultural artefacts to their countries of origin, marking a formal\ncommitment to correct historical injustices and to safeguard regional\nheritage.\n\nWest Africa\u2019s museums, palaces and sacred sites suffered extensive plunder\nunder European colonial regimes. Artefacts ranging from royal regalia to\nritual objects were extracted and dispersed across Europe and North America.\nThis loss of cultural patrimony weakened local identities and deprived future\ngenerations of tangible links to their past. By the late twentieth century,\nECOWAS member states recognised that repatriating such objects was essential\nto restoring cultural continuity and promoting tourism and education in the\nregion.\n\nIndividual member states initiated bilateral requests for return of artefacts\nas early as the 1960s, but these efforts often lacked coordination and\nleverage. In December 2018, ECOWAS Heads of State adopted a Political\nDeclaration in Abuja instructing the Commission to develop a regional\nmechanism for repatriation, reflecting a consensus that joint action would\ncarry greater weight in negotiations with former colonial powers. Critics\nwarned that without legal force, the plan risked being a symbolic gesture.\n\nOn 17 July 2019 in Cotonou, Benin, ECOWAS Ministers of Culture validated the\n2019\u20132023 Regional Action Plan for the return of cultural artefacts. The Plan\nsets out six strategic objectives, including establishing a legal framework,\nmobilising financing, strengthening governance and mapping artefact\ninventories held abroad. In May 2021, ECOWAS Commissioner Mamadou Traor\u00e9 led\nadvocacy talks with Liberian authorities to encourage ratification of the 1970\nUNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on cultural property,\nunderscoring ECOWAS\u2019s role in driving member-state compliance with\ninternational norms."
