        "generated_section_content_md": "CTA is mainly funded by the European Union. It initially focused on\ninformation dissemination but, more recently, has moved towards implementing\nsome technical programmes. It works primarily with partner organisations at\nregional level in the Caribbean and Pacific and at sub-regional level in\nAfrica. CTA celebrated its 30th anniversary in Brussels on 4 April 2014. The\ncentre, which is based in Wageningen, the Netherlands, is active in seventy\nnine ACP countries. It also has an office in Brussels. Although it does not\nwork in non-ACP countries, participants from these countries are welcome to\nattend its annual conferences and to download its publications.

        "generated_section_content_md": "CTA focuses on three key areas:\n\n* **Multi-stakeholder policy formulation and implementation at national, regional and international levels.** Discussion of issues such as food and nutritional security, the impact of climate change on agriculture, regional trade, and agricultural innovation is promoted, with an emphasis on the involvement of farmers\u2019 groups, the private sector, women and youth. CTA works with policy-makers in the ACP and the EU to promote dialogue and convey key policy messages.\n* **Efficient agricultural value chains.** With partners in ACP countries, CTA works to maximize inclusion of smallholders in new, more sophisticated value chains as well as to strengthen their involvement in priority food crop and commodity markets. Improving market information, promoting the flow of finance to and through value chains, and improving capacity of key players at all stages of chains are some of the centre's priority areas, as is the development of agricultural trade by ACP countries [2] Archived 2017-03-04 at the Wayback Machine.\n* **Information, communication and knowledge management** for agricultural and rural development. To help ACP institutions to promote policies and innovations that can benefit rural communities, CTA publishes both journals and books (including online) and has many specialized websites. It works with ACP countries to develop knowledge management skills and to promote the use of communication channels, old and new, to improve the flow of information (e.g., e-communities, web portals, seminars, and study visits). It has an active programme of training and development for ICT for Development and web 2.0 for Development. It offers a wide range of publications (in English and French) available free of charge to organisations in ACP countries or for free download by all [3]."
