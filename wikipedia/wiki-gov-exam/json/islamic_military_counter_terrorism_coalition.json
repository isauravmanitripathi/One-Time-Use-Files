        "generated_section_content_md": "IMCTC has stated that its primary objective is to protect Muslim countries\nfrom all terrorist groups and terrorist organizations irrespective of their\nsect and name. The IMCTC affirmed that it would operate in line with the\nUnited Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) provisions on\nterrorism.\n\nAt the press conference to launch the IMCTC, Mohammad bin Salman said it would\n\"coordinate\" efforts to fight terrorism in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and\nAfghanistan. He said, \"There will be international coordination with major\npowers and international organisations ... in terms of operations in Syria and\nIraq.\"\n\nThe alliance does not include any countries with Shia-dominated governments,\nsuch as Iran, Iraq and Syria. According to a Euronews report, some analysts\nsee formation of the alliance as part of Saudi Arabian efforts to take the\nleading role in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in rivalry with Iran.\nDue to the dominance of the alliance by states having majority Sunni Muslim\npopulations, it has been called \"a sectarian coalition\" by Hakeem Azameli, a\nmember of the Security and Defense Commission in the Iraqi parliament.\n\nHowever, Oman, an Ibadi-dominant country has joined the alliance. Lebanon has\nalso supported the alliance. Other countries who are part of the alliance or\nsupport it that have cordial or friendly relations with Iran include\nBangladesh, Kuwait, Libya, and Pakistan.[_citation needed_]\n\nIn March 2016, it was reported that Saudi Arabia had asked the then Pakistani\nChief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif, to become commander of the ICMTC once he\nhad retired from the Pakistan Army at the end of 2016."
