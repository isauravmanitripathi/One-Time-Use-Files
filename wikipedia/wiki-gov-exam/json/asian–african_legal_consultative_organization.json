        "generated_section_content_md": "International governmental organization\n\nThe **Asian\u2013African Legal Consultative Organization** (**AALCO**) is an\ninternational governmental organization formed in 1956, initially to serve as\nan advisory board to member states on matters on international law. It was an\noutgrowth of the Bandung Conference, held in Indonesia during April, 1955,\nwhich led to the establishment of the **Asian Legal Consultative Committee**\n(ALCC). In April, 1958, it changed its name to the **Asian-African Legal\nConsultative Committee** (**AALCC**) to reflect the growth of its membership\nbeyond the African side of the United Arab Republic. Since 2001, it has been\nknown by its current name, the AALCO, reflecting the growth of its\ninternational status; currently an intergovernmental organization having\nreceived a standing United Nations invitation to participate as an observer in\nthe sessions and the work of the General Assembly and maintaining a permanent\noffice at Headquarters.\n\nIn 2014, the **AALCO** established an Informal Expert Group on Customary\nInternational Law. That group adopted a set of comments on the work of the\nInternational Law Commission on identification of customary international law.\nThose comments and the report of the AALCO Special Rapporteur Sienho Yee are\npublished on the website of the AALCO."

Its Centers provide the opportunities for training of\narbitrators as well. The Directors of the Centres, who are from amongst\nlawyers familiar to arbitration, are appointed by suggestion of the host\ngovernments and ratification of the Secretary-General of **AALCO**.
