UNAIDS seeks to prevent the HIV/AIDS epidemic from becoming a severe\npandemic.\n\nUNAIDS is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, where it shares some site\nfacilities with the World Health Organization. It is a member of the United\nNations Development Group. Currently, Winnie Byanyima leads UNAIDS as\nexecutive director. Former executive directors are Peter Piot (1995\u20132008) and\nMichel Sidib\u00e9 (2009\u20132019).\n\nUNAIDS regularly publishes articles and reports on the status of the AIDS\nepidemic, including roadmaps to ending HIV as a public health threat and\nupdates on the current scientific findings on vaccines and treatments for HIV\ninfections and AIDS.\n\nThe agency promotes the GIPA principle (greater involvement of people living\nwith HIV) formulated in 1994, and endorsed by the United Nations in 2001 and\n2006."

        "generated_section_content_md": "It is widely believed that HIV first crossed over from chimpanzees to humans\nin the 1920s through humans eating chimps infected with simian\nimmunodeficiency virus (SIV), a virus similar to HIV, in what is now the\nDemocratic Republic of Congo. Scientific and medical research determined the\nchimps hunt and eat two smaller monkey species red-capped mangabeys and\ngreater spot-nosed monkeys which carried two strains of SIV which combined\nthrough infection and transmission into \"SIVcpz\", a virus almost identical to\nHIV, which eventually spread to humans.\n\nThe first \"verified\" case of HIV was detected retrospectively using a blood\nsample from 1959 from a man living in what is now the Democratic Republic of\nCongo, albeit there are believed to be numerous other HIV cases prior based on\nobserved symptoms and patterns of death."

In 1982, the CDC adopted the term\nAIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. From 1981 to 1985, doctors around\nthe world in countries such as Belgium and France, and African countries,\nZaire, Congo, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia noted they had observed and treated\nmedical cases with similar symptoms as HIV/AIDS in the 1970s. In 1985, the CDC\nhosted the First International Conference on AIDS in Atlanta."

        "generated_section_content_md": "As Lindsay Knight summarises the understanding and outlook of the early 1980s\nin her report, _UNAIDS: The first ten years, 1996\u20132006_ : \"No one could have\nimagined that a few cases of rare diseases damaging the immune system would\nherald a pandemic that has killed more than all those who died in battle\nduring the whole of the twentieth century.\" However, views with respect to the\nspeed and success of the initial response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and crisis\nare mixed.\n\nThe global response to the HIV/AIDS crisis was initially led by the US based\nCenter for Disease Control which discovered the first HIV/AIDS case. A 2011\nreport \"AIDS: the Early Years and the CDC's Response\", makes the case that it\nis due to the CDC's rapid and effective approach, and staff, that the virus\nwas even discovered in the first place. The report further argues that the\nCDC's approach, along with partnerships with the US Food and Drug\nAdministration, and the National Institutes of Health, are the reason that\ninitial recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and containment were\ndeveloped, issued and disseminated so quickly (within 1\u20132 years of first\nreported case), The report states that the CDC's \"excellent surveillance,\nrapid identification, innovative science, committed persons\", among other\nfactors help to \"illustrate the power of epidemiologic investigation in\nunderstanding and preventing new diseases, even in the absence of an\nidentified cause\" and that the \"CDC's reputation and staff accomplishments led\nto the formation of the Global AIDS program.\"\n\nCritics of the global response to the HIV/AIDS crisis prior to UNAIDS assert\nthat the initial response was slow, faltering, negligent, and exacerbated the\ncrisis which could have been contained more expeditiously if it were not for\nfailures of leadership, missed opportunities, wasted time, among other\nfactors. One book which examines the global response, and describes both the\npositive and negative aspects states that during the first fifteen years of\nthe HIV/AIDS crisis, \"most of the world's leaders, in all sectors of society,\ndisplayed a staggering indifference to the growing challenge of this new\nepidemic.\" It explains that a combination of factors \u2013 (1) biases and\nstereotyped views that those ill were only from stigmatized communities such\nas sex workers, men who have sex with men, drug users, migrants, among others,\nas well as (2) political issues such as countries not wanting to admit there\nwas a crisis and taking steps to block journalists and media reports on the\nbreakout, (3) politicians falsely believing that the disease was limited to\nlower income countries with less developed medical and healthcare systems, and\nsome politicians fear of associating their own country with sex and death \u2013\nall led to a slow response, and low levels of funding for research, treatment,\nand support at a time when greater actions could have been taken. Other\nreasons for delays include some scientists dismissing concerns about HIV/AIDS\nbecoming a global pandemic as unnecessarily alarmist."

Initially, when allegations surfaced in mid-2018,\nSidibe refused to quit. In response to heightened scrutiny and reports of his\ngross mismanagement, however, Sidibe informed the agency's board on 13\nDecember 2018 that he would leave his post in June 2019.\n\nA panel of independent experts released a report on 13 December 2018 saying\nSidibe was overseeing a \"patriarchal\" workplace and promoting a \"cult of\npersonality\" centred on him as the all-powerful chief. The experts further\nsaid the situation could not be changed unless Sidibe, a native of Mali who\nhas headed the UN agency for nine years, resigned.\n\nOne official with ties to senior management at the UNAIDS Geneva secretariat\nalso noted, under Sidibe's leadership, that \"UNAids mirrors the whole UN as a\n'boys club' with hierarchical and patriarchal culture of discrimination, lack\nof transparency and accountability that enables harassment.\"\n\nSidibe denied claims that he tried to force an employee to drop allegations\nthat she was sexually assaulted by his former deputy. Despite the scathing\nreport, he insisted he was the right man to turn around the organisation, a\nclaim which had been roundly rejected.[_by whom?_]"

This calls for increases in both the number of\nnew actors, as well as in innovative ways of working, to facilitate increased\ncapacity of non-state entities to respond effectively to the epidemic at all\nlevels.\n\nWith the momentum generated by the UN Special Session on HIV/AIDS, the main\nchallenges are to:\n\n* Sustain and deepen involvement of those contributing and critical to the response such as PLWHA organizations\n* Move beyond the organizations already involved and reach out to optimally engage a broad range of sectors/actors.\n\nUNAIDS has collaborated with the Roman Catholic Church, especially Caritas\nInternationalis, in the fight against AIDS, something which materialized in a\nDecember 2005 message by Pope Benedict XVI. However, it indicated in a 2009\ncommuniqu\u00e9 that it did not agree with the Pope's statement that condoms were\nunhelpful in AIDS prevention, instead calling them \"essential\"."

To fulfil\nthis mandate, UNAIDS is supported by voluntary contributions from governments,\nfoundations, corporations, private groups (for example, students,\nuniversities, sporting clubs, etc.) and individuals.\n\nIn 2003, more than US$118.5 million was received from 30 governments,\nphilanthropic organizations, individuals from around the world and others.

In\n2021, US$ 171.4 million in core funding was made available by twenty-seven\ngovernments, with the US leading donating $45,000,000, followed by Sweden and\nthe Netherlands.
