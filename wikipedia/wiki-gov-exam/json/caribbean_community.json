        "generated_section_content_md": "CARICOM, originally The Caribbean Community and Common Market, was established\nby the Treaty of Chaguaramas which took effect on 1 August 1973. Founding\nstates were Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.\n\nThe Caribbean Community superseded the 1965\u20131972 Caribbean Free Trade\nAssociation organised to provide a continued economic linkage between the\nEnglish-speaking countries of the Caribbean after the dissolution of the West\nIndies Federation, which lasted from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962.\n\nA revised Treaty of Chaguaramas established _The Caribbean Community including\nthe CARICOM Single Market and Economy_ and was signed by the CARICOM Heads of\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community on 5 July 2001 at their Twenty-Second\nMeeting of the Conference in Nassau, The Bahamas. The revised treaty cleared\nthe way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the Caribbean\n(CARICOM) Single Market and Economy.\n\nHaiti's membership in CARICOM remained effectively suspended from 29 February\n2004 through early June 2006 following the 2004 Haitian coup d'\u00e9tat and the\nremoval of Jean-Bertrand Aristide from the presidency. CARICOM announced that\nno democratically elected government in CARICOM should have its leader\ndeposed. The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly\nfrom Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which\ninfuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, G\u00e9rard Latortue, who announced\nhe would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM. CARICOM thus voted on\nsuspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of\nCARICOM. Following the presidential election of Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val, Haitian officials\nwere readmitted and Pr\u00e9val himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM\nCouncil of Ministers meeting in July.\n\nSince 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to\nthe European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements signed in 2008 known\nas CARIFORUM. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and\nCARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of\nthe agreement, the European Court of Justice handles dispute resolution\nbetween CARIFORUM and European Union states."

English was its sole\nworking language into the 1990s. The organisation became multilingual with the\naddition of Dutch and Sranan Tongo-speaking Suriname in 1995 and the French\nand Haitian Creole-speaking Haiti in 2002. Furthermore, it added Spanish as\nthe fourth official language in 2003. In July 2012, CARICOM announced they\nconsidered making French and Dutch official languages. In 2001, the Conference\nof Heads of Governments signed a revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that cleared\nthe way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the CARICOM\nSingle Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty establishes and\nimplements the Caribbean Court of Justice. Its primary activities involve:\n\n* Coordinating economic policies and development planning.\n* Devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction.\n* Operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market).\n* Handling regional trade disputes."

The Commission advocated both deepening\nthe integration process (through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) and\ncomplementing it through a separate regional organisation encompassing all\nstates in the Caribbean.\n\nCARICOM accepted the commission's recommendations and opened dialogue with\nother Caribbean states, the Central American states and the Latin American\nnations of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico which border the Caribbean, for\nconsultation on the proposals of the West Indian Commission.\n\nAt an October 1993 summit, the heads of state and government of CARICOM and\nthe presidents of the then-Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela)\nformally decided to create an association grouping all states of the Caribbean\nbasin. A work schedule for its formation was adopted. The aim was to create\nthe association in less than a year, an objective which was achieved with the\nformal creation of the ACS."

The flag was first flown on 4 July 1984 in Nassau, The Bahamas at\nthe fifth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government.\n\nThe flag features a blue background, but the upper part is a light blue\nrepresenting sky and the lower, a darker blue representing the Caribbean Sea.\nThe yellow circle in the centre represents the sun on which is printed in\nblack the logo of the Caribbean Community, two interlocking Cs. The two Cs are\nin the form of broken links in a chain, symbolising both unity and a break\nwith the colonial past. The narrow ring of green around the sun represents the\nvegetation of the region."
