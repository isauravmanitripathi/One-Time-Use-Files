        "generated_section_content_md": "Intergovernmental body to regulate mineral-related activities on the seabed\n\nThe **International Seabed Authority** (**ISA** ; French: _Autorit\u00e9\ninternationale des fonds marins_) is a Kingston, Jamaica-based\nintergovernmental body of 167 member states and the European Union. It was\nestablished under the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and\nits 1994 Agreement on Implementation. The ISA's dual mission is to authorize\nand control the development of mineral related operations in the international\nseabed, which is considered the \"common heritage of all mankind\", and to\nprotect the ecosystem of the seabed, ocean floor and subsoil in \"The Area\"\nbeyond national jurisdiction. The ISA is responsible for safeguarding the\ninternational deep sea, defined as waters below 200 meters (656 feet), where\nphotosynthesis is hampered by inadequate light. Governing approximately half\nof the total area of the world's oceans, the ISA oversees activities that\nmight threaten biological diversity and harm the marine environment.\n\nSince its inception in 1994, the ISA has approved over two dozen ocean floor\nmining exploration contracts in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. The\nmajority of these contracts are for exploration in the Clarion\u2013Clipperton zone\nbetween Hawaii and Mexico, where polymetallic nodules contain copper, cobalt\nand other minerals essential for powering electric batteries. To date, the\nAuthority has not authorized any commercial mining contracts as it continues\nto deliberate over regulations amid global calls for a moratorium on deep sea\nmining. Scientists and environmentalists warn that such mining could wreak\nhavoc on the ocean, a crucial carbon sink and home to rare and diverse\nspecies.\n\nFunded by UNCLOS members and mining contractors, the Authority operates as an\nautonomous international organization with its own Assembly, Council, and\nSecretariat. The current secretary-general of the agency is Leticia Carvalho,\nwhose four-year term began on 1 January 2025."

In its original form, the Convention included certain\nprovisions that some found objectionable, such as:\n\n* Use of collected money for wealth redistribution in addition to ISA administration\n* Mandatory technology transfer\n\nBecause of these concerns, the United States pushed for modification of the\nConvention, obtaining a 1994 Agreement on Implementation that somewhat\nmitigates them and thus modifies the ISA's authority.

Papua New Guinea was the first country in the world to\ngrant commercial exploration licenses for seafloor massive sulphide deposits\nwhen it granted the initial license to Nautilus Minerals in 1997. Japan's new\nocean policy emphasizes the need to develop methane hydrate and hydrothermal\ndeposits within Japan's exclusive economic zone and calls for the\ncommercialization of these resources within the next 10 years. Reporting on\nthese developments in his annual report to the Authority in April 2008,\nSecretary-General Nandan referred also to the upward trend in demand and\nprices for cobalt, copper, nickel and manganese, the main metals that would be\nderived from seabed mining, and he noted that technologies being developed for\noffshore extraction could be adapted for deep sea mining.\n\nRecently, there has been much interest in the possibility of exploiting seabed\nresources in the Arctic Ocean, bordered by Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway,\nRussia and the United States (see Territorial claims in the Arctic). In 2020,\nan international coalition of environmental groups urged the government of\nNorway to not only abandon plans for deep sea mining under national\njurisdiction, but to also speak out against DSM Arctic mining before the\nInternational Seaboard Authority."
