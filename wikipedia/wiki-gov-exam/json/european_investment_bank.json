It is the largest multilateral\nfinancial institution in the world. The EIB finances and invests both through\nequity and debt solutions companies and projects that achieve the policy aims\nof the European Union through loans, equity and guarantees.\n\nThe EIB focuses on the areas of climate, environment, small and medium-sized\nenterprises (SMEs), development, cohesion and infrastructure. It has played a\nlarge role in providing finance during crises including the 2008 financial\ncrisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 60 years since its inception in 1958 to\n2018 the EIB has invested over 1.1 trillion euros. It primarily funds projects\nthat \"cannot be entirely financed by the various means available in the\nindividual Member States\".\n\nThe EIB is one of the biggest financiers of green finance in the world. In\n2007, the EIB became the first institution in the world to issue green bonds.\nIn 2019 it committed to stop funding fossil fuel projects by the end of 2021.\nThe EIB plans to invest 1 trillion euros in climate-related projects by 2030\nincluding a just transition. The EIB is not funded through the budget of the\nEU. Instead, it raises money through the international capital markets by\nissuing bonds. The EIB is rated triple-A, the most credit-worthy rating on the\nbond market, by \"the Big Three\" credit rating agencies: Moody's, Standard and\nPoor's, and Fitch. Each member state pays capital into the EIB's reserves\nwhich is broadly in line with their share of EU gross domestic product.\n\nThe EIB was founded by the Treaty of Rome, which came into force on 1 January\n1958. It was the first of the world's regional development banks and is\nsometimes referred to as the largest multilateral development bank (MDB). The\nEIB was established to facilitate equitable development in the EU through\nlending to regions that are less developed and to support the EU's internal\nmarket. The EIB is active in 140 countries throughout the world. It makes\naround 10% of its investments outside the EU to support the European Union's\ndevelopment aid and cooperation policies.\n\nThe EIB has been criticised and caused controversy for various actions and\ninactions of its own (or projects it funded), including: insufficient\nstakeholder consultation, lack of organisational transparency, climate change\nresponse, defence and promotion of vegetarian and vegan values, tax avoidance,\nand staff harassment."

In some cases, the EIB provides direct\nquasi-equity financing to support companies aiming for financing to grow which\ninvolves venture debt products for European companies in the field of biotech\nand life sciences, software and ICT, engineering and automation, renewables\nand clean technology. These investments, which are a relatively recent\naddition to the bank's work, tend to be smaller than its previous limits on\nthe size of its deals, because they are aimed at startups and growth\ncompanies. The European Investment Fund (EIF) supports the EIB by working with\nSMEs and related financial partners (banks, guarantee, leasing and\nmicrofinance institutions, private equity and venture capital funds etc.).\n\nThe EIB's investments in equity and debt funds usually cover 10% to 20% of the\nfund size (with a maximum of 25%) and address climate action, infrastructure,\nor private sector development and social impact goals."

Both parties agree on a fixed date when the loan is due to be paid back\nusually including an interest rate. The EIB's bonds are purchased by retail\ninvestors and institutional investors around the world.\n\nThe EIB focuses on long-term investment and is triple-A rated by Moody's,\nStandard and Poor's, and Fitch. This allows the bank to borrow money at lower\nrates to then lend it at lower rates to projects inside and outside Europe\nthat foster EU policy objectives.\n\nIn addition to benchmark bonds, public bonds, and private placements that vary\nin terms of size, currencies, maturities, and structures, the bank offers\nGreen Bonds and Sustainability Awareness Bonds.\n\nThe European Investment Bank issued the first Green Bond in 2007, called a\nClimate Awareness Bond. The EIB is the global leader of Green Bonds issuance\nwith over EUR 30.8bn raised in 2020 across 16 currencies. With the money\nraised through Green Bonds, the EIB exclusively supports projects that\ncontribute to climate action in the renewable energy sector (including wind,\nhydroelectric, solar and geothermal energy production) and the energy\nefficiency sector (e.g. projects for district heating, co-generation, and\nbuilding insulation)."
