The project, started in 1994, was originally\nknown as Prevention and Management of Marine Pollution in the East Asian Seas\n(SDS-SEA).\n\nPEMSEA is currently being hosted by the Philippines' Department of Environment\nand Natural Resources and holds its office in the DENR compound in Quezon\nCity, Philippines."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In December 1993, several integrated coastal management (ICM) pilot sites were\nestablished, including Xiamen (PR China) and Batangas Bay (Philippines), which\nhelped start efforts in addressing marine pollution problems in the Straits of\nMalacca and Straits of Singapore; and increasing capacity development in the\nregions of Cambolia, China, DPR Korea, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and\nViet Nam. A second phase of the Project, implemented between 1999 and 2007,\nwas supported by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), focused on building\npartnerships between stakeholders. The project was renamed to PEMSEA to\nreflect the new thrust of the programme.\n\nIn 2003, participating governments and stakeholders of the organization issued\nSustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia (SDS-SEA) to\npromote a common vision in the area of sustainable development in the region.\nIn 2007, PEMSEA committed itself to implementing the SDS-SEA as a part of\nPhase I project (2007-2017). The latest phase's aim is to make PEMSEA a self-\nsustaining regional operating mechanism.\n\nPEMSEA's areas of work include coastal and ocean governance, natural and man-\nmade hazard prevention and management, habitat protection, restoration and\nmanagement, water use and supply management, pollution and waste reduction\nmanagement, as well as food security and livelihood management.\n\nOne of the important tasks that PEMSEA assumes is turning the knowledge about\nregional coastal into action that can improve the status quo. PEMSEA\ncapitalizes on its broad intergovernmental, financial and intellectual\nresources to come up with the best solutions problems of sustainable coastal\nmanagement."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Every three years, PEMSEA hosts the East Asian Seas Congress that consists of\na Ministerial Forum, an International Conference and other events. The\nconference focuses on tracking progress of SDS-SEA, encourages knowledge\nexchange and raises important issues regarding coastal management in the\nregion. It also tries to engage private sector in helping develop sustainable\nfinancial and business solutions to coastal management problems. The first\nEast Asian Seas Congress was held in December 2003 in Putrajaya, Malaysia. It\nwas organized following the recommendations of the World Summit on Sustainable\nDevelopment (WSSD) with the goal to improve situation related to coasts and\noceans. The following two congresses were held in Haikou City, Hainan\nProvince, PR China, in the year 2006 and in Philippines in the year 2009. The\n2012 congress was held with the theme \"Building a Blue Economy: Strategy,\nOpportunities, and Partnerships in the Seas of East Asia\" in July 2012 in\nChangwon City, the Republic of Korea."
