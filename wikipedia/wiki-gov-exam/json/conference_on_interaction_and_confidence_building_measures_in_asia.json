It is a forum based on the\nrecognition that there is a close link between peace, security and stability\nin Asia and in the rest of the world. The key idea of the Conference is based\non the priority of the indivisibility of security, joint initiative and\nmutually beneficial interaction of small and large states.\n\nThe idea of convening the CICA was first proposed by Kazakhstan President\nNursultan Nazarbayev on 5 October 1992, at the 47th Session of the United\nNations General Assembly. On October 5, 2017, the CICA process celebrated its\n25th anniversary."

During the next seven years, a series of meetings were held among\nthe interested countries to discuss modalities of convening the CICA and draft\nbasic documents.\n\nThe first meeting of the CICA Ministers of Foreign Affairs was held on 14\nSeptember 1999 with participation of 15 Member States. _The Declaration on\nPrinciples Guiding Relations between CICA Member States_ was adopted at this\nmeeting.\n\nThe first CICA summit was held on 4 June 2002 with participation of 16 Member\nStates and _Almaty Act_ , the charter of the CICA, was adopted.

At the second CICA Summit in 2006, it was decided to admit Thailand\nand Republic of Korea as new members and to establish a permanent secretariat.\nAt the third meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs in 2008, Jordan and UAE\nwere admitted as new members.
