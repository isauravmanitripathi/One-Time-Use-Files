At the seventh summit in Riga on 20 June 2022, Ukraine\nreceived the status of a partner-participant of the TSI, _de facto_ becoming a\nparticipant in this initiative. At the 2023 summit, Greece became a member and\nMoldova a partner-participant, while at the 2025 summit, Albania and\nMontenegro became partner-participants."

It was seen as a Polish attempt to create its\nsphere of influence (similar to the historical perception of Intermarium).\nFurther fears were related to a possibility of deepening the east\u2013west\ndivision in the EU and exclusion of Germany. A long term Czech objection was\nthat there should be no competing geopolitical project in the region that\nwould weaken the EU. Some of those objections have been partially addressed\nlately also due to a good experience with cooperation on infrastructure\nprojects in the Visegr\u00e1d Group.[_verification needed_] Further improvement of\nCzech position toward the Initiative happened after the term of the president\nMilo\u0161 Zeman ended and the government could remove from the Czech priority list\nthe controversial project of Danube-Odra-Labe channel in 2023. The Ministry of\nforeign affairs suggested the new priority projects should be the gas\nconnection STORK II and high-speed rail connection to Poland. On the other\nhand, Czechia still does not seem interested in joining the Investment fund or\nhosting a summit."

It was also noted that Ukraine is\nalready cooperating in the construction of the trans-European Via Carpatia\nhighway, and is discussing an ambitious E-40 waterway project for Ukraine.\"\n\nIn October 2019, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said that Ukraine\ncould not now join the Three Seas Initiative, as it includes the countries of\nCentral and Southern Europe, which are members of the European Union. The head\nof Polish diplomacy explained that the Three Seas Initiative should not be\nassociated with geopolitics, as it is only an infrastructure project.\n\nIn November 2019, during the visit of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr\nZelenskyy to Estonia, he stated that Ukraine is interested in joining the TSI\nand intends to discuss this issue with Estonian partners.\n\nAfter the start of the 2022 Russian invasion during the Russian-Ukrainian War,\nPresident of Poland Andrzej Duda in his address to the Verkhovna Rada of\nUkraine on 22 May 2022, stated that Ukraine should join the Three Seas\nInitiative. Later, on 7 June 2022, the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz\nMorawiecki, at the opening of a two-day congress of local self-government in\nthe Three Seas in Lublin, stated that the Three Seas Initiative is impossible\nwithout involving a free and sovereign Ukraine.\n\nAt the seventh summit in Riga on 20 June 2022, speaking on video, the\nPresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine should become a\nmember of the Three Seas Initiative. Zelenskyy suggested strengthening the\ninterpretation of cooperation within the Three Seas, emphasizing the\nimportance of logistics. Speaking about cooperation in the energy sector,\nZelenskyy reminded that Ukraine has one of the largest gas storage facilities\nin the region. At this summit Ukraine received the status of a partner-\nparticipant of the TSI, _de facto_ becoming a participant in this initiative."
