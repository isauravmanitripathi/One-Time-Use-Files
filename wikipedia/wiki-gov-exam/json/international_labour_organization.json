        "generated_section_content_md": "Specialized agency of the United Nations\n\nThe **International Labour Organization** (**ILO**) is a United Nations agency\nwhose mandate is to advance social and economic justice by setting\ninternational labour standards. Founded in October 1919 under the League of\nNations, it is one of the first and oldest specialized agencies of the UN. The\nILO has 187 member states: 186 out of 193 UN member states plus the Cook\nIslands. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with around 40 field\noffices around the world, and employs some 3,381 staff across 107 nations, of\nwhom 1,698 work in technical cooperation programmes and projects.\n\nThe ILO's standards are aimed at ensuring accessible, productive, and\nsustainable work worldwide in conditions of freedom, equity, security and\ndignity. They are set forth in 189 conventions and treaties, of which eight\nare classified as fundamental according to the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental\nPrinciples and Rights at Work; together they protect freedom of association\nand the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the\nelimination of forced or compulsory labour, the abolition of child labour, and\nthe elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. The\nILO is a major contributor to international labour law.\n\nWithin the UN system the organization has a unique tripartite structure: all\nstandards, policies, and programmes require discussion and approval from the\nrepresentatives of governments, employers, and workers. This framework is\nmaintained in the ILO's three main bodies: The International Labour\nConference, which meets annually to formulate international labour standards;\nthe Governing Body, which serves as the executive council and decides the\nagency's policy and budget; and the International Labour Office, the permanent\nsecretariat that administers the organization and implements activities. The\nsecretariat is led by the Director-General, Gilbert Houngbo of Togo, who was\nelected by the Governing Body in 2022.\n\nIn 2019, the organization convened the Global Commission on the Future of\nWork, whose report made ten recommendations for governments to meet the\nchallenges of the 21st century labour environment; these include a universal\nlabour guarantee, social protection from birth to old age and an entitlement\nto lifelong learning. With its focus on international development, it is a\nmember of the United Nations Development Group, a coalition of UN\norganizations aimed at helping meet the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nTwo milestones in the history of the ILO were the Treaty of Versailles in\n1919, establishing the International Labour Organization, Article 427. And\nsecondly, the Declaration of Philadelphia in 1944, reestablishing the ILO\nunder the United Nations and reaffirming the first principle that \"labour is\nnot a commodity\"."

With the end of the world war in\nsight, it sought to adapt the guiding principles of the ILO \"to the new\nrealities and to the new aspirations aroused by the hopes for a better world.\"\nIt was adopted at the 26th Conference of the ILO in Philadelphia, United\nStates of America.\n\nIn 1946, when the ILO's constitution was being revised by the General\nConference convened in Montreal, the Declaration of Philadelphia was annexed\nto the constitution and forms an integral part of it by Article 1. Most of the\ndemands of the declaration were a result of a partnership of American and\nWestern European labor unions and the ILO secretariat.\n\n\"Labour is not a commodity\" is the principle expressed in the preamble to the\nInternational Labour Organization's founding documents. It expresses the view\nthat people should not be treated like inanimate commodities, capital, another\nmere factor of production, or resources. Instead, people who work for a living\nshould be treated as human beings and accorded dignity and respect. Paul\nO'Higgins attributes the phrase to John Kells Ingram, who used it in 1880\nduring a meeting in Dublin of the British Trades Union Congress."

The core members all\nknew one another from earlier private professional and ideological networks,\nin which they exchanged knowledge, experiences, and ideas on social policy.\nPre-war \"epistemic communities\", such as the International Association for\nLabour Legislation (IALL), founded in 1900, and political networks, such as\nthe socialist Second International, were a decisive factor in the\ninstitutionalization of international labour politics.\n\nIn the post-World War I euphoria, the idea of a \"makeable society\" was an\nimportant catalyst behind the social engineering of the ILO architects. As a\nnew discipline, international labour law became a useful instrument for\nputting social reforms into practice. The utopian ideals of the founding\nmembers\u2014social justice and the right to decent work\u2014were changed by diplomatic\nand political compromises made at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, showing\nthe ILO's balance between idealism and pragmatism.\n\nOver the course of the First World War, the international labour movement\nproposed a comprehensive programme of protection for the working classes,\nconceived as compensation for labour's support during the war.[_clarification\nneeded_] Post-war reconstruction and the protection of labour unions occupied\nthe attention of many nations during and immediately after World War I. In\nGreat Britain, the Whitley Commission, a subcommittee of the Reconstruction\nCommission, recommended in its July 1918 Final Report that \"industrial\ncouncils\" be established throughout the world. The British Labour Party had\nissued its own reconstruction programme in the document titled _Labour and the\nNew Social Order_. In February 1918, the third Inter-Allied Labour and\nSocialist Conference (representing delegates from Great Britain, France,\nBelgium and Italy) issued its report, advocating an international labour\nrights body, an end to secret diplomacy, and other goals. And in December\n1918, the American Federation of Labor (AFL) issued its own distinctively\napolitical report, which called for the achievement of numerous incremental\nimprovements via the collective bargaining process."

The\nBern meeting would consider both the future of the IFTU and the various\nproposals which had been made in the previous few years. The IFTU also\nproposed including delegates from the Central Powers as equals. Samuel\nGompers, president of the AFL, boycotted the meeting, wanting the Central\nPowers delegates in a subservient role as an admission of guilt for their\ncountries' role in bringing about war. Instead, Gompers favoured a meeting in\nParis which would consider President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points only as\na platform. Despite the American boycott, the Bern meeting went ahead as\nscheduled. In its final report, the Bern Conference demanded an end to wage\nlabour and the establishment of socialism. If these ends could not be\nimmediately achieved, then an international body attached to the League of\nNations should enact and enforce legislation to protect workers and trade\nunions."

Subsequently, the Allied Powers agreed that clauses should be\ninserted into the emerging peace treaty protecting labour unions and workers'\nrights, and that an international labour body be established to help guide\ninternational labour relations in the future. The advisory Commission on\nInternational Labour Legislation was established by the Peace Conference to\ndraft these proposals. The Commission met for the first time on 1 February\n1919, and Gompers was elected as the chairman.\n\nSamuel Gompers (right) with Albert Thomas, 1918\n\nTwo competing proposals for an international body emerged during the\nCommission's meetings. The British proposed establishing an international\nparliament to enact labour laws which each member of the League would be\nrequired to implement. Each nation would have two delegates to the parliament,\none each from labour and management. An international labour office would\ncollect statistics on labour issues and enforce the new international laws.\nPhilosophically opposed to the concept of an international parliament and\nconvinced that international standards would lower the few protections\nachieved in the United States, Gompers proposed that the international labour\nbody be authorized only to make recommendations and that enforcement be left\nup to the League of Nations. Despite vigorous opposition from the British, the\nAmerican proposal was adopted.\n\nGompers also set the agenda for the draft charter protecting workers' rights.\nThe Americans made 10 proposals. Three were adopted without change: That\nlabour should not be treated as a commodity; that all workers had the right to\na wage sufficient to live on; and that women should receive equal pay for\nequal work. A proposal protecting the freedom of speech, press, assembly, and\nassociation was amended to include only freedom of association. A proposed ban\non the international shipment of goods made by children under the age of 16\nwas amended to ban goods made by children under the age of 14. A proposal to\nrequire an eight-hour work day was amended to require the eight-hour work day\n_or_ the 40-hour work week (an exception was made for countries where\nproductivity was low). Four other American proposals were rejected. Meanwhile,\ninternational delegates proposed three additional clauses, which were adopted:\nOne or more days for weekly rest; equality of laws for foreign workers; and\nregular and frequent inspection of factory conditions.\n\nThe Commission issued its final report on 4 March 1919, and the Peace\nConference adopted it without amendment on 11 April. The report became Part\nXIII of the Treaty of Versailles."

The tensions produced by these\nchanges in the world environment negatively affected the established politics\nwithin the organization and they were the precursor to the eventual problems\nof the organization with the USA.\n\nIn July 1970, the United States withdrew 50% of its financial support to the\nILO following the appointment of an assistant director-general from the Soviet\nUnion.

Further, it can involve\ninterfering with their schooling by depriving them of the opportunity to\nattend school, obliging them to leave school prematurely, or requiring them to\nattempt to combine school attendance with excessively long and heavy work.\n\nThe ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC)\nwas created in 1992 with the overall goal of the progressive elimination of\nchild labour, which was to be achieved through strengthening the capacity of\ncountries to deal with the problem and promoting a worldwide movement to\ncombat child labour. The IPEC currently has operations in 88 countries, with\nan annual expenditure on technical cooperation projects that reached over\nUS$61 million in 2008. It is the largest programme of its kind globally and\nthe biggest single operational programme of the ILO.\n\nThe number and range of the IPEC's partners have expanded over the years and\nnow include employers' and workers' organizations, other international and\ngovernment agencies, private businesses, community-based organizations, NGOs,\nthe media, parliamentarians, the judiciary, universities, religious groups and\nchildren and their families.\n\nThe IPEC's work to eliminate child labour is an important facet of the ILO's\nDecent Work Agenda. Child labour prevents children from acquiring the skills\nand education they need for a better future.\n\nThe ILO also hosts a Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour\nevery four years.

During the interwar years, the issue was mainly considered a\ncolonial phenomenon, and the ILO's concern was to establish minimum standards\nprotecting the inhabitants of colonies from the worst abuses committed by\neconomic interests. After 1945, the goal became to set a uniform and universal\nstandard, determined by the higher awareness gained during World War II of\npolitically and economically motivated systems of forced labour, but debates\nwere hampered by the Cold War and by exemptions claimed by colonial powers.\nSince the 1960s, declarations of labour standards as a component of human\nrights have been weakened by government of postcolonial countries claiming a\nneed to exercise extraordinary powers over labour in their role as emergency\nregimes promoting rapid economic development.\n\nRatifications of the ILO's 1930 Forced Labour Convention, with non-ratifiers\nshown in red\n\nIn June 1998, the International Labour Conference adopted a Declaration on\nFundamental Principles and Rights at Work and its follow-up that obligates\nmember states to respect, promote and realize freedom of association and the\nright to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or\ncompulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour, and the\nelimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.\n\nRatifications of the ILO's 1957 Abolition of Forced Labour Convention, with\nnon-ratifiers shown in red\n\nIn November 2001, following the publication of the InFocus Programme's first\nglobal report on forced labour, the ILO's governing body created a special\naction programme to combat forced labour (SAP-FL), as part of broader efforts\nto promote the 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work\nand its follow-up.

        "generated_section_content_md": "From the moment its creation in the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the ILO has\nbeen concerned with the controversial issue of commercial sex. Prior to the\ncreation of the ILO and League of Nations, the issue of sex work had been\nexclusively under the jurisdiction of the state, now, the ILO and League of\nNations believed the issue transcended borders and within their jurisdiction.\nIn the early twentieth, commercialized sex was considered both immoral and\ncriminal activity. Initially, the ILO strongly believed prostitution was\nlinked to vulnerable single working women emigrating to other nations without\nbeing under the paternal supervision of a man. After the widespread\ndestruction caused by World War I, the ILO saw prostitution as spreading\ncontagion requiring regulation. Under the leadership of the French socialist\nAlbert Thomas, the ILO created a medical division whose primary focus was on\nmale sailors whose lives were viewed as \"nomadic\" and \"promiscuous\", which\nmade these men susceptible to infection of STD's. After the conclusion of the\nGenoa maritime conference in 1920, the ILO proclaimed itself as the critical\nleader of the prevention and treatment of STD's in sailors. In the interwar\nyears, the ILO also sought to protect female workers in dangers trades, but\ndelegates to ILO Conferences did not consider the sex trade to be \"work\",\nwhich was conceived of as industrial labor. The ILO believed that if women\nworked industrial jobs, this would be a deterrent from them living immoral\nlives. In order to make these industrial jobs more attractive, the ILO\npromoted better wages and safer working conditions, both intended to prevent\nwomen from falling victim to the temptation of the sex trades.\n\nFollowing the creation of the United Nations, the ILO took a back seat to the\nnewly formed organization on the issue of commercialized sex. The UN\nCommission on the Status of Women called for abolishing both sex trafficking\nand prostitution. In the 1950s, the UN Economic and Social Council and the\nInternational Police Organization sought to end any activity that resembled\nslavery, classifying sex trafficking and prostitution as criminal rather than\nlabor issues.\n\nBeginning in 1976, the ILO and other organizations began to examine the\nworking and living conditions of rural women in developing countries. One\nexample the ILO investigated was the go-go bars and the growing phenomenon of\n_hired wives_ in Thailand, which both thrived because the development of U.S.\nmilitary bases in the region. In the late 1970s, the ILO established the\n_Programme on Rural Women_ , which investigated the involvement of young\nmasseuses in the sex trade in Bangkok. It was critical because it was the\nfirst time in the history of the ILO or any of its branches that prostitution\nwas described as a form of labor. In the decades that followed, the increase\nin sex tourism and the exploding AIDS epidemic strengthened ILO interest in\nthe commercial sex trade."
