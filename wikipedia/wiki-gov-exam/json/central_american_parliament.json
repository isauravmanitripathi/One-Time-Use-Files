Although the Contadora group was disbanded in 1986, the idea of\na greater Central American integration remained, giving rise to the Esquipulas\nII Agreement, which among other things, created the Central American\nParliament. The Treaty establishing the Central American Parliament and other\npolitical bodies was signed in 1987; its first formal session was carried out\non 28 October 1991 in Guatemala City.\n\nThe PARLACEN as a political body in the region is part of the Central American\nIntegration System (SICA), established by the Protocol of Tegucigalpa to the\nCharter of the Organization of American States (ODECA) signed on 13 December\n1991. SICA has the fundamental aim to realize an integration that is political\nand ideological representative in a pluralistic democratic system that\nguarantees free elections and participation under equal conditions for\npolitical parties.\n\nThe historic Declaration of Esquipulas I, which was adopted by the presidents\nof the Central American states in the city of Esquipulas, Guatemala on 25 May\n1986, included the following declaration: \"It is necessary to establish and\ncomplement activities that support understanding and cooperation with\ninstitutional structures. They shall make possible to strengthen the dialogue,\nthe common development, democracy and pluralism as fundamental elements for\npeace in the region and the integration of Central America. Therefore the\nfoundation of PARLACEN is necessary. Its members are elected freely by\nuniversal and direct elections through which the principle of political and\nparticipative pluralism is followed.\"\n\nThe agreement of PARLACEN and other political authorities was signed in\nOctober 1987 by Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras.\nIn the beginning, it was an instrument which came into force for only three\nstates (Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras) on 1 May 1990. PARLACEN was\nformed on 28 October 1991 and has its head office in Guatemala City,\nGuatemala.\n\nThe Legislative Yuan, Taiwan's legislative body, was granted permanent\nobserver status at PARLACEN in 1999. However PARLACEN signaled a shift in\napproach when on 28 April 2022 it made a statement to support a One China\npolicy. The following year, on 21 August 2023, the PARLACEN Plenary Assembly\nvoted to revoke the permanent observer status of Taiwan's legislative body and\ninclude China's National People's Congress as a permanent observer instead.\nThe vote was made at the request of the Nicaraguan delegation which argued\nthat \"Taiwan lacks recognition as a sovereign state at the United Nations\" and\nthat the \"observer status that Taiwan holds at PARLACEN is illegitimate due to\nlack of legal status\", also noting a UN resolution concerning Chinese\nrepresentation at the UN. The Chinese government welcomed the development."

(See note)\n\nOn July 31, 2025, El Salvador\u2019s Legislative Assembly passed a constitutional\nreform to officially withdraw from the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN).\nThe move reflects a shift in the country\u2019s foreign and regional strategy,\nciting PARLACEN\u2019s limited legal authority and the desire to reduce public\nspending. This marks a clear departure from previous approaches to regional\nintegration. As a result, El Salvador will stop electing representatives to\nthe body starting with the 2027 legislative elections."

The court said there is no\nmechanism to withdraw from the PARLACEN and Panama could not opt out. In\nJanuary 2012, the Panamanian Supreme Court re-affirmed that ruling and Panama\nreturned to PARLACEN.

The killers were arrested three days\nlater and detained in a Guatemalan prison, where they were themselves murdered\nseveral days later by a group of gunmen disguised as prison guards. Guatemalan\npresident \u00d3scar Berger attributed the officers' murders to an apparent mafia\nhit aimed at hindering investigation into the representatives' murders. The\nkillings raised questions regarding corruption and drug trafficking in Central\nAmerica as well as the high level of infiltration of the Guatemalan national\npolice force by organized crime."
