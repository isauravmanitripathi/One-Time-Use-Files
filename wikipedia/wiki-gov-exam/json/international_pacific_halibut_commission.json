It\nwas founded by an international treaty concluded on March 2, 1923. The\noriginal treaty has been revised three times (in 1953, 1976, and 1979). The\n1979 amendment clarified the role of the IPHC in the management of the fishery\nthrough the North Pacific Halibut Act of 1982.\n\nIt has carried out many activities including the use of chartered commercial\nfishing vessels to undertake bottom trawls and long-lining for sampling fish\nstocks, banding fish, recording water temperatures using bathythermographs,\netc., in the North Pacific and Bering Sea for many years. Also, staff have\nbeen stationed at on-shore fish processing plants to sample catches, remove\notoliths to determine the age of the fish, and many other research activities.\nThe commission holds a regularly Annual Meetings and occasionally Special\nMeetings as necessary.\n\nIts offices were located on the campus of the University of Washington until\nNovember 2010. The IPHC has since moved its offices to the Interbay\nneighborhood of Seattle."
