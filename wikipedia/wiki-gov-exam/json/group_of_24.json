Though originally named after\nthe number of founding Member States, it now has 28 Members (plus China, which\nacts as a _Special Invitee_). Although the G-24 officially has 28 member\ncountries, any member of the G-77 can join discussions.\n\nAlthough the group is not an organ of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF\nprovides secretariat services for the Group. It meets biannually, first prior\nto the International Monetary and Financial Committee, and secondly prior to\nthe Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and the\nFund. These meetings allow developing country members to discuss agenda items\nprior to these important meetings of the IMF/World Bank."
