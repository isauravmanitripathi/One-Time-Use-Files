It has 192 member states and is headquartered in Bern, Switzerland.\n\nEstablished in 1874 as the **General Postal Union** , the UPU is among the\noldest extant intergovernmental organizations. It sought to standardize\ninternational mail delivery by establishing a uniform postal rate and equal\ntreatment between domestic and foreign mail. The organization adopted its\ncurrent name in 1878. It operated independently before being incorporated into\nthe UN in 1948.\n\nThe UPU contains four bodies: the Congress, the Council of Administration\n(CA), the Postal Operations Council (POC) and the International Bureau (IB).\nIt also oversees the Telematics and Express Mail Service (EMS) cooperatives,\nwhich provide international express mail delivery. Pursuant to the UPU's\nmission, each member state agrees to the same terms for conducting\ninternational postal duties."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Before the establishment of the UPU, every pair of countries that exchanged\nmail had to negotiate a postal treaty with each other. In the absence of a\ntreaty providing for direct delivery of letters, mail had to be forwarded\nthrough an intermediate country. Postal arrangements were complex and\noverlapping. In 1853, the United States had a postal treaty with Prussia, but\nsome states in southern Germany were sending their US-bound mail through\nFrance instead. Since there was no postal treaty between the United States and\nFrance, the mail had to travel on a British or a Belgian ship. US Postmaster-\nGeneral James Campbell doubted \"whether ... the arrangement can be safely\ncontinued,\" but he saw hope in a postal treaty with Bremen that also covered\nthe Austro-German Postal Union.\n\nNegotiations for postal treaties could drag on for years. The United States\ndrafted a postal treaty with France in 1852, but the two countries disagreed\non how to divide the inland postage, and a treaty was not signed until 1857.\nHowever, the treaty was allowed to expire. Elihu Washburne, the new US\nMinister to France, arrived in Paris in 1869 to find \"the singular spectacle\n... of no postal arrangements between two countries connected by so many\nbusiness and social relations.\" The United States and France finally exchanged\nratifications of a postal treaty in July 1874, just three months before the\nUniversal Postal Union made the treaty unnecessary. An exasperated Washburne\ncomplained, \"There is no nation in the world more difficult to make treaties\nwith than France.\"\n\nThe UPU Monument _(Weltpostdenkmal)_ in Bern, bronze and granite, by Ren\u00e9 de\nSaint-Marceaux (1909), the five continents join to transmit messages around\nthe globe, later adopted (1967) as the organization's logo"

        "generated_section_content_md": "Heinrich von Stephan, German Postmaster-General and founder of the General\nPostal Union\n\nFaced with such difficulties in exchanging mail with Europe, the United States\nhad already taken the lead in calling for improvements to international mail\narrangements. United States Postmaster General Montgomery Blair called for an\nInternational Postal Congress in 1863. Meeting in Paris, the delegates laid\ndown some general principles for postal cooperation but failed to come to an\nagreement.\n\nThe German victory in the Franco-Prussian War cleared away the obstacles to a\npostal union. After defeating Napoleon III in 1870, the North German\nConfederation and the South German states united to form the German Empire.\nThe German Reichspost established a uniform set of postage rates and\nregulations for the new country, but the uniformity ended at the German\nborder. Different amounts of postage were required to mail a letter from\nBerlin to New York, depending on which ship carried the letter across the\nAtlantic Ocean. To bring order to the system of international mail, German\nPostmaster-General Heinrich von Stephan called for another International\nPostal Congress in 1874.\n\nMeeting in Bern, Switzerland, the delegates agreed to all of von Stephan's\nproposals. The Treaty of Bern was signed on 9 October 1874, establishing what\nwas then known as the _General Postal Union_.\n\nThe treaty provided that:\n\n1. There should be a uniform flat rate to mail a letter anywhere in the world\n2. Postal authorities should give equal treatment to foreign and domestic mail\n3. Each country should retain all money it has collected for international postage.\n\nOne important result of the Treaty was that it was no longer necessary to\naffix postage stamps of countries that a mailpiece passed through in transit.\nThe UPU provides that stamps from member nations are accepted along the entire\ninternational route."

At the second Postal Union Congress in 1878, it was\nrenamed the Universal Postal Union.\n\nFrench was the sole official language of the UPU until English was added as a\nworking language in 1994. The majority of the UPU's documents and\npublications\u2014including its flagship magazine, _Union Postale_ \u2014are available\nin the United Nations' six official languages: French, English, Arabic,\nChinese, Russian, and Spanish.\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the UPU issued rules concerning stamp\ndesign, intended to ensure maximum efficiency in handling international mail.\nOne rule specified that stamp values be given in numerals, as denominations\nwritten out in letters were not universally comprehensible. Another required\nmember nations to use the same colors on their stamps issued for post cards\n(green), normal letters (red) and international mail (blue), a system that\nremained in use for several decades.\n\n100 years of UPU commemorated on a US postage stamp\n\nAfter the foundation of the United Nations, the UPU became a specialized\nagency of the UN in 1948.

        "generated_section_content_md": "The 1874 treaty provided for the originating country to keep all of the\npostage revenue, without compensating the destination country for delivery.\nThe idea was that each letter would generate a reply, so the postal flows\nwould be in balance. However, other classes of mail had imbalanced flows. In\n1906, the Italian postal service was delivering 325,000 periodicals mailed\nfrom other countries to Italy, while Italian publishers were mailing no\nperiodicals to other countries. The system also encouraged countries to remail\nthrough another country, forcing the intermediate postal service to bear the\ncosts of transport to the final destination.\n\nRemailing was banned in 1924, but the UPU took no action on imbalanced flows\nuntil 1969. The problem of imbalanced flows became acute after decolonization,\nas dozens of former European colonies entered the UPU as independent states.\nThe developing countries received more mail than they sent, so they wanted to\nbe paid for delivery.\n\nIn 1969, the UPU introduced a system of terminal dues. When two countries had\nimbalanced mail flows, the country that sent more mail would have to pay a fee\nto the country that received more mail. The amount was based on the difference\nin the weight of mail sent and received. Since the Executive Council had been\nunable to come up with a cost-based compensation scheme after five years of\nstudy, terminal dues were set arbitrarily at half a gold franc (0.163 SDR) per\nkilogram. Also since 1969, it announces the annual best postal services on 9\nOctober, the World Post Day."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Once terminal dues had been established, they became a topic of discussion at\nevery future Postal Union Congress. The 1974 Congress tripled the terminal\ndues to 1.5 gold francs, and the 1979 Congress tripled them again to 4.5 gold\nfrancs. The 1984 Congress increased terminal dues by another 45%.\n\nThe system of terminal dues also created new winners and losers. Since the\nterminal dues were fixed, low-cost countries that were net recipients would\nturn a profit on delivering international mail. Developing countries were low-\ncost recipients, but so were developed countries like the United States and\nthe United Kingdom. Since the dues were payable based on weight, periodicals\nwould be assessed much higher terminal dues than letters.\n\nThe continuing fiscal imbalances required repeated changes to the system of\nterminal dues. In 1988 a per-item charge was included in terminal dues to\ndrive up the cost of remailing, an old scourge that had returned. To resolve\nthe problem with periodicals, the UPU adopted a \"threshold\" system in 1991\nthat set separate letter and periodical rates for countries which receive at\nleast 150 tonnes of mail annually. The 1999 Postal Congress established\n\"country-specific\" terminal dues for industrialized countries, offering a\nlower rate to developing countries."

That year, the United States Postal Service made a $275\nmillion surplus on international mail. In addition, the UPU system was only\navailable to state-run postal services. Low terminal dues gave the United\nStates Postal Service an advantage over private postal services such as DHL\nand FedEx. To protect its profits on sending international mail, the United\nStates voted with the developing countries to keep terminal dues low. They\nwere opposed by the German Post and the Norwegian Post, which wanted to\nincrease terminal dues.\n\nHowever, the low terminal dues backfired on the United States due to shifts in\nmail flows. With the growth of e-commerce, the United States began to import\nmore goods through the mail. In 2015, the United States Postal Service made a\nnet deficit on international mail for the first time. The deficits increased\nto $80 million in 2017. The UPU established a new remuneration system in 2016,\na move that the United States Department of State said would \"dramatically\nimprov[e] USPS's cost coverage for the delivery of ... packets from China and\nother developing countries.\" However, the Chairman of the Postal Regulatory\nCommission disagreed."

        "generated_section_content_md": "With the outbreak of the China\u2013United States trade war in 2018, the issue of\nterminal dues was pushed into the forefront. Americans complained that mailing\na package from China to the United States cost less than mailing the same\npackage within the United States. At the time, the UPU's Postal Development\nIndicator scale was used to classify countries into four groups from richest\nto poorest. The United States was a Group I country, while China was a Group\nIII country, alongside countries like Mexico and Turkey that had similar GDP\nper capita. As a result, China paid lower terminal dues than the United\nStates. The Presidency of Donald Trump complained that it was \"being forced to\nheavily subsidize small parcels coming into our country.\" On 17 October 2018,\nthe United States announced that it would withdraw from the UPU in one year\nand self-declare the rates it charged to other postal services.\n\nThe Universal Postal Union responded in May 2019 by calling, for only the\nthird time in its history, an Extraordinary Congress for 24\u201326 September 2019.\nThe members voted down a proposal submitted by the United States and Canada,\nwhich would have allowed immediate self-declaration of terminal dues. The UPU\nthen unanimously passed a Franco-German compromise to allow self-declared\nterminal dues of up to 70% of the domestic postage rate and increase the UPU\nterminal dues by 119\u2013164%, phasing in both changes from 2021 to 2025. In\naddition, countries receiving more than 75,000 tonnes of mail\u2014currently only\nthe United States\u2014could opt in to accelerated self-declared terminal dues on 1\nJuly 2020 in return for an $8 million annual \"contribution\" to the UPU for\nfive years. Trump adviser Peter Navarro declared that the agreement \"more than\nachieved the President's goal,\" but he denied that the United States was\n\"buying\" the deal with its \"contribution\".
