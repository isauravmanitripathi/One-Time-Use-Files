It is\nheadquartered at the UN Office in Vienna, Austria, with a permanent presence\nin over 60 countries. As of October 4,2024, UNIDO comprises 173 member states,\nwhich together set the organization's policies, programs, and principles\nthrough the biannual General Conference.\n\nUNIDO was established in 1966 by the UN General Assembly to promote and\naccelerate the industrialization of developing countries, which were emerging\nfrom decolonization in record numbers and with little to no industrial base.\nIn 1979 it became one of the 15 specialized agencies of the UN, with its new\nconstitution coming into force in 1985. Since its founding, the organization\nhas restructured and reformed several times; the 2013 Lima Declaration\nexpanded its mission to include promoting \"inclusive and sustainable\nindustrial development\" (ISID), defined as benefiting greater numbers of\npeople while safeguarding the environment. UNIDO is a member of the United\nNations Development Group, a coalition of UN entities aimed at fulfilling the\nSustainable Development Goals.\n\nOn 25 July 2016, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution\nA/RES/70/293, proclaiming the period 2016\u20132025 as the Third Industrial\nDevelopment Decade for Africa (IDDA III). UNIDO was called upon to lead the\ninitiative in collaboration with a range of partners. These include the\nAfrican Union Commission, the New Partnership for Africa's Development, the\nEconomic Commission for Africa, etc.\n\nFrom 2018 to 2021, UNIDO's strategic priorities include creating shared\nprosperity; advancing economic competitiveness; safeguarding the environment;\nand strengthening knowledge and institutions. Each of these goals is to be\nachieved through technical cooperation, policy advice, analysis and research,\nthe development of uniform standards and quality control, and partnerships for\nknowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation.\n\nUNIDO employs some 670 staff and draws on the services of some 2,800\ninternational and national experts\u2014approximately half from developing\ncountries\u2014annually, who work in project assignments throughout the world."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The relevance of ISID as an integrated approach to all three pillars of\nsustainable development is recognized by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable\nDevelopment and the related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which will\nframe United Nations and country efforts towards sustainable development in\nthe next fifteen years. UNIDO's mandate is fully recognized in SDG-9, which\ncalls to \"Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable\nindustrialization and foster innovation\". The relevance of ISID, however,\napplies in greater or lesser extent to all SDGs.\n\nAccordingly, the Organization's programmatic focus is structured, as detailed\nin the Organization's Medium-Term Programme Framework 2018\u20132021, in four\nstrategic priorities:\n\n* Creating shared prosperity;\n* Advancing economic competitiveness;\n* Safeguarding the environment;\n* Strengthening knowledge and institutions.\n\nEach of these programmatic fields of activity contains a number of individual\nprogrammes, which are implemented in a holistic manner to achieve effective\noutcomes and impacts through UNIDO's four enabling functions:\n\n* Technical cooperation;\n* Analytical and research functions and policy advisory services;\n* Normative functions and standards and quality-related activities;\n* Convening and partnerships for knowledge transfer, networking and industrial cooperation.\n\nIn carrying out the core requirements of its mission, UNIDO has considerably\nincreased its technical services over the past ten years. At the same time, it\nhas also substantially increased its mobilization of financial resources,\ntestifying to the growing international recognition of the Organization as an\neffective provider of catalytic industrial development services.\n\nUNIDO was established as a UN programme in 1966 with headquarters in Vienna,\nAustria, and became a specialized agency of the United Nations in 1985.\n\nIn 2004, UNIDO established the UNIDO Goodwill Ambassador programme.\n\nIn 2009, UNIDO created a new flagship publication, _Making It: Industry for\nDevelopment_ Archived 9 November 2020 at the Wayback Machine."

These studies culminated in a programme of work on\nindustrialization and productivity prepared by the United Nations Secretary-\nGeneral in 1956 and endorsed the next year by ECOSOC and the General Assembly.\nAt that time, it was first suggested that a special body to deal with the\nproblems of industrialization be established, whose political organs could\nrelieve ECOSOC and the General Assembly of the detailed consideration of those\nquestions and whose secretariat could carry out more substantive work than the\nexisting Industry Section of the Bureau of Economic Affairs within the\nSecretariat. The Industry Section of the Secretariat became a branch in 1959,\nand in 1962 it became the _Industrial Development Centre_ , headed by a\n_Commissioner for Industrial Development_."

In January 1967, the Organization was formally established\nwith headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Compared to the Industrial Development\nCentre, UNIDO's creation was intended to broaden the work of its predecessor.\nBesides normative activities, such as acting as a forum for discussions,\nanalytical functions and information dissemination, UNIDO became involved in\noperational activities, i.e. in technical co-operation activities."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The setting up of UNIDO as a special organ had nonetheless been a compromise\nsolution. The developing countries (the Group of 77) had in the first instance\npromoted the idea of a specialized agency with its own political decision-\nmaking governing bodies and autonomy in budgetary matters. The same position\nwas advocated by several high-level expert groups and intergovernmental\ncommittees during the following years. In the context of the General\nAssembly's adoption of the _Declaration and Programme of Action on the\nEstablishment of a New International Economic Order and of the Charter of\nEconomic Rights and Duties of States_ , UNIDO's second General Conference,\nheld in 1975 in Lima, Peru, adopted the _Lima Declaration on Industrial\nDevelopment and Cooperation_. For the first time, industrial development\nobjectives were quantified internationally \u2013 the Lima Target anticipated the\ndeveloping countries to attain a twenty-five per cent share of world\nindustrial production by the year of 2000. As part of the institutional\narrangements of the Lima Plan of Action, and with a view to assisting in the\nestablishment of a New International Economic Order, it was recommended to the\nGeneral Assembly that UNIDO be converted into a specialized agency.\n\nAn intergovernmental committee prepared a draft constitution, which was\nadopted in Vienna in 1979. However, the objections and doubts of\nindustrialized countries as to the necessity of a specialized agency\ncontributed to delaying the ratification process. In order to ensure that the\nnew organization would start up with a membership including substantially all\nsignificant States, the General Assembly, by resolutions adopted in 1982 and\n1984, called for a series of formal consultations among prospective Member\nStates, which eventually led to a general agreement that the new UNIDO\nConstitution should enter into force. All necessary formal requirements were\nfulfilled in 1985, and in December of the same year, UNIDO finally became the\nsixteenth Specialized Agency of the United Nations with headquarters in\nVienna."

        "generated_section_content_md": "During the subsequent years, UNIDO continuously expanded particularly its\noperational activities. However, several developments outside and inside the\nOrganization led to a crisis, which reached a breaking point in 1997 when\nUNIDO faced the risk of closure: After the end of the Cold War and the triumph\nof the market economic system over the command economic system, and in view of\nthe Washington Consensus that limited the role of industrial policy in\neconomic development processes, some Member States felt that industrial\ndevelopment could be supported more effectively and efficiently by the private\nsector. As a result, Canada, the United States (UNIDO's then largest donor),\nand Australia subsequently withdrew from the Organization between 1993 and\n1997. Simultaneously, the continued slowdown in the economies of some major\nindustrialized countries as well as the financial turmoil of the 1997 Asian\nfinancial crisis caused multilateral development assistance to decline. In\naddition, a weak management structure and lack of focus and integration of\nUNIDO's activities contributed to aggravating the crisis.\n\nUNIDO's Member States responded by adopting a stringent Business Plan on the\nFuture Role and Functions of the Organization in June 1997. Activities laid\nout in the Business Plan are based on the clear comparative advantages of\nUNIDO, while avoiding overlap and duplication with other multilateral\ninstitutions. A key point was that activities should be integrated into\npackages of services, rather than being provided on a stand-alone basis. The\nOrganization radically reformed itself on the basis of this business plan and\nstreamlined its services, human and financial resources as well as internal\nprocesses during the following years."
