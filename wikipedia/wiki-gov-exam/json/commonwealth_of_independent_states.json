It was formed following the\ndissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. It covers an area of 20,368,759 km2\n(7,864,422 sq mi) and has an estimated population of 246,200,194. The CIS\nencourages cooperation in economic, political, and military affairs and has\ncertain powers relating to the coordination of trade, finance, lawmaking, and\nsecurity, including cross-border crime prevention.\n\nAs the Soviet Union disintegrated, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine signed the\nBelovezha Accords on 8 December 1991, declaring that the Union had effectively\nceased to exist and proclaimed the CIS in its place. On 21 December, the Alma-\nAta Protocol was signed, but Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania chose not to\nparticipate. Georgia withdrew its membership in 2008 following a war with\nRussia. Ukraine formally ended its participation in CIS statutory bodies in\n2018, although it had stopped participating in the organization in 2014\nfollowing the Russian annexation of Crimea. Following the 2022 Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine, Moldova voiced its intention to progressively withdraw\nfrom the CIS institutional framework.\n\nEight of the nine CIS member states participate in the CIS Free Trade Area.\nThree organizations originated from the CIS, namely the Collective Security\nTreaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic Union (alongside subdivisions, the\nEurasian Customs Union and the Eurasian Economic Space); and the Union State.\nWhile the first and the second are military and economic alliances, the third\naims to reach a supranational union of Russia and Belarus with a common\ngovernment and currency."

Following the\nOctober Revolution, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic became\nthe leading republic in the Soviet Union (USSR) upon its creation with the\n1922 Treaty and Declaration of the Creation of the USSR along with\nByelorussian SSR, Ukrainian SSR and Transcaucasian SFSR.\n\nIn March 1991, amidst Perestroika and a rising political crisis in the\ncountry, Mikhail Gorbachev, the president of the Soviet Union, proposed a\nfederation by holding a referendum to preserve the Union as a union of\nsovereign republics. The new treaty signing never happened as the Communist\nParty hardliners staged an attempted coup in Moscow in August that year."

A week after the Ukrainian\nindependence referendum was held, which kept the chances of the Soviet Union\nstaying together low, the Commonwealth of Independent States was founded in\nits place on 8 December 1991 by the Byelorussian SSR, the Russian SFSR, and\nthe Ukrainian SSR, when the leaders of the three republics met at the\nBelovezhskaya Pushcha Natural Reserve, about 50 km (31 mi) north of Brest in\nBelarus, and signed the \"Agreement Establishing the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States\", known as the Belovezh Accords (Russian: \u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435\n\u0441\u043e\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, romanized:  _Belovezhskiye soglasheniya_).\n\nThe CIS announced that the new organization would be open to all republics of\nthe former Soviet Union and to other nations sharing the same goals. The CIS\ncharter stated that all the members were sovereign and independent nations and\nthereby effectively abolished the Soviet Union. On 21 December 1991, the\nleaders of eight additional former Soviet Republics (Armenia, Azerbaijan,\nKazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan)\nsigned the Alma-Ata Protocol which can either be interpreted as expanding the\nCIS to these states or the proper foundation or foundation date of the CIS,\nthus bringing the number of participating countries to 11. Georgia joined two\nyears later, in December 1993. At this point, 12 of the 15 former Soviet\nRepublics participated in the CIS, the three non-participants being the Baltic\nstates, which were occupied by the Soviet Union. The CIS and Soviet Union also\nlegally co-existed briefly with each other until 26 December 1991, when the\nSoviet of the Republics formally dissolved the Soviet Union. This was followed\nby Ivan Korotchenya becoming Executive Secretary of the CIS on the same day.\n\nAfter the end of the dissolution process of the Soviet Union, Russia and the\nCentral Asian republics were weakened economically and faced declines in GDP.\nPost-Soviet states underwent economic reforms and privatisation. The process\nof Eurasian integration began immediately after the break-up of the Soviet\nUnion to salvage economic ties with Post-Soviet republics."

To achieve this goal member states have agreed\nto promote and protect human rights. Initially, efforts to achieve this goal\nconsisted merely of statements of goodwill, but on 26 May 1995, the CIS\nadopted a Commonwealth of Independent States Convention on Human Rights and\nFundamental Freedoms.\n\nIn 1991, four years before the 1995 human rights treaty, article 33 of the\nCharter of the CIS created a Human Rights Commission with its seat in Minsk,\nBelarus. This was confirmed by the decision of the Council of Heads of States\nof the CIS in 1993. In 1995, the CIS adopted a human rights treaty that\nincludes civil and political as well as social and economic human rights. This\ntreaty entered into force in 1998. The CIS treaty is modelled on the European\nConvention on Human Rights, but lacking the strong implementation mechanisms\nof the latter. In the CIS treaty, the Human Rights Commission has very vaguely\ndefined authority. The Statute of the Human Rights Commission, however, also\nadopted by the CIS Member States as a decision, gives the commission the right\nto receive inter-state as well as individual communications.[_citation\nneeded_]\n\nCIS members, especially in Central Asia, continue to have among the world's\npoorest human rights records. Many activists point to examples such as the\n2005 Andijan massacre in Uzbekistan to show that there has been almost no\nimprovement in human rights since the collapse of the Soviet Union in Central\nAsia. The consolidation of power by President Vladimir Putin has resulted in a\nsteady decline in the modest progress of previous years in Russia. In turn,\nthis has led to little to no scrutiny by Russia when it comes to the situation\nof human rights in other CIS member states. The Commonwealth of Independent\nStates continues to face serious challenges in meeting even basic\ninternational standards."

The Common Economic Space would involve a supranational\ncommission on trade and tariffs that would be based in Kyiv, would initially\nbe headed by a representative of Kazakhstan, and would not be subordinate to\nthe governments of the four nations. The ultimate goal would be a regional\norganization that would be open for other countries to join as well, and could\neventually lead even to a single currency.[_citation needed_]\n\nOn 22 May 2003, the _Verkhovna Rada_ (the Ukrainian Parliament) voted 266\nvotes in favour and 51 against the joint economic space. However, most believe\nthat Viktor Yushchenko's victory in the Ukrainian presidential election of\n2004 was a significant blow against the project: Yushchenko had shown renewed\ninterest in Ukrainian membership in the European Union and such membership\nwould be incompatible with the envisioned common economic space.[_citation\nneeded_] Yushchenko's successor Viktor Yanukovych stated on 27 April 2010:\n\"Ukraine's entry into the Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan is\nnot possible today, since the economic principles and the laws of the WTO do\nnot allow it, we develop our policy following WTO principles\". Ukraine has\nbeen a WTO member since 2008.\n\nA Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia was thus created in 2010, A\nsingle market had been envisioned for 2012,[_citation needed_] but instead the\ncustoms union was renamed as the Eurasian Customs Union and expanded to\ninclude Armenia and Kyrgyzstan in 2015."

In this regard, Krotov agrees with Russian President Vladimir\nPutin's conclusion that \"Ukraine did not legally gain independence.\".\n\nAmerican geopolitician Zbigniew Brzezinski believed that \"it was Ukraine's\nactions... that prevented the CIS from becoming just a new name for a more\nfederal USSR.\""
