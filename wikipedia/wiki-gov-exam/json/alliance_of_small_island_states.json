        "generated_section_content_md": "Intergovernmental organization\n\n**Alliance of Small Island States** (**AOSIS**) is an intergovernmental\norganization of low-lying coastal and small island countries. AOSIS was\nestablished in 1990, ahead of the Second World Climate Conference. The main\npurpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of Small Island\nDeveloping States (SIDS) to address global warming.\n\nThese island countries are particularly vulnerable to climate change and its\nrelated effects on the ocean, including sea level rise, coastal erosion and\nsaltwater intrusion. The members are among the nations least responsible for\nclimate change, having contributed less than 1% to the world's greenhouse gas\nemissions. These states advocate for international policy and mechanisms for\naddressing the inequity of climate impacts."

        "generated_section_content_md": "AOSIS' core focus areas are climate change, sustainable development and ocean\nconservation.\n\nSIDS are among the nations least responsible for climate change, having\ncontributed less than 1% to the world's greenhouse gas emissions. They are\nparticularly vulnerable to its effects, with some islands at risk of becoming\nuninhabitable due to sea level rise. AOSIS has consistently raised this threat\nof uninhabitability created by climate change in climate negotiations.\n\nSIDS, of which AOSIS is predominantly comprised, account for less than 1% of\nthe global GDP, territory, and population, meaning that individually SIDS hold\nlittle political weight in international climate negotiations. The aim of\nAOSIS is to amplify the voices of its members by joining together states which\nface similar issues. This is to increase their ability to influence climate\nnegotiations and raise awareness for its concerns."

        "generated_section_content_md": "AOSIS has been very active from its inception. It has played a leading role in\nthe global arena in raising awareness on climate change and advocating for\naction to address climate change. The creation of the alliance marked the\nbeginning of the growth in influence of SIDS in climate politics. Despite\ntheir size and their relatively small economic and political weight, AOSIS\nmember states have pulled above their weight in climate change negotiations.\n\nAOSIS played an important role in establishing the United Nations Framework\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and was an important actor in the\nnegotiations of the Framework in 1992. Its advocacy was instrumental to the\ninclusion of references to the greater vulnerability and special needs of SIDS\nin Article 4.8 of the UNFCCC. However, AOSIS was unsuccessful in its attempts\nto persuade nations to include commitments to specified greenhouse gas\nemission reduction targets in the Framework.\n\nAOSIS continued to advocate for the special needs of SIDS during the Earth\nSummit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and the 'special case' of SIDS was recognised\nin Agenda 21, the political action plan which resulted from the Summit. AOSIS'\nproposal to create an 'international insurance fund', funded by developed\ncountries to compensate SIDS for damage caused by climate change, was turned\ndown. In Rio, AOSIS broadened its mandate beyond climate change to also\ninclude the sustainable development of SIDS. AOSIS negotiated for the\ninclusion of a small program area on the sustainable development of small\nislands in Agenda 21. Agenda 21 was not legally binding, and some academics\ncontend that the program was too vague to promote meaningful action.\n\nAOSIS did manage to secure the inclusion in Agenda 21 of a call for a global\nconference on this issue, which led to the first Global Conference on the\nSustainable Development of Small Island States, held in Barbados in 1994.\nAOSIS played a prominent role at the Conference. It was the first UN\nconference entirely devoted to SIDS. The Conference resulted in the\ntranslation of Agenda 21 into a more comprehensive programme, the Barbados\nProgramme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing\nStates. The five year review of the Barbados Conference, conducted at a\nspecial session of the UN General Assembly in 1999, found that the SIDS\nefforts to make progress towards sustainable development had been limited,\nwhile the ten year review of the Barbados Conference, which took the form of\nan international meeting in Mauritius in 2005, found that its implementation\nwas largely unsuccessful.\n\nAOSIS put forward the first draft text in the Kyoto Protocol negotiations as\nearly as 1994. AOSIS member states Fiji and Antigua and Barbuda were the first\nstates to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 1998.\n\nAOSIS has used formal and informal meetings scheduled in advance of UN climate\nchange conferences to raise awareness and political momentum for its mission.\nAOSIS has also used the media to raise awareness for its concerns. For\nexample, in the lead up to the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCCC) in\nCopenhagen, members of the cabinet of the Maldives, an AOSIS member state,\nheld an underwater cabinet meeting to create awareness of the threat that\nclimate change poses to the very existence of the Maldives. The stunt garnered\ninternational attention.\n\nAt the UN Climate Change Conference in Berlin in 1995, AOSIS advocated very\nstrongly for a commitment to timetables and target measures for climate\nchange. It gained the support of developed nations including China, Brazil,\nand India. AOSIS had advocated since 2008 for the inclusion of a temperature\ntarget to restrain global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Many\nof the AOSIS member states were present at the Conference in Copenhagen.\nDemocracy Now! reported that members from the island state of Tuvalu\ninterrupted a session of the Conference on 10 December 2009 to demand that\nglobal temperature rise be limited to 1.5 \u00b0C instead of the proposed 2 \u00b0C.\nThis advocacy continued in the lead up to the 2015 UNFCCC in Paris. AOSIS\ninitiated the negotiating agenda item which would lead to the inclusion of the\n1.5 \u00b0C target and was important in gaining support for its inclusion from\nvulnerable African and Asian countries and LDC countries. According to writer\nand activist Mark Lynas, the inclusion of the 1.5 \u00b0C target in the Paris\nAgreement was 'almost entirely' due to the advocacy of SIDS and other\ndeveloping countries.\n\nAt the 2013 Warsaw climate change conference, AOSIS pushed for the\nestablishment of an international mechanism on loss and damages stressed by\nthe wreckage of Supertyphoon Haiyan. As the existence of many AOSIS member\nstates are put at risk by climate change, AOSIS has threatened lawsuits. The\nresults of a recent review of the literature show that potential liability for\nclimate change-related losses for AOSIS is over $570 trillion. AOSIS raised\nthis issue again at the 2015 UNFCCC in Paris. AOSIS was instrumental in the\ninclusion of Article 8 in the Paris Agreement, which 'recognizes the\nimportance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage' caused by\nclimate change, although the article does not 'provide a basis for any\nliability of compensation'. As in previous climate agreements, AOSIS members\nwere among the first to ratify the Paris Agreement, with Fiji ratifying first,\nfollowed days later by the Republic of Marshall Islands, Palau, the Maldives,\nand others.\n\nAOSIS member state Fiji co-hosted the UN Oceans Conference in 2017. Ministers\nfrom AOSIS member states, including Fiji, Tuvalu, and Palau used this\nconference to again raise awareness of the real risk that the impact of\nclimate change poses to the very existence of their nations and to advocate\nfor action to address climate change. Fiji also presided over the 2017 UN\nClimate Change Conference, making it the first SIDS to preside over a UN\nconference on climate change, although the event took place in Bonn due to\nFiji's remote location, small size and limited infrastructure.\n\nAgreement was reached suddenly at the 2023 United Nations Climate Change\nConference (COP28) on the final day. Anna Rasmussen who was the chief\nnegotiator for AOSIS was shocked to find that the decision had been made while\nthe AOSIS delegation was not present."

        "generated_section_content_md": "AOSIS has a membership of 39 global states, of which 37 are members of the UN\nwhile 2 (Cook Islands and Niue) participate within UN agencies. The alliance\nrepresents 28% of the developing countries, and 20% of the UN's total\nmembership.\n\nAOSIS has a heterogeneous membership with member states spread across many\ndifferent global regions. While AOSIS' focus is on SIDS, its membership also\nincludes several low-lying coastal countries, for example Belize and Guyana,\nand larger islands, for example Papua New Guinea. Member nations also vary\neconomically, with AOSIS including both wealthy nations, such as Singapore, as\nwell as least developed countries (LDCs), such as Haiti. Some scholars contend\nthat AOSIS' heterogeneity has weakened its effectiveness, particularly in\nregard to its lobbying for sustainable development.\n\nThe common factor which unites AOSIS members is their particular vulnerability\nto climate change."
