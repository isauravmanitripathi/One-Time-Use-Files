Its mandate includes issues such as\narms control, the promotion of human rights, freedom of the press, and free\nand fair elections. It employs around 3,460 people, mostly in its field\noperations but also in its secretariat in Vienna, Austria, and its\ninstitutions. It has observer status at the United Nations.\n\nThe OSCE had its origins in 1975: its predecessors came together during the\nera of the Cold War to form a forum for discussion between the Western Bloc\nand the Eastern Bloc. Most of its 57 participating countries are in Europe,\nbut with some members in Asia or in North America. The participating countries\ncomprise much of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nThe OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, crisis\nmanagement, and post-conflict rehabilitation."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Helmut Schmidt, Erich Honecker, Gerald Ford and Bruno Kreisky at the 1975 CSCE\nsummit in Helsinki, Finland\n\nThe Organization has its roots in the 1975 Conference on Security and Co-\noperation in Europe (CSCE). Talks had been mooted about a European security\ngrouping since the 1950s but the Cold War prevented any substantial progress\nuntil the talks at Dipoli in Espoo began in November 1972. These talks were\nheld at the suggestion of the Soviet Union which wished to use the talks to\nmaintain its control over the communist states in Eastern Europe, and\nPresident of Finland Urho Kekkonen hosted them in order to bolster his policy\nof neutrality. Western Europe, however, saw these talks as a way to reduce the\ntension in the region, furthering economic cooperation and obtaining\nhumanitarian improvements for the populations of the communist bloc.\n\nThe recommendations of the talks, in the form of \"The Blue Book\", gave the\npractical foundations for a three-stage conference called the \"Helsinki\nprocess\". The CSCE opened in Helsinki on 3 July 1973 with 35 states sending\nrepresentatives. Stage I took only five days to agree to follow the Blue Book.\nStage II was the main working phase and was conducted in Geneva from 18\nSeptember 1973 until 21 July 1975.\n\nThe result of Stage II was the Helsinki Final Act. This was signed by the 35\nparticipating states during Stage III, which took place in Finlandia Hall\nbetween 30 July \u2013 1 August 1975. It was opened by the Holy See's diplomat\nCardinal Agostino Casaroli, who was the chairman of the conference.\n\nThe concepts of improving relations and implementing the act were developed\nover a series of follow-up meetings, with major gatherings in Belgrade (4\nOctober 1977 \u2013 8 March 1978), Madrid (11 November 1980 \u2013 9 September 1983) and\nVienna (4 November 1986 \u2013 19 January 1989).\n\nThe Copenhagen commitment was written \"to ensure that individuals are\npermitted to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of\nassociation, including the right to form, join and participate effectively in\nnon-governmental organizations, which seek the promotion and protection of\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\"\n\nThe Moscow Mechanism was agreed in 1991."

The process was capped by the renaming of the CSCE\nas the OSCE on 1 January 1995, in accordance with the results of a conference\nheld in Budapest in 1994. The OSCE now had a formal secretariat, a Senior\nCouncil, a Parliamentary Assembly, a Conflict Prevention Centre, and an Office\nfor Free Elections, which later became the Office for Democratic Institutions\nand Human Rights.\n\nIn December 1996, the \"Lisbon Declaration on a Common and Comprehensive\nSecurity Model for Europe for the Twenty-First Century\" affirmed the universal\nand indivisible nature of security on the European continent.\n\nIn Istanbul on 19 November 1999, the OSCE ended a two-day summit by calling\nfor a political settlement in Chechnya and adopting a Charter for European\nSecurity.\n\nThrough its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the\nOSCE observes and assesses elections in its member states, in order to support\nfair and transparent democratic processes, in keeping with the mutual\nstandards to which the organization is committed; between 1994 and 2004 the\nOSCE sent teams of observers to monitor more than 150 elections, typically\nfocusing on elections in emerging democracies. In 2004, at the invitation of\nthe United States Government, the ODIHR deployed an assessment mission, made\nup of participants from six OSCE member states, which observed that year's US\npresidential election and produced a report. It was the first time that a US\npresidential election was the subject of OSCE monitoring, although the\norganization had previously monitored state-level American elections in\nFlorida and California, in 2002 and 2003."

        "generated_section_content_md": "OSCE SMM monitoring the movement of heavy weaponry in eastern Ukraine\n\nOn 21 March 2014, the OSCE deployed its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine\nat the request of Ukraine's government. The mission has received mixed\nreviews. While some observers have applauded its function as the \"eyes and\nears of the international community\", others have accused the mission of bias\ntowards either Russia or Ukraine.\n\nOn 27 April 2014, the Girkin group that had taken control in the city of\nSloviansk took eight members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (OSCE SMM)\nas hostages. The group appointed Vyacheslav Ponomarev as mayor of the city.\n\nDuring the war in Donbas, an OSCE observer allowed Russian separatists to\ntravel in a vehicle with the organization's markings; this prompted\nallegations that the OSCE was biased in the war and not interested in carrying\nout its duties of mediating a ceasefire. The organization issued a statement\nregretting the incident.\n\nMoreover, the OSCE Observer Mission at Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk\n(which is organizationally separate from the Special Monitoring Mission) also\nreceived criticism alleging that only two checkpoints on the Russian\u2013Ukrainian\nborder are currently being monitored, which Daniel Baer, the US ambassador to\nthe OSCE at the time, described as \"seriously inadequate\".\n\nThe mission has been criticized for taking months to deploy drones to help\nmonitor borders as well as withdrawing them after only several weeks of use\ndue to Russian electronic attacks. Drones have been reintroduced to observe\nthe conflict in 2018.\n\nIn 2014, an advisor to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence wrongly claimed that\napproximately 80% of the OSCE observers located near Mariupol were Russian\ncitizens and that many had ties to Russian security agencies such as the FSB\nand the GRU. In reality, one observer out of 17 in Mariupol was a Russian\ncitizen. In total, the mission reports the number of Russian citizens in its\nranks as 39 out of 720, or 5,4%. The organization has also been accused of\nallegedly revealing the locations of Ukrainian troops to Russian forces during\nthe conflict.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, the mission was in the area to \"facilitate a local\nceasefire and monitor the repair works on a power station\", that it \"heard an\nexchange of artillery fire between unspecified parties\", and that \"artillery\nrounds were impacting at approximately 1km to the east of the SMM's position;\ntherefore the SMM left due to security concerns\". Furthermore, the report\nstates that the \"SMM team in the JCCC was in constant contact with the SMM\nteam in Staromikhailivka\". No mention of a wounded observer is made.\n\nOn 27 October 2015, a suspended OSCE monitor confirmed he had been a former\nemployee of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate. The suspended SMM stated\nthat he had no trouble receiving the position and neither the OSCE nor\nUkraine's Security Service thoroughly checked his background. Following the\nreport the OSCE issued a comment stating the monitor had been fired due to\nviolations of the organization's code of conduct.\n\nOn 6 April 2016, photos of OSCE monitors attending the wedding of a Russian\nseparatist emerged. The wedding had taken place in June 2015. The OSCE\nexpressed regret over the incident, issuing a statement saying \"The\nunprofessional behaviour displayed by the monitors in the picture is an\nindividual incident that should not be abused to cast a shadow on the\nreputation of other mission members.\" The OSCE reported that the monitors were\nno longer with the OSCE special monitoring mission.\n\nIn April 2017, an OSCE vehicle struck a mine, which killed one SMM member and\ninjured two. Two armoured vehicles were on patrol near Luhansk when one struck\nthe mine. The dead man was an American paramedic, while the injured included a\nwoman from Germany and a man from the Czech Republic.\n\nOn 18 July 2018, the German broadcaster ARD reported that Russian intelligence\nservices had received inside information about the activities of the OSCE\nSpecial Monitoring Mission to Ukraine from a staff member of the OSCE. The\ninsider information consisted of observers' preferences in alcohol and women,\ntheir financial situation, and their contacts in Ukraine. The OSCE issued a\nstatement expressing concern over the alleged security breach.\n\nRussia has accused members of the Mission of working for the Ukrainian SBU and\nof spying on the pro-Russian separatists. Furthermore, Russia has accused the\nmission of bias after it reported troop movements from separatist forces,\naccusing the mission of ignoring similar moves from Ukraine. Russia's foreign\nminister also has claimed that the mission failed to pay sufficient attention\nto human and minority rights within the Government-controlled areas of\nUkraine. Furthermore, he criticised that the mission did not clearly attribute\nceasefire violations to either side."

On 20 September, two\nUkrainian OSCE staffers were sentenced to 13 years of prison by a court in the\nLuhansk People's Republic for \"alleged high treason and espionage for the\nUnited States.\"\n\nIn March 2022, 45 participating States promoted, with the support of Ukraine,\nthe activation of the Moscow Mechanism for the establishment of an independent\nexpert mission on violations and abuses committed in the war of the Russian\nFederation, supported by Belarus, against Ukraine. The report of the Mission\nof Experts was presented to the OSCE Permanent Council on 13 April 2022 and\ndocumented clear patterns of violations of international humanitarian law by\nthe Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. OSCE/ODIHR continues to monitor the\nviolations of international humanitarian law and international human rights\nlaw in Ukraine.\n\nOn 2 June 2022, the same 45 participating States invoked again the Moscow\nMechanism to establish a new mission of experts to consider, follow up and\nbuild upon the findings of the Moscow Mechanism report published in April\n2022. The subsequent report, presented on 14 July 2022 to the OSCE Permanent\nCouncil, confirmed the outcomes of the previous mission and identified blatant\nviolations of international humanitarian law, mainly attributable to the\nRussian armed forces, as well as widespread violations of human rights,\nespecially in the territories under effective control of the Russian\nFederation.\n\nThe Russian delegation was not invited to the 29th OSCE Ministerial Council in\nDecember 2022 where the delegates considered the ramifications and regional\nsecurity challenges created by Russia's continued war against Ukraine. There\nwere calls to assess the reparations that Russia should be accountable for.\n\nSince the start of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has seized \u20ac2.7 million\nworth of armored vehicles that were previously part of the OSCE Special\nMonitoring Mission to Ukraine. According to a letter that was sent by Russian\nOSCE representatives to OSCE Secretary-General Helga Schmid in January 2023,\n71 trucks and cars were brought to the Luhansk People's Republic and the\nDonetsk People's Republic as \"evidence\" and criminal proceedings were\ninitiated against former OSCE personnel for espionage."

Rather than being a formal treaty ratified by national legislatures,\nthe Helsinki Final Act represents a political commitment by the heads of\ngovernment of all signatories to build security and cooperation in Europe on\nthe basis of its provisions. This allows the OSCE to remain a flexible\n_process_ for the evolution of improved cooperation, which avoids disputes\nand/or sanctions over implementation.\n\nBy agreeing to these commitments, signatories for the first time accepted that\nthe treatment of citizens _within_ their borders was also a matter of\nlegitimate international concern. This open process of the OSCE is often given\ncredit for helping build democracy in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,\nthus leading to the end of the Cold War.[_citation needed_] Unlike most\ninternational intergovernmental organizations, however, the OSCE does not have\ninternational legal personality on account of the lack of legal effect of its\ncharter. As a result, its headquarters' host, Austria, had to confer legal\npersonality on the organization in order to be able to sign a legal agreement\nregarding its presence in Vienna."

The last summit took place in Astana (Kazakhstan), on 1 and 2 December\n2010. The high-level decision-making body of the organization is the OSCE\nMinisterial Council, which meets at the end of every year. At the\nambassadorial level, the OSCE Permanent Council convenes weekly in Vienna and\nserves as the regular negotiating and decision-making body.

Representing the collective voice of OSCE parliamentarians, these\nresolutions and recommendations are meant to ensure that all participating\nstates live up to their OSCE commitments. The Parliamentary Assembly also\nengages in parliamentary diplomacy, and has an extensive election observation\nprogram.\n\nThe M\u0142odziejowski Palace in Warsaw, the seat of the ODIHR\n\nThe oldest OSCE institution is the Office for Democratic Institutions and\nHuman Rights (ODIHR), established in 1991 following a decision made at the\n1990 Summit of Paris. It is based in Warsaw, Poland, and is active throughout\nthe OSCE area in the fields of election observation, democratic development,\nhuman rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, rule of law, and Roma and\nSinti issues. The ODIHR has observed over 300 elections and referendums since\n1995, sending more than 50,000 observers. It has operated outside its own area\ntwice, sending a team that offered technical support to the 9 October 2004\npresidential elections in Afghanistan, an OSCE Partner for Co-operation, and\nan election support team to assist with parliamentary and provincial council\nelections on 18 September 2005. ODIHR is headed by Matteo Mecacci, Italy.\n\nThe Office of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, established in\nDecember 1997, acts as a watchdog to provide early warning on violations of\nfreedom of expression in OSCE participating States. The representative also\nassists participating States by advocating and promoting full compliance with\nOSCE norms, principles and commitments regarding freedom of expression and\nfree media. As of 2020, the current representative is Teresa Ribeiro,\nPortugal.\n\nThe High Commissioner on National Minorities was created on 8 July 1992 by the\nHelsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in\nEurope. It is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic\ntension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between\nparticipating states. As of 2020, the current representative is Kairat\nAbdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan).\n\nEach year the OSCE holds an OSCE Asian Conference with partner nations\n(currently Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Afghanistan).\n\nThe OSCE and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic established the OSCE\nAcademy in 2002. The aim of the OSCE Academy is \"to promote regional\ncooperation, conflict prevention and good governance in Central Asia through\noffering post-graduate education, professional training and intellectual\nexchange.\""

        "generated_section_content_md": "OSCE Chair-in-Office Ian Borg with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev in\nFebruary 2024\n\nThe OSCE takes a comprehensive approach to the politico-military dimension of\nsecurity, which includes a number of commitments by participating States and\nmechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. The organization also seeks\nto enhance military security by promoting greater openness, transparency and\nco-operation.\n\nArms control\n\nThe end of the Cold War resulted in a huge amount of surplus weapons becoming\navailable in what is known as the international grey market for weapons. The\nOSCE helps to stop the\u2014often illegal\u2014spread of such weapons and offers\nassistance with their destruction. The OSCE hosts the annual exchange of\ninformation under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. The OSCE has also\nimplemented two additional exchanges of information, the Vienna Document and\nthe Global Exchange of Military Information. The Open Skies Consultative\nCommission, the implementing body for the Treaty on Open Skies, meets monthly\nat its Vienna headquarters.\n\nBorder management\n\nThe actions taken by the OSCE in border monitoring range from conflict\nprevention to post-conflict management, capacity building and institutional\nsupport.\n\nCombating terrorism\n\nWith its expertise in conflict prevention, crisis management and early\nwarning, the OSCE contributes to worldwide efforts in combating terrorism.\n\nConflict prevention\n\nThe OSCE works to prevent conflicts from arising and to facilitate lasting\ncomprehensive political settlements for existing conflicts. It also helps with\nthe process of rehabilitation in post-conflict areas.\n\nMilitary reform\n\nThe OSCE's Forum for Security Co-operation provides a framework for political\ndialogue on military reform, while practical activities are conducted by field\noperations, as well as the Conflict Prevention Centre.\n\nPolicing\n\nOSCE police operations are an integral part of the organization's efforts in\nconflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.\n\nImplementation\n\nThe OSCE was a rather small organization until selection by the international\ncommunity to provide electoral organization to post war Bosnia and Herzegovina\nin early 1996. Ambassador Frowick was the first OSCE representative to\ninitiate national election in September 1996, human rights issues and rule of\nlaw specifically designed to provide a foundation for judicial organization\nwithin Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nThe OSCE had regional offices and field offices, to include the office in\nBrcko in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina which remained in limbo until the\nBrcko Arbitration Agreement could be decided, finalized and implemented.\n\nBrcko become a \"special district\" and remains so today.\n\nThe OSCE essentially took the place of the United Nations in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina in part because the Bosnian leadership felt deep contempt for the\nUN efforts to stop the war which began in 1991 and ended in 1995. During the\ntime the United Nations were attempting a political solution, thousands of UN\ntroops were posted in and around Bosnia and Herzegovina with special emphasis\non Sarajevo. From 1991 to 1995, over 200,000 Bosnians were killed and over one\nmillion displaced and another million as refugees.\n\nThe OSCE continues to have a presence and a number of initiatives to bring a\nsustained peace to the region."

Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, a judge in the\nCriminal Court of Rome, took Office as the Special Representative in March\n2010. From 2006 to 2009, this Office was held by Eva Biaudet, a former Finnish\nMinister of Health and Social Services. Biaudet currently serves as Finnish\nOmbudsman for Minorities. Her predecessor was former Austrian Minister Helga\nKonrad, who served as the first OSCE Special Representative for Combating\nTrafficking in Human Beings.\n\nThe activities around Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region\nof the Office of the Special Representative include:\n\n* Co-operation with governments, helping them to accept and act on their responsibilities for curbing trafficking in human beings;\n* Providing governments with decision and policy-making aids and offering guidance on anti-trafficking management, with the aim of arriving at solutions tailored to the needs of the individual countries and in line with international standards;\n* Assisting governments to develop the national anti-trafficking structures required for efficient internal and transnational co-operation;\n* Raising awareness to draw attention to the complexity of the problem and to the need for comprehensive solutions;\n* Considering all dimensions of human trafficking, namely trafficking for sexual exploitation, trafficking for forced and bonded labour, including domestic servitude, trafficking into forced marriages, trafficking in organs and trafficking in children;\n* Ensuring the effective interaction of all agents and stake holders involved in the fight against human trafficking, ranging from governmental authorities, law enforcement officials to NGOs, and\u2014last but not least\u2014international organizations, as the agencies providing support thorough expertise and know-how;\n* Guaranteeing the highest possible visibility of the OSCE's fight against human trafficking to focus attention on the issue.\n\nDemocratization\n\nThe OSCE claims to promote democracy and assist the participating states in\nbuilding democratic institutions.\n\nEducation\n\nEducation programmes are an integral part of the organization's efforts in\nconflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.\n\nElections\n\nAs part of its democratization activities, the OSCE carries out election\nassistance projects in the run-up to, during, and following elections.\nHowever, the effectiveness of such assistance is arguable\u2014Kazakhstan, for\nexample, despite being the former chair of the OSCE, is considered by many to\nbe one of the least democratic countries in the world. Moreover, the recent\ndemocratic advances made in other Central Asian republics, notably Kyrgyzstan,\nhave led to rumours of Soviet-style disruption of the Kyrgyz democratic\nprocess by, in particular, Kazakhstan and Russia. This may be in large part\ndue to fears over the long-term stability of these countries' own quasi-\ndictatorships.\n\nGender equality\n\nThe equality of men and women is an integral part of sustainable democracy.\nThe OSCE aims to provide equal opportunities for men and women and to\nintegrate gender equality in policies and practices.\n\nHuman rights\n\nThe OSCE's human rights activities focus on such priorities as freedom of\nmovement and religion, preventing torture and trafficking in persons.\n\nNational and international NGOs\n\nOSCE could grant consultive status to NGOs and INGOs in the form of\n\"Researcher-in-residence programme\" (run by the Prague Office of the OSCE\nSecretariat): accredited representatives of national and international NGOs\nare granted access to all records and to numerous topical compilations related\nto OSCE field activities.\n\nMedia freedom\n\nThe OSCE observes relevant media developments in its participating states with\na view to addressing and providing early warning on violations of freedom of\nexpression.\n\nMinority rights\n\nEthnic conflict is one of the main sources of large-scale violence in Europe\ntoday. The OSCE's approach is to identify and to seek early resolution of\nethnic tensions, and to set standards for the rights of persons belonging to\nminority groups and High Commissioner on National Minorities has been\nestablished."
