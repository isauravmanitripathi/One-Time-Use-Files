        "generated_section_content_md": "Political association which developed from the British Empire\n\nThe **Commonwealth of Nations** , often referred to as the **British\nCommonwealth** or simply **the Commonwealth** , is an international\nassociation of 56 member states, the vast majority of which are former\nterritories of the British Empire from which it developed. They are connected\nthrough their use of the English language and cultural and historical ties.\nThe chief institutions of the association are the Commonwealth Secretariat,\nwhich focuses on intergovernmental relations, and the Commonwealth Foundation,\nwhich focuses on non-governmental relations between member nations. Numerous\norganisations are associated with and operate within the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Commonwealth dates back to the first half of the 20th century with the\ndecolonisation of the British Empire through increased self-governance of its\nterritories. It was created as the **British Commonwealth of Nations** through\nthe Balfour Declaration at the 1926 Imperial Conference, and formalised by the\nUnited Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster in 1931. In 1949, the London\nDeclaration allowed India to remain in the Commonwealth as a republic, marking\na significant evolution of the association.\n\nThe Head of the Commonwealth is Charles III. He is king of 15 member states,\nknown as the Commonwealth realms, while 36 other members are republics, and\nfive others have different monarchs. Although he became head upon the death of\nhis mother, Elizabeth II, the position is not technically hereditary.\n\nCommonwealth citizens enjoy benefits in some member countries, particularly in\nthe United Kingdom, and Commonwealth countries are represented to one another\nby high commissions rather than embassies. Member states have no legal\nobligations to one another, though various economic, judicial and military\narrangements exist between countries. The Commonwealth Charter defines their\nshared values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as promoted by\nthe quadrennial Commonwealth Games.\n\nA majority of Commonwealth countries are small states, with small island\ndeveloping states constituting almost half its membership."

She declared: \"So, it\nalso marks the beginning of that free association of independent states which\nis now known as the Commonwealth of Nations.\" As long ago as 18 January 1884\nLord Rosebery, while visiting Adelaide, South Australia, had described the\nchanging British Empire, as some of its colonies became more independent, as a\n\"Commonwealth of Nations\". Conferences of British and colonial prime ministers\noccurred periodically from the first one in 1887, leading to the creation of\nthe Imperial Conferences in 1911.\n\nThe Commonwealth developed from the imperial conferences. A specific proposal\nwas presented by Jan Smuts in 1917 when he coined the term \"the British\nCommonwealth of Nations\" and envisioned the \"future constitutional relations\nand readjustments in essence\" at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, attended\nby delegates from the Dominions as well as the United Kingdom. The term first\nreceived imperial statutory recognition in the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921,\nwhen the term _British Commonwealth of Nations_ was substituted for _British\nEmpire_ in the wording of the oath taken by members of parliament of the Irish\nFree State."

Newfoundland never did as due to economic\nhardship and the need for financial assistance from London, Newfoundland\nvoluntarily accepted the suspension of self-government in 1934 and governance\nreverted to direct control from London. Newfoundland later joined Canada as\nits tenth province in 1949.

        "generated_section_content_md": "After the Second World War ended, the British Empire was gradually dismantled.\nMost of its components have become independent countries, whether Commonwealth\nrealms or republics, and members of the Commonwealth. There remain the 14\nmainly self-governing British overseas territories which retain some political\nassociation with the United Kingdom. In April 1949, following the London\nDeclaration, the word \"British\" was dropped from the title of the Commonwealth\nto reflect its changing nature.\n\nBurma (Myanmar since 1989) and Aden (now part of Yemen) are the only states\nthat were British colonies at the time of the war not to have joined the\nCommonwealth upon independence. Former British protectorates and mandates that\ndid not become members of the Commonwealth are Egypt (independent in 1922),\nIraq (1932), Transjordan (1946), Palestine (part of which became the State of\nIsrael in 1948), Sudan (1956), British Somaliland (which united with the\nformer Italian Somaliland in 1960 to form the Somali Republic), Kuwait (1961),\nBahrain (1971), Oman (1971), Qatar (1971) and the United Arab Emirates (1971).\n\nThe post-war Commonwealth was given a fresh mission by Queen Elizabeth II in\nher Christmas Day 1953 broadcast, in which she envisioned the Commonwealth as\n\"an entirely new conception \u2013 built on the highest qualities of the Spirit of\nMan: friendship, loyalty, and the desire for freedom and peace\". However, the\nBritish treasury was so weak that it could not operate independently of the\nUnited States. Furthermore, the loss of defence and financial roles undermined\nJoseph Chamberlain's early 20th-century vision of a world empire that could\ncombine Imperial Preference, mutual defence and social growth. In addition,\nthe United Kingdom's cosmopolitan role in world affairs became increasingly\nlimited, especially with the losses of India and Singapore. While British\npoliticians at first hoped that the Commonwealth would preserve and project\nBritish influence, they gradually lost their enthusiasm, argues Krishnan\nSrinivasan. Early enthusiasm waned as British policies came under fire at\nCommonwealth meetings. Public opinion became troubled as immigration from non-\nwhite member states became large-scale (see also: Commonwealth diaspora).\n\nThe term \"New Commonwealth\" gained usage in the UK (especially in the 1960s\nand 1970s) to refer to recently decolonised countries, predominantly non-white\nand developing countries. It was often used in debates regarding immigration\nfrom these countries. The United Kingdom and the pre-1945 dominions became\ninformally known as the \"Old Commonwealth\", or more pointedly as the \"white\nCommonwealth\", in reference to what had been known as the \"White Dominions\"."

While Ireland had not actively participated in the Commonwealth\nsince the early 1930s, other dominions wished to become republics without\nlosing Commonwealth ties. The issue came to a head in April 1949 at a\nCommonwealth prime ministers' meeting in London. Under the London Declaration,\nas drafted by V. K. Krishna Menon, India agreed, when it became a republic in\nJanuary 1950, it would remain in the Commonwealth and accept the British\nSovereign as a \"symbol of the free association of its independent member\nnations and as such the Head of the Commonwealth\". Upon hearing this, King\nGeorge VI told Menon: \"So, I've become 'as such'.\" Some other Commonwealth\ncountries that have since become republics have chosen to leave, while others,\nsuch as Guyana, Mauritius and Dominica, have remained members.\n\nIndia's inaugural prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru declared on 16 May 1949,\nshortly following the Declaration, during the Constituent Assembly Debates\nthat:\n\n> We join the Commonwealth obviously because we think it is beneficial to us\n> and to certain causes in the world that we wish to advance. The other\n> countries of the Commonwealth want us to remain there because they think it\n> is beneficial to them. It is mutually understood that it is to the advantage\n> of the nations in the Commonwealth and therefore they join. At the same\n> time, it is made perfectly clear that each country is completely free to go\n> its own way; it may be that they may go, sometimes go so far as to break\n> away from the Commonwealth...Otherwise, apart from breaking the evil parts\n> of the association, it is better to keep a co-operative association going\n> which may do good in this world rather than break it.\n\nThe London Declaration is often seen as marking the beginning of the modern\nCommonwealth. Following India's precedent, other nations became republics, or\nconstitutional monarchies with their own monarchs. While some countries\nretained the same monarch as the United Kingdom, their monarchies developed\ndifferently and soon became (or had already become) essentially independent of\nthe British monarchy. The monarch is regarded as a separate legal personality\nin each realm, even though the same person is monarch of each realm."

British trade with the Commonwealth was four times larger than its\ntrade with Europe. In 1956 and 1957, the British government, under Prime\nMinister Anthony Eden, considered a \"Plan G\" to create a European free trade\nzone while also protecting the favoured status of the Commonwealth.\n\nAt the time of the Suez Crisis in 1956, and in the face of colonial unrest and\ninternational tensions, French prime minister Guy Mollet proposed to British\nprime minister Anthony Eden that their two countries be joined in a \"union\".\nWhen that proposal was turned down, Mollet suggested that France join the\nCommonwealth, possibly with \"a common citizenship arrangement on the Irish\nbasis\". These ideas faded away with the end of the Suez Crisis."

The country sought closer ties with the\nAnglophone world. Gabon was partially suspended from the Commonwealth in\nSeptember 2023 following a military coup, with two years given by the\nCommonwealth Ministerial Action Group for the country to hold new elections\nbefore a full suspension of Commonwealth membership would be considered. In\n2024 alone, trade between Togo and Britain increased by 94 percent; the\ncountry also sought to expand trade with India.

In 2025, during Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\nCommonwealth countries Australia, Canada, Cyprus and New Zealand aligned\nthemselves with the \"coalition of the willing\" spearheaded by British prime\nminister Keir Starmer to provide support for Ukraine. During the 2025 Liberal\nParty leadership contest in Canada, in light of aggressive actions taken by\nthe United States, the ultimate victor Mark Carney expressed support for\ndeepening relations with Britain, Australia and New Zealand.

        "generated_section_content_md": "The criteria for membership of the Commonwealth of Nations have developed over\ntime from a series of separate documents. The Statute of Westminster 1931, as\na fundamental founding document of the organisation, laid out that membership\nrequired dominionhood. The 1949 London Declaration ended this, allowing\nrepublican and indigenous monarchic members on the condition that they\nrecognised King George VI as \"Head of the Commonwealth\". In the wake of the\nwave of decolonisation in the 1960s, these constitutional principles were\naugmented by political, economic, and social principles. The first of these\nwas set out in 1961, when it was decided that respect for racial equality\nwould be a requirement for membership, leading directly to the withdrawal of\nSouth Africa's re-application (which they were required to make under the\nformula of the London Declaration upon becoming a republic). The 14 points of\nthe 1971 Singapore Declaration dedicated all members to the principles of\nworld peace, liberty, human rights, equality, and free trade.\n\nThese criteria were unenforceable for two decades, until, in 1991, the Harare\nDeclaration was issued, dedicating the leaders to applying the Singapore\nprinciples to the completion of decolonisation, the end of the Cold War, and\nthe end of apartheid in South Africa. The mechanisms by which these principles\nwould be applied were created, and the manner clarified, by the 1995 Millbrook\nCommonwealth Action Programme, which created the Commonwealth Ministerial\nAction Group (CMAG), which has the power to rule on whether members meet the\nrequirements for membership under the Harare Declaration. Also in 1995, an\nInter-Governmental Group was created to finalise and codify the full\nrequirements for membership. Upon reporting in 1997, as adopted under the\nEdinburgh Declaration, the Inter-Governmental Group ruled that any future\nmembers would \"as a rule\" have to have a direct constitutional link with an\nexisting member.\n\nIn addition to this new rule, the former rules were consolidated into a single\ndocument. These requirements are that members must accept and comply with the\nHarare principles, be fully sovereign states, recognise King Charles III as\nhead of the Commonwealth, accept the English language as the means of\nCommonwealth communication, and respect the wishes of the general population\nwith regard to Commonwealth membership. These requirements had undergone\nreview, and a report on potential amendments was presented by the Committee on\nCommonwealth Membership at the 2007 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\nNew members were not admitted at this meeting, though applications for\nadmission were considered at the 2009 CHOGM.\n\nNew members must \"as a general rule\" have a direct constitutional link to an\nexisting member. In most cases, this is due to being a former colony of the\nUnited Kingdom, but some have links to other countries, either exclusively or\nmore directly (e.g., Bangladesh to Pakistan, Samoa to New Zealand, Papua New\nGuinea to Australia, and Singapore to Malaysia). Mozambique, in 1995, was the\nfirst country to join without such a constitutional connection, leading to the\nEdinburgh Declaration and the current membership guidelines.\n\nIn 2009, Rwanda, formerly under Belgian and German rule, joined. Consideration\nfor Rwanda's admission was considered an \"exceptional circumstance\" by the\nCommonwealth Secretariat. Rwanda was permitted to join despite the\nCommonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI) finding that \"the state of\ngovernance and human rights in Rwanda does not satisfy Commonwealth\nstandards\", and that it \"does not therefore qualify for admission\". CHRI\ncommented that: \"It does not make sense to admit a state that already does not\nsatisfy Commonwealth standards. This would tarnish the reputation of the\nCommonwealth and confirm the opinion of many people and civic organisations\nthat the leaders of its governments do not really care for democracy and human\nrights, and that its periodic, solemn declarations are merely hot air.\"\n\nIn 2022, the former French territories of Togo and Gabon joined the\nCommonwealth."

A senior Commonwealth source stated in 2006 that \"many people\nhave assumed an interest from Israel, but there has been no formal approach\".\nIsrael and Palestine are both potential candidates for membership.\n\nPresident Yahya Jammeh unilaterally withdrew the Gambia from the Commonwealth\nin October 2013. However, newly elected president Adama Barrow returned the\ncountry to the organisation in February 2018.\n\nOther eligible applicants could be any of the remaining inhabited British\nOverseas Territories, Crown Dependencies, Australian external territories and\nthe Associated States of New Zealand if they become fully independent. Many\nsuch jurisdictions are already directly represented within the Commonwealth,\nparticularly through the Commonwealth Family. There are also former British\npossessions that have not become independent. Although Hong Kong has become\npart of China, it continues to participate in some of the institutions within\nthe Commonwealth Family, including the Commonwealth Lawyers Association, the\nCommonwealth Parliamentary Association, the Association of Commonwealth\nUniversities, the Commonwealth Association of Legislative Counsel and the\nCommonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC).\n\nAll three of the Crown dependencies regard their existing situation as\nunsatisfactory and have lobbied for change. In 2012, the States of Jersey\ncalled on the UK foreign secretary to request that the Commonwealth heads of\ngovernment \"consider granting associate membership to Jersey and the other\nCrown Dependencies as well as any other territories at a similarly advanced\nstage of autonomy\". Jersey proposed that it be accorded \"self-representation\nin all Commonwealth meetings; full participation in debates and procedures,\nwith a right to speak where relevant and the opportunity to enter into\ndiscussions with those who are full members; and no right to vote in the\nMinisterial or Heads of Government meetings, which is reserved for full\nmembers\". The States of Guernsey and the Government of the Isle of Man made\ncalls of a similar nature in the same year for a more integrated relationship\nwith the Commonwealth, including more direct representation and enhanced\nparticipation in Commonwealth organisations and meetings, including\nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meetings. The Chief Minister of the Isle of\nMan said that a \"closer connection with the Commonwealth itself would be a\nwelcome further development of the Island's international relationships\"."

Suspensions are\nagreed by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG), which meets\nregularly to address potential breaches of the Harare Declaration. Suspended\nmembers are not represented at meetings of Commonwealth leaders and ministers,\nalthough they remain members of the organisation.\n\nZimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth during the presidency of Robert\nMugabe (pictured), subsequently withdrawing. The country applied to rejoin\nfollowing Mugabe's removal from power.\n\nNigeria was suspended between 11 November 1995 and 29 May 1999, following its\nexecution of Ken Saro-Wiwa on the eve of the 1995 CHOGM. Pakistan was the\nsecond country to be suspended, on 18 October 1999, following the military\ncoup by Pervez Musharraf. The Commonwealth's longest suspension came to an end\non 22 May 2004, when Pakistan's suspension was lifted following the\nrestoration of the country's constitution. Pakistan was suspended for a second\ntime, far more briefly, for six months from 22 November 2007, when Musharraf\ncalled a state of emergency. Zimbabwe was suspended in 2002 over concerns\nregarding the electoral and land reform policies of Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF\ngovernment, before it withdrew from the organisation in 2003. On 15 May 2018,\nZimbabwe applied to rejoin the Commonwealth.\n\nThe declaration of a Republic in Fiji in 1987, after military coups designed\nto deny Indo-Fijians political power, was not accompanied by an application to\nremain. Commonwealth membership was held to have lapsed until 1997, after\ndiscriminatory provisions in the republican constitution were repealed and\nreapplication for membership made. Fiji has since been suspended twice, with\nthe first imposed from 6 June 2000 to 20 December 2001 after another coup.\nFiji was suspended yet again in December 2006, following the most recent coup.\nAt first, the suspension applied only to membership on the Councils of the\nCommonwealth. After failing to meet a Commonwealth deadline for setting a date\nfor national elections by 2010, Fiji was \"fully suspended\" on 1 September\n2009. The secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Kamalesh Sharma, confirmed\nthat full suspension meant that Fiji would be excluded from Commonwealth\nmeetings, sporting events and the technical assistance programme (with an\nexception for assistance in re-establishing democracy). Sharma stated that\nFiji would remain a member of the Commonwealth during its suspension, but\nwould be excluded from emblematic representation by the secretariat. On 19\nMarch 2014 Fiji's full suspension was amended to a suspension from councils of\nthe Commonwealth by the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, permitting Fiji\nto join a number of Commonwealth activities, including the Commonwealth Games.\nFiji's suspension was lifted in September 2014. The Commonwealth Ministerial\nAction Group fully reinstated Fiji as a member following elections in\nSeptember 2014.\n\nMost recently, during 2013 and 2014, international pressure mounted to suspend\nSri Lanka from the Commonwealth, citing grave human rights violations by the\ngovernment of President Mahinda Rajapaksa. There were also calls to change the\nCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2013 from Sri Lanka to another member\ncountry. Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper threatened to boycott the\nevent, but was instead represented at the meeting by Deepak Obhrai. UK prime\nminister David Cameron also chose to attend. These concerns were rendered moot\nby the election of opposition leader Maithripala Sirisena as president in\n2015."

The first state to do so was Ireland in 1949\nfollowing its decision to declare itself a republic, although it had not\nparticipated in the Commonwealth since 1932. At the time, all members accepted\nthe British monarch as head of state as a condition of membership. This rule\nwas changed after Ireland's departure to allow India to retain membership when\nit became a republic in 1950, although Ireland did not rejoin. Now, the\nmajority of the Commonwealth members, including all those from Africa, are\nrepublics or have their own native monarch.\n\nPakistan left on 30 January 1972 in protest at the Commonwealth's recognition\nof breakaway Bangladesh, but rejoined on 2 August 1989. Zimbabwe's membership\nwas suspended in 2002 on the grounds of alleged human rights violations and\ndeliberate misgovernment, and Zimbabwe's government terminated its membership\nin 2003. The Gambia left the Commonwealth on 3 October 2013, and rejoined on 8\nFebruary 2018.\n\nThe Maldives withdrew from the Commonwealth on 13 October 2016, citing the\nCommonwealth's \"punitive actions against the Maldives since 2012\" after the\nallegedly forced resignation of Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed among the\nreasons for withdrawal. Following the election of Ibrahim Mohamed Solih as\npresident in November 2018, the Maldives announced its intention to reapply to\njoin the Commonwealth. It rejoined on 1 February 2020.\n\nHaving left the Commonwealth over its apartheid policies, South Africa was\nreadmitted in 1994 following non-racial elections.\n\nNo country has been formally expelled from the Commonwealth. However, South\nAfrica's application to remain a member of the organisation after becoming a\nrepublic in 1961 was effectively blocked due to hostility from many members,\nparticularly those in Africa and Asia as well as Canada, to apartheid. The\nSouth African government withdrew its application when it became clear at the\n1961 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference that it would be rejected. South\nAfrica was re-admitted to the Commonwealth in 1994, following its first\nmultiracial elections that year. The Commonwealth provided technical\nassistance and training for a peacekeeping force prior to election, with\nCommonwealth observers significantly present during the election itself.\n\nThe transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997 ended the territory's\nstatus as a part of the Commonwealth through the United Kingdom. Non-sovereign\nstates or regions are not permitted to become members of the Commonwealth. The\ngovernment of China has not pursued membership. Hong Kong has nevertheless\ncontinued to participate in some of the organisations of the Commonwealth\nFamily, such as the Commonwealth Lawyers Association (hosted the Commonwealth\nLawyers Conference in 1983 and 2009), the Commonwealth Parliamentary\nAssociation (and the Westminster Seminar on Parliamentary Practice and\nProcedures), the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the Commonwealth\nAssociation of Legislative Counsel, as well as the Commonwealth War Graves\nCommission (CWGC)."

To these were added opposition to\ndiscrimination on the basis of gender by the Lusaka Declaration of 1979, and\nenvironmental sustainability by the Langkawi Declaration of 1989.

The panel made 106 \"urgent\" recommendations including the\nadoption of a Charter of the Commonwealth, the creation of a new commissioner\non the rule of law, democracy and human rights to track persistent human\nrights abuses and allegations of political repression by Commonwealth member\nstates, recommendations for the repeal of laws against homosexuality in 41\nCommonwealth states and a ban on forced marriage. The failure to release the\nreport, or accept its recommendations for reforms in the area of human rights,\ndemocracy and the rule of law, was described as a \"disgrace\" by former British\nforeign secretary Malcolm Rifkind, a member of the EPG, who told a press\nconference: \"The Commonwealth faces a very significant problem. It's not a\nproblem of hostility or antagonism, it's more of a problem of indifference.\nIts purpose is being questioned, its relevance is being questioned and part of\nthat is because its commitment to enforce the values for which it stands is\nbecoming ambiguous in the eyes of many member states. The Commonwealth is not\na private club of the governments or the secretariat. It belongs to the people\nof the Commonwealth.\"\n\nIn the end, two-thirds of the EPG's 106 urgently recommended reforms were\nreferred to study groups, an act described by one EPG member as having them\n\"kicked into the long grass\". There was no agreement to create the recommended\nposition of human rights commissioner, instead a ministerial management group\nwas empowered with enforcement: the group includes alleged human rights\noffenders. It was agreed to develop a charter of values for the Commonwealth\nwithout any decision on how compliance with its principles would be enforced.\n\nThe result of the effort was that a new Charter of the Commonwealth was signed\nby Queen Elizabeth II on 11 March 2013 at Marlborough House, which opposes\n\"all forms of discrimination, whether rooted in gender, race, colour, creed,\npolitical belief or other grounds\"."

Entry was finally achieved in 1973. Queen Elizabeth was one of the few\nremaining links between the UK and the Commonwealth. Historian Ben Pimlott\nargues that joining Europe \"constituted the most decisive step yet in the\nprogress of severance of familial ties between the United Kingdom and its\nformer Empire... It reduced the remaining links to sentimental and cultural\nones, and legal niceties.\"\n\nThe newly independent countries of Africa and Asia concentrated on their own\ninternal political and economic development, and sometimes their role in the\nCold War. The United States, international agencies, and the Soviet Union\nbecame important players, and the British role receded. While there was\nopposition to British entry into the EEC from many countries, such as\nAustralia, others preferred the economic advantages brought by British access\nto the Common Market. The historic ties between the former dominion nations\nand the United Kingdom were rapidly fraying. The Canadian economy increasingly\nfocused on trade with the United States, and not on trade with the United\nKingdom or other Commonwealth nations. Internal Canadian disputes revolved\naround the growing American cultural and economic presence, and the strong\nforce of Quebec nationalism. In 1964, the Maple Leaf flag replaced the\nCanadian Ensign, with Gregory Johnson describing it as \"the last gasp of\nempire\". Australia and New Zealand were generally opposed to the United\nKingdom's entry and exerted considerable influence on the eventual terms of\naccession in 1972, for which the United Kingdom agreed to transitional\narrangements and monetary compensation to protect important export markets.\nRussell Ward summarises the period in economic terms: \"In fact the United\nKingdom, as Australia's chief trading partner, was being very rapidly replaced\njust at this time by the United States and an economically resurgent Japan,\nbut most people were scarcely aware of this.... It was feared that British\nentry into the Common Market was bound to mean abolition, or at least scaling\ndown, of preferential tariff arrangements for Australians goods.\""

Commonwealth membership has been\ncredited with popularising the game in the country, which was never in the\nBritish Empire.\n\nMany Commonwealth nations play similar sports that are considered\nquintessentially British in character, rooted in and developed under British\nrule or hegemony, including cricket, association football, rugby football,\nfield hockey and netball. These ties are particularly strong between the\nUnited Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa across rugby union,\ncricket, netball, and field hockey, with Australia in rugby league, with the\nCaribbean nations in cricket and netball, and with the Indian subcontinent in\ncricket and hockey. Canada, by contrast, is dominated by North American\nsports, including baseball instead of cricket, basketball rather than netball,\nice hockey rather than field hockey and Canadian football, rather than rugby\nunion or league. Canada does, however, maintain small enthusiastic communities\nin all the more traditional Commonwealth sports, having reached the World Cup\nin each of them, and is the homeplace of the Commonwealth Games, hosting the\ninaugural edition in Hamilton in 1930.\n\nThis shared sporting landscape has led to the development of friendly national\nrivalries between the main sporting nations that have often defined their\nrelations with each other, and in the cases of India, Australia and New\nZealand, have played a major part in defining their emerging national\ncharacter (in cricket, rugby league and rugby union). Indeed, said rivalries\npreserved close ties by providing a constant in international relationships,\neven as the Empire transformed into the Commonwealth. Externally, playing\nthese sports is seen to be a sign of sharing a certain Commonwealth culture;\nthe adoption of cricket at schools in Rwanda is seen as symbolic of the\ncountry's move towards Commonwealth membership. More broadly, Rwanda's\nmembership of the Commonwealth has been credited with helping popularise\ncricket in the country, with both men and women playing it in orphanages,\nschools, universities and cricket clubs.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games alongside the youth version, a quadrennial multi-sports\nevent held in the middle year of an Olympic cycle is the most visible\ndemonstration of these sporting ties. The Games include standard multi-sports\ndisciplines like athletics, swimming, gymnastics, weightlifting, boxing, field\nhockey, and cycling, but also includes sports popular in the Commonwealth that\nare distinct to the Games such as netball, squash and lawn bowls. They are\nalso more avowedly political than events like the Olympics, promoting what are\nseen as Commonwealth values; historically, a history of shared military\nendeavour was celebrated and promoted, parasport and disability sport is fully\nintegrated, and the Commonwealth Games Federation has publicly backed the\nrights of LGBT people, despite the continuing criminalisation of homosexuality\nin many Commonwealth countries."
