As of May 2025,[update] the IHO\ncomprised 102 member states.\n\nA principal aim of the IHO is to ensure that the world's seas, oceans and\nnavigable waters are properly surveyed and charted. It does this through the\nsetting of international standards and through its capacity building programs\nand offices.\n\nThe IHO enjoys observer status at the United Nations, where it is the\nrecognized competent authority on hydrographic surveying and nautical\ncharting. When referring to hydrography and nautical charting in conventions\nand similar instruments, it is the IHO standards and specifications that are\nnormally used."

        "generated_section_content_md": "During the 19th century, many maritime nations established hydrographic\noffices to provide means for improving the navigation of naval and merchant\nvessels by providing nautical publications, nautical charts, and other\nnavigational services. There were substantial differences in hydrographic\nprocedures charts, and publications. In 1889, an International Maritime\nConference was held at Washington, D.C., and it was proposed to establish a\n\"permanent international commission.\" Similar proposals were made at the\nsessions of the International Congress of Navigation held at Saint Petersburg\nin 1908 and the International Maritime Conference held at Saint Petersburg in\n1912.\n\nIn 1919, the national Hydrographers of Great Britain and France cooperated in\ntaking the necessary steps to convene an international conference of\nHydrographers. London was selected as the most suitable place for this\nconference, and on 24 July 1919, the First International Conference opened,\nattended by the Hydrographers of 24 nations. The object of the conference was\n\"To consider the advisability of all maritime nations adopting similar methods\nin preparation, construction, and production of their charts and all\nhydrographic publications; of rendering the results in the most convenient\nform to enable them to be readily used; of instituting a prompt system of\nmutual exchange of hydrographic information between all countries; and of\nproviding an opportunity to consultations and discussions to be carried out on\nhydrographic subjects generally by the hydrographic experts of the world.\"\nThis is still the major purpose of the IHO.\n\nAs a result of the 1919 Conference, a permanent organization was formed and\nstatutes for its operations were prepared. The IHB, now the IHO, began its\nactivities in 1921 with 18 nations as members. The Principality of Monaco was\nselected as the seat of the Organization as a result of the offer of Albert I\nof Monaco to provide suitable accommodation for the Bureau in the\nPrincipality.\n\nThe International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) was established in June 1921\nas the International Hydrographic Bureau (IHB), with Vice Admiral Sir John\nParry, KCB of the United Kingdom serving as its first President. In 1970,\nunder the leadership of Guy Chatel of France, the organization adopted its\ncurrent name as part of a new International Convention on the IHO, which was\nagreed upon by its member nations. The term \"International Hydrographic\nBureau\" continued to describe the IHO's secretariat until 8 November 2016,\nwhen a major revision to the Convention took effect. Following this change,\nthe secretariat was renamed the \"IHO Secretariat,\" which consists of an\nelected Secretary-General, two supporting Directors, and a small permanent\nstaff (18 in 2020) at the Organization\u2019s headquarters in Monaco."

Since 8 November 2016,\nupon the entry in to force of revisions to the Convention on the IHO, the\nsecretariat is headed by a Secretary-General, supported by two Directors, with\nAustralia's Robert Ward serving as the first Secretary-General. As before, all\nthree senior members of the secretariat continue to be elected to their\npositions by the Member States at the regular Assembly of the IHO (formerly,\nIHO Conferences). The secretariat staff comprise a number of technical\nspecialists, administrators, and support personnel. The bulk of the IHO's\ntechnical and specialist expertise comes from Member States' personnel, often\nassisted by invited industry experts, who all provide technical contributions\nthrough participation in various IHO committees and working groups. A Council,\ncomprising a sub-set of all the IHO Member States, meets annually and oversees\nthe work of the IHO. A full description, together with details of the workings\nof all the organs of the IHO is available on the IHO website: www.iho.int"

To develop and standardize\nits member states' hydrographic survey capabilities, the IHO worked with the\nInternational Federation of Surveyors (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale des\nG\u00e9om\u00e8tres) and the International Cartographic Association (ICA) to create the\nIHO's Standards of Competence. These standards are used to educate and train\nmember states' respective hydrographic offices and nautical chart makers.\nAdditionally, the IHO also creates syllabi higher education institutions who\nteach hydrography and nautical navigation. The IHO also has an Advisory Board\nwhich is tasked with supervising and approving member states' education and\ntraining programs."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Since 1968, the IHO has regularly published updated editions of the Standards\nof Hydrographic Surveys, with the most recent being published in 2008. Each of\nthese publications was designed to incorporate technological advancements and\ninternational shipping demands. This is especially true with regards to the\nrise of electronic navigation equipment in the 1980s.\n\nThe IHO also works to standardize the specifications, style, and symbols used\nin producing nautical charts. In 1971, the IHO was able to get its member\nstates to use one single chart series, also known as INT charts. According to\nthis IHO agreement, if one member state wants to publish a chart for an area\ncovered by another member's existing chart, the duplicate must be created\nusing the same data as the original chart. IHO Publication M-4, which was\npublished in 1984, set specific international standards for nautical charts.\n\nThe advent of the Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS) made\nit clear to the IHO it also needed to standardize how electronic navigational\ndata is transferred and displayed on ships. Electronic chart data was\nstandardized and categorized in an international database referred to as\nElectronic Navigational Charts (ENCs). The way this data is transferred from\npublishers to users was also standardized, as was the display and capabilities\nof the ECDIS."

The IHO\npublishes the international standards related to charting and hydrography,\nincluding S-57, _IHO Transfer Standard for Digital Hydrographic Data_ , the\nencoding standard that is used primarily for electronic navigational charts.\n\nIn 2010, the IHO introduced a new, contemporary hydrographic geospatial\nstandard for modelling marine data and information, known as S-100. S-100 and\nany dependent product specifications are underpinned by an on-line registry\naccessible via the IHO website. S-100 is aligned with the ISO 19100 series of\ngeographic standards, thereby making it fully compatible with contemporary\ngeospatial data standards.\n\nBecause S-100 is based on ISO 19100, it can be used by other data providers\nfor their maritime-related (non-hydrographic) data and information. Various\ndata and information providers from both the government and private sector are\nnow using S-100 as part of the implementation of the e-Navigation concept that\nhas been endorsed by the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO).\n\nAnother in the series of publications of interest is S-23, _Limits of Oceans\nand Seas_. The 3rd edition dates back to 1953 while the potential 4th edition,\nstarted in 1986, has remained a draft since 2002. It was distributed to IHO\nmembers, but its official publication has been suspended pending agreement\nbetween South Korea and Japan regarding the international standard name of the\nsea called \"Japan Sea\" in the 1953 edition."
