CIFOR, which merged with World Agroforestry (known by the acronym\nICRAF) on 1 January 2019, is the forestry and agroforestry research center of\nCGIAR, a network of 15 research centers around the world that focus on\nagricultural research for sustainable development, working closely with\ngovernments and other partners to help develop evidence-based solutions to\nproblems related to sustainable agriculture and natural resource management.\n\nCIFOR-ICRAF research is intended to \"deliver actionable evidence and solutions\nto transform how land is used and how food is produced: conserving and\nrestoring ecosystems, responding to the global climate, malnutrition,\nbiodiversity and desertification crises.\" It also contributes to the United\nNations Sustainable Development Goals, commitments under the Rio Convention,\nincluding the Paris agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate\nChange."

CIFOR's\nmultidisciplinary approach considers the underlying drivers of deforestation\nand degradation, which often lie outside the forestry sector: forces such as\nagriculture, infrastructure development, trade and investment policies, and\nlaw enforcement.\n\nCIFOR has its headquarters in Bogor, Indonesia. The current Director General\nis Robert Nasi. It has three regional offices: in Burkina Faso (West Africa),\nCameroon (Central Africa) and Kenya (East and South Africa). It has project\noffices in Ethiopia and Zambia (Africa), Vietnam and Laos (Asia), and Brazil\nand Peru (Latin America). CIFOR is one of 15 centers within the Consultative\nGroup on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).\n\nIn implementing its research, CIFOR collaborates with other centers within the\nCGIAR \u2013 the World Agroforestry Centre, the International Center for Tropical\nAgriculture (CIAT) and Bioversity International \u2013 to conduct the CGIAR\nConsortium Research Programme _Forests, Trees and Agroforestry_ (also known as\nCRP6). CRP6 objective is to enhance the management and use of forests,\nagroforestry and tree genetic resources across the landscape, from forests to\nfarms."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Although many link CIFOR's creation to the 1992 Earth Summit because it came\ninto existence the following year, the discussions that led to founding CIFOR\npredated the Earth Summit by several years. In 1991, the CGIAR appointed the\nAustralian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) as the\nimplementing agency responsible for establishing CIFOR and setting up a board\nof trustees. CIFOR's Establishment Agreement was signed by Australia, Sweden,\nSwitzerland, and the United States; the Agreement was lodged with the United\nNations and CIFOR's legal identity as an international organisation was\nconsolidated with a Host Country Agreement between the new Board and the\nGovernment of Indonesia in May 1993.\n\nOver time, CIFOR increased the focus of its research on forest policy rather\nthan on technical forestry or tree breeding, in order to complement the\nefforts of national and private-sector institutes. Instead of having\nlaboratories, CIFOR would be a 'center without walls', marshaling\ninterdisciplinary research teams in collaboration with partners to tackle\nforest policy changes."

        "generated_section_content_md": "CIFOR's first strategy, set out in 1996, provided the foundations and\ndirection for research that affected the understanding and practice of forest\nmanagement throughout the tropics. But the world's forests and the way they\nare perceived have changed dramatically since CIFOR was established.\n\nForemost among many changes is that forests are today centre-stage in the\nglobal debate on how to tackle climate change. Almost 20 per cent of global\ncarbon emissions are caused by deforestation, and so curbing forest loss is a\nway to reduce global warming. Also the promotion of biofuels by governments\nconcerned about global warming is driving forest clearance in some areas.\n\nTo respond to these and other challenges, CIFOR devised a new strategy for a\nnew era. Approved by the Board of Trustees in May 2008, the strategy will\nguide CIFOR's work until 2018."

The project aimed to\nprovide data on the ways that poor people depend on forest resources, in order\nto both inform mainstream forest policy design and to contribute to the design\nof policies and projects to alleviate poverty, and thereby contribute to\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goal of 50% poverty reduction by 2015.\n\nIn order for the socioeconomic data to be uniform and therefore comparable\nacross countries and project sites, research partners (mainly PhD students)\nfrom a number of universities and research institutes collected quarterly data\nat the household and village level using standardized definitions,\nquestionnaires and methods. The study sites were chosen to obtain\nrepresentative coverage of geographical regions, forest types, forest tenure\nregimes, levels of poverty, infrastructure and market access, and population\ndensity.\n\nPreliminary results from the study\u2019s global database showed that among those\nsurveyed, forest income \u2013 on average \u2013 constituted more than one fifth of\ntotal household income, while environmental income (forest and non-forest)\nmade up more than one fourth."
