        "generated_section_content_md": "Intergovernmental organization\n\n**BRICS** is an intergovernmental organization comprising ten countries \u2013\n**B** razil, **R** ussia, **I** ndia, **C** hina, **S** outh Africa, Egypt,\nEthiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The idea of a BRICS-\nlike group can be traced back to Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov and\nto the two forums RIC (Russia, India, China) and IBSA (India, Brazil, South\nAfrica). BRIC was originally a term coined by British economist Jim O'Neill\nand later championed by his employer Goldman Sachs in 2001 to designate the\ngroup of emerging markets. The first summit in 2009 featured the founding\ncountries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, where they adopted the acronym\n**BRIC** and formed an informal diplomatic club where their governments could\nmeet annually at formal summits and coordinate multilateral policies. In April\n2010, South Africa attended the 2nd BRIC summit as a guest. In September 2010\nthey joined the organization which was then renamed BRICS, and attended the\n3rd BRICS summit in 2011 as a full member. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the\nUnited Arab Emirates attended their first summit as member states in 2024 in\nRussia. Indonesia officially joined as a member state in early 2025, becoming\nthe first Southeast Asian member. The acronym **BRICS+** (in its expanded form\n**BRICS Plus**) has been informally used to reflect new membership since 2024.\n\nSome in the West consider BRICS the alternative to the G7. Others describe the\ngrouping as an incoherent joining of countries around increasing anti-Western\nand anti-American objectives. Together BRICS has implemented competing\ninitiatives such as the New Development Bank, the BRICS Contingent Reserve\nArrangement, BRICS PAY, the BRICS Joint Statistical Publication and the BRICS\nbasket reserve currency. In its first 15 years BRICS has established almost 60\nintra-group institutions, and think tanks to dialogues, covering agenda in 34\nsubjects. The original five members and Indonesia are also part of the G20.\nBRICS has received both praise and criticism from numerous commentators and\nworld leaders."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Collective action in the political arena in the late 1990s was present before\nthe economic rationale of BRICS. The idea of a multipolar group like BRICS can\nbe traced back to Yevgeny Primakov during his term as Minister of Foreign\nAffairs of Russia. He reiterated the idea in New Delhi in 1998. The forums RIC\n(Russia, India, China) and IBSA (India, Brazil, South Africa) predated and\nplayed an important role in the creation of BRIC and subsequently BRICS.\n\nThe New Development Bank, headquartered in Shanghai, China, is the premier\ninstitution of BRICS.\n\nThe term _BRIC_ , as compared to the alternate term _CRIB_ , was originally\ndeveloped in the context of foreign investment strategies. It was introduced\nin the 2001 publication, _Building Better Global Economic BRICs_ by Jim\nO'Neill, then head of global economics research at Goldman Sachs and later\nChairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. O'Neill now regards the BRICS\ngroup as a failed project. In a 2021 article for _Project Syndicate_ he wrote\nthat the BRICS countries \"have so far proven incapable of uniting as a\nmeaningful global force\" and felt in 2024 that \"each year also brings further\nconfirmation that the grouping serves no real purpose beyond generating\nsymbolic gestures and lofty rhetoric\".\n\nThe foreign ministers of the initial four BRIC states (Brazil, Russia, India,\nand China) met in New York City in September 2006 at the margins of the\nGeneral Debate of the UN Assembly, beginning a series of high-level meetings.\nA full-scale diplomatic meeting was held in Yekaterinburg, Russia, on 16 June\n2009.\n\nThe BRIC group's first formal summit, also held in Yekaterinburg, commenced on\n16 June 2009, with Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Dmitry Medvedev, Manmohan Singh,\nand Hu Jintao, the respective leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, all\nattending. The summit's focus was on improving the global economic situation\nand reforming financial institutions amid the Great Recession. There was also\ndiscussion of how the four countries could better cooperate in the future, and\nways developing countries, such as three-fourth of the BRIC members, could\nbecome more involved in global affairs.\n\nIn the aftermath of the 2009 Yekaterinburg summit, the BRIC nations announced\nthe need for a new global reserve currency, which would have to be \"diverse,\nstable and predictable\". Although their statement did not directly criticize\nthe perceived dominance of the US dollar (as Russia had in the past) it did\nspark a fall in the value of the dollar against other major currencies."

The group was renamed\n_BRICS_ to represent the addition of _South Africa_ to the original four BRIC\nmembers. At the third BRICS summit in 2011 in Sanya, China, South African\npresident Jacob Zuma represented the country as a full member for the first\ntime."

However, the proposed loan was\nconditional on IMF voting reforms. In March 2013, during the fifth BRICS\nsummit in Durban, the member countries agreed to create a global financial\ninstitution to cooperate with the western-dominated IMF and World Bank. They\nplanned to set up this New Development Bank (known at the time as the \"BRICS\nDevelopment Bank\") by 2014.\n\nAt the BRICS leaders meeting in Saint Petersburg in September 2013, China\ncommitted $41 billion towards the pool; Brazil, India, and Russia $18 billion\neach; and South Africa $5 billion. China, which held the world's largest\nforeign exchange reserves and contributed the bulk of the currency pool,\nwanted a more significant managing role. China also wanted to be the location\nof the reserve. In October 2013, Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said\nthat creating a $100 billion in funds designated to steady currency markets\nwould be taken in early 2014. The Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega,\nconfirmed that the fund would be created by March 2014. However, by April\n2014, the currency reserve pool and development bank had yet to be set up, and\nthe date was rescheduled to 2015.\n\nIn July 2014, during the sixth BRICS summit in Fortaleza, the BRICS members\nsigned a document to create the US$100 billion New Development Bank and a\nreserve currency pool worth over another US$100 billion. Documents on\ncooperation between BRICS export credit agencies and an agreement of\ncooperation on innovation were also signed.[_citation needed_] The Fortaleza\nsummit was followed by a BRICS meeting with the Union of South American\nNations presidents in Bras\u00edlia."

The 2020 BRICS\nsummit was held virtually in St. Petersburg, Russia, and discussed how to\nhandle the COVID-19 pandemic and how to fix the multilateral system via\nreforms. During the 13th BRICS summit, in 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra\nModi called for a transparent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 under\nthe World Health Organization with the full cooperation of \"all countries\",\nand Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke directly afterwards, calling on BRICS\ncountries to \"oppose politicisation\" of the process.\n\nIn May 2023, South Africa announced that it would be giving diplomatic\nimmunity to Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials so that they could\nattend the 15th BRICS Summit despite the ICC arrest warrant for Putin. In July\n2023, the Russian president announced that he would not personally attend the\nBRICS summit in Johannesburg on 22\u201324 August despite good relations with the\nSouth African government. Russian news channels noted that Putin would\nremotely participate online in all BRICS leaders' sessions, including its\nBusiness Forum, and also deliver his remarks virtually.\n\nIn the first 15 years of BRICS, it produced hundreds of decisions and complied\nwith a majority of them. BRICS has established almost 60 intra-group\ninstitutions and a network including think tanks and dialogues in various\nareas. The group has an agenda of over 30 subjects. These groups include:\nBRICS Business Council, BRICS Think Tanks Council, BRICS Women's Business\nAlliance, BRICS Business Forum, and the BRICS Academic Forum. At Kazan the\nestablishment of a BRICS Deep-Sea Resources International Research Center and\na BRICS Digital Ecosystem Cooperation Network was announced.\n\nIn 2021 BRICS formally agreed to work together to build a satellite\nconstellation and share remote sensing satellite data from this. The\nconstellation will have six existing satellites from China, Russia and India.\nIn 2023, Russia proposed that the other BRICS members could build a joint\nresearch station on its space station."

On 30 November 2023, incoming Foreign Minister of\nArgentina Diana Mondino confirmed that Argentina would not join the BRICS.

As of April 2024, the matter is still under\nconsideration. The organizers touted the expansion as part of a plan to build\na competing multipolar world order that uses Global South countries to\nchallenge and compete against the western-dominated world order. _China Daily_\nused the expansion to claim that more developing countries were interested in\njoining BRICS.\n\nOn 24 October 2024, an additional 13 countries, namely Algeria, Belarus,\nBolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey,\nUganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, were invited to participate as \"partner\ncountries\".

They uphold drastically different\npolitical systems, from vibrant liberal democracies in Brazil and South Africa\nto entrenched oligarchy in Russia, and their economies are poorly integrated\nand differ in size by orders of magnitude. She also claimed that the\nsignificant difference in GDP influences the reserves: China accounts for over\n41% of the contribution, which in turn leads to its bigger political say\nwithin the association.\n\nA multi-year study at Tufts University published in July 2023 found that the\n\"common portrayal of BRICS as a China-dominated group primarily pursuing\nanti-U.S. agendas\" was misplaced. The study asserted: \"The BRICS countries\nconnect around common development interests and a quest for a multipolar world\norder in which no single power dominates. Yet BRICS consolidation has turned\nthe group into a potent negotiation force that now challenges Washington's\ngeopolitical and economic goals\".\n\nAccording to the Atlantic Council's Thomas Hill in December 2023, the de-\ndollarization efforts within BRICS, particularly in North Africa, present a\nsignificant challenge to US interests. Replacing the dollar could limit the\nUS's ability to run deficits and maintain low interest rates, and undermine\nthe effectiveness of US sanctions and SWIFT.\n\nMichael Kugelman writes in BBC that \"Brics projects meant to reduce reliance\non the US dollar likely aren\u2019t viable, because many member states\u2019 economies\ncannot afford to wean themselves off of it.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary and White House National Security Advisor have\nsaid that BRICS isn't seen as becoming a geopolitical rival. Treasury\nSecretary Janet Yellen has largely dismissed BRICS efforts at dedollarisation.\nFollowing the announcement of the expansion of BRICS in 2023, the US National\nSecurity Advisor stated that it does not possess a \"serious challenge\".\n\nIn November 2024 in a post on Truth Social, United States president-elect\nDonald Trump threatened a 100% U.S. tariff on countries that pursued a BRICS\ncurrency or moved to favor another currency instead of the U.S. dollar. As\nU.S. president he announced the same on his first day in office during his\nsecond term. On 31 January 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social to \"go\nfind another sucker Nation\" with respect to BRICS. In February 2025, in a\npress briefing, he stated that \"BRICS is dead\". He went on to say that BRICS\nis silent following his \"150%\" tariff threat.\n\nJoseph Nye writes in January 2025 that BRICS, \"as a means of escaping\ndiplomatic isolation, it is certainly useful to Russia\"; the same goes for\nIran. Nye writes that the expansion of the BRICS could bring in more \"intra-\norganizational rivalries\", limiting the groups' effectiveness.\n\nMelissa Pistilli writes that at the 2024 BRICS summit President Putin seemed\nto back away from \"aggressive calls for de-dollarization [...] but rather to\ndeter the \"weaponization\" of the US dollar\"."

Coughlin also noted the contradictions within the organization,\nsuch as the border dispute between China and India, and called for greater\nWestern engagement with India as part of a new strategic alliance.\n\nIn 2024, Jim O'Neill comments the grouping merely generates rhetoric and\nsymbolism."
