The work of the commission had\nto concern itself only with questions that were of common interest to East and\nWest, as to not cause confrontation. However, since the fall of the Soviet\nUnion, the economic commissions of the United Nations have been expanding\ntheir activities in the former Soviet republics."

The Committee\nprovides collective policy direction in the area of environment and\nsustainable development, prepares ministerial meetings, develops international\nenvironmental law and supports international initiatives in the region. CEP\nworks to support countries to enhance their environmental governance and\ntransboundary cooperation as well as strengthen implementation of the UNECE\nregional environmental commitments and advance sustainable development in the\nregion.\n\nIts main aim is to assess countries' efforts to reduce their overall pollution\nburden and manage their natural resources, to integrate environmental and\nsocioeconomic policies, to strengthen cooperation with the international\ncommunity, to harmonize environmental conditions and policies throughout the\nregion and to stimulate greater involvement of the public and environmental\ndiscussions and decision-making.\n\nCEP is the overall governing body of UNECE environmental activities. The\ncommittee's work is based on several strategic pillars:\n\n* Providing the secretariat to the \"Environment for Europe\" process and participating in the regional promotion of Agenda 21;\n* Developing and carrying-out of UNECE Environmental Performance Reviews in the UNECE countries non-members of OECD;\n* Overseeing UNECE activities on environmental monitoring, assessment and reporting;\n* Increasing the overall effectiveness of UNECE multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and facilitating the exchange of experience on MEAs' implementation. See UNECE Espoo Convention, Aarhus Convention, Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes and Convention on the Transboundary Effects of Industrial Accidents.\n* Participating and/or facilitating the exchange of experience in a number of cross-sectoral activities undertaken under the leadership of UNECE (e.g. education for sustainable development, transport, health and environment, green building), or in partnership with other organizations (e.g. environment and security initiative, European environment and health process)."
