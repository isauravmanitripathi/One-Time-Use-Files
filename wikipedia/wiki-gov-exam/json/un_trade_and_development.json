        "generated_section_content_md": "Permanent intergovernmental body\n\nThe Headquarters of UNCTAD are located at the Palais des Nations in Geneva.\n\n**UN Trade and Development** (**UNCTAD**) is an intergovernmental organization\nwithin the United Nations Secretariat that promotes the interests of\ndeveloping countries in world trade. It was established in 1964 by the United\nNations General Assembly (UNGA) as the **United Nations Conference on Trade\nand Development** but rebranded to its current name on the occasion of its\n60th anniversary in 2024. It reports to both the General Assembly and the\nUnited Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). UNCTAD is composed of 195\nmember states and works with non-governmental organizations worldwide; its\npermanent secretariat is at UNOG in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nThe primary objective of UNCTAD is to formulate policies relating to all\naspects of development, including trade, aid, transport, finance and\ntechnology. It was created in response to concerns among developing countries\nthat existing international institutions like GATT (since replaced by the\nWorld Trade Organization), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the\nWorld Bank were not properly organized to handle the particular problems of\ndeveloping countries; UNCTAD would provide a forum where developing nations\ncould discuss and address problems relating to their economic development.\n\nOne of UNCTAD's principal achievements was conceiving and implementing the\nGeneralized System of Preferences (GSP), which promotes the export of\nmanufactured goods from developing countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, UNCTAD\nwas closely associated with the New International Economic Order (NIEO), a set\nof proposals that sought to reduce economic dependency and inequality between\ndeveloping and developed countries.\n\nUNCTAD conferences ordinarily take place every four years, with the first\noccurring in Geneva in 1964; fifteen subsequent meetings have taken place\nworldwide, with the most recent held in Bridgetown, Barbados, from 3\u20138 October\n2021 (albeit virtually, due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\n\nUNCTAD has 400 staff members and a biannual (2010\u20132011) regular budget of\nUS$138 million in core expenditures and US$72 million in extra-budgetary\ntechnical assistance funds. It is a member of the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment Group, a consortium of UN entities that work to promote\nsustainable socioeconomic development."

The conference in New Delhi was an opportunity for\nschemes to be finally approved. The conference provided a major impetus in\npersuading the North to follow up on UNCTAD I resolutions, in establishing\ngeneralized preferences. The target for private and official flows to LDCs was\nraised to 1% of the North's GNP, but the developed countries failed to achieve\nthe target by a specific date. This has proven a continuing point of debate at\nUNCTAD conferences.\n\nThe conference led to the International Sugar Agreement, which seeks to\nstabilize world sugar prices."

In\nSantiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite\npreconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and\nbetween those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in\nthe voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the\nLatin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal\ndissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final\nagreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that\nfurther research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm\ncommitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed\nby the conference."

An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper of April\n1979 highlights one reason for success as being down to the 1973 Oil Crisis\nand the encouragement of LDCs to make gains through producers of other\ncommodities. The principal result of the conference was the adoption of the\nIntegrated Programme for Commodities. The programme covered the principal\ncommodity exports and its objectives aside from the stabilisation of commodity\nprices were: \"Just and remunerative pricing, taking into account world\ninflation\", the expansion of processing, distribution and control of\ntechnology by LDCs and improved access to markets.\n\nUNCTAD V, held in Manila in 1979 in the wake of the Nairobi Conference,\nfocused on the key issues of protectionism in developing countries and the\nneed for structural change, trade in commodities and manufacturing aid and\ninternational monetary reform, technology, shipping, and economic co-operation\namong developing countries. An Overseas Development Institute briefing paper\nwritten in 1979 focuses its attention on the key issues regarding the LDCs'\nrole as the Group of 77 in the international community."
