The EAS as proposed\nwas to be an ASEAN-led development, with the summit to be linked to ASEAN\nsummit meetings. However, the issue was to which countries beyond those in\nASEAN the EAS was to be extended.\n\nThe decision to hold the EAS was reached during the 2004 ASEAN Plus Three\nsummit and the initial 16 members determined at the ASEAN Plus Three\nMinisterial Meeting held in Laos at the end of July 2005.\n\nCredit for advancing the forum during the 2004 ASEAN Plus Three summit has\nbeen attributed to Malaysia."

We welcomed ASEAN's efforts towards further integration and community\n> building, and reaffirmed our resolve to work closely together in narrowing\n> development gaps in our region. We reiterated our support for ASEAN's role\n> as the driving force for economic integration in this region. To deepen\n> integration, we agreed to launch a Track To study on a Comprehensive\n> Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA) among EAS participants. We tasked\n> the ASEAN Secretariat to prepare a time frame for the study and to invite\n> all our countries to nominate their respective participants in it.\n>\n> We welcomed Japan's proposal for an Economic Research Institute for ASEAN\n> and East Asia (ERIA).\n\nThe reality appears however that movement towards such a relationship is a\nlong way-off.

The Track Two report on CEPEA is\ndue to be completed in mid-2008 and at the Third EAS it was agreed this would\nbe considered at the Fourth EAS.\n\nAs noted above the Second EAS welcomed the Economic Research Institute for\nASEAN and East Asia (ERIA).

        "generated_section_content_md": "After the EAS was established the issue arose of whether any future East Asia\nCommunity would arise from the EAS or ASEAN Plus Three. Prior to the creation\nof the EAS it appeared that ASEAN Plus Three would take the role of community\nbuilding in East Asia.\n\nMalaysia felt that it was still the case that the role of the community\nbuilding fell to ASEAN Plus Three shortly before the second EAS despite\n\"confusion\". China apparently agreed whereas Japan and India felt the EAS\nshould be the focus of the East Asian Community.\n\nAfter the first EAS the feasibility of EAS to have a community building role\nwas questioned with Ong Keng Yong, the secretary-general of ASEAN being quoted\nas describing the EAS as little more than a \"brainstorming forum\".\nNevertheless, the Chairman\u2019s Press Statement for the Seventh ASEAN Plus Three\nForeign Ministers\u2019 Meeting[_usurped_] Kuala Lumpur, 26 July 2006 said\n\n> 25\\. The Ministers welcomed the convening of the East Asia Summit as a forum\n> for dialogue on broad strategic, political and economic issues of common\n> interest with the aim of promoting peace, stability and economic prosperity\n> in East Asia. In this respect, they recognized that the East Asia Summit\n> could make a significant contribution to the achievement of the long-term\n> goal of establishing an East Asian community.\n\nIt appeared that over time following the first EAS the focus was less on\nwhether the EAS has a role in community building to what the role and whether\nit was secondary to ASEAN Plus Three. By mid-2006 the Chinese news site Xinhua\nNet suggested the community would arise through a two-phase process with ASEAN\nPlus Three as the first phase and the EAS as the second phase. The China-India\njoint declaration of 21 November 2006 linked, at paragraph 43, the EAS with\nthe East Asian Community process.\n\nThe concentric circle model of the community process with ASEAN at the centre,\nASEAN Plus Three at the next band and the East Asia Summit at the outer band\nis supported by the Second Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation Building\non the Foundations of ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation[_usurped_] which said:\n\n> III. Looking Forward to a Decade of Consolidation and Closer Integration\n> (2007\u20132017)\n>\n>  A. Defining the Objectives and Roles of the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation in\n> the Emerging Regional Architecture\n>\n>  1\\. We reaffirmed that the ASEAN Plus Three Process would remain as the\n> main vehicle towards the long-term goal of building an East Asian community,\n> with ASEAN as the driving force.\n>  ...\n>\n>  3\\. We recognised and supported the mutually reinforcing and complementary\n> roles of the ASEAN Plus Three process and such regional fora as EAS, ARF,\n> APEC and ASEM to promote East Asian community building.\n>\n>  4\\. We reiterated that East Asian integration is an open, transparent,\n> inclusive, and forward-looking process for mutual benefits and support\n> internationally shared values to achieve peace, stability, democracy and\n> prosperity in the region. Guided by the vision for durable peace and shared\n> prosperity in East Asia and beyond, we will stand guided by new economic\n> flows, evolving strategic interactions and the belief to continue to engage\n> all interested countries and organisations towards the realisation of an\n> open regional architecture capable of adapting to changes and new dynamism.\n\nOn any view, community building is not a short-term project. However, after\nthe second EAS, the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was confident that\nthe EAS would lead to an East Asia Community. China had also apparently\naccepted this was the case.\n\nIf achieved the Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia (CEPEA) would\nbe a tangible first step in the community building process. The second EAS\nseems to have increased confidence in CEPEA but is still only a proposal.\n\nIt has been suggested that as the EAS consists of an \"anti-region\" the\nprospects of it forming a community are less than likely."

As discussed above, some countries are more supportive of\nthe narrower ASEAN Plus Three grouping whereas others support the broader,\nmore inclusive EAS. ASEAN Plus Three, which has been meeting since December\n1997 has a history, including the Chiang Mai Initiative which appears to have\nled to the development of the Asian Monetary Unit. This may be significant for\nthose advocating a broader role for EAS in the future.\n\nThe tension between the groupings extends to the respective members'\nintentions towards future Free Trade Agreements with China and South Korea\nfocused on ASEAN Plus Three and Japan on the broader EAS members.\n\nThe 1997 Asian financial crisis had demonstrated the need for regional\ngroupings and initiatives. It was during this time ASEAN Plus Three had\ncommenced and it was also during this time that the East Asian caucus was\nbeing discussed.\n\nThe EAS is just one regional grouping and some members down play its\nsignificance, the former Australian Prime Minister John Howard has stated that\nthe EAS was secondary as a regional summit to APEC which has on his view a\npremier role. Not all members of the EAS, notably India, are members of APEC.\nHowever, as the EAS meetings are scheduled with the ASEAN Plus Three meetings\n(they both follow the annual ASEAN meetings) and all members of ASEAN Plus\nThree are members of EAS the ability of the two forums to remain relevant\ngiven the existence of the other remains in question. China has stated its\npreference for both EAS and ASEAN Plus Three to exist side by side.\n\nThe relationship between APEC, ASEAN Plus Three and the EAS remained\nunresolved heading into the 2007 APEC meeting. Following the meeting the then\nMalaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi described ASEAN Plus Three as\nthe primary vehicle and implied APEC was the lesser of the three. At the same\ntime a Malaysian commentator writing in a Singaporean newspaper described\nconcentric circles for the three with ASEAN Plus Three at the centre and APEC\nat the outer, also suggested the Nikai Initiative, with its regional OECD like\nplans, might overtaking the remaining role for APEC."
