        "generated_section_content_md": "Intergovernmental forum\n\nThe **G20** or **Group of 20** is an intergovernmental forum comprising 19\nsovereign countries, the European Union (EU), and the African Union (AU). It\nworks to address major issues related to the global economy, such as\ninternational financial stability, climate change mitigation and sustainable\ndevelopment, through annual meetings of Heads of State and Heads of\nGovernment.\n\nThe sovereign states of the G20 (without its international members, like the\nEU or AU) account for around 85% of gross world product (GWP), 75% of\ninternational trade, 56% of the global population, and 60% of the world's land\narea. Including the EU and AU, the G20 comprises 78.9% of global population\nand 83.9% of global CO2 emissions from fossil energy.\n\nThe G20 was founded in 1999 in response to several world economic crises.\nSince 2008, it has convened at least once a year, with summits involving each\nmember's head of government or state, finance minister, or foreign minister,\nand other high-ranking officials; the EU is represented by the European\nCommission and the European Central Bank. Other countries, international\norganizations, and nongovernmental organizations are invited to attend the\nsummits, some permanently. The African Union joined as the 21st member at the\n2023 summit in India and was officially represented at the 2024 summit in\nBrazil.\n\nIn its 2009 summit, the G20 declared itself the primary venue for\ninternational economic and financial cooperation. The group's stature has\nrisen during the subsequent decade, and it is recognised by analysts as\nexercising considerable global influence; it is also criticised for its\nlimited membership, lack of enforcement powers, and for the alleged\nundermining of existing international institutions. Summits are often met with\nprotests, particularly by anti-globalization groups."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The G20 is the latest in a series of post\u2013World War II initiatives aimed at\ninternational coordination of economic policy, which include institutions such\nas the \"Bretton Woods twins\", the International Monetary Fund and the World\nBank, and what is now the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe G20 was foreshadowed at the Cologne summit of the G7 in June 1999, and\nformally established at the G7 Finance Ministers' meeting on 26 September 1999\nwith an inaugural meeting on 15\u201316 December 1999 in Berlin. Canadian finance\nminister Paul Martin was chosen as the first chairman and German finance\nminister Hans Eichel hosted the meeting.\n\nA 2004 report by Colin I. Bradford and Johannes F. Linn of the Brookings\nInstitution asserted the group was founded primarily at the initiative of\nEichel, the concurrent chair of the G7. However, Bradford later described\nthen-Finance Minister of Canada (and future Prime Minister of Canada) Paul\nMartin as \"the crucial architect of the formation of the G20 at finance\nminister level\", and as the one who later \"proposed that the G20 countries\nmove to leaders level summits\". Canadian academic and journalistic sources\nhave also identified the G20 as a project initiated by Martin and his American\ncounterpart then-Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. All acknowledge, however,\nthat Germany and the United States played a key role in bringing their vision\ninto reality.[_citation needed_]\n\nMartin and Summers conceived of the G20 in response to the series of massive\ndebt crises that had spread across emerging markets in the late 1990s,\nbeginning with the Mexican peso crisis and followed by the 1997 Asian\nfinancial crisis, the 1998 Russian financial crisis, and eventually impacting\nthe United States, most prominently in the form of the collapse of the\nprominent hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in the autumn of 1998. It\nillustrated to them that in a rapidly globalizing world, the G7, G8, and the\nBretton Woods system would be unable to provide financial stability, and they\nconceived of a new, broader permanent group of major world economies that\nwould give a voice and new responsibilities in providing it.\n\nThe G20 membership was decided by Eichel's deputy Caio Koch-Weser and\nSummers's deputy Timothy Geithner. According to the political economist Robert\nWade:\n\n> \"Geithner and Koch-Weser went down the list of countries saying, Canada in,\n> Portugal out, South Africa in, Nigeria and Egypt out, and so on; they sent\n> their list to the other G7 finance ministries; and the invitations to the\n> first meeting went out.\""

The issues discussed\nincluded domestic reforms to achieve \"sustained growth\", global energy and\nresource commodity markets, reform of the World Bank and IMF, and the impact\nof demographic changes.\n\nIn 2007, South Africa hosted the secretariat with Trevor A. Manuel, South\nAfrican Minister of Finance as chairperson of the G20.\n\nIn 2008, Guido Mantega, Brazil's Minister of Finance, was the G20 chairman and\nproposed dialogue on competition in financial markets, clean energy, economic\ndevelopment and fiscal elements of growth and development.\n\nOn 11 October 2008 after a meeting of G8 finance ministers, US President\nGeorge W. Bush stated that the next meeting of the G20 would be important in\nfinding solutions to the burgeoning economic crisis of 2008."

Additionally, G20 summits of heads of state or\ngovernment were held.\n\nAfter the 2008 debut summit in Washington, DC, G20 leaders met twice a year:\nin London and Pittsburgh in 2009, and in Toronto and Seoul in 2010.\n\nSince 2011, when France chaired and hosted the G20, the summits have been held\nonly once a year.

The BRICS foreign\nministers subsequently reminded Bishop that \"the custodianship of the G20\nbelongs to all Member States equally and no one Member State can unilaterally\ndetermine its nature and character.\"\n\nThe 2015 G20 Summit in Antalya, Turkey, focused on \"Inclusiveness, Investment,\nand Implementation,\" gathering leaders to address global economic challenges,\ndevelopment, climate change, and urgent issues like terrorism and refugees.\nKey outcomes included the Antalya Action Plan and commitments to financial\nstability, tax regulation, and energy policy.\n\nIn 2016, the G20 framed its commitment to the 2030 Agenda, Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals in three key themes; the promotion of strong sustainable and\nbalanced growth; protection of the planet from degradation; and furthering co-\noperation with low-income and developing countries. At the G20 Summit in\nHangzhou, members agreed on an action plan and issued a high level principles\ndocument to member countries to help facilitate the agenda's implementation.\n\nJapan hosted the 2019 summit.

Norway, like other such states, has little or no voice within\nthe group. St\u00f8re argued that the G20 undermines the legitimacy of\ninternational organizations set up in the aftermath of World War II, such as\nthe IMF, World Bank and United Nations:\n\n> The G20 is a self-appointed group. Its composition is determined by the\n> major countries and powers.

In November 2022, Indonesia and Russia stated that Vladimir\nPutin would not attend the G20 summit in person, but may attend virtually.\nDuring the 2022 summit, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy appeared in a\nvideo statement and repeatedly addressed the assembly as the 'G19' as a means\nof indicating his viewpoint that Russia should be removed from the group.\nDespite the group refusing criticism on Russia directly in 2023 for the war,\nPutin was not present at the G20 summit due to the arrest warrant issued by\nthe ICC in 2024."
