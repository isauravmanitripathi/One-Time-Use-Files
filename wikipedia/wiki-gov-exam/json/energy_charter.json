        "generated_section_content_md": "International cross-border agreement for energy\n\nThe **Energy Charter Treaty** (**ECT**) is an international agreement which\nestablishes a multilateral framework for cross-border cooperation in the\nenergy industry, principally the fossil fuel industry. The treaty covers all\naspects of commercial energy activities including trade, transit, investments\nand energy efficiency. The treaty contains dispute resolution procedures both\nfor States Parties to the Treaty (vis-\u00e0-vis other States) and as between\nStates and the investors of other States, who have made investments in the\nterritory of the former. Full versions of the treaty, both consolidated and\nofficial, are readily accessible.\n\nInitially, the Energy Charter process aimed to integrate the energy sectors of\nthe Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the end of the Cold War into the\nbroader European and world markets. Its role, however, extends beyond\neast\u2013west cooperation and, through legally binding instruments, free trade in\nglobal energy markets and non-discrimination to stimulate foreign direct\ninvestments and global cross-border trade.\n\nAwards and settlements of the international arbitrations put forward by\nbreaking the law of the Energy Charter Treaty are sometimes in the hundreds of\nmillions of dollars. In 2014, the _Yukos_ cases were decided in favour of the\nclaimants on the basis of the treaty with a record-breaking US$50 billion\naward, although appeals continue in courts in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Energy Charter Treaty has been criticized for being a significant obstacle\nto enacting national policies to combat climate change, and for actively\ndisincentivizing national governments from compliance with recent\ninternational climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement due to the threat\nof significant financial loss.\n\nAs of 2023[update], numerous countries have either left or have announced\nplans to leave the ECT. The European Union and Euratom took the final and\nformal step of exiting the Energy Charter Treaty, which will take effect one\nyear after the depository has received the notification."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The beginnings of the Energy Charter date back to a political initiative\nlaunched in Europe in the early 1990s. The end of the Cold War offered an\nunprecedented opportunity to overcome previous economic divisions between the\nnations on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The brightest prospect for mutually\nco-dependent beneficial cooperation was the energy sector, given Europe's\ngrowing energy demand and vast resource availability in post-Soviet nations.\nAdditionally, there was a recognised need to establish a commonly accepted\nfoundation for energy cooperation among the states of Eurasia. By these\nconsiderations, the Energy Charter process was born.\n\nThe original European Energy Charter declaration was signed in The Hague on 17\nDecember 1991. It was a political declaration of principles for international\nenergy cooperation in trade, transit and investment, together with the\nintention to negotiate a legally binding treaty, setting the beginning of the\ndevelopment of the Energy Charter Treaty. One of the final hurdles was to find\nlanguage to ensure national sovereignty over natural resources while\nenshrining the principle of international cooperation to allow outside access\nto those resources. Negotiators also succeeded in assuring Austria and\nSwitzerland that they would not bear an undue transit burden for energy\nresources."

In 2021 the treaty was struck down by\nthe European Court of Justice for intra-EU disputes only. Some areas of\ndiscussion are:\n\n* the standards of protection granted by the treaty;\n* the international responsibility of States for breaches of the treaty;\n* the various procedures available for the vindication of rights under the treaty;\n* the conditions to be satisfied before a claimant's complaint may be considered on the merits;\n* the impact of EU law on claims under the treaty;\n* the treaty's provisions concerning taxation;\n* possible effects of the ECT on climate;\n* possible geopolitical, climate and financial impacts\n\nand also:\n\n* allegedly deleterious effects on states' budgets.\n* Nathalie Bernasconi-Osterwalder, a lawyer at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), criticises the ECT for not having \"more precise definitions of investment protection standards, [for not] set[ting] out responsibilities for investors and [for not] integrat[ing] innovations with respect to dispute settlement to ensure transparency and independence,\" unlike more modern approaches. Moreover, she claims it is following expansionist ambitions.\n* Tania Voon, a Professor in Law at the University of Melbourne, criticises the modernization of the ECT for not including a removal of the art. 47 survival clause, and for failing to introduce \"a distinction between investments based on fossil fuels and those based on renewable energy\" in order to achieve climate goals.\n* Cross-party members of the European Parliament advised the commission to withdraw if modernization is not adequate."

The subsequent Energy Charter Treaty, and in particular Article 19 of\nthe treaty, requires that each Contracting Party \"... shall strive to minimise\nin an economically efficient manner, harmful Environmental Impacts arising\nfrom energy use.\"\n\nBuilding on article 19 of the Energy Charter Treaty, the Protocol on Energy\nEfficiency and Related Environmental Aspects (PEEREA) defines in more detail\nthe policy principles that can promote energy efficiency and provides guidance\non the development of energy efficiency programmes. PEEREA was negotiated,\nopened for signature and entered into force at the same time (16 April 1998)\nas the Energy Charter Treaty.\n\nIn contrast to other activities in the Charter process, the emphasis in the\nwork on energy efficiency is not legally binding, but rather on practical\nimplementation of a political commitment to improve energy efficiency. This is\npromoted through policy discussions based on analysis and exchange of\nexperience between the member countries, invited independent experts and other\ninternational organisations.\n\nThe implementation of PEEREA provides its member countries with a range of\nbest practices and a forum in which to share experiences and policy advice on\nenergy efficiency issues. Within this forum, particular attention is paid to\nnational energy efficiency strategy, taxation, pricing policy in the energy\nsector, environmentally related subsidies and other mechanisms for financing\nenergy efficiency objectives."

The Protocol would amplify and strengthen the treaty\nprovisions on energy transit issues to mitigate some specific operational\nrisks that continue to affect energy transit flows. Negotiations on the text\nof the Transit Protocol began in early 2000 and a compromise text reflecting\nan extended discussion between the European Union and Russia was tabled for\nadoption at the meeting of the Energy Charter Conference on 10 December 2003.\nIt became clear during the meeting that a unanimous decision could not be\nreached on the basis of the compromise text; a complicating factor was that\nenergy issues, including transit, were a subject on the bilateral agenda for\nthe European Union and Russia in the context of Russian negotiations for\naccession to the World Trade Organization. The Protocol negotiations were then\ntemporarily suspended.\n\nIn December 2007, the Energy Charter Conference reaffirmed its support for the\nfinalisation of negotiations and adoption of the Energy Charter Protocol on\nTransit to expand the existing provisions of the treaty. This work proceeded\nuntil October 2011, when the European Union argued that, given current\ndevelopments in the international energy situation and the lack of progress in\nnegotiations and consultations, it appeared no longer opportune to continue\ntalks. A review of the issue at the end of 2015 noted the continued demand for\na multilateral legally-binding framework for energy transit, and recommended\nfurther exploring the basis for negotiations of such an agreement, which could\naddress various aspects of oil, gas and electricity transportation and\ntransit.\n\nThe Energy Charter Treaty includes an obligation of member countries to\nfacilitate energy transit across their territory, in line with the principle\nof freedom of transit, and to secure established transit flows. At the same\ntime, the treaty provisions do not oblige any country to introduce mandatory\nthird-party access."

An objective of the treaty\nis to promote transparency and efficiency in the operation of energy markets,\nbut it is for governments to define the structure of their domestic energy\nsector. Each country is free to decide whether and how its national energy\nresources are developed, and the extent to which its energy sector is open to\nforeign investors.

In October 2006, German chancellor Angela\nMerkel and French president Jacques Chirac proposed the creation of a\n_balanced energy partnership_ between France and Germany, representing the\nEuropean Union, and Russia. Under the agreement, Russia would have to sign the\nEuropean Energy Charter, which, according to a _New York Times_ summary of a\nreport in Russian newspaper _Kommersant_ , Russian President Vladimir Putin\nsaid impinges on Russia's national interests.\n\nIn December 2006, Russia indicated that the ratification of the treaty was\nunlikely due to the provisions requiring third-party access to Russia's\npipelines. On 20 August 2009, it officially informed the depository of the\ntreaty (Government of Portugal) that it did not intend to become a contracting\nparty to the treaty and the related protocol terminating the provisional\napplication of the treaty and the PEEREA starting from 18 October 2009.\n\nNotwithstanding the termination of provisional application of the treaty by\nRussia, the provisions regarding dispute settlements and investment protection\nare still in force for additional twenty years. On 30 November 2009, the\nPermanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, which had been considering this\ncase since 2005 under the UNCITRAL Rules, ruled that former Yukos shareholders\ncan move on to the merits phase of their arbitration claim against the Russian\ngovernment. GML, previously known as Menatep, the principal shareholder in\nYukos, is suing Russia for more than $100 billion in an international\narbitration case under the treaty. The hearings took place in October 2012.\n\nIn July 2014, the international arbitration panel in The Hague unanimously\nruled in favour of the shareholders, awarding $50 billion damages for the\nseizure of assets and dismantling of Yukos. The Russian government has vowed\nnot to comply with the ruling, setting off an international legal dispute\nwhich has resulted in France and Belgium seizing Russian assets for possible\nuse as restitution for the claimants. However, a French court ruled against\nthe seizure by the French authorities, and a Dutch court later overturned the\n$50 billion ruling, arguing Russia had not ratified the Energy Charter Treaty\nand so was not bound by it."

The Arbitration Awards or Settlements are\nsometimes in the hundred of millions of dollars. Disputes concerning\ncompetition (Article 6) and environmental issues (Article 19) the Secretariat\nprovides for bilateral (in the case of competition) or multilateral (in the\ncase of environmental protection) non-binding consultation mechanisms."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Energy Charter Treaty has come under heavy criticism for being an obstacle\nto the transition to renewable energy. Transnational corporations who have\ninvested in fossil fuel production and nuclear power can sue national\ngovernments for loss of profit on their investments as a consequence of the\ntransition to renewable energy. Critics argue that the Energy Charter Treaty\nhas a chilling effect on energy-related legislation. Russia and Norway refused\nto ratify the treaty, and Italy left in 2016, over environmental concerns\nabout ECT. For example, the German energy company RWE has sued the Dutch\ngovernment for \u20ac1.4 billion in compensation for the phasing out of coal power\nplants. In October 2020, the European Parliament voted to end fossil fuel\nprotection under the ECT.\n\nIn late\u20112022, the European Commission was seeking to clarify that the ECT does\nnot apply within the European Union. The Commission says \"the risk of legal\nconflict is such as to render an international agreement incompatible with EU\nlaw\" and adds that EU [member] states should thus \"confirm that the ECT does\nnot apply, and has never applied to intra\u2011EU relations\".\n\nA joint investigation by _The Guardian_ , the Transnational Institute, and\nBerlin\u2011based Powershift, made public in mid\u2011November 2022, revealed opaque\nproceedings, inadequate controls on conflicts of interest for key personnel,\nincluding arbitrators, and potential bias in favor of fossil fuel interests."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Several countries and organisations have proposed withdrawing from the ECT.\nHowever, the Treaty has a \"sunset clause\" that allows lawsuits to be filed for\n20 years after the departure of a member; Italy left the ECT in 2015, but was\nsuccessfully sued in 2022.\n\nIn 2020, Julia Steinberger and Yamina Saheb (both co-authors of the IPCC Sixth\nAssessment Report) initiated an open letter that calls for the withdrawal from\nthe ECT. They justify the call with the claim that the ECT is an obstacle to\nthe Paris Agreement and the European Green Deal. The letter has been signed,\nfor example, by Sandrine Dixson-Decl\u00e8ve, Connie Hedegaard, James K. Galbraith,\nHelga Kromp-Kolb, Rachel Kyte, Thomas Piketty, Olivier de Schutter and Jean-\nPascal van Ypersele. On 15 December 2020, the Spanish minister for ecological\ntransition, Teresa Ribera, supported the idea of withdrawing from it if it was\nnot possible to reach an agreement to make the Energy Charter Treaty\ncompatible with the Paris Agreement. The International Institute for\nSustainable Development describes the possibility of a withdrawal with\nneutralization of the survival clause."

And\non 14 November 2022, Germany announced its intention to withdraw in order to\nbetter tackle climate change. Slovenia had earlier stated its intention to\nwithdraw. Denmark announced in April 2023 that it intends to withdraw.\n\nIn July 2023 the European Commission formally proposed legislation for both\nthe union and its member states to make a \"coordinated and orderly\"\nsimultaneous withdrawal from the ECT.\n\nThe UK government announced in September 2023 that it would consider leaving\nthe \"outdated\" treaty if modernisation was not agreed by that November. In\nFebruary 2024, the United Kingdom announced its plans to withdraw from the\ntreaty due to a failure in negotiations to modernise the treaty. In March\n2024, the European Union countries jointly agreed to leave the ECT. However,\nbefore this will take effect the European Parliament has to agree."
