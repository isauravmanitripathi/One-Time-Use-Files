CONEFO was an\nattempt by President Sukarno of Indonesia to create a new bloc of \"emerging\ncountries\" that would be an alternative power centre to the United Nations and\nto the \"old-established forces\" \u2014 a category in which Sukarno included both\nthe United States and the Soviet Union. It was intended to build on the legacy\nof the 1955 Bandung Conference and the Non-Aligned Movement, by asserting the\ninterests of the Third World and a neutral posture towards the Cold War.\n\nCONEFO was officially established on 7 January 1965, after Sukarno's\ngovernment objected to Malaysia becoming a non-permanent member of the UN\nSecurity Council, at a time of the low-level Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation\nbetween the two countries. An angry Sukarno took Indonesia out of the UN (the\nonly country to have done so) and formed a rival world organization, having\ntaken similar steps when he created the Games of the New Emerging Forces\n(GANEFO) as an alternative to the Olympic Games in 1963. Indonesia constructed\na new building complex in Jakarta to host CONEFO with the financial aid of the\nPeople's Republic of China.\n\nCONEFO never met before it was dissolved on 11 August 1966 by General Suharto\nafter ousting Sukarno from power. Indonesia rejoined the United Nations and\nthe CONEFO complex, now called the MPR/DPR/DPD building, became the seat of\nthe People's Consultative Assembly."
