        "generated_section_content_md": "IDLO began in 1983 as a non-governmental organization (then called\nInternational Development Law Institute) founded by three legal advisors to\ncooperation agencies in Egypt: L. Michael Hager (USA), William T. Loris (USA)\nand Gilles Blanchi (France), with the Board presided by Dr Ibrahim Shihata\n(founder of the OPEC Fund for International Development and Senior Vice-\nPresident and General Counsel of the World Bank from 1983 to 1998). The Board\nalso included, among others, Professor Ren\u00e9 David. The Governments of the\nUnited States and Italy provided the start-up seed money and the Headquarter\nestablishment agreement was signed in Rome in 1988. The Institute changed to\nan intergovernmental organization in 1991 after its first Assembly of Member\nStates in 1990. After the Fall of the Berlin Wall, increased training and\nassistance was provided in the field of legal and judicial reform in\ndeveloping and transition countries. In the second half of the 90s, greater\nattention was also given to sustainable development and the civil society as\nwell as to countries emerging from conflicts if not genocides (e.g. Cambodia,\nRwanda). In 2002, the Institute was renamed International Development Law\nOrganisation. In 2001, IDLO was granted Permanent Observer Status at the\nUnited Nations. In 2014, IDLO opened a branch office in The Hague."

In 2011 IDLO created\nan assessment of traditional and customary justice, arguing that linking\ncustomary and traditional justice in a bottom up approach would be most\neffective.\n\nFinanced by the Italian government, IDLO worked with local experts on the\ncountry's provisional Constitution, holding consultative sessions with\nMogadishu residents, refugees, and the Somali diaspora.\n\nTowards the adoption of the Constitution, IDLO helped produce a comparative\nanalysis of the new draft Constitution, the Constitution of 1960 and the\nTransitional Federal Charter of 2004 and supported the Constitutional Affairs\nand Reconciliation Ministry in hosting a conference on fundamental rights and\ntransitional justice.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the constitution by the National Constitution\nAssembly on 1 August 2012 IDLO drafted a report on providing analysis and\nsuggestions for Justice and Security development under the new constitutional\norder. The report provides a description of steps to be taken during the\nimplementation phase of the constitution, including the establishment of\ninstitutions, development and revision of legislative frameworks, and capacity\nbuilding. It also sketches out dispute resolution mechanisms of the three\nlegal systems in Somalia: xeer, Shari\u2019ah, and the statutory judiciary.\n\nComparing the draft constitution to those from 53 of the 56 member states of\nthe Organization of the Islamic Cooperation, as well as the constitutions of\nItaly and the United States of America, IDLO found that it contained 36 of the\n45 fundamental rights - placing it in the top five of the countries surveyed.\nThe organization also stated that the Somali draft constitution contained 15\nmore than the Constitution of the United States of America."
