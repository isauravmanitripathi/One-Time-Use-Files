        "generated_section_content_md": "European air traffic organisation\n\nThe **European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation** , commonly\nknown as **Eurocontrol** (stylised _EUROCONTROL_), is an international\norganisation working to achieve safe and seamless air traffic management\nacross Europe. Founded in 1963, Eurocontrol currently has 42 member states\nwith headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. It has several local sites as well,\nincluding an Innovation Hub in Br\u00e9tigny-sur-Orge, France, the Aviation\nLearning Centre (ALC) in Luxembourg, and the Maastricht Upper Area Control\nCentre (MUAC) in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The organisation employs\napproximately two thousand people, and operates with an annual budget in\nexcess of half a billion euros.\n\nAlthough Eurocontrol is not an agency of the European Union, the EU has\ndelegated parts of its Single European Sky regulations to Eurocontrol, making\nit the central organisation for coordination and planning of air traffic\ncontrol for all of Europe. The EU itself is a signatory of Eurocontrol and all\nEU member states are presently also members of Eurocontrol. The organisation\nworks with national authorities, air navigation service providers, civil and\nmilitary airspace users, airports, and other organisations. Its activities\ninvolve all gate-to-gate air navigation service operations: strategic and\ntactical flow management, controller training, regional control of airspace,\nsafety-proofed technologies and procedures, and collection of air navigation\ncharges.\n\nThe eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull in 2010 disrupted air traffic over large\nparts of Europe\n\nEurocontrol takes center stage in managing air traffic disruptions within\nEurope to guarantee the continuity of safe and efficient air operations during\ncrises. For instance, the 2010 Icelandic Volcanic Ash Crisis saw the\ninvolvement of Eurocontrol in providing relevant data to the national\nauthorities and air traffic control agencies to reduce airspace closure to a\nminimum. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Eurocontrol supported the\nmonitoring of the steep decline in air traffic through strategic responses\ntoward the adjustment of flight plans and, therefore, mitigating operational\nchallenges. Much of these efforts are managed through the Network Manager\nfunction of Eurocontrol, which enables the real-time monitoring of air traffic\nand oversees the implementation of contingency plans during emergencies such\nas natural calamities, industrial strikes, and adverse weather. This would be\nthe necessary central coordination that sustains the resilience of Europe's\nair traffic network during crises."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Headquarters of Eurocontrol in Brussels\n\nThe Eurocontrol Convention was signed in 1960 and ratified in 1963. Before the\nconvention entered into force in 1963, there were already indications that the\nmatter of national sovereignty would complicate the full implementation of the\norganisation's founding mission. The first European plan for a harmonised air\ntraffic control (ATC) system, proposed in 1962, was beset by the refusal of\nboth France and Britain to comply, largely due to reasons closely linked with\ntheir national military airspace control. The other four original members (the\nFederal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) agreed\nin 1964 to set up a single international air traffic control centre to manage\ntheir upper airspace, settling in the Dutch city of Maastricht.\n\nThe European Parliament at the time expressed concern about the lack of clear\nintergovernmental agreements to ensure common air traffic control services\nacross the continent. In 1979, Eurocontrol signed a working cooperation\nagreement with the European Commission, attempting to create a synergy of\nEurocontrol's technical expertise and EU's regulatory authorities. Several\ninitiatives originating in this period become a lasting element of the\norganisation, such as the Eurocontrol forecasting service, which became\nSTATFOR, as well as the Aeronautical Information Service. By 1986, the\npressure on the European ATC network was so big that a new, wider mandate was\nalready being considered for Eurocontrol, with much of the initiative coming\nfrom ECAC\u2019s Ministers of Transport. Subsequently, ECAC urged all of its member\nstates to join Eurocontrol.\n\nA meeting of Eurocontrol members\n\nA revised Eurocontrol Convention was signed in 1997, renewing the\norganisation's optimism for greater political support, surpassing the original\nvision of the 1960 Convention. In June 1998, Eurocontrol, the European Space\nAgency (ESA) and the European Commission (EC) also signed an agreement\nformalising cooperation in the realm of satellite navigation systems and\nservices. In 1999 the European Commission presented its plan for a Single\nEuropean Sky (SES) to the European Parliament, followed by two high-Level\ngroups (HLG). The HLG reports on SES led to the establishment of the European\nAviation Safety Agency (EASA) and reinforced the European Commission's role as\nthe sole European aviation safety regulator, while acknowledging Eurocontrol's\ntechnical expertise in the implementation of said regulations.\n\nThe early 2000s were marred by several fatal accidents in Europe, such as the\n2001 Linate Airport runway collision and the 2002 \u00dcberlingen mid-air\ncollision, both of which were related to air traffic navigation shortcomings.\nThe pressure was further compounded by the September 11 attacks, increasing\nthe need for a rapid Europe-wide regulatory and coordinating body. By May\n2003, Eurocontrol and NATO had signed a memorandum of cooperation, followed by\na similar memorandum with the European Commission in December 2003. In\nFebruary 2004, Eurocontrol started work on first mandates from the European\nCommission and in April 2004, it adopted the Single European Sky Regulations\n(Package 1). In March 2006, the European Commission's Single European Sky ATM\nResearch (SESAR) Program was launched by the Stakeholder Consultation Group\n(SCG) under Eurocontrol's aegis."

In 2017 it became the first multinational, cross-border, civil-\nmilitary, air navigation service provider since it integrated the military air\ntraffic control of the German and Dutch upper airspace.\n\nIt is the third busiest upper area area control centre (ACC) in Europe after\nthe London Area Control Centre and Karlsruhe ACC in terms of traffic numbers,\nbut the first in terms of flight hours and distance.\n\nMUAC has put in operation innovative technology and productivity enhancements:\na new generation Flight Data Processing System, Integrated Flow Management\nPosition, the Short Term Conflict Alert (STCA), Controller Pilot Data Link\nCommunications (CPDLC) and stripless controller working positions.\n\nTypically, air traffic control sectors at MUAC can handle 55 or more flights\nper hour. The average flight duration is approximately 21 minutes and\ntypically 80% of the traffic is climbing from or descending to the major\nEuropean airports of London, Brussels, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Berlin.\nMaastricht UAC has undoubtedly one of the most complex airspace structures in\nthe world and the traffic flow (up to 5,670 aircraft a day) can be disrupted\nby the many surrounding military airspaces."
