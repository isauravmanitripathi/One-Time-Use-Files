Individually\nand as a group, the G5 nations work to promote dialogue and understanding\nbetween developing and developed countries. The G5 seek to find common\nsolutions to global challenges. In the 21st century, the G5 were understood to\nbe the five largest emerging economies.\n\nThe G8 plus the five largest emerging economies has come to be known as G8+5."

The composition of the five and what is encompassed by the term is\nconstrued differently in different time frames. Initially, the term \"Group of\nFive\" or \"G5\" encompassed the five leading economies of the world, but the use\nof the term changed over time. Nowadays, the term tends to describe the next\ntier of nations whose economies had expanded so substantially as to be\nconstrued in the same category as the world's eight major industrialized\ncountries."

In 1974\nthe United States created the informal Library Group, an unofficial gathering\nof senior financial officials from France, Japan, the United Kingdom, the\nUnited States, and West Germany. These men were called the \"Library Group\"\nbecause they met informally in the library of the White House in Washington,\nD.C.\n\nDuring the 1970s, the term _Group of Five_ came to be identified the top five\nof the world's the leading economies as ranked by per capita GDP. Without the\ninformal meetings of the G5 finance ministers, there would have been no\nsubsequent meetings of G-5 leaders. In 1975, French President Val\u00e9ry Giscard\nd'Estaing invited five other heads of government from Italy, Japan, the United\nKingdom, the United States, and West Germany to a six-party economic summit in\nCh\u00e2teau de Rambouillet. At the time, it was impossible to predict whether this\ninformal gathering would be meaningful or only a public relations event.\n\nIn subsequent years, the group of world leaders expanded to reflect changed\neconomic and political developments:\n\n* 1975 \u2014 the Group of Six (G6)\n* 1976 \u2014 the Group of Seven (G7) was created when Canada joined the G6\n* 1997 \u2014 the Group of Eight (G8) was formed when Russia joined the G7"

The invitation caused the five countries to negotiate amongst\nthemselves about presenting common positions.\n\nThe success of this collaboration led to the growth of the G5 as an\nindependent voice. The G5 expresses common interests and viewpoints in the\nsearch of solutions to major global issues.\n\nA number of cohesive elements bind the G5 together in promoting a constructive\ndialogue between developed and developing countries."
