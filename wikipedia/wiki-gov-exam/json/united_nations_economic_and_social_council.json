        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1945 when the United Nations Charter was originally signed, the Economic\nand Social Council consisted of 18 seats. The formal concept of the United\nNations Regional Groups did not yet exist, and unlike the Security Council,\nthere was no \"gentlemen's agreement\" between the superpowers to assign ECOSOC\nseats. Regardless, with 4 exceptions out of 102 elections (see list), a\nrelatively stable pattern emerged and held until 1960:\n\n* 5 seats to the Permanent Five of the UNSC\n* 4 seats to Latin America\n* 2 seats to Eastern Europe\n* 1 seat to the British Commonwealth\n* 3 seats to the \"Near and Far East\"\n* 3 seats to Western Europe\n\nAs the number of United Nations members grew with decolonization, the pattern\nbegan to break down starting in 1961, with nations in Africa winning elections\nto seats formerly held by Western Europe and the Republic of China (Taiwan).\n\nIn 1965, the Charter was amended to increase the size of ECOSOC to 27 seats,\nand the Regional Groups were formally introduced. The seat distribution\nbecame:\n\n* 5 seats to the Asian Group\n* 3 seats to the Eastern European Group\n* 5 seats to the Latin American and Caribbean Group\n* 7 seats to the Western European and Others Group\n\nIn 1973, the Charter was amended again to increase the size of ECOSOC to 54\nseats. The seat distribution became:\n\n* 14 seats to the African Group\n* 11 seats to the Asia-Pacific Group (renamed from the Asian Group in 2011)\n* 6 seats to the Eastern European Group\n* 10 seats to the Latin American and Caribbean Group\n* 13 seats to the Western European and Others Group"

They increasingly include\na concern for the environmental and social dimensions of development, along\nwith their traditional economic focus. They have set standards for SDG\nimplementation by providing (financial) support through reporting guidelines,\nperformance indicators, and other managerial tools. However, their limited\nresources force them to prioritize; diverse sets of priorities in the region\nonly partially overlap with the SDGs.\n\nThe regional commissions seek to link the global ambitions of the SDGs with\nregional actors, contexts, and priorities. In practice, however, when it comes\nto agenda setting, the regional commissions mostly seek to balance the new\nglobal agenda with their regional priorities and prior agendas."

Some were created before the United Nations existed and were\nintegrated into the system, others were created by the League of Nations and\nwere integrated by its successor, while others were created by the United\nNations itself to meet emerging needs. Each agency must negotiate with the\nCouncil as to what their relationship will look and work like. This leads to a\nsystem where different organizations maintain different types of relationships\nwith the Council.

The Summit aimed to establish ECOSOC as a quality platform for high-\nlevel engagement among member states and with international financial\ninstitutions, the private sector, and civil society on global trends,\npolicies, and action. It resolved to hold biennial high-level Development\nCooperation Forums at the national-leadership level, transforming the high-\nlevel segment of the Council to review trends in international development\ncooperation and promote greater coherence in development activities. At the\nSummit it was also decided to hold annual ministerial-level substantive\nreviews to assess progress in achieving internationally agreed on development\ngoals (particularly the Millennium Development Goals). These \"Annual\nMinisterial Reviews\" will be replaced by the High-Level Political Forum from\n2016 onwards after the new post-MDG/post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals\nare agreed upon.\n\nSubsequent proposals by the High-Level Panel Report on System-Wide Coherence\nin November 2006 aimed to establish a forum within the ECOSOC as a counter-\nmodel to the exclusive clubs of the G8 and G20. The Forum was to comprise 27\nheads of state (L27, corresponding to half of ECOSOC's membership) to meet\nannually and provide international leadership in the development area. This\nproposal however, was not approved by the General Assembly."
