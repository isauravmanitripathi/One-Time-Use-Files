        "generated_section_content_md": "The office of High Commissioner for Refugees has existed since 1921, when it\nwas created by the League of Nations with Norwegian scientist Fridtjof Nansen\nas its first occupant.\n\nThe International Refugee Organization (IRO) was created in 1946 to address\nthe refugee crisis that resulted from World War II. The United Nations\nestablished the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in\n1950 as the successor of the IRO. The 1951 Refugee Convention established the\nscope and legal framework of the agency's work, which initially focused on\nEuropeans uprooted by the war. Beginning in the late 1950s, displacement\ncaused by other conflicts, from the Hungarian Uprising to the decolonization\nof Africa and Asia, broadened the scope of UNHCR's operations. Commensurate\nwith the 1967 Protocol to the Refugee Convention, which expanded the\ngeographic and temporal scope of refugee assistance, UNHCR operated across the\nworld, with the bulk of its activities in developing countries. By its 65th\nanniversary in 2015, the agency had assisted more than 50 million refugees\nworldwide.\n\nAs of June 2020, UNHCR has over 20 million refugees under its mandate.\nConsequently, its annual budget has grown from US$300,000 in 1951 to US$8.6\nbillion in 2019, making it one of the largest UN agencies by expenditure. The\nvast majority of UNHCR's budget comes from voluntary contributions, mostly\nfrom member states; the largest donors are the United States, the European\nUnion, and Germany. The agency's work includes providing protection, shelter,\nhealthcare and emergency relief, assisting in resettlement and repatriation,\nand advocating for national and multilateral policies on behalf of refugees.\n\nIn recognition of its work, UNHCR has won two Nobel Peace Prizes, in 1954 and\n1981, and a Prince of Asturias Awards for International Cooperation in 1991.\nIt is a member of the United Nations Development Group, a consortium of\norganizations dedicated to sustainable development."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees\n\nFollowing the demise of the League of Nations and the creation of the United\nNations the international community was acutely aware of the refugee crisis\nfollowing the end of World War II. In 1947, the International Refugee\nOrganization (IRO) was founded by the United Nations. The IRO was the first\ninternational agency to deal comprehensively with all aspects of refugees'\nlives. Preceding this was the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation\nAdministration, which was established in 1944 to address the millions of\npeople displaced across Europe as a result of World War II.\n\nIn the late 1940s, the IRO fell out of favour, but the UN agreed that a body\nwas required to oversee global refugee issues. Despite many heated debates in\nthe General Assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was\nfounded as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly by Resolution 319 (IV)\nof the United Nations General Assembly of December 1949. However, the\norganisation was only intended to operate for 3 years, from January 1951, due\nto the disagreement of many UN member states over the implications of a\npermanent body.\n\nUNHCR's mandate was originally set out in its statute, annexed to resolution\n428 (V) of the United Nations General Assembly of 1950. This mandate has been\nsubsequently broadened by numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and its\nEconomic and Social Council (ECOSOC). According to UNHCR, its mandate is to\nprovide, on a non-political and humanitarian basis, international protection\nto refugees and to seek permanent solutions for them.\n\nSoon after the signing of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of\nRefugees, it became clear that refugees were not solely restricted to Europe.\nIn 1956, UNHCR was involved in coordinating the response to the uprising in\nHungary. Just a year later, UNHCR was tasked with dealing with Chinese\nrefugees in Hong Kong, while also responding to Algerian refugees who had fled\nto Morocco and Tunisia in the wake of Algeria's war for independence. The\nresponses marked the beginning of a wider, global mandate in refugee\nprotection and humanitarian assistance.\n\nDecolonisation in the 1960s triggered large refugee movements in Africa,\ncreating a massive challenge that would transform UNHCR; unlike the refugee\ncrises in Europe, there were no durable solutions in Africa, and many refugees\nwho fled one country only found instability in their new country of refuge. By\nthe end of the decade, two-thirds of UNHCR's budget was focused on operations\nin Africa, and in just one decade, the organization's focus had shifted from\nan almost exclusive focus on Europe.\n\nIn 1967, the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees was ratified to\nremove the geographical and temporal restrictions of UNHCR under the 1951\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees. As the Convention was confined\nto the refugee crisis in the aftermath of World War II in Europe, the Protocol\nwas made to address the \"new refugee situations that have arisen since the\nConvention was adopted and the refugees concerned that may therefore not fall\nwithin the scope of the Convention\".\n\nIn the 1970s, UNHCR refugee operations continued to spread around the globe,\nwith the mass exodus of East Pakistanis to India shortly before the birth of\nBangladesh. Adding to the woes in Asia was the Vietnam War, with millions\nfleeing Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam. The 1980s saw new challenges for UNHCR,\nwith many member states unwilling to resettle refugees due to the sharp rise\nin refugee numbers over the 1970s. Often, these refugees were not fleeing wars\nbetween states, but inter-ethnic conflict in newly independent states. The\ntargeting of civilians as military strategy added to the displacement in many\nnations, so even \"minor\" conflicts could result in a large number of displaced\npersons. Whether in Asia, Central America or Africa, these conflicts, fueled\nby superpower rivalry and aggravated by socio-economic problems within the\nconcerned countries, durable solutions continued to prove a massive challenge\nfor the UNHCR. As a result, the UNHCR became more heavily involved with\nassistance programs within refugee camps, often located in hostile\nenvironments.\n\nThe end of the Cold War marked continued inter-ethnic conflict and contributed\nheavily to refugee flight. In addition, humanitarian intervention by\nmultinational forces became more frequent, and the media began to play a big\nrole, particularly in the lead up to the 1999 NATO mission in FR Yugoslavia,\nwhile by contrast, the 1994 Rwandan Genocide had little attention. The\ngenocide in Rwanda caused a massive refugee crisis, again highlighting the\ndifficulties for UNHCR to uphold its mandate, and the UNHCR continued to\nbattle against restrictive refugee policies in so-called \"rich\" nations.\n\nAccording to a 2021 study, the UNHCR has fulfilled its mandate to serve\nrefugees independent of their location consistently over time. The\norganization has shown limited bias towards donors in the geographical\ndistribution of its funds."

The agency is mandated to\nlead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees (other than\nPalestinian refugees, who are assisted by UNRWA) and resolve refugee problems\nworldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of\nrefugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to seek\nasylum and find safe refuge in another state, with the option to return home\nvoluntarily, integrate locally or to resettle in a third country.\n\nUNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and\nproviding humanitarian assistance to whom it describes as other persons \"of\nconcern\", including internally displaced persons (IDPs) who would fit the\nlegal definition of a refugee under the 1951 United Nations Convention\nRelating to the Status of Refugees and 1967 Protocol, the 1969 Organization\nfor African Unity Convention, or some other treaty if they left their country,\nbut who presently remain in their country of origin. UNHCR presently has major\nmissions in Lebanon, South Sudan, Chad/Darfur, Democratic Republic of Congo,\nIraq, Afghanistan, and Kenya to assist and provide services to IDPs and\nrefugees in camps and in urban settings.\n\nUNHCR maintains a database of refugee information, ProGres, which was created\nduring the Kosovo War in the 1990s. The database today contains data on over\n11 million refugees, or about 11% of all displaced persons globally. The\ndatabase contains biometric data, including fingerprints and iris scans and is\nused to determine aid distribution for recipients. The results of using\nbiometric verification have been successful. When introduced in Kenyan refugee\ncamps of Kakuma and Dadaab in the year 2013, the UN World Food Programme was\nable to eliminate $1.4M in waste and fraud.\n\nTo achieve its mandate, the UNHCR engages in activities both in the countries\nof interest and in countries with donors. This includes hosting \"expert\nroundtables\" to discuss issues of concern to the international refugee\ncommunity."

Stamp of Tajikistan, 2001.\n\nSeveral new programs have recently been introduced to support and to heighten\nawareness of the issues faced by refugees around the world. These two new\nprograms are a product of the benchmarks set out by the United Nations\nMillennium Development Goals.\n\nThe UNHCR works in different regions of the world to raise awareness about the\nrefugee crisis and the needs of these refugees.\n\nSince 2009, the UNHCR acknowledged a large presence of migration and refugees\nin the Caribbean, where the refugee crisis remained largely unreported. The\nissue stems from refugees who, instead of applying to the U.N., improperly\nsearch for asylum in the United States, ultimately failing to reach their\ndestination and remaining in the Caribbean. However, migrant laws in some of\nthese nations lacked any protections for asylum seekers, including the ability\nto be recognized as such. In response, the UNHCR organized talks with these\nnations in Costa Rica in 2009, seeking to address the lack of protections for\nrefugees and their prosecution as unauthorized migrants. A refugee seeker\napplies through the U.N. for placement, and an asylum seeker applies within\nthe Country in which asylum is sought. This is why some Countries label\nrefugees as illegal when they did not apply through the U.N. for placement and\nentered the country unlawfully.\n\nIn 2007, UNHCR offices in Canada launched an aggressive media campaign to shed\nlight on the plight of refugees. This campaign was meant to humanize the\nrefugee crisis by showing refugees living in the midst of disturbing\nconditions. Using emotional appeals to raise public awareness, the campaign\nhoped to increase the interest of particularly \"30 to 45-year-old\nprofessionals who are generally well educated, well-read, but have not had\ndirect experience or knowledge of refugee issues\", according to fund-raising\nofficer Jonathan Wade.\n\nIn Ireland, the UNHCR works to inform the public through different channels.\nThe UNHCR in Ireland actively pursues media relations. It also holds public\nevents with the aim of informing people about current refugee crises. One of\nthese is the annual UNHCR/SARI Fair play Football Cup.\n\nThe UNHCR was prominent in helping Syrian refugees in Lebanon. When the\nLebanese government was unable to withstand the influx of refugees, the UNHCR\nstepped in and eased the displacement for the refugees mainly by offering food\nand healthcare. They also helped register the refugees, so they would not be\nconsidered illegal in the eyes of the Lebanese government. Many Syrian\nrefugees are also in Jordan."

Specifically, the 20 draft principles focus on human rights;\nnon-discrimination; rescue and assistance; access to justice; border\ngovernance; returns; violence; detention; family unity; child migrants; women\nmigrants; right to health; adequate standard of living; decent work; right to\neducation; right to information; monitoring and accountability; migrants\u2019\nhuman rights defenders; data; and international cooperation. The declaration\nset off a process leading to the negotiation of the Global Compact for\nMigration.\n\nOn 28 September 2016, the UNHCR partnered with the UN Food and Agriculture\nOrganization in Tehran for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees.

Sometimes, this might have led the agency's bureaucratic\napparatus to adopt pathological behaviours.\n\nAn example of the latter, according to Barnett and Finnemore, was the handling\nof the 1995 Rohingyan crisis. At the time, thousands of Rohingyans were\nfleeing Burma (or Myanmar), seeking shelter in UNHCR camps in Bangladesh.\nAccording to some,[_who?_] UNHCR has been decisive in promoting the\nrepatriation of refugees, although Non-Governmental Organizations on the field\nand the UN were skeptical about better political and security conditions in\nBurma.\n\nAlso, controversies arose on the methods with which the UNHCR staff was\nconducting surveys in the camps to establish whether refugees were willing to\nmove back to Burma or not."
