        "generated_section_content_md": "Regional trade organization and free trade area\n\nThe **European Free Trade Association** (**EFTA**) is a regional trade\norganization and free trade area consisting of four European states: Iceland,\nLiechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The organization operates in parallel\nwith the European Union (EU), and all four member states participate in the\nEuropean single market and are part of the Schengen Area. They are not,\nhowever, party to the European Union Customs Union.\n\nEFTA was historically one of the two dominant western European trade blocs,\nbut is now much smaller and closely associated with its historical competitor,\nthe European Union. It was established on 3 May 1960 to serve as an\nalternative trade bloc for those European states that were unable or unwilling\nto join the then European Economic Community (EEC), the main predecessor of\nthe EU. The Stockholm Convention (1960), to establish the EFTA, was signed on\n4 January 1960 in the Swedish capital by seven countries (known as the \"Outer\nSeven\": Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and the United\nKingdom). A revised Convention, the Vaduz Convention, was signed on 21 June\n2001 and entered into force on 1 June 2002.\n\nAfter 1995 only two founding members remained, namely Norway and Switzerland.\nThe other five, Austria, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom, had\njoined the EU at some point in the intervening years. The initial Stockholm\nConvention was superseded by the Vaduz Convention, which aimed to provide a\nsuccessful framework for continuing the expansion and liberalization of trade,\nboth among the organization's member states and with the rest of the world.\n\nWhile the EFTA is not a customs union and member states have full rights to\nenter into bilateral third-country trade arrangements, it does have a\ncoordinated trade policy. As a result, its member states have jointly\nconcluded free trade agreements with the EU and a number of other countries.\nTo participate in the EU's single market, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway\nare parties to the Agreement on a European Economic Area (EEA), with\ncompliances regulated by the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court.\nSwitzerland has a set of multilateral agreements with the EU and its member\nstates instead.[_dubious \u2013 discuss_]"

This\nestablished the progressive elimination of customs duties on industrial\nproducts, but did not affect agricultural or fisheries products.\n\nThe main difference between the early EEC and the EFTA was that the latter did\nnot operate common external customs tariffs unlike the former: each EFTA\nmember was free to establish its individual customs duties against, or its\nindividual free trade agreements with, non-EFTA countries.\n\nThe founding members of the EFTA were: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal,\nSweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. During the 1960s, these countries\nwere often referred to as the \"Outer Seven\", as opposed to the Inner Six of\nthe then European Economic Community (EEC).\n\nFinland became an associate member in 1961 and a full member in 1986, and\nIceland joined in 1970. The United Kingdom and Denmark joined the EEC in 1973\nand hence ceased to be EFTA members. Portugal also left EFTA for the European\nCommunity in 1986. Liechtenstein joined the EFTA in 1991 (previously its\ninterests had been represented by Switzerland). Austria, Sweden, and Finland\njoined the EU in 1995 and thus ceased to be EFTA members.\n\nTwice, in 1972 and in 1994, the Norwegian government had tried to join the EU\n(still the EEC, in 1973) and by doing so, leave the EFTA. However, both the\ntimes, the membership of the EU was rejected in national referendums, keeping\nNorway in the EFTA. Iceland applied for EU membership in 2009 due to the\n2008\u20132011 Icelandic financial crisis, but has since dropped its bid."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In November 2012, after the Council of the European Union had called for an\nevaluation of the EU's relations with Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino, which\nthey described as \"fragmented\", the European Commission published a report\noutlining the options for their further integration into the EU. Unlike\nLiechtenstein, which is a member of the EEA via the EFTA and the Schengen\nAgreement, relations with these three states are based on a collection of\nagreements covering specific issues. The report examined four alternatives to\nthe current situation:\n\n1. A Sectoral Approach with separate agreements with each state covering an entire policy area.\n2. A comprehensive, multilateral Framework Association Agreement (FAA) with the three states.\n3. EEA membership, and\n4. EU membership.\n\nHowever, the Commission argued that the sectoral approach did not address the\nmajor issues and was still needlessly complicated, while EU membership was\ndismissed in the near future because \"the EU institutions are currently not\nadapted to the accession of such small-sized countries\". The remaining\noptions, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and\nwere recommended by the commission. In response, the Council requested that\nnegotiations with the three microstates on further integration continue, and\nthat a report be prepared by the end of 2013 detailing the implications of the\ntwo viable alternatives and recommendations on how to proceed.\n\nAs EEA membership is currently only open to EFTA or EU member states, the\nconsent of existing EFTA member states is required for the microstates to join\nthe EEA without becoming members of the EU. In 2011, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, then\nForeign Minister of Norway which is an EFTA member state, said that EFTA/EEA\nmembership for the microstates was not the appropriate mechanism for their\nintegration into the internal market due to their different requirements from\nthose of larger countries such as Norway, and suggested that a simplified\nassociation would be better suited for them. Espen Barth Eide, St\u00f8re's\nsuccessor, responded to the commission's report in late 2012 by questioning\nwhether the microstates have sufficient administrative capabilities to meet\nthe obligations of EEA membership. However, he stated that Norway would be\nopen to the possibility of EFTA membership for the microstates if they decided\nto submit an application, and that the country had not made a final decision\non the matter. Pascal Schafhauser, the Counsellor of the Liechtenstein Mission\nto the EU, said that Liechtenstein, another EFTA member state, was willing to\ndiscuss EEA membership for the microstates provided their joining did not\nimpede the functioning of the organization. However, he suggested that the\noption of direct membership in the EEA for the microstates, outside of both\nthe EFTA and the EU, should be considered. On 18 November 2013, the EU\nCommission concluded that \"the participation of the small-sized countries in\nthe EEA is not judged to be a viable option at present due to the political\nand institutional reasons\", and that Association Agreements were a more\nfeasible mechanism to integrate the microstates into the internal market."

In mid-2005, representatives of the\nFaroe Islands raised the possibility of their territory re-joining the EFTA.\nBecause Article 56 of the EFTA Convention only allows sovereign states to\nbecome members of the EFTA, the Faroes considered the possibility that the\n\"Kingdom of Denmark in respect of the Faroes\" could join the EFTA on their\nbehalf. The Danish Government has stated that this mechanism would not allow\nthe Faroes to become a member of the EEA because Denmark was already a party\nto the EEA Agreement.\n\nThe Faroes already have an extensive bilateral free trade agreement with\nIceland, known as the Hoyv\u00edk Agreement."

The country held a referendum in\n2016 on withdrawing from the EU (popularly referred to as \"Brexit\"), resulting\nin a 51.9% vote in favour of withdrawing. A 2013 research paper presented to\nthe Parliament of the United Kingdom proposed a number of alternatives to EU\nmembership which would continue to allow it access to the EU's internal\nmarket, including continuing EEA membership as an EFTA member state, or the\nSwiss model of a number of bilateral treaties covering the provisions of the\nsingle market.\n\nIn the first meeting since the Brexit vote, EFTA reacted by saying both that\nthey were open to a UK return, and that Britain has many issues to work\nthrough. The president of Switzerland Johann Schneider-Ammann stated that its\nreturn would strengthen the association. However, in August 2016 the Norwegian\nGovernment expressed reservations. Norway's European affairs minister,\nElisabeth Vik Aspaker, told the _Aftenposten_ newspaper: \"It's not certain\nthat it would be a good idea to let a big country into this organization. It\nwould shift the balance, which is not necessarily in Norway's interests.\"\n\nIn late 2016, the Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that her\npriority was to keep the whole of the UK in the European single market but\nthat taking Scotland alone into the EEA was an option being \"looked at\".\nHowever, other EFTA states have stated that only sovereign states are eligible\nfor membership, so it could only join if it became independent from the UK,\nunless the solution scouted for the Faroes in 2005 were to be adopted (see\nabove).\n\nIn early 2018, British MPs Antoinette Sandbach, Stephen Kinnock and Stephen\nHammond called for the UK to rejoin EFTA."

EFTA nationals and EU\ncitizens are not only visa-exempt but are legally entitled to enter and reside\nin each other's countries. The **Citizens' Rights Directive** (also sometimes\ncalled the \"Free Movement Directive\") defines the right of free movement for\ncitizens of the European Economic Area (EEA), which includes the three EFTA\nmembers Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein plus the member states of the EU.\nSwitzerland, which is a member of EFTA but not of the EEA, is not bound by the\nDirective but rather has a separate multilateral agreement on free movement\nwith the EU and its member states.\n\nAs a result, a citizen of an EFTA country can live and work in all the other\nEFTA countries and in all the EU countries, and a citizen of an EU country can\nlive and work in all the EFTA countries (but for voting and working in\nsensitive fields, such as government / police / military, citizenship is often\nrequired, and non-citizens may not have the same rights to welfare and\nunemployment benefits as citizens)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Portugal Fund came into operation in February 1977 when Portugal was still\na member of EFTA. It was to provide funding for the development of Portugal\nafter the Carnation Revolution and the consequential restoration of democracy\nand the decolonization of the country's overseas possessions. This followed a\nperiod of economic sanctions by most of the international community, which\nleft Portugal economically underdeveloped compared to the rest of the western\nEurope. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985 in order to join the EEC, the\nremaining EFTA members decided to continue the Portugal Fund so that Portugal\nwould continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-\ninterest loan from the EFTA member states to the value of US$100 million.\nRepayment was originally to commence in 1988, however, EFTA then decided to\npostpone the start of repayments until 1998. The Portugal Fund was dissolved\nin January 2002."
