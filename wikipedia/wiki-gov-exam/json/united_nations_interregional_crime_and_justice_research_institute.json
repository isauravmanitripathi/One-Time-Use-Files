        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1965, the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) outlined in\nResolution 1086 B (XXXIX) the organisational arrangements for a United Nations\nSocial Defence Programme. In 1967, UN Secretary-General U Thant issued\nBulletin ST/SGB/134, which established the United Nations Social Defence\nResearch Institute (UNSDRI), mandated to develop \"new knowledge and the\napplication thereof in advancing policy and practice in the prevention and\ncontrol of both juvenile delinquency and adult criminality\" through research\nand technical support. The United Nations and the Italian Government signed an\nagreement in 1968 for the establishment of UNSDRI's Headquarters in Rome and\nthe institute was formally inaugurated the following year by the UN Secretary-\nGeneral.\n\nUnder ECOSOC Resolution No. 1989/56, the institute was renamed the United\nNations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) in 1989.\nIts mandate was enlarged through the adoption of its present statute. UNICRI\nmoved its headquarters from Rome to Turin in 2000.\n\nSince 2000, UNICRI has set up liaison offices in Brussels and Geneva. It\nestablished the AI Centre for Advanced Robotics in The Hague in 2017, as well\nas Centres of Excellence on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear\nrisk mitigation in Algiers, Amman, Manila, Nairobi, Rabat, Tashkent and\nTbilisi in partnership with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre."

UNICRI works in specialized niches and selected areas within the\nfields of crime prevention, justice, security governance and the risks and\nbenefits of technological advances. UNICRI provides a vital foundation for\nUnited Nations policy and operations through its specialized training and\ncapacity-building programmes. The Institute serves as a conduit for\nchannelling innovative ideas from within and outside the United Nations\nsystem.\n\nThrough its research, needs assessments and analyses of evolving trends, as\nwell as the feedback received from partners, academics, civil society actors,\npolicymakers and practitioners, UNICRI has identified the following threats\nand challenges in its Strategic Programme Framework for the period 2019\u20132022:\n\n* **Radicalization and violent extremism:** the lack of context-specific responses, weak criminal justice systems, and gaps in national and transnational cooperation;\n* **Transnational organized crime involvement in licit and illicit markets:** shadow economies, illicit financial flows and possible links with terrorist networks;\n* Weak security governance, poor rule of law and lack of accountability of institutions in post-conflict areas;\n* **High-tech security:** encompassing global threats and solutions;\n* Threats to crowded spaces and vulnerable targets;\n* Vulnerabilities to criminal exploitation, gender inequalities and human rights violations against vulnerable populations;\n* **Emerging trends in crimes having an impact on the environment:** illegal extraction, use of and trade in environmental resources and trafficking in hazardous substances.\n\nThe Framework contains the following six strategic priorities:\n\n1. Preventing and countering violent extremism;\n2. Countering organized crime and fighting all forms of trafficking and illicit financial flows;\n3. Reinforcing the rule of law in post-conflict countries;\n4. Security through research, technology and innovation;\n5. Threat response and risk mitigation: security governance;\n6. Preventing crime through the protection and empowerment of vulnerable groups.\n\nThe responses to the criminal justice, security and governance issues\nhighlighted in the Framework have been carefully crafted to support and\ncontribute to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The\npriorities of the Institute are aligned in particular with Goal 16 (To promote\npeaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access\nto justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions\nat all levels), but they are also linked to several other Goals (2\u20136, 8, 9,\n11, 14 and 15)."
