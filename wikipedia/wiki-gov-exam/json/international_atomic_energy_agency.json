        "generated_section_content_md": "International organization\n\nThe **International Atomic Energy Agency** (**IAEA**) is an intergovernmental\norganization that seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to\ninhibit its use for any military purpose, including nuclear weapons. It was\nestablished in 1957 as an autonomous international organization; though\ngoverned by its own founding treaty, the IAEA Statute, the organization\nreports to both the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United\nNations, and is headquartered at the UN Office at Vienna, Austria.\n\nThe IAEA was created in response to growing international concern toward\nnuclear weapons, especially amid rising tensions between the foremost nuclear\npowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. U.S. president Dwight D.\nEisenhower's \"Atoms for Peace\" speech, which called for the creation of an\ninternational organization to monitor the global proliferation of nuclear\nresources and technology, is credited with catalyzing the formation of the\nIAEA, whose Statute came into force on 29 July 1957.\n\nThe IAEA serves as an intergovernmental forum for scientific and technical\ncooperation on the peaceful use of nuclear technology and nuclear power\nworldwide. It maintains several programs that encourage the development of\npeaceful applications of nuclear energy, science, and technology; provide\ninternational safeguards against misuse of nuclear technology and nuclear\nmaterials; and promote and implement nuclear safety (including radiation\nprotection) and nuclear security standards. The organization also conducts\nresearch in nuclear science and provides technical support and training in\nnuclear technology to countries worldwide, particularly in the developing\nworld.\n\nFollowing the ratification of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear\nWeapons in 1968, all non-nuclear powers are required to negotiate a safeguards\nagreement with the IAEA, which is given the authority to monitor nuclear\nprograms and to inspect nuclear facilities. In 2005, the IAEA and its\nadministrative head, Director General Mohamed ElBaradei, were awarded the\nNobel Peace Prize \"for their efforts to prevent nuclear energy from being used\nfor military purposes and to ensure that nuclear energy for peaceful purposes\nis used in the safest possible way\"."

The Department of Nuclear Energy focuses on\nproviding advice and services to Member States on nuclear power and the\nnuclear fuel cycle. The Department of Nuclear Sciences and Applications\nfocuses on the use of non-power nuclear and isotope techniques to help IAEA\nMember States in the areas of water, energy, health, biodiversity, and\nagriculture. The Department of Technical Cooperation provides direct\nassistance to IAEA Member States, through national, regional, and inter-\nregional projects through training, expert missions, scientific exchanges, and\nprovision of equipment."

Its resources are used on the other two\npriorities: technical co-operation and preventing nuclear weapons\nproliferation.\n\nThe IAEA itself says that, beginning in 1986, in response to the nuclear\nreactor explosion and disaster near Chernobyl, Ukraine, the IAEA redoubled its\nefforts in the field of nuclear safety. The IAEA says that the same happened\nafter the Fukushima disaster in Fukushima, Japan.\n\nIn June 2011, the IAEA Director General said he had \"broad support for his\nplan to strengthen international safety checks on nuclear power plants to help\navoid any repeat of Japan's Fukushima crisis\". Peer-reviewed safety checks on\nreactors worldwide, organized by the IAEA, have been proposed."

In 1953, U.S. President Dwight D.\nEisenhower proposed the creation of an international body to both regulate and\npromote the peaceful use of atomic power (nuclear power), in his Atoms for\nPeace address to the UN General Assembly. In September 1954, the United States\nproposed to the General Assembly the creation of an international agency to\ntake control of fissile material, which could be used either for nuclear power\nor for nuclear weapons. This agency would establish a kind of \"nuclear bank\".\n\nThe United States also called for an international scientific conference on\nall of the peaceful aspects of nuclear power. By November 1954, it had become\nclear that the Soviet Union would reject any international custody of fissile\nmaterial if the United States did not agree to disarmament first, but that a\n_clearinghouse_ for nuclear transactions might be possible. From 8 to 20\nAugust 1955, the United Nations held the International Conference on the\nPeaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland. In October 1957, a\nConference on the IAEA Statute was held at the Headquarters of the United\nNations to approve the founding document for the IAEA, which was negotiated in\n1955\u20131957 by a group of twelve countries. The Statute of the IAEA was approved\non 23 October 1956 and came into force on 29 July 1957.\n\nFormer US Congressman W. Sterling Cole served as the IAEA's first Director-\nGeneral from 1957 to 1961. Cole served only one term, after which the IAEA was\nheaded by two Swedes for nearly four decades: the scientist Sigvard Eklund\nheld the job from 1961 to 1981, followed by former Swedish Foreign Minister\nHans Blix, who served from 1981 to 1997. Blix was succeeded as Director\nGeneral by Mohamed ElBaradei of Egypt, who served until November 2009.\n\nBeginning in 1986, in response to the nuclear reactor explosion and disaster\nnear Chernobyl, Ukraine, the IAEA increased its efforts in the field of\nnuclear safety. The same happened after the 2011 Fukushima disaster in\nFukushima, Japan.\n\nBoth the IAEA and its then Director General, ElBaradei, were awarded the Nobel\nPeace Prize in 2005. In his acceptance speech in Oslo, ElBaradei stated that\nonly one percent of the money spent on developing new weapons would be enough\nto feed the entire world, and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction,\nthen nuclear weapons should have no place in our collective conscience, and no\nrole in our security.\n\nOn 2 July 2009, Yukiya Amano of Japan was elected as the Director General for\nthe IAEA, defeating Abdul Samad Minty of South Africa and Luis E. Ech\u00e1varri of\nSpain. On 3 July 2009, the Board of Governors voted to appoint Yukiya Amano\n\"by acclamation\", and IAEA General Conference in September 2009 approved. He\ntook office on 1 December 2009. After Amano's death, his Chief of Coordination\nCornel Feruta of Romania was named Acting Director General.\n\nOn 2 August 2019, Rafael Grossi was presented as the Argentine candidate to\nbecome the Director General of IAEA. On 28 October 2019, the IAEA Board of\nGovernors held its first vote to elect the new Director General, but none of\nthe candidates secured the two-thirds majority (23 votes) in the 35-member\nIAEA Board of Governors that was needed to be elected. The next day, 29\nOctober, the second voting round was held, and Grossi won 24 votes. He assumed\noffice on 3 December 2019. Following a special meeting of the IAEA General\nConference to approve his appointment, on 3 December Grossi became the first\nLatin American to head the Agency.\n\nDuring the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Grossi visited Ukraine multiple times\nas part of the ongoing efforts to help prevent a nuclear accident during the\nwar. He warned against any complacency towards the dangers that the\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, Europe's largest nuclear power plant, was\nfacing. IAEA experts are stationed at the plant, and the teams are regularly\nrotated in and out. During one such rotation, an IAEA car was attacked by a\ndrone. Also the plant has come under fire multiple times during the war."

Unlike most other specialized international agencies, the IAEA does\nmuch of its work with the Security Council, and not with the United Nations\nEconomic and Social Council. The structure and functions of the IAEA are\ndefined by its founding document, the IAEA Statute (see below). The IAEA has\nthree main bodies: the Board of Governors, the General Conference, and the\nSecretariat.\n\nThe IAEA exists to pursue the \"safe, secure and peaceful uses of nuclear\nsciences and technology\" (Pillars 2005). The IAEA executes this mission with\nthree main functions: the inspection of existing nuclear facilities to ensure\ntheir peaceful use, providing information and developing standards to ensure\nthe safety and security of nuclear facilities, and as a hub for the various\nfields of science involved in the peaceful applications of nuclear technology.\n\nThe IAEA recognizes knowledge as the nuclear energy industry's most valuable\nasset and resource, without which the industry cannot operate safely and\neconomically. Following the IAEA General Conference since 2002 resolutions the\nNuclear Knowledge Management, a formal program was established to address\nMember States' priorities in the 21st century.\n\nIn 2004, the IAEA developed a Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy (PACT).\nPACT responds to the needs of developing countries to establish, to improve,\nor to expand radiotherapy treatment programs. The IAEA is raising money to\nhelp efforts by its Member States to save lives and reduce the suffering of\ncancer victims.\n\nThe IAEA has established programs to help developing countries in planning to\nbuild systematically the capability to manage a nuclear power program,\nincluding the Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Group, which has carried out\nIntegrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review missions in Indonesia, Jordan,\nThailand and Vietnam. The IAEA reports that roughly 60 countries are\nconsidering how to include nuclear power in their energy plans.\n\nTo enhance the sharing of information and experience among IAEA Member States\nconcerning the seismic safety of nuclear facilities, in 2008 the IAEA\nestablished the International Seismic Safety Centre. This centre is\nestablishing safety standards and providing for their application in relation\nto site selection, site evaluation and seismic design.\n\nThe IAEA has its headquarters since its founding in Vienna, Austria. The IAEA\nhas two \"Regional Safeguards Offices\" which are located in Toronto, Canada,\nand in Tokyo, Japan. The IAEA also has two liaison offices which are located\nin New York City, United States, and in Geneva, Switzerland. In addition, the\nIAEA has laboratories and research centers located in Seibersdorf, Austria, in\nMonaco and in Trieste, Italy."

He has accused the IAEA and corporations of \"wilfully\nignoring lessons from the world's worst nuclear accident 25 years ago to\nprotect the industry's expansion\". The IAEA's role \"as an advocate for nuclear\npower has made it a target for protests\".\n\nThe journal _Nature_ has reported that the IAEA response to the 2011 Fukushima\nDaiichi nuclear disaster in Japan was \"sluggish and sometimes confusing\",\ndrawing calls for the agency to \"take a more proactive role in nuclear\nsafety\". But nuclear experts say that the agency's complicated mandate and the\nconstraints imposed by its member states mean that reforms will not happen\nquickly or easily, although its INES \"emergency scale is very likely to be\nrevisited\" given the confusing way in which it was used in Japan.\n\nSome scientists say that the Fukushima nuclear accidents have revealed that\nthe nuclear industry lacks sufficient oversight, leading to renewed calls to\nredefine the mandate of the IAEA so that it can better police nuclear power\nplants worldwide. There are several problems with the IAEA says Najmedin\nMeshkati of University of Southern California:\n\n> It recommends safety standards, but member states are not required to\n> comply; it promotes nuclear energy, but it also monitors nuclear use; it is\n> the sole global organisation overseeing the nuclear energy industry, yet it\n> is also weighed down by checking compliance with the Nuclear Non-\n> Proliferation Treaty (NPT).\n\nIn 2011, an editorial by _Nature_ opined that the International Atomic Energy\nAgency should be strengthened to make independent assessments of nuclear\nsafety and that \"the public would be better served by an IAEA more able to\ndeliver frank and independent assessments of nuclear crises as they unfold\"."
