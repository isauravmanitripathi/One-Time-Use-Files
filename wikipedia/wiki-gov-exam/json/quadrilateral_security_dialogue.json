The grouping follows the\n\"Tsunami Core Group\" and its \"new type of diplomacy\" developed in response to\nthe 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. It was initiated in 2007 by\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, with the support of Australian prime\nminister John Howard, Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh and U.S. vice\npresident Dick Cheney.[_failed verification_] The dialogue was paralleled by\njoint military exercises of an unprecedented scale, titled Exercise Malabar.\nThe diplomatic and military arrangement was widely viewed as a response to\nincreased Chinese economic and military power.\n\nThe partnership is known formally as the \"Quad,\" not the \"Quadrilateral\nSecurity Dialogue,\" noting its nature as a diplomatic, not security,\npartnership. The \"Quadrilateral Security Dialogue\" is a misnomer not used\nofficially by the Quad governments.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe Quad ceased in 2008 following the withdrawal of Australia during Kevin\nRudd's tenure as prime minister, reflecting ambivalence in Australian policy\nover the growing tension between the United States and China in the Indo-\nPacific. Following Rudd's replacement by Julia Gillard in 2010, enhanced\nmilitary cooperation between the United States and Australia was resumed,\nleading to the placement of U.S. Marines near Darwin, overlooking the Timor\nSea and Lombok Strait. Meanwhile, India, Japan, and the United States\ncontinued to hold joint naval exercises under Malabar.[_citation needed_]\n\nDuring the 2017 ASEAN Summits in Manila, all four former members led by Abe,\nAustralian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, Indian prime minister Narendra\nModi, and U.S. president Donald Trump agreed to revive the Quad partnership in\norder to counter China militarily and diplomatically in the Indo-Pacific\nregion, particularly in the South China Sea. Tensions between Quad members and\nChina have led to fears of what was dubbed by some commentators \"a new Cold\nWar\" in the region, and the Chinese government responded to the Quad dialogue\nby issuing formal diplomatic protests to its members, calling it \"Asian NATO\".\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brazil, Israel, New Zealand, South Korea, and\nVietnam were invited to \"Quad Plus\" meetings to discuss their responses to it."

The Quad was supposed to establish an\n\"Asian Arc of Democracy\", envisioned to ultimately include countries in\nCentral Asia, Mongolia, the Korean Peninsula, and other countries in Southeast\nAsia: \"virtually all the countries on China\u2019s periphery, except for China\nitself.\" This led some critics, such as former U.S. State Department official\nMorton Abramowitz, to call the project \"an anti-Chinese move\", while others\nhave called it a \"democratic challenge\" to the projected Chinese century,\nmounted by Asian powers in coordination with the United States. While China\nhas traditionally favoured the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Quad was\nviewed as an \"Asian NATO;\" Daniel Twining of the German Marshall Fund of the\nUnited States has written that the arrangement \"could lead to military\nconflict,\" or could instead \"lay an enduring foundation for peace\" if China\nbecomes a democratic leader in Asia."

In May 2007 in Manila, Australian Prime\nMinister John Howard participated with other members in the inaugural meeting\nof the Quad at Cheney's urging, one month after joint naval exercises near\nTokyo by India, Japan and the United States. In September 2007 further naval\nexercises were held in the Bay of Bengal, including Australia. These were\nfollowed in October by a further security agreement between Japan and India,\nratified during a visit by Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Tokyo, to\npromote sea lane safety and defence collaboration; Japan had previously\nestablished such an agreement only with Australia.\n\nThough the Quadrilateral initiative of the Bush administration improved\nrelationships with New Delhi, it gave the impression of \"encircling\" China.\nThe security agreement between Japan and India furthermore made China\nconspicuous as absent on the list of Japan's strategic partners in Asia. These\nmoves appeared to \"institutionally alienate\" China, the Association of South-\nEast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and promote a \"Washington-centric\" ring of\nalliances in Asia.\n\nThe Japanese Prime Minister succeeding Abe, Taro Aso, downplayed the\nimportance of China in the Japan-India pact signed following the creation of\nthe Quad, stating, \"There was mention of China \u2013 and we do not have any\nassumption of a third country as a target such as China.\" Indian Foreign\nSecretary Shiv Shankar Menon similarly argued that the defence agreement was\nlong overdue because of Indian freight trade with Japan, and did not\nspecifically target China.

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 2008 Kevin Rudd terminated the Quad, signaling closer relations with China.\n\nFears over Chinese military spending and missile capacities had helped drive\nAustralia towards a defence agreement with the United States, as outlined by\nthe 2007 Canberra Defense Blueprint; Sandy Gordon of the Australian Strategic\nPolicy Institute had recommended the sale of uranium to India on the basis of\nsimilar considerations, as it appeared that the United States was backing it\nas a \"counter to a rising China.\" Chinese anger over the Quad however caused\nuneasiness within Australia even before the agreements were initiated.\n\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd visited China's foreign minister, Yang\nJiechi, even before visiting Japan, and subsequently organized a meeting\nbetween Yang and the Australian foreign minister, Stephen Smith, in which\nAustralia unilaterally announced it would \"not be proposing\" a second round of\ndialogue between the four partners. Within Australia, this decision was seen\nas motivated by the uncertainty of China-United States relations and by the\nfact that Australia's principal economic partner, China, was not its principal\nstrategic partner. Rudd may furthermore have feared regional escalations in\nconflict and attempted to diffuse these via an \"Asia-Pacific Union.\"\n\nSome US strategic thinkers criticized Rudd's decision to leave Quad; the\nformer Asia director of the United States National Security Council, Mike\nGreen, said that Rudd had withdrawn in an effort to please China, which had\nexerted substantial diplomatic effort to achieve that aim. A December 2008\nleaked diplomatic cable authored by US ambassador Robert McCallum reveals that\nRudd did not consult the United States before leaving the Quad.\n\nThe Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, a region claimed by China to be part of\nTibet.\n\nUS President Obama's efforts in November 2009 to improve US\u2013Indian relations\nraised alarms in India and Australia both that a deepening military alliance\nbetween these powers could lead to regional escalations. According to analyst\nJohn Lee, \"For realists ... New Delhi has been warily balancing and competing\nagainst Beijing from the very moment of India's creation in 1947;\" significant\ntensions between China and India were associated with the disputed Indian\nprovince of Arunachal Pradesh, and with Chinese nuclear weapons stationed on\nthe Tibetan Plateau. Rudd's calculation may have been that as a regional\neconomic power, China was too important to contain through a simplistic\nQuadrilateral Initiative undertaken by US, India, Japan and Australia in 2007,\nwhen many regional powers are hedging their alliances in the event of a\nJapanese and an American decline."

Xi has taken a hard-line on\nsecurity issues as well as foreign affairs, projecting a more nationalistic\nand assertive China on the world stage than was the case with China's peaceful\nrise policy advanced by Xi's predecessor Hu Jintao. Xi's political program\ncalls for a China more united and confident of its own value system and\npolitical structure.\n\nUnder Xi's leadership, the PRC has resorted to island building in the Spratly\nIslands and the Paracel Islands region. According to Reuters, island building\nin the South China Sea primarily by Vietnam and the Philippines has been going\non for decades; while China has come late to the island building game, its\nefforts have been on an unprecedented scale as it had from 2014 to 2016\nconstructed more new island surface than all other nations have constructed\nthroughout history and as of 2016 placed military equipment on one of its\nartificial islands unlike the other claimants. A 2019 article in Voice of\nAmerica that compared China and Vietnam's island building campaign in the\nSouth China Sea similarly noted that the reason why Vietnam in\ncontradistinction to China has been subject to little international criticism\nand even support was because of the slower speed and widely perceived\ndefensive nature of its island-building project.\n\nIn a 2020 opinion column, former Indian general S.
