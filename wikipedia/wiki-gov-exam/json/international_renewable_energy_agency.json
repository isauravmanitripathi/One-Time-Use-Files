It\nwas founded in 2009, and its statute entered into force on 8 July 2010. The\nagency is headquartered in Masdar City, Abu Dhabi. The Director-General of\nIRENA is Francesco La Camera, a national of Italy. IRENA is an official United\nNations observer."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The first suggestions for an international renewable agency are based on the\n1980 Brandt Report activities. NGOs and industry lobbying groups like\nEurosolar, the World Council for Renewable Energy (WCRE) and the World Wind\nEnergy Association (WWEA) have promoted IRENA for several decades. In 1990,\nthe Austrian government of Franz Vranitzky suggested a renewables agency to\nthe UN. One of the drivers was Hermann Scheer, a German politician and\nlobbyist who was acting as president of EUROSOLAR and chair of WCRE.\n\nOn 15 June, at their annual event, the WWEA gave their 2010 World Wind Energy\nAward to the Founding member States of IRENA. They stated: \"The creation of\nIRENA can be seen as the most important decision ever taken on the global\nlevel in favour of renewable energy. The founding of IRENA sent out a very\nstrong signal to the world community that renewable energy will have to play\nand will play a key role in the future energy supply all over the world. With\nthe Award, WWEA would also like to indicate that WWEA is committed to work\nclosely with IRENA and will continue to give its full support.\"\n\nSince 1981, several meetings took place to discuss the formation of IRENA. The\nPreparatory Conference for founding IREA was held on 10 and 11 April 2008 with\n54 countries participating. Here, government representatives discussed the\nobjectives, activities, finances, and organizational structure of IRENA.\nParticipants expressed a need to begin a swift transition to a more secure,\nsustainable renewable energy economy with the assistance of an international\nbody.\n\nThe Founding Conference of the International Renewable Energy Agency was held\nin Bonn, Germany, on 26 January 2009. 75 countries signed the Agency's\nstatute. The statute entered into force on 8 July 2010, 30 days after the 25th\ncountry deposited its instrument of ratification. The Founding Conference\nestablished the Preparatory Commission for IRENA, which consists of all\nsignatory states.[_citation needed_]\n\nDuring the first session of the Preparatory Commission in Bonn on 27 January\n2009, the signatory countries adopted criteria and procedures for selecting\nIRENA's Interim Director-General and its interim headquarters. An\nAdministrative Committee was created to assist the commission in preparing its\nsecond session. The Administrative Committee prepared draft proposals for an\ninterim work programme and budget as well as for interim staff regulations and\ninterim financial rules. Nominations for the Interim Director-General and the\ninterim headquarters were submitted by 30 April 2009.\n\nThe second session of the Preparatory Commission met in Sharm el-Sheikh,\nEgypt, on 29\u201330 June 2009, to elect the Interim Director General and decide\nthe location of IRENA's interim headquarters. It was decided that the interim\nheadquarters will be located in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. In addition,\nan innovation and technology center will be located in Bonn, and an office\ndedicated to liaising with the United Nations and other international\ninstitutions will be located in Vienna. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pelosse was elected as the\nInterim Director-General. The second session of the Preparatory Commission\nalso adopted an interim work programme and budget as well as interim staff\nregulations and interim financial rules.\n\nThe fourth session of the Preparatory Commission on 24\u201325 October 2010 in Abu\nDhabi appointed Kenyan representative Adnan Amin, Deputy Interim Director-\nGeneral, to perform functions of Interim Director-General after resignation of\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pelosse. On 4 April 2011, Adnan Amin was sworn in as the first\nDirector-General.\n\nThe agency has staged a number of events bringing together member states for\ninteraction on ways and means of furthering renewable energy, and conducted\nsignificant research and development into viable solutions for the future. On\n8 September 2014, IRENA published a notable report on its works titled\n_REthinking energy_ , which encouraged \"speedier adoption of renewable energy\ntechnologies,\" as \"the most feasible route to reduce carbon emissions and\navoid catastrophic climate change.\" The study set out to gauge the global\npower sector and establish how technological advances, economic growth and\nclimate change are transforming it. \"A convergence of social, economic and\nenvironmental forces are transforming the global energy system as we know it.\nBut if we continue on the path we are currently on and fuel our growing\neconomies with outmoded ways of thinking and acting, we will not be able to\navoid the most serious impacts of climate change,\" Amin said at a function to\nrelease the report.\n\nThe Ninth Meeting of International Renewable Energy Agency Council was held on\n10\u201311 June 2015 at Abu Dhabi."
