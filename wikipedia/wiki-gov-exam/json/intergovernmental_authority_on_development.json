        "generated_section_content_md": "The Intergovernmental Authority on Development was established in 1996. It\nsucceeded the earlier Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development\n(IGADD), a multinational body founded in 1986 by Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia,\nSudan, Uganda and Kenya, with a focus on development and environmental\ncontrol. IGADD's headquarters were later moved to Djibouti, following an\nagreement signed in January 1986 by the member states. Eritrea joined the\norganization in 1993, upon achieving independence.\n\nIn April 1995, the Assembly of Heads of State and Government met in Addis\nAbaba, where they agreed to strengthen cooperation through the organization.\nThis was followed with the signing of a Letter of Instrument to Amend the\nIGADD Charter / Agreement on 21 March 1996. The Revitalised IGAD, a new\norganizational structure, was eventually launched on 25 November 1996 in\nDjibouti."
