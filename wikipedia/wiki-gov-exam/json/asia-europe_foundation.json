Founded in 1997, it is the only institution\nof the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). Its purpose is to promote mutual\nunderstanding and cooperation between the people of Asia and Europe through\nintellectual, cultural, and people-to-people exchanges.\n\nEvery year, ASEF runs about 20 projects in Asia and Europe together with over\n100 partner organisations, mainly conferences, seminars and workshops. More\nthan 1,000 Asians and Europeans actively participate in its activities\nannually and it reaches much wider audiences through its networks, web-\nportals, publications, lectures and exhibitions."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In March 1996, the leaders of 25 Asian and European countries as well as the\nEuropean Commission, met in Bangkok, Thailand, for the 1st Asia-Europe Meeting\n(ASEM) Summit (ASEM1). At this inaugural meeting, they agreed on the\nestablishment of the Asia\u2013Europe Foundation (ASEF) on 15 February 1997 as a\ncentral institution of ASEM's social, cultural and educational pillar. The\nmain tasks of ASEF are to bring the civil societies of Asia and Europe\ntogether and to become an interface between civil society and governments by\nfacilitating interactions among people from diverse fields and transmitting\nthe resulting outputs as recommendations to policy-makers.\n\nBy nature, ASEF is different from other organisations, as it works with both\nthe civil societies and public sectors of the ASEM Partners as well as the\nprivate sector. It works on creating sustainable networks and it injects civil\nsociety inputs into the ASEM Process, enhancing the ASEM Process. This unique\nattribute allows ASEF's activities to generate ideas and solutions that would\nnot normally emerge from pure civil society or inter-governmental processes.\n\nTo date, ASEF is the only permanently established institution of the ASEM\nProcess."
