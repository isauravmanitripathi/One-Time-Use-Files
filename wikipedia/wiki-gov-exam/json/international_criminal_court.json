        "generated_section_content_md": "Intergovernmental organization and international tribunal\n\nThe **International Criminal Court** (**ICC**) is an intergovernmental\norganization and international tribunal seated in The Hague, Netherlands.\nEstablished in 2002 under the multilateral Rome Statute, the ICC is the first\nand only permanent international court with jurisdiction to prosecute\nindividuals for the international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity,\nwar crimes, and the crime of aggression. The ICC is intended to complement,\nnot replace, national judicial systems; it can exercise its jurisdiction only\nwhen national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. It is\ndistinct from the International Court of Justice, an organ of the United\nNations that hears disputes between states.\n\nThe ICC can generally exercise jurisdiction in cases where the accused is a\nnational of a state party, the alleged crime took place on the territory of a\nstate party, or a situation is referred to the Court by the United Nations\nSecurity Council. As of October 2024, there are 125 states parties to the Rome\nStatute, which are represented in the court's governing body, the Assembly of\nStates Parties. A number of countries, including China, India, Russia, and the\nUnited States, are not party to the Rome Statute and do not recognise the\ncourt's jurisdiction.\n\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has opened investigations into over a dozen\nsituations and conducted numerous preliminary examinations. Dozens of\nindividuals have been indicted, including heads of state and other senior\nofficials. The court issued its first conviction in 2012 against Congolese\nwarlord Thomas Lubanga Dyilo for the war crime of using child soldiers. In\nrecent years, the court has issued arrest warrants for Russian president\nVladimir Putin in connection with the invasion of Ukraine, and for Israeli\nprime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and defense minister Yoav Gallant, along\nwith several Hamas leaders, in connection with the Gaza war.\n\nSince its establishment, the ICC has faced significant criticism. Opponents,\nincluding major powers that have not joined the court, question its\nlegitimacy, citing concerns over national sovereignty and accusing it of being\nsusceptible to political influence. The court has also been accused of bias\nand of disproportionately targeting leaders in Africa, which prompted several\nAfrican nations to threaten or initiate withdrawal from the statute in the\n2010s. Others have questioned the court's effectiveness, pointing to its\nreliance on state cooperation for arrests, its relatively small number of\nconvictions, and the high cost of its proceedings."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The establishment of an international tribunal to judge political leaders\naccused of international crimes was first proposed during the Paris Peace\nConference in 1919 following the First World War by the Commission of\nResponsibilities. The issue was addressed again at a conference held in Geneva\nunder the auspices of the League of Nations in 1937, which resulted in the\nconclusion of the first convention stipulating the establishment of a\npermanent international court to try acts of international terrorism. The\nconvention was signed by 13 states, but none ratified it and the convention\nnever entered into force.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, the allied powers established two _ad hoc_\ntribunals to prosecute Axis leaders accused of war crimes. The International\nMilitary Tribunal, which sat in Nuremberg and is often referred to as the\n\"Nuremberg Trials,\" prosecuted German leaders, including for Nazi perpetration\nof The Holocaust, while the International Military Tribunal for the Far East\nin Tokyo prosecuted Japanese leaders for war crimes and crimes against\nhumanity. In 1948 the United Nations General Assembly first recognized the\nneed for a permanent international court to deal with atrocities of the kind\nprosecuted after World War II. At the request of the General Assembly, the\nInternational Law Commission (ILC) drafted two statutes by the early 1950s but\nthese were shelved during the Cold War, which made the establishment of an\ninternational criminal court politically unrealistic.\n\nBenjamin B. Ferencz, an investigator of Nazi war crimes after World War II and\nthe Chief Prosecutor for the United States Army at the Einsatzgruppen trial,\nbecame a vocal advocate of the establishment of international rule of law and\nof an international criminal court. In his book _Defining International\nAggression: The Search for World Peace_ (1975), he advocated for the\nestablishment of such a court. Another leading proponent was Robert Kurt\nWoetzel, a German-born professor of international law, who co-edited _Toward a\nFeasible International Criminal Court_ in 1970 and created the Foundation for\nthe Establishment of an International Criminal Court in 1971."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In June 1989, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, A. N. R. Robinson,\nrevived the idea of a permanent international criminal court by proposing the\ncreation of tribunal to address the illegal drug trade. In response, the\nGeneral Assembly tasked the ILC with once again drafting a statute for a\npermanent court.\n\nWhile work began on the draft, the UN Security Council established two _ad\nhoc_ tribunals in the early 1990s: The International Criminal Tribunal for the\nformer Yugoslavia, created in 1993 in response to large-scale atrocities\ncommitted by armed forces during the Yugoslav Wars, and the International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, created in 1994 following the Rwandan genocide.\nThe creation of these tribunals further highlighted to many the need for a\npermanent international criminal court.\n\nIn 1994, the ILC presented its final draft statute for the International\nCriminal Court to the General Assembly and recommended that a conference be\nconvened to negotiate a treaty that would serve as the Court's statute. To\nconsider major substantive issues in the draft statute, the General Assembly\nestablished the Ad Hoc Committee on the Establishment of an International\nCriminal Court, which met twice in 1995. After considering the Committee's\nreport, the General Assembly created the Preparatory Committee on the\nEstablishment of the ICC to prepare a consolidated draft text. From 1996 to\n1998, six sessions of the Preparatory Committee were held at the United\nNations headquarters in New York City, during which NGOs provided input and\nattended meetings under the umbrella organisation of the Coalition for the\nInternational Criminal Court (CICC). In January 1998, the Bureau and\ncoordinators of the Preparatory Committee convened for an Inter-Sessional\nmeeting in Zutphen in the Netherlands to technically consolidate and\nrestructure the draft articles into a draft.\n\nFinally, the General Assembly convened a conference in Rome in June 1998, with\nthe aim of finalizing the treaty to serve as the Court's statute. On 17 July\n1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was adopted by a\nvote of 120 to seven, with 21 countries abstaining. The seven countries that\nvoted against the treaty were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar, the U.S., and\nYemen.\n\nIsrael's opposition to the treaty stemmed from the inclusion in the list of\nwar crimes \"the action of transferring population into occupied territory\", a\nprovision added during the Rome Conference at the insistence of Arab countries\nwith the specific intention of targeting Israeli citizens.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted on 9 December 1999 and again on 12 December 2000\nto endorse the ICC. Following 60 ratifications, the Rome Statute entered into\nforce on 1 July 2002 and the International Criminal Court was formally\nestablished.\n\nThe first bench of 18 judges was elected by the Assembly of States Parties in\nFebruary 2003. They were sworn in at the inaugural session of the Court on 11\nMarch 2003.\n\nThe Court issued its first arrest warrants on 8 July 2005, and the first pre-\ntrial hearings were held in 2006.\n\nThe Court issued its first judgment in 2012 when it found Congolese rebel\nleader Thomas Lubanga Dyilo guilty of war crimes related to using child\nsoldiers. Lubanga was sentenced to 14 years in prison.\n\nIn 2010, the states parties of the Rome Statute held the first Review\nConference of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in Kampala,\nUganda. The Review Conference led to the adoption of two resolutions that\namended the crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court. Resolution 5 amended\nArticle 8 on war crimes, criminalizing the use of certain kinds of weapons in\nnon-international conflicts whose use was already forbidden in international\nconflicts. Resolution 6, pursuant to Article 5(2) of the Statute, provided the\ndefinition and a procedure for jurisdiction over the crime of aggression."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The ICC began operations on 1 July 2002, upon the entry into force of the Rome\nStatute, a multilateral treaty that serves as the court's charter and\ngoverning document. States which become party to the Rome Statute become\nmembers of the ICC, serving on the Assembly of States Parties, which\nadministers the court. As of January 2025, there are 125 ICC member states, 29\nstates have signed but not ratified the Rome Statute (including four who have\nwithdrawn their signature) and 41 states have neither signed nor become\nparties to the Rome Statute.\n\nIntended to serve as the \"court of last resort\", the ICC complements existing\nnational judicial systems and may exercise its jurisdiction only when national\ncourts are unwilling or unable to prosecute criminals. It lacks universal\nterritorial jurisdiction and may only investigate and prosecute crimes\ncommitted within member states, crimes committed by nationals of member\nstates, or crimes in situations referred to the Court by the United Nations\nSecurity Council.\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian president Vladimir Putin\nin June 2016\n\nThe ICC held its first hearing in 2006, concerning war crimes charges against\nThomas Lubanga Dyilo, a Congolese warlord accused of recruiting child\nsoldiers; his subsequent conviction in 2012 was the first in the court's\nhistory. The Office of the Prosecutor has opened twelve official\ninvestigations and is conducting an additional nine preliminary examinations.\n\nDozens of individuals have been indicted in the ICC, including Ugandan rebel\nleader Joseph Kony, former President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, President Uhuru\nKenyatta of Kenya, Libyan head of state Muammar Gaddafi, President Laurent\nGbagbo of Ivory Coast and former Vice President Jean-Pierre Bemba of the\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nOn 17 March 2023, ICC judges issued arrest warrants for Russian president\nVladimir Putin and the Presidential Commissioner for Children's Rights in\nRussia Maria Lvova-Belova for child abductions in the 2022 Russian invasion of\nUkraine. Russia denounced the arrest warrants as \"outrageous\". Putin became\nthe first head of state of a U.N. Security Council Permanent Member to be the\nsubject of an ICC arrest warrant. Although Russia withdrew its signature from\nthe Rome Statute in 2016, and is thus not a participant in the ICC nor under\nits jurisdiction, Putin can be charged for actions against Ukraine, which is\nnot a party but has accepted jurisdiction of the court since 2014. Should\nPutin travel to a state party, he can be arrested by local authorities. Later\nin 2023, Russia's Ministry of Internal Affairs retaliated by placing several\nICC officials on its wanted list. In March 2024, the ICC issued two more\narrest warrants, for Sergey Kobylash, the commander of the Long-Range Aviation\nof the Russian Aerospace Forces, and Viktor Sokolov, the commander of the\nBlack Sea Fleet over their role in war crimes in Ukraine.\n\nOn 20 May 2024, the ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced his intention\nto seek arrest warrants for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli\ndefense minister Yoav Gallant, leader of Hamas Yahya Sinwar, leader of the Al\nQassem Brigades Mohammed Deif, and Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in\nconnection to war crimes committed in the Israel-Hamas war. On November 21,\nwarrants were formally issued for Netanyahu, Gallant and Deif. Warrants for\nHaniyeh and Sinwar were withdrawn following confirmation of their deaths in\nJuly and October respectively.\n\nOn 23 January 2025, the ICC's chief prosecutor Karim Khan announced requests\nfor arrest warrants against Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and the\nchief justice of Afghanistan Abdul Hakim Haqqani, for crimes against humanity\nof the oppression and persecution of Afghan women and girls, who have been\ndeprived of the freedom of movement, the rights to control their bodies, to\neducation, and to a private and family life. Alleged resistance and opposition\nare brutally suppressed with murder, imprisonment, torture, rape, and other\nforms of sexual violence, since 2021. On 8 July 2025, the ICC's Pre-Trial\nChamber II issued the requested arrest warrants."

Such an\namendment was adopted at the first review conference of the ICC in Kampala,\nUganda, in June 2010.

The\nCourt's jurisdiction to prosecute crimes of aggression was accordingly\nactivated on 17 July 2018.\n\nThe Statute, as amended, defines the crime of aggression as \"the planning,\npreparation, initiation or execution, by a person in a position effectively to\nexercise control over or to direct the political or military action of a\nState, of an act of aggression which, by its character, gravity and scale,\nconstitutes a manifest violation of the Charter of the United Nations.\" The\nStatute defines an \"act of aggression\" as \"the use of armed force by a State\nagainst the sovereignty, territorial integrity or political independence of\nanother State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Charter of the\nUnited Nations.\" The article also contains a list of seven acts of aggression,\nwhich are identical to those in United Nations General Assembly Resolution\n3314 of 1974 and include the following acts when committed by one state\nagainst another state:\n\n1.

The\ncooperation of the non-party states with the ICC is envisioned by the Rome\nStatute of the International Criminal Court to be of voluntary nature. States\nnot acceded to the Rome Statute might still be subject to an obligation to\ncooperate with ICC in certain cases. When a case is referred to the ICC by the\nUN Security Council all UN member states are obliged to cooperate, since its\ndecisions are binding for all of them. Also, there is an obligation to respect\nand ensure respect for international humanitarian law, which stems from the\nGeneva Conventions and Additional Protocol I, which reflects the absolute\nnature of international humanitarian law.\n\nIn relation to cooperation in investigation and evidence gathering, it is\nimplied from the Rome Statute that the consent of a non-party state is a\nprerequisite for ICC Prosecutor to conduct an investigation within its\nterritory, and it seems that it is even more necessary for him to observe any\nreasonable conditions raised by that state, since such restrictions exist for\nstates party to the Statute. Taking into account the experience of the\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (which worked with\nthe principle of the primacy, instead of complementarity) in relation to\ncooperation, some scholars have expressed their pessimism as to the\npossibility of ICC to obtain cooperation of non-party states. As for the\nactions that ICC can take toward non-party states that do not cooperate, the\nRome Statute stipulates that the Court may inform the Assembly of States\nParties or Security Council, when the matter was referred by it, when non-\nparty state refuses to cooperate after it has entered into an _ad hoc_\narrangement or an agreement with the Court."

By denying states the right to offer\namnesty to human rights abusers, the International Criminal Court may make it\nmore difficult to negotiate an end to conflict and a transition to democracy.\nFor example, the outstanding arrest warrants for four leaders of the Lord's\nResistance Army are regarded by some as an obstacle to ending the insurgency\nin Uganda.

It has been argued that this decision raises important questions\nabout the court's present powers.\n\n_Ntaganda_ (DR Congo) was convicted to 30 years for crimes against humanity.\nThe _Bemba et al._ OAJ case and the _Laurent Gbagbo-Bl\u00e9 Goud\u00e9_ trial in the\nC\u00f4te d'Ivoire situation ended in acquittals. The _Banda_ trial in the\nsituation of Darfur, Sudan, was scheduled to begin in 2014 but the start date\nwas vacated.\n\nCharges against Malian Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi have been confirmed and he was\nsentenced to nine years in prison. On 25 November 2021, his sentence was\ncommuted to 7 years in prison, and he was released on 18 September 2022.\nUgandan Dominic Ongwen has been convicted to a prison sentence of 25 years.\n\nOn 6 July 2020, two Uyghur activist groups filed a complaint with the ICC\ncalling for it to investigate PRC officials for crimes against Uyghurs,\nincluding allegations of genocide. In December 2020, ICC prosecutors rejected\nthe complaint, stating that the ICC did not have jurisdictional basis to\nproceed.\n\nOn 31 October 2023, the Israeli families of over 34 victims of the 2023 Hamas-\nled attack on Israel, filed an Article 15 communication with the ICC\nprosecutor's office urging an investigation into the killings and abductions,\nand the ICC confirmed the receipt of the filing. Reporters Without Borders\nalso lodged a complaint regarding the deaths of eight Palestinian journalists\nin the Gaza Strip during Israel's bombardment, as well as an Israeli\njournalist killed during a surprise attack by Hamas in southern Israel."

Every communication is first given an initial assessment to determine if it is sufficiently serious and if it falls within the Court's jurisdiction (phase 1). If it does, the Office begins a preliminary examination by first considering whether the alleged crimes fall within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Court (phase 2). If the Office is satisfied that all the jurisdictional requirements are met, it then focuses on issues of admissibility by considering complementarity and the gravity of the alleged crimes (phase 3). If there are no admissibility concerns, the Office then considers the interests of justice and decides whether or not to begin a formal investigation (phase 4). Once a formal investigation is opened, it is also processed through different phases. It is first processed through an \"investigation phase\" (phase 1), in which the Office determines the scope of its caseload, and then through a \"prosecution phase\" (phase 2), in which the Office completes the caseload.\n2. **^** The preliminary examination of the situation in Iraq / the United Kingdom was initially closed on 9 February 2006, but was reopened on 13 May 2014.\n3. **^** Following the start of the investigation, Chile, Costa Rica, Spain, France, Luxembourg, and Mexico referred the situation.\n4. **^** A new preliminary investigation of the situation in Palestine was opened on 16 January 2015 and proceeded to a full investigation 3 March 2021.\n5. **^** The preliminary examination relates to registered vessels of the Comoros, Greece and Cambodia.\n6. **^** The Prosecutor previously closed the preliminary examination of the situation on registered vessels of the Comoros, Greece and Cambodia on 6 November 2014, but reconsidered her decision following a request by the Pre-Trial Chamber on 29 November 2017 and revised the final decision on 2 December 2019.\n7. **^** Albania, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, New Zealand, Norway, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom jointly referred the situation in Ukraine on 2 March 2022. Following the start of the investigation, Japan and North Macedonia also referred the situation.\n8. **^** Following the start of the investigation, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Chile, Comoros, Djibouti, Mexico, and South Africa also referred the situation.\n9. ^ _**a**_ _**b**_ Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru jointly referred the situation in Venezuela I on 27 September 2018. Venezuela referred the situation in Venezuela II on 13 February 2020. In a statement, the Prosecutor noted that the two referrals \"appear to overlap geographically and temporally\" but further noted that such a statement \"should not prejudice a later determination on whether the referred scope of the two situations is sufficiently linked to constitute a single situation.\"\n\n\nSummary of investigations and prosecutions by the International Criminal Court (not including reparations proceedings)  Situation  | Publicly indicted  | Ongoing procedures  | Procedures finished, due to ...  | PTC | TCs\n---|---|---|---|---|---\nNot before court  | Pre-Trial  | Trial  | Appeal  | Death  | Inadmissibility  | Acquittal etc.  | Conviction\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo | 6  | 1\nMudacumura | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 2\nChui, Mbarushimana | 3\nKatanga, Lubanga, Ntaganda | I  |\nUganda | 5  | 1\nKony | 0  | 0  | 0  | 3\nLukwiya, Odhiambo, Otti | 0  | 0  | 1\nOngwen | III  |\nCentral African Republic I  | 5  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1\nBemba (main case) | 5\nKilolo, Babala, Mangenda, Arido, Bemba (OAJ) | II  |\nDarfur, Sudan | 7  | 3\nHaroun, al-Bashir, Hussein | 1\nBanda | 1\nAbd-Al-Rahman | 0  | 1\nJerbo | 0  | 1\nAbu Garda | 0  | II  | I\nKushayb\nIV\nBanda\nKenya | 9  | 2\nBarasa, Bett | 0  | 0  | 0  | 1\nGicheru | 0  | 6\nKosgey, Ali, Muthaura, Kenyatta, Ruto, Sang | 0  | II  |\nLibya | 14  | 10\nS.

The Rome Statute grants certain powers to the United\nNations Security Council, which limit its functional independence. Article 13\nallows the Security Council to refer to the Court situations that would not\notherwise fall under the Court's jurisdiction (as it did in relation to the\nsituations in Darfur and Libya, which the Court could not otherwise have\nprosecuted as neither Sudan nor Libya are state parties). Article 16 allows\nthe Security Council to require the Court to defer from investigating a case\nfor a period of twelve months. Such a deferral may be renewed indefinitely by\nthe Security Council. This sort of an arrangement gives the ICC some of the\nadvantages inhering in the organs of the United Nations such as using the\nenforcement powers of the Security Council, but it also creates a risk of\nbeing tainted with the political controversies of the Security Council.\n\nThe Court cooperates with the UN in many different areas, including the\nexchange of information and logistical support. The Court reports to the UN\neach year on its activities, and some meetings of the Assembly of States\nParties are held at UN facilities. The relationship between the Court and the\nUN is governed by a \"Relationship Agreement between the International Criminal\nCourt and the United Nations\"."

        "generated_section_content_md": "During the 1970s and 1980s, international human rights and humanitarian\nNongovernmental Organizations (or NGOs) began to proliferate at exponential\nrates. Concurrently, the quest to find a way to punish international crimes\nshifted from being the exclusive responsibility of legal experts to being\nshared with international human rights activism.\n\nNGOs helped birth the ICC through advocacy and championing for the prosecution\nof perpetrators of crimes against humanity. NGOs closely monitor the\norganization's declarations and actions, ensuring that the work that is being\nexecuted on behalf of the ICC is fulfilling its objectives and\nresponsibilities to civil society. According to Benjamin Schiff, \"From the\nStatute Conference onward, the relationship between the ICC and the NGOs has\nprobably been closer, more consistent, and more vital to the Court than have\nanalogous relations between NGOs and any other international organization.\"\n\nThere are a number of NGOs working on a variety of issues related to the ICC.\nThe NGO Coalition for the International Criminal Court has served as a sort of\numbrella for NGOs to coordinate with each other on similar objectives related\nto the ICC. The CICC has 2,500 member organizations in 150 countries. The\noriginal steering committee included representatives from the World Federalist\nMovement, the International Commission of Jurists, Amnesty International, the\nLawyers Committee for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, Parliamentarians for\nGlobal Action, and No Peace Without Justice. Today, many of the NGOs with\nwhich the ICC cooperates are members of the CICC. These organizations come\nfrom a range of backgrounds, spanning from major international NGOs such as\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International, to smaller, more local\norganizations focused on peace and justice missions. Many work closely with\nstates, such as the International Criminal Law Network, founded and\npredominantly funded by the Hague municipality and the Dutch Ministries of\nDefense and Foreign Affairs. The CICC also claims organizations that are\nthemselves federations, such as the International Federation of Human Rights\nLeagues (FIDH).\n\nCICC members subscribe to three principles that permit them to work under the\numbrella of the CICC, so long as their objectives match them:\n\n* Promoting worldwide ratification and implementation of the Rome Statute of the ICC\n* Maintaining the integrity of the Rome Statute of the ICC, and\n* Ensuring the ICC will be as fair, effective and independent as possible\n\nThe NGOs that work under the CICC do not normally pursue agendas exclusive to\nthe work of the Court, rather they may work for broader causes, such as\ngeneral human rights issues, victims' rights, gender rights, rule of law,\nconflict mediation, and peace. The CICC coordinates their efforts to improve\nthe efficiency of NGOs' contributions to the Court and to pool their influence\non major common issues. From the ICC side, it has been useful to have the CICC\nchannel NGO contacts with the Court so that its officials do not have to\ninteract individually with thousands of separate organizations.\n\nNGOs have been crucial to the evolution of the ICC, as they assisted in the\ncreation of the normative climate that urged states to seriously consider the\nCourt's formation. Their legal experts helped shape the Statute, while their\nlobbying efforts built support for it. They advocate Statute ratification\nglobally and work at expert and political levels within member states for\npassage of necessary domestic legislation. NGOs are greatly represented at\nmeetings for the Assembly of States Parties, and they use the ASP meetings to\npress for decisions promoting their priorities. Many of these NGOs have\nreasonable access to important officials at the ICC because of their\ninvolvement during the Statute process. They are engaged in monitoring,\ncommenting upon, and assisting in the ICC's activities.\n\nThe ICC often depends on NGOs to interact with local populations. The Registry\nPublic Information Office personnel and Victims Participation and Reparations\nSection officials hold seminars for local leaders, professionals and the media\nto spread the word about the Court. These are the kinds of events that are\noften hosted or organized by local NGOs. Because there can be challenges with\ndetermining which of these NGOs are legitimate, CICC regional representatives\noften have the ability to help screen and identify trustworthy organizations.\n\nNGOs are also \"sources of criticism, exhortation and pressure upon\" the ICC.\nThe ICC heavily depends on NGOs for its operations. Although NGOs and states\ncannot directly impact the judicial nucleus of the organization, they can\nimpart information on crimes, can help locate victims and witnesses, and can\npromote and organize victim participation. NGOs outwardly comment on the\nCourt's operations, \"push for expansion of its activities especially in the\nnew justice areas of outreach in conflict areas, in victims' participation and\nreparations, and in upholding due-process standards and defense 'equality of\narms' and so implicitly set an agenda for the future evolution of the ICC.\"\nThe relatively uninterrupted progression of NGO involvement with the ICC may\nmean that NGOs have become repositories of more institutional historical\nknowledge about the ICC than its national representatives, and have greater\nexpertise than some of the organization's employees themselves. While NGOs\nlook to mold the ICC to satisfy the interests and priorities that they have\nworked for since the early 1990s, they unavoidably press against the limits\nimposed upon the ICC by the states that are members of the organization. NGOs\ncan pursue their own mandates, irrespective of whether they are compatible\nwith those of other NGOs, while the ICC must respond to the complexities of\nits own mandate as well as those of the states and NGOs.\n\nAnother issue has been that NGOs possess \"exaggerated senses of their\nownership over the organization and, having been vital to and successful in\npromoting the Court, were not managing to redefine their roles to permit the\nCourt its necessary independence.\" Additionally, because there does exist such\na gap between the large human rights organizations and the smaller peace-\noriented organizations, it is difficult for ICC officials to manage and\ngratify all of their NGOs. \"ICC officials recognize that the NGOs pursue their\nown agendas, and that they will seek to pressure the ICC in the direction of\ntheir own priorities rather than necessarily understanding or being fully\nsympathetic to the myriad constraints and pressures under which the Court\noperates.\" Both the ICC and the NGO community avoid criticizing each other\npublicly or vehemently, although NGOs have released advisory and cautionary\nmessages regarding the ICC. They avoid taking stances that could potentially\ngive the Court's adversaries, particularly the U.S., more motive to berate the\norganization."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Kenyan politician William Ruto in February 2013\n\nThe ICC has been accused of bias and as being a tool of Western imperialism,\nonly punishing leaders from small, weak states while ignoring crimes committed\nby richer and more powerful states. This sentiment has been expressed\nparticularly by African leaders due to an alleged disproportionate focus of\nthe Court on Africa, while it claims to have a global mandate. Until January\n2016, all nine situations which the ICC had been investigating were in African\ncountries.\n\nAfrican critics have suggested the ICC is acting as a neo-colonial force\nseeking to further empower Western political and extractive interests in\nAfrica. Scholar Awol Allo has described the court's underlying problem that\nhas led to these challenges with Africa as not overt racism, but Eurocentrism.\nAnother analysis suggests that African states are motivated by concerns over\nAfrica's place in world order: the problem is the sovereign inequality\ndisplayed by the ICC prosecutor's focus.\n\nThe prosecution of Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto and President Uhuru\nKenyatta (both charged before coming into office) led to the Kenyan parliament\npassing a motion calling for Kenya's withdrawal from the ICC, and the country\ncalled on the other 33 African states party to the ICC to withdraw their\nsupport, an issue which was discussed at a special African Union (AU) summit\nin October 2013.\n\nThough the ICC has denied the charge of disproportionately targeting African\nleaders, and claims to stand up for victims wherever they may be, Kenya was\nnot alone in criticising the ICC. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir visited\nKenya, South Africa, China, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates,\nEgypt, Ethiopia, Qatar and several other countries despite an outstanding ICC\nwarrant for his arrest but was not arrested; he said that the charges against\nhim are \"exaggerated\" and that the ICC was a part of a \"Western plot\" against\nhim. Ivory Coast's government opted not to transfer former first lady Simone\nGbagbo to the court but to instead try her at home. Rwanda's ambassador to the\nAfrican Union, Joseph Nsengimana, argued that, \"It is not only the case of\nKenya. We have seen international justice become more and more a political\nmatter.\" Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni accused the ICC of \"mishandling\ncomplex African issues\". Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, at the\ntime AU chairman, told the UN General Assembly at the General debate of the\nsixty-eighth session of the United Nations General Assembly: \"The manner in\nwhich the ICC has been operating has left a very bad impression in Africa. It\nis totally unacceptable.\""

At the summit, the AU\ndid not endorse the proposal for a collective withdrawal from the ICC due to\nlack of support for the idea. The summit concluded that serving heads of state\nshould not be put on trial and that the Kenyan cases should be deferred.\nEthiopian formerly Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom said: \"We have rejected the\ndouble standard that the ICC is applying in dispensing international justice.\"\nDespite these calls, the ICC went ahead with requiring William Ruto to attend\nhis trial. The UNSC was then asked to consider deferring the trials of\nKenyatta and Ruto for a year, but this was rejected. In November, the ICC's\nAssembly of State Parties responded to Kenya's calls for an exemption for\nsitting heads of state by agreeing to consider amendments to the Rome Statute\nto address the concerns.\n\nOn 7 October 2016, Burundi announced that it would leave the ICC, after the\ncourt began investigating political violence in that nation. In the two weeks\nthat followed, South Africa and The Gambia also announced their intention to\nleave the court, with Kenya and Namibia reportedly also considering departure.\nAll three nations cited the fact that all 39 people indicted by the court over\nits history by that date had been African and that the court has made no\neffort to investigate war crimes tied to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following\nThe Gambia's presidential election later that year, which ended the long rule\nof Yahya Jammeh, the new government rescinded its withdrawal notification. The\nHigh Court of South Africa ruled on 2 February 2017 that the South African\ngovernment's notice to withdraw was unconstitutional and invalid. On 7 March\n2017 the South African government formally revoked its intention to withdraw.\nThe ruling ANC revealed on 5 July 2017 that its intention to withdraw stands."

In 2018, when the Israeli government wanted to\ndemolish the West Bank village of Khan al Ahmar, Bensouda explicitly warned\nIsrael that doing so could be considered a \u2018war crime\u2019. The Israeli\ngovernment's response was to publicly defy the court, describing the\nprosecutor's statement as \u2018pure anti-Semitism\u2019 in Netanyahu\u2019s words.\n\n_The Guardian_ reported in 2024, on the basis of anonymous sources, that\nIsrael had conducted a nine-year \"war\" against the ICC. These sources alleged\nthat Israeli intelligence agencies were used to \"surveil, hack, pressure,\nsmear and allegedly threaten senior ICC staff in an effort to derail the\ncourt's inquiries.\" In particular, Yossi Cohen, director of Mossad at the\ntime, allegedly threatened Bensouda and her family in an attempt to dissuade\nher from opening war crime inquiries against Israel. The anonymous sources are\nsaid to be familiar with disclosures Bensouda made to the ICC regarding the\noperation.\n\nIn November 2024, after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Israeli prime\nminister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant on\ncharges of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the Gaza war,\nNetanyahu accused the ICC of antisemitism, while Gallant argued the Court set\n\"a dangerous precedent against the right to self-defence and ethical warfare\nand encourages murderous terrorism.\" In that same November, Israel appealed\nthe ICC warrants against Netanyahu and Gallant.\n\nIn November 2024, France argued that the arrest warrants for Israeli leaders\nare not valid because Israel is not a member of the ICC. In that same month,\nthen-Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, announced that Canada would\nabide by the arrest warrants and arrest and deport Netanyahu if he entered\nthat country. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on various\noccasions that Italy would not arrest Prime Minister Netanyahu. In January\n2025, Polish prime minister Donald Tusk guaranteed safe passage for senior\nIsraeli officials, including Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to an\nevent in Poland marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.\nThe majority of the Polish public disagreed with the government's decision not\nto arrest Netanyahu.\n\nGermany's CDU leader Friedrich Merz criticized the ICC's decision to issue an\narrest warrant for Netanyahu. In February 2025, one day after the 2025 German\nfederal election, he announced his will to invite Netanyahu to Germany, \"as an\nopen challenge\" to the decision of the ICC.\n\nIn April 2025, Netanyahu visited Hungary, a state party to the Rome Statute of\nthe ICC. During the visit, the Hungarian government's prime minister, Viktor\nOrb\u00e1n announced that it would withdraw from the ICC, describing it as\n\"politically biased\". The withdrawal will become effective after one year's\nwritten notice. Hungary will join Israel, the US, Russia, China and North\nKorea among nations which do not recognise the ICC's jurisdiction. On May 20,\n2025, the Hungarian National Assembly approved a bill to initiate the\ncountry's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC), marking\nHungary as the first European Union member state to take such action. The\nbill, introduced by Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semj\u00e9n, passed with 134 votes\nin favor, 37 against, and 7 abstentions. This move has drawn criticism from\nhuman rights organizations and may strain Hungary's relations within the\nEuropean Union, where all member states are ICC members."

Bush signed the American Service-Members'\nProtection Act (informally referred to as _The Hague Invasion Act_) to signify\nthe United States' opposition to any possible future jurisdiction of the court\nor its tribunals. The act gives the President the power to use \"all means\nnecessary and appropriate to bring about the release of any U.S. or allied\npersonnel being detained or imprisoned by, on behalf of, or at the request of\nthe International Criminal Court\". During the administration of Barack Obama,\nU.S. opposition to the ICC evolved to \"positive engagement\", but no effort was\nmade to ratify the Rome Statute.\n\nThe subsequent Donald Trump administration was considerably more hostile to\nthe Court, similar to the Bush administration, threatening prosecution and\nfinancial sanctions on ICC judges and staff in U.S. courts as well as imposing\nvisa bans in response to any investigation against American nationals in\nconnection to alleged crimes and atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. in\nAfghanistan. The threat included sanctions against any of over 120 countries\nthat have ratified the Court for cooperating in the process. In November 2017,\nFatou Bensouda advised the court to consider seeking charges for human rights\nabuses committed during the War in Afghanistan such as alleged rapes and\ntortures by the U.S. Armed Forces and the Central Intelligence Agency, crime\nagainst humanity committed by the Taliban, and war crimes committed by the\nAfghan National Security Forces. John Bolton, National Security Advisor of the\nUnited States, stated that ICC had no jurisdiction over the U.S., which had\nnot ratified the Rome Statute. In 2020, overturning the previous decision not\nto proceed, senior judges at the ICC authorized an investigation into the\nalleged war crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nOn 11 June 2020, the United States announced sanctions on officials and\nemployees, as well as their families, involved in investigating alleged crimes\nagainst humanity committed by U.S. armed forces in Afghanistan. This move was\nwidely criticized by human rights groups. The U.S. ordered sanctions against\nthe ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, and the ICC's head of Jurisdiction,\nComplementary, and Cooperation Division, Phakiso Mochochok, for an\ninvestigation into alleged war crimes by U.S. forces and the Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA) in Afghanistan since 2003. Attorney General William\nBarr said, \"The US government has reason to doubt the honesty of the ICC. The\nDepartment of Justice has received substantial credible information that\nraises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and\nmalfeasance at the highest levels of the office of the prosecutor\". The ICC\nresponded with a statement expressing \"profound regret at the announcement of\nfurther threats and coercive actions.\" \"These attacks constitute an escalation\nand an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court's\njudicial proceedings\", the statement said. \"They are announced with the\ndeclared aim of influencing the actions of ICC officials in the context of the\ncourt's independent and objective investigations and impartial judicial\nproceedings.\"\n\nOn 30 September 2020, prominent United States human rights lawyers announced\nthat they would sue Trump and his Administration\u2014including Barr, Secretary of\nState Mike Pompeo, Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, and OFAC director Andrea\nGacki, and the departments they head\u2014on the grounds that Trump's Executive\nOrder 13928 order had gagged them, violating their right to free speech and\nimpeding their work in trying to obtain justice on behalf of victims of war\ncrimes. One of the plaintiffs, Diane Marie Amann, stated that, as a result of\nsanctions against the chief prosecutor at the ICC, she herself risked having\nher family assets seized if she continued to work for children who are bought\nand sold by traffickers, killed, tortured, sexually abused and forced to\nbecome child soldiers.\n\nOn 4 January 2021, U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla in New York City\nissued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration from imposing\ncriminal or civil penalties against ICC personnel and those who support the\ncourt's work, including the plaintiffs. The sanctions were subsequently lifted\nby the Biden administration Secretary of State Antony Blinken in April 2021.\n\nIn 2023, the Biden administration welcomed the issuing of an ICC arrest\nwarrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin. President Joe Biden said that\nthe issuing of the warrant \"makes a very strong point\". In 2024, the Biden\nadministration opposed an arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu over alleged Israeli war crimes committed during the Gaza war in the\nGaza Strip. Biden denounced Netanyahu's arrest warrant as \"outrageous.\"\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration would work\nwith the US Congress on potential sanctions against the ICC. Prior to the\nissuing of the ICC's arrest warrant for Netanyahu, a group of US Republican\nsenators sent a letter to ICC prosecutor Karim Ahmad Khan that contained the\nwarning \"Target Israel and we will target you. If you move forward ... we will\nmove to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and\nassociates, and bar you and your families from the United States. You have\nbeen warned.\" The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction ICC\nofficials on 4 June 2024.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White\nHouse, 4 February 2025\n\nOn 9 January 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the _Illegitimate\nCourt Counteraction Act_ by 243\u2013140 to sanction the ICC in protest at its\narrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant issued in November 2024. On 6\nFebruary 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing\neconomic and travel sanctions on individuals involved in ICC investigations\ntargeting U.S. citizens and allies, notably Israel. This action coincided with\nNetanyahu visiting Washington. The sanctions entail freezing U.S. assets of\ndesignated individuals and prohibiting their entry into the United States.\nThis move mirrors a similar stance taken during Trump's first term, when\nsanctions were applied to ICC officials over investigations into alleged war\ncrimes by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOn 5 June 2025 the United States Department of State sanctioned four ICC\njudges\u2014Solomy Balungi Bossa of Uganda, Luz del Carmen Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Carranza of Peru,\nReine Adelaide Sophie Alapini Gansou of Benin, and Beti Hohler of\nSlovenia\u2014under President Trump\u2019s Executive Order 14203, \u201cImposing Sanctions on\nthe International Criminal Court.\u201d The four judges were accused of engaging in\nefforts \"to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute a protected person\nwithout consent of that person\u2019s country of nationality\"\u2014 viz, of the United\nStates or Israel. The sanctions effectively block those individuals' property\ninterests and all other beneficial financial transactions within the United\nStates."

In June 2017, Victor Tsilonis\nadvanced the same criticism which is reinforced by events, practices of the\nOffice of the Prosecutor and ICC cases in the Essays in Honour of Nestor\nCourakis.
