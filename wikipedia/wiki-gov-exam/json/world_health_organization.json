It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and has 6\nregional offices and 150 field offices worldwide. Only sovereign states are\neligible to join, and it is the largest intergovernmental health organization\nat the international level.\n\nThe WHO's purpose is to achieve the highest possible level of health for all\nthe world's people, defining health as \"a state of complete physical, mental\nand social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\" The\nmain functions of the World Health Organization include promoting the control\nof epidemic and endemic diseases; providing and improving the teaching and\ntraining in public health, the medical treatment of disease, and related\nmatters; and promoting the establishment of international standards for\nbiological products.\n\nThe WHO was established on 7 April 1948, and formally began its work on 1\nSeptember 1948. It incorporated the assets, personnel, and duties of the\nLeague of Nations' Health Organization and the Paris-based Office\nInternational d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique, including the International Classification\nof Diseases (ICD). The agency's work began in earnest in 1951 after a\nsignificant infusion of financial and technical resources.\n\nThe WHO's official mandate is to promote health and safety while helping the\nvulnerable worldwide. It provides technical assistance to countries, sets\ninternational health standards, collects data on global health issues, and\nserves as a forum for scientific or policy discussions related to health. Its\nofficial publication, the _World Health Report_ , provides assessments of\nworldwide health topics.\n\nThe WHO has played a leading role in several public health achievements, most\nnotably the eradication of smallpox, the near-eradication of polio, and the\ndevelopment of an Ebola vaccine. Its current priorities include communicable\ndiseases, such as HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria and tuberculosis; non-communicable\ndiseases such as heart disease and cancer; healthy diet, nutrition, and food\nsecurity; occupational health; and substance abuse. The agency advocates for\nuniversal health care coverage, engagement with the monitoring of public\nhealth risks, coordinating responses to health emergencies, and promoting\nhealth and well-being generally.\n\nThe WHO is governed by the World Health Assembly (WHA), which is composed of\nits 194 member states. The WHA elects and advises an executive board made up\nof 34 health specialists; selects the WHO's chief administrator, the director-\ngeneral (currently Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of Ethiopia); sets goals and\npriorities; and approves the budget and activities. The WHO is funded\nprimarily by contributions from member states (both assessed and voluntary),\nfollowed by private donors."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The International Sanitary Conferences (ISC), the first of which was held on\n23 June 1851, were a series of conferences that took place until 1938, about\n87 years. The first conference, in Paris, was almost solely concerned with\ncholera, which would remain the disease of major concern for the ISC for most\nof the 19th century. With the cause, origin, and communicability of many\nepidemic diseases still uncertain and a matter of scientific argument,\ninternational agreement on appropriate measures was difficult to reach. Seven\nof these international conferences, spanning 41 years, were convened before\nany resulted in a multi-state international agreement. The seventh conference,\nin Venice in 1892, finally resulted in a convention. It was concerned only\nwith the sanitary control of shipping traversing the Suez Canal, and was an\neffort to guard against importation of cholera.\n\nFive years later, in 1897, a convention concerning the bubonic plague was\nsigned by sixteen of the nineteen states attending the Venice conference.\nWhile Denmark, Sweden-Norway, and the US did not sign this convention, it was\nunanimously agreed that the work of the prior conferences should be codified\nfor implementation. Subsequent conferences, from 1902 until the final one in\n1938, widened the diseases of concern for the ISC, and included discussions of\nresponses to yellow fever, brucellosis, leprosy, tuberculosis, and typhoid. In\npart as a result of the successes of the Conferences, the Pan-American\nSanitary Bureau (1902), and the Office International d'Hygi\u00e8ne Publique or\n\"International office of Public Hygiene\" in English (1907) were soon founded.\nWhen the League of Nations was formed in 1920, it established the Health\nOrganization of the League of Nations. After World War II, the United Nations\nabsorbed all the other health organizations, to form the WHO.\n\nThe WHO has played a crucial role in coordinating the global response to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, providing essential guidelines on preventive measures,\nsupporting research on vaccines, and facilitating vaccine distribution through\ninitiatives like COVAX."

After failing to get a resolution\npassed on the subject, Alger Hiss, the secretary general of the conference,\nrecommended using a declaration to establish such an organization. Sze and\nother delegates lobbied and a declaration passed calling for an international\nconference on health. The use of the word \"world\", rather than\n\"international\", emphasized the truly global nature of what the organization\nwas seeking to achieve. The constitution of the World Health Organization was\nsigned by all 51 countries of the United Nations, and by 10 other countries,\non 22 July 1946. It thus became the first specialized agency of the United\nNations to which every member subscribed. Its constitution formally came into\nforce on the first World Health Day on 7 April 1948, when it was ratified by\nthe 26th member state. The WHO formally began its work on September 1, 1948.\n\nThe first meeting of the World Health Assembly finished on 24 July 1948,\nhaving secured a budget of US$5 million (then \u00a31,250,000) for the 1949 year.\nG. Brock Chisholm was appointed director-general of the WHO, having served as\nexecutive secretary and a founding member during the planning stages, while\nAndrija \u0160tampar was the assembly's first president. Its first priorities were\nto control the spread of malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted\ninfections, and to improve maternal and child health, nutrition and\nenvironmental hygiene. Its first legislative act was concerning the\ncompilation of accurate statistics on the spread and morbidity of disease. The\nlogo of the World Health Organization features the Rod of Asclepius as a\nsymbol for healing.\n\nIn 1959, the WHO signed Agreement WHA 12\u201340 with the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), which says:\n\n> whenever either organization proposes to initiate a programme or activity on\n> a subject in which the other organization has or may have a substantial\n> interest, the first party shall consult the other with a view to adjusting\n> the matter by mutual agreement.\n\nThe nature of this statement has led some groups and activists including Women\nin Europe for a Common Future to claim that the WHO is restricted in its\nability to investigate the effects on human health of radiation caused by the\nuse of nuclear power and the continuing effects of nuclear disasters in\nChernobyl and Fukushima. They believe WHO must regain what they see as\nindependence. Independent WHO held a weekly vigil from 2007 to 2017 in front\nof WHO headquarters. However, as pointed out by Foreman in clause 2 it states:\n\n> In particular, and in accordance with the Constitution of the World Health\n> Organization and the Statute of the International Atomic Energy Agency and\n> its agreement with the United Nations together with the exchange of letters\n> related thereto, and taking into account the respective co-ordinating\n> responsibilities of both organizations, it is recognized by the World Health\n> Organization that the International Atomic Energy Agency has the primary\n> responsibility for encouraging, assisting and co-ordinating research and\n> development and practical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses\n> throughout the world without prejudice to the right of the World Health\n> Organization to concern itself with promoting, developing, assisting and co-\n> ordinating international health work, including research, in all its\n> aspects.\n\nThe key text is highlighted in bold, the agreement in clause 2 states that the\nWHO is free to perform any health-related work."

They would not\nreturn until 1956.\n\n1950: A mass tuberculosis inoculation drive using the BCG vaccine gets under\nway.\n\n1955: The malaria eradication programme was launched, although objectives were\nlater modified. (In most areas, the programme goals became control instead of\neradication.)\n\n1958: Viktor Zhdanov, Deputy Minister of Health for the USSR, called on the\nWorld Health Assembly to undertake a global initiative to eradicate smallpox,\nresulting in Resolution WHA11.54.\n\n1965: The first report on diabetes mellitus and the creation of the\nInternational Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\n1966: The WHO moved its headquarters from the Ariana wing at the Palace of\nNations to a newly constructed headquarters elsewhere in Geneva.\n\n1967: The WHO intensified the global smallpox eradication campaign by\ncontributing $2.4 million annually to the effort and adopted a new disease\nsurveillance method, at a time when 2 million people were dying from smallpox\nper year. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of\nsmallpox cases. WHO established a network of consultants who assisted\ncountries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. The WHO also\nhelped contain the last European outbreak in Yugoslavia in 1972. After over\ntwo decades of fighting smallpox, a Global Commission declared in 1979 that\nthe disease had been eradicated \u2013 the first disease in history to be\neliminated by human effort.\n\n1974: The Expanded Programme on Immunization and the control programme of\nonchocerciasis was started, an important partnership between the Food and\nAgriculture Organization (FAO), the United Nations Development Programme\n(UNDP), and the World Bank.\n\n1975: The WHO launched the Special Programme for Research and Training in\nTropical diseases (the TDR). Co-sponsored by UNICEF, UNDP, and the World Bank,\nit was established in response to a 1974 request from the WHA for an intensive\neffort to develop improved control of tropical diseases. The TDR's goals are,\nfirstly, to support and coordinate international research into diagnosis,\ntreatment and control of tropical diseases; and, secondly, to strengthen\nresearch capabilities within endemic countries.\n\n1976: The WHA enacted a resolution on disability prevention and\nrehabilitation, with a focus on community-driven care.\n\n1977 and 1978: The first list of essential medicines was drawn up, and a year\nlater the ambitious goal of \"Health For All\" was declared.\n\nThree former directors of the Global Smallpox Eradication Programme read the\nnews that smallpox had been globally eradicated, 1980.\n\n1986: The WHO began its global programme on HIV/AIDS. Two years later\npreventing discrimination against patients was attended to and in 1996 the\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was formed.\n\n1988: The Global Polio Eradication Initiative was established.\n\n1995: The WHO established an independent International Commission for the\nCertification of Dracunculiasis Eradication (Guinea worm disease eradication;\nICCDE). The ICCDE recommends to the WHO which countries fulfil requirements\nfor certification. It also has role in advising on progress made towards\nelimination of transmission and processes for verification.\n\n1998: The WHO's director-general highlighted gains in child survival, reduced\ninfant mortality, increased life expectancy and reduced rates of \"scourges\"\nsuch as smallpox and polio on the fiftieth anniversary of WHO's founding. He,\ndid, however, accept that more had to be done to assist maternal health and\nthat progress in this area had been slow.\n\n2000: The Stop TB Partnership was created along with the UN's formulation of\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\n\n2001: The measles initiative was formed, and credited with reducing global\ndeaths from the disease by 68% by 2007.\n\n2002: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was drawn up to\nimprove the resources available.\n\n2005: The WHO revises International Health Regulations (IHR) in light of\nemerging health threats and the experience of the 2002/3 SARS epidemic,\nauthorizing WHO, among other things, to declare a health threat a Public\nHealth Emergency of International Concern.\n\n2006: The WHO endorsed the world's first official HIV/AIDS Toolkit for\nZimbabwe, which formed the basis for global prevention, treatment, and support\nthe plan to fight the AIDS pandemic.\n\n2006: The WHO launches the Global action plan for influenza vaccines\n\n2016: The Global action plan for influenza vaccines ends with a report which\nconcludes that _while substantial progress has been made over the 10 years of\nthe Plan, the world is still not ready to respond to aninfluenza pandemic._\n\n2016: Following the perceived failure of the response to the West Africa Ebola\noutbreak, the World Health Emergencies programme was formed, changing the WHO\nfrom just being a \"normative\" agency to one that responds operationally to\nhealth emergencies.\n\n2020: the World Health Organization announced that it had classified the novel\ncoronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.\nThe novel coronavirus was a new strain of coronavirus that had never been\ndetected in humans before. The WHO named this new coronavirus \"COVID-19\" or\n\"2019-nCov\".\n\n2022: The WHO suggests formation of a Global Health Emergency Council, with a\nnew global health emergency workforce, and recommends revision of the\nInternational Health Regulations.\n\n2024: WHO has declared the spread of mpox (formerly monkeypox) in several\nAfrican countries a public health emergency of international concern, marking\nthe second such declaration in the last two years due to the virus's\ntransmission."

This is in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n(SDGs) and other intergovernmental agreements, and means \"empowering people,\ncommunities and civil society through inclusive participation in decision-\nmaking processes that affect health across the policy cycle and at all levels\nof the system.\""

        "generated_section_content_md": "During the 1970s, WHO had dropped its commitment to a global malaria\neradication campaign as too ambitious, it retained a strong commitment to\nmalaria control. WHO's Global Malaria Programme works to keep track of malaria\ncases, and future problems in malaria control schemes. As of 2012, the WHO was\nto report as to whether RTS,S/AS01, were a viable malaria vaccine. For the\ntime being, insecticide-treated mosquito nets and insecticide sprays are used\nto prevent the spread of malaria, as are antimalarial drugs \u2013 particularly to\nvulnerable people such as pregnant women and young children.\n\nIn 1988, WHO launched the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to eradicate\npolio. It has also been successful in helping to reduce cases by 99% since WHO\npartnered with Rotary International, the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention (CDC), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and smaller\norganizations. As of 2011[update], it has been working to immunize young\nchildren and prevent the re-emergence of cases in countries declared \"polio-\nfree\". In 2017, a study was conducted as to why Polio Vaccines may not be\nenough to eradicate the Virus & conduct new technology. Polio is now on the\nverge of extinction, thanks to a Global Vaccination Drive. The World Health\nOrganization (WHO) stated the eradication programme has saved millions from\ndeadly disease.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2010, WHO's help has contributed to a 40% decline in the\nnumber of deaths from tuberculosis, and since 2005, over 46 million people\nhave been treated and an estimated 7 million lives saved through practices\nadvocated by WHO. These include engaging national governments and their\nfinancing, early diagnosis, standardizing treatment, monitoring of the spread\nand effect of tuberculosis, and stabilizing the drug supply. It has also\nrecognized the vulnerability of victims of HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis.\n\nIn 2003, the WHO denounced the Roman Curia's health department's opposition to\nthe use of condoms, saying: \"These incorrect statements about condoms and HIV\nare dangerous when we are facing a global pandemic which has already killed\nmore than 20 million people, and currently affects at least 42 million.\" As of\n2009[update], the Catholic Church remains opposed to increasing the use of\ncontraception to combat HIV/AIDS. At the time, the World Health Assembly\npresident, Guyana's Health Minister Leslie Ramsammy, condemned Pope Benedict's\nopposition to contraception, saying he was trying to \"create confusion\" and\n\"impede\" proven strategies in the battle against the disease.\n\nIn 2007, the WHO organized work on pandemic influenza vaccine development\nthrough clinical trials in collaboration with many experts and health\nofficials. A pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus was declared by the\nthen director-general Margaret Chan in April 2009. Margret Chan declared in\n2010 that the H1N1 has moved into the post-pandemic period. By the post-\npandemic period, critics claimed the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading\n\"fear and confusion\" rather than \"immediate information\". Industry experts\ncountered that the 2009 pandemic had led to \"unprecedented collaboration\nbetween global health authorities, scientists and manufacturers, resulting in\nthe most comprehensive pandemic response ever undertaken, with a number of\nvaccines approved for use three months after the pandemic declaration. This\nresponse was only possible because of the extensive preparations undertaken\nduring the last decade\".\n\nThe 2012\u20132013 WHO budget identified five areas among which funding was\ndistributed. Two of those five areas related to communicable diseases: the\nfirst, to reduce the \"health, social and economic burden\" of communicable\ndiseases in general; the second to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis\nin particular.\n\nAs of 2015[update], the World Health Organization has worked within the UNAIDS\nnetwork and strives to involve sections of society other than health to help\ndeal with the economic and social effects of HIV/AIDS. In line with UNAIDS,\nWHO has set itself the interim task between 2009 and 2015 of reducing the\nnumber of those aged 15\u201324 years who are infected by 50%; reducing new HIV\ninfections in children by 90%; and reducing HIV-related deaths by 25%.\n\nThe World Health Organization's definition of neglected tropical disease has\nbeen criticized to be restrictive (focusing only on communicable diseases) and\ndescribed as a form of epistemic injustice, where conditions like snakebite\nare forced to be framed as a medical problem."

On 5 January the WHO notified all member\nstates of the outbreak, and in subsequent days provided guidance to all\ncountries on how to respond, and confirmed the first infection outside China.\nOn 14 January 2020, the WHO announced that preliminary investigations\nconducted by Chinese authorities had found no clear evidence of human-to-human\ntransmission of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified in Wuhan. The\nsame day, the organization warned of limited human-to-human transmission, and\nconfirmed human-to-human transmission one week later.

The Country Health Intelligence\nPortal (CHIP), has also been developed to provide an access point to\ninformation about the health services that are available in different\ncountries. The information gathered in this portal is used by the countries to\nset priorities for future strategies or plans, implement, monitor, and\nevaluate it.\n\nThe WHO has published various tools for measuring and monitoring the capacity\nof national health systems and health workforces. The Global Health\nObservatory (GHO) has been the WHO's main portal which provides access to data\nand analyses for key health themes by monitoring health situations around the\nglobe.\n\nThe _WHO Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems_ (WHO-AIMS), the _WHO\nQuality of Life Instrument_ (WHOQOL), and the _Service Availability and\nReadiness Assessment_ (SARA) provide guidance for data collection.\nCollaborative efforts between WHO and other agencies, such as through the\nHealth Metrics Network, also aim to provide sufficient high-quality\ninformation to assist governmental decision making. WHO promotes the\ndevelopment of capacities in member states to use and produce research that\naddresses their national needs, including through the Evidence-Informed Policy\nNetwork (EVIPNet). The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/AMRO) became the\nfirst region to develop and pass a policy on research for health approved in\nSeptember 2009.\n\nOn 10 December 2013, a new WHO database, known as MiNDbank, went online. The\ndatabase was launched on Human Rights Day, and is part of WHO's QualityRights\ninitiative, which aims to end human rights violations against people with\nmental health conditions. The new database presents a great deal of\ninformation about mental health, substance abuse, disability, human rights,\nand the different policies, strategies, laws, and service standards being\nimplemented in different countries. It also contains important international\ndocuments and information. The database allows visitors to access the health\ninformation of WHO member states and other partners. Users can review\npolicies, laws, and strategies and search for the best practices and success\nstories in the field of mental health.\n\nThe WHO regularly publishes a _World Health Report_ , its leading publication,\nincluding an expert assessment of a specific global health topic. Other\npublications of WHO include the _Bulletin of the World Health Organization_ ,\nthe _Eastern Mediterranean Health Journal_ (overseen by EMRO), the _Human\nResources for Health_ (published in collaboration with BioMed Central), and\nthe _Pan American Journal of Public Health_ (overseen by PAHO/AMRO).\n\nIn 2016, the World Health Organization drafted a global health sector strategy\non HIV. In the draft, the World Health Organization outlines its commitment to\nending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 with interim targets for the year 2020. To\nmake achievements towards these targets, the draft lists actions that\ncountries and the WHO can take, such as a commitment to universal health\ncoverage, medical accessibility, prevention and eradication of disease, and\nefforts to educate the public. Some notable points made in the draft include\ntailoring resources to mobilized regions where the health system may be\ncompromised due to natural disasters, etc. Among the points made, it seems\nclear that although the prevalence of HIV transmission is declining, there is\nstill a need for resources, health education, and global efforts to end this\nepidemic.\n\nThe WHO has a Framework Convention on Tobacco implementation database which is\none of the few mechanisms to help enforce compliance with the FCTC. However,\nthere have been reports of numerous discrepancies between it and national\nimplementation reports on which it was built. As researchers Hoffman and Rizvi\nreport \"As of July 4, 2012, 361 (32\u00b77%) of 1104 countries' responses were\nmisreported: 33 (3\u00b70%) were clear errors (e.g., database indicated 'yes' when\nreport indicated 'no'), 270 (24\u00b75%) were missing despite countries having\nsubmitted responses, and 58 (5\u00b73%) were, in our opinion, misinterpreted by WHO\nstaff\".\n\nWHO has been moving toward acceptance and integration of traditional medicine\nand traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). In 2022, the new International\nStatistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, ICD-11,\nwill attempt to enable classifications from traditional medicine to be\nintegrated with classifications from evidence-based medicine. Though Chinese\nauthorities have pushed for the change, this and other support of the WHO for\ntraditional medicine has been criticized by the medical and scientific\ncommunity, due to lack of evidence and the risk of endangering wildlife hunted\nfor traditional remedies. A WHO spokesman said that the inclusion was \"not an\nendorsement of the scientific validity of any Traditional Medicine practice or\nthe efficacy of any Traditional Medicine intervention.\""

The adoption of the United Nations General Assembly\nResolution 2758 in 1971, however, had the representation of \"China\" handed\nover to the People's Republic of China (PRC), and led to the expulsion of the\nRepublic of China from WHO and other UN bodies. Since that time, per the One-\nChina policy, both the ROC and PRC lay claims of sovereignty to each other's\nterritory.\n\nIn May 2009, the Department of Health of the Republic of China was invited by\nthe WHO to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an observer under the name\n\"Chinese Taipei\". This was the ROC's first participation at WHO meetings since\n1971, as a result of the improved cross-strait relations since Ma Ying-jeou\nbecame the president of the Republic of China a year before. Its participation\nwith WHO ended due to diplomatic pressure from the PRC following the election\nin 2016 that brought the independence-minded Democratic Progressive Party back\ninto power.\n\nPolitical pressure from the PRC has led to the ROC being barred from\nmembership of the WHO and other UN-affiliated organizations, and in 2017 to\n2020 the WHO refused to allow Taiwanese delegates to attend the WHO annual\nassembly. According to Taiwanese publication The News Lens, on multiple\noccasions Taiwanese journalists have been denied access to report on the\nassembly.\n\nIn May 2018, the WHO denied access to its annual assembly by Taiwanese media,\nreportedly due to demands from the PRC. Later in May 172 members of the United\nStates House of Representatives wrote to the director-general of the World\nHealth Organization to argue for Taiwan's inclusion as an observer at the WHA.\nThe United States, Japan, Germany, and Australia all support Taiwan's\ninclusion in WHO.\n\nPressure to allow the ROC to participate in WHO increased as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic with Taiwan's exclusion from emergency meetings concerning\nthe outbreak bringing a rare united front from Taiwan's diverse political\nparties. Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT, Chinese\nNationalist Party), expressed their anger at being excluded arguing that\ndisease respects neither politics nor geography. China once again dismissed\nconcerns over Taiwanese inclusion with the foreign minister claiming that no-\none cares more about the health and wellbeing of the Taiwanese people than\ncentral government of the PRC. During the outbreak Canadian Prime Minister\nJustin Trudeau voiced his support for Taiwan's participation in WHO, as did\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In January 2020 the European Union, a WHO\nobserver, backed Taiwan's participation in WHO meetings related to the\ncoronavirus pandemic as well as their general participation.\n\nIn a 2020 interview, Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward appeared to\ndodge a question from RTHK reporter Yvonne Tong about Taiwan's response to the\npandemic and inclusion in the WHO, blaming internet connection issues. When\nthe video chat was restarted, he was asked another question about Taiwan. He\nresponded by indicating that they had already discussed China and formally\nended the interview. This incident led to accusations about the PRC's\npolitical influence over the international organization.\n\nTaiwan's effective response to the 2019\u201320 COVID-19 pandemic has bolstered its\ncase for WHO membership. Taiwan's response to the outbreak has been praised by\na number of experts. In early May 2020, New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston\nPeters expressed support for the ROC's bid to rejoin the WHO during a media\nconference. The New Zealand Government subsequently supporting Taiwan's bid to\njoin the WHO, putting NZ alongside Australia and the United States who have\ntaken similar positions.\n\nOn 9 May, Congressmen Eliot Engel, the Democratic chairman of the United\nStates House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCaul, the House\nCommittee's ranking Republican member, Senator Jim Risch, the Republican\nchairman of the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and\nSenator Bob Menendez, the Senate Committee's ranking Democratic member,\nsubmitted a joint letter to nearly 60 \"like-minded\" countries including\nCanada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, and\nAustralia, urging them to support ROC's participation in the World Health\nOrganization.\n\nIn November 2020, the word \"Taiwan\" was blocked in comments on a livestream on\nthe WHO's Facebook page."

In\n2020\u201321, the largest contributors were the Germany, Gates Foundation, United\nStates, United Kingdom and European Commission. The WHO Executive Board formed\na Working Group on Sustainable Financing in 2021, charged to rethink WHO's\nfunding strategy and present recommendations. Its recommendations were adopted\nby the 2022 World Health Assembly, the key one being to raise compulsory\nmember dues to a level equal to 50% of WHO's 2022\u20132023 base budget by the end\nof the 2020s.\n\nTop 10 contributors (biennium 2020\u20132021; updated until Q4-2021) in millions of US$  No. | Contributor | Assessed contributions | Voluntary contributions specified | Core voluntary contributions | Total\n(biennium) | Share | Source\n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---\n1 | Germany | 58 | 953 |  | 1,011 | 14.4% |\n2 | United States of America | 232 | 448 |  | 681 | 9.7% |\n3 | Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation |  | 592 |  | 592 | 8.4% |\n4 | United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland | 44 | 367 | 120 | 531 | 7.6% |\n5 | GAVI Alliance |  | 371 |  | 371 | 5.3% |\n6 | European Commission |  | 310 |  | 310 | 4.4% |\n7 | Japan | 82 | 122 |  | 204 | 2.9% |\n8 | China | 115 | 63 |  | 178 | 2.5% |\n9 | World Bank |  | 158 |  | 158 | 2.2% |\n10 | Rotary International |  | 152 |  | 152 | 2.2% |\nOthers | 530 | 2,306 | 144 | 2,980 | 42.4% |\nTotal | 957 | 5,824 | 264 | 7,031 | 100.0% |\n\n* Assessed contributions are the dues the Member States pay depending on the states' wealth and population\n* Voluntary contributions specified are funds for specific programme areas provided by the Member States or other partners\n* Core voluntary contributions are funds for flexible uses provided by the Member States or other partners"

        "generated_section_content_md": "At the beginning of the 21st century, the WHO's work involved increasing\ncollaboration with external bodies. As of 2002[update], a total of 473\nnongovernmental organizations (NGO) had some form of partnership with WHO.\nThere were 189 partnerships with international NGOs in formal \"official\nrelations\" \u2013 the rest being considered informal in character. Partners include\nthe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nAs of 2012[update], the largest annual assessed contributions from member\nstates came from the United States ($110 million), Japan ($58 million),\nGermany ($37 million), United Kingdom ($31 million) and France ($31 million).\nThe combined 2012\u20132013 budget proposed a total expenditure of $3,959 million,\nof which $944 million (24%) will come from assessed contributions. This\nrepresented a significant fall in outlay compared to the previous 2009\u20132010\nbudget, adjusting to take account of previous underspends. Assessed\ncontributions were kept the same. Voluntary contributions will account for\n$3,015 million (76%), of which $800 million is regarded as highly or\nmoderately flexible funding, with the remainder tied to particular programmes\nor objectives.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, the WHO routinely spends about $200 million\na year on travel expenses, more than it spends to tackle mental health\nproblems, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. In 2016, Margaret Chan,\ndirector-general of WHO from January 2007 to June 2017, stayed in a $1000-per-\nnight hotel room while visiting West Africa.\n\nThe biggest contributor used to be the United States, which gives over $400\nmillion annually. U.S. contributions to the WHO are funded through the U.S.\nState Department's account for Contributions to International Organizations\n(CIO). In April 2020, U.S. President Donald Trump, with backing by members of\nhis party, announced that his administration would halt funding to the WHO.\nFunds previously earmarked for the WHO were to be held for 60\u201390 days pending\nan investigation into the WHO's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nparticularly in respect to the organization's purported relationship with\nChina. The announcement was immediately criticized by world leaders including\nAnt\u00f3nio Guterres, the secretary general of the United Nations; Heiko Maas, the\nGerman foreign minister; and Moussa Faki Mahamat, African Union chairman.\nDuring the first two years of the pandemic, American funding of the WHO\ndeclined by a quarter, although it is expected to increase during 2022 and\n2023.\n\nOn 16 May 2020, the Trump Administration agreed to pay up to what China pays\nin assessed contributions, which is less than about one-tenth of its previous\nfunding. Biennium 2018\u20132019 China paid in assessed contributions US$75,796K,\nin specified voluntary contributions US$10,184K, for a total US$85,980K."

Many decisions are made at the regional level, including important\ndiscussions over WHO's budget, and in deciding the members of the next\nassembly, which are designated by the regions.\n\nEach region has a regional committee, which generally meets once a year,\nnormally in the autumn. Representatives attend from each member or associative\nmember in each region, including those states that are not full members. For\nexample, Palestine attends meetings of the Eastern Mediterranean Regional\nOffice. Each region also has a regional office. Each regional office is headed\nby a director, who is elected by the Regional Committee. The board must\napprove such appointments, although as of 2004, it had never over-ruled the\npreference of a regional committee. The exact role of the board in the process\nhas been a subject of debate, but the practical effect has always been small.\nSince 1999, regional directors serve for a once-renewable five-year term, and\ntypically take their position on 1 February.\n\nEach regional committee of the WHO consists of all the Health Department\nheads, in all the governments of the countries that constitute the Region.\nAside from electing the regional director, the regional committee is also in\ncharge of setting the guidelines for the implementation, within the region, of\nthe health and other policies adopted by the World Health Assembly. The\nregional committee also serves as a progress review board for the actions of\nWHO within the Region.[_citation needed_] The regional director is effectively\nthe head of WHO for his or her region. The RD manages and/or supervises a\nstaff of health and other experts at the regional offices and in specialized\ncentres. The RD is also the direct supervising authority \u2013 concomitantly with\nthe WHO Director-General \u2013 of all the heads of WHO country offices, known as\nWHO Representatives, within the region.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe strong position of the regional offices has been criticized in WHO history\nfor undermining its effectiveness and led to unsuccessful attempts to\nintegrate them more strongly within 'One WHO'. Disease specific programmes\nsuch as the smallpox eradication programme or the 1980s Global Programme on\nAIDS were set up with more direct, vertical structures that bypassed the\nregional offices.\n\nRegional offices of WHO  Region  | Headquarters  | Notes\n---|---|---\nAfrica  | Brazzaville, Republic of the Congo  | AFRO includes most of Africa, with the exception of Egypt, Sudan, Djibouti, Tunisia, Libya, Somalia and Morocco (all fall under EMRO).
