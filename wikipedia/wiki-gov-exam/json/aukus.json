Pillar 1 focuses on Australia\nacquiring nuclear-powered attack submarines and the rotational basing of US\nand UK nuclear-powered attack submarines in Australia. Pillar 2 entails the\ncollaborative development of advanced capabilities in six technological areas:\nundersea capabilities, quantum technologies, artificial intelligence and\nautonomy, advanced cyber, hypersonic and counter-hypersonic capabilities, and\nelectronic warfare; and in two broader functional areas: innovation and\ninformation sharing.\n\nAUKUS is widely seen as a response to the perception among its members that\nthe People's Republic of China poses a threat to the Indo-Pacific region. The\nChinese government said, when the partnership was announced, that it risked\n\"severely damaging regional peace\" and had a \"cold-war mentality\".\n\nA direct result of the creation of the partnership was Australia's\ncontroversial cancellation of a French-Australian submarine contract worth \u20ac56\nbillion (A$90 billion). The Australian government only gave the French\ngovernment a few hours notice of this before the public announcement of AUKUS.\nThe Australian government agreed to a \u20ac555 million (US$584 million)\ncompensation settlement with French defence contractor Naval Group."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 2009, two years after the start of the project to replace the Royal\nAustralian Navy's conventionally-powered _Collins_ -class submarines, the\nAustralian Defence White Paper stated: \"The Government has ruled out nuclear\npropulsion for these submarines\".\n\nIn 2016, Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull signed a A$50 billion (\u20ac31\nbillion) deal with the majority French government-owned company Naval Group\n(known as DCNS until 2017) to design a new generation of submarines, known as\nthe _Attack_ class, under the \"Future Submarine Program\", scheduled to replace\nthe _Collins_ class. The design was based on the latest French nuclear-powered\nattack submarine, the Barracuda class, which required converting the nuclear\npropulsion to conventional propulsion. Another difference was that Australia\nchose to equip it with a United States Navy combat system and torpedo with\nLockheed Martin Australia selected to integrate them into the design.\nAustralia typically requires that part of their vessels be built there, which\nincreases the cost. In this case it corresponded to 60 per cent of the\ncontract value, with France handling the technology transfer.\n\nIn 2019, Australia signed a strategic partnership agreement with Naval Group\nto design and construct twelve submarines to be built in Australia. However,\nthe project was beset by delays and cost overruns, leading to uncertainty and\ntension behind the scenes. The revised cost, including inflation during the\nlength of the program, was A$90 billion (\u20ac56 billion).\n\nIn February 2021, an initial design plan was rejected as being too expensive,\nand Naval Group were given until September to improve their proposal. At a\nSenate inquiry in early June 2021, with delays ongoing, Defence Secretary Greg\nMoriarty revealed under questioning that he had considered making contingency\nplans if the French project was to fail, admitting that there had been ongoing\nproblems[_vague_] for over a year. Two weeks later, Australian prime minister\nScott Morrison met French president Emmanuel Macron in Paris and expressed\nconcern about the project going off track, to which Macron replied that France\nwas giving \"full and complete\" commitment and would proceed \"further and\nfaster if possible\".\n\nOn 30 August 2021, the French and Australian defence and foreign affairs\nministers released a joint statement reaffirming the project, stating that the\n\"Ministers underlined the importance of the Future Submarine program.\"\n\nLess than three weeks later, Australia decided to publicly cancel the contract\nwith Naval Group for the _Attack_ class submarines despite having already\nspent about A$2.4 billion on the French project. It was expected that\nAustralia would have to pay hundreds of millions of euros in penalties for\ncancelling the contract. The contract contained \"control gates\" with \"off-\nramps\" at which point Australia could withdraw from the contract.\n\nThe Australian Department of Defence wrote to Naval Group on the same day the\nsecurity partnership was announced. The French Ministry of Defence claim the\ndepartment told them that \"they were satisfied with the submarine's achievable\nperformance and with the progress of the program.\" Naval Group said that\nAustralia \"terminated the contract for convenience\".\n\nMorrison said that Australia now required a nuclear-powered submarine which\nhas the advantages of greater speed, remaining underwater for longer and\ncarrying heavier loads than a conventionally powered submarine, based on a\nchange in the strategic situation in the Indo-Pacific."

A\ntrilateral discussion was held between Johnson, Biden and Morrison at the June\n2021 G7 summit held in Cornwall, England. The talks took place without the\nknowledge of the French government or Naval Group. This approach was possible\nas a result of the UK not entering into a formal foreign policy and security\ntreaty in the post-Brexit deal with the EU. As a result, the UK was free to\npursue enhanced cooperation with other allies. _Axios_ reported that the Biden\nadministration sought assurances from Australia that cancelling the contract\nwas not dependent on the US providing them with assistance and that cancelling\nwas a fait accompli. Morrison said Australia had been considering an\nalternative to the _Attack_ class submarine deal for the past 18 months.\n\nAlthough the joint announcement by Australian prime minister Scott Morrison,\nBritish prime minister Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden did not\nmention any other country by name, except France, anonymous White House\nsources have alleged it is designed to counter the influence of Chinese forces\nin the Indo-Pacific region. However, Johnson later told parliament that the\nmove was not intended to be \"adversarial towards any other power\".\n\nUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken and United States Secretary of\nDefense Lloyd Austin said that Australia did not have any \"reciprocal\nrequirements\" as a consequence of the US sharing nuclear submarine propulsion\ntechnology such as Australia hosting intermediate-range missiles.\n\nIn 2024, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, made undisclosed\n\"political commitments\" with its AUKUS partners in an agreement for the\ntransfer of naval nuclear technology to Australia, sparking concerns about the\npotential for high-level radioactive waste to be stored in the country. The\nWhite House confirmed that Australia, the UK, and the US reached a significant\nmilestone in their cooperation, essential for Australia's future nuclear-\npowered submarine capabilities. Despite assurances from the government,\ncritics, including the Greens, warned of possible loopholes that could lead to\nuranium enrichment and radioactive waste management in Australia."

The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) will acquire at\nleast eight nuclear-powered submarines armed with conventional weapons. The\nbasic design and key technologies will be decided by the Australian Nuclear-\nPowered Submarine Task Force an 18-month Department of Defence research\nproject headed by Vice Admiral Jonathan Mead, begun in September 2021 with\nassistance from the US and UK.\n\nAustralia will extend the life of its _Collins_ class submarines that the\n_Attack_ class was due to replace and may consider leasing or buying nuclear-\npowered submarines from the US or the UK in the interim until the delivery of\nits future nuclear powered submarines. Also in the interim, Australian Defence\nMinister Peter Dutton said that Australia will have regular visits by US and\nUK nuclear-powered submarines. The annual Australia-US Ministerial\nConsultations (AUSMIN) between the Australian Ministers for Foreign Affairs\nand Defence and the US Secretaries of State and Defense held in September 2021\nendorsed \"increasing logistics and sustainment capabilities of US surface and\nsubsurface vessels in Australia.\"\n\nAustralia considered purchasing French nuclear submarines which use nuclear\nreactors fuelled by low-enriched uranium at less than 6%. However, French\nreactor designs have to be refuelled every ten years, and Australia does not\nhave a civil nuclear capability with nuclear energy prohibited. In contrast,\nAmerican and British designs power the submarines for the expected life of the\nsubmarines using nuclear reactors fuelled by highly enriched uranium (HEU) at\n93% enrichment.\n\nCurrently, only six countries have nuclear submarines, the five permanent\nmembers of the UN Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom\nand the United States) and India. The New York Times reported that Australia\nwill probably buy HEU from the US for the nuclear reactor that powers the\nsubmarine. The United States' naval reactors are all pressurized water\nreactors (PWR). The latest UK propulsion system is the Rolls-Royce PWR3 that\nwill power the Royal Navy's (RN) new _Dreadnought_ -class submarines currently\nbeing built and is \"based on a US design but using UK reactor technology\".\n\nUS officials have said that sharing nuclear propulsion technology with\nAustralia is a \"one-off\" and that they have no \"intention of extending this to\nother countries\". South Korea, also a US treaty ally, has had ambitions to\nacquire nuclear-powered submarines since 2017 and was reportedly refused US\nassistance in September 2020 because of nuclear non-proliferation.\n\nOn 22 November 2021, Australia, the US and the UK signed the _Exchange of\nNaval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement_ (ENNPIA) treaty. The treaty\npermits the disclosure of information by the US and the UK to Australia and\nits use. The US is restricted by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946 from sharing\ninformation without an agreement and the UK is also restricted by the 1958 US-\nUK Mutual Defence Agreement unless authorised. The treaty was considered in\nAustralia by the Parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, in the UK\nby the Parliament and in the US by Congress. The ENNPIA treaty entered into\nforce on 8 February 2022.\n\nOne of the first three Royal Australian Navy officers to graduate from the US\nNavy's Nuclear Power School posing with Australian and American dignitaries in\nJuly 2023\n\nOn 31 August 2022, the UK announced that Australian submariners would receive\ntraining aboard _Astute_ -class submarines.\n\nOn 13 March 2023, AUKUS announced that a new nuclear powered submarine class\nwould be built in the UK and Australia to be called the SSN-AUKUS, also known\nas the SSN-A. The US intends to sell Australia three nuclear-powered\n_Virginia_ class submarines, subject to congressional approval, to ensure\nthere is no capability gap as the _Collins_ class submarines are retired, with\nthe potential to sell up to two more if needed. RAN personnel will be embedded\nin the RN and USN to receive nuclear training and at UK and US submarine\nindustrial bases. The Submarine Rotational Force-West initiative which will\nfrom as early as 2027 base USN _Virginia_ class and RN _Astute_ class\nsubmarines on a rotational basis at the RAN's HMAS _Stirling_ submarine base\nin order to accelerate Australia's ability to operate nuclear-powered\nsubmarines and to contribute to security in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThe SSN-AUKUS class will based on the UK SSNR design already under\ndevelopment. The RN is planned to receive its first SSN-AUKUS class submarine\nas early as the late 2030s. The RAN is planned to receive their first\nsubmarine in the early 2040s. Australia will reportedly build five SSN-AUKUS\nsubmarines. The RAN is planned to receive their first _Virginia_ class\nsubmarine from the US in the early 2030s.\n\nThe Australian Submarine Agency was established on 1 July 2023. It has the\nrole of managing the Australian nuclear submarine program, and includes\npersonnel posted to the UK and US.\n\nIn November 2023, Capt. Lincoln Reifsteck USN, the USN's AUKUS integration and\nacquisition program manager, talked at the Naval Submarine League's annual\nsymposium. He said that, in 2032 and 2035, the USA will sell to Australia in-\nservice Block IV _Virginia_ class submarines, the first of which was\ncommissioned in 2020, and the final will likely commission around 2026. Thus,\nAustralia would receive submarines with between six and 15 years' worth of\nuse, out of their designed service life of 33 years. He also said that the USA\nwould sell a new Block VII boat to Australia in 2038, the Block VIIs being the\noriginal _Virginia_ class length without the Virginia Payload Module, set to\nbegin construction in FY2029.\n\nOn 1 June 2025, the UK government announced that it will build up to twelve\nSSN-AUKUS submarines to replace the Royal Navy's seven _Astute-_ class attack\nsubmarines from the late 2030s. The announcement also said that there will be\na major expansion of industrial capability at BAE Systems Submarines at Barrow\nand at Rolls-Royce Submarines at Derby, with a new boat scheduled to be built\nevery eighteen months. On 26 July 2025, the UK and Australian governments\nsigned the Geelong Treaty, a 50-year bilateral defence agreement to facilitate\nbilateral cooperation on the construction of Australia's SSN-AUKUS submarines."

In the _Bulletin of the\nAtomic Scientists_ , scholar S\u00e9bastien Philippe criticised AUKUS and wrote \"we\ncan now expect the proliferation of very sensitive military nuclear technology\nin the coming years, with literally tons of new nuclear materials under loose\nor no international safeguards\". James M. Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for\nInternational Peace wrote that \"the nonproliferation implications of the AUKUS\nsubmarine deal are both negative and serious. For Australia to operate\nnuclear-powered submarines, it will have to become the first non-nuclear-\nweapon state to exercise a loophole that allows it to remove nuclear material\nfrom the inspection system of the International Atomic Energy Agency. I have\nno real concerns that Australia will misuse this material itself, but I am\nconcerned that this removal will set a damaging precedent.

Concerns were raised that this may lead to\nincreased risk of arms proliferation if other countries follow the same\napproach because it would involve other countries enriching uranium for naval\nreactors, potentially creating more avenues to develop material needed for\nnuclear weapons without the safeguards provided by regular inspections. This\nwould not apply in the case of Brazil because the reactor will use low\nenriched uranium at 7% concentration. 20% is the minimum level required to\nmake a nuclear weapon."

Dutton further\ndismissed \"outbursts from China\" and said that Australia was a \"proud\ndemocracy\" committed to \"enduring peace and this collaboration makes it a\nsafer region ... no amount of propaganda can dismiss the facts\".\n\nAustralian Greens leader Adam Bandt criticised the deal, saying that it\nescalates tensions in the region and \"makes Australia less safe\".\n\nIn December 2022, the online publication East Asia Forum (based at the\nAustralian National University) published an article stating that AUKUS\nhighlights the need for Australia to have an advanced industrial base to\nsustain its planned acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines, as well as to\nsupport hypersonic and artificial intelligence (AI) military systems.\n\nIn July 2025, former Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison appeared before\nthe US House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist\nParty to emphasize the importance of the AUKUS security pact as a key\ncomponent of the response to China's economic and strategic pressure on\nAustralia. Morrison highlighted that China targeted Australia to make an\nexample of its loyalty as a US ally in the region and urged the United States\nto maintain strong economic and security ties with like-minded democracies\nthrough initiatives such as AUKUS to deter coercion."

The project was reportedly going to employ 4,000 people\nin France over six years at Naval Group and its 200 subcontractors. The French\ngovernment was angered by both the cancellation of the _Attack_ class\nsubmarine project and not being made aware of the negotiations that led to the\nAUKUS agreement. In a joint statement, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le\nDrian and armed forces minister Florence Parly expressed disappointment at\nAustralia's decision to abandon their joint submarine program with France.\n\nOn 31 October 2021, at the G20 summit in Rome, Macron was asked whether\nMorrison lied about the French submarine contract to which Macron responded \"I\ndon't think, I know\". The French Ambassador also criticised Morrison on the\nbasis that he lied about the former contract.\n\nLe Drian further stated in a radio interview that the contract termination was\na \"stab in the back\". On 17 September, France recalled its ambassadors from\nAustralia and the US, Jean-Pierre Th\u00e9bault and Philippe \u00c9tienne respectively.\nDespite tension in the past, France had never before withdrawn its ambassador\nto the United States. In a statement, Le Drian said that the \"exceptional\ndecision is justified by the exceptional gravity of the [AUKUS] announcements\"\nand that the snap cancellation of the submarine contract \"constitute[d]\nunacceptable behaviour between allies and partners\". French president Emmanuel\nMacron has not commented but is reported to have been \"furious\" about the turn\nof events. In response to questions about the Australia-EU trade deal\ncurrently being negotiated, French Secretary of State for European Affairs\nCl\u00e9ment Beaune stated that he doesn't see how France can trust Australia.\nArnaud Danjean, a French MEP, said that \"Australians can expect more than a\ndelay in concluding the Free Trade Agreement with the EU\". French Lowy\nInstitute policy analyst Herv\u00e9 Lemahieu said the diplomatic damage from the\ncancellation will take years to repair and leave a lasting legacy of\nmistrust\". After a call between the French and US presidents, the French\nambassador returned to the US on 30 September.\n\nBeaune described the United Kingdom as a junior partner and vassal of the\nUnited States due to the partnership, saying in an interview: \"Our British\nfriends explained to us they were leaving the EU to create Global Britain. We\ncan see that this is a return into the American lap and a form of accepted\nvassalisation.\" Le Drian stated that \"We have recalled our ambassadors to\n[Canberra and Washington] to re-evaluate the situation. With Britain, there is\nno need. We know their constant opportunism. So there is no need to bring our\nambassador back to explain.\" A Franco-British defence summit was cancelled.\n\nSome opposition politicians in France, such as Xavier Bertrand, Jordan\nBardella, and Fabien Roussel, criticised the French government and demanded\nthat France leave NATO, with Christian Jacob as well as demanding a\nparliamentary inquiry.\n\nA foreign ministers meeting between France, Germany, the UK, and the US had\nbeen postponed, and a ministerial meeting between Australia, France, and India\nwas cancelled. France however, contacted India to talk about strengthening\ntheir cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. France's foreign commerce minister\ndeclined a meeting with his Australian counterpart.\n\nFrench president Macron said that Europe needs to stop being na\u00efve when it\ncomes to defending its interests and build its own military capacity.\n\nFollowing the ousting of Scott Morrison's government after the 2022 Australian\nfederal election, the new Labor government led by Prime Minister Anthony\nAlbanese agreed to a \u20ac555 million (US$584 million) settlement with French\ndefence contractor Naval Group. In response, French defence minister Lecornu\nsaid that France aims to rebuild its relationship with Australia. In addition,\nAlbanese announced plans to travel to France to reset bilateral relations\nbetween the two countries.\n\nThe exclusion of France from AUKUS has been conceptualised within the longue\ndur\u00e9e of the fractious relationship between France and the Anglosphere,\npotentially reducing scope for coordination in the Indo-Pacific in the short\nterm."

Opposition politicians quickly attacked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau over Canada's exclusion from the partnership, to which Trudeau responded by stating that \"This is a deal for nuclear submarines, which Canada is not currently or any time soon in the market for. Australia is.\" Leader of the Official Opposition Erin O'Toole stated that he would seek to join the alliance if elected.\n* Denmark \u2013 Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said that Joe Biden is \"very loyal\" to Europe and that \"we should not turn... challenges, which will always exist between allies, into something they should not be.\" The Prime Minister also said she did not understand the criticism coming from Paris and Brussels.\n* Fiji \u2013 The day after both Indonesia and Malaysia aired concerns at the sweeping plan, Albanese met Fijian counterpart Sitiveni Rabuka on Wednesday to assure him the pact would help ensure regional stability. In a briefing later, a senior member of the Australian government said the message from the Fijian leader was that he supported the AUKUS agreement and Fiji's ties with its traditional security partners. In March 2023 Mr Rabuka met Prime Minister Anthony Albanese during his brief stop in Fiji on his way back from San Diego. Mr Rabuka told reporters travelling with Mr Albanese in Fiji that he backed AUKUS, and that Mr Albanese had assured him Australia's submarine push would not undermine the Treaty of Rarotonga, which declares that the South Pacific is a nuclear weapons-free zone.\n* Germany\u2013 German Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth described the row as a \"wake up call\" and stated that the EU must speak with one voice and that rebuilding lost trust will not be easy.\n* Indonesia \u2013 The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has expressed concerns about the implications of the Australian acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines for \"the continuing arms race and power projection in the region\". It called on Canberra to maintain its commitment to regional peace and stability. Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi stated the situation \"would certainly not benefit anyone\" and that \"efforts to maintain a peaceful and stable region must continue\". Indonesia later cancelled a planned visit by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison amid the fallout of the AUKUS deal. On 22 September 2021, the Commission I of the People's Representative Council urged President Joko Widodo to take a strong stand over the AUKUS deal through the auspices of ASEAN. Commission I member Rizki Aulia Rahman described the formation of AUKUS as a threat to Indonesian national defence and sovereignty. The Foreign Ministry responded that they were working on a response to the issues posed by AUKUS.\n* Kiribati \u2013 President Taneti Maamau said that the deal puts the region at risk and that he was not consulted in relation to it. In the past the UK and US tested nuclear weapons in Kiribati, so they are concerned about nuclear submarines being developed. Kiribati recently switched diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to the China mainland. Beijing told Kiribati it is listening, whereas they felt that Australia is not listening to them. Mr Maamau said he is looking to Australia to show leadership as it debates a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. Mr Maamuu also stated he was surprised at the absence of \"courtesy\" Australia displayed in not discussing the proposed agreement with its Pacific \"neighbours\".\n* Malaysia \u2013 Malaysian Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said he had raised concerns about the project with Mr. Morrison, and warned that the nuclear submarine project might heighten military tensions in Asia. He urged all parties to avoid any provocation, as well as an arms race in the region. \"At the same time, it will provoke other powers to take more aggressive action in this region, especially in the South China Sea,\" Mr Yaakob said. Ismail Sabri also stressed the importance of respecting and adhering to Malaysia's existing stance and approach to nuclear-powered submarines operating in Malaysian waters, including under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty. After a meeting with Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Malaysian Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah stated, \"Although [Australia] stated that these are nuclear-powered summaries and not nuclear-armed ones, both our governments expressed concern and disturbance.\" Australia has since dispatched officials to Kuala Lumpur to clarify about the deal. Abdullah agreed to the suggestion of Australian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Marise Payne, for an in-depth briefing over the matter. In response to the announcement of the agreement Malaysia's defence Minister proposed an immediate working trip to China to discuss AUKUS, as they wanted to get views of AUKUS from China's Leadership.\n* New Zealand \u2013 On 16 September 2021, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern issued a statement reiterating New Zealand's stance that no nuclear submarines were permitted in its waters, while also stating that they were not approached about the partnership and that she would not have expected them to have been approached. Ardern said the leaders of the three member states were \"very well versed\" in New Zealand's nuclear-free policy and would have \"understood our likely position on the establishment of nuclear-powered submarines\". Notably, Ardern was the first foreign politician that Morrison informed prior to the public announcement. Judith Collins, the leader of the National Party, expressed disappointment that New Zealand was not approached to join the partnership for the non-submarine co-operation areas.\n* Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) \u2013 The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement condemning the deal as \"extremely undesirable and dangerous\" which would \"upset the strategic balance in the Asia-Pacific region\", potentially destroying the nuclear non-proliferation system, and criticising the \"double-dealing\" of the US which \"seriously threatens the world peace and stability\" stating that North Korea will take counteraction if the alliance threatens the country.\n* Papua New Guinea \u2014 Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister stated that he wanted to protect the \"peace and serenity\" of the region and that \"as far as securing peace is concerned, we've got no problem, but if such activities bring disharmony in the region then we have an issue\".\n* Philippines \u2013 Through a statement released by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Philippines welcomed the signing of the trilateral security partnership. Foreign Secretary, Teodoro Locsin Jr. highlighted that \"the enhancement of a near-abroad ally's ability to project power should restore and keep the balance rather than destabilise it\", Secretary Locsin further added that without an actual presence of nuclear weapons within the region, the Philippines therefore finds that the AUKUS move would not constitute a violation of the 1995 Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone treaty.\n* Portugal \u2013 Portuguese Minister Augusto Santos Silva said \"In general, we ourselves express our solidarity with France, which has not been treated with due respect in this process\", adding that \"clearly, the form was not one that should have been followed\".\n* Russia \u2013 Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov expressed concern, stating \"This is a great challenge to the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.\" and that \"We are also concerned about the ... partnership that will allow Australia, after 18 months of consultations and several years of attempts, to obtain nuclear-powered submarines in sufficient numbers to become one of the top five countries for this type of armaments.\"\n* Singapore \u2013 Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong welcomed Australia's assurance that its new defence partnership with the US and the UK aims to promote a \"stable and secure\" Asia Pacific amid China's concerns.\n* Solomon Islands\u2014 Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said that he wanted to keep the region \"nuclear free\" and that he opposed \"any form of militarisation in our region that could threaten regional and international peace and stability\".\n* Taiwan \u2013 Vice President Lai Ching-te, immediately welcomed the partnership, referring to it \"as a positive development for democracy, peace, and prosperity in the region\". The foreign affairs spokesperson said, \"Taiwan, on the groundwork of the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Guarantees, will continue to deepen the close partnership with the United States, maintain the rules-based international order, and the peace, stability, and prosperity in the Taiwan Strait and in the Indo-Pacific region together.\" Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu also welcomed the partnership, stating \"We are pleased to see that the like-minded partners of Taiwan \u2014 the United States and the UK and Australia \u2014 are working closer with each other to acquire more advanced defence articles so that we can defend Indo-Pacific\".\n* **Others** \u2013 Morrison said he contacted prime ministers Yoshihide Suga of Japan, Narendra Modi of India, and Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore. South Korea has also remained silent."
