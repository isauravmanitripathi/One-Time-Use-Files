The CDB was\nestablished by an Agreement signed on October 18, 1969, in Kingston, Jamaica,\nwhich entered into force on January 26, 1970. The idea for the bank originated\nfrom the 1966 Canada/Commonwealth Caribbean Conference.\n\nThe permanent headquarters of the CDB is located in Wildey, St. Michael,\nBarbados, adjacent to the campus of the Samuel Jackman Prescod Polytechnic. On\nSeptember 21, 2018, the Bank officially opened its Country Office in Haiti,\nthe first outside its Headquarters in Barbados.

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Caribbean Development Bank was established by an agreement between sixteen\nmembers of the Commonwealth of Nations in the Caribbean region, along with\nCanada and the United Kingdom. Signed on October 18, 1969, in Kingston,\nJamaica, the Agreement entered into force on January 26, 1970 when 15 of the\n18 signing states ratified it. The bank's initial capital was 50 million USD,\nequivalent to 100 million Eastern Caribbean dollar, with main contributions\nfrom Jamaica (11,200,000 USD and 19.52% of votes), and the United Kingdom and\nCanada contributing 10,000,000 USD each with 17.55% of votes in bank.\n\nThe bank was created with the purpose of promoting sustainable economic growth\nand reducing poverty in the region, aligning with W. Arthur Lewis's vision of\neconomic development. During the first meeting of governors in Nassau, Lewis,\nwho was an economist, was appointed the first president of the Caribbean\nDevelopment Bank. His leadership was essential to establishing the bank's\noperations, emphasizing the importance of financial discipline and efficiency\nin development through agriculture and infrastructure projects. At this time,\nthe bank aimed to reduce economic disparities among its member states by using\nsoft loans to finance public works and agricultural development in the less\ndeveloped states.\n\nLewis set the CDB's independence up by retaliating against political\ninterference in the financial decisions of the bank. He also ensured there\nwould be efficient administration and a focus on the Caribbean states to\nbecome a key financial instrument for the countries that lacked access to\ninternational financial institutions. Lewis also played a key role in building\nstrong relationships with other international organizations like the Inter-\nAmerican Development Bank (IDB) and USAID that helped the bank gain legitimacy\nand credibility."
