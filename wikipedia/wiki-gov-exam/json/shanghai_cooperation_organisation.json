It was\nestablished in 2001 by the People's Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\nRussia, and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In June 2017, it expanded to eight\nstates, with India and Pakistan. Iran joined the group in July 2023, and\nBelarus in July 2024. Several countries are engaged as observers or dialogue\npartners.\n\nIt is the world's largest regional organization in terms of geographic scope\nand population, covering approximately 24% of the world's total area (65% of\nEurasia) and 42% of the world population. As of 2024, its combined nominal GDP\naccounts for around 23%, while its GDP based on PPP comprises approximately\n36% of the world's total.\n\nThe SCO is the successor to the **Shanghai Five** , formed in 1996 between\nChina, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. In June 2001, the\nleaders of these nations and Uzbekistan met in Shanghai to announce a new\norganization with deeper political and economic cooperation.\n\nThe SCO is governed by the Heads of State Council (HSC), its supreme decision\nmaking body, which meets once a year. The organization also contains the\nRegional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The United States applied for observer status in the SCO, but was rejected in\n2005.\n\nAt the Astana summit in July 2005, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\nforeshadowing an indefinite presence of U.S. forces in Uzbekistan and\nKyrgyzstan, the SCO requested the U.S. to set a clear timetable for\nwithdrawing its troops from SCO member states. Shortly afterwards, Uzbekistan\nrequested the U.S. leave the K2 air base.\n\nA report in 2007 noted that the SCO has made no direct comments against the\nU.S. or its military presence in the region; however, some indirect statements\nat the past summits have been viewed by Western media outlets as \"thinly\nveiled swipes at Washington\".\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008, the Western reaction to the SCO was generally skepticism of\nthe organization's goals. By the 2010s, however, the West increasingly began\nto view the SCO as a potential contributor to stability in the region,\nparticularly with regards to Afghanistan.\n\nIn September 2023, the United Nations approved United Nations resolution\nA/77/L.107, titled \"Cooperation between the United Nations and the Shanghai\nCooperation Organization.\" The result of the vote was 80 in favour to 2\nagainst with 47 abstentions. The United States and Israel were the only\ncountries to vote against the resolution.\n\nAlthough the European Council on Foreign Relations dubbed the SCO an \"anti\nNATO alliance\" in 2022, apparent inconsistencies among its member states have\nprevented it from becoming an effective geopolitical alliance. As of July\n2023, India and Central Asian countries maintained friendly cooperation with\nboth the West and Russia, India has had fierce conflicts with Pakistan and its\nally China at the same time, which has been limiting the possibility of China\nand Russia forming the group into an anti-Western bloc. Academics Simon Curtis\nand Ian Klaus write that although SCO has sometimes been compared to NATO,\nunlike NATO, SCO does not create a collective security alliance."

        "generated_section_content_md": "SCO summit in Ufa, Russia in 2015 SCO and NATO Member States\n\nAt a 2005 summit in Kazakhstan the SCO issued a Declaration of Heads of Member\nStates of the SCO which said: \"The heads of the member states point out that,\nagainst the backdrop of a contradictory process of globalisation, multilateral\ncooperation, which is based on the principles of equal right and mutual\nrespect, non-intervention in internal affairs of sovereign states, non-\nconfrontational way of thinking and consecutive movement towards\ndemocratisation of international relations, contributes to overall peace and\nsecurity, and call upon the international community, irrespective of its\ndifferences in ideology and social structure, to form a new concept of\nsecurity based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and interaction.\"\n\nIn November 2005 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that the\n\"Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is working to establish a rational\nand just world order\" and that \"The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation provides\nus with a unique opportunity to take part in the process of forming a\nfundamentally new model of geopolitical integration\".\n\nIn 2007, Matthew Brummer tracked the implications of SCO expansion into the\nPersian Gulf.[_full citation needed_] In 2008, one aim of SCO was to ensure\nthat liberal democracy could not gain ground in these countries, according to\npolitical scientist Thomas Ambrosio. In 2016, political scientist Thomas\nFingar wrote that China took the lead in establishing the Shanghai Five\nprimarily to limit Russia's ability to reassert its influence in Central Asia.\n\nDuring the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, China opposed Russia's infringement on\nGeorgia's sovereignty. Citing principles of sovereignty, territorial\nintegrity, and global order, China used its influence in the SCO to prevent\nthe organization from supporting Russia.\n\nIn 2008, Iranian writer Hamid Golpira had this to say on the topic: \"According\nto Zbigniew Brzezinski's theory, control of the Eurasian landmass is the key\nto global domination and control of Central Asia is the key to control of the\nEurasian landmass....Russia and China have been paying attention to\nBrzezinski's theory, since they formed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation\nin 2001, ostensibly to curb extremism in the region and enhance border\nsecurity, but most probably with the real objective of counterbalancing the\nactivities of the United States and the rest of the NATO alliance in Central\nAsia\".\n\nIn 2008, the _People's Daily_ wrote: \"The Declaration points out that the SCO\nmember countries have the ability and responsibility to safeguard the security\nof the Central Asian region, and calls on Western countries to leave Central\nAsia. That is the most noticeable signal given by the Summit to the world\".\n\nIn January 2023, India as SCO chair, invited Pakistan's Foreign Affairs\nMinister and Chief justice to attend a meeting in Goa in May 2023. As of May\n2023, India and Pakistan continued to spar over terrorism, while Central Asian\nmembers Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have erupted in armed conflict over border\ndisputes. The SCO was not a platform for resolving bilateral issues, and its\nmembers were also reluctant to mediate disputes multilaterally. Due to the\nwidely divergent agendas among member states, Indian commentators even called\nit the \"Shanghai Contradiction Organisation\".\n\nMembers of the SCO remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian war, they also\nstrengthened cooperation with the Russian Federation. Analysis in 2024 points\nout that the SCO has generally facilitated amicable China-Russia relations.\n\nIn June 2025, India refused to endorse a joint statement at the Shanghai\nCooperation Organisation (SCO) defense ministers\u2019 meeting in Qingdao, China,\nciting concerns that it did not reflect its position on terrorism. India\nobjected to the omission of the 22 April 2025 Pahalgam attack, in which 26\nIndian tourists were killed, while the statement referenced militant activity\nin Balochistan. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh argued that the statement\naligned with Pakistan\u2019s narrative and urged the SCO to hold accountable those\nwho use \u201ccross-border terrorism as an instrument of policy.\u201d India maintained\nthat such omissions made the statement unacceptable. India\u2019s foreign ministry\nspokesman Randhir Jaiswal expressed that India wanted \u201cconcerns on terrorism\nto be reflected in the SCO document, which was not acceptable to one\nparticular country, and therefore the statement was not adopted.\u201d\nSubsequently, at the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting on 15 July\n2025, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar described the Pahalgam\nattack as a deliberate attempt to undermine Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s tourism and\nincite religious division. He emphasized the need for the SCO to uphold its\nfounding principles by maintaining an uncompromising stance against terrorism,\nseparatism, and extremism.\n\nIn July 2025, Minister Jaishankar also raised concerns over China\u2019s\nconstruction of the Medog Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River. He\nemphasized the potential downstream impacts on water security and ecological\nstability, and called for greater transparency, meaningful consultation with\naffected countries, and the resumption of suspended hydrological data sharing."
