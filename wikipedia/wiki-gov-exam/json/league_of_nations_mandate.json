These mandates served as legal documents\nestablishing the internationally agreed terms for administering the territory\non behalf of the League of Nations. Combining elements of both a treaty and a\nconstitution, these mandates contained minority rights clauses that provided\nfor the rights of petition and adjudication by the Permanent Court of\nInternational Justice.\n\nThe mandate system was established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the\nLeague of Nations, entered into force on 28 June 1919. With the dissolution of\nthe League of Nations after World War II, it was stipulated at the Yalta\nConference that the remaining mandates should be placed under the trusteeship\nof the United Nations, subject to future discussions and formal agreements.\nMost of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of\nSouth West Africa) thus eventually became United Nations trust territories.\n\nTwo governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-\nannexation of the territory and its administration as a \"sacred trust of\ncivilisation\" to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.\n\nAccording to historian Susan Pedersen, colonial administration in the mandates\ndid not differ substantially from colonial administration elsewhere. Even\nthough the Covenant of the League committed the great powers to govern the\nmandates differently, the main difference appeared to be that the colonial\npowers spoke differently about the mandates than their other colonial\npossessions."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The mandate system was established by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League\nof Nations, drafted by the victors of World War I. The article referred to\nterritories which after the war were no longer ruled by their previous\nsovereign, but their peoples were not considered \"able to stand by themselves\nunder the strenuous conditions of the modern world\". The article called for\nsuch people's tutelage to be \"entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of\ntheir resources, their experience or their geographical position can best\nundertake this responsibility\".\n\nU.S. President Woodrow Wilson and South African General Jan Smuts played\ninfluential roles in pushing for the establishment of a mandates system. The\nmandates system reflected a compromise between Smuts (who wanted colonial\npowers to annex the territories) and Wilson (who wanted trusteeship over the\nterritories)."

The mandates were fundamentally different from the\nprotectorates in that the mandatory power undertook obligations to the\ninhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations.\n\nThe process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases:\n\n1. The formal removal of sovereignty of the state previously controlling the territory.\n2. The transfer of mandatory powers to individual states among the Allied Powers."

A United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine for peacefully dividing the remainder of the Mandate failed. The Mandate terminated at midnight between 14 May and 15 May 1948. On the evening of 14 May, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine had declared the establishment of the State of Israel. Following the war, 75% of the area was controlled by the new State of Israel.

From 1 March 1926 to 30 June 1960, Ruanda-Urundi was in administrative union with the neighbouring colony of the Belgian Congo. After 13 December 1946, it became a United Nations trust territory, remaining under Belgian administration until the separate nations of Rwanda and Burundi gained independence on 1 July 1962. | Rwanda\nBurundi |\nBritish Mandate for East Africa | Tanganyika Territory | United Kingdom | From 20 July 1922 to 11 December 1946. It became a United Nations trust territory on 11 December 1946, and was granted internal self-rule on 1 May 1961. On 9 December 1961, it became independent while retaining the British monarch as nominal head of state, transforming into a republic on the same day the next year.

The Treaty of Versailles provisionally\nrecognised the former Ottoman communities as independent nations. It also\nrequired Germany to recognise the disposition of the former Ottoman\nterritories and to recognise the new states laid down within their boundaries.\nThe terms of the Treaty of Lausanne required the newly created states that\nacquired the territory detached from the Ottoman Empire to pay annuities on\nthe Ottoman public debt and to assume responsibility for the administration of\nconcessions that had been granted by the Ottomans. The treaty also let the\nStates acquire, without payment, all the property and possessions of the\nOttoman Empire situated within their territory. The treaty provided that the\nLeague of Nations was responsible for establishing an arbitral court to\nresolve disputes that might arise and stipulated that its decisions were\nfinal.\n\nA disagreement regarding the legal status and the portion of the annuities to\nbe paid by the \"A\" mandates was settled when an Arbitrator ruled that some of\nthe mandates contained more than one State:\n\n> The difficulty arises here how one is to regard the Asiatic countries under\n> the British and French mandates. Iraq is a Kingdom in regard to which Great\n> Britain has undertaken responsibilities equivalent to those of a Mandatory\n> Power. Under the British mandate, Palestine and Transjordan have each an\n> entirely separate organisation.

In each case, the colonial power\nthat held the mandate on each territory became the administering power of the\ntrusteeship, except that of the Empire of Japan, which had been defeated in\nWorld War II, lost its mandate over the South Pacific islands, which became a\n\"strategic trust territory\" known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific\nIslands under U.S. administration.\n\nThe sole exception to the transformation of the League of Nations mandates\ninto UN trusteeships was that of South Africa and its mandated territory South\nWest Africa. Rather than placing South West Africa under trusteeship like\nother former mandates, South Africa proposed annexation, a proposition\nrejected by the UN General Assembly. Despite South Africa's resistance, the\nInternational Court of Justice affirmed that South Africa continued to have\ninternational obligations regarding the South West Africa mandate. Eventually,\nin 1990, the mandated territory, now Namibia, gained independence, culminating\nfrom the Tripartite Accords and the resolution of the South African Border War\n\u2014 a prolonged guerrilla conflict against the apartheid regime that lasted from\n1966 until 1990.\n\nNearly all the former League of Nations mandates had become sovereign states\nby 1990, including all of the former UN trust territories with the exception\nof a few successor entities of the gradually dismembered Trust Territory of\nthe Pacific Islands (formerly Japan's South Pacific Trust Mandate). These\nexceptions include the Northern Mariana Islands which is a commonwealth in\npolitical union with the U.S. with the status of unincorporated organised\nterritory. The Northern Mariana Islands does elect its own governor to serve\nas territorial head of government, but it remains a U.S. territory with its\nhead of state being the President of the United States and federal funds to\nthe commonwealth administered by the Office of Insular Affairs of the U.S.\nDepartment of the Interior.\n\nRemnant Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, the heirs of the last territories\nof the Trust, attained final independence on 22 December 1990. (The UN\nSecurity Council ratified termination of trusteeship, effectively dissolving\ntrusteeship status, on 10 July 1987.) The Republic of Palau, split off from\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, became the last to effectively gain its\nindependence, on 1 October 1994."
