        "generated_section_content_md": "At a summit meeting in December 1981, the leaders of the Customs and Economic\nUnion of Central Africa (French acronym UDEAC) agreed in principle to form a\nwider economic community of Central African states. ECCAS was established on\n18 October 1983 by the UDEAC members, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe and the members of\nthe Economic Community of the Great Lakes States (CEPGL established in 1976 by\nthe DR Congo, Burundi and Rwanda). Angola remained an observer until 1999,\nwhen it became a full member.\n\nECCAS began functioning in 1985, but was inactive for several years because of\nfinancial difficulties (non-payment of membership fees by the member states)\nand the conflict in the Great Lakes area. The war in the DR Congo was\nparticularly divisive, as Rwanda and Angola fought on opposing sides. ECCAS\nhas been designated a pillar of the African Economic Community (AEC), but\nformal contact between the AEC and ECCAS was only established in October 1999\ndue to the inactivity of ECCAS since 1992 (ECCAS signed the Protocol on\nRelations between the AEC and the regional blocs (RECs) in October 1999). The\nAEC again confirmed the importance of ECCAS as the major economic community in\nCentral Africa at the third preparatory meeting of its Economic and Social\nCouncil (ECOSOC) in June 1999.\n\nPresided over by President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, the summit was held in\nLibreville on 6 February 1998. The Heads of State and Government present at\nthe summit committed themselves to the resurrection of the organisation. The\nPrime Minister of Angola also indicated that his country would become a fully\nfledged member. The summit approved a budget of 10 million French francs for\n1998 and requested the Secretariat to:\n\n* Obtain assistance from UNECA to evaluate the operational activities of the secretariat; to evaluate the contributions due by member states; and the salaries and salary structures of employees of the secretariat\n* Convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Ministers as soon as possible to evaluate the recommendations of UNECA; the Council should then draw up proposals for a new administrative structure for the secretariat and revised contributions due by each member state.\n\nThe summit also requested countries in the region to find lasting and peaceful\nsolutions to their political problems. The chairman also appealed to member\ncountries to support the complete lifting of the embargo placed on his\ncountry. During the inauguration of President Bongo of Gabon on 21 January\n1999, a mini-summit of ECCAS leaders was held. The leaders discussed problems\nconcerning the functioning of ECCAS and the creation of a third Deputy\nSecretary-General post, designated for Angola. Angola formally joined the\nCommunity during this summit."

This Summit decided to adopt a protocol on the\nestablishment of a Network of Parliamentarians of Central Africa (REPAC) and\nto adopt the standing orders of the Council for Peace and Security in Central\nAfrica (COPAX), including the Defence and Security Commission (CDS),\nMultinational Force of Central Africa (FOMAC) and the Early Warning Mechanism\nof Central Africa (MARAC). Rwanda was also officially welcomed upon its return\nas a full member of ECCAS.\n\nOn January 24, 2003, the European Union (EU) concluded a financial agreement\nwith ECCAS and CEMAC, conditional on ECCAS and CEMAC merging into one\norganization, with ECCAS taking responsibility for the peace and security of\nthe sub-region through its security pact COPAX. CEMAC is not one of the\npillars of the African Economic Community, but its members are associated with\nit through Economic Community of Central African States. The EU had multiple\npeacekeeping missions in the DR Congo: Operation Artemis (June to September\n2003), EUPOL Kinshasa (from October 2003) and EUSEC DR Congo (from May 2005).\n\nThe 11th Ordinary Session of Heads of State and Government in Brazzaville\nduring January 2004 welcomed the fact that the Protocol Relating to the\nEstablishment of a Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa (COPAX)\nhad received the required number of ratifications to enter into force. The\nSummit also adopted a declaration on the implementation of NEPAD in Central\nAfrica as well as a declaration on gender equality.\n\nOn September 23, 2009, pursuant to Presidential Determination 2009-26 and as\npublished in the Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 183 (Presidential Documents\n48363) ECCAS was made eligible under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act for the\nfurnishing of defense articles and defense services. This makes the ECCAS\norganization and (theoretically) the countries under their charter eligible\nfor U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program (i.e. government to government sales\nand assistance) pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act and for other such\nU.S. assistance as directed by a USG contract to U.S. industry for such\nsupport pursuant to the (ITAR)[1].\n\nIn 2007, Rwanda decided to leave the organisation in order to remove overlap\nin its membership in regional trade blocks and so that it could better focus\non its membership in the EAC and COMESA. Rwanda was a founding member of the\norganisation and had been a part of it since 18 October 1981. It subsequently\nrejoined ECCAS in 2016. On 1 September 2020, Gilberto Da Piedade Verissimo of\nAngola was appointed President of the ECCAS Commission with Francisca\nTatchouop Belobe as vice-President.\n\nIn response to the 2023 Gabonese coup d'\u00e9tat, the ECCAS condemned the military\nuse of force and asked for restoration of constitutional order. It also\nsuspended Gabon's membership in the bloc on 5 September and moved its\nheadquarters from Libreville to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.\n\nOn 7 June 2025, Rwanda announced its departure from the ECCAS, citing the\nbloc's \"instrumentalisation\" by the Democratic Republic of the Congo."
