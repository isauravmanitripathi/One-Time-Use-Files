The Arab League was formed in Cairo\non 22 March 1945, initially with seven members: Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan,\nLebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and North Yemen. Currently, the League has 22\nmembers.\n\nThe League's main goal is to \"draw closer the relations between member states\nand co-ordinate collaboration between them, to safeguard their independence\nand sovereignty, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of\nthe Arab countries\". The organization has received a relatively low level of\ncooperation throughout its history.\n\nThrough institutions, notably the Arab League Educational, Cultural and\nScientific Organization (ALECSO) and the Economic and Social Council of its\nCouncil of Arab Economic Unity (CAEU), the League facilitates political,\neconomic, cultural, scientific, and social programmes designed to promote the\ninterests of the Arab world. It has served as a forum for the member states to\ncoordinate policy, arrange studies of and committees as to matters of common\nconcern, settle inter-state disputes and limit conflicts such as the 1958\nLebanon crisis. The League has served as a platform for the drafting and\nconclusion of many landmark documents promoting economic integration. One\nexample is the Joint Arab Economic Action Charter, which outlines the\nprinciples for economic activities in the region.\n\nEach member state has one vote in the Council of the Arab League, and\ndecisions are binding only for those states that have voted for them. The aims\nof the league in 1945 were to strengthen and coordinate the political,\ncultural, economic and social programs of its members and to mediate disputes\namong them or between them and third parties. Furthermore, the signing of an\nagreement on _Joint Defence and Economic Cooperation_ on 13 April 1950\ncommitted the signatories to coordination of military defence measures. In\nMarch 2015, the Arab League General Secretary announced the establishment of a\nJoint Arab Force with the aim of counteracting extremism and other threats to\nthe Arab States. The decision was reached while Operation Decisive Storm was\nintensifying in Yemen. Participation in the project is voluntary, and the army\nintervenes only at the request of one of the member states. Existing military\ncooperation between Arab league states and regional civil wars and terrorist\nthreats were the impetuses for JAF's establishment.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Economic Council put forward a proposal to create the\nJoint Arab Chambers of Commerce across international states. That led to the\nsetting up of mandates to promote, encourage and facilitate bilateral trade\nbetween the Arab world and significant trading partners."

The official headquarters of the League was the\nBoustan Palace in Cairo. It aimed to be a regional organisation of Arab states\nwith a focus to developing the economy, resolving disputes and coordinating\npolitical aims. Other countries later joined the league. Each country was\ngiven one vote in the council. The first major action was joint intervention\nto keep Palestine from being divided into two states in keeping with the\ndecision of the United Nations General Assembly. When Transjordan agreed to\nthis proposal, Egypt intervened to prevent this from happening. It was\nfollowed by the creation of a mutual defence treaty two years later. A common\nmarket was established in 1965.\n\nArab League of states establishment memorial stamp.

On 6 March 2013, the Arab League gave Syria's seat in\nthe Arab League to the Syrian National Coalition, the largest opposition\ngroup. On 9 March 2014, secretary general Nabil Elaraby stated that Syria's\nseat would remain vacant until the opposition completed the formation of its\ninstitutions.

It possesses elements of a state representative\nparliament while foreign affairs are often conducted under UN supervision.\n\nThe Charter of the Arab League endorsed the principle of an Arab nation-state\nwhile respecting the sovereignty of the individual member states. The internal\nregulations of the Council of the League and the committees were agreed in\nOctober 1951. Those of the Secretariat-General were agreed in May 1953.\n\nSince then, governance of the Arab League has been based on the duality of\nsupra-national institutions and the sovereignty of the member states.\nPreservation of individual statehood derived its strengths from the natural\npreference of ruling elites to maintain their power and independence in\ndecision making. Moreover, the fear of the richer that the poorer may share\ntheir wealth in the name of Arab nationalism, the feuds among Arab rulers, and\nthe influence of external powers that might oppose Arab unity can be seen as\nobstacles towards a deeper integration of the league.\n\nMindful of their previous announcements in support of the Arabs of Palestine\nthe framers of the Pact were determined to include them within the League from\nits inauguration. This was done by means of an annex that declared:\n\n> Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the\n> basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League\n> of Nations determined a system of government for her. Her existence and her\n> independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned _de\n> jure_ than the independence of any of the other Arab States. [...]\n> Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that\n> in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League\n> should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work\n> until this country enjoys actual independence\n\nIn September 1963, the Arab League appointed Ahmad Shukeiri as Representative\nof Palestine at the Arab League. At the Cairo Summit of 1964, the Arab League\ninitiated the creation of an organisation representing the Palestinian people.\nThe first Palestinian National Council convened in East Jerusalem on 29 May\n1964. The Palestine Liberation Organization was founded during this meeting on\n2 June 1964. Palestine was shortly admitted in to the Arab League, represented\nby the PLO. Today, State of Palestine is a full member of the Arab League.\n\nAt the Beirut Summit on 28 March 2002, the league adopted the Arab Peace\nInitiative, a Saudi-inspired peace plan for the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict. The\ninitiative offered full normalisation of the relations with Israel. In\nexchange, Israel was required to withdraw from all occupied territories,\nincluding the Golan Heights, to recognise Palestinian independence in the West\nBank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as a \"just\nsolution\" for the Palestinian refugees. The Peace Initiative was again\nendorsed at 2007 in the Riyadh Summit. In July 2007, the Arab League sent a\nmission, consisting of the Jordanian and Egyptian foreign ministers, to Israel\nto promote the initiative. Following Venezuela's move to expel Israeli\ndiplomats amid the 2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, Kuwaiti member of\nparliament Waleed Al-Tabtabaie proposed moving Arab League headquarters to\nCaracas, Venezuela. On 13 June 2010, Amr Mohammed Moussa, Secretary-General of\nthe Arab League, visited the Gaza Strip, the first visit by an official of the\nArab League since Hamas' armed takeover in 2007.\n\nThe Arab League is a member of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum\n(CASCF), which was formed in 2004. CASCF is the Arab League's earliest\nparticipation in a cooperation forum with another country or region. CASCF is\nthe primarily multi-lateral coordination mechanism between the Arab states and\nChina and within CASCF the Arab League represents its member states as a\nrelatively unified force. The Arab League's coordination allows Arab states to\nnegotiate actively for collective projects involving multiple states, such as\nrailway projects, nuclear power projects, and Dead Sea initiatives.\n\nIn 2015, the Arab League voiced support for Saudi Arabian-led military\nintervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former\nPresident Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising.\n\nOn 15 April 2018, in response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed\nat ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, the Arab League\npassed a resolution calling on Turkish forces to withdraw from Afrin.\n\nIn September 2019, the Arab League condemned Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to\nannex the eastern portion of the occupied West Bank known as the Jordan\nValley.\n\nThe Arab League met in Cairo on 12 October 2019 to discuss Turkish offensive\ninto north-eastern Syria. Upon meeting, its member states voted to condemn the\nTurkish offensive, dubbing it both an 'invasion' and an 'aggression' against\nan Arab state, adding that the organization saw it as a violation of\ninternational law.\n\nOn 9 September 2020, the Arab League refused to condemn the UAE's decision to\nnormalize ties with Israel. Nevertheless, \"The goal all our Arab countries\nseek, without exception, is to end the occupation and establish an independent\nPalestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital,\"\nAboul Gheit said. In January 2024, the Arab League expressed support for South\nAfrica's ICJ genocide case against Israel."

Another part of the League is the Nile Valley, made up of\nEgypt and Sudan. These two member states have started to improve the River\nNile's navigation system to improve accessibility and thus foster trading. A\nnew railway system is also set to connect the southern Egyptian city of Abu\nSimbel with the northern Sudanese city of Wadi Halfa and then to Khartoum and\nPort Sudan. The third division of the League is the Maghreb, where a 3,000 km\nstretch of railway runs from the southern cities of Morocco to Tripoli in\nWestern Libya. The fourth division of the League is the Horn of Africa, whose\nmember states include Djibouti and Somalia. These two Arab League states are\nseparated by only ten nautical miles from the Arabian Peninsula by the Bab el\nMandeb and this is quickly changing as Tarik bin Laden, the brother of Osama\nbin Laden, has initiated the construction of the ambitious Bridge of the Horns\nproject, which ultimately aims to connect the Horn of Africa with the Arabian\nPeninsula via a massive bridge. The project is intended to facilitate and\naccelerate the already centuries-old trade and commerce between the two\nregions. The last division of the League is the isolated archipelago of the\nComoros located off the coast of East Africa, which is not physically\nconnected to any other Arab state, but still trades with other Arab League\nmembers."
