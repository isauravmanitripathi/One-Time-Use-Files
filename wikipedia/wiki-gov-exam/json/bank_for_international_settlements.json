Its primary goal\nis to foster international monetary and financial cooperation while serving as\na bank for central banks. With its establishment in 1930 it is the oldest\ninternational financial institution. Its initial purpose was to oversee the\nsettlement of World War I war reparations.\n\nThe BIS carries out its work through its meetings, programmes and through the\nBasel Process, hosting international groups pursuing global financial\nstability and facilitating their interaction. It also provides banking\nservices, but only to central banks and other international organizations.\n\nThe BIS is based in Basel, Switzerland, with representative offices in Hong\nKong and Mexico City."

An early case was a \u00a3400,000 loan in gold coins,\nin 1825 and facilitated by the Rothschilds, from the Bank of France to the\nBank of England, which was facing a bank run. The Bank of England again\nborrowed from its French counterpart (and from the Hamburger Bank) in 1836 and\n1839, and lent to it in return in 1847.\n\nIn 1860\u20131861, because of the disruption from the incipient American Civil War,\nthe Bank of France entered a series of swap agreements in specie with the Bank\nof England as well as the State Bank of the Russian Empire and De\nNederlandsche Bank. That episode was recorded as the \"war of the banks\",\nostensibly because of friction between the Bank of France and the Bank of\nEngland about the transaction.\n\nA few years later, monetary cooperation took a novel form with a series of\ninternational monetary conferences devoted to better coordination of the\ncoinage system, even though these initiatives, like the Latin Monetary Union\nstarted in 1865, did not extend to money other than coins, and therefore\ninvolved treasury and mint officials rather than bankers.\n\nAt the Brussels Conference in 1892, German academic Julius Wolff submitted a\nblueprint for an international currency that would be used for emergency\nlending to national central banks and would be issued by an institution based\nin a neutral country. In 1893, French economist Rapha\u00ebl-Georges L\u00e9vy suggested\nthe establishment of an international central bank in Bern.\n\nIn 1907, Italian statesman Luigi Luzzatti published an article in the Austrian\nNeue Freie Presse, referencing past examples of bilateral cooperation between\ncentral banks and emphasizing the need for more institutionalized cooperation\nat the international level.\n\nThe practice of formalized central bank cooperation made unprecedented\nadvances among allies in the course of World War I. In 1916, the Bank of\nEngland and Bank of France made agreements on bilateral lending and\nestablished a direct telegraph line between their respective offices to\nfacilitate communication. Similar formal agreements were made that year\nbetween those two banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and in 1917\nthe Bank of Italy opened an office in New York.\n\nIn the war's immediate aftermath, Dutch central banker Gerard Vissering\nadvocated an international currency without reliance on a common gold pool.\nSimilar ideas burgeoned at the Brussels Conference of 1920, the first major\ndiscussion of international financial challenges following the war, endorsed\nby luminaries such as Belgian prime minister L\u00e9on Delacroix and American\nbanker Frank A. Vanderlip, who suggested reorganizing Europe's national\ncentral banks along similar lines to the U.S. Federal Reserve which he had\nhelped establish in the previous decade. At the Genoa Conference of 1922,\nfollowing advocacy by several experts that included Ralph Hawtrey, Robert\nHorne and John Maynard Keynes, a resolution was passed that recommended the\ncreation of \"an association or permanent understanding for cooperation amongst\ncentral banks, not necessarily limited to Europe, to coordinate credit\npolicies, without detriment to the freedom of each individual central bank.\"\n\nIt was decided to create the BIS in the context of negotiations over World War\nI reparations which plagued international relations in Europe throughout the\n1920s. Following the Treaty of Versailles, a Reparation Commission was set up\nin January 1920 to determine the amount of German reparations. Conferences at\nSpa in July 1920 and London in March 1921 were followed by the occupation of\nthe Ruhr in January 1923, and eventually the Dawes Plan approved at another\nLondon conference in July\u2013August 1924. The Dawes Plan allowed for a more\nconstructive atmosphere, materialized in diplomacy by the Locarno Treaties in\nOctober 1925 and encouraging Montagu Norman, the influential governor of the\nBank of England, to envisage the creation of what he described in September\n1925 as \"a private and eclectic Central Banks' 'Club', small at first, larger\nin the future.\" That vision was first materialized at a meeting in early July\n1927 which brought together Montagu, his friend Benjamin Strong, head of the\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York, Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht, and\nBank of France vice governor Charles Rist at a private home on Long Island\n(the Bank of Italy had hoped for an invitation but was not included). A second\nmeeting was scheduled in Algeciras, but was not held because of the bad health\nof Strong, who eventually died in October 1928."

Young (1874\u20131962) played a central role in the\nconception and establishment of the BIS in 1929\u20131930 H\u00f4tel St\u00e9phanie in Baden-\nBaden (demolished in 1964), where the charter and statutes of the BIS were\ndrafted\n\nA deadline for French repayment of its bilateral debt to the United States\nprovided impetus for a new initiative, which took the form of a Committee of\nExperts appointed to work out a final settlement of the German reparations,\nknown as the Young Committee for its chairman the American banker Owen D.\nYoung. The committee first met at the Bank of France on 9 February 1929, then\nin 28 successive sessions ending on 7 June 1929 at the Hotel George V. The\nseven participating countries were Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States. The need for a jointly governed bank\nemerged in these discussions as a means to overcome information asymmetries\nand increase the likelihood that commitments would be effectively met, not\nleast by helping the creditors to act collectively and facilitating the\nreinvestment of German payments into the German economy. The first draft\nconcept for the new bank was presented by Belgian banker \u00c9mile Francqui on 23\nFebruary 1929, and amended with suggestions from Bank of France governor \u00c9mile\nMoreau. It was envisaged as a private institution with shareholders from all\nparticipating countries (including Germany) that would settle reparation\npayments, issue bonds to be serviced by the reparation transfers, and (as\nadvocated by Schacht) provide international long-term credit for countries in\nneed, including Germany. In a memo to Young a few days later, Schacht first\nused the name \"International Settlements Bank\" while referring to the\nprojected new institution. Young asked his American peers Warren Randolph\nBurgess, Shepard Morgan and Walter W. Stewart to sail promptly to Paris, and\non 7 March 1929 they presented a compromise text that formed the basis for\nsubsequent developments.\n\nUnder the Young Committee's consensus concept, made public on 10 March 1929,\nthe bank would serve a threefold purpose as a trustee, bank, and international\norganization of central bankers:\n\n1. receiving, managing, and distributing German reparation annuities as a trustee;\n2. facilitating German transfers by issuing counterpart bills, notes, and bonds; and\n3. serving national central banks by taking their deposits, granting them credit, and carrying out currency and gold transactions on their behalf.\n\nIt would rely on nonpolitical staff located in a country not directly involved\nin the reparations disputes. Subsequent fine-tuning discussions revolved\naround the scope for the bank's lending to foster economic growth and trade,\nwhich would have given it a role similar to that of the later World Bank. Such\na role was advocated by Schacht but opposed by France and by commercial\nbankers, on the grounds that it could be inflationary and create unfair\ncompetition to private-sector lenders. An overall agreement on the future\nbank, with draft statutes prepared by the Bank of England's Charles Stewart\nAddis, was achieved by the Young Committee on 25 March 1929.\n\nPolitical positions within the Herbert Hoover administration made it\nimpossible for U.S. Federal Reserve System officials to be formally involved\nin the initiative, but the U.S. was still able to retain major influence in\nthe proceedings because of a shared perception amongst negotiators that the\nproject would fail without U.S. participation. Major figures of the U.S.\nfinancial world would participate in the joint bank, and act in close\ncooperation with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The leverage held by\nthe U.S. allowed Young and J. P. Morgan Jr. to make sure that Americans would\nbe in leadership position at the bank when it started operations, as indeed\nhappened.\n\nThe BIS concept was agreed to in August 1929 at the first part of the Hague\nconference on reparations. The bank's Charter, Statutes, Trust Agreement, and\nConvention on its relations with the host country were subsequently drafted by\na special Organisation Committee chaired by Jackson Reynolds, president of the\nFirst National Bank of New York, which met in the discreet location of H\u00f4tel\nSt\u00e9phanie (part of which later became Brenners Park-Hotel & Spa [de]) at\nBaden-Baden from 3 October to 13 November 1929; the intense work was marred by\nthe death of Delacroix from a heart attack during the proceedings. Aside from\nReynolds, American participants in Baden-baden also included Melvin Alvah\nTraylor, president of the First National Bank of Chicago, Warren Randolph\nBurgess, Shepard Morgan, and Leon Fraser [de] (a legal expert with the Agent\nGeneral for Reparation Payments), with J. P. Morgan Jr. monitoring the\nproceedings and advising from London.\n\nAs in the Paris discussions earlier in the year, the Baden-Baden committee had\nto reconcile the different visions for the future BIS, from purely a creation\nof central banks (as espoused by Italy's Alberto Beneduce and by Montagu\nNorman) to a supranational development bank with policy tasks such as\ndeveloping world trade (as advocated by Schacht and UK Chancellor Philip\nSnowden). Other points of contention included the future institution's\nofficial language(s), for which the committee endorsed French, and location.\nFor the latter, several delegates favored London, but that was vetoed by the\nFrench who proposed Brussels instead, which in turn was vetoed by the British;\nafter Amsterdam failed to gain sufficient support, a consensus was eventually\nfound on Basel, which combined neutral country status and good railway\nconnections. The founding texts of the BIS were then approved at the second\npart of the Hague conference, on 20 January 1930, with only minor changes from\nthe Baden-Baden drafts such as the addition of English to French as official\nlanguage. These texts included the constituent Charter and Statutes for the\nbank, and a Convention (intergovernmental agreement) between Germany, Belgium,\nFrance, the United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, the United States, and Switzerland,\nestablishing the bank's special status on Swiss soil and committing\nSwitzerland to grant the Charter and approve the Statutes."

The governors met that day and the\nnext to formally approve and sign the statutes in Rome, out of consideration\nfor the Bank of Italy's governor Bonaldo Stringher who was both the most\nsenior in the group, and in poor health (he would pass away in December 1930).\nAside from Stringher, who chaired the meeting, the other participants were:\nVincenzo Azzolini and Alberto Beneduce, for Italy; Bank of England governor\nMontagu Norman and Harry Arthur Siepmann, for the UK; Bank of France governor\n\u00c9mile Moreau, Cl\u00e9ment Moret [fr] and Pierre Quesnay, for France; Reichsbank\ngovernor Schacht, for Germany; National Bank of Belgium governor Louis Franck\nand Paul van Zeeland, for Belgium; and the Bank of Japan's London\nrepresentative Tetsuzaburo Tanaka [ja] and diplomat Hiroshi Saito, for Japan.\nThus the BIS was formally created in Rome on 27 February 1930. The BIS\npromptly opened its doors in Basel on 17 May 1930, ahead of the first German\nannuities under the Young Plan due in June.\n\nThe legal status of the bank combined features of a private-sector company and\nof a public international organization. It was a limited-liability company\nincorporated under Swiss law, whose shares could be held by individuals and\nnon-governmental entities. However, the rights of voting and representation at\nthe Bank's General Meeting were to be exercised exclusively by the central\nbanks of the countries in which shares had been issued. At the same time, the\nBIS possessed _de facto_ international legal personality, was exempted from\nSwiss taxation and banking supervision, and its senior management enjoyed\ndiplomatic status. The Charter stipulated that \"The Bank, its property and\nassets and all deposits and other funds entrusted to it shall be immune in\ntime of peace and in time of war from any measure such as expropriation,\nrequisition, seizure, confiscation, prohibition or restriction of gold or\ncurrency export or import, and any other similar measures.\" Under the\nStatutes, the governor of each of the founding central banks was a member of\nthe BIS Board of Directors _ex officio_ , and had the right to appoint a\nsecond Board member, plus additional right for France and Germany to appoint a\nthird Board member each or the duration of the Young Plan. In principle the\nBoard could appoint up to nine additional directors, in practice however only\nthe Dutch, Swedish and Swiss central bank governors in the BIS's first\ndecades. The inaugural BIS Board had 16 members: Franck and Francqui\n(Belgium); Moreau, Georges Brincard [fr] and Melchior de Vog\u00fc\u00e9 [fr] (France);\nHans Luther, Carl Melchior and Paul Reusch [de] (Germany); Stringher and\nBeneduce (Italy); Tanaka and Daisuke Nohara (Japan); Norman and Addis (UK);\nand Gates McGarrah and Fraser (United States)."

Even before the founding\nmeeting in Rome, the Organisation Committee had secured a two-year lease of a\nconvenient building in Basel, the former _Grand H\u00f4tel et Savoy H\u00f4tel Univers_\nacross the street from Basel railway station. By mid-April, Fraser had arrived\nfrom the United States and was working on the BIS's behalf from the Paris\noffice of the Agent General for Reparation Payments, joined by McGarrah in\nApril. The board members first met for an informal meeting in Basel on 22\u201323\nApril 1930, and adopted the bank's Statutes. They unanimously elected McGarrah\nas President of the BIS and Chairman of its Board, Fraser as alternate\nPresident, and Addis, Melchior and Moreau as Vice-Chairmen \"with equal rank\".\nQuesnay was appointed General Manager, albeit with the three German Board\nmembers voting against \"for serious reasons of principle\" (i.e. objecting to\nthe choice of a French national rather than to Quesnay as an individual).\nThese foundational decisions were later ratified by the first formal Board\nmeeting on 17 May 1930, as the April meeting had also agreed that the ordinary\nmeetings of the Board would henceforth take place in Basel on the second\nMonday of each month. On 17 May the BIS opened for business and formally took\nover the funds, accounts, capital, and records of the Agent General for\nReparation Payments. On 20 May, the bank's shares were publicly issued.\n\nReparation payments were first suspended for one year (Hoover moratorium, June\n1931) and then stopped altogether after the Lausanne Agreement of July 1932\nfailed to be ratified. Instead, the BIS focused on its second statutory task,\ni.e. fostering the cooperation between its member central banks. It acted as a\nmeeting forum for central banks and provided banking facilities to them. For\ninstance, in the late 1930s, the BIS was instrumental in helping continental\nEuropean central banks ship out part of their gold reserves to London.\n\nAs a purportedly apolitical organization, the BIS was unable to prevent\ntransactions that reflected contemporaneous geopolitical realities, but were\nalso widely regarded as unconscionable. As a result of the policy of\nappeasement of Nazi Germany by the UK and France, in March 1939 the BIS was\nobliged to transfer 23 tons of gold it held, on behalf of Czechoslovakia, to\nthe German Reichsbank, following the German annexation of Czechoslovakia. The\ndecision to do so is still considered the most controversial action by BIS."

        "generated_section_content_md": "At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the BIS Board of Directors\n\u2013 on which the main European central banks were represented \u2013 decided that the\nBank should remain open, but that, for the duration of hostilities, no\nmeetings of the Board of Directors were to take place and the Bank should\nmaintain a neutral stance in the conduct of its business. But as the war\ndragged on, evidence mounted that the BIS conducted operations that were\nhelpful to the Germans. Also, throughout the war, the Allies accused the Nazis\nof looting and pleaded with the BIS not to accept gold from the Reichsbank in\npayment for prewar obligations linked to the Young Plan. This was to no avail,\nas remelted gold was either confiscated from prisoners or seized in victory,\nand was thus unacceptable as payment to the BIS. Operations conducted by the\nBIS were viewed with increasing suspicion in London and Washington. The fact\nthat top-level German industrialists and advisors sat on the BIS Board seemed\nto provide ample evidence of how the BIS might be used by Hitler throughout\nthe war, with the help of American, British and French banks. Between 1933 and\n1945 the BIS Board of directors included Walther Funk, a prominent Nazi\nofficial, and Emil Puhl, responsible for processing dental gold looted from\nconcentration camp victims, as well as Hermann Schmitz, the director of IG\nFarben, and Baron von Schroeder, the owner of the J. H. Stein Bank [de], all\nof whom were later convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity.\n\nThe 1944 Bretton Woods Conference recommended the \"liquidation of the Bank for\nInternational Settlements at the earliest possible moment\". This resulted in\nthe BIS being the subject of a disagreement between the U.S. and British\ndelegations. The liquidation of the bank was supported by other European\ndelegates, as well as Americans (including Harry Dexter White and Secretary of\nthe Treasury Henry Morgenthau Jr.). Abolition was opposed by John Maynard\nKeynes, head of the British delegation.\n\nKeynes went to Morgenthau hoping to prevent or postpone the dissolution, but\nthe next day it was approved; however the bank was never actually liquidated.\nIn April 1945, the new U.S. president Harry S. Truman ended U.S. involvement\nin the scheme. The British government suspended the dissolution, and the\ndecision to liquidate the BIS was officially reversed in 1948."

According to\nan announcement made by the Swiss Government on 26 December 1952, Japan\nrenounced all rights, titles and interests in the BIS it had acquired under\nthe Hague Convention of January 1930. The BIS acted as Agent for the European\nPayments Union (EPU, 1950\u201358), an intra-European clearing arrangement designed\nto help the European countries in restoring currency convertibility and free,\nmultilateral trade. During the 1960s \u2013 the heyday of the Bretton Woods fixed\nexchange rate system \u2013 the BIS once again became the locus for transatlantic\nmonetary cooperation. It coordinated the central banks' Gold Pool and a number\nof currency support operations (e.g. Sterling Group Arrangements of 1966 and\n1968)[_citation needed_]. The Group of Ten (G10), including the main European\neconomies, Canada, Japan, and the United States, became the most prominent\ngrouping.\n\nThe BIS acquired land near the Basel SBB railway station between 1966 and\n1972. Architect Martin Burckhardt made three design proposals in 1969, among\nwhich the Board of the BIS selected an 82-meter high round tower. This was\nopposed by locals and their representation in the Swiss Heritage Society,\nwhich led to a public referendum in 1971 in which 69% of voters endorsed a\nrevised design with reduced height. The BIS moved into the new premises,\nsometimes dubbed the \"Tower of Basel,\" in 1977.\n\nWith the end of the Bretton Woods system (1971\u201373) and the return to floating\nexchange rates, financial instability came to the fore. The collapse of some\ninternationally active banks, such as Herstatt Bank (1974), highlighted the\nneed for improved banking supervision at an international level. The G10\nGovernors created the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), which\nremains active. The BIS developed into a global meeting place for regulators\nand for developing international standards (Basel Concordat, Basel Capital\nAccord, Basel II and III). Through its member central banks, the BIS was\nactively involved in the resolution of the Latin American debt crisis (1982).\n\nFrom 1964 until 1993, the BIS provided the secretariat for the Committee of\nGovernors of the Central Banks of the Member States of the European Community\n(Committee of Governors). This committee had been created by the European\nCouncil decision to improve monetary cooperation among the EC central banks.\nLikewise, the BIS in 1988\u201389 hosted most of the meetings of the Delors\nCommittee (Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union), which\nproduced a blueprint for monetary unification subsequently adopted in the\nMaastricht Treaty (1992). In 1993, when the Committee of Governors was\nreplaced by the European Monetary Institute (EMI \u2013 the precursor of the ECB),\nit moved from Basel to Frankfurt, cutting its ties with the BIS.\n\nIn 1998, the BIS acquired a second building on Aeschenplatz 1 in Basel,\ndesigned in 1986 by Mario Botta and previously owned and used by UBS. Since\nthen, the BIS has used that building to host its banking operations on behalf\nof member central banks."

Since 1998, these\nmeetings have been held every other month, so six times a year.\n\nThe meetings follow a perennial sequence. On Sunday evening, the inner group\nof governors gather at 7pm for the so-called Economic Consultative Committee,\nwhich typically lasts for about an hour followed by dinner, a key moment for\ninformal exchange and coordination. On Monday morning, the Global Economy\nMeeting (GEM) brings together a broader group of central banks, typically from\n9:30am to 12:30pm. On Monday afternoon, the so-called Governors' Meeting lasts\nfrom 2pm to 5pm. With the suspension of Russia since March 2022, 30\njurisdictions are members of the GEM and an additional 22 participate as\nobservers."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Irving Fisher Committee on Central Bank Statistics gathers 100 members,\nmostly national central banks as well as a few regional organizations such as\nthe Center for Latin American Monetary Studies [es] (CEMLA), Central American\nMonetary Council [es], and South East Asian Central Banks Research and\nTraining Centre (SEACEN). It is led by an 11-member executive elected by its\nmembers.\n\nReserve policy is also important, especially to consumers and the domestic\neconomy. To ensure liquidity and limit liability to the larger economy, banks\ncannot create money in specific industries or regions without limit. To make\nbank depositing and borrowing safer for customers and reduce the risk of bank\nruns, banks are required to set aside or \"reserve\".\n\nReserve policy is harder to standardize, as it depends on local conditions and\nis often fine-tuned to make industry-specific or region-specific changes,\nespecially within large developing nations. For instance, the People's Bank of\nChina requires urban banks to hold 7% reserves while letting rural banks\ncontinue to hold only 6%, and simultaneously telling all banks that reserve\nrequirements on certain overheated industries would rise sharply or penalties\nwould be laid if investments in them did not stop completely. The PBoC is thus\nunusual in acting as a national bank focused on the country and not on the\ncurrency, but its desire to control asset inflation is increasingly shared\namong BIS members who fear \"bubbles\", and among exporting countries that find\nit difficult to manage the diverse requirements of the domestic economy,\nespecially rural agriculture, and an export economy, especially in\nmanufactured goods.\n\nEffectively, the PBoC sets different reserve levels for domestic and export\nstyles of development. Historically, the United States also did this, by\ndividing federal monetary management into nine regions, in which the less-\ndeveloped western United States had looser policies.\n\nFor various reasons, it has become quite difficult to accurately assess\nreserves on more than simple loan instruments, and this plus the regional\ndifferences has tended to discourage standardizing any reserve rules at the\nglobal BIS scale. Historically, the BIS did set some standards which favoured\nlending money to private landowners (at about 5 to 1) and for-profit\ncorporations (at about 2 to 1) over loans to individuals. These distinctions\nreflecting classical economics were superseded by policies relying on\nundifferentiated market values \u2013 more in line with neoclassical economics."
