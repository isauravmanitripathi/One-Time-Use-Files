It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by\nrepresentatives from Australia, England, and South Africa. In 1965, the body\nwas renamed as the International Cricket Conference and adopted its current\nname in 1987. ICC has its headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe ICC currently has 110 member nations : 12 full members that play Test\nmatches, and 98 associate members. Timor-Leste Cricket Federation being the\nlatest addition as associate member in 2025. The ICC is responsible for the\norganisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most\nnotably the Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and ICC World Test Championship.\nIt also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned\nTest matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. It\npromulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of\ndiscipline for international cricket, and also co-ordinates action against\ncorruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit.\n\nThe ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries, which\ninclude all Test matches outside of the World Test Championship Final, and\nneither does it govern domestic cricket within member countries. It does not\nmake or alter the laws of the game, which have remained under the governance\nof Marylebone Cricket Club since 1788.\n\nThe Chairman heads the board of directors, and on 26 June 2014 Narayanaswami\nSrinivasan, the former president of Board of Control for Cricket in India\n(BCCI), was announced as the first chairman of the council. The role of ICC\npresident became a largely honorary position after the establishment of the\nchairman role and other changes made to the ICC constitution in 2014. It has\nbeen claimed that the 2014 changes have handed control to the 'Big Three'\nnations of England, India and Australia. The last ICC president was Zaheer\nAbbas, who was appointed in June 2015 following the resignation of Mustafa\nKamal in April 2015. When the post of ICC president was abolished in April\n2016, Shashank Manohar, who replaced Srinivasan in October 2015, became the\nfirst independent elected chairman of the ICC. Sanjog Gupta became the seventh\nCEO of the International Cricket Council on July 7, 2025, succeeding Jay Shah.\nHis role involves managing T20 league growth, sustaining cricket formats,\npromoting Olympic inclusion, and expanding global engagement."

        "generated_section_content_md": "On 30 November 1907, Abe Bailey, the President of the South African Cricket\nAssociation, wrote a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club's (MCC, England)\nsecretary, Francis Lacey. Bailey suggested the formation of an 'Imperial\nCricket Board'. In the letter, he suggested that the board would be\nresponsible for the formulation of rules and regulations that would govern the\nbilateral international matches of the three members, Australia, England and\nSouth Africa. Bailey wanted to host a Triangular Test series among the\nparticipant countries in South Africa. However, Australia rejected the offer.\nStill, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three\nmembers together during Australia's tour of England in 1909. After continued\nlobbying and efforts, Bailey was successful.\n\nOn 15 June 1909, representatives from England, Australia and South Africa met\nat Lord's and founded the _Imperial Cricket Conference_. A month later, a\nsecond meeting between the three members was held. The rules were agreed upon\namongst the nations, and the first-ever Tri-Test series was decided to be held\nin England in 1912.\n\nIn 1926, West Indies, New Zealand and India were elected as Full Members,\ndoubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. After the formation of\nPakistan in 1947, it was given Test status five years later in 1952, becoming\nthe seventh Test-playing, nation. In May 1961, South Africa left the\nCommonwealth and therefore lost membership."

The\nUS, Ceylon (who later became Sri Lanka} and Fiji were admitted as Associates,\na new class of members. In 1968, Denmark, Bermuda, Netherlands, and East\nAfrica were admitted as Associates, while South Africa had still not applied\nto rejoin the ICC.\n\nIn 1969, the basic rules of ICC were amended. At the 1971 meeting, the idea of\norganizing a World Cup was introduced. At the 1973 meeting, it was decided\nthat a World Cup would be played in 1975 in England. The six Test playing\nnations and East Africa and Sri Lanka were invited to take part.\n\nNew members were added frequently during this period: Israel and Singapore in\n1974, West Africa in 1976, Bangladesh in 1977, Papua-New Guinea in 1978, were\nadmitted as Associates. South Africa applied to rejoin, but their application\nwas rejected.\n\nIn 1981, Sri Lanka was promoted to a Full Member, and they played their first\nTest in 1982.\n\nIn 1984, a third class of membership (Affiliate) was introduced. Italy was the\nfirst such member, followed by Switzerland in 1985. In 1987, Bahamas and\nFrance were admitted, followed by Nepal in 1988."

By 1995, TV\nreplays were made available for run-outs and stumpings in Test matches, with\nthe third umpire required to signal out or not out with red and green lights\nrespectively. The following year, the cameras were used to determine if the\nball had crossed the boundary. In 1997 decisions on the cleanness of catches\ncould be referred to the third umpire.

The independently run ICC was funded initially by commercial\nexploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket.\nAs not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with the United Kingdom,\nit was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC\nDevelopment (International) Pvt. Ltd, known as IDI outside the UK. This was\nestablished in January 1994 and was based in Monaco [_This paragraph needs\ncitation(s)_].\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest\naffair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from\n2001 to 2008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member\ncountries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial\nstaff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the\ncouncil's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from\ntheir commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of\nbringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their\ncommercial income from tax.[_This paragraph needs citation(s)_]\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made,\nthrough Sport England, to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all\nits personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but\nbe given special exemption from paying UK corporation tax on its commercial\nincome. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would\nnot agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations\nand eventually settled on the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The\nICC is also registered in British Virgin Islands. In August 2005, the ICC\nmoved its offices to Dubai, and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and\nMonaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's executive\nboard in favour.\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to Dubai was the wish to bring\nits main employees together in one tax-efficient location, a secondary reason\nwas the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres\nof cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the\nICC had been administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (a situation\nthat lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world\ncricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British\nprivate members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct\nconsequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be\nthe move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue."

Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over\nUS$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income.\nIn the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating\nincome of $12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In\ncontrast, event income was US$285.87 million, including $239 million from the\n2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the\nperiod. In 2022 ICC generated US$208,375,000 as an net income.\n\nThe ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches\n(Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals), that\naccount for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they\nare owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to\naugment its World Cup revenues. These include the ICC Champions Trophy and the\nICC Super Series played in Australia in 2005. However, these events have not\nbeen as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a\nfailure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions\nTrophy to be scrapped in 2006. The Champions Trophy 2004 event was referred to\nin _Wisden 2005_ by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\";\nalthough the 2006 event was seen as a greater success due to a new format.\n\nThe ICC World Twenty20, first played in 2007, was a success. The ICC's current\nplan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World\nCup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year\nbefore the Olympic Games, and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year\nof the cycle. This arrangement began in 2022."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The ICC appoints international umpires and match referees who officiate at all\nsanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.\nThe ICC operates three panels of umpires: the Elite Panel, the International\nPanel, and the Associates and Affiliates Panel.\n\nAs of March 2012, the Elite Panel included twelve umpires. In theory, two\numpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite\nPanel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the\nInternational Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in\noccasional Test matches, as this is viewed an excellent good opportunity to\nsee whether they can cope at the Test level and whether they should be\nelevated to the Elite Panel. Members of the Elite Panel are full-time\nemployees of the ICC, although they do still, very occasionally, umpire first-\nclass cricket in their country of residence. The average annual officiating\nschedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential\non-field workload of 75 days per year, plus travel and preparation time.\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten\nTest-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in\ntheir home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket\ncalendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches.\nInternational Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such\nas the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup to improve their knowledge and\nunderstanding of overseas condition, and help them prepare for possible\npromotion to the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the\nCricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\"\nwho can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant\ntelevision replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own\ncountry, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then\nthe Elite Panel.\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was\nformed in June 2006. It superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate\nInternational Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for\numpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of\nthe five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\n\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are\neligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC\nIntercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments.\nHigh-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including\nthe ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in\nthe ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.\n\nThere is also an Elite Panel of ICC Referees who act as the independent\nrepresentative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it\nhad 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The\nReferees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be\ndone by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under\nthe ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging\nfrom an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be\nappealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.\n\nThe Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket-playing nations \u2013 as\nof June 2012 \u2013 on the universal application of an Umpire's Decision Review\nSystem, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to\nmutual agreement of the playing countries. In July 2012, ICC decided to send a\ndelegation to show the ball tracking research done by Ed Rosten, an expert on\ncomputer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the skepticism about the use\nof DRS technology."

Among the corruption on which they have\nreported was that of former South African captain Hansie Cronje who had\naccepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-\nperforming or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result.\nSimilarly, the former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja were\ninvestigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket\n(for life and for five years, respectively). The ACSU continues to monitor and\ninvestigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been\nintroduced, which for example prohibit the use of mobile telephones in\ndressing rooms.\n\nPrior to the 2007 Cricket World Cup, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed warned\nagainst any corruption and stated that the ICC would be vigilant and\nintolerant against it.\n\nFollowing a scandal that occurred during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3\nPakistani players, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt were found to\nbe guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years\nrespectively.
