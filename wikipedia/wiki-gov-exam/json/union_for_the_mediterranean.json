It was founded on 13 July 2008 at\nthe Paris Summit for the Mediterranean, with an aim of reinforcing the Euro-\nMediterranean Partnership (Euromed) that was set up in 1995 as the Barcelona\nProcess. Its general secretariat is located in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.\n\nThe union has the aim of promoting stability and integration throughout the\nMediterranean region. It is a forum for discussing regional strategic issues,\nbased on the principles of shared ownership, shared decision-making and shared\nresponsibility between the two shores of the Mediterranean. Its main goal is\nto increase both north\u2013south and South-South integration in the Mediterranean\nregion, in order to support the countries' socioeconomic development and\nensure stability in the region. The institution, through its course of\nactions, focuses on two main pillars: fostering human development and\npromoting sustainable development. To this end, it identifies and supports\nregional projects and initiatives of different sizes, to which it gives its\nlabel, following a consensual decision among the 42 countries.\n\nThese projects and initiatives focus on 6 sectors of activity, as mandated by\nthe UfM Member States:\n\n  * Business Development & Employment\n  * Higher Education & Research\n  * Social & Civil Affairs\n  * Energy & Climate Action\n  * Transport & Urban Development\n  * Water, Environment & Blue Economy"

        "generated_section_content_md": "Former French President Jacques Chirac, one of the founders of the Barcelona\nProcess\n\nThe Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, also known as the Barcelona Process, was\ncreated in 1995 as a result of the Conference of Euro-Mediterranean Ministers\nof Foreign Affairs held in Barcelona on 27 and 28 November under the Spanish\npresidency of the EU. The founding act of the Partnership in 1995 and Final\nDeclaration of the Barcelona Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference is\ncalled the Barcelona Declaration, which is often used to refer to the Process\nitself.\n\nThe Partnership culminated in a series of attempts by European countries to\narticulate their relations with their North African and Middle Eastern\nneighbours: the global Mediterranean policy (1972\u20131992) and the renovated\nMediterranean policy (1992\u20131995).\n\nJavier Solana opened the conference by saying that they were brought together\nto straighten out the \"clash of civilizations\" and misunderstandings that\nthere had been between them, and that it \"was auspicious\" that they had\nconvened on the 900th anniversary of the First Crusade. He described the\nconference as a process to foster cultural and economic unity in the\nMediterranean region. The Barcelona Treaty was drawn up by the 27 countries in\nattendance, and Solana, who represented Spain as its foreign minister during\nthe country's turn at the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, was\ncredited with the diplomatic accomplishment.\n\nAccording to the 1995 Barcelona Declaration, the aim of the initiative was\nsummed up as: \"turning the Mediterranean basin into an area of dialogue,\nexchange and cooperation guaranteeing peace, stability and prosperity\". The\nDeclaration established the three main objectives of the Partnership, called\n\"baskets\" (i.e., strands or facets):\n\n1. Definition of a common area of peace and stability through the reinforcement of political and security dialogue (Political and Security Basket).\n2. Construction of a zone of shared prosperity through an economic and financial partnership and the gradual establishment of a free-trade area (Economic and Financial Basket).\n3. Rapprochement between peoples through a social, cultural and human partnership aimed at encouraging understanding between cultures and exchanges between civil societies (Social, Cultural and Human Basket).\n\nThe European Union stated the intention of the partnership was \"to strengthen\nits relations with the countries in the Mashreq and Maghreb regions\". Both\nEhud Barak and Yasser Arafat had high praises for Solana's coordination of the\nBarcelona Process. The Barcelona Process, developed after the Conference in\nsuccessive annual meetings, is a set of goals designed to lead to a free trade\narea in the Mediterranean Basin by 2010.\n\nThe agenda of the Barcelona Process is:\n\n* Security and stability in the Mediterranean;\n* Agreeing on shared values and initializing a long-term process for cooperation in the Mediterranean;\n* Promoting democracy, good governance and human rights;\n* Achieving mutually satisfactory trading terms for the region's partners, the \"region\" consisting of the countries that participated;\n* Establishing a complementary policy to the United States' presence in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Barcelona Process comprises three \"baskets\", in EU jargon, or strands:\n\n* economic \u2013 to work for shared prosperity in the Mediterranean Region, including the Association Agreements on the bilateral level\n* political \u2013 promotion of political values, good governance and democracy\n* cultural \u2013 cultural exchange and strengthening civil society\n\nThe Euro-Mediterranean free trade area (EU-MEFTA) is based on the Barcelona\nProcess and European Neighbourhood Policy. The Agadir Agreement of 2004 is\nseen as its first building block.\n\nAt the time of its creation, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership comprised 27\nmember countries: 15 from the European Union and 12 Mediterranean countries\n(Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestine,\nSyria, Tunisia, and Turkey). As a result of the European Union's enlargements\nof 2004 and 2007 the number of EU member states grew up to 27, and two of the\nMediterranean partner countries\u2014Cyprus and Malta\u2014became part of the European\nUnion. The EU enlargement changed the configuration of the Barcelona Process\nfrom \"15+12\" to \"27+10\". Albania and Mauritania joined the Barcelona Process\nin 2007, raising the number of participants to 39."

        "generated_section_content_md": "By some analysts, the process has been declared ineffective [_who?_]. The\nstalling of the Middle East Peace Process is having an impact on the Barcelona\nProcess and is hindering progress especially in the first basket. The economic\nbasket can be considered a success, and there have been more projects for the\nexchange on a cultural level and between the peoples in the riparian states.\nOther criticism is mainly based on the predominant role the European Union is\nplaying. Normally it is the EU that is assessing the state of affairs, which\nleads to the impression that the North is dictating the South what to do. The\nquestion of an enhanced co-ownership of the process has repeatedly been\nbrought up over the last years.\n\nBeing a long-term process and much more complex than any other similar\nproject, it may be many years before a final judgment can be made.\n\nBishara Khader argues that this ambitious European project towards its\nMediterranean neighbours has to be understood in a context of optimism. On the\none hand, the European Community was undergoing important changes due to the\nreunification of Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the\nbeginning of the adhesion negotiations of Eastern and Central European\ncountries. On the other, the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict appeared to be getting\ncloser to achieving peace after the Madrid Conference (1991) and the Oslo\nAccords (1992). As well, Khader states that the Gulf War of 1991, the Algerian\ncrisis (from 1992 onwards) and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism throughout\nthe Arab world are also important factors in Europe's new relations with the\nMediterranean countries based on security concerns.\n\nCriticism of the Barcelona Process escalated after the celebration of the 10th\nAnniversary of the Euro-Mediterranean Summit in Barcelona in 2005. First, the\nabsence of Heads of State and Government from the Southern Mediterranean\ncountries (with the exception of the Palestinian and Turkish ones) heavily\ncontrasted with the attendance of the 27 European Union's Heads of State and\nGovernment. Second, the lack of consensus to define the term \"terrorism\"\nprevented the endorsement of a final declaration. The Palestinian Authority,\nBa'athist Syria, and Algeria argued that resistance movements against foreign\noccupation should not be included in this definition. Nevertheless, a code of\nconduct on countering terrorism and a five-year work program were approved at\nBarcelona summit of 2005. both of which are still valid under the Union for\nthe Mediterranean.\n\nFor many, the political context surrounding the 2005 summit \u2013 the stagnation\nof the Middle East Peace Process, the US-led war on Iraq, the lack of\ndemocratisation in Arab countries, and the war on terror's negative effects on\nfreedoms and human rights, among others\u2014proved for many the inefficiency of\nthe Barcelona Process for fulfilling its objectives of peace, stability and\nprosperity. Given these circumstances, even politicians that had been engaged\nwith the Barcelona Process since its very beginnings, like the Spanish\npolitician Josep Borrell, expressed their disappointment about the Euro-\nMediterranean Partnership and its incapacity to deliver results. Critiques\nfrom Southern Mediterranean countries blamed the Partnership's failure on\nEurope's lack of interest towards the Mediterranean in favour of its Eastern\nneighbourhood; whereas experts from the North accused Southern countries of\nonly being interested on \"their own bi-lateral relationship with the EU\" while\ndownplaying multilateral policies.\n\nHowever, many European Union diplomats have defended the validity of the\nBarcelona Process' framework by arguing that the Euro-Mediterranean\nPartnership was the only forum that gathered Israelis and Arabs on equal\nfooting), and identifying as successes the Association Agreements, the Code of\nConduct on Countering Terrorism and the establishment of the Anna Lindh\nFoundation for the Dialogue between Cultures.\n\nIn 2006 the first proposals for improving the Partnership's efficiency,\nvisibility and co-ownership arouse, such as establishing a co-presidency\nsystem and a permanent secretariat or nominating a \"Mr./Ms. Med.\""

        "generated_section_content_md": "As of 2007[update], on the initiative of France, States embark on a round\nnegotiations to revive the process.\n\nA proposal to establish a \"Mediterranean Union\", which would consist\nprincipally of Mediterranean states, was part of the election campaign of\nNicolas Sarkozy during the French presidential election campaign in 2007.\nDuring the campaign, Sarkozy said that the Mediterranean Union would be\nmodelled on the European Union with a shared judicial area and common\ninstitutions. Sarkozy saw Turkish membership of the Mediterranean Union as an\nalternative to membership of the European Union, which he opposes, and as a\nforum for dialogue between Israel and its Arab Neighbours.\n\nOnce elected, President Sarkozy invited all heads of state and government of\nthe Mediterranean region to a meeting in June 2008 in Paris, with a view to\nlaying the basis of a Mediterranean Union.\n\nThe Mediterranean Union was enthusiastically supported by Egypt and Israel.\nTurkey strongly opposed the idea and originally refused to attend the Paris\nconference until it was assured that membership of the Mediterranean Union was\nnot being proposed as an alternative to membership of the EU.\n\nAmong EU member states, the proposal was supported by Italy, Spain, and\nGreece.\n\nHowever the European Commission and Germany were more cautious about the\nproject. The European Commission saying that while initiatives promoting\nregional co-operation were good, it would be better to build them upon\nexisting structures, notable among them being the Barcelona process. German\nchancellor Angela Merkel said the UfM risked splitting and threatening the\ncore of the EU. In particular she objected to the potential use of EU funds to\nfund a project which was only to include a small number of EU member states.\nWhen Slovenia took the EU presidency at the beginning of 2008, the then\nSlovenian Prime Minister Janez Jan\u0161a added to the criticism by saying: \"We do\nnot need a duplication of institutions, or institutions that would compete\nwith EU, institutions that would cover part of the EU and part of the\nneighbourhood.\"\n\nOther criticisms of the proposal included concern about the relationship\nbetween the proposed UfM and the existing Euromediterranean Partnership\n(Barcelona Process), which might reduce the effectiveness of EU policies in\nthe region and allow the southern countries to play on the rivalries to escape\nunpopular EU policies. There were similar economic concerns in the loss of\ncivil society and similar human rights based policies. Duplication of policies\nfrom the EU's police and judicial area was a further worry.\n\nAt the start of 2008, Sarkozy began to modify his plans for the Mediterranean\nUnion due to widespread opposition from other EU member states and the\nEuropean Commission. At the end of February of that year, France's minister\nfor European affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet, stated that \"there is no\nMediterranean Union\" but rather a \"Union for the Mediterranean\" that would\nonly be \"completing and enriching\" to existing EU structures and policy in the\nregion. Following a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel it was agreed\nthat the project would include all EU member states, not just those bordering\nthe Mediterranean, and would be built upon the existing Barcelona process.\nTurkey also agreed to take part in the project following a guarantee from\nFrance that it was no longer intended as an alternative to EU membership.\n\nThe proposed creation of common institutions, and a Mediterranean Investment,\nwhich was to have been modelled on the European Investment Bank, was also\ndropped.\n\nIn consequence the new Union for the Mediterranean would consist of regular\nmeeting of the entire EU with the non-member partner states, and would be\nbacked by two co-presidents and a secretariat."

        "generated_section_content_md": "At the Paris Summit for the Mediterranean (13 July 2008), the 43 Heads of\nState and Government from the Euro-Mediterranean region decided to launch the\nBarcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. It was presented as a new\nphase Euro-Mediterranean Partnership with new members and an improved\ninstitutional architecture which aimed to \"enhance multilateral relations,\nincrease co-ownership of the process, set governance on the basis of equal\nfooting and translate it into concrete projects, more visible to citizens. Now\nis the time to inject a new and continuing momentum into the Barcelona\nProcess. More engagement and new catalysts are now needed to translate the\nobjectives of the Barcelona Declaration into tangible results.\"\n\nThe Paris summit was considered a diplomatic success for Nicolas Sarkozy. The\nFrench president had managed to gather in Paris all the Heads of State and\nGovernment from the 43 Euro-Mediterranean countries, with the exception of the\nkings of Morocco and Jordan.\n\nAt the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Affairs held in Marseille in\nNovember 2008, the Ministers decided to shorten the initiative's name to\nsimply the \"Union for the Mediterranean\".\n\nThis meeting concluded with a new joint declaration, which completed the Paris\nDeclaration by defining the organisational structure and the principles on\nwhich the UfM would be run. A rotating co-presidency was set up, held jointly\nby one EUmember country and one Mediterranean partner. France and Egypt were\nthe first countries to hold this co-presidency. The presence of the Arab\nLeague at all meetings is written into the rules. A secretariat with a\nseparate legal status and its own statutes was created. Its headquarters were\nestablished in Barcelona.\n\nThe fact that the Union for the Mediterranean is launched as a new phase of\nthe Euro-Mediterranean Partnership means that the Union accepts and commits to\nmaintain the _acquis_ of Barcelona, the purpose of which is to promote \"peace,\nstability and prosperity\" throughout the region (Barcelona, 2). Therefore, the\nfour chapters of cooperation developed in the framework of the Barcelona\nProcess during thirteen years remain valid:\n\n* _Politics and Security_\n* _Economics and Trade_\n* _Socio-cultural_\n* _Justice and Interior Affairs_. This fourth chapter was included at the 10th Anniversary Euro-Mediterranean Summit held in Barcelona in 2005.\n\nThe objective to establish a Free Trade Area in the Euro-Mediterranean region\nby 2010 (and beyond), first proposed at the 1995 Barcelona Conference, was\nalso endorsed by the Paris Summit of 2008.\n\nIn addition to these four chapters of cooperation, the 43 Ministers of Foreign\nAffairs gathered in Marseille in November 2008 identified six concrete\nprojects that target specific needs of the Euro-Mediterranean regions and that\nwill enhance the visibility of the Partnership:\n\n* _De-pollution of the Mediterranean_. This broad project encompasses many initiatives that target good environmental governance, access to drinkable water, water management, pollution reduction and protection of the Mediterranean biodiversity.\n* _Maritime and land highways_. The purpose of this project is to increase and improve the circulation of commodities and people throughout the Euro-Mediterranean region by improving its ports, and building highways and railways. Specifically, the Paris and Marseille Declarations refer to the construction of both a Trans-Maghrebi railway and highway systems, connecting Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.\n* _Civil protection_. The civil protection project aims at improving the prevention, preparedness and response to both natural and man-made disasters. The ultimate goal is to \"bring the Mediterranean Partner Countries progressively closer to the European Civil Protection Mechanism\".\n* _Alternative energies: Mediterranean solar plan_. The goal of this project is to promote the production and use of renewable energies. More specifically, it aims at turning the Mediterranean partner countries into producers of solar energy and then circulating the resulting electricity through the Euro-Mediterranean region. In this connection the union and the industrial initiative Dii signed a Memorandum of Understanding for future collaboration in May 2012 which included developing their long-term strategies \"Mediterranean Solar Plan\" and \"Desert Power 2050\". At the signing in Marrakesh the union's Secretary General called the new partnership \"a key step for the implementation of the Mediterranean Solar Plan\".\n* _Higher education and research: Euro-Mediterranean University_. In June 2008 the Euro-Mediterranean University of Slovenia was inaugurated in Piran (Slovenia), which offers graduate studies programs. The Foreign Ministers gathered at Marseille in 2008 also called for the creation of another Euro-Mediterranean University in Fes, Morocco, Euro-Mediterranean University of Morocco (Euromed-UM). The decision to go ahead with the Fes university was announced in June 2012. At the 2008 Paris summit, the 43 Heads of State and Government agreed that the goal of this project is to promote higher education and scientific research in the Mediterranean, as well as to establish in the future a \"Euro-Mediterranean Higher Education, Science and Research Area\".\n* _The Mediterranean business development initiative_. The purpose of the initiative is to promote small and medium-sized enterprises from the Mediterranean partner countries by \"assessing the needs of these enterprises, defining policy solutions and providing these entities with resources in the form of technical assistance and financial instruments\"."

        "generated_section_content_md": "A summit of heads of state and government is intended to be held every two\nyears to foster political dialogue at the highest level. According to the\nParis Declaration:\n\n* these summits should produce a joint declaration addressing the situation and challenges of the Euro-Mediterranean region, assessing the works of the Partnership and approving a two-year work program;\n* Ministers of Foreign Affairs should meet annually to monitor the implementation of the summit declaration and to prepare the agenda of subsequent summits; and\n* the host country of the summits would be chosen upon consensus and should alternate between EU and Mediterranean countries.\n\nThe first summit was held in Paris in July 2008. The second summit should have\ntaken place in a non-EU country in July 2010 but the Euro-Mediterranean\ncountries agreed to hold the summit in Barcelona on 7 June 2010, under the\nSpanish presidency of the EU, instead. However, on 20 May the Egyptian and\nFrench co-presidency along with Spain decided to postpone the summit, in a\nmove which they described as being intended to give more time to the indirect\ntalks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that had started that\nmonth. In contrast, the Spanish media blamed the postponement on the Arab\nthreat to boycott the summit if Avigdor Lieberman, Israel's Minister of\nForeign Affairs, attended the Foreign Affairs conference prior to the summit.\n\nAt the time of the Paris summit, France\u2014which was in charge of the EU\npresidency\u2014and Egypt held the co-presidency. Since then, France had been\nsigning agreements with the different rotator presidencies of the EU (the\nCzech Republic, Sweden and Spain) in order to maintain the co-presidency for\nalongside Egypt. The renewal of the co-presidency was supposed to happen on\nthe second Union for the Mediterranean Summit. However, due to the two\npostponements of the summit, there has been no chance to decide which\ncountries will take over the co-presidency.\n\nThe conflict between Turkey and Cyprus has been responsible for the delay in\nthe endorsement of the statutes of the Secretariat, which were only approved\nin March 2010 even though the Marseille declaration set May 2009 as the\ndeadline for the Secretariat to start functioning. At the Paris summit, the\nHeads of State and Government agreed to establish five Deputy Secretaries\nGeneral from Greece, Israel, Italy, Malta and the Palestinian Authority.\nTurkey's desire to have a Deputy Secretary General and Cyprus' rejection of\nit, resulted in months of negotiation until Cyprus finally approved the\ncreation of a sixth Deputy Secreaty General post assigned to a Turkish\ncitizen.\n\nDue to its seriousness, the Arab-Israeli conflict is the one that most deeply\naffects the Union for the Mediterranean. As a result of an armed conflict\nbetween Israel and Gaza from December 2008 to January 2009, the Arab Group\nrefused to meet at high level, thus blocking all the ministerial meetings\nscheduled for the first half of 2009. As well, the refusal of the Arab\nMinisters of Foreign Affairs to meet with their Israeli counterpart, Avigdor\nLieberman, resulted in the cancellation of two ministerial meetings on Foreign\nAffairs in November 2009 and June 2010. Sectorial meetings of the Union for\nthe Mediterranean have also been affected by Israel's handling of the\nPalestinian civilian population under its control. At the Euro-Mediterranean\nministerial meeting on Water, held in Barcelona in April 2010, the Water\nStrategy was not approved due to a terminological disagreement of whether to\nrefer to territories claimed by Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese as\n\"occupied territories\" or \"territories under occupation\". Two other\nministerial meetings, on higher education and agriculture, had to be cancelled\nbecause of the same discrepancy.\n\nAfter the initial postponement, both France and Spain announced their\nintentions to hold peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority as\npart of the postponed summit under the auspices of the US. In September, U.S.\nPresident Barack Obama was invited to the summit for this purpose. The summit\nwhich was then scheduled to take place in Barcelona on 21 November 2010, was,\naccording to Nicolas Sarkozy, \"an occasion to support the negotiations\".\n\nNevertheless, at the beginning of November 2010 the peace talks stalled, and\nthe Egyptian co-presidents conditioned the occurrence of the summit on a\ngesture from Israel that would allow the negotiations to resume. According to\nsome experts Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of the construction of 300 new\nhousing units in East Jerusalem ended all the possibilities of celebrating the\nsummit on 21 November. The two co-presidencies and Spain decided on 15\nNovember to postpone the summit _sine die_ , alleging that the stagnation of\nthe Middle East Peace Process would hinder a \"satisfactory participation\".\n\nHaving been slowed down by the financial and political situation in 2009, the\nUfM was given a decisive push in March 2010 with the conclusion of the\nnegotiations on the set-up of its General Secretariat and the official\ninauguration of the same on 4 March 2010 in Barcelona, in the specially\nrefurbished Palau de Pedralbes.\n\nThe European Union Ambassador to Morocco, Eneko Landaburu, stated in September\n2010 that he does \"not believe\" in the Union for the Mediterranean. According\nto him, the division among the Arabs \"does not allow to implement a strong\ninter-regional policy\", and calls to leave this ambitious project of 43\ncountries behind and focus on bilateral relations."

Following the June 2012 meeting the EIB announced it would give 500 million euros to support projects for the UfM.\n* The InfraMed Infrastructure Fund was established in June 2010 by five financial entities: the French Caisse des D\u00e9p\u00f4ts, the Moroccan Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4ts et de Gestion, the Egyptian EFG Hermes, the Italian Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and the European Investment Bank.
