It first met in November 1975. The test demonstrated that certain non-\nweapons specific nuclear technology could be readily turned to weapons\ndevelopment. Nations already signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation\nTreaty (NPT) saw the need to further limit the export of nuclear equipment,\nmaterials or technology. Another benefit was that non-NPT and non-Zangger\nCommittee nations, then specifically France, could be brought in.\n\nA series of meetings in London from 1975 to 1978 resulted in agreements on the\nguidelines for export; these were published as INFCIRC/254 (essentially the\nZangger \"Trigger List\") by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Listed\nitems could only be exported to non-nuclear states if certain International\nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards were agreed to or if exceptional circumstances\nrelating to safety existed.\n\nThe name of the \"London Club\" was due to the series of meetings in London. It\nhas also been referred to as the London Group, or the London Suppliers Group.\n\nThe NSG did not meet again until 1991. The \"Trigger List\" remained unchanged\nuntil 1991, although the Zangger list was regularly updated. The revelations\nabout the Iraqi weapons program following the first Gulf War led to a\ntightening of the export of so-called dual-use equipment. At the first meeting\nsince 1978, held at the Hague in March 1991, the twenty-six participating\ngovernments agreed to the changes, which were published as the \"Dual-use List\"\nin 1992, and also to the extension of the original list to more closely match\nthe up-to-date Zangger list."

Pakistan has launched a major\nlobbying campaign to get additional support on its NSG membership. The US has\nnot publicly opposed Pakistan, the US State Department's Spokesperson Mark\nToner commented in May 2016: \u201cThey have made public their interest, and\ncertainly any country can submit its application for membership.

China has\nalso tied Indian bid to Pakistani bid, blocking the former's entry repeatedly\nbased on the argument that If India can be let in without signing NPT, then\nPakistan should be granted membership as well.\n\nIn 2004, the illicit procurement network run by Pakistani scientist AQ Khan,\nwho led Pakistan's uranium enrichment program, was exposed. This network\ntrafficked in nuclear and dual-use goods and supported nuclear weapons\nprograms in Iran, Libya and North Korea as well as Pakistan itself, and\nincluded individuals and entities from over 30 countries. In 2004, Pakistan\nalso promulgated an Export Control Act on Goods, Technologies, Materials and\nEquipment related to Nuclear and Biological Weapons and their Delivery Systems\nand published Export Control Lists in 2005, which have been frequently\nupdated. The United States on 26 March 2018 sanctioned seven Pakistani firms\nfor nuclear proliferation, potentially hurting its ambitions of NSG\nmembership."

Several participating governments, including Austria,\nSwitzerland, Norway, Ireland, and New Zealand, expressed reservations about\nthe lack of conditions in the proposed exemption. In another meeting on 6\nSeptember 2008, the NSG participating governments agreed to grant India a\n\"clean waiver\" from its existing rules, which forbid nuclear trade with a\ncountry which has not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The\nNSG's decision came after three days of intense U.S. diplomacy. The approval\nwas based on a formal pledge by India stating that it would not share\nsensitive nuclear technology or material with others and would uphold its\nvoluntary moratorium on testing nuclear weapons. The pledge was contained in a\ncrucial statement issued during the NSG meeting by India outlining the\ncountry's disarmament and nonproliferation policies."
