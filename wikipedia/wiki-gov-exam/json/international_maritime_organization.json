It\nwas established following agreement at a UN conference held in Geneva in 1948,\nbut this did not come into force for ten years, and the new body, then called\nthe Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, first assembled on\n6 January 1959. Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, the IMO has 176\nMember States and three Associate Members as of 2025.\n\nThe IMO's purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory\nframework for shipping and its remit includes maritime safety, environmental\nconcerns, and legal matters. IMO is governed by an assembly of members which\nmeets every two years. Its finance and organization is administered by a\ncouncil of 40 members elected from the assembly. The work of IMO is conducted\nthrough five committees supported by technical subcommittees. Other UN\norganizations may observe the proceedings of the IMO. Observer status is\ngranted to qualified NGOs.\n\nIMO is supported by a permanent secretariat of employees who are\nrepresentative of the organization's members. The secretariat is composed of a\nSecretary-General elected by the assembly, and various divisions such as those\nfor marine safety, environmental protection and a conference section."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Opening and anniversary plaques of Queen Elizabeth II and model of _Queen Mary\n2_ in the lobby of the IMO Headquarters\n\nIn February\u2013March 1948 the United Nations Maritime Conference in Geneva\ninstitutionalized the regulation of the safety of shipping into an\ninternational framework. Hitherto such international conventions had been\ninitiated piecemeal, notably the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS),\nadopted in 1914 following the _Titanic_ disaster. The conference resolved\n\"that an international organization to be known as the Intergovernmental\nMaritime Consultative Organization shall be established\"; however many\ncountries did not trust the convention, so ratification was slow and it took\nuntil March 1958 until it came into force.\n\nThe _Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization_ (IMCO; now using\nthe hyphen) held its first Assembly in London in January 1959. Its initial\ntask was to update the SOLAS; the resulting 1960 International Convention for\nthe Safety of Life at Sea was recast in 1974 and subsequently modified and\nupdated to adapt to changes in safety requirements and technology. Since 1978,\nevery last Thursday of September has been celebrated as World Maritime Day.\n\nWhen IMCO began its operations in 1959 certain other pre-existing conventions\nwere brought under its aegis, most notably the International Convention for\nthe Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil (OILPOL) from 1954. Under the\nguidance of IMCO, the convention was amended in 1962, 1969, and 1971.\n\nOil spill on a beach\n\nAs oil trade and industry developed, many people in the industry saw a need\nfor further improvements in regards to pollution prevention. This became\nincreasingly apparent in 1967, when the tanker _Torrey Canyon_ ran aground\nentering the English Channel and spilled record-breaking 120,000 tons of crude\noil. This incident prompted a series of new conventions.\n\nIMO held an emergency session of its council to deal with the need to\nreaddress regulations pertaining to maritime pollution. In 1969, the IMO\nAssembly decided to host an international gathering in 1973 dedicated to this\nissue. The goal was to develop an international agreement for controlling\ngeneral environmental contamination by ships when out at sea. During the next\nfew years IMO brought to the forefront a series of measures designed to\nprevent large ship accidents and to minimize their effects. It also detailed\nhow to deal with the environmental threat caused by routine ship duties such\nas the cleaning of oil cargo tanks or the disposal of engine room wastes. By\ntonnage, the aforementioned was a bigger problem than accidental pollution.\nThe most significant development to come out of this conference was the\nInternational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973\n(MARPOL). It covers not only accidental and operational oil pollution but also\ndifferent types of pollution by chemicals, goods in packaged form, sewage,\ngarbage and air pollution. The original MARPOL was signed on 17 February 1973,\nbut did not come into force due to lack of ratifications. The current\nconvention is a combination of 1973 Convention and the 1978 Protocol. It\nentered into force on 2 October 1983. As of January 2018, 156 states,\nrepresenting 99.42 per cent of the world's shipping tonnage, are signatories\nto the MARPOL convention.[_needs update_]\n\nAs well as updates to MARPOL and SOLAS, the IMO facilitated several updated\ninternational maritime conventions, including the International Convention on\nLoad Lines in 1966 (replacing an earlier 1930 Convention), the International\nRegulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea in 1972 (also replacing an\nearlier set of rules) and the STCW Convention in 1978. In 1975, the assembly\nof the IMO decided that future conventions of the International Convention for\nthe Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and other IMO instruments should use SI\nunits. Sea transportation is one of few industrial areas that still commonly\nuses non-metric units such as the nautical mile (nmi) for distance and knots\n(kn) for speed or velocity.\n\nIn November 1975, the IMCO Assembly, as a part of comprehensive review of the\nConvention, decided to rename it as the _International Maritime Organization_\n(IMO); after ratifications, this happened in May 1982. Throughout its\nexistence, the IMO has continued to produce new and updated conventions across\na wide range of maritime issues covering not only safety of life and marine\npollution but also encompassing safe navigation, search and rescue, wreck\nremoval, tonnage measurement, liability and compensation, ship recycling, the\ntraining and certification of seafarers, and piracy. More recently SOLAS has\nbeen amended to bring an increased focus on maritime security through the\nInternational Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) Code. The IMO has also\nincreased its focus on smoke emissions from ships. In 1983, the IMO\nestablished the World Maritime University in Malm\u00f6, Sweden and also\nfacilitated the adoption of the IGC Code. In 1991, the IMO facilitated the\nadoption of the International Grain Code.\n\nIn December 2002, new amendments to the 1974 SOLAS Convention were enacted by\nthe IMO. These gave rise to the International Ship and Port Facility Security\n(ISPS) Code, which went into effect on 1 July 2004. The concept of the code is\nto provide layered and redundant defences against smuggling, terrorism,\npiracy, stowaways, etc. The ISPS Code required most ships and port facilities\nengaged in international trade to establish and maintain strict security\nprocedures as specified in ship and port specific Ship Security Plans and Port\nFacility Security Plans."

An e-Navigation strategy was ratified in 2005, and an\nimplementation plan was developed through three IMO sub-committees. The plan\nwas completed by 2014 and implemented in November of that year. IMO has also\nserved as a key partner and enabler of US international and interagency\nefforts to establish maritime domain awareness.[_citation needed_]"

The First\nIntersessional Meeting of IMO's Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Emissions from\nShips took place in Oslo, Norway (23\u201327 June 2008), tasked with developing the\ntechnical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future\nIMO regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping,\nand a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves, for further\nconsideration by IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC). The IMO\nparticipated in the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris\nseeking to establish itself as the \"appropriate international body to address\ngreenhouse gas emissions from ships engaged in international trade\".\nNonetheless, there has been widespread criticism of the IMO's relative\ninaction since the conclusion of the Paris conference, with the initial data-\ngathering step of a three-stage process to reduce maritime greenhouse\nemissions expected to last until 2020. In 2018, the Initial IMO Strategy on\nthe reduction of GHG emissions from ships was adopted. In 2021, _The New York\nTimes_ wrote that the IMO \"has repeatedly delayed and watered down climate\nregulations\".\n\nThe IMO has also taken action to mitigate the global effects of ballast water\nand sediment discharge, through the 2004 Ballast Water Management Convention,\nwhich entered into force in September 2017.\n\nIn December 2023 the IMO adopted a resolution targeting \"dark fleet\" tankers\nthat form a risk by undertaking illegal and unsafe activities at sea.\nPrimarily working for Iran and Russia to breach international sanctions, the\ntankers, many of which are elderly and unreliable, often undertake mid ocean\ntransfers in an attempt to evade sanctions. The resolution calls upon flag\nstates to \u201cadhere to measures which lawfully prohibit or regulate\u201d the\ntransfer of cargoes at sea, known as ship-to-ship transfers.\n\nIn April 2025, the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC)\napproved net-zero regulations for the global shipping industry to reach net-\nzero GHG emissions in the shipping industry by or around 2050."
