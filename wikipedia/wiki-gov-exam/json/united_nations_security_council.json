        "generated_section_content_md": "One of the six principal organs of the UN\n\nThe **United Nations Security Council** (**UNSC**) is one of the six principal\norgans of the United Nations (UN) and is charged with ensuring international\npeace and security, recommending the admission of new UN members to the\nGeneral Assembly, and approving any changes to the UN Charter. Its powers as\noutlined in the United Nations Charter include establishing peacekeeping\noperations, enacting international sanctions, and authorizing military action.\nThe UNSC is the only UN body with authority to issue resolutions that are\nbinding on member states.\n\nLike the UN as a whole, the Security Council was created after World War II to\naddress the failings of the League of Nations in maintaining world peace. It\nheld its first session on 17 January 1946 but was largely paralysed in the\nfollowing decades by the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet\nUnion (and their allies). Nevertheless, it authorized military interventions\nin the Korean War and the Congo Crisis and peacekeeping missions in Cyprus,\nWest New Guinea, and the Sinai Peninsula. With the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion, UN peacekeeping efforts increased dramatically in scale, with the\nSecurity Council authorizing major military and peacekeeping missions in\nKuwait, Namibia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe Security Council consists of fifteen members, of which five are permanent:\nChina, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These were\nthe great powers that were the victors of World War II (or their recognized\nsuccessor states). Permanent members can veto any substantive Security Council\nresolution, including those on the admission of new member states to the\nUnited Nations or nominees for the Office of Secretary-General. This veto\nright does not carry over into General Assembly matters or votes, which are\nnon-binding. The other ten members are elected on a regional basis for a term\nof two years. The body's presidency rotates monthly amongst its members.\n\nResolutions of the Security Council are typically enforced by UN peacekeepers,\nwhich consist of military forces voluntarily provided by member states and\nfunded independently of the main UN budget. As of November 2021[update], there\nhave been 12 peacekeeping missions with over 87,000 personnel from 121\ncountries, with a total annual budget of approximately $6.3 billion."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the century prior to the UN's creation, several international treaty\norganizations and conferences had been formed to regulate conflicts between\nnations, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Hague\nConventions of 1899 and 1907. Following the catastrophic loss of life in World\nWar I, the Paris Peace Conference established the League of Nations to\nmaintain harmony between the nations. This organization successfully resolved\nsome territorial disputes and created international structures for areas such\nas postal mail, aviation, and opium control, some of which would later be\nabsorbed into the UN. However, the League lacked representation for colonial\npeoples (then half the world's population) and significant participation from\nseveral major powers, including the US, the USSR, Germany, and Japan; it\nfailed to act against the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria, the Second\nItalo-Ethiopian War in 1935, the 1937 Japanese occupation of China, and Nazi\nexpansions under Adolf Hitler that escalated into World War II.\n\nChiang Kai-shek, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met at the Cairo\nConference in 1943 during World War II. British Prime Minister Winston\nChurchill, US President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Soviet general secretary\nJoseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference, February 1945\n\nOn New Year's Day 1942, President Roosevelt, Prime Minister Churchill, Maxim\nLitvinov of the USSR, and T. V. Soong of the Republic of China, signed a short\ndocument, based on the Atlantic Charter and the London Declaration, which\nlater came to be known as the United Nations Declaration. The next day the\nrepresentatives of 22 other nations added their signatures. The term \"United\nNations\" was first officially used when 26 governments had signed the\nDeclaration. By 1 March 1945, 21 additional states had signed. The term \"Four\nPowers\" was coined to refer to the four major Allied countries: the United\nStates, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the Republic of China. and\nbecame the foundation of an executive branch of the United Nations, the\nSecurity Council.\n\nFollowing the 1943 Moscow Conference and Tehran Conference, in mid-1944, the\ndelegations from the Allied \"Big Four\", the Soviet Union, the UK, the US and\nthe Republic of China, met for the Dumbarton Oaks Conference in Washington,\nD.C. to negotiate the UN's structure, and the composition of the UN Security\nCouncil quickly became the dominant issue. France, the Republic of China, the\nSoviet Union, the UK and US were selected as permanent members of the Security\nCouncil; the US attempted to add Brazil as a sixth member but was opposed by\nthe heads of the Soviet and British delegations. The most contentious issue at\nDumbarton and in successive talks proved to be the veto rights of permanent\nmembers. The Soviet delegation argued that each nation should have an absolute\nveto that could block matters from even being discussed, whilst the British\nargued that nations should not be able to veto resolutions on disputes to\nwhich they were a party. At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, the\nAmerican, British and Russian delegations agreed that each of the \"Big Five\"\ncould veto any action by the council, but not procedural resolutions, meaning\nthat the permanent members could not prevent debate on a resolution.\n\nOn 25 April 1945, the UN Conference on International Organization began in San\nFrancisco, attended by fifty governments and a number of non-governmental\norganizations involved in drafting the United Nations Charter. At the\nconference, H. V. Evatt of the Australian delegation pushed to further\nrestrict the veto power of Security Council permanent members. Due to the fear\nthat rejecting the strong veto would cause the conference's failure, his\nproposal was defeated twenty votes to ten.\n\nThe UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945 upon ratification of\nthe Charter by the five then-permanent members of the Security Council and by\na majority of the other 46 signatories. On 17 January 1946, the Security\nCouncil met for the first time at Church House, Westminster, in London, United\nKingdom. Subsequently, during the 1946\u20131951 period it conducted sessions at\nthe United Nation's interim headquarters in Lake Success, New York, which were\ntelevised live on CBS by the journalist Edmund Chester in 1949."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Church House in London where the first Security Council Meeting took place on\n17 January 1946\n\nThe Security Council was largely paralysed in its early decades by the Cold\nWar in between the US and USSR and their allies and the Council generally was\nonly able to intervene in unrelated conflicts. (A notable exception was the\n1950 Security Council resolution authorizing a US-led coalition to repel the\nNorth Korean invasion of South Korea, passed in the absence of the USSR.) In\n1956, the first UN peacekeeping force was established to end the Suez Crisis;\nhowever, the UN was unable to intervene against the USSR's simultaneous\ninvasion of Hungary following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Cold War\ndivisions also paralysed the Security Council's Military Staff Committee,\nwhich had been formed by Articles 45\u201347 of the UN Charter to oversee UN forces\nand create UN military bases. The committee continued to exist on paper but\nlargely abandoned its work in the mid-1950s.\n\nIn 1960, the UN deployed the United Nations Operation in the Congo (UNOC), the\nlargest military force of its early decades, to restore order to the breakaway\nState of Katanga, restoring it to the control of the Democratic Republic of\nthe Congo by 1964. However, the Security Council found itself bypassed in\nfavour of direct negotiations between the superpowers in some of the decade's\nlarger conflicts, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Vietnam War.\nFocusing instead on smaller conflicts without an immediate Cold War\nconnection, the Security Council deployed the United Nations Temporary\nExecutive Authority in West New Guinea in 1962 and the United Nations\nPeacekeeping Force in Cyprus in 1964, the latter of which would become one of\nthe UN's longest-running peacekeeping missions.\n\nOn 25 October 1971, over US opposition, but with the support of many Third\nWorld nations, along with the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, the\nmainland, communist People's Republic of China replaced Republic of China with\na seat on the Security Council; the vote was widely seen as a sign of waning\nUS influence in the organization. With an increasing Third World presence and\nthe failure of UN mediation in conflicts in the Middle East, Vietnam and\nKashmir, the UN increasingly shifted its attention to its ostensibly secondary\ngoals of economic development and cultural exchange. By the 1970s, the UN\nbudget for social and economic development was far greater than its budget for\npeacekeeping."

        "generated_section_content_md": "US Secretary of State Colin Powell holds a model vial of anthrax whilst giving\na presentation to the Security Council in February 2003.\n\nAfter the Cold War, the UN saw a radical expansion in its peacekeeping duties,\ntaking on more missions in ten years than it had in the previous four decades.\nBetween 1988 and 2000, the number of adopted Security Council resolutions more\nthan doubled, and the peacekeeping budget increased more than tenfold. The UN\nnegotiated an end to the Salvadoran Civil War, launched a successful\npeacekeeping mission in Namibia, and oversaw democratic elections in post-\napartheid South Africa and post-Khmer Rouge Cambodia. In 1991, the Security\nCouncil demonstrated its renewed vigor by condemning the Iraqi invasion of\nKuwait on the same day of the attack and later authorizing a US-led coalition\nthat successfully repulsed the Iraqis. Undersecretary-General Brian Urquhart\nlater described the hopes raised by these successes as a \"false renaissance\"\nfor the organization, given the more troubled missions that followed.\n\nThough the UN Charter had been written primarily to prevent aggression by one\nnation against another, in the early 1990s, the UN faced a number of\nsimultaneous, serious crises within nations such as Haiti, Mozambique and the\nformer Yugoslavia. The UN mission to Bosnia faced \"worldwide ridicule\" for its\nindecisive and confused mission in the face of ethnic cleansing. In 1994, the\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda failed to intervene in the\nRwandan genocide in the face of Security Council indecision.\n\nIn the late 1990s, UN-authorized international interventions took a wider\nvariety of forms. The UN mission in the 1991\u20132002 Sierra Leone Civil War was\nsupplemented by British Royal Marines and the UN-authorized 2001 invasion of\nAfghanistan was overseen by NATO. In 2003, the US invaded Iraq despite failing\nto pass a UN Security Council resolution for authorization, prompting a new\nround of questioning of the organization's effectiveness. In the same decade,\nthe Security Council intervened with peacekeepers in crises including the War\nin Darfur in Sudan and the Kivu conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nIn 2013, an internal review of UN actions in the final battles of the Sri\nLankan Civil War in 2009 concluded that the organization had suffered\n\"systemic failure\". In November/December 2014, Egypt presented a motion\nproposing an expansion of the NPT (non-Proliferation Treaty), to include\nIsrael and Iran; this proposal was due to increasing hostilities and\ndestruction in the Middle-East connected to the Syrian Conflict as well as\nothers. All members of the Security Council are signatory to the NPT, and all\npermanent members are nuclear weapons states."

The Security Council also recommends\nthe new Secretary-General to the General Assembly and recommends new states\nfor admission as member states of the United Nations. The Security Council has\ntraditionally interpreted its mandate as covering only military security,\nthough US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke controversially persuaded the body to\npass a resolution on HIV/AIDS in Africa in 2000.\n\nUnder Chapter VI of the Charter, \"Pacific Settlement of Disputes\", the\nSecurity Council \"may investigate any dispute, or any situation which might\nlead to international friction or give rise to a dispute\". The Council may\n\"recommend appropriate procedures or methods of adjustment\" if it determines\nthat the situation might endanger international peace and security. These\nrecommendations are generally considered to not be binding, as they lack an\nenforcement mechanism. A minority of scholars, such as Stephen Zunes, have\nargued that resolutions made under Chapter VI are \"still directives by the\nSecurity Council and differ only in that they do not have the same stringent\nenforcement options, such as the use of military force\".\n\nUnder Chapter VII, the council has broader power to decide what measures are\nto be taken in situations involving \"threats to the peace, breaches of the\npeace, or acts of aggression.\" In such situations, the council is not limited\nto recommendations but may take action, including the use of armed force \"to\nmaintain or restore international peace and security.\" This was the legal\nbasis for UN armed action in Korea in 1950 during the Korean War and the use\nof coalition forces in Iraq and Kuwait in 1991 and Libya in 2011. Decisions\ntaken under Chapter VII, such as economic sanctions, are binding on UN\nmembers; the Security Council is the only UN body with authority to issue\nbinding resolutions.\n\nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court recognizes that the\nSecurity Council has authority to refer cases to the Court in which the Court\ncould not otherwise exercise jurisdiction. The Council exercised this power\nfor the first time in March 2005, when it referred to the Court \"the situation\nprevailing in Darfur since 1 July 2002\"; since Sudan is not a party to the\nRome Statute, the Court could not otherwise have exercised jurisdiction. The\nSecurity Council made its second such referral in February 2011 when it asked\nthe ICC to investigate the Libyan government's violent response to the Libyan\nCivil War.\n\nSecurity Council Resolution 1674, adopted on 28 April 2006, \"reaffirms the\nprovisions of paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document\nregarding the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes,\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity\". The Security Council reaffirmed\nthis responsibility to protect in Resolution 1706 on 31 August of that year.\nThese resolutions commit the Security Council to protect civilians in an armed\nconflict, including taking action against genocide, war crimes, ethnic\ncleansing and crimes against humanity."

There have been two major seat changes since then. China's\nseat was originally held by Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Government, the\nRepublic of China. However, the Nationalists were forced to retreat to the\nisland of Taiwan in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. The Chinese Communist\nParty assumed control of mainland China, thenceforth known as the People's\nRepublic of China. In 1971, General Assembly Resolution 2758 recognized the\nPeople's Republic as the rightful representative of China in the UN and gave\nit the seat on the Security Council that had been held by the Republic of\nChina, which was expelled from the UN altogether with no opportunity for\nmembership as a separate nation. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in\n1991, the Russian Federation was recognized as the legal successor state of\nthe Soviet Union and maintained the latter's position on the Security Council.\n\nThe five permanent members of the Security Council were the victorious powers\nin World War II and have maintained the world's most powerful military forces\never since. They annually topped the list of countries with the highest\nmilitary expenditures. In 2013, they spent over US$1 trillion combined on\ndefence, accounting for over 55% of global military expenditures (the US alone\naccounting for over 35%). They are also amongst the world's largest arms\nexporters and are the only nations officially recognized as \"nuclear-weapon\nstates\" under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), though there are\nother states known or believed to be in possession of nuclear\nweapons.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe block of Western democratic and generally aligned permanent members\n(France, the UK and the US) is styled as the \"P3\"."

A negative vote or a \"veto\" by a permanent member prevents\nadoption of a proposal, even if it has received the required votes. Abstention\nis not regarded as a veto in most cases, though all five permanent members\nmust vote for adopting any amendment of the UN Charter. Procedural matters\ncannot be vetoed, so the veto right cannot be used to avoid discussion of an\nissue. The same holds for certain non-binding decisions that directly regard\npermanent members. Most vetoes have been used for blocking a candidate for\nSecretary-General or the admission of a member state, not in critical\ninternational security situations.\n\nIn the negotiations leading up to the creation of the UN, the veto power was\nopposed by many small countries and was in fact forced on them by the veto\nnations\u2014the United States, the United Kingdom, China, France, and the Soviet\nUnion\u2014by threatening that the UN would otherwise not be founded. Francis O.\nWilcox, an adviser to the US delegation to the 1945 conference, described the\nsituation:\n\n> At San Francisco, the issue was made crystal clear by the leaders of the Big\n> Five: it was either the Charter with the veto or no Charter at all. Senator\n> Connally [from the U.S. delegation] dramatically tore up a copy of the\n> Charter during one of his speeches and reminded the small states that they\n> would be guilty of that same act if they opposed the unanimity principle.\n> \"You may, if you wish,\" he said, \"go home from this Conference and say that\n> you have defeated the veto. But what will be your answer when you are asked:\n> 'Where is the Charter?'\"\n\nAs of 2012[update], 269 vetoes had been cast since the Security Council's\ninception. In this period, China used the veto 9 times, France 18, the Soviet\nUnion or Russia 128, the United Kingdom 32, and the United States 89. Roughly\ntwo-thirds of Soviet and Russian combined vetoes were in the first ten years\nof the Security Council's existence. Between 1996 and 2012, the United States\nvetoed 13 resolutions, Russia 7, and China 5, whilst France and the United\nKingdom did not use the veto.\n\nAn early veto by Soviet Commissar Andrei Vishinsky blocked a resolution on the\nwithdrawal of French forces from Syria and Lebanon which were under French\nmandate in February 1946; this veto established the precedent that permanent\nmembers could use the veto on matters outside of immediate concerns of war and\npeace. The Soviet Union went on to veto matters including the admission of\nAustria, Cambodia, Ceylon, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Laos, Libya, Nepal,\nPortugal, South Vietnam and Transjordan as UN member states, delaying their\njoining by several years. The United Kingdom and France used the veto to avoid\nSecurity Council condemnation of their actions in the 1956 Suez Crisis. The\nfirst veto by the United States came in 1970, blocking General Assembly action\nin Southern Rhodesia. From 1985 to 1990, the US vetoed 27 resolutions,\nprimarily to block resolutions perceived as anti-Israel but also to protect\nits interests in Panama and Korea. The Soviet Union, the United States and\nChina have all vetoed candidates for Secretary-General, with the US using the\nveto to block the re-election of Boutros Boutros-Ghali in 1996."

The chamber was designed by the\nNorwegian architect Arnstein Arneberg and was a gift from Norway. The United\nNations Security Council mural by Norwegian artist Per Krohg (1952) depicts a\nphoenix rising from its ashes, symbolic of the world's rebirth after World War\nII.\n\nThe Security Council has also held meetings in cities including Nairobi,\nKenya; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Panama City, Panama; and Geneva, Switzerland. In\nMarch 2010, the Security Council moved into a temporary facility in the\nGeneral Assembly Building as its chamber underwent renovations as part of the\nUN Capital Master Plan. The renovations were funded by Norway, the chamber's\noriginal donor, for a total cost of US$5 million. The chamber reopened on 16\nApril 2013. The representatives of the member states are seated on a\nhorseshoe-shaped table, with the president in the very middle flanked by the\nSecretary on the right and the Undersecretary on the left. The other\nrepresentatives are placed in clockwise order alphabetically from the\npresident leaving two seats at the ends of the table for guest speakers. The\nseating order of the members is then rotated each month as the presidency\nchanges.\n\nBecause of the public nature of meetings in the **Security Council Chamber** ,\ndelegations use the chamber to voice their positions in different ways, such\nas with walkouts."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Due to the public scrutiny of the Security Council Chamber, much of the work\nof the Security Council is conducted behind closed doors in \"informal\nconsultations\".\n\nIn 1978, West Germany funded the construction of a conference room next to the\nSecurity Council Chamber. The room was used for \"informal consultations\",\nwhich soon became the primary meeting format for the Security Council. In\n1994, the French ambassador complained to the Secretary-General that \"informal\nconsultations have become the Council's characteristic working method, whilst\npublic meetings, originally the norm, are increasingly rare and increasingly\ndevoid of content: everyone knows that when the Council goes into public\nmeeting everything has been decided in advance\". When Russia funded the\nrenovation of the consultation room in 2013, the Russian ambassador called it\n\"quite simply, the most fascinating place in the entire diplomatic universe\".\n\nOnly members of the Security Council are permitted in the conference room for\nconsultations. The press is not admitted, and other members of the United\nNations cannot be invited into the consultations. No formal record is kept of\nthe informal consultations. As a result, the delegations can negotiate with\neach other in secret, striking deals and compromises without having their\nevery word transcribed into the permanent record. The privacy of the\nconference room also makes it possible for the delegates to deal with each\nother in a friendly manner. In one early consultation, a new delegate from a\nCommunist nation began a propaganda attack on the United States, only to be\ntold by the Soviet delegate, \"We don't talk that way in here.\"\n\nA permanent member can cast a \"pocket veto\" during the informal consultation\nby declaring its opposition to a measure. Since a veto would prevent the\nresolution from being passed, the sponsor will usually refrain from putting\nthe resolution to a vote. Resolutions are vetoed only if the sponsor feels so\nstrongly about a measure that it wishes to force the permanent member to cast\na formal veto. By the time a resolution reaches the Security Council Chamber,\nit has already been discussed, debated and amended in the consultations. The\nopen meeting of the Security Council is merely a public ratification of a\ndecision that has already been reached in private. For example, Resolution\n1373 was adopted without public debate in a meeting that lasted just five\nminutes.\n\nThe Security Council holds far more consultations than public meetings. In\n2012, the Security Council held 160 consultations, 16 private meetings and 9\npublic meetings. In times of crisis, the Security Council still meets\nprimarily in consultations, but it also holds more public meetings. After the\noutbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2014, the Security Council returned to\nthe patterns of the Cold War, as Russia and the Western countries engaged in\nverbal duels in front of the television cameras. In 2016, the Security Council\nheld 150 consultations, 19 private meetings and 68 public meetings."

        "generated_section_content_md": "After approval by the Security Council, the UN may send peacekeepers to\nregions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the\nterms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming\nhostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping\nforces are voluntarily provided by member states. These soldiers are sometimes\nnicknamed \"Blue Helmets\" for their distinctive gear. The peacekeeping force as\na whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.\n\nSouth African soldiers patrolling as part of MONUSCO in 2018\n\nAs of 28 February 2023, the UN had 86,903 uniformed and civilian personnel\nserving in 12 peacekeeping missions, with 121 countries contributing military\npersonnel. The largest was the United Nations Organization Stabilization\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), which included\n20,688 uniformed personnel. The smallest, United Nations Military Observer\nGroup in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), included 42 uniformed personnel\nresponsible for monitoring the ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir. Peacekeepers\nwith the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) have been\nstationed in the Middle East since 1948, the longest-running active\npeacekeeping mission.\n\nUN peacekeepers have also drawn criticism in several postings. Peacekeepers\nhave been accused of child rape, soliciting prostitutes, or sexual abuse\nduring various peacekeeping missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,\nHaiti, Liberia, Sudan and what is now South Sudan, Burundi and Ivory Coast.\nScientists cited UN peacekeepers from Nepal as the likely source of the\n2010\u20132013 Haiti cholera outbreak, which killed more than 8,000 Haitians\nfollowing the 2010 Haiti earthquake.\n\nThe budget for peacekeeping is assessed separately from the main UN\norganisational budget; in the fiscal year 1 July 2021 \u2013 30 June 2022,\npeacekeeping expenditures amounted for $6.38 billion. UN peace operations are\nfunded by assessments, using a formula derived from the regular funding scale,\nbut including a weighted surcharge for the five permanent Security Council\nmembers. This surcharge serves to offset discounted peacekeeping assessment\nrates for less-developed countries.\n\nThis amount finances 10 of the 12 ongoing UN peacekeeping missions, along the\nliquidation of the UN African Union Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID) and\nlogistics support for the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), providing\nthe technology, logistics and general support to all peace operations through\nglobal service centres in Brindisi (Italy) and a regional service centre in\nEntebbe (Uganda). The UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) and the UN\nMilitary Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) are excluded from the\nPeacekeeping Operations budget and are financed through the regular UN budget.\n\nFor the 2020\u20132021 budget, the top 10 providers of assessed financial\ncontributions to United Nations peacekeeping operations were the US (27.89%),\nChina (15.21%), Japan (8.56%), Germany (6.09%), the United Kingdom (5.79%),\nFrance (5.61%), Italy (3.30%), Russian Federation (3.04%), Canada (2.73%) and\nSouth Korea (2.26%)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In examining the first sixty years of the Security Council's existence,\nBritish historian Paul Kennedy concludes that \"glaring failures had not only\naccompanied the UN's many achievements, they overshadowed them\", identifying\nas particular failures the lack of will to prevent ethnic massacres in Bosnia\nand Rwanda. Kennedy attributes the failures to the UN's lack of reliable\nmilitary resources, writing that \"above all, one can conclude that the\npractice of announcing (through a Security Council resolution) a new\npeacekeeping mission without ensuring that sufficient armed forces will be\navailable has usually proven to be a recipe for humiliation and disaster.\"\n\nSeveral studies have examined the Security Council's responsiveness to armed\nconflict. Findings suggests that the Council is more likely to meet and\ndeliberate on conflicts that are more intense and have led to more\nhumanitarian suffering, but that its responsiveness is also shaped by the\npolitical interests of member states and in particular of the permanent\nmembers.\n\nA 2005 RAND Corporation study found the UN to be successful in two out of\nthree peacekeeping efforts. It compared UN nation-building efforts to those of\nthe United States, and found that 88% of UN cases had led to lasting peace.\nAlso in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of\nwars, genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and\npresented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism\u2014mostly\nspearheaded by the UN\u2014had been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict\nsince the end of the Cold War.\n\nScholar Sudhir Chella Rajan argued in 2006 that the five permanent members of\nthe Security Council, all of which are nuclear powers, had created an\nexclusive nuclear club that predominantly addresses the strategic interests\nand political motives of the permanent members\u2014for example, protecting the\noil-rich Kuwaitis in 1991 but poorly protecting the resource-poor Rwandans in\n1994. Since three of the five permanent members are European, and four are\npredominantly white developed nations, the Security Council has been described\nas a pillar of global apartheid by Titus Alexander, former Chair of the\nWestminster United Nations Association.\n\nThe Security Council's effectiveness and relevance are questioned by some\nbecause, in most high-profile cases, there are essentially no consequences for\nviolating a Security Council resolution. During the Darfur crisis, Janjaweed\nmilitias, allowed by elements of the Sudanese government, committed violence\nagainst an indigenous population, killing thousands of civilians. In the\nSrebrenica massacre, Serbian troops committed genocide against Bosniaks,\nalthough Srebrenica had been declared a UN safe area, protected by 400 armed\nDutch peacekeepers.\n\nThe UN Charter gives all three powers of the legislative, executive and\njudiciary branches to the Security Council.\n\nIn his inaugural speech at the 16th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in\nAugust 2012, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized the Security Council as having\nan \"illogical, unjust and completely undemocratic structure and mechanism\" and\ncalled for a complete reform of the body.\n\nThe Security Council has been criticized for failure in resolving many\nconflicts\u2014including Cyprus, Sri Lanka, Syria, Kosovo, and the\nIsraeli\u2013Palestinian conflict\u2014reflecting the wider shortcomings of the UN. For\nexample, at the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly, New Zealand Prime\nMinister John Key heavily criticized the UN's inaction on Syria, more than two\nyears after the Syrian civil war had begun.\n\nThere is evidence of bribery in the Security Council. Countries that are\nelected to the Security Council see a large increase in foreign aid from the\nUS, averaging 59%. They also see an 8% increase in aid from the UN, mainly\nfrom UNICEF. The increase most strongly correlates to years in which the\nSecurity Council addresses issues relevant to the US. There is also evidence\nof increased foreign aid to elected countries from Japan and Germany. One\nstudy found membership on the Security Council correlates with reduced\neconomic growth for a given country over the course of its two-year term\u20143.5%\ngrowth during membership compared to 8.7% over four years of non-\nmembership\u2014although the effect is mainly driven by African authoritarian\ncountries. Elected members also experience a reduction in democracy and\nfreedom of the press.\n\nIn June 2025, Pakistan became a non-permanent member for 2 years, and was\nelected as vice chair of the Council\u2019s Counter-Terrorism Committee, along with\nchair of the Security Council committee overseeing sanctions against the\nTaliban. The decision earned backlash from several nations, including India,\nas Pakistan has been accused of harboring several UN designated terrorists."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The G4 nations: Brazil, Germany, India, Japan The Uniting for Consensus:\nItaly, Pakistan, Spain, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Turkey, South Korea and\nothers\n\nProposals to reform the Security Council began with the conference that wrote\nthe UN Charter and have continued to the present day. As British historian\nPaul Kennedy writes, \"Everyone agrees that the present structure is flawed.\nBut consensus on how to fix it remains out of reach.\"\n\nThere has been discussion of increasing the number of permanent members. The\ncountries which have made the strongest demands for permanent seats are\nBrazil, Germany, India and Japan. Japan and Germany, the main defeated powers\nin WWII, had been the UN's second- and third-largest funders, respectively,\nbefore China took over as the second largest funder in recent years, whilst\nBrazil and India are two of the largest contributors of troops to UN-mandated\npeace-keeping missions.\n\nItaly, another main defeated power in WWII and now the UN's sixth-largest\nfunder, leads a movement known as Uniting for Consensus in opposition to the\npossible expansion of permanent seats. Core members of the group include\nCanada, South Korea, Spain, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan, Turkey, Argentina and\nColombia. Their proposal is to create a new category of seats, still non-\npermanent, but elected for an extended duration (semi-permanent seats). As far\nas traditional categories of seats are concerned, the UfC proposal does not\nimply any change, but only the introduction of small and medium size states\namongst groups eligible for regular seats. This proposal includes even the\nquestion of veto, giving a range of options that goes from abolition to\nlimitation of the application of the veto only to Chapter VII matters.\n\nFormer UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan asked a team of advisers to come up\nwith recommendations for reforming the United Nations by the end of 2004. One\nproposed measure is to increase the number of permanent members by five,\nwhich, in most proposals, would include Brazil, Germany, India and Japan\n(known as the G4 nations), one seat from Africa (most likely between Egypt,\nNigeria or South Africa), and/or one seat from the Arab League. On 21\nSeptember 2004, the G4 nations issued a joint statement mutually backing each\nother's claim to permanent status, together with two African countries.\nCurrently the proposal has to be accepted by two-thirds of the General\nAssembly (128 votes).\n\nThe permanent members, each holding the right of veto, announced their\npositions on Security Council reform reluctantly. The United States has\nunequivocally supported the permanent membership of Japan and lent its support\nto India and a small number of additional non-permanent members. The United\nKingdom and France have essentially supported the G4 position, with the\nexpansion of permanent and non-permanent members and the accession of Germany,\nBrazil, India and Japan to permanent member status, as well as an increase in\nthe presence of African countries on the Council. China has supported stronger\nrepresentation of developing countries and has firmly opposed Japan's\nmembership.\n\nIn 2017, it was reported that the G4 nations were willing temporarily to forgo\nveto power if granted permanent UNSC seats. In September 2017, US\nRepresentatives Ami Bera and Frank Pallone introduced a resolution (H.Res.535)\nin the US House of Representatives (115th United States Congress), seeking\nsupport for the elevation of India to permanent membership of the United\nNations Security Council.\n\nWhilst discussions on expanding permanent membership to individual nations\nsuch as the G4 continue, alternative proposals have been put forward to\nreconsider the structure of the Security Council. The Noble World Foundation\n(NWF) proposes a novel approach, suggesting that UNSC membership and veto\npower be shifted from individual states to sovereignty-pooling organizations\nlike the European Union (EU). This proposal aligns with the UNSC's practice of\nregionally-based selection of non-permanent members, aiming to improve the\nCouncil's decision-making and effectiveness. The EU serves as a primary\nexample of such pooled sovereignty, especially following the European Court of\nJustice's 1964 ruling that established the precedence of EU law over national\nlaws of its member states. The NWF advocates that regional entities like the\nEU could be eligible for UN membership in the Security Council, enabling a\nsignificant reform without necessitating an amendment to the UN Charter.\n\nIn 2025, at the 17th BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\u2019s outgoing BRICS\npresident, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, and India\u2019s Prime Minister\nNarendra Modi emphasized their shared ambition to secure permanent membership\non the UNSC. Modi highlighted the need for reforming the UNSC to enhance its\ncredibility and effectiveness by better representing the Global South, noting\nthat many key economies remain excluded from decision-making. Both leaders\naffirmed that reforming the UNSC would be a priority for India during its\nupcoming BRICS presidency in 2026."
