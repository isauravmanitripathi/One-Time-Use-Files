        "generated_section_content_md": "International police organization\n\nLaw enforcement agency\n\nThe **International Criminal Police Organization \u2013 INTERPOL** (abbreviated as\n**ICPO\u2013INTERPOL**), commonly known as **Interpol** (UK: /\u02c8\u026ant\u0259rp\u0252l/ _IN -t\u0259r-\npol_, US: /-po\u028al/ _-\u2060pohl_; stylized in allcaps), is an international\norganization that facilitates worldwide police cooperation and crime control.\nIt is the world's largest international police organization. It is\nheadquartered in Lyon, France, with seven regional bureaus worldwide, and a\nNational Central Bureau in all 196 member states.\n\nThe organization today known as Interpol was founded on 7 September 1923 at\nthe close of a five-day International Police Congress in Vienna as the\n**International Criminal Police Commission** (**ICPC**); it adopted many of\nits current duties throughout the 1930s. After coming under Nazi control in\n1938, the agency had its headquarters in the same building as the Gestapo. It\nwas effectively stagnant until the end of World War II. In 1956, the ICPC\nadopted a new constitution and the name Interpol, derived from its telegraphic\naddress used since 1946.\n\nInterpol provides investigative support, expertise and training to law\nenforcement worldwide, focusing on three major areas of transnational crime:\nterrorism, cybercrime and organized crime. Its broad mandate covers virtually\nevery kind of crime, including crimes against humanity, child pornography,\ndrug trafficking and production, political corruption, intellectual property\ninfringement, as well as white-collar crime. The agency also facilitates\ncooperation among national law enforcement institutions through criminal\ndatabases and communications networks. Contrary to popular belief, Interpol is\nitself not a law enforcement agency.\n\nInterpol has an annual budget of \u20ac142 million ($155 million), most of which\ncomes from annual contributions by member police forces in 181 countries. It\nis governed by a General Assembly composed of all member countries, which\nelects the executive committee and the president (currently Ahmed Naser Al-\nRaisi of the United Arab Emirates) to supervise and implement Interpol's\npolicies and administration. Day-to-day operations are carried out by the\nGeneral Secretariat, comprising around 1,000 personnel from over 100\ncountries, including both police and civilians. The Secretariat is led by the\nsecretary-general, currently Valdecy Urquiza, the former vice president of\nInterpol for the Americas.\n\nPursuant to its charter, Interpol seeks to remain politically neutral in\nfulfilling its mandate, and is thus barred from interventions or activities\nthat are political, military, religious, or racial in nature and from\ninvolving itself in disputes over such matters. The agency operates in four\nlanguages: Arabic, English, French and Spanish."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Until the 19th century, cooperation among police in different national and\npolitical jurisdictions was organized largely on an ad hoc basis, focused on a\nspecific goal or criminal enterprise. The earliest attempt at a formal,\npermanent framework for international police coordination was the Police Union\nof German States, formed in 1851 to bring together police from various German-\nspeaking states. Its activities were centered mostly on political dissidents\nand criminals. A similar plan was launched by Italy in the 1898 Anti-Anarchist\nConference of Rome, which brought delegates from 21 European countries to\ncreate a formal structure for addressing the international anarchist movement.\nNeither the conference nor its follow up meeting in St. Petersburg in 1904\nyielded results.\n\nInterpol headquarters in the 6th arrondissement of Lyon, France\n\nThe early 20th century saw several attempts to formalize international police\ncooperation, driven by increasing international travel and commerce, which\nfacilitated transnational criminal enterprises and fugitives on the run. The\nfirst major effort was the International Criminal Police Congress, held in\nMonaco in 1914. This event brought diplomats and legal officials from two\ndozen countries to discuss international collaboration in criminal\ninvestigations, the sharing of investigative techniques, and extradition\nprocedures. The Monaco Congress outlined twelve principles that would\neventually form the foundation of Interpol, such as establishing direct\ncommunication between police forces in different countries, creating\ninternational standards for forensics and data collection, and streamlining\nthe process for handling extradition requests. However, the idea of an\ninternational police organization remained inactive during the First World\nWar. In 1922, the United States attempted a similar initiative through the\nInternational Police Conference in New York City, but it failed to garner\ninternational support.\n\nA year later, in 1923, a new initiative was undertaken at another\nInternational Criminal Police Congress in Vienna, spearheaded by Johannes\nSchober, President of the Viennese Police Department. The 22 delegates agreed\nto found the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), the direct\nforerunner of Interpol, which would be based in Vienna. Founding members\nincluded police officials from Austria, Germany, Belgium, Poland, China,\nEgypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Romania,\nSweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia. The same year, wanted person notices were\nfirst published in the ICPCs International Public Safety Journal. The United\nKingdom joined in 1928. By 1934, the ICPC's membership more than doubled to 58\nnations.[_citation needed_]. The United States did not join Interpol until\n1938, although a U.S. police officer unofficially attended the 1923 congress.\n\nFollowing the _Anschluss_ in 1938, the Vienna-based organization fell under\nthe control of Nazi Germany; on November 29, 1941, Interpol had offices at _Am\nKleinen Wannsee 16_ ; the commission\u2019s headquarters were eventually moved to\nBerlin in 1942. Most member states withdrew their support during this period.\nFrom 1938 to 1945, the presidents of the ICPC included Otto Steinh\u00e4usl,\nReinhard Heydrich, Arthur Nebe and Ernst Kaltenbrunner. All were generals in\nthe _Schutzstaffel_ (SS); Kaltenbrunner was the highest-ranking SS officer\nexecuted following the Nuremberg trials.\n\nIn 1946, after the end of World War II, the organization was revived as the\nInternational Criminal Police Organization (ICPO) by officials from Belgium,\nFrance, Scandinavia, the United States and the United Kingdom. Its new\nheadquarters were established in Paris, then from 1967 in Saint-Cloud, a\nParisian suburb. They remained there until 1989 when they were moved to their\npresent location in Lyon.\n\nUntil the 1980s, Interpol did not intervene in the prosecution of Nazi war\ncriminals in accordance with Article 3 of its Charter, which prohibited\nintervention in \"political\" matters.\n\nOn May 10, 2023, Operation Identify Me was launched."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Contrary to the common idea due to frequent portrayals in popular media,\nInterpol is not a supranational law enforcement agency and has no agents with\narresting powers. Instead, it is an international organization that functions\nas a network of law enforcement agencies from different countries. The\norganization thus functions as an administrative liaison among the law\nenforcement agencies of the member countries, providing communications and\ndatabase assistance, mostly through its central headquarters in Lyon, along\nwith the assistance of smaller local bureaus in each of its member states.\n\nInterpol's databases at the Lyon headquarters can assist law enforcement in\nfighting international crime. While national agencies have their own extensive\ncrime databases, the information rarely extends beyond one nation's borders.\nInterpol's databases can track criminals and crime trends around the world,\nspecifically by means of authorized collections of fingerprints and face\nphotos, lists of wanted persons, DNA samples, and travel documents. Interpol's\nlost and stolen travel document database alone contains more than 12 million\nrecords. Officials at the headquarters also analyze this data and release\ninformation on crime trends to the member countries.\n\nAn encrypted Internet-based worldwide communications network allows Interpol\nagents and member countries to contact each other at any time. Known as\nI-24/7, the network offers constant access to Interpol's databases. While the\nNational Central Bureaus are the primary access sites to the network, some\nmember countries have expanded it to key areas such as airports and border\naccess points. Member countries can also access each other's criminal\ndatabases via the I-24/7 system.\n\nInterpol issues eight types of Interpol notices, seven of which are: red,\nblue, green, yellow, black, orange, and purple. An eighth special notice is\nissued at the special request of the United Nations Security Council. As of\n2019[update], there were 62,448 valid Red and 12,234 Yellow notices in\ncirculation.\n\nIn the event of an international disaster, terrorist attack, or assassination,\nInterpol can send an Incident Response Team (IRT). IRTs can offer a range of\nexpertise and database access to assist with victim identification, suspect\nidentification, and the dissemination of information to other nations' law\nenforcement agencies. In addition, at the request of local authorities, they\ncan act as a central command and logistics operation to coordinate other law\nenforcement agencies involved in a case. Such teams were deployed eight times\nin 2013. Interpol began issuing its own travel documents in 2009 with hopes\nthat nations would remove visa requirements for individuals travelling for\nInterpol business, thereby improving response times. In September 2017, the\norganization voted to accept Palestine and the Solomon Islands as members."

The election was\ncontroversial due to the UAE\u2019s human rights record, with concerns being raised\nby some human rights groups (e.g. Human Rights Watch) and some MEPs.\n\nIn June 2021, 35 French Parliamentarians, Members of Parliament and Senators,\nincluding from the majority and the opposition, urged President Emmanuel\nMacron to oppose the candidacy of the UAE's General Ahmed Nasser Al-Raisi,\nciting the accusations of torture against him. It was the second appeal by the\ndeputy of the Rh\u00f4ne, Hubert Julien-Laferri\u00e8re, who had first written to Macron\nearlier in 2021. He questioned how a profile like Al-Raisi's, who was\nresponsible for the torture of political opponent Ahmed Mansoor and of a\nBritish academic Matthew Hedges, can become the president of a most\nrespectable institution.\n\nWhile the UAE was arranging trips for Al-Raisi to Interpol's member countries,\nopposition against the Emirati candidate amplified. A number of German MPs\nsigned a petition to express \"deep concern\" and reject the candidacy of Al-\nRaisi for the post of Interpol director. Rodney Dixon, the British lawyer of\nMatthew Hedges and Ali Ahmad, submitted a complaint and urged the Swedish\nauthorities to arrest Al-Raisi upon his arrival in Sweden. The two Britons\nalso raised a similar request to arrest al-Raisi with the Norwegian police\nauthorities. Both Sweden and Norway apply jurisdiction that allows them to\nopen investigations of crime, irrespective of a person's nationality or the\norigin country of the crime.\n\nIn October 2021, Al-Raisi had to face further opposition, as the lawyers\nsubmitted a complaint to the French Prosecutor in Paris. The claims cited Al-\nRaisi's role in the unlawful detention and torture of Ali Issa Ahmad and\nMatthew Hedges. Filed under the principle of universal jurisdiction, the\ncomplaint gave French officials the authority to investigate and arrest\nforeign nationals. As Raisi is not a head of state, French authorities had all\nthe rights to arrest and question him on entering the French territory.\n\nAs the General Assembly was approaching, the opposition was rising. In\nNovember 2021, a Turkish lawyer Gulden Sonmez filed a criminal complaint\nagainst Al-Raisi's nomination in Turkey, where the vote was to take place.\nSonmez said the Emirates' attempt to cover its human rights records and to\nlaunder its reputation. Besides, Hedges and Ahmad were also expected to file a\nlawsuit in Turkey against Al-Raisi, ahead of the General Assembly."

In\n2014, Russia made attempts to place Ukrainian politician Ihor Kolomoyskyi and\nUkrainian civic activist Pavel Ushevets, subject to criminal persecution in\nRussia following his pro-Ukrainian art performance in Moscow, on the Interpol\nwanted list.\n\nOn October 30, 2023, Belarusian filmmaker Andrey Gnyot got arrested when he\nlanded in Belgrade as he was put on an Interpol warrant list. He is accused by\nthe Belarusian authorities of tax evasion and issued an extradition request.\nDuring the 2020\u20132021 Belarusian protests, Gnyot co-founded the Free\nAssociation of Athletes (SOS-BY), bringing together athletes opposed to the\nLukashenko regime. He spent seven months in detention in Belgrade before being\ntransferred to house arrest in June 2024. Amnesty International called on the\nSerbian authorities to cease the extradition process."

On 17 March 2018, the Czech authorities dismissed Turkey's request as\nlacking merit.[_citation needed_]\n\nAfter a senior UAE government official, Ahmed Naser Al-Raisi became the\nPresident, Interpol ignored an injunction by the European Court of Human\nRights (ECHR), and cooperated with Serbian authorities to extradite a Bahraini\nactivist. Ahmed Jaafar Mohamed Ali was extradited to Bahrain in a charter\naircraft of Royal Jet, a private Emirati airline headed by an Abu Dhabi royal\nfamily member. Critics raised concerns that it was just first example of how\n\"red lines will be crossed\" under the presidency of Al-Raisi. Besides, a\nwarning was raised that after its decision, Interpol will be complicit in any\nabuse that Ali will face. In 2021 it was reported that Ahmed Naser had also\nallegedly tortured a number of people in the UAE before."
