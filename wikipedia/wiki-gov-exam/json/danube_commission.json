It was established in 1948 by seven\ncountries bordering the river, replacing previous commissions that had also\nincluded representatives of non-riparian powers. Its predecessor commissions\nwere among the first attempts at internationalizing the police powers of\nsovereign states for a common cause.\n\nMembers include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany,\nHungary, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.\n\nThe commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856, which established for\nthe first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the\nDanube, and of 1921, which resurrected the international regime after the\nFirst World War."

        "generated_section_content_md": "When the treaty was adopted, Yugoslavia had already been expelled from the\nCominform, the political grouping of all the Communist parties in the Soviet\nbloc. Yet it still voted down the line with the other non-Western countries,\nnearly 200 miles of the Danube flowing through its territory and the only\nnavigable channel through the Iron Gate being on the Yugoslav side of the\nRomanian border. Nevertheless, when the new commission organized its staff,\nthe Yugoslavs were offered only four minor posts out of sixty permanent\nappointments. The Josip Broz Tito government refused them all.\n\nThe commission also fixed freight rates that allegedly discriminated against\nYugoslavia, Belgrade officials said. Faced with this situation,\n\n> the Yugoslav delegate to the commission has been most uncooperative. He has\n> been a minority of one on every major question that has come up for\n> discussion. He opposed, for example, the creation of a special\n> _administration fluviale_ [river administration] run by a joint\n> Czechoslovak\u2013Hungarian Commission to control the difficult Gabcikovo\u2013G\u00f6ny\u0171\n> sector\u2026 The Yugoslavs lost by six votes to one. But they have at least got\n> their own back by refusing to pay their share of the commission's expenses.\n\nAnother report, however, stated that it was the commission itself that \"had\nmade a determined effort to avoid accepting Yugoslavia's share in the\nexpenses,\" which were even larger than the Yugoslav contribution to the United\nNations.\n\nThese grievances were compounded by the vast powers wielded by the Soviet\nUnion. At the session of November 11, 1949, a Soviet proposal was adopted\nvesting complete powers of appointment, organization, leadership, and\nnegotiation in the secretary, who was the Russian representative. By 1950,\n\n> the Soviet government [had] assumed complete control over the Commission's\n> administrative machinery and reduced the other governments to nominal\n> status\u2026 Yugoslav representatives [had] been excluded from every important\n> committee.\n\nAt the May 1951 meeting, the Yugoslavs walked out, forcing adjournment. They\nwere protesting the \"railroading\" of shipping regulations they thought would\nhurt their economy: a rule forbidding inspection of foreign ships by the\nnations through which they were passing. The Yugoslavs charged sabotage and\ninfiltration by Soviet agents aboard the ships. In August, Yugoslavia told the\nUSSR in a note that the commission's rules were \"contrary in letter and\nspirit\" to the 1948 convention, giving the Soviets control of the waterway in\nviolation of national sovereignty.\n\nAt the commission's fifth session, in June 1952, Yugoslavia proposed the\nestablishment of an executive committee to be composed of one representative\nfrom each country; it would control business between formal sessions of the\ncommission. The Soviet bloc voted to study the plan \"sometime between the\nsixth and seventh sessions.\" Next, Yugoslavia proposed that the top posts\nshould be rotated among the six members every three years, but the commission\nrejected that suggestion in June 1953. Rumors sprang up that Yugoslavia would\nresign from the commission because of this treatment.\n\nSlowly, though, the picture changed with a thaw in Yugoslav\u2013Soviet relations.\nOn December 15, 1953, Dragoje Djuric, a Yugoslav diplomat, was elected to the\nsecretary's post, a Hungarian was named president and a Bulgarian vice\npresident. A Belgrade spokesman said in glee that the sessions were unusually\nharmonious because the Iron Curtain countries were agreeing to \"all proposals\nput on the agenda by the Yugoslavs,\" one of them being a Yugoslav\u2013Hungarian\nproposal to move the commission's headquarters in 1954 from Galatz to\nBudapest.\n\nLater, though, the Soviet bloc intimated the downgrading of the Danube\nCommission. A Vienna dispatch reported that the Council for Mutual Economic\nAssistance (Comecon), the Eastern European equivalent of the Marshall Plan,\nhad created a new, permanent Danube committee of its own, its purpose to draft\nmeasures for using Danube water for power, irrigation, and navigation. It\nordered at a Moscow meeting that plans be made to raise the level of the river\nby dams so seagoing ships could move farther upstream."

Slovakia took over half\nof the project on 1 December 1993 when the country split however Hungary had\nabandoned the project in 1989 and tried to get out of the agreement. The\nInternational Court of Justice was called upon to judge the case and found\nHungary had breached their legal obligations in almost all points, ordering\nthat the project be completed.
