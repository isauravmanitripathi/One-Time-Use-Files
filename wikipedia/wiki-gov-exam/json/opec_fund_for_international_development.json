A Solemn Declaration of the Conference \"reaffirmed the natural\nsolidarity which unites OPEC countries with other developing countries in\ntheir struggle to overcome underdevelopment\", and called for measures to\nstrengthen cooperation between these countries.\n\nThe OPEC Fund's objective is to reinforce financial cooperation between OPEC\nMember Countries and other developing countries, by providing financial\nsupport to the latter for their socioeconomic development. The institution's\ncentral mission is to foster South-South Partnership with fellow developing\ncountries worldwide with the aim of eradicating poverty. OPEC Fund's\nheadquarters are located in Vienna, Austria. The current president and chief\nexecutive officer is Dr. Abdulhamid Alkhalifa of Saudi Arabia, who assumed\noffice on November 1, 2018."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Following the First OPEC Summit in Algiers, Algeria, in 1975, Member Countries\nexpressed their commitment to assist the developing countries through a\ncollective financial facility. As a result, in 1976, the Finance Ministers of\nMember Countries met and established the OPEC Special Fund, through which\nMember Countries would channel aid to developing countries. The OPEC Special\nFund started its operations in 1976, with initial resources of about $800\nmillion. By the end of 1977 it had extended 71 loans to 58 developing\ncountries, and had channeled donations from its Member Countries to other\ndevelopment institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\nTrust Fund and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).\n\nAs a result of its successful performance, member countries decided in 1980 to\nconvert the temporary facility into a permanent legal entity called the OPEC\nFund for International Development; it became a permanent international\ndevelopment agency in May 1980. The institution ceased using the abbreviation\nOFID in 2020."
