It was founded on 14 September 1960 in\nBaghdad by the first five members: Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and\nVenezuela. The organization, which currently comprises 12 member countries,\naccounted for 38 percent of global oil production, according to a 2022 report.\nAdditionally, it is estimated that 79.5 percent of the world's proven oil\nreserves are located within OPEC nations, with the Middle East alone\naccounting for 67.2 percent of OPEC's total reserves.\n\nIn a series of steps in the 1960s and 1970s, OPEC restructured the global\nsystem of oil production in favor of oil-producing states and away from an\noligopoly of dominant Anglo-American oil firms (the \"Seven Sisters\"). In the\n1970s, restrictions in oil production led to a dramatic rise in oil prices\nwith long-lasting and far-reaching consequences for the global economy. Since\nthe 1980s, OPEC has had a limited impact on world oil-supply and oil-price\nstability, as there is frequent cheating by members on their commitments to\none another, and as member commitments reflect what they would do even in the\nabsence of OPEC.\n\nThe formation of OPEC marked a turning point toward national sovereignty over\nnatural resources. OPEC decisions have come to play a prominent role in the\nglobal oil market and in international relations. Economists have\ncharacterized OPEC as a textbook example of a cartel (a group whose members\ncooperate to reduce market competition) but one whose consultations may be\nprotected by the doctrine of state immunity under international law.\n\nThe current OPEC members are[ref] Algeria, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Iran,\nIraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Saudi Arabia, the\nUnited Arab Emirates and Venezuela. The former members are Angola, Ecuador,\nIndonesia, and Qatar. **OPEC+** is a larger group consisting of OPEC members\nand other oil-producing countries; it was formed in late 2016 to better\ncontrol the global crude oil market. Canada, Egypt, Norway, and Oman are\nobserver states."

Prior to the creation\nof OPEC, individual oil-producing states were punished for taking steps to\nalter the governing arrangements of oil production within their borders.\nStates were coerced militarily (e.g. in 1953, the US-UK-sponsored a coup\nagainst Mohammad Mosaddegh after he nationalized Iran's oil production) or\neconomically (e.g. the Seven Sisters slowed down oil production in one non-\ncompliant state and ramped up oil production elsewhere) when acted contrary to\nthe interests of the Seven Sisters and their governments.\n\nThe organisational logic that underpins OPEC is that it is in the collective\ninterest of its members to limit the world oil supply in order to reap higher\nprices. However, the main problem within OPEC is that it is individually\nrational for members to cheat on commitments and produce as much oil as\npossible.\n\nPolitical scientist Jeff Colgan has argued that OPEC has since the 1980s\nlargely failed to achieve its goals (limits on world oil supply, stabilized\nprices, and raising of long-term average revenues). He finds that members have\ncheated on 96% of their commitments. The analysis spans over the period\n1982\u20132009. To the extent that when member states comply with their\ncommitments, it is because the commitments reflect what they would do even if\nOPEC did not exist. One large reason for the frequent cheating is that OPEC\ndoes not punish members for non-compliance with commitments.\n\nIn June 2020, all countries participating in the OPEC+ framework collectively\nagreed to the introduction of a Compensation Mechanism aimed at ensuring full\nconformity with and adherence to the agreed-upon oil production cuts. This\ninitiative aligns with one of OPEC's stated objectives: to maintain a stable\noil market, which, notably, has been relatively more stable than other energy\ncommodities."

For instance, the US Energy Information Administration's\nglossary explains OPEC as:\n\n> An intergovernmental organization whose stated objective is to 'coordinate\n> and unify the petroleum policies of member countries'.\n\nThe _Oxford Dictionary of Energy Science_ (2017) defines OPEC as:\n\n> An organization set up in 1960 to coordinate petroleum policies among its\n> member countries, initially with the aim of securing a regular supply to\n> consuming countries at a price that gave a fair return on capital\n> investment.\n\nOPEC members strongly prefer to describe their organisation as a modest force\nfor market stabilisation, rather than a powerful anti-competitive cartel. In\nits defense, the organisation was founded as a counterweight against the\nprevious \"Seven Sisters\" cartel of multinational oil companies, and non-OPEC\nenergy suppliers have maintained enough market share for a substantial degree\nof worldwide competition. Moreover, because of an economic \"prisoner's\ndilemma\" that encourages each member nation individually to discount its price\nand exceed its production quota, widespread cheating within OPEC often erodes\nits ability to influence global oil prices through collective action.\nPolitical scientist Jeff Colgan has challenged that OPEC is a cartel, pointing\nto endemic cheating in the organization: \"A cartel needs to set tough goals\nand meet them; OPEC sets easy goals and fails to meet even those.\"\n\nOPEC has not been involved in any disputes related to the competition rules of\nthe World Trade Organization, even though the objectives, actions, and\nprinciples of the two organisations diverge considerably. A key US District\nCourt decision held that OPEC consultations are protected as \"governmental\"\nacts of state by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, and are therefore\nbeyond the legal reach of US competition law governing \"commercial\" acts.\nDespite popular sentiment against OPEC, legislative proposals to limit the\norganisation's sovereign immunity, such as the NOPEC Act, have so far been\nunsuccessful."

A further complication is that religion-linked conflicts in the Middle\nEast are recurring features of the geopolitical landscape for this oil-rich\nregion.

Government\nrepresentatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in\nBaghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their\ncountries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite\nstrong US opposition: \"Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia\nformed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the\nbest price available from the major oil corporations.\" The Middle Eastern\nmembers originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut,\nbut Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose\nGeneva, Switzerland. On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after\nSwitzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges. At the time, Switzerland\nwas attempting to reduce their foreign population and the OPEC was the first\nintergovernmental body to leave the country because of restrictions on\nforeigners. Austria was keen to attract international organizations and\noffered attractive terms to the OPEC.\n\nDuring the early years of OPEC, the oil-producing countries had a 50/50 profit\nagreement with the oil companies. OPEC bargained with the dominant oil\ncompanies (the Seven Sisters), but OPEC faced coordination problems among its\nmembers. If one OPEC member demanded too much from the oil companies, then the\noil companies could slow down production in that country and ramp up\nproduction elsewhere. The 50/50 agreements were still in place until 1970 when\nLibya negotiated a 58/42 agreement with the oil company Occidental, which\nprompted other OPEC members to request better agreements with oil companies.>\nIn 1971, an accord was signed between major oil companies and members of OPEC\ndoing business in the Mediterranean Sea region, called the _Tripoli\nAgreement_. The agreement, signed on 2 April 1971, raised oil prices and\nincreased producing countries' profit shares.\n\nDuring 1961\u20131975, the five founding nations were joined by Qatar (1961),\nIndonesia (1962\u20132008, rejoined 2014\u20132016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates\n(originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria\n(1971), Ecuador (1973\u20131992, 2007\u20132020), and Gabon (1975\u20131994, rejoined 2016).\nBy the early 1970s, OPEC's membership accounted for more than half of\nworldwide oil production. Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further\nexpansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's acting secretary general in 2006, urged\nhis African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join, and Angola did in 2007,\nfollowed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017. Since the 1980s, representatives from\nCanada, Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations\nhave attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for\ncoordinating policies."

One of the major fears for OPEC\nmembers was that nationalisation would cause a steep decline in the price of\noil. This prompted a wave of nationalisations in countries such as Libya,\nAlgeria, Iraq, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. With greater control over\noil production decisions and amid high oil prices, OPEC members unilaterally\nraised oil prices in 1973, prompting the 1973 oil crisis.\n\nIn October 1973, the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries\n(OAPEC, consisting of the Arab majority of OPEC plus Egypt and Syria) declared\nsignificant production cuts and an oil embargo against the United States and\nother industrialized nations that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. A\nprevious embargo attempt was largely ineffective in response to the Six-Day\nWar in 1967. However, in 1973, the result was a sharp rise in oil prices and\nOPEC revenues, from US$3/bbl to US$12/bbl, and an emergency period of energy\nrationing, intensified by panic reactions, a declining trend in US oil\nproduction, currency devaluations, and a lengthy UK coal-miners dispute. For a\ntime, the UK imposed an emergency three-day workweek. Seven European nations\nbanned non-essential Sunday driving. US gas stations limited the amount of\npetrol that could be dispensed, closed on Sundays, and restricted the days\nwhen petrol could be purchased, based on number plate numbers. Even after the\nembargo ended in March 1974, following intense diplomatic activity, prices\ncontinued to rise. The world experienced a global economic recession, with\nunemployment and inflation surging simultaneously, steep declines in stock and\nbond prices, major shifts in trade balances and petrodollar flows, and a\ndramatic end to the post-WWII economic boom.\n\nA woman uses wood in a fireplace for heat. A newspaper headline in the\nforeground shows a story regarding a lack of heating oil in the community.\n\nThe 1973\u20131974 oil embargo had lasting effects on the United States and other\nindustrialized nations, which established the International Energy Agency in\nresponse, as well as national emergency stockpiles designed to withstand\nmonths of future supply disruptions. Oil conservation efforts included lower\nspeed limits on highways, smaller and more energy-efficient cars and\nappliances, year-round daylight saving time, reduced usage of heating and air-\nconditioning, better building insulation, increased support of mass transit,\nand greater emphasis on coal, natural gas, ethanol, nuclear and other\nalternative energy sources. These long-term efforts became effective enough\nthat US oil consumption rose only 11 percent during 1980\u20132014, while real GDP\nrose 150 percent. But in the 1970s, OPEC nations demonstrated convincingly\nthat their oil could be used as both a political and economic weapon against\nother nations, at least in the short term.\n\nThe embargo also meant that a section of the Non-Aligned Movement saw power as\na source of hope for their developing countries. The Algerian president Houari\nBoum\u00e9di\u00e8ne expressed this hope in a speech at the UN's sixth Special Session,\nin April 1974:\n\n> The OPEC action is really the first illustration and at the same time the\n> most concrete and most spectacular illustration of the importance of raw\n> material prices for our countries, the vital need for the producing\n> countries to operate the levers of price control, and lastly, the great\n> possibilities of a union of raw material producing countries. This action\n> should be viewed by the developing countries as an example and a source of\n> hope."

Electric utilities worldwide switched from oil to coal, natural\ngas, or nuclear power; national governments initiated multibillion-dollar\nresearch programs to develop alternatives to oil; and commercial exploration\ndeveloped major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the\nGulf of Mexico. By 1986, daily worldwide demand for oil dropped by 5 million\nbarrels, non-OPEC production rose by an even-larger amount, and OPEC's market\nshare sank from approximately 50 percent in 1979 to less than 30 percent in\n1985. Illustrating the volatile multi-year timeframes of typical market cycles\nfor natural resources, the result was a six-year decline in the price of oil,\nwhich culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone. As one oil analyst\nsummarized succinctly: \"When the price of something as essential as oil\nspikes, humanity does two things: finds more of it and finds ways to use less\nof it.\"\n\nTo combat falling revenue from oil sales, in 1982 Saudi Arabia pressed OPEC\nfor audited national production quotas in an attempt to limit output and boost\nprices. When other OPEC nations failed to comply, Saudi Arabia first slashed\nits own production from 10 million barrels daily in 1979\u20131981 to just one-\nthird of that level in 1985. When even this proved ineffective, Saudi Arabia\nreversed course and flooded the market with cheap oil, causing prices to fall\nbelow US$10/bbl and higher-cost producers to become unprofitable.\n\nThese strategic measures by Saudi Arabia to regulate oil prices had profound\neconomic repercussions. As the swing producer in that period, the Kingdom\nfaced significant economic strain. Its revenues dramatically decreased from\n$119 billion in 1981 to $26 billion by 1985, leading to substantial budget\ndeficits and a doubling of its debt, reaching 100% of the Gross Domestic\nProduct.\n\nFaced with increasing economic hardship (which ultimately contributed to the\ncollapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989), the \"free-riding\" oil exporters that had\npreviously failed to comply with OPEC agreements finally began to limit\nproduction to shore up prices, based on painstakingly negotiated national\nquotas that sought to balance oil-related and economic criteria since 1986.\n(Within their sovereign-controlled territories, the national governments of\nOPEC members are able to impose production limits on both government-owned and\nprivate oil companies.) Generally when OPEC production targets are reduced,\noil prices increase."

Poorer members have pushed for\nproduction cuts from fellow members, to increase the price of oil and thus\ntheir own revenues. These proposals conflict with Saudi Arabia's stated long-\nterm strategy of being a partner with the world's economic powers to ensure a\nsteady flow of oil that would support economic expansion. Part of the basis\nfor this policy is the Saudi concern that overly expensive oil or unreliable\nsupply will drive industrial nations to conserve energy and develop\nalternative fuels, curtailing the worldwide demand for oil and eventually\nleaving unneeded barrels in the ground. To this point, Saudi Oil Minister\nYamani famously remarked in 1973: \"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out\nof stones.\" To elucidate Saudi Arabia's contemporary approach, in 2024, Saudi\nEnergy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman articulated a stance that reflects\nhow the kingdom has adapted to the evolving economic needs within OPEC and the\nbroader international community. Emphasizing the need for a balanced and fair\nglobal energy transition, he highlighted the importance of diversifying energy\nsources and noted significant investments in natural gas, petrochemicals, and\nrenewables. These efforts support economic development in emerging countries\nand align with global climate objectives. Additionally, he addressed shifting\nenergy security concerns, stating, \"Energy security in the 70s, 80s, and 90s\nwas more dependent on oil. Now, you get what happened last year... It was gas.\nThe future problem on energy security will not be oil. It will be renewables.\nAnd the materials, and the mines.\"\n\nOn 10 September 2008, with oil prices still near US$100/bbl, a production\ndispute occurred when the Saudis reportedly walked out of a negotiating\nsession where rival members voted to reduce OPEC output. Although Saudi\ndelegates officially endorsed the new quotas, they stated anonymously that\nthey would not observe them. _The New York Times_ quoted one such delegate as\nsaying: \"Saudi Arabia will meet the market's demand. We will see what the\nmarket requires and we will not leave a customer without oil. The policy has\nnot changed.\" Over the next few months, oil prices plummeted into the $30s,\nand did not return to $100 until the Libyan Civil War in 2011."

At the same time, US oil\nproduction nearly doubled from 2008 levels and approached the world-leading\n\"swing producer\" volumes of Saudi Arabia and Russia, due to the substantial\nlong-term improvement and spread of shale \"fracking\" technology in response to\nthe years of record oil prices. These developments led in turn to a plunge in\nUS oil import requirements (moving closer to energy independence), a record\nvolume of worldwide oil inventories, and a collapse in oil prices that\ncontinued into early 2016.\n\nIn spite of global oversupply, on 27 November 2014 in Vienna, Saudi oil\nminister Ali Al-Naimi blocked appeals from poorer OPEC members for production\ncuts to support prices. Naimi argued that the oil market should be left to\nrebalance itself competitively at lower price levels, strategically rebuilding\nOPEC's long-term market share by ending the profitability of high-cost US\nshale oil production. As he explained in an interview:\n\n> Is it reasonable for a highly efficient producer to reduce output, while the\n> producer of poor efficiency continues to produce? That is crooked logic. If\n> I reduce, what happens to my market share? The price will go up and the\n> Russians, the Brazilians, US shale oil producers will take my share... We\n> want to tell the world that high-efficiency producing countries are the ones\n> that deserve market share. That is the operative principle in all capitalist\n> countries... One thing is for sure: Current prices [roughly US$60/bbl] do\n> not support all producers.\n\nA year later, when OPEC met in Vienna on 4 December 2015, the organization had\nexceeded its production ceiling for 18 consecutive months, US oil production\nhad declined only slightly from its peak, world markets appeared to be\noversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day despite war-torn Libya\npumping 1 million barrels below capacity, oil producers were making major\nadjustments to withstand prices as low as $40, Indonesia was rejoining the\nexport organization, Iraqi production had surged after years of disorder,\nIranian output was poised to rebound with the lifting of international\nsanctions, hundreds of world leaders at the Paris Climate Agreement were\ncommitting to limit carbon emissions from fossil fuels, and solar technologies\nwere becoming steadily more competitive and prevalent. In light of all these\nmarket pressures, OPEC decided to set aside its ineffective production ceiling\nuntil the next ministerial conference in June 2016. By 20 January 2016, the\nOPEC Reference Basket was down to US$22.48/bbl \u2013 less than one-fourth of its\nhigh from June 2014 ($110.48), less than one-sixth of its record from July\n2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its\nhistoric run-up.\n\nAs 2016 continued, the oil glut was partially trimmed with significant\nproduction offline in the United States, Canada, Libya, Nigeria and China, and\nthe basket price gradually rose back into the $40s. OPEC regained a modest\npercentage of market share, saw the cancellation of many competing drilling\nprojects, maintained the status quo at its June conference, and endorsed\n\"prices at levels that are suitable for both producers and consumers\",\nalthough many producers were still experiencing serious economic difficulties."

Russia, which foresaw continuing cuts as\nAmerican shale oil production increased, rejected the demand, ending the\nthree-year partnership between OPEC and major non-OPEC providers. Another\nfactor was weakening global demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This\nalso resulted in 'OPEC plus' failing to extend the agreement cutting 2.1\nmillion barrels per day that was set to expire at the end of March. Saudi\nArabia, which has absorbed a disproportionate amount of the cuts to convince\nRussia to stay in the agreement, notified its buyers on 7 March that they\nwould raise output and discount their oil in April. This prompted a Brent\ncrude price crash of more than 30% before a slight recovery and widespread\nturmoil in financial markets.\n\nSeveral pundits saw this as a Saudi-Russian price war, or game of chicken\nwhich cause the \"other side to blink first\". Saudi Arabia had in March 2020\n$500 billion of foreign exchange reserves, while at that time Russia's\nreserves were $580 billion. The debt-to-GDP ratio of the Saudis was 25%, while\nthe Russian ratio was 15%. Another remarked that the Saudis can produce oil at\nas low a price as $3 per barrel, whereas Russia needs $30 per barrel to cover\nproduction costs. \"To Russia, this price war is more than just about regaining\nmarket share for oil,\" one analyst claims. \"It\u2019s about assaulting the Western\neconomy, especially America\u2019s.\" In order to ward off the oil exporters price\nwar which can make shale oil production uneconomical, US may protect its crude\noil market share by passing the NOPEC bill. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia,\nrepresented by Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, maintains a\nconciliatory stance towards the U.S. shale industry. He clarified that harming\nthis sector was never their intention, stating, \"I made it clear that it was\nnot on our radar or our intention to create any type of damage to their\nindustry... they will rise again from the ashes and thrive and prosper.\" He\nalso noted that Saudi Arabia is looking forward to a time when U.S. producers\nthrive once again in a market with higher oil demand.\"\n\nIn April 2020, OPEC and a group of other oil producers, including Russia,\nagreed to extend production cuts until the end of July. The cartel and its\nallies agreed to cut oil production in May and June by 9.7 million barrels a\nday, equal to around 10% of global output, in an effort to prop up prices,\nwhich had previously fallen to record lows."

In response, US President Joe Biden\nvowed \"consequences\" and said the US government would \"re-evaluate\" the\nlongstanding U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia.

Ecuador withdrew from\nOPEC in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2 million\nmembership fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed\nunder its OPEC quota at the time. Ecuador then rejoined in October 2007 before\nleaving again in January 2020. Ecuador's Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable\nNatural Resources released an official statement on 2 January 2020 which\nconfirmed that Ecuador had left OPEC. Similar concerns prompted Gabon to\nsuspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016.\n\nIn May 2008, Indonesia announced that it would leave OPEC when its membership\nexpired at the end of that year, having become a net importer of oil and being\nunable to meet its production quota. It rejoined the organization in January\n2016, but announced another \"temporary suspension\" of its membership at year-\nend when OPEC requested a 5% production cut.\n\nQatar left OPEC on 1 January 2019, after joining the organization in 1961, to\nfocus on natural gas production, of which it is the world's largest exporter\nin the form of liquified natural gas (LNG).\n\nIn an OPEC meeting in November 2023, Nigeria and Angola, the biggest oil\nproducers in Sub-Saharan Africa, expressed their discontent over OPEC's quotas\nwhich, according to them, blocked their efforts to ramp up oil production and\nboost their foreign reserves. In December 2023, Angola announced it was\nleaving the OPEC because it disagreed with the organization's production\nquotas scheme."

They launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in\n2005 was joined by IEF and renamed the Joint Organisations Data Initiative\n(JODI), covering more than 90% of the global oil market. GECF joined as an\neighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global\nmarket for natural gas.\n\nSince 2007, OPEC has published the \"World Oil Outlook\" (WOO) annually, in\nwhich it presents a comprehensive analysis of the global oil industry\nincluding medium- and long-term projections for supply and demand.

Benchmarks are\nused because oil prices differ (usually by a few dollars per barrel) based on\nvariety, grade, delivery date and location, and other legal requirements.\n\nThe OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes has been an important benchmark for oil\nprices since 2000. It is calculated as a weighted average of prices for\npetroleum blends from the OPEC member countries: Saharan Blend (Algeria),\nGirassol (Angola), Djeno (Republic of the Congo) Rabi Light (Gabon), Iran\nHeavy (Islamic Republic of Iran), Basra Light (Iraq), Kuwait Export (Kuwait),\nEs Sider (Libya), Bonny Light (Nigeria), Arab Light (Saudi Arabia), Murban\n(UAE), and Merey (Venezuela).\n\nNorth Sea Brent Crude Oil is the leading benchmark for Atlantic basin crude\noils and is used to price approximately two-thirds of the world's traded crude\noil.
