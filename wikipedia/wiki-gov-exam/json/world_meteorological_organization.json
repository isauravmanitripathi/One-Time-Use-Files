        "generated_section_content_md": "Specialized agency of the United Nations\n\nThe **World Meteorological Organization** (**WMO**) is a specialized agency of\nthe United Nations responsible for promoting international cooperation on\natmospheric science, climatology, hydrology and geophysics.\n\nThe WMO originated from the International Meteorological Organization (IMO), a\nnongovernmental organization founded in 1873 as a forum for exchanging weather\ndata and research. Proposals to reform the status and structure of the IMO\nculminated in the World Meteorological Convention of 1947, which formally\nestablished the World Meteorological Organization. The Convention entered into\nforce on 23 March 1950, and the following year the WMO began operations as an\nintergovernmental organization within the UN system.\n\nThe WMO is made up of 193 countries and territories, and facilitates the \"free\nand unrestricted\" exchange of data, information, and research between the\nrespective meteorological and hydrological institutions of its members. It\nalso collaborates with nongovernmental partners and other international\norganizations on matters related to environmental protection, climate change,\nresource management, and socioeconomic development.\n\nHeadquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, the WMO is governed by the World\nMeteorological Congress, composed of member states, which meets every four\nyears to set policies and priorities. The Congress is led by an Executive\nCouncil led by the President, currently Abdulla Al Mandous of UAE."

        "generated_section_content_md": "German meteorologist Gerhard Adrian, president of the World Meteorological\nOrganization, in 2019\n\nThe WMO was established by the Convention of the World Meteorological\nOrganization, signed 11 October 1947 and ratified on 23 March 1950. The\nConvention serves as the constituent treaty of the WMO, setting forth its\npurposes, governance, and general framework.\n\nThe WMO hierarchy:\n\n* The World Meteorological Congress, the supreme body of the Organization, determines policy. Each member state and territory is represented by a Permanent Representative with WMO when Congress meets every four years. Congress elects the President and vice-presidents of the Organization and members of the Executive Council; and appoints the Secretary-General.\n* The Executive Council (EC) implements Congress decisions.\n* The Secretariat is an eight-department organization with a staff of 200 headed by a Secretary-General, who can serve a maximum of two four-year terms.\n\nThe annually published WMO Statement on the status of the World Climate\nprovides details of global, regional and national temperatures and extreme\nweather events. It also provides information on long-term climate change\nindicators including atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, sea level\nrise, and sea ice extent. The year 2016 was the hottest year on record, with\nmany weather and climate extremes, according to the most recent WMO report.\n\nAs of August 2023, the WMO has a membership of 193 member states and\nterritories."
