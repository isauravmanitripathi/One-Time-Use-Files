It has 194 member states\nand 12 associate members, as well as partners in the non-governmental,\nintergovernmental and private sector. Headquartered in Paris, France, UNESCO\nhas 53 regional field offices and 199 national commissions.\n\nUNESCO was founded in 1945 as the successor to the League of Nations'\nInternational Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. UNESCO's founding\nmission, which was shaped by the events of World War II, is to advance peace,\nsustainable development and human rights by facilitating collaboration and\ndialogue among nations. It pursues this objective through five major programme\nareas: education, natural sciences, social/human sciences, culture and\ncommunication/information. UNESCO sponsors projects that improve literacy,\nprovide technical training and education, advance science, protect independent\nmedia and press freedom, preserve regional and cultural history, and promote\ncultural diversity. The organization prominently helps establish and secure\nWorld Heritage Sites of cultural and natural importance.\n\nUNESCO is governed by the General Conference composed of member states and\nassociate members, which meets biannually to set the agency's programs and\nbudget. It also elects members of the executive board, which manages UNESCO's\nwork, and appoints every four years a Director-General, who serves as UNESCO's\nchief administrator."

        "generated_section_content_md": "UNESCO and its mandate for international cooperation can be traced to a League\nof Nations resolution on 21 September 1921, to elect a commission to study the\nfeasibility of having nations freely share cultural, educational and\nscientific achievements. This new body, the International Committee on\nIntellectual Cooperation (ICIC), was created in 1922 and counted such figures\nas Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Robert A. Millikan, and\nGonzague de Reynold among its members (being thus a small commission of the\nLeague of Nations essentially centred on Western Europe). The International\nInstitute for Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC) was then created in Paris in\nSeptember 1924, to act as the executing agency for the ICIC. However, the\nonset of World War II largely interrupted the work of these predecessor\norganizations. As for private initiatives, the International Bureau of\nEducation (IBE) began to work as a non-governmental organization in the\nservice of international educational development since December 1925 and\njoined UNESCO in 1969, after having established a joint commission in 1952."

        "generated_section_content_md": "After the signing of the Atlantic Charter and the Declaration of the United\nNations, the Conference of Allied Ministers of Education (CAME) began meetings\nin London which continued from 16 November 1942 to 5 December 1945. On 30\nOctober 1943, the necessity for an international organization was expressed in\nthe Moscow Declaration, agreed upon by China, the United Kingdom, the United\nStates and the USSR. This was followed by the Dumbarton Oaks Conference\nproposals of 9 October 1944. Upon the proposal of CAME and in accordance with\nthe recommendations of the United Nations Conference on International\nOrganization (UNCIO), held in San Francisco from April to June 1945, a United\nNations Conference for the establishment of an educational and cultural\norganization (ECO/CONF) was convened in London from 1 to 16 November 1945 with\nforty-four governments represented. The idea of UNESCO was largely developed\nby Rab Butler, the Minister of Education for the United Kingdom, who had a\ngreat deal of influence in its development. At the ECO/CONF, the Constitution\nof UNESCO was introduced and signed by 37 countries, and a Preparatory\nCommission was established. The Preparatory Commission operated between 16\nNovember 1945, and 4 November 1946 \u2014 the date when UNESCO's Constitution came\ninto force with the deposit of the twentieth ratification by a member state.\n\nThe first General Conference took place from 19 November to 10 December 1946,\nand elected Julian Huxley to Director-General. United States Army colonel,\nuniversity president and civil rights advocate Blake R. Van Leer joined as a\nmember as well. The Constitution was amended in November 1954 when the General\nConference resolved that members of the executive board would be\nrepresentatives of the governments of the States of which they are nationals\nand would not, as before, act in their personal capacity. This change in\ngovernance distinguished UNESCO from its predecessor, the ICIC, in how member\nstates would work together in the organization's fields of competence. As\nmember states worked together over time to realize UNESCO's mandate, political\nand historical factors have shaped the organization's operations in particular\nduring the Cold War, the decolonization process, and the dissolution of the\nSoviet Union."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Among the major achievements of the organization is its work against racism,\nfor example through influential statements on race starting with a declaration\nof anthropologists (among them was Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss) and other scientists\nin 1950 and concluding with the 1978 Declaration on Race and Racial Prejudice.\n\nIn 1955, the Republic of South Africa withdrew from UNESCO saying that some of\nthe organization's publications amounted to \"interference\" in the country's\n\"racial problems\". It rejoined the organization in 1994 under the leadership\nof Nelson Mandela.\n\nOne of the early work of UNESCO in the education field was a pilot project on\nfundamental education in the Marbial Valley, Haiti, which was launched in\n1947. Following this project one of expert missions to other countries,\nincluded a 1949 mission to Afghanistan. UNESCO recommended in 1948 that Member\ncountries should make free primary education compulsory and universal. The\nWorld Conference on Education for All, in Jomtien, Thailand, started a global\nmovement in 1990 to provide basic education for all children, youths and\nadults. In 2000, World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, led member\ngovernments to commit for achieving basic education for all in 2015.\n\nThe World Declaration on Higher Education was adopted by UNESCO's World\nConference on Higher Education on 9 October 1998, with the aim of setting\nglobal standards on the ideals and accessibility of higher education.\n\nUNESCO's early activities in culture included the International Campaign to\nSave the Monuments of Nubia, launched in 1960. The purpose of the campaign was\nto move the Great Temple of Abu Simbel to keep it from being swamped by the\nNile after the construction of the Aswan Dam. During the 20-year campaign, 22\nmonuments and architectural complexes were relocated. This was the first and\nlargest in a series of campaigns including Mohenjo-daro (Pakistan), Fes\n(Morocco), Kathmandu (Nepal), Borobudur (Indonesia) and the Acropolis of\nAthens (Greece). The organization's work on heritage led to the adoption, in\n1972, of the Convention concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and\nNatural Heritage. In 1976, the World Heritage Committee was established and\nthe first sites were included on the World Heritage List in 1978. Since then\nimportant legal instruments on cultural heritage and diversity have been\nadopted by UNESCO member states in 2003 (Convention for the Safeguarding of\nthe Intangible Cultural Heritage) and 2005 (Convention on the Protection and\nPromotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions).\n\nAn intergovernmental meeting of UNESCO in Paris in December 1951 led to the\ncreation of the European Council for Nuclear Research, which was responsible\nfor establishing the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) later\non, in 1954.\n\nArid Zone programming, 1948\u20131966, is another example of an early major UNESCO\nproject in the field of natural sciences.\n\nIn 1968, UNESCO organized the first intergovernmental conference aimed at\nreconciling the environment and development, a problem that continues to be\naddressed in the field of sustainable development. The main outcome of the\n1968 conference was the creation of UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere Programme.\n\nUNESCO has been credited with the diffusion of national science bureaucracies.\n\nIn the field of communication, the \"free flow of ideas by word and image\" has\nbeen in UNESCO's constitution since it was established, following the\nexperience of the Second World War when control of information was a factor in\nindoctrinating populations for aggression. In the years immediately following\nWorld War II, efforts were concentrated on reconstruction and on the\nidentification of needs for means of mass communication around the world.\nUNESCO started organizing training and education for journalists in the 1950s.\nIn response to calls for a \"New World Information and Communication Order\" in\nthe late 1970s, UNESCO established the International Commission for the Study\nof Communication Problems, which produced the 1980 MacBride report (named\nafter the chair of the commission, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Se\u00e1n\nMacBride). The same year, UNESCO created the International Programme for the\nDevelopment of Communication (IPDC), a multilateral forum designed to promote\nmedia development in developing countries. In 1993, UNESCO's General\nConference endorsed the Windhoek Declaration on media independence and\npluralism, which led the UN General Assembly to declare the date of its\nadoption, 3 May, as World Press Freedom Day. Since 1997, UNESCO has awarded\nthe UNESCO / Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize every 3 May."

As\na result, the United States withdrew its funding, which had accounted for\nabout 22% of UNESCO's budget. Israel also reacted to Palestine's admittance to\nUNESCO by freezing Israeli payments to UNESCO and imposing sanctions on the\nPalestinian Authority, stating that Palestine's admittance would be\ndetrimental \"to potential peace talks\".\n\nIn 2013, two years after stopping payment of its dues to UNESCO, the United\nStates and Israel lost UNESCO voting rights, but without losing the right to\nbe elected; thus, the United States was elected as a member of the executive\nboard for the period from 2016 to 2019. In 2019, Israel left UNESCO after 69\nyears of membership, with Israel's ambassador to the UN Danny Danon writing:\n\"UNESCO is the body that continually rewrites history, including by erasing\nthe Jewish connection to Jerusalem... it is corrupted and manipulated by\nIsrael's enemies... we are not going to be a member of an organization that\ndeliberately acts against us.\"\n\nAlso in 2023, the United States stated its intent to rejoin UNESCO, five years\nafter leaving, and to pay its US$600 million of back dues. The United States\nwas readmitted by the UNESCO General Conference that July. Three years later,\nin 2025, however, the United States stated its intent to withdraw again, to be\neffective as of December 2026."

In 2010, Israel designated the Cave of\nthe Patriarchs in Hebron and Rachel's Tomb in Bethlehem \u2013 both in the West\nBank \u2013 as National Heritage Sites and announced restoration work, prompting\ncriticism from the Obama administration and protests from Palestinians. In\nOctober 2010, UNESCO's executive board voted to declare the sites as \"al-Haram\nal-Ibrahimi/Tomb of the Patriarchs\" and \"Bilal bin Rabah Mosque/Rachel's Tomb\"\nand stated that they were \"an integral part of the occupied Palestinian\nTerritories\" and any unilateral Israeli action was a violation of\ninternational law. UNESCO described the sites as significant to \"people of the\nMuslim, Christian and Jewish traditions\", and accused Israel of highlighting\nonly the Jewish character of the sites. Israel in turn accused UNESCO of\n\"detach[ing] the Nation of Israel from its heritage\", and accused it of being\npolitically motivated. The Rabbi of the Western Wall said that Rachel's tomb\nhad not previously been declared a holy Muslim site. Israel partially\nsuspended ties with UNESCO. Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon\ndeclared that the resolution was a \"part of Palestinian escalation\". Zevulun\nOrlev, chairman of the Knesset Education and Culture Committee, referred to\nthe resolutions as an attempt to undermine the mission of UNESCO as a\nscientific and cultural organization that promotes cooperation throughout the\nworld.\n\nOn 28 June 2011, UNESCO's World Heritage Committee, at Jordan's insistence,\ncensured[_clarification needed_] Israel's decision to demolish and rebuild the\nMughrabi Gate Bridge in Jerusalem for safety reasons. Israel stated that\nJordan had signed an agreement with Israel stipulating that the existing\nbridge must be dismantled for safety reasons; Jordan disputed the agreement,\nsaying that it was only signed under U.S. pressure. Israel was also unable to\naddress the UNESCO committee over objections from Egypt.\n\nIn January 2014, days before it was scheduled to open, UNESCO Director-\nGeneral, Irina Bokova, \"indefinitely postponed\" and effectively cancelled an\nexhibit created by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre entitled \"The People, The Book,\nThe Land: The 3,500-year relationship between the Jewish people and the Land\nof Israel\". The event was scheduled to run from 21 January through 30 January\nin Paris. Bokova cancelled the event after representatives of Arab states at\nUNESCO argued that its display would \"harm the peace process\". The author of\nthe exhibition, professor Robert Wistrich of the Hebrew University's Vidal\nSassoon International Centre for the Study of Anti-Semitism, called the\ncancellation an \"appalling act\", and characterized Bokova's decision as \"an\narbitrary act of total cynicism and, really, contempt for the Jewish people\nand its history\". UNESCO amended the decision to cancel the exhibit within the\nyear, and it quickly achieved popularity and was viewed as a great success.\n\nOn 1 January 2019, Israel formally left UNESCO in pursuance of the US\nwithdrawal over perceived continuous anti-Israel bias."

Palestinian\nleaders welcomed the decision. While the text acknowledged the \"importance of\nthe Old City of Jerusalem and its walls for the three monotheistic religions\",\nit referred to the sacred hilltop compound in Jerusalem's Old City only by its\nMuslim name \"Al-Haram al-Sharif\", Arabic for Noble Sanctuary. In response,\nIsrael denounced the UNESCO resolution for its omission of the words \"Temple\nMount\" or \"Har HaBayit\", stating that it denies Jewish ties to the key holy\nsite. After receiving criticism from numerous Israeli politicians and\ndiplomats, including Benjamin Netanyahu and Ayelet Shaked, Israel froze all\nties with the organization. The resolution was condemned by Ban Ki-moon and\nthe Director-General of UNESCO, Irina Bokova, who said that Judaism, Islam and\nChristianity have clear historical connections to Jerusalem and \"to deny,\nconceal or erase any of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim traditions undermines\nthe integrity of the site. \"Al-Aqsa Mosque [or] Al-Haram al-Sharif\" is also\nTemple Mount, whose Western Wall is the holiest place in Judaism.\" It was also\nrejected by the Czech Parliament which said the resolution reflects a \"hateful\nanti-Israel sentiment\", and hundreds of Italian Jews demonstrated in Rome over\nItaly's abstention. On 26 October, UNESCO approved a reviewed version of the\nresolution, which also criticized Israel for its continuous \"refusal to let\nthe body's experts access Jerusalem's holy sites to determine their\nconservation status\". Despite containing some softening of language following\nIsraeli protests over a previous version, Israel continued to denounce the\ntext. The resolution refers to the site Jews and Christians refer to as the\nTemple Mount, or Har HaBayit in Hebrew, only by its Arab name \u2013 a significant\nsemantic decision also adopted by UNESCO's executive board, triggering\ncondemnation from Israel and its allies. U.S. Ambassador Crystal Nix Hines\nstated: \"This item should have been defeated. These politicized and one-sided\nresolutions are damaging the credibility of UNESCO.\"\n\nIn October 2017, the United States and Israel announced they would withdraw\nfrom the organization, citing in-part anti-Israel bias."

It was\n> nuts to get out, and would be nuttier not to rejoin.\n\nLeach concluded that the record showed Israel bashing, a call for a new world\ninformation order, money management, and arms control policy to be the\nimpetuses behind the withdrawal; he asserted that before departing from\nUNESCO, a withdrawal from the IAEA had been pushed on him. On 1 October 2003,\nthe United States rejoined UNESCO.\n\nOn 12 October 2017, the United States notified UNESCO it would again withdraw\nfrom the organization, on 31 December 2018; Israel followed suit. The\nDepartment of State cited \"mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for\nfundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at\nUNESCO\".\n\nThe United States has not paid over $600 million in dues since it stopped\npaying its $80 million annual UNESCO dues when Palestine became a full member\nin 2011. Israel and the United States were among the 14 votes against the\nmembership out of 194 member countries. When the United States announced it\nwas rejoining the body in 2023, it also pledged to pay all past-due payments.\n\nOn 4 February 2025, the White House said to conduct a review of US membership\nin UNESCO.

An expert cited by UNESCO as\nattributing the 10 billion figure denied it, saying he had \"no idea\" where the\nfigure came from. Art dealers were particularly critical of the UNESCO figure\nbecause it amounted to 15% of the total world art market.\n\nIn November 2020, part of a UNESCO advertising campaign intended to highlight\ninternational trafficking in looted artefacts had to be withdrawn after it\nfalsely presented a series of museum-held artworks with known provenances as\nrecently looted objects held in private collections. The adverts claimed that\na head of Buddha in the Metropolitan Museum's collection since 1930 had been\nlooted from a Kabul Museum in 2001 and then smuggled into the US art market,\nthat a funerary monument from Palmyra that the Met had acquired in 1901 had\nbeen recently looted from the Palmyra Museum by Islamic State militants and\nthen smuggled into the European antiquities market, and that an Ivory Coast\nmask with a provenance that indicates it was in the United States by 1954 was\nlooted during armed clashes in 2010\u20132011.
