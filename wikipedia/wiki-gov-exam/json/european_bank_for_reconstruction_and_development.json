As a multilateral developmental investment bank, the EBRD\nuses investment as a tool to build market economies.\n\nInitially focused on the countries of the former Eastern Bloc it expanded to\nsupport development in more than 30 countries from Central Europe to Central\nAsia. Similar to other multilateral development banks, the EBRD has members\nfrom all over the world (North America, Africa, Asia and Australia, see\nbelow), with the biggest single shareholder being the United States, but only\nlends regionally in its countries of operations. Headquartered in London, the\nEBRD is owned by 75 countries and two European Union institutions, the newest\nshareholder being Nigeria since February 2025. Despite its public sector\nshareholders, it invests in private enterprises, together with commercial\npartners.\n\nThe EBRD is not to be confused with the European Investment Bank (EIB), which\nis owned by EU member states and is used to support EU policy. EBRD is also\ndistinct from the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB)."

        "generated_section_content_md": "175 Bishopsgate in London, the EBRD's head office between 1992 and 2022\n\nLocated in London, the EBRD was intended at its beginning to focus on the\nswitch from centrally planned economy to market based economy in the Central\nand Eastern European countries by investing in the private sector, mainly\nbanks, industries and businesses, and by promoting policies that would favor\nthem. It was created as a result of the end of the Cold War because of\nparticular issues regarding the international system in place, the historical\nand political context at the time. Furthermore, its recipient countries had to\nensure that they would work towards \"multi-party democracy and political\npluralism\" in which was considered as one of the main particularity of the\nEBRD distinguishing the latter from other financial institutions. Firstly,\nnotably advocated by European political actors such as the French President\nMitterrand in 1989, the idea of creating this financial institution involving\nthe European countries started before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The\nreception of this proposition was mitigated depending on the country, for\ninstance it received hostility from the British whereas the French were\nimportant proponents of the project and influenced the process. In January\n1990, negotiations about the EBRD objectives, its lending policy regarding the\npublic and private sectors, started and involved all the EU countries at the\ntime, as well as various other European countries, non-European countries and\nrepresentatives from the EU and the European Investment Bank. The Soviet Union\nwas represented by its own delegation in the process and thus participated in\nthe negotiations as well as the USA. Later on, because of dissensions on the\npolitical and economic objectives of the institution, the inclusion of the\nSoviet Union was threatened. Considered as short negotiations, the agreement\n(for reasons relating to the situation in Eastern Europe and to a wave of\nprivatization across Europe) leading to its creation was signed on 29 May 1990\nby actors such as 40 states as well as two European organizations and by March\n1991 took its first effects as the bank was inaugurated. The creation of the\nEBRD has led to the financing of various projects in the years following its\nfirst operations, for instance there were twenty projects in 1992 in which the\nEBRD provided financing worth ECU 2.1 billion."

In fact, in the beginning of the 90s, there were two\ndifferent banking divisions (on one side, the merchant banking related to the\nprivate sector and on the other side the development banking side working\nmostly with the public sector). Consequently, the two divisions came to be\nmerged into a single one, substituting this structure with another one instead\ndividing the bank with seven policy and country regional sub-divisions."

Furthermore, this\nuneven concentration is notably visible in the countries benefiting from the\nEBRD activities. This has led to a reflection over the idea of winners and\nlosers regarding globalisation.\n\nIn contrast to the highlighted inclusion objective, concerns regarding\ninclusion, which notably involves gender equality, have been rather absent\nfrom the bank's attributions until recently. For instance, a Strategic Gender\nInitiative was validated by the EBRD President in 2013 as well as various\nprojects involving gender equality related objectives.\n\nNGOs have criticised the EBRD on the lack of progress the EBRD makes in its\nmain mission, the \u201ctransition towards open and democratic market economies.\u201d"

The Standing Committee of the\nBern Convention requested immediate suspension of the project, with reference\nto the high biodiversity of the area and its importance as a core reproductive\narea for the Balkan lynx, one of the most endangered mammals on the planet. In\nJanuary 2017, the bank cancelled the loan saying the \"conditions for\ndisbursement were not met.\"\n\nAgain in North Macedonia, the EBRD was criticised by environmentalists after\nplans were announced to bisect National Park Gali\u010dica in the UNESCO Ohrid-\nPrespa Transboundary Biosphere Reserve with an A3 express road, which would\nhave required certain zones of protection in the national park to be\ndowngraded. Scientists from North Macedonia and across the world signed a\ndeclaration in opposition to this and other projects proposed for the Ohrid-\nPrespa region, a message that was reinforced by a Joint Reactive Monitoring\nMission from the World Heritage Centre, ICOMOS and the IUCN, which requested\ntotal cancellation of proposed A3 road sections. This recommendation was\nunderlined by the World Heritage Committee at its 41st session in Krak\u00f3w.\nEventually, in February 2018, the Republic of North Macedonia abandoned plans\nfor the road, redirecting the EBRD's funds to other infrastructure projects."
