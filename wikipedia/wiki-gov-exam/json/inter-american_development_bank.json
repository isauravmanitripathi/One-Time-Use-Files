It serves as one of the leading sources of development\nfinancing for the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Established in\n1959, the IDB supports Latin American and Caribbean economic, social, and\ninstitutional development and regional integration by lending to governments\nand sub-national agencies, developing new financial tools, creating enabling\nconditions for private-sector-led growth, convening and aligning countries\naround common interests, and bridging the region with the rest of the world.\n\nThe IDB also provides extensive technical assistance to its borrowing member\ncountries. It works across a range of sectors, including infrastructure,\nhealth, education, energy, citizen security, environmental sustainability,\ntrade, transportation, housing, and small businesses.\n\nIt works in conjunction with IDB Invest, which pursues development by\nsupporting the region's private sector through lending, mobilization, and\nadvisory services. IDB Lab is the Bank's entrepreneurial innovation and\nventure-capital arm."

        "generated_section_content_md": "At the First Pan-American Conference in 1890, the idea of a development\ninstitution for Latin America was first suggested during the earliest efforts\nto create an inter-American system. The IDB became a reality under an\ninitiative proposed by President Juscelino Kubitschek of Brazil. The Bank was\nformally created on April 8, 1959, when the Organization of American States\ndrafted the Articles of Agreement establishing the Inter-American Development\nBank."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The IDB is governed by its Board of Governors, composed of representatives of\nthe Bank's 48 member countries. The Governors are usually finance ministers or\nother senior economic officials. The Board gathers at an Annual Meeting in\nMarch or April to review the Bank\u2019s operations and make major policy\ndecisions.\n\nThe developing countries that borrow from the IDB are the majority\nshareholders, and therefore control the majority of the decision-making bodies\nof the Bank. Each member's voting power is determined by its shareholding: its\nsubscription to the Bank's ordinary capital. The United States holds 30\npercent of the Bank's shares, while the countries of Latin America and the\nCaribbean combined hold 50.02 percent, with another 20% held by member\ncountries in Europe and Asia. This arrangement is unique in that the\ndeveloping member countries, as a group, are the majority shareholders. Though\nthis arrangement was first viewed as risky, it is believed by some that strict\npeer pressure prevents the borrowers from defaulting, even when under severe\neconomic pressure."

This arrangement ensures that the IDB\nmaintains a triple-A credit rating, and as a result can make loans to its\nborrowing member countries at rates of interest similar to those that\ncommercial banks charge their largest corporate borrowers. At the same time,\nthe 22 non-borrowing countries are only putting up guarantees \u2013 not actual\nfunds \u2013 so their support of the IDB's lending operations has a minimal impact\non their national budgets.\n\nThe funds that the IDB lends are raised by selling bonds to institutional\ninvestors at standard commercial rates of interest. The bonds are backed by\n(a) the sum of the capital subscriptions actually paid in by the Bank's 48\nmember countries, plus (b) the sum of the callable capital subscriptions\npledged by the Bank's 22 non-borrowing member countries. Together these\nconstitute the Bank's _ordinary capital_ , some $101 billion. Of this amount,\n4.3 percent is paid in, while the remaining 95.7 percent is callable.\n\nAccording to the IDB's 2023 Annual Report, the Bank approved 92 sovereign-\nguaranteed loan projects for $12.7 billion in total financing that year.\nAccording to IDB Invest, it had a \"record year\" in 2023, with total activity\nsurpassing $10 billion, including $5.3 billion in mobilized resources from\nprivate investors. In 2025, IDB President Ilan Goldfajn announced the\nintention to increase financing capacity by an additional $130 billion over a\ndecade.\n\nAccording to the IDB's own measurements for 2024, 76% of IDB loan approvals,\n94% of IDB Invest commitments and 96% of IDB Lab approvals supported\nsustainable economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean."

Hence, empowering institutions, such as, the World Bank, IFC,\nthe IDB, and others can exercise their due diligence to fit those promising\nentities in their projects with eased regulatory restraints, as certain\nregulations that work in developed nations are obstacles to progress in\ndeveloping nations.[_citation needed_]"
