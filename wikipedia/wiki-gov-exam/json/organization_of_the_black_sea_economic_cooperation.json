It traces its origin to 25 June 1992, when\nTurkish President Turgut \u00d6zal and leaders of ten other countries gathered in\nIstanbul and signed the Summit Declaration and the \"Bosphorus Statement\". BSEC\nHeadquarters \u2013 the Permanent International Secretariat of the Organization of\nthe Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC PERMIS) \u2013 was established in March\n1994, also in Istanbul.\n\nWith the entry into force of its Charter on 1 May 1999, BSEC acquired\ninternational legal identity and was transformed into a full-fledged regional\neconomic organization: **Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation**.\nWith the accession of Serbia (then Serbia and Montenegro) in April 2004, the\nOrganization\u2019s Member States increased to twelve. North Macedonia's accession\nin 2020 increased the organization's membership to thirteen.\n\nAn important aspect of the activities of BSEC is the development of SME and\nentrepreneurship in the member countries. Concerning these issues, a series of\nworkshops have been organized in cooperation with Konrad Adenauer Foundation\nand ERENET."
