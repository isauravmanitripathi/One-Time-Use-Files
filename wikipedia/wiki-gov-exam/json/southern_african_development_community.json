        "generated_section_content_md": "The origins of SADC are in the 1960s and 1970s, when the leaders of majority-\nruled countries and national liberation movements coordinated their political,\ndiplomatic and military struggles to bring an end to colonial and white-\nminority rule in southern Africa.[_citation needed_] The immediate forerunner\nof the political and security cooperation leg of today's SADC was the informal\nFrontline States (FLS) grouping. It was formed in 1980.[_citation needed_]\n\nFlag of the SADCC (1980-1992)\n\nThe Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) was the\nforerunner of the socio-economic cooperation leg of today's SADC. The adoption\nby nine majority-ruled southern African countries of the Lusaka declaration on\n1 April 1980 paved the way for the formal establishment of SADCC in April\n1980.[_citation needed_]\n\nMembership of the FLS and SADCC sometimes differed.[_citation needed_]\n\nSADCC was transformed into SADC on 17 August 1992, with the adoption by the\nfounding members of SADCC and newly independent Namibia of the Windhoek\ndeclaration and treaty establishing SADC. The 1992 SADC provided for both\nsocio-economic cooperation and political and security cooperation. In reality,\nthe FLS was dissolved only in 1994, after South Africa's first democratic\nelections. Subsequent efforts to place political and security cooperation on a\nfirm institutional footing under SADC's umbrella failed.[_citation needed_]\n\nOn 14 August 2001, the 1992 SADC treaty was amended. The amendment heralded\nthe overhaul of the structures, policies and procedures of SADC, a process\nwhich is ongoing. One of the changes is that political and security\ncooperation is institutionalised in the Organ on Politics, Defence and\nSecurity (OPDS); one of the principal SADC bodies. It is subject to the\noversight of the organisation's supreme body, the Summit, which comprises the\nheads of state or government.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe organisation holds its own multi-sport event in the form of the SADC\nGames, which was first held in 2004 in Maputo. Originally planned for an\nearlier date in Malawi and Lesotho, organisational issues led to abandonment\nof the plan and the SADC issuing a fine of $100,000 against Malawi. The first\nevent in 2004 in Maputo resulted in over 1000 youths under-20 from 10\ncountries taking part in a sports programme including athletics, football,\nnetball, boxing and basketball.\n\nIn 2012, the SADC deployed peacekeepers to the Democratic Republic of Congo in\norder to counter a rebel threat. The deployed troops were supplied by\nTanzania, Malawi, and South Africa.\n\nIn August 2019 SADC adopted Swahili as its fourth working language, alongside\nEnglish, French and Portuguese. Kiswahili \u2013 a lingua franca in the African\nGreat Lakes region, other parts of East Africa, and to a lesser degree, parts\nof Southern Africa \u2013 is an official language of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda and\nof the African Union."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The SADC Free Trade Area was established in August 2008, after the\nimplementation of the SADC Protocol on Trade in 2000 laid the foundation for\nits formation. Its original members were Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar,\nMauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia and\nZimbabwe, with Malawi and Seychelles joining later. Of the 15 SADC member\nstates, only Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo are not yet\nparticipating, however Angolan trade minister Joffre Van-D\u00fanen J\u00fanior said in\nLuanda that his ministry is working to create conditions for Angola's\naccession to the SADC Free Trade Area in 2019. The SADC-Customs Union,\nscheduled to be established by 2010 according to SADC's Regional Indicative\nStrategic Development Plan (RISDP), is unlikely to become reality in the near\nfuture. This is because the European Union's Economic Partnership Agreements\n(EPA) with their inherent extra-regional freetrade regimes provided for\nseveral SADC members more benefits than deeper regional market integration\nwithin the framework of a SADC-Customs Union. Since these SADC countries\nformed four different groupings to negotiate and implement different Economic\nPartnership Agreements with the European Union, the chance to establish a\nSADC-wide common external tariff as prerequisite for a regional customs union\nis missed.\n\nOn Wednesday 22 October 2008, SADC joined with the Common Market for Eastern\nand Southern Africa and the East African Community to form the African Free\nTrade Zone, including all members of each of the organizations. The leaders of\nthe three trading blocs agreed to create a single free trade zone, the African\nFree Trade Zone, consisting of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated $624bn\n(\u00a3382.9bn). It is hoped the African Free Trade Zone agreement would ease\naccess to markets within the zone and end problems arising from the fact that\nseveral of the member countries belong to multiple groups.\n\nThe African Free Trade Zone effective has been more than a hundred years in\nthe making\u2014a trade zone spanning the whole African continent from Cape to\nCairo and envisioned by Cecil Rhodes and other British imperialists in the\n1890s. The only difference is that the African Free Trade Zone is the creation\nof independent African Countries. The idea is a free trade zone spanning the\nwhole continent from the Cape to Cairo (Cape Town in the Republic of South\nAfrica to Cairo in Egypt).\n\nIn addition to eliminating duplicative membership and the problem member\nstates also participating in other regional economic cooperation schemes and\nregional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or\nundermine each other, the African Free Trade Zone further aims to strengthen\nthe bloc's bargaining power when negotiating international deals.\n\nPursuant to the SADC goal of more integration, Botswana and Namibia signed an\nagreement in February 2023 allowing citizens to travel between the two\ncountries using only identity cards, with passports no longer being needed.\nBotswana has held talks with Zimbabwe to achieve a similar deal, and expects\nto open talks with Zambia."

Some of these\nchallenges cannot be tackled effectively by individual members. Cattle\ndiseases and organised-crime gangs know no boundaries. War in one country can\nsuck in its neighbours and damage their economies. The sustainable development\nthat trade could bring is threatened by the existence of different product\nstandards and tariff regimes, weak customs infrastructure and bad roads. The\nsocio-economic and political and security cooperation aims of SADC are equally\nwide-ranging, and intended to address the various common challenges.\n\nOne significant challenge is that member states also participate in other\nregional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security\ncooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine SADC's aims. For\nexample, South Africa and Botswana both belong to the Southern Africa Customs\nUnion, Zambia is a part of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa,\nand Tanzania is a member of the East African Community.\n\nAccording to Human Rights Watch, \"SADC has been criticized for its laxity on\nmaking human rights compliance within its member states a priority\"."
