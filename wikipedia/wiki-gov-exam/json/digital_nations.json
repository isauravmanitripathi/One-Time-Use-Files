Discussion points involving this theme\nincluded looking at whether simply changing the curriculum is enough to\nachieve this goal, methods that may be used to give teachers the skills to\nteach and inspire children to code, connecting the fields of industry and\neducation so that such a change can be achieved, and ensuring gender balance\nand encouraging girls to take on tech roles.\n\nAdvances made by the D5's participating countries have already been made to\nachieve this goal. In the UK, England became the first country in the world to\nmandate that coding be taught to all pupils aged 5 to 16; In Estonia, primary\nschools have been teaching students to code since the 1990s; In New Zealand,\nthey have introduced a set of Digital Technology Guidelines that will allow\nsecondary schools to teach the subject coherently \u2013 they have also invested in\nnew graduate ICT training schools to transition tertiary students into the\nworkforce; in Israel they have \"the most rigorous computer science high school\nprogramme in the world\" due to a major review of computing at school that took\nplace in the 1990s; South Korea teaches some computer science in school and\nalso offers an optional online course for those who are interested."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The focus of open markets is to open bidding on government IT contracts to\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through the use of digital\nmarketplaces such as the UK Government's G-cloud. The benefit of this to the\ngovernment is to reduce costs by contracting out to the company that can\nprovide the best value for money spent. The reduced barriers provided by an\nopen market give SMEs who may not have been previously considered for a\ngovernment contract, or who have never bid on one before, a fairer and more\nseamless opportunity to do so. Moving away from large outsourcers requires\nright sizing, which in this case can be achieved by buying parts of contracts\nfrom several smaller suppliers rather than buying one large contract from a\nsingle supplier, using agile delivery, buying cloud services, and building in-\nhouse engineering and operations capability.\n\nLike the UK's G-cloud, New Zealand is also building a government cloud\nprogramme to ease the process of government buying from SMEs. They are\ncommitted to using 'as a service' products to open up the market. South Korea\ntoo has already built an e-procurement system that allows SMEs the opportunity\nto win government contracts. Since its inception, it has saved $8 billion\nannually and made a reduction of 7.8 million pages of paper documents per\nyear. Bidding time has been reduced from thirty hours to two."

Citing a Cisco figure,\nthe D5 expects over 50 billion internet connected devices to be in use around\nthe world by 2020, with as many as dozens of each device in every household.\n\nTo meet these needs, the UK government's focus will be on Machine to Machine\ntechnology, the Internet of Things and 5G mobile networks. In March 2014, they\nannounced they will be investing \u00a345 million in the Internet of Things. They\nhave set up smart cities demonstrators in Glasgow, London, Bristol and\nPeterborough, and their 5G Innovation Centre is the world's first dedicated 5G\ntestbed centre. In a speech during the summit, Cabinet Minister Francis Maude\nannounced that the UK intends to have 97% of all citizen interactions with the\nstate online by the end of the next parliament. In Estonia they have X-Road, a\nsecure platform-independent Internet-based data exchange layer that provides\ntransparent digital services with minimum costs. Through a public-private\npartnership, New Zealand is in the process of upgrading internet\ninfrastructure to fibre-optic cables. Korea too has made a significant\ninvestment into The Internet of Things."
