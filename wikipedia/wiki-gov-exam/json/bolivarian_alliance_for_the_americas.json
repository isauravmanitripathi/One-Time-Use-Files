Venezuela began to deliver\nabout 96,000 barrels of oil per day from its state-owned oil company, PDVSA,\nto Cuba at very favorable prices. In exchange, Cuba sent 20,000 state-employed\nmedical staff and thousands of teachers to Venezuela's poorest states. The\nagreement also made it possible for Venezuelans to travel to Cuba for\nspecialized medical care, free of charge.[_self-published source?_]\n\nWhen it was launched in 2004, ALBA had only two member states, Venezuela and\nCuba. Subsequently, a number of other Latin American and Caribbean nations\nentered into this 'Peoples' Trade Agreement' (Spanish: _Tratado de Comercio de\nlos Pueblos_ , or TCP), which aims to implement the principles of ALBA.\nBolivia under Evo Morales joined in 2006, Nicaragua under Daniel Ortega in\n2007, and Ecuador under Rafael Correa in 2009. Honduras, under Manuel Zelaya,\njoined in 2008, but withdrew in 2010 after the 2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat. The\nCaribbean nations Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Saint Vincent and the\nGrenadines and Saint Lucia also joined.\n\nJamaica, at the invitation of Ch\u00e1vez, and Mexico, at the invitation of Ortega,\nwere invited to join the ALBA countries. Ch\u00e1vez also invited the countries of\nCentral America to join ALBA, and invited Argentina to use SUCRE. In the 11th\nSummit of ALBA in February 2012, Suriname, Saint Lucia and Haiti requested\nadmission to the organization. Haiti was granted the special status of\npermanent member and the other two countries were named special members, while\nawaiting their full incorporation.\n\nIn July 2013, Ch\u00e1vez was honored posthumously by the nine member countries of\nthe group and special guests Uruguay, Argentina, Brazil, Suriname, Guyana and\nHaiti at the group's 12th Presidential Summit in Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n\nIn December 2014, Grenada and Saint Kitts and Nevis were accepted as full\nmembers during the 13th Summit of the Alliance, which occurred in Havana,\nCuba.\n\nEcuador withdrew from ALBA in August 2018. Bolivia's interim government\nwithdrew in November 2019 during the political crisis, but the newly elected\ngovernment of Luis Arce rejoined following the 2020 Bolivian general election.\n\nAmid the international isolation Russia is facing due to the invasion of\nUkraine, ALBA invited Russia to participate at the 2023 ALBA Games."
