In 2003, GUAM\nbecame an observer in the UN General Assembly. In 2007, GUAM also established\na military peacekeeping force and organized joint military exercises. Such\nincreasingly deepened integration and relationships led to GUAM playing an\nimportant role in the region's diplomatic and commercial affairs.\n\nThe agreement on a Free Trade Area was signed in 2002. In 2017, additional\nagreements on a free-trade area were announced, but as of 2022 reportedly the\nFTA has not been ratified and has not entered into force. The WTO was notified\nonly in 2017 and the Agreement is designated as \"Plurilateral\" and \"In Force\".\nAccording to the WTO database, the GUAM FTA agreement was signed in 2002 and\nentered into force in 2003. International Trade Centre says there is no free\ntrade area in operation with distinct rules from an Agreement on Creation of\nCIS Free Trade Area, was signed on 15 April 1994 by 12 CIS countries.\n\nThe database of agreements of the International Trade Centre does not indicate\nthat a GUAM FTA agreement has been concluded, but it does indicate that the\n1994 Agreement on CIS FTA is in force for Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and\nMoldova. and the 1999 Agreement on CIS FTA version is listed as the current\ntext of the FTA agreement.\n\nThe official negotiating language of GUAM was Russian, but it was scrapped in\nfavor of English in 2014.\n\nElection monitoring by GUAM has been described as \"low-quality\", as observers\nfrom the group validate flawed elections."

In 1999, the\norganisation adopted the name **GUUAM** due to the membership of Uzbekistan. A\nsummit in Yalta on 6 and 7 June 2001 was accompanied by the signing of GUUAM's\ncharter, which formalized the organization. According to the former Ukrainian\nPresident Viktor Yushchenko, the charter set objectives for cooperation, such\nas promoting democratic values, ensuring stable development, enhancing\ninternational and regional security, and stepping up European integration.\n\nIn 2002, Uzbekistan announced that it planned to withdraw from the\norganization and following this announcement started to ignore GUUAM summits\nand meetings. In May 2005, shortly after the Andijan massacre, Uzbekistan\nfinally gave official notice of withdrawal from the organization to the\nMoldovan presidency, thus changing the group's name back to GUAM.\n\nA summit of GUUAM took place in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Moldova, on 22 April 2005. The US\nDepartment of State special representative for Eurasian conflicts, Steven\nMann, and the OSCE Secretary General, J\u00e1n Kubi\u0161, participated in the summit.\nThe Russian ambassador in Chi\u0219in\u0103u criticized the fact that Russia was not\ninvited to attend. Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, said after the\nsummit: \"Our organization is emerging as a powerful force, participating in\nresolving problems in the Caspian\u2014Black Sea region\" while the president of\nUkraine, Viktor Yushchenko, said that a new page had been written in the\nhistory of the organization."

However, GUAM leaders repeatedly and\nofficially dismiss such claims and declare their strong willingness to develop\nclose friendly relations with Russia.[_citation needed_] Moreover, Azerbaijan,\nthe group's main energy power, has managed to avoid any conflicts with Russia\nin recent years.\n\nIn April 2006, three GUAM nations supported Ukraine's proposal to condemn the\nHolodomor, the 1930s famine in Ukraine which killed millions of people, as a\ngenocide.\n\nIn May 2006, Ukraine and Azerbaijan announced plans to further increase the\nGUAM member relations by renaming the organization _GUAM Organization for\nDemocracy and Economic Development_ and establishing its headquarters in the\nUkrainian capital. The other members said this was a remarkable step and\ndevelopment. The summit participants were also expected to adopt GUAM by\u2014laws,\na declaration and a communique. Also in May 2006 the Ukrainian Defense\nMinistry announced plans to establish GUAM peacekeeping forces. The following\nyear, GUAM nations agreed to form a 500-personnel joint peacekeeping force to\nbattle separatism.\n\nIn June 2007, presidents of Lithuania, Poland and Romania joined the leaders\nof GUAM member states at the GUAM summit in Baku, Azerbaijan. Also\nparticipating at the summit were the Vice-President of Bulgaria, the Vice-\nSpeaker of the Estonian parliament, the Minister of Economy of Latvia, and the\nhigh\u2014level representatives of the United States, Japan, the Organization for\nSecurity and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the Organization of the Black Sea\nEconomic Cooperation (BSEC), UNESCO, and heads of diplomatic missions\naccredited in Azerbaijan."

It\nis too soon to be sure whether GUAM member states will ratify the free trade\narea soon, or if the project will be placed on hiatus. There is also the\nquestion about to what extent an FTA could help financially GUAM countries\ncompared to other projects, such as European Union membership or the Middle\nCorridor.
