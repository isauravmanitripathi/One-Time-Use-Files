Founded in 1949, it is Europe's\noldest intergovernmental organisation, representing 46 member states from\nEurope, with a population of approximately 675 million as of 2023[update]; it\noperates with an annual ordinary budget of approximately 500 million euros.\n\nThe organisation is distinct from the European Union (EU), although people\nsometimes confuse the two organisations \u2013 partly because the EU has adopted\nthe original European flag, designed for the Council of Europe in 1955, as\nwell as the European anthem. No country has ever joined the EU without first\nbelonging to the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe is an official\nUnited Nations observer.\n\nUnlike the EU, the Council of Europe cannot make binding laws; however, the\ncouncil has produced a number of international treaties, including the\nConvention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms\n(European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR) of 1953. Provisions from the\nconvention are incorporated in domestic law in many participating countries.\nThe best-known body of the Council of Europe is the European Court of Human\nRights, which rules on alleged violations of the ECHR.\n\nThe council's two statutory bodies are the Committee of Ministers, which\ncomprises the foreign ministers of each member state, and the Parliamentary\nAssembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which is composed of members of the\nnational parliaments of each member state. The Commissioner for Human Rights\nis an institution within the Council of Europe, mandated to promote awareness\nof and respect for human rights within the member states. The secretary\ngeneral presides over the secretariat of the organisation. Other major CoE\nbodies include the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines &\nHealthCare (EDQM) and the European Audiovisual Observatory.\n\nThe headquarters of the Council of Europe, as well as its Court of Human\nRights, are situated in Strasbourg, France. The Council uses English and\nFrench as its two official languages. The Committee of Ministers, the PACE,\nand the Congress of the Council of Europe also use German and Italian for some\nof their work.\n\nMember states of the Council of Europe. In addition, the European Convention\non Human Rights (ECHR) applies in Kosovo as a result of domestic incorporation\nof the ECHR."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In a speech in 1929, French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand floated the idea\nof an organisation which would gather European nations together in a \"federal\nunion\" to resolve common problems. The United Kingdom's wartime Prime Minister\nWinston Churchill first publicly suggested the creation of a \"Council of\nEurope\" in a BBC radio broadcast on 21 March 1943, while the Second World War\nwas still raging. In his own words, he tried to \"peer through the mists of the\nfuture to the end of the war\", and think about how to rebuild and maintain\npeace on a shattered continent. Given that Europe had been at the origin of\ntwo world wars, the creation of such a body would be, he suggested, \"a\nstupendous business\". He returned to the idea during a well-known speech at\nthe University of Zurich on 19 September 1946, throwing the full weight of his\nconsiderable post-war prestige behind it.\n\nAdditionally, there were also many other statesmen and politicians across the\ncontinent, many of them members of the European Movement, who were quietly\nworking towards the creation of the council. Some regarded it as a guarantee\nthat the horrors of war \u2013 or the human rights violations of the Nazi regime \u2013\ncould never again be visited on the continent, others came to see it as a\n\"club of democracies\", built around a set of common values that could stand as\na bulwark against totalitarian states belonging to the Eastern Bloc. Others\nagain saw it as a nascent \"United States of Europe\", the resonant phrase that\nChurchill had reached for at Zurich in 1946.\n\nSession of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly in the former House\nof Europe in Strasbourg in 1967. Willy Brandt, German Minister for Foreign\nAffairs, is speaking.\n\nThe future structure of the Council of Europe was discussed at the Congress of\nEurope, which brought together several hundred leading politicians, government\nrepresentatives and members of civil society in The Hague, Netherlands, in\n1948. Responding to the conclusions of the Congress of Europe, the\nConsultative Council of the Treaty of Brussels convened a Committee for the\nStudy of European Unity, which met eight times from November 1948 to January\n1949 to draw up the blueprint of a new broad-based European organisation.\n\nThere were two competing schools of thought: some favoured a classical\ninternational organisation with representatives of governments, while others\npreferred a political forum with parliamentarians. Both approaches were\nfinally combined through the creation of a Committee of Ministers (in which\ngovernments were represented) and a Consultative Assembly (in which\nparliaments were represented), the two main bodies mentioned in the Statute of\nthe Council of Europe. This dual intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary\nstructure was later copied for the European Communities, NATO and OSCE.\n\nThe Council of Europe was signed into existence on 5 May 1949 by the Treaty of\nLondon, the organisation's founding Statute which set out the three basic\nvalues that should guide its work: democracy, human rights and the rule of\nlaw. It was signed in London on that day by ten states: Belgium, Denmark,\nFrance, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the\nUnited Kingdom, though Turkey and Greece joined three months later. On 10\nAugust 1949, 100 members of the council's Consultative Assembly,\nparliamentarians drawn from the twelve member nations, met in Strasbourg for\nits first plenary session, held over 18 sittings and lasting nearly a month.\nThey debated how to reconcile and reconstruct a continent still reeling from\nwar, yet already facing a new East\u2013West divide, launched the radical concept\nof a trans-national court to protect the basic human rights of every citizen,\nand took the first steps in a process that would eventually lead to the\ncreation of an offshoot organisation, the European Union.\n\nIn August 1949, Paul-Henri Spaak resigned as Belgium's foreign minister in\norder to be elected as the first president of the assembly. Behind the scenes,\nhe too had been quietly working towards the creation of the council, and\nplayed a key role in steering its early work. However, in December 1951, after\nnearly three years in the role, Spaak resigned in disappointment after the\nAssembly rejected proposals for a \"European political authority\". Convinced\nthat the Council of Europe was never going to be in a position to achieve his\nlong-term goal of a unified Europe, he soon tried again in a new and more\npromising format, based this time on economic integration, becoming one of the\nfounders of the European Union."

They drew, in part, on the tenets of the\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, signed only a few months earlier in\nParis. But crucially, where the Universal Declaration was essentially\naspirational, the European Convention from the beginning featured an\nenforcement mechanism \u2013 an international Court \u2013 which was to adjudicate on\nalleged violations of its articles and to hold governments to account, a\ndramatic leap forward for international justice. Today, this is the European\nCourt of Human Rights, whose rulings are binding on 46 European nations, the\nmost far-reaching system of international justice anywhere in the world.\n\nOne of the council's first acts was to welcome West Germany into its fold on 2\nMay 1951, setting a pattern of post-war reconciliation that was to become a\nhallmark of the council, and beginning a long process of \"enlargement\" which\nwas to see the organisation grow from its original ten founding member states\nto the 46 nations that make up the Council of Europe today. Iceland had\nalready joined in 1950, followed in 1956 by Austria, Cyprus in 1961,\nSwitzerland in 1963 and Malta in 1965."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Article 1(a) of the Statute states that \"The aim of the Council of Europe is\nto achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding\nand realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage and\nfacilitating their economic and social progress.\" Membership is open to all\nEuropean states who seek harmony, cooperation, good governance and human\nrights, accepting the principle of the rule of law and are able and willing to\nguarantee democracy, fundamental human rights and freedoms.\n\nWhereas the member states of the European Union transfer part of their\nnational legislative and executive powers to the European Commission and the\nEuropean Parliament, Council of Europe member states maintain their\nsovereignty but commit themselves through conventions/treaties (international\nlaw) and co-operate on the basis of common values and common political\ndecisions. Those conventions and decisions are developed by the member states\nworking together at the Council of Europe. Both organisations function as\nconcentric circles around the common foundations for European cooperation and\nharmony, with the Council of Europe being the geographically wider circle. The\nEuropean Union could be seen as the smaller circle with a much higher level of\nintegration through the transfer of powers from the national to the EU level.\n\"The Council of Europe and the European Union: different roles, shared\nvalues.\" Council of Europe conventions/treaties are also open for signature to\nnon-member states, thus facilitating equal co-operation with countries outside\nEurope.\n\nThe Council of Europe's most famous achievement is the European Convention on\nHuman Rights, which was adopted in 1950 following a report by the PACE, and\nfollowed on from the United Nations 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights'\n(UDHR). The Convention created the European Court of Human Rights in\nStrasbourg. The Court supervises compliance with the European Convention on\nHuman Rights and thus functions as the highest European court. It is to this\ncourt that Europeans can bring cases if they believe that a member country has\nviolated their fundamental rights and freedoms.\n\nThe various activities and achievements of the Council of Europe can be found\nin detail on its official website. The Council of Europe works in the\nfollowing areas:\n\n* Protection of the rule of law and fostering legal co-operation through some 200 conventions and other treaties, including such leading instruments as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, Conventions against Corruption and Organised Crime, the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine.\n* CODEXTER, designed to co-ordinate counter-terrorism measures\n* The European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ)\n* Protection of human rights, notably through:\n* the European Convention on Human Rights\n* the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture\n* the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance\n* the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings\n* the Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data\n* the Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse\n* This has also included work in the sport area advocating for safe sport and developing safe sport policy self-assessment tools for national sport organisations\n* The Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence.\n* social rights under the European Social Charter\n* European Charter of Local Self-Government guaranteeing the political, administrative and financial independence of local authorities.\n* linguistic rights under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages\n* minority rights under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities\n* Media freedom under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Convention on Transfrontier Television\n* Protection of democracy through parliamentary scrutiny and election monitoring by its Parliamentary Assembly as well as assistance in democratic reforms, in particular by the Venice Commission.\n* Promotion of cultural cooperation and diversity under the Council of Europe's Cultural Convention of 1954 and several conventions on the protection of cultural heritage as well as through its Centre for Modern Languages in Graz, Austria, and its North-South Centre in Lisbon, Portugal.\n* Promotion of the right to education under Article 2 of the first Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights and several conventions on the recognition of university studies and diplomas (see also Bologna Process and Lisbon Recognition Convention).\n* Promotion of fair sport through the Anti-Doping Convention\n* Promotion of European youth exchanges and cooperation through European Youth Centres in Strasbourg and Budapest, Hungary.\n* Promotion of the quality of medicines throughout Europe by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and its European Pharmacopoeia.\n\n* Support for intercultural integration through the Intercultural Cities (ICC) programme.

Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland, the former Prime Minister of Norway, was elected Secretary General of the Council of Europe on 29 September 2009. In June 2014, he became the first Secretary General to be re-elected, commencing his second term in office on 1 October 2014.\n* The Committee of Ministers, comprising the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of all 46 member states who are represented by their Permanent Representatives and Ambassadors accredited to the Council of Europe. Committee of Ministers' presidencies are held in alphabetical order for six months following the English alphabet: Turkey 11/2010-05/2011, Ukraine 05/2011-11/2011, the United Kingdom 11/2011-05/2012, Albania 05/2012-11/2012, Andorra 11/2012-05/2013, Armenia 05/2013-11/2013, Austria 11/2013-05/2014, and so on.\n\nCouncil's Parliamentary Assembly hemicycle\n\n* The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which comprises national parliamentarians from all member states. Adopting resolutions and recommendations to governments, the Assembly holds a dialogue with its governmental counterpart, the Committee of Ministers, and is often regarded as the \"motor\" of the organisation. The national parliamentary delegations to the Assembly must reflect the political spectrum of their national parliament, i.e. comprise government and opposition parties. The Assembly appoints members as rapporteurs with the mandate to prepare parliamentary reports on specific subjects. The British MP Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe was rapporteur for the drafting of the European Convention on Human Rights. Dick Marty's reports on secret CIA detentions and rendition flights in Europe became quite famous in 2006 and 2007. Other Assembly reports were instrumental in, for example, the abolition of the death penalty in Europe, highlighting the political and human rights situation in Chechnya, identifying who was responsible for disappeared persons in Belarus, chronicling threats to freedom of expression in the media and many other subjects.\n* The Congress of Local and Regional Authorities, which was created in 1994 and comprises political representatives from local and regional authorities in all member states. The most influential instruments of the Council of Europe in this field are the European Charter of Local Self-Government of 1985 and the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities of 1980.\n* The European Court of Human Rights, created under the European Convention on Human Rights of 1950, is composed of a judge from each member state elected for a single, non-renewable term of nine years by the PACE and is headed by the elected president of the court. The current president of the court is Guido Raimondi from Italy. Under the recent Protocol No. 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the Court's case processing was reformed and streamlined. Ratification of Protocol No. 14 was delayed by Russia for a number of years, but won support to be passed in January 2010.\n* The Commissioner for Human Rights is elected by the PACE for a non-renewable term of six years since the creation of this position in 1999. Since April 2024, this position has been held by Michael O'Flaherty from Ireland.\n* The Conference of INGOs. NGOs can participate in the INGOs Conference of the Council of Europe. Since the [Resolution (2003)8] adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 19 November 2003, they are given a \"participatory status\".\n* The Joint Council on Youth of the Council of Europe. The European Steering Committee (CDEJ) on Youth and the Advisory Council on Youth (CCJ) of the Council of Europe form together the Joint Council on Youth (CMJ). The CDEJ brings together representatives of ministries or bodies responsible for youth matters from the 50 States Parties to the European Cultural Convention. The CDEJ fosters cooperation between governments in the youth sector and provides a framework for comparing national youth policies, exchanging best practices and drafting standard-setting texts. The Advisory Council on Youth comprises 30 representatives of non-governmental youth organisations and networks. It provides opinions and input from youth NGOs on all youth sector activities and ensures that young people are involved in the council's other activities.\n* Information Offices of the Council of Europe in many member states.\n\nEuropean Directorate for the Quality of Medicines"

After the fall of Communism with the Revolutions of 1989 and\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, the following countries in Europe joined:\nHungary (1990), Poland (1991), Bulgaria (1992), Estonia (1993), Lithuania\n(1993), Slovenia (1993), the Czech Republic (1993), Slovakia (1993), Romania\n(1993), Andorra (1994), Latvia (1995), Moldova (1995), Albania (1995), Ukraine\n(1995), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1995) (later renamed North\nMacedonia), Russia (1996, expelled 2022), Croatia (1996), Georgia (1999),\nArmenia (2001), Azerbaijan (2001), Bosnia and Herzegovina (2002), Serbia and\nMontenegro (later Serbia) (2003), Monaco (2004) and Montenegro (2007). After\nRussia being expelled in 2022, the council has 46 member states.\n\nAlthough most Council members are predominantly Christian in heritage, there\nare four Muslim-majority member states: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey,\nAlbania, and Azerbaijan.\n\nThe CoE has granted some countries a status that allows them to participate in\nCoE activities without being full members. There are three types of nonmember\nstatus: _associate member_ , _special guest_ and _observer_. Associate member\nstatus was created for former Axis states which had not yet regained their\nsovereignty since their defeat in the Second World War; as such, it is no\nlonger used, although there have been proposals to reactivate it to permit\nenhanced participation by the current observer states. \"Special guest\" status\nwas used as a transitional status for post-Soviet countries that wished to\njoin the council after the fall of the Berlin Wall and is no longer commonly\nused. \"Observer\" status is for non-European nations who accept democracy, rule\nof law, and human rights, and wish to participate in Council initiatives. The\nUnited States became an observer state in 1995. Currently, Canada, the Holy\nSee, Japan, Mexico, and the United States are observer states, while Israel is\nan observer to the PACE. Additionally Kosovo is a member of the Council of\nEurope Development Bank and a member of the Council of Europe's Venice\nCommission. The Assembly of Kosovo was invited to take part in the work of the\nParliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and its committees as an\nobserver in 2016. Two representatives of local government in Kosovo\nparticipate in the work of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities as\nobservers."

In 2014, after Russia\nannexed Crimea from Ukraine and supported separatists in eastern Ukraine, the\nCouncil stripped Russia of its voting rights in the PACE. In response, Russia\nbegan to boycott the Assembly in 2016, and beginning from 2017 ceased paying\nits annual membership dues of 32.6 million euros (US$37.1 million) to the\nCouncil placing the institution under financial strain.\n\nRussia stated that its suspension by the council was unfair, and demanded the\nrestoration of its voting rights. Russia had threatened to withdraw from the\nCouncil unless its voting rights were restored in time for the election of a\nnew secretary general. European Council secretary-general Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland\norganised a special committee to find a compromise with Russia in early 2018,\na move that was criticised by some as giving in to alleged Russian pressure by\nCouncil members and academic observers, especially if voting sanctions were\nlifted. In June 2019, an approximately two-thirds majority of the Council\nvoted (on a 118\u201362 vote, with 10 abstentions) to restore Russia's voting\nrights in the council. Opponents of lifting the suspension included Ukraine\nand other post-Soviet countries, such as the Baltic states, who argued that\nreadmission amounted to normalising Russia's malign activity. Supporters of\nrestoring Russia's council rights included France and Germany, which argued\nthat a Russian withdrawal from the council would be harmful because it would\ndeprive Russian citizens of their ability to initiate cases in the European\nCourt of Human Rights.\n\nOn 3 March 2022, after Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of\nUkraine, the council suspended Russia for violations of the council's statute\nand the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The suspension blocked\nRussia from participation in the council's ministerial council, the PACE, and\nthe Council of the Baltic Sea States, but still left Russia obligated to\nfollow the ECHR. On 15 March 2022, hours before the vote to expel the country,\nRussia initiated a voluntary withdrawal procedure from the council. The\nRussian delegation planned to deliver its formal withdrawal on 31 December\n2022, and announced its intent to denounce the ECHR. However, on the same day,\nthe council's Committee of Ministers decided Russia's membership in the\ncouncil would be terminated immediately, and determined that Russia had been\nexcluded from the Council instead under its exclusion mechanism rather than\nthe withdrawal mechanism. After being excluded from the Council of Europe,\nRussia's former president and prime minister Dmitry Medvedev endorsed\nrestoring the death penalty in Russia."
