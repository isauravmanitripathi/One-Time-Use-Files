        "generated_section_content_md": "In response to UN General Assembly resolution 63/311, in January 2010 the\nSecretary-General presented report A/64/588, entitled _Comprehensive Proposal\nfor the Composite Agency for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women_. In\nhis report, the Secretary-General resolved that, rather than relieving other\nparts of the United Nations system of their responsibility for contributing to\nthe promotion of gender equality and women's empowerment, the new agency\nshould seek to sharpen the focus and impact of the gender equality activities\nof the entire United Nations system. Additionally, Secretary-General Ban Ki-\nmoon estimated that approximately $125 million per annum were needed for\noperating costs and \"start-up\" capacity at the country, regional, and\nheadquarters levels. Moreover, an additional $375 million per annum were\nneeded in the initial phase to respond to country-level requests for\nprogrammatic support.\n\nAfter years of negotiations between UN member states, women's groups, and\ncivil society, on 2 July 2010 the General Assembly unanimously adopted\nresolution 64/289, thus creating UN Women by merging the Division for the\nAdvancement of Women (DAW); the International Research and Training Institute\nfor the Advancement of Women (INSTRAW, established in 1976); the Office of the\nSpecial Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women (OSAGI, established\nin 1997), and the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM, established in 1976).\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced at the founding of the movement that\nhe was \"grateful to Member States for having taken this major step forward for\nthe world's women and girls. UN Women will significantly boost UN efforts to\npromote gender equality, expand opportunity, and tackle discrimination around\nthe globe.\"\n\nOn 14 September 2010, it was announced that former President of Chile Michelle\nBachelet was appointed as head of UN Women. Various countries supported the\ncreation of the body and welcomed Bachelet as chief. During General Debate at\nthe opening of the 65th General Assembly of the UN, world leaders commended\nthe creation of the body and its intention to \"empower women\", as well as\nwelcoming Bachelet as the inaugural head. On 11 March 2011, John Hendra of\nCanada and Lakshmi Puri of India were appointed as first deputy executive\ndirectors at the level of UN Assistant Secretary-General.\n\nThe provisions set forth by resolution 63/311 on system-wide coherence,\nadopted by the General Assembly on 2 October 2010, constituted the blueprint\nfor UN Women. Seeking to strengthen the UN's institutional arrangements for\ngender equality and women empowerment, resolution 63/311 supported the\nconsolidation of four distinct parts of the UN system that focused exclusively\non gender equality and women's empowerment into a composite entity to be led\nby an Under-Secretary-General. Moreover, the resolution requested that the\nSecretary-General produce a proposal specifying the mission statement of the\ncomposite entity and its organizational arrangements, including an\norganizational chart, funding, and the executive board to oversee its\noperational activities."

The suggestions were all sexist or misogynist. A\nsimilar campaign was also run to raise awareness for gay rights.\n\nUN Women promotes the rights of LGBTIQ people.\n\nUN Women advocates an intersectional feminism.\n\nAlso in late 2013, UN Women launched a constitutional database that examines\nconstitutions through a gender lens. The first of its kind, this database maps\nthe principles and rules that guarantee, deny, or protect the rights of women\nand girls around the world. This tool for gender equality and human rights\nactivists is annually updated and searchable, and provides a comprehensive\noverview of the current status of provisions relevant to women's rights and\ngender equality across various countries throughout the world. Users can\nsearch though the database by keyword, and legal provisions are grouped into\n16 categories that were carefully defined by reviewing the constitutions from\na human rights perspective.\n\nUN Women is one of the lead agencies coordinating International Women's Day\nevents as well as the Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nThe year 2015 marked a number of milestones, such as the 20th anniversary of\nthe Fourth World Conference on Women and adoption of the Beijing Declaration\nand Platform for Action, which was the focus of the 59th session of the\nCommission on the Status of Women (CSW59) from 9\u201320 March 2015, where global\nleaders took stock of progress and remaining challenges for implementing this\nlandmark agreement for gender equality and women's rights. UN Women played an\nactive role in major intergovernmental negotiations and processes including\nthe Financing for Development Conference in Addis Ababa in July 2015, the\noutcome of which was strong on the need to adequately fund gender equality and\nincorporate it in development planning, as well as the negotiations and\nsuccessful adoption of the new post-2015 development agenda on 25 September\n2015. The new global development roadmap includes a stand-alone goal on gender\nequality and women's empowerment (Sustainable Development Goal 5), and\nmainstreams these priorities throughout all 17 goals.\n\nSustainable Development Goal #5: Gender Equality"

Sarah Weiss Maudi, senior adviser to\nthe president of the 77th Session of the U.N. General Assembly, said that UN\nWomen refused to acknowledge that atrocities were committed against Israeli\nwomen and young girls despite many of the atrocities having been filmed by\nHamas and other Palestinian terrorists themselves.\n\nOn 13 October, an initial statement by UN Women condemned the attack on\nIsraeli civilians but did not mention women. Subsequent posts and comments by\nthe organization focused only on the impact of the conflict on Palestinian\nwomen. A month after the attack, the UN Women's website contained only one\nreference to women and girls stating the following, \u201cdevastating impact of the\ncrisis in Gaza on women and girls.\u201d Michal Herzog, First Lady of Israel,\ncriticized UN Women for having a \"double standard\" and has lobbied openly\nabout the topic. Several women's rights group criticized UN Women, as did\nCanadian Anne Bayefsky, director of the Touro University Institute on Human\nRights and the Holocaust.\"\n\nOn 29 November, over 80 members of the U.S. House of Representatives accused\nUN Women of disregarding Hamas\u2019s gender based violence on Israeli females and\nminors in a bipartisan letter driven by Representatives Young Kim\n(R-California) and Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick (D-Florida). The 80\nRepresentatives wrote to UN Women Executive Director Sima Bahous stating, \"The\nfailure by UN Women to publicly stand up for Israeli women and condemn Hamas\u2019\nsystematic atrocities undermines UN Women and highlights its one-sided\napproach.\"\n\nUN Women states that it was one of the first organisations to condemn the\nattacks by Hamas and their use of gender-based violence. In regards to a\ndeleted post condemning the Hamas attacks, a representative for UN Women gave\na statement to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency saying, \u201cIn any social media team\nmanaging multiple campaigns and during a very busy time like the one we are\nnow in with 16 Days of Activism, mistakes can occur.\u201d\n\nIsrael's ambassador to the UN criticized UN Women and UN Secretary General\nAntonio Guterres for the delay in calling an investigation into the sexual\nviolence committed by Hamas on 7 October 2023.\n\nA corresponding protest event took place at the UN on December 4, 2023."
