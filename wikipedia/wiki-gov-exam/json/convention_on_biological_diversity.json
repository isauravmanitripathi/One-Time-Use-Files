        "generated_section_content_md": "International treaty on biological diversity\n\nThe **Convention on Biological Diversity** (**CBD**), known informally as the\n**Biodiversity Convention** , is a multilateral treaty. The Convention has\nthree main goals: the conservation of biological diversity (or biodiversity);\nthe sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of\nbenefits arising from genetic resources. Its objective is to develop national\nstrategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity,\nand it is often seen as the key document regarding sustainable development.\n\nThe Convention was opened for signature at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro\non 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. The United States\nis the only UN member state which has not ratified the Convention. It has two\nsupplementary agreements, the Cartagena Protocol and Nagoya Protocol.\n\nThe Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to the Convention on Biological Diversity\nis an international treaty governing the movements of living modified\norganisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology from one country to\nanother. It was adopted on 29 January 2000 as a supplementary agreement to the\nCBD and entered into force on 11 September 2003.\n\nThe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable\nSharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization (ABS) to the Convention on\nBiological Diversity is another supplementary agreement to the CBD. It\nprovides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one\nof the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits\narising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Nagoya Protocol was\nadopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Japan, and entered into force on 12\nOctober 2014.\n\n2010 was also the International Year of Biodiversity, and the Secretariat of\nthe CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories at\nNagoya, the UN declared 2011 to 2020 as the United Nations Decade on\nBiodiversity in December 2010. The Convention's _Strategic Plan for\nBiodiversity 2011\u20132020_ , created in 2010, include the Aichi Biodiversity\nTargets.\n\nThe meetings of the Parties to the Convention are known as Conferences of the\nParties (COP), with the first one (COP 1) held in Nassau, Bahamas, in 1994 and\nthe most recent one (COP 16) in 2024 in Cali, Colombia.\n\nIn the area of marine and coastal biodiversity CBD's focus at present is to\nidentify Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSAs) in\nspecific ocean locations based on scientific criteria. The aim is to create an\ninternational legally binding instrument (ILBI) involving area-based planning\nand decision-making under UNCLOS to support the conservation and sustainable\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction (BBNJ\ntreaty or High Seas Treaty)."

        "section_name": "Origin and scope",
        "generated_section_content_md": "The notion of an international convention on biodiversity was conceived at a\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on\nBiological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working\nGroup of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a\nlegal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological\ndiversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization\nwith sovereign states and local communities. In 1991, an intergovernmental\nnegotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the Convention's\ntext.\n\nA Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on\nBiological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions\nwere distilled in the Nairobi Final Act. The Convention's text was opened for\nsignature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and\nDevelopment (the Rio \"Earth Summit\"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the\nConvention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December\n1993.\n\nThe Convention recognized for the first time in international law that the\nconservation of biodiversity is \"a common concern of humankind\" and is an\nintegral part of the development process. The agreement covers all ecosystems,\nspecies, and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to\nthe economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets\nprinciples for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the\nuse of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use. It also\ncovers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its Cartagena\nProtocol on Biosafety, addressing technology development and transfer,\nbenefit-sharing and biosafety issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally\nbinding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its\nprovisions.\n\nThe Convention reminds decision-makers of the finite status of natural\nresources and sets out a philosophy of sustainable use. While past\nconservation efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats,\nthe Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for\nthe benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate\nthat does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.\n\nThe Convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the precautionary\nprinciple which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction\nor loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not\nbe used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a\nthreat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required\nto conserve biological diversity. It argues, however, that conservation will\nbring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of\ngeoengineering."

        "generated_section_content_md": "There have been criticisms against CBD that its implementation has been\nweakened due to resistance of Western countries to the implementation of pro-\nSouth provisions of the Convention. CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard\ntreaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory. The argument to enforce the\ntreaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of\nParties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength.\n\nAlthough the Convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered\nby its provisions, examination of reports and of national biodiversity\nstrategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in\npractice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for\nexample, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants,\nbut does not mention bacteria, fungi or protists at all. The International\nSociety for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD\ndocuments for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in\none of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less\nthan 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously\ndeficient or totally deficient.\n\nScientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears\nthat the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will hamper disease\nprevention and conservation efforts, and that the threat of imprisonment of\nscientists will have a chilling effect on research. Non-commercial researchers\nand institutions such as natural history museums fear maintaining biological\nreference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become\ndifficult, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the\nprotocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via\nGenBank.\n\nWilliam Yancey Brown, when with the Brookings Institution, suggested that the\nConvention on Biological Diversity should include the preservation of intact\ngenomes and viable cells for every known species and for new species as they\nare discovered."
