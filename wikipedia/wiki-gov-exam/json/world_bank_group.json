        "generated_section_content_md": "Group making loans to developing countries\n\nThe **World Bank Group** (**WBG**) is a family of five international\norganizations that make leveraged loans to developing countries. It is the\nlargest and best-known development bank in the world and an observer at the\nUnited Nations Development Group. The bank is headquartered in Washington,\nD.C., in the United States. It provided around $98.83 billion in loans and\nassistance to \"developing\" and transition countries in the 2021 fiscal year.\nThe bank's stated mission is to achieve the twin goals of ending extreme\npoverty and building shared prosperity. Total lending as of 2015 for the last\n10 years through Development Policy Financing was approximately $117 billion.\nIts five organizations have been established over time:\n\n  * International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), 1944\n  * International Development Association (IDA), 1960\n  * International Finance Corporation (IFC), 1956\n  * International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), 1965\n  * Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), 1988\n\nThe first two are sometimes collectively referred to as the **World Bank**.\nThey provide loans and grants to the governments of low- and middle-income\ncountries for the purpose of pursuing economic development. These activities\ninclude fields such as human development (e.g. education, health), agriculture\nand rural development (e.g. irrigation and rural services), environmental\nprotection (e.g. pollution reduction, establishing and enforcing regulations),\ninfrastructure (e.g. roads, urban regeneration, and electricity), large\nindustrial construction projects, and governance (e.g. anti-corruption, legal\ninstitutions development). The IBRD and IDA provide loans at preferential\nrates to member countries, as well as grants to the poorest countries. Loans\nor grants for specific projects are often linked to wider policy changes in\nthe sector or the country's economy as a whole. For example, a loan to improve\ncoastal environmental management may be linked to the development of new\nenvironmental institutions at national and local levels and the implementation\nof new regulations to limit pollution. Furthermore, the World Bank Group is\nrecognized as a leading funder of climate investments in developing countries.\n\nThe World Bank was established along with the International Monetary Fund at\nthe 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. Initially, its loans helped rebuild\ncountries devastated by World War II. Over time, it has shifted its focus to\ndevelopment, with a stated mission of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting\nshared prosperity.\n\nThe World Bank is a member of the United Nations Sustainable Development\nGroup. It is governed by its 189 member countries, though the United States,\nas its largest shareholder, has traditionally appointed its president. The\ncurrent president is Ajay Banga, appointed in June 2023. The Bank's lending\nand operational decisions are made by a president and a board of 25 executive\ndirectors. The largest voting powers are held by the U.S. (15.85%), Japan\n(6.84%), China (4.42%), Germany (4.00%), and the United Kingdom (3.75%).\n\nThe Bank's activities span all sectors of development. It provides financing,\npolicy advice, and technical assistance to governments, and also focuses on\nprivate sector development through its sister organizations. The Bank's work\nis guided by environmental and social safeguards to mitigate harm to people\nand the environment. In addition to its lending operations, it serves as one\nof the world's largest centers of development research and knowledge,\npublishing numerous reports and hosting an Open Knowledge Repository. Current\npriorities include financing for climate action and responding to global\ncrises like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe World Bank has been criticized for the harmful effects of its policies and\nfor its governance structure. Critics argue that the loan conditions attached\nto its structural adjustment programs in the 1980s and 1990s were detrimental\nto the social welfare of developing nations. The Bank has also been criticized\nfor being dominated by wealthy countries, and for its environmental record on\ncertain projects."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Harry Dexter White (left) and John Maynard Keynes, the \"founding fathers\" of\nboth the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)\n\nThe World Bank was created at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference (1\u201322 July\n1944), along with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The president of the\nWorld Bank is traditionally an American. The World Bank and the IMF are both\nbased in Washington, D.C., and work closely with each other.\n\nThe Gold Room at the Mount Washington Hotel where the International Monetary\nFund and World Bank were established\n\nAlthough many countries were represented at the Bretton Woods Conference, the\nUnited States and United Kingdom were the most powerful in attendance and\ndominated the negotiations. The intention behind the founding of the World\nBank was to provide temporary loans to low-income countries that could not\nobtain loans commercially. The bank may also make loans and demand policy\nreforms from recipients.\n\nThe World Bank Group came into formal existence on 27 December 1946, following\ninternational ratification of the Bretton Woods agreements. The Conference\nalso provided the foundation of the Osiander Committee in 1951, responsible\nfor the preparation and evaluation of the World Development Report. Commencing\noperations on 25 June 1946, the bank approved its first loan on 9 May 1947\n(US$250 million to France for postwar reconstruction - in real terms, the\nlargest loan the bank has issued to date).\n\nIn its early years, the bank made a slow start for two reasons: it was\nunderfunded, and there were leadership struggles between the US executive\ndirector and the president of the organization. When the Marshall Plan went\ninto effect in 1947, many European countries began receiving aid from other\nsources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-\nEuropean allies. Until 1968, its loans were earmarked for the construction of\ninfrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants,\nthat would generate enough income to enable a borrower country to repay the\nloan. In 1960, the International Development Association was formed (as\nopposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing\ncountries.\n\nBefore 1974, the reconstruction and development loans the World Bank made were\nrelatively small. Its staff was aware of the need to instill confidence in the\nbank. Fiscal conservatism ruled, and loan applications had to meet strict\ncriteria.\n\nThe first country to receive a World Bank loan was France in 1947. The bank's\npresident at the time, John McCloy, chose France over two other applicants,\nPoland and Chile. The loan was for US$250 million, half the amount requested,\nand came with strict conditions. France had to agree to produce a balanced\nbudget and give priority of debt repayment to the World Bank over other\ngovernments. World Bank staff closely monitored the use of the funds to ensure\nthat the French government met the conditions. In addition, before the loan\nwas approved, the United States Department of State told the French government\nthat its members associated with the Communist Party would first have to be\nremoved. The French government complied and removed the Communist coalition\ngovernment\u2014the so-called tripartite. Within hours, the loan to France was\napproved.\n\nFrom 1974 to 1980, the bank concentrated on meeting the basic needs of people\nin the developing world. The size and number of loans to borrowers greatly\nincreased, as loan targets expanded from infrastructure into social services\nand other sectors.\n\nThese changes can be attributed to Robert McNamara, who was appointed to the\npresidency in 1968 by Lyndon B. Johnson. McNamara implored bank treasurer\nEugene Rotberg to seek out new sources of capital outside of the northern\nbanks that had been the primary sources of funding. Rotberg used the global\nbond market to increase the capital available to the bank. One consequence of\nthe period of poverty alleviation lending was the rapid rise of debt of\ndeveloping countries. From 1976 to 1980, developing world debt rose at an\naverage annual rate of 20%.\n\nThe World Bank Administrative Tribunal was established in 1980, to decide on\ndisputes between the World Bank Group and its staff where allegation of non-\nobservance of contracts of employment or terms of appointment had not been\nhonored.\n\nMcNamara was succeeded by U.S. President Jimmy Carter's nominee, Alden W.\nClausen, in 1980. Clausen replaced many members of McNamara's staff and\ncrafted a different mission emphasis. His 1982 decision to replace the bank's\nChief Economist, Hollis B. Chenery, with Anne Krueger was an example of this\nnew focus. Krueger was known for her criticism of development funding and for\ndescribing developing countries' governments as \"rent-seeking states\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, the bank emphasized lending to service debt of developing\ncountries, and structural adjustment policies designed to streamline the\neconomies of developing nations. UNICEF reported in the late 1980s that the\nstructural adjustment programs of the World Bank had been responsible for\n\"reduced health, nutritional and educational levels for tens of millions of\nchildren in Asia, Latin America, and Africa\"."

Zoellick, the former president of the World Bank, said\nwhen the loans were announced on 15 December 2007, that IDA money \"is the core\nfunding that the poorest developing countries rely on\".\n\nWorld Bank organizes the Development Marketplace Awards, a grant program that\nsurfaces and funds development projects with potential for development impact\nthat are scalable or replicable. The grant beneficiaries are social\nenterprises with projects that aim to deliver social and public services to\ngroups with the lowest incomes.[_citation needed_]"

The bank defined _shared\nprosperity_ as increasing the income of the bottom 40 percent of the\npopulation in each country. As a result, reducing inequality, in this\ndefinition, had become an integral part of the World Bank's objectives.\n\nThe World Bank has been criticized for not embracing the reduction of\ninequality (be it economic inequality within a country, or international\ninequality between countries) as a goal. Instead, the bank has taken an\ninstrumental approach to the issue, in which inequality policies were seen as\nuseful as long as they contributed to reducing (extreme) poverty or promoting\naverage economic growth.\n\nAs part of the _2030 Agenda_ , Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) aim to\nreduce inequalities within countries and among countries. World Bank officials\nparticipated in the negotiations for SDG 10 in the years prior to 2015. They\nadvocated for the adoption of the bank's own preferred benchmarks. The World\nBank is also one of nine custodian agencies for SDG 10.\n\nThe bank has stated its ambition to help catalyze the SDGs through \"thought\nleadership, global convening, and country-level uptake\". However, scholars\nhave stated that the World Bank strategically uses the power of the\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in its favor to reinforce its own\npolicies or interests while minimizing the chance of being itself reshaped or\ntransformed by these goals."

Lack of action on climate change threatens to make the\n> world our children inherit a completely different world than we are living\n> in today. Climate change is one of the single biggest challenges facing\n> development, and we need to assume the moral responsibility to take action\n> on behalf of future generations, especially the poorest.\n\nA World Bank report into climate change in 2012 noted that (p. xiii) \"even\nwith the current mitigation commitments and pledges fully implemented, there\nis roughly a 20 percent likelihood of exceeding 4 \u00b0C by 2100.\" This is despite\nthe fact that the \"global community has committed itself to holding warming\nbelow 2 \u00b0C to prevent 'dangerous' climate change\". Furthermore, \"a series of\nrecent extreme events worldwide highlight the vulnerability of all countries\n... No nation will be immune to the impacts of climate change.\"\n\nThe World Bank doubled its aid for climate change adaptation from $2.3bn\n(\u00a31.47bn) in 2011 to $4.6bn in 2012. The planet is now 0.8 \u00b0C warmer than in\npre-industrial times. It says that 2 \u00b0C warming will be reached in 20 to 30\nyears.\n\nThe World Bank has been assigned temporary management responsibility of the\nClean Technology Fund (CTF), focused on making renewable energy cost-\ncompetitive with coal-fired power as quickly as possible, but this may not\ncontinue after UN's Copenhagen climate change conference in December 2009,\nbecause of the bank's continued investment in coal-fired power plants.\n\nIn December 2017, Kim announced the World Bank would no longer finance fossil\nfuel development, but a 2019 International Consortium of Investigative\nJournalists article found that the bank continues \"to finance oil and gas\nexploration, pipelines and refineries,\" that \"these fossil fuel investments\nmake up a greater share of the bank's current energy lending portfolio than\nrenewable projects,\" and that the bank \"has yet to meaningfully shift away\nfrom fossil fuels.\"\n\nEU finance ministers joined civil sector groups, including Extinction\nRebellion, in November 2019 in calling for an end to World Bank funding of\nfossil fuels.\n\nIn 2021, the World Bank offered support to Kazakhstan to help the country in\nits mission for decarbonization and carbon neutrality.\n\nIn 2023 a new president was appointed: Ajay Banga. He was supported by the\nAmerican president Joe Biden partly because he supports climate action. The\nformer president David Malpass faced criticism as he challenged the scientific\nconsensus on climate change.\n\nIn May 2024, the board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage held its\nfirst historic meeting abroad in Abu Dhabi. This important UN Climate Change\ninitiative was operationalized during the COP28 UN Climate Change Conference\nin December 2023. During the three-day meeting, the board elected Jean-\nChristophe Donnellier of France and Richard Sherman of South Africa as co-\nchairs. Furthermore, initiating a process to select an executive director, the\nboard started working on access modalities, financial instruments, facilities,\narrangements, and ensuring observer participation in the board meetings and\nrelated proceedings. An essential part of the meeting was the discussion\nbetween the board and the World Bank on establishing the fund as a World Bank-\nhosted financial intermediary fund (FIF), specifically focusing on ensuring\nthat the most vulnerable frontline communities can access the fund's resources\ndirectly."

Stiglitz is equally critical of the International Monetary\nFund, the US Treasury Department, and the US and other developed country trade\nnegotiators. Hazlitt argued that the World Bank along with the monetary system\nit was designed within would promote world inflation and \"a world in which\ninternational trade is State-dominated\" when they were being advocated.\nStiglitz argued that the free market reform policies that the bank advocates\nare often harmful to economic development if implemented badly, too quickly\n(\"shock therapy\"), in the wrong sequence or in weak, uncompetitive economies.\n\nCritics argue that the so-called free market reform policies\u2014which the bank\nadvocates in many cases\u2014in practice are often harmful to economic development\nif implemented badly, too quickly (\"shock therapy\"), in the wrong sequence, or\nin very weak, uncompetitive economies. World Bank loan agreements can also\nforce procurements of goods and services at uncompetitive, non-free-market,\nprices. Other critical writers, such as John Perkins, label the international\nfinancial institutions as 'illegal and illegitimate and a cog of coercive\nAmerican diplomacy in carrying out financial terrorism.\n\nDefenders of the World Bank contend that no country is forced to borrow its\nmoney. The bank provides both loans and grants. Even the loans are\nconcessional since they are given to countries that have no access to\ninternational capital markets. Furthermore, the loans, both to poor and\nmiddle-income countries, are below market-value interest rates. The World Bank\nargues that it can help development more through loans than grants because\nmoney repaid on the loans can then be lent for other projects.\n\nThe IFC and MIGA and their way of evaluating the social and environmental\nimpact of their projects has also been criticized. Critics state that even\nthough IFC and MIGA have more of these standards than the World Bank, they\nmostly rely on private-sector clients to monitor their implementation and miss\nan independent monitoring institution in this context. This is why an\nextensive review of the institutions' implementation strategy of social and\nenvironmental standards is demanded.\n\nOne of the most common criticisms of the World Bank has been the way it is\ngoverned. While the World Bank represents 188 countries, it is run by a small\nnumber of economically powerful countries. These countries (which also provide\nmost of the institution's funding) choose the bank's leadership and senior\nmanagement, and their interests dominate. Titus Alexander argues that the\nunequal voting power of western countries and the World Bank's role in\ndeveloping countries makes it similar to the South African Development Bank\nunder apartheid, and therefore a pillar of global apartheid.\n\nIn the 1990s, the World Bank and the IMF forged the Washington Consensus,\npolicies that included deregulation and liberalization of markets,\nprivatization and the downscaling of government. Though the Washington\nConsensus was conceived as a policy that would best promote development, it\nwas criticized for ignoring equity, employment, and how reforms like\nprivatization were carried out. Stiglitz argued that the Washington Consensus\nplaced too much emphasis on GDP growth and not enough on the permanence of\ngrowth or on whether growth contributed to better living standards.\n\nThe United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations report criticized the\nWorld Bank and other international financial institutions for focusing too\nmuch \"on issuing loans rather than on achieving concrete development results\nwithin a finite period of time\" and called on the institution to \"strengthen\nanti-corruption efforts\".\n\nJames Ferguson has argued that the main effect of many development projects\ncarried out by the World Bank and similar organizations is not the alleviation\nof poverty. Instead, the projects often serve to expand the exercise of\nbureaucratic state power. His case studies of development projects in Thaba-\nTseka show that the World Bank's characterization of the economic conditions\nin Lesotho was flawed, and the bank ignored the political and cultural\ncharacter of the state in crafting its projects. As a result, the projects\nfailed to help the poor but succeeded in expanding the government bureaucracy.\n\nCriticism of the World Bank and other organizations often takes the form of\nprotesting, such as the World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests, the 2007 October\nRebellion, and the 1999 Battle of Seattle. Such demonstrations have occurred\nall over the world, even among the Brazilian Kayapo people.\n\nAnother source of criticism has been the tradition of having an American head\nthe bank, implemented because the United States provides the majority of World\nBank funding. \"When economists from the World Bank visit poor countries to\ndispense cash and advice,\" observed _The Economist_ in 2012, \"they routinely\ntell governments to reject cronyism and fill each important job with the best\ncandidate available. It is good advice. The World Bank should take it.\"\n\nIn 2021, an independent inquiry of the World Bank's _Doing Business_ reports\nby the law firm WilmerHale found that World Bank leaders, including then-Chief\nExecutive Kristalina Georgieva and then-President Jim Yong Kim, pressured\nstaff members of the bank to alter data to inflate the rankings for China,\nSaudi Arabia, Azerbaijan and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn September 2023, it was revealed that the World Bank had poured billions of\ndollars into fossil fuel projects in 2022. Campaigners estimated that about\n$3.7bn in trade finance was supplied to oil and gas projects despite the World\nBank's green pledges."

The 1979 energy crisis\nplunged many countries into economic crisis. The World Bank responded with\nstructural adjustment loans, which distributed aid to struggling countries\nwhile enforcing policy changes in order to reduce inflation and fiscal\nimbalance. Some of these policies included encouraging production, investment\nand labour-intensive manufacturing, changing real exchange rates, and altering\nthe distribution of government resources. Structural adjustment policies were\nmost effective in countries with an institutional framework that allowed these\npolicies to be implemented easily. For some countries, particularly in Sub-\nSaharan Africa, economic growth regressed and inflation worsened.\n\nBy the late 1980s, some international organizations began to believe that\nstructural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world's poor, due\nto a reduction in social spending and an increase in the price of food, as\nsubsidies were lifted. It also have been criticized for being Debt-trap\ndiplomacy. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans, allowing for\nsocial spending to be maintained, and encouraging a slower change to policies\nsuch as transfer of subsidies and price rises. In 1999, the World Bank and the\nIMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach to replace\nstructural adjustment loans."

On\nthe recording, staff were reportedly told Robert Malpass was a \"prince\" and an\n\"important little fellow\" who could go \"running to daddy.\" Bank officials also\nbelieved David Malpass was more influential than then-US Treasury Secretary\nSteven Mnuchin, who they said \"has little or no clue on things.\" In April\n2018, the US Treasury had changed its position to back a $13 billion capital\ninfusion for the bank.\n\nMalpass served as undersecretary of the US Treasury in the Trump\nadministration before being appointed by Trump in February 2019 to be World\nBank's president. Before Malpass became president, his son Robert had joined\nthe International Finance Corporation (IFC), a branch of the World Bank Group\nthat lends money to private sector businesses and whose USD 5.5 billion\nfunding from a USD 13 billion World Bank capital increase was secured by the\nUS Treasury at the time that David Malpass was the Treasury's undersecretary."

The\npresident is responsible for chairing meetings of the boards of directors and\nfor overall management of the bank.\n\nTraditionally, based on a tacit understanding between the United States and\nEurope, the president of the World Bank has been selected from candidates\nnominated by the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank. The World\nBank tends to lend more readily to countries that are friendly with the United\nStates, not because of direct U.S. influence but because of the employees of\nthe World Bank. The nominee is subject to confirmation by the board of\nexecutive directors to serve a five-year, renewable term. While most World\nBank presidents have had banking experience, some have not.\n\nOn 23 March 2012, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that the United States\nwould nominate Jim Yong Kim as the next president of the bank. Jim Yong Kim\nwas elected on 27 April 2012 and reelected to a second five-year term in 2017.\nHe announced his resignation effective 1 February 2019 and was replaced on an\ninterim basis by now-former World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, then by David\nMalpass on 9 April 2019. Malpass faced criticism in 2023 as he had \"sparked\noutcry by appearing to question the role of humans in climate change\".\n\nIn 2023, a new president was appointed: Ajay Banga. His term began on 2 June\n2023. He was supported by the American president Joe Biden partly because he\nsupports climate action. He is also expected to help low-income countries deal\nwith debts.
