In the early years, the training programmes were more of\na long-term nature, while recent programmes have been focusing on providing\nadvanced skills and experience sharing aimed at arriving at the best practices\nin different fields of economic and social activities as a means of good\npolicy making and governance. The current programmes of the Colombo Plan are\nin the areas of public policy formulation in an environment of globalisation\nand market economy, private sector development as a prime mover for growth,\ndrug use and dependence prevention and treatment in member countries and\naddressing gender issues. The Colombo Plan Staff College for Technician\nEducation located in Manila also provides skill development opportunities for\ntechnicians in middle level.\n\nIn her 2010 speech, Dato' Patricia Yoon-Moi Chia states: \"The current Colombo\nPlan looks very different since our restructuring and revitalisation in 1995.\nAs we continue to build upon our past successes, the new Colombo Plan uses\ncooperation among developing member countries or South-south Cooperation\nbetween the developed member countries and developing member countries, to\nunderpin all our activities. Since our restructuring in 1995, we have now\nprovided 16,082 scholarships to 23 member countries for both long-term and\nshort-term training programmes.\""

Some Asians see in it only\nthe hand of British imperialism, especially as it is not aimed at developing\nnational self-sufficiency. It offers an almost exclusively economic solution\nfor problems which are also political and social. Dangerous issues such as\nlandlordism and the organisation of labour, which invite Communist\nexploitation, are barely touched on, doubtless because it seemed politically\ninexpedient to raise such questions."
