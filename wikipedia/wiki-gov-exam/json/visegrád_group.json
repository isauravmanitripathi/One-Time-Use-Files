        "generated_section_content_md": "Cultural and political alliance in Europe\n\nThe **Visegr\u00e1d Group** (also known as the **Visegr\u00e1d Four** or the **V4**) is\na cultural and political alliance of four Central European countries: the\nCzech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The alliance aims to advance\nco-operation in military, economic, cultural and energy affairs. All four\nnations are also members of the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty\nOrganization, and the Three Seas Initiative.\n\nThe alliance traces its origins to the summit meetings of leaders of\nCzechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland, held in the Hungarian castle town of\nVisegr\u00e1d on 15 February 1991. Visegr\u00e1d was chosen as the location for the\nsummits as an intentional allusion to the medieval Congress of Visegr\u00e1d\nbetween John I of Bohemia, Charles I of Hungary, and Casimir III of Poland in\n1335.\n\nAfter the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1993, the Czech Republic and\nSlovakia became independent members of the alliance, increasing the number of\nmembers from three to four. All four members of the Visegr\u00e1d Group joined the\nEuropean Union on 1 May 2004, achieving its main goal.\n\nDuring the European immigration crisis in 2015, the Visegrad Group\nsuccessfully blocked EU-level actions aimed at implementing the forced\nrelocation of illegal immigrants within the member states. At that time EU\nCommission started infringement procedures against actions of the Hungarian\nand Polish national-conservative governments, claiming that they undermine\ndemocracy, media freedom, and the independence of the judiciary. The Visegrad\nFour became politically split due to changes in governments and diverging\nreactions to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Yet its role in\nfostering exchange among countries' public servants and civil societies\n(Visegrad Fund) remains crucial. If the Visegr\u00e1d Group were a single country,\nits land area, population, and economy would be similar to those of\nMetropolitan France."

Charles I of Hungary, Casimir III of Poland, and\nJohn I of Bohemia agreed to create new commercial routes to bypass the city of\nVienna (a staple port, which required goods to be offloaded and offered for\nsale in the city before they could be sold elsewhere) and to obtain easier\naccess to other European markets. The recognition of Czech sovereignty over\nthe Duchy of Silesia was also confirmed. The second Congress of Visegr\u00e1d took\nplace in 1339 and decided that if Casimir III of Poland died without a son (as\nactually happened in 1370), then the son of Charles I of Hungary, Louis I of\nHungary would become the King of Poland.\n\nFrom the 16th century, large parts of the present-day territories of the\ngroup's members became part of, or were influenced, by the Vienna-based\nHabsburg monarchy. This situation continued until the end of World War I and\nthe dissolution of Habsburg-ruled Austria-Hungary in 1918. In the three years\nafter the end of World War II in 1945 the countries became satellite states of\nthe Soviet Union, as the Polish People's Republic, the Hungarian People's\nRepublic and the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. In 1989, the fall of the\nBerlin Wall and the fall of communism in central and eastern Europe enabled\nPoland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to adopt capitalism and democracy. In\nDecember 1991, the fall of the Soviet Union occurred, further allowing the\nthree countries to look westward."

Since then, the Visegrad Group has focused mostly on\ncultural cooperation through the Visegrad Fund and expert-level cooperation on\ntopics such as infrastructure. The group became politically active and media\nvisible during the European Migration Crisis in 2015. The Visegrad countries\nforcefully fought against the EU quota that aimed to distribute Syrian\nrefugees from the overwhelmed southern EU countries across the continent. The\ncoherence of the group decreased with the lower salience of migration in the\nsubsequent years.\n\nThe full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022 caused a rift within the\ngroup. The Hungarian government under Viktor Orb\u00e1n and the Slovak government\nunder Robert Fico rejected support for Ukraine and echoed Russian claims that\nthe war had been provoked by NATO. On the other hand, the Czech government\nunder Petr Fiala and the Polish government under Donald Tusk are among the\nstrongest supporters of Ukraine. This rift was highlighted by the summit in\nPrague in 2024, where Fiala said it \"wouldn't make sense that we differ in the\nviews of the cause of the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the ways of\nsolving it.\" Polish Foreign Minister Rados\u0142aw Sikorski also stressed that the\npriority for Poland (the largest country in the group) should be collaboration\nwithin the Weimar Triangle (Poland, Germany, France) and with the US, rather\nthan with the Visegrad Four.\n\nWhile some Czech politicians even called for leaving the Visegrad Four, V\u00edt\nDost\u00e1l, head of the foreign policy think-tank AMO, argued that the V4 survived\nmany governments with differing foreign policy priorities. He highlighted V4's\ncrucial role in networking among public servants (down to the level of\nministerial experts), which helps the four countries in EU negotiations - as\nwell as networking among civil society actors."
