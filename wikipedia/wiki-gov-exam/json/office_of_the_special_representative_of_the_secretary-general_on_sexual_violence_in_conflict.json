It\nincludes experts from the Department of Peacekeeping Operations (DPO), the\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the United\nNations Development Programme (UNDP), which serve as co-lead entities. In\naddition, the Team is complemented by a law enforcement expert seconded by the\nGovernment of Sweden and a reparations expert. Pursuant to Security Council\nResolution 1888 (2009), the Team focuses on: (i) working closely with national\nlegal and judicial officials and other personnel in the relevant governments'\ncivilian and military justice systems to address impunity, including by\nstrengthening national capacity and drawing attention to the full range of\njustice mechanisms to be considered; (ii) identifying gaps in national\nresponse and encouraging a holistic national approach in addressing conflict-\nrelated sexual violence, including by enhancing criminal accountability,\njudicial capacity and responsiveness to victims (such as reparations\nmechanisms); (iii) making recommendations to coordinate domestic and\ninternational efforts and resources to reinforce governments' ability to\naddress conflict-related sexual violence; and (iv) working with other UN\nmechanisms including UN Missions, Country Teams, and the SRSG-SVC towards the\nfull implementation of resolutions 1820 (2008), 1888 (2009), 1960 (2010), 2106\n(2013) and 2331 (2016).
