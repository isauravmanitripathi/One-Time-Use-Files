        "generated_section_content_md": "International governmental cooperation group\n\nThe **Polynesian Leaders Group (PLG)** is an international governmental\ncooperation group bringing together four independent countries and eight self-\ngoverning territories in Polynesia.\n\nThe idea of a Polynesian regional grouping had been discussed for several\nyears, notably in response to the Melanesian Spearhead Group, a regional\ngrouping for countries in Melanesia. In September 2011, Samoan Prime Minister\nTuilaepa Sa\u2019ilele Malielegaoi initiated a meeting with the leaders of Tonga,\nTuvalu, the Cook Islands and Niue on the margins of the Pacific Islands Forum\nsummit in Auckland. These initial talks led to a second meeting in Apia which,\non 17 November, led to a memorandum of understanding formally establishing the\nPolynesian Leaders Group (PLG).\n\nThe Group does not have a fixed Secretariat at present, despite initial\nsuggestions that one would be established in Apia. The Group held its first\nformal meeting in Rarotonga in the Cook Islands in August 2012."

Fiji and Samoa were also parties to\nthese discussions."

Wallis and Futuna would be the first new member since\nthe Group was founded in 2011.\n\nIn June 2018, the Group voted to add three members: the sovereign state of New\nZealand, the U.S. state of Hawaii, and the Chilean territory of Easter Island\n(Rapa Nui). As far back as September 2011, Niuean Premier Toke Talagi had\nnoted that \"we consider New Zealand and Hawaii, for example, as being part of\nthe Polynesian Triangle so they could very well be part of the members of this\nPolynesian Group\". Tuilaeapa, while also acknowledging that New Zealand was\ngeographically part of Polynesia, said there might be \"complications\" to\ninviting New Zealand into the Group.\n\nWhen the new members were formally announced, the Group's then-chairman, Enele\nSopoaga, prime minister of Tuvalu, said, \"we welcome other Polynesian\ncommunities in other places and locations to join the PLG as brothers,\" and\nemphasized the need for Polynesian communities to come together to address\ncommon problems. Commentators also noted that the addition of New Zealand and\nHawaii could bring additional resources to the Group and increase the\npotential for strategic cooperation with the United States. Further, the\naddition of Easter Island raised questions about the relationship between the\nGroup's interest in decolonization and Easter Island's political status within\nChile."
