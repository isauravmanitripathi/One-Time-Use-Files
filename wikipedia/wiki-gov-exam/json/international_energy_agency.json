The 31 member\ncountries and 13 association countries of the IEA represent 75% of global\nenergy demand.\n\nThe IEA was set up under the framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) in the aftermath of the 1973 oil crisis to\nrespond to physical disruptions in global oil supplies, provide data and\nstatistics about the global oil market and energy sector, promote energy\nsavings and conservation, and establish international technical collaboration.\nSince its founding, the IEA has also coordinated use of the oil reserves that\nits members are required to hold.\n\nBy regularly underestimating the role of renewable energies and overestimating\nthe growth of nuclear energy, the IEA promotes the nuclear industry.\n\nIn subsequent decades, the IEA's role expanded to cover the entire global\nenergy system, encompassing traditional fuels such as gas, and coal as well as\ncleaner and fast-growing energy sources and technologies including renewable\nenergy sources; solar photovoltaics, wind power, biofuels as well as nuclear\npower, and hydrogen, and the critical minerals needed for these technologies.\n\nThe core activity of the IEA is providing policy advice to its member states\nand Associated countries to support their energy security and advance their\ntransition to clean energy. Recently, it has focused in particular on\nsupporting global efforts to accelerate clean energy transition, mitigate\nclimate change, reach net zero emissions, and prevent global temperatures from\nrising above 1.5 \u00b0C. All IEA member countries have signed the Paris Agreement\nwhich aims to limit warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, and two thirds of IEA member\ngovernments have made commitments to emission neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe Embassy of Australia, Paris, where the IEA headquarters are located\n\nThe IEA's executive director is Fatih Birol, who took office in late 2015. IEA\npublishes a range of reports and other information including its flagship\npublication, the annual _World Energy Outlook_ , as well as the _Net Zero by\n2050_ report."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The IEA was founded on November 18, 1974, after the 1973 oil crisis, to avoid\nfuture shocks by helping to ensure reliable energy supplies, promote energy\nefficiency, ensure energy security and encourage technological research and\ninnovation.\n\nThe Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP Agreement) established\nthe mandates and structure of the IEA, chartering it as an autonomous\norganisation under the umbrella of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation\nand Development (OECD). In 1996, the IEA relocated its headquarters from the\nCh\u00e2teau de la Muette, which it shared with the OECD, to commercially leased\nspace located within the Embassy of Australia, Paris.\n\nThe IEA operates autonomously, with its own budget and governance structure.\nThe organization began with 16 founding member countries and has since\nexpanded to 31, with the latest addition being Lithuania in 2022. Full members\nof the IEA must also be members of the OECD and are required to hold 90 days\nworth of oil imports as emergency stocks. These emergency stocks can be\nreleased to stabilize oil markets worldwide and have been activated five\ntimes: January 1991 due to the Gulf War, 2005 after devastation in the Gulf of\nMexico from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, 2011 during the Libyan crisis, and\ntwice in 2022 in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn addition to the emergency release mechanism, the IEA's initial mandates\ninclude reducing dependence on oil, developing alternative energy sources,\nenergy research and development, and collaboration with oil-producing\ncompanies and countries to create a stable energy market. Members are expected\nto draw up plans on demand reduction and efficiency measures that can be\nimplemented during energy emergencies.\n\nIn September 2015, the IEA's chief economist Fatih Birol was appointed\nexecutive director, the first time an official from within the organization\nwas picked to lead it. They have a mandate to modernize the agency on three\nmajor pillars: broadening the IEA's mandate on energy security beyond oil to\ninclude natural gas and electricity; increasing engagement in emerging\neconomies through new Association partnerships; and expanding the IEA's core\nfocus on clean energy technology and energy efficiency. That December, the\nParis Agreement was adopted at the United Nations Climate Change Conference\n(COP21) and the Agency transitioned into direct advocacy for the shipping\nindustry to adopt greener alternatives to hydrocarbon fuels.\n\nIEA chief Fatih Birol called on policymakers to do more to speed up the energy\ntransition and reduce emissions.\n\nThe new category of \"Association countries\" was created in 2015, allowing\ncountries that do not fit the criteria for IEA membership to become affiliated\nwith the organization and participate in its work. China, Indonesia, and\nThailand were the first to join and the IEA now has thirteen Association\ncountries, including Ukraine since July 2022. IEA member and Association\ncountries represent over 75% of global energy consumption.\n\nIn 2021, IEA chief Birol called on policymakers to do more to accelerate the\nclean energy transition and reduce emissions, saying that \"Clean-energy\ntechnologies are slowly but surely going to replace the existing energy\nindustry.\" The following year, Birole was appointed to an unprecedented third\nfour-year leadership term.\n\nAfter the IEA's 2022 Ministerial meeting, a bi-annual high-level meeting of\nIEA countries, member countries once again expanded the organisation's mandate\nto include accelerating the global clean energy transition by \"supporting\ncountries in the global effort to attain net zero greenhouse gas emissions in\nthe energy sector by mid-century.\" The \"IEA 3.0\" mandate also doubles down on\nstrengthening energy security and recognizes the importance of tracking\ncritical minerals and materials to the clean energy transition."

In March 2017, the IEA (along with IRENA) published a report that considers a safer climate scenario than the then-current 450S. This scenario offers improved chances of limiting global warming to less than two degrees, but \u2013 according to research organization Oil Change International \u2013 still falls short of adequately addressing climate science and the decarbonization required to reach agreed upon global climate limits.

        "generated_section_content_md": "Real development of global photovoltaics additions vs. predictions by the IEA,\n2002\u20132016\n\nThe IEA has been criticised for systematically underestimating the role of\nrenewable energy sources in future energy systems such as photovoltaics and\ntheir cost reductions.\n\nIn the past, the IEA has been criticized by environmental groups for\nunderplaying the role of renewable energy technologies in favor of nuclear and\nfossil fuels. In 2009, Guy Pearse stated that the IEA has consistently\nunderestimated the potential for renewable energy alternatives.\n\nThe Energy Watch Group (EWG), a coalition of scientists and politicians which\nanalyses official energy industry predictions, claims that the IEA has had an\ninstitutional bias towards traditional energy sources and has been using\n\"misleading data\" to undermine the case for renewable energy, such as wind and\nsolar. A 2008 EWG report compares IEA projections about the growth of wind\npower capacity and finds that it has consistently underestimated the amount of\nenergy the wind power industry can deliver.\n\nFor example, in 1998, the IEA predicted global wind electricity generation\nwould total 47.4 GW by 2020, but EWG's report states that this level was\nreached by the end of 2004. The report also said that the IEA has not learned\nthe lesson of previous underestimates, and last year net additions of wind\npower globally were four times greater than the average IEA estimate from its\n1995\u20132004 predictions. This pattern seems to have continued through 2016.\n\nIn a press release, the IEA stated that \u201880% of the increase in global\nelectricity generation in 2024 was provided by renewable sources and nuclear\u2019,\nplacing nuclear power production alongside renewable energy sources as if both\nwere being expanded on a grand scale. While it announced that renewables were\nexpanded by 700 GW, it concealed the fact that nuclear power capacity was not\neven expanded by a hundredth of this, namely 6.84 GW. In the document\nannounced with the press release, it states the increase in nuclear power\ncapacity at 7 GW, but conceals the fact that, according to its own figures,\n2.89 GW were lost in the same year due to the shutdown of nuclear power\nplants.\n\nAmid discontent from across the renewables sector at the IEA's performance as\na global energy watchdog, the International Renewable Energy Agency was formed\non January 26, 2009. The aim is to have the agency fully operational by 2010\nwith an initial annual budget of \u20ac25M.\n\nThe IEA forecasts for solar power during the 2010s were criticized as not in\naccordance with the exponential growth in the sector. Authors Adam Whitmore of\nHarvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and Terje\nOsmundsen, then the senior vice president of Scatec Solar, a Norwegian solar\npower company, claimed that the agency's cost assumptions were 100% above\ncurrent market prices, creating misleading projections that perpetuate the\nimpression that the growth of solar power requires huge subsidies, which has\nthe potential to discourage investment in solar energy market and,\nconsequently, stymie faster growth."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Ahead of the launch of the _2009World Energy Outlook_, the British daily\nnewspaper _The Guardian_ , referring to an unidentified senior IEA official,\nalleged that the agency was deliberately downplaying the risk of peak oil\nunder pressures from the US. According to a second unidentified former senior\nIEA official it was \"imperative not to anger the Americans\" and that the world\nhas already entered the \"peak oil zone\".\n\n_The Guardian_ also referred to a team of scientists from Uppsala University\nin Sweden who studied the 2008 World Energy Outlook and concluded the\nforecasts of the IEA were unattainable. According to their peer-reviewed\nreport, oil production in 2030 would not exceed 75 million barrels per day\n(11.9\u00d710~~^~~ 6 m3/d) while the IEA forecasts a production of 105 million\nbarrels per day (16.7\u00d710~~^~~ 6 m3/d). The lead author of the report, Kjell\nAleklett, has claimed that IEA's reports are \"political documents\". Other\nresearch from the same group has thoroughly reviewed oil projections done by\nthe IEA World Energy Outlook.\n\nThe anticorruption NGO Global Witness wrote in its report _Heads in the Sand_\nthat \"Global Witness' analysis demonstrates that the Agency continues to\nretain an overly-optimistic, and therefore misleading, view about potential\nfuture oil production.\" According to Global Witness, \"the Agency's over-\nconfidence, despite credible data, external analysis and underlying\nfundamentals all strongly suggesting a more precautionary approach, has had a\ndisastrous global impact.\"\n\nIn 2023, the IEA predicted that demand for fossil fuels such as oil, natural\ngas and coal would reach an all-time high by 2030. OPEC rejected the IEA's\nforecast, saying \"what makes such predictions so dangerous, is that they are\noften accompanied by calls to stop investing in new oil and gas projects.\" The\nIEA forecasts that ammonia will meet approximately 45% of shipping fuel\ndemands by 2050."

The authors of\nthe Our World in Data open letter suggested that \"countries that fund the IEA\ndrop the requirement to place data behind paywalls and increase their\nfunding\".\n\nIn January 2022, the IEA announced plans to make all its data and analyses\nfreely available and open-access, a move endorsed by its executive director\nand governing board. This initiative was awaiting final endorsement from IEA\nmember countries to become effective.\n\nIn October 2023, the IEA made the World Energy Outlook 2023 dataset available\nfor non-commercial use under a Creative Commons license. This dataset\nencompasses global aggregated data for various scenarios, alongside detailed\nregional and country-specific data up to 2050."

Al-Falih was\nexasperated with those claims, arguing that natural depletion, and strong\ndemand growth meant that there was plenty of room for new supplies, while the\nshale drillers would not crash the market. He further said that the IEA is\noverstating the role of shale in a global market, and how the core job of the\nIEA, is not to take things out of context."
