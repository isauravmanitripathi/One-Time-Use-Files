The success and functionality of the ACS is greatly debated\namong scholars. The main goals of the association are \"to confirm the new\nconcept of the Caribbean Basin by (A) accentuating those interests the\nCaribbean nations hold in common and (B) working to eliminate barriers left\nover from its colonial past.\"\n\nThe organization seeks to use geographic proximity and regional cooperation\n(regionalism) for political and economic advantage with respect to the global\neconomy and trade blocs such as the North American Free Trade Agreement\n(NAFTA), European Union, Arab League, and the South Asian Association for\nRegional Cooperation. The ACS has four distinct areas of interest: Trade,\nTransport, Sustainable Tourism, and Natural Disasters. Each is pursued by a\nSpecial Committee which meets at least twice yearly in order to discuss\ncurrent regional issues and draft treaties.\n\n* The Special Committee on Trade Development and External Economic Relations works in an effort to create larger economic actions in the Caribbean by uniting its member states through integration and cooperation. Through various annual forums the ACS attempts to create economic cooperation in an attempt to benefit and expand the region's economy.\n* The Special Committee on Transport works to promote an Air Transport Agreement amongst the countries which have ratified the agreement. Security of travelers and the policing of airborne crime like drug trafficking also falls under the auspices of the Special Committee on Transport.\n* The Special Committee on Sustainable Tourism aims to promote tourism which is environmentally friendly. The committee promotes the use of sustainable tourism which is healthy for the environment, and at the same time economically beneficial to the Caribbean as a region.\n* The Special Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction which aims to coordinate the prevention and response to natural disasters in the Caribbean. The main focus of this committee is to maintain organisation and attempt to maintain a high level of ability to cope with disasters.\n\nAdditionally there is a Council of National Representatives of the Special\nFund that is in charge of overseeing the resource mobilization and project\ndevelopment of the Association."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The success of the ACS is debated by many scholars on both sides. Those who\nsuggest the ACS is successful would point to the many initiatives the\ndevelopmental coalition has undertaken, as well as its large membership and\nrelations with other international organisations like the European Union.\nThose who suggest it is unsuccessful note how by the end of the 1990s, unlike\nCARICOM, the ACS had failed to establish a track record which was worthy\nenough to allow for the evaluation of the ACS as a developmental coalition.\nFurthermore, some scholars suggest that the ACS is unlikely to become a true\nplayer on the international level. Skeptics often point to other failed\nattempts at economic coalition building like the Central American Common\nMarket (CACM) as an example of the instability of the region. The influence of\nNAFTA on the Caribbean outlines the future struggle of the ACS. The future of\nthe ACS in relation to the western hemisphere is uncertain. \"Despite\ngovernmental statements of commitment to liberalisation, it will be difficult\nfor Caribbean countries to succeed in putting their economies on a firmer\nfooting that would enable them to compete effectively.\""
