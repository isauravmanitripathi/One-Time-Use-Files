The Group\noriginated in a summit meeting of the heads of governments of Bulgaria,\nRomania and Serbia, held on 24 April 2015 in the Romanian city of Craiova. At\nthe group's inaugural meeting, Romania's then-Prime Minister Victor Ponta\nindicated that he was inspired by the Visegr\u00e1d Group. Romania and Bulgaria\nboth joined the European Union in 2007, while Serbia has been in accession\nnegotiations since 2014. Since 2017 meeting in Varna, Bulgaria and the\ninclusion of Greece, meetings have been quadrilateral.\n\nOne of the first initiatives, after a meeting in Vidin, Bulgaria, was to\nstrengthen the telecommunication networks in the border areas of the\ncountries. Other goals include helping Serbia join the European Union and the\nconstruction of a motorway linking Bucharest, Sofia and Belgrade.\n\nOn 2 November 2018, Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov stated that Prime\nMinister of Greece Alexis Tsipras proposed joint bid for the 2030 FIFA World\nCup by Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia and Greece during the meeting in\nThessaloniki."
