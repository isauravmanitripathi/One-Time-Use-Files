        "generated_section_content_md": "International organisation (1920\u20131946)\n\nThe **League of Nations** (**LN** or **LoN** ; French: _Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Nations_\n[s\u0254sjete de n\u0251sj\u0254\u0303], **SdN**) was the first worldwide intergovernmental\norganisation whose principal mission was to maintain world peace. It was\nfounded on 10 January 1920 by the Paris Peace Conference that ended the First\nWorld War. The main organisation ceased operations on 18 April 1946 when many\nof its components were relocated into the new United Nations (UN) which was\ncreated in the aftermath of the Second World War. As the template for modern\nglobal governance, the League profoundly shaped the modern world.\n\nThe League's primary goals were stated in its eponymous Covenant. They\nincluded preventing wars through collective security and disarmament and\nsettling international disputes through negotiation and arbitration. Its other\nconcerns included labour conditions, just treatment of native inhabitants,\nhuman and drug trafficking, the arms trade, global health, prisoners of war,\nand protection of minorities in Europe. The Covenant of the League of Nations\nwas signed on 28 June 1919 as Part I of the Treaty of Versailles, and it\nbecame effective with the rest of the Treaty on 10 January 1920. Australia was\ngranted the right to participate as an autonomous member nation, marking the\nstart of Australian independence on the global stage. The first meeting of the\nCouncil of the League took place on 16 January 1920, and the first meeting of\nthe Assembly of the League took place on 15 November 1920. In 1919, U.S.\npresident Woodrow Wilson won the Nobel Peace Prize for his role as the leading\narchitect of the League.\n\nThe diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift\nfrom the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and\ndepended on the victorious Allied Powers of World War I (Britain, France,\nItaly and Japan were the initial permanent members of the Council) to enforce\nits resolutions, keep to its economic sanctions, or provide an army when\nneeded. The Great Powers were often reluctant to do so. Sanctions could hurt\nLeague members, so they were reluctant to comply with them. During the Second\nItalo-Ethiopian War, when the League accused Italian soldiers of targeting\nInternational Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement medical tents, Benito\nMussolini responded that \"the League is very well when sparrows shout, but no\ngood at all when eagles fall out.\"\n\nAt its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58\nmembers. After some notable successes and some early failures in the 1920s,\nthe League ultimately proved incapable of preventing aggression by the Axis\npowers in the 1930s. Its credibility was weakened because the United States\nnever joined. Japan and Germany left in 1933, Italy left in 1937, and Spain\nleft in 1939. The Soviet Union only joined in 1934 and was expelled in 1939\nafter invading Finland. Furthermore, the League demonstrated an irresolute\napproach to sanction enforcement for fear it might only spark further\nconflict, further decreasing its credibility. One example of this hesitancy\nwas the Abyssinia Crisis, in which Italy's sanctions were only limited from\nthe outset (coal and oil were not restricted), and later altogether abandoned\ndespite Italy being declared the aggressors in the conflict. The onset of the\nSecond World War in 1939 showed that the League had failed its primary\npurpose: to prevent another world war. It was largely inactive until its\nabolition. The League lasted for 26 years; the United Nations effectively\nreplaced it in 1945, inheriting several agencies and organisations founded by\nthe League, with the League itself formally dissolving the following year.\n\nCurrent scholarly consensus views that, even though the League failed to\nachieve its main goal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards\nexpanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of\ncollective security, gave a voice to smaller nations; fostered economic\nstabilisation and financial stability, especially in Central Europe in the\n1920s; helped to raise awareness of problems such as epidemics, slavery, child\nlabour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general working conditions\nthrough its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new\nforms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under\ninternational observation. Professor David Kennedy portrays the League as a\nunique moment when international affairs were \"institutionalised\", as opposed\nto the pre\u2013First World War methods of law and politics."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The 1864 Geneva Convention, one of the earliest formulations of written\ninternational law\n\nThe concept of a peaceful community of nations had been proposed as early as\n1795, when Immanuel Kant's _Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch_ outlined\nthe idea of a league of nations to control conflict and promote peace between\nstates. Kant argued for the establishment of a peaceful world community, not\nin a sense of a global government, but in the hope that each state would\ndeclare itself a free state that respects its citizens and welcomes foreign\nvisitors as fellow rational beings, thus promoting peaceful society worldwide.\nInternational co-operation to promote collective security originated in the\nConcert of Europe that developed after the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century\nin an attempt to maintain the _status quo_ between European states and so\navoid war.\n\nBy 1910, international law developed, with the first Geneva Conventions\nestablishing laws dealing with humanitarian relief during wartime, and the\ninternational Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 governing rules of war and\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes. Theodore Roosevelt at the\nacceptance for his Nobel Prize in 1910, said: \"it would be a masterstroke if\nthose great powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace.\"\n\nOne small forerunner of the League of Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union\n(IPU), was formed by the peace activists William Randal Cremer and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric\nPassy in 1889 (and still exists as an international body focused on the\nworld's various elected legislative bodies). The IPU was founded with an\ninternational scope, with a third of the members of parliaments (in the 24\ncountries that had parliaments) serving as members of the IPU by 1914. Its\nfoundational aims were to encourage governments to solve international\ndisputes by peaceful means. Annual conferences were established to help\ngovernments refine the process of international arbitration. Its structure was\ndesigned as a council headed by a president, which would later be reflected in\nthe structure of the League."

        "generated_section_content_md": "At the start of the First World War, the first schemes for an international\norganisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support,\nparticularly in Great Britain and the United States. Goldsworthy Lowes\nDickinson, a British political scientist, coined the term \"League of Nations\"\nin 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation. Together with Lord Bryce,\nhe played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist\npacifists known as the Bryce Group, later the League of Nations Union. The\ngroup became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure\ngroup within the then-governing Liberal Party. In Dickinson's 1915 pamphlet\n_After the War_ he wrote of his \"League of Peace\" as being essentially an\norganisation for arbitration and conciliation. He felt that the secret\ndiplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war, and thus,\ncould write that, \"the impossibility of war, I believe, would be increased in\nproportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled\nby public opinion.\" The 'Proposals' of the Bryce Group were circulated widely,\nboth in England and the US, where they had a profound influence on the nascent\ninternational movement. In January 1915, a peace conference directed by Jane\nAddams was held in the neutral United States. The delegates adopted a platform\ncalling for creation of international bodies with administrative and\nlegislative powers to develop a \"permanent league of neutral nations\" to work\nfor peace and disarmament. Within months, a call was made for an international\nwomen's conference to be held in The Hague. Coordinated by Mia Boissevain,\nAletta Jacobs and Rosa Manus, the congress, which opened on 28 April 1915 was\nattended by 1,136 participants from neutral nations, and resulted in the\nestablishment of an organisation which would become the Women's International\nLeague for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). At the close of the conference, two\ndelegations of women were dispatched to meet European heads of state over the\nnext several months. They secured agreement from reluctant foreign ministers,\nwho overall felt that such a body would be ineffective, but agreed to\nparticipate in or not impede creation of a neutral mediating body, if other\nnations agreed and if President Woodrow Wilson would initiate a body. In the\nmidst of the War, Wilson refused.\n\nThe League to Enforce Peace published this full-page promotion in _The New\nYork Times_ on Christmas Day 1918. It resolved that the League \"should ensure\npeace by eliminating causes of dissension, by deciding controversies by\npeaceable means, and by uniting the potential force of all the members as a\nstanding menace against any nation that seeks to upset the peace of the\nworld\".\n\nIn 1915, a body similar to the Bryce Group was set up in the United States,\nled by former president William Howard Taft. It was called the League to\nEnforce Peace. It advocated the use of arbitration in conflict resolution and\nthe imposition of sanctions on aggressive countries. None of these early\norganisations envisioned a continuously functioning body; with the exception\nof the Fabian Society in England, they maintained a legalistic approach that\nwould limit the international body to a court of justice. The Fabians were the\nfirst to argue for a \"council\" of states, necessarily the Great Powers, who\nwould adjudicate world affairs, and for the creation of a permanent\nsecretariat to enhance international co-operation across a range of\nactivities.\n\nIn the course of the diplomatic efforts surrounding World War I, both sides\nhad to clarify their long-term war aims. By 1916 in Britain, fighting on the\nside of the Allies, and in the neutral United States, long-range thinkers had\nbegun to design a unified international organisation to prevent future wars.\nHistorian Peter Yearwood argues that when the new coalition government of\nDavid Lloyd George took power in December 1916, there was widespread\ndiscussion among intellectuals and diplomats of the desirability of\nestablishing such an organisation. When Lloyd George was challenged by Wilson\nto state his position with an eye on the postwar situation, he endorsed such\nan organisation. Wilson himself included in his Fourteen Points in January\n1918 a \"league of nations to ensure peace and justice.\" British foreign\nsecretary, Arthur Balfour, argued that, as a condition of durable peace,\n\"behind international law, and behind all treaty arrangements for preventing\nor limiting hostilities, some form of international sanction should be devised\nwhich would give pause to the hardiest aggressor.\"\n\nThe war had had a profound impact, affecting the social, political and\neconomic systems of Europe and inflicting psychological and physical damage.\nSeveral empires collapsed: first the Russian Empire in February 1917, followed\nby the German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and Ottoman Empire. Anti-war\nsentiment rose across the world; the First World War was described as \"the war\nto end all wars\", and its possible causes were vigorously investigated. The\ncauses identified included arms races, alliances, militaristic nationalism,\nsecret diplomacy, and the freedom of sovereign states to enter into war for\ntheir own benefit. One proposed remedy was the creation of an international\norganisation whose aim was to prevent future war through disarmament, open\ndiplomacy, international co-operation, restrictions on the right to wage war,\nand penalties that made war unattractive.\n\nIn London Balfour commissioned the first official report into the matter in\nearly 1918, under the initiative of Lord Robert Cecil. The British committee\nwas finally appointed in February 1918. It was led by Walter Phillimore (and\nbecame known as the Phillimore Committee), but also included Eyre Crowe,\nWilliam Tyrrell, and Cecil Hurst. The recommendations of the so-called\nPhillimore Commission included the establishment of a \"Conference of Allied\nStates\" that would arbitrate disputes and impose sanctions on offending\nstates. The proposals were approved by the British government, and much of the\ncommission's results were later incorporated into the Covenant of the League\nof Nations.\n\nThe French authorities also drafted a much more far-reaching proposal in June\n1918; they advocated annual meetings of a council to settle all disputes, as\nwell as an \"international army\" to enforce its decisions.\n\nOn his December 1918 trip to Europe, Woodrow Wilson gave speeches that\n\"reaffirmed that the making of peace and the creation of a League of Nations\nmust be accomplished as one single objective\".\n\nAmerican President Woodrow Wilson instructed Edward M. House to draft a US\nplan which reflected Wilson's own idealistic views (first articulated in the\nFourteen Points of January 1918), as well as the work of the Phillimore\nCommission. The outcome of House's work and Wilson's own first draft proposed\nthe termination of \"unethical\" state behaviour, including forms of espionage\nand dishonesty. Methods of compulsion against recalcitrant states would\ninclude severe measures, such as \"blockading and closing the frontiers of that\npower to commerce or intercourse with any part of the world and to use any\nforce that may be necessary...\"\n\nThe two principal drafters and architects of the covenant of the League of\nNations were the British politician Lord Robert Cecil and the South African\nstatesman Jan Smuts. Smuts' proposals included the creation of a council of\nthe great powers as permanent members and a non-permanent selection of the\nminor states. He also proposed the creation of a mandate system for captured\ncolonies of the Central Powers during the war. Cecil focused on the\nadministrative side and proposed annual council meetings and quadrennial\nmeetings for the Assembly of all members. He also argued for a large and\npermanent secretariat to carry out the League's administrative duties.\n\nAccording to historian Patricia Clavin, Cecil and the British continued their\nleadership of the development of a rules-based global order into the 1920s and\n1930s, with a primary focus on the League of Nations. The British goal was to\nsystematise and normalise the economic and social relations between states,\nmarkets, and civil society. They gave priority to business and banking issues,\nbut also considered the needs of ordinary women, children and the family as\nwell. They moved beyond high-level intellectual discussions, and set up local\norganisations to support the League. The British were particularly active in\nsetting up junior branches for secondary students.\n\nThe League of Nations was relatively more universal and inclusive in its\nmembership and structure than previous international organisations, but the\norganisation enshrined racial hierarchy by curtailing the right to self-\ndetermination and prevented decolonisation."

After lengthy negotiations between the delegates, the\nHurst\u2013Miller draft was finally produced as a basis for the Covenant. After\nmore negotiation and compromise, the delegates finally approved of the\nproposal to create the League of Nations (French: _Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Nations_ ,\nGerman: _V\u00f6lkerbund_) on 25 January 1919. The final Covenant of the League of\nNations was drafted by a special commission, and the League was established by\nPart I of the Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919.\n\nFrench women's rights advocates invited international feminists to participate\nin a parallel conference to the Paris Conference in hopes that they could gain\npermission to participate in the official conference. The Inter-Allied Women's\nConference asked to be allowed to submit suggestions to the peace negotiations\nand commissions and were granted the right to sit on commissions dealing\nspecifically with women and children. Though they asked for enfranchisement\nand full legal protection under the law equal with men, those rights were\nignored. Women won the right to serve in all capacities, including as staff or\ndelegates in the League of Nations organisation. They also won a declaration\nthat member nations should prevent trafficking of women and children and\nshould equally support humane conditions for children, women and men\nlabourers. At the Z\u00fcrich Peace Conference held between 17 and 19 May 1919, the\nwomen of the WILPF condemned the terms of the Treaty of Versailles for both\nits punitive measures, as well as its failure to provide for condemnation of\nviolence and exclusion of women from civil and political participation. Upon\nreading the Rules of Procedure for the League of Nations, Catherine Marshall,\na British suffragist, discovered that the guidelines were completely\nundemocratic and they were modified based on her suggestion.\n\nThe League would be made up of a Assembly (representing all member states), a\nCouncil (with membership limited to major powers), and a permanent\nSecretariat. Member states were expected to \"respect and preserve as against\nexternal aggression\" the territorial integrity of other members and to disarm\n\"to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety.\" All states were\nrequired to submit complaints for arbitration or judicial inquiry before going\nto war. The Council would create a Permanent Court of International Justice to\nmake judgements on the disputes.\n\nDespite Wilson's efforts to establish and promote the League, for which he was\nawarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October 1919, the United States never joined.\nSenate Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge wanted a League with the\nreservation that only Congress could take the U.S. into war. Lodge gained a\nmajority of Senators and Wilson refused to allow a compromise. The Senate\nvoted on the ratification on 19 March 1920, and the 49\u201335 vote fell short of\nthe needed 2/3 majority.\n\nThe League held its first council meeting in Paris on 16 January 1920, six\ndays after the Versailles Treaty and the Covenant of the League of Nations\ncame into force. On 1 November 1920, the headquarters of the League was moved\nfrom London to Geneva, where the first General Assembly was held on 15\nNovember 1920. Geneva made sense as an ideal city for the League, since\nSwitzerland had been a neutral country for centuries and was already the\nheadquarters for the International Red Cross. Its strong democracy and\nlocation in central Europe made it a good choice for the nations of the world.\nSupport for Geneva as the selection came from Swiss Federal Councillor Gustave\nAdor and economist William Rappard. The Palais Wilson on Geneva's western\nlakeshore, named after Woodrow Wilson, was the League's first permanent home."

Each organ's\nbudget was allocated by the Assembly (the League was supported financially by\nits member states).\n\nThe relations between the assembly and the council and the competencies of\neach were for the most part not explicitly defined. Each body could deal with\nany matter within the sphere of competence of the league or affecting peace in\nthe world. Particular questions or tasks might be referred to either.\n\nUnanimity was required for the decisions of both the assembly and the council,\nexcept in matters of procedure and some other specific cases such as the\nadmission of new members. This requirement was a reflection of the league's\nbelief in the sovereignty of its component nations; the league sought a\nsolution by consent, not by dictation. In case of a dispute, the consent of\nthe parties to the dispute was not required for unanimity.\n\nThe Permanent Secretariat, established at the seat of the League at Geneva,\ncomprised a body of experts in various spheres under the direction of the\ngeneral secretary. Its principal sections were Political, Financial and\nEconomics, Transit, Minorities and Administration (administering the Saar and\nDanzig), Mandates, Disarmament, Health, Social (Opium and Traffic in Women and\nChildren), Intellectual Cooperation and International Bureaux, Legal, and\nInformation. The staff of the Secretariat was responsible for preparing the\nagenda for the Council and the Assembly and publishing reports of the meetings\nand other routine matters, effectively acting as the League's civil service.\nIn 1931 the staff numbered 707.\n\nA session of the Assembly (1923), meeting in Geneva at the _Salle de la\nR\u00e9formation_ (in a building at the corner of _Boulevard Helv\u00e9tique_ and _Rue\ndu Rh\u00f4ne_) from 1920 to 1929, and at the _B\u00e2timent \u00e9lectoral_ or _Palais\n\u00c9lectoral_ (_Rue du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral- Dufour_ 24) from 1930 to 1936 as well as for\nspecial sessions at the _Palais du d\u00e9sarmement_ adjacent to the Palais Wilson,\nbefore moving into the _Assembly Hall_ of the Palace of Nations.\n\nThe Assembly consisted of representatives of all members of the League, with\neach state allowed up to three representatives and one vote. It met in Geneva\nand, after its initial sessions in 1920, it convened once a year in September.\nThe special functions of the Assembly included the admission of new members,\nthe periodical election of non-permanent members to the council, the election\nwith the Council of the judges of the Permanent Court, and control of the\nbudget. In practice, the Assembly was the general directing force of League\nactivities.\n\nThe Council acted as a type of executive body directing the Assembly's\nbusiness. It began with four permanent members \u2013 Great Britain, France, Italy,\nand Japan \u2013 and four non-permanent members that were elected by the Assembly\nfor a three-year term. The first non-permanent members were Belgium, Brazil,\nGreece, and Spain.\n\nThe composition of the Council was changed several times. The number of non-\npermanent members was first increased to six on 22 September 1922 and to nine\non 8 September 1926. Werner Dankwort of Germany pushed for his country to join\nthe League; joining in 1926, Germany became the fifth permanent member of the\nCouncil. Later, after Germany and Japan both left the League, the number of\nnon-permanent seats was increased from nine to eleven, and the Soviet Union\nwas made a permanent member giving the council a total of fifteen members. The\nCouncil met, on average, five times a year and in extraordinary sessions when\nrequired. In total, 107 sessions were held between 1920 and 1939."

Albert Thomas was\nits first director.\n\nChild labour in Kamerun in 1919\n\nThe ILO successfully restricted the addition of lead to paint, and convinced\nseveral countries to adopt an eight-hour work day and forty-eight-hour working\nweek. It also campaigned to end child labour, increase the rights of women in\nthe workplace, and make shipowners liable for accidents involving seamen.\nAfter the demise of the League, the ILO became an agency of the United Nations\nin 1946.\n\nThe League's Health Organisation had three bodies: the Health Bureau,\ncontaining permanent officials of the League; the General Advisory Council or\nConference, an executive section consisting of medical experts; and the Health\nCommittee. In practice, the Paris-based Office international d'hygi\u00e8ne\npublique (OIHP) founded in 1907 after the International Sanitary Conferences,\nwas discharging most of the practical health-related questions, and its\nrelations with the League's Health Committee were often conflictual. The\nHealth Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee the operation of\nthe League's health work, and prepare work to be presented to the council.\nThis body focused on ending leprosy, malaria, and yellow fever, the latter two\nby starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health\nOrganisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union\nto prevent typhus epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.\n\nLinked with health, but also commercial concerns, was the topic of narcotics\ncontrol. Introduced by the Second International Opium Convention, the\nPermanent Central Opium Board had to supervise the statistical reports on\ntrade in opium, morphine, cocaine and heroin. The board also established a\nsystem of import certificates and export authorisations for the legal\ninternational trade in narcotics.\n\nThe League of Nations had devoted serious attention to the question of\ninternational intellectual cooperation since its creation. The First Assembly\nin December 1920 recommended that the Council take action aiming at the\ninternational organisation of intellectual work, which it did by adopting a\nreport presented by the Fifth Committee of the Second Assembly and inviting a\ncommittee on intellectual co-operation to meet in Geneva in August 1922. The\nFrench philosopher Henri Bergson became the first chairman of the committee.\nThe work of the committee included: an inquiry into the conditions of\nintellectual life, assistance to countries where intellectual life was\nendangered, creation of national committees for intellectual cooperation,\ncooperation with international intellectual organisations, protection of\nintellectual property, inter-university co-operation, co-ordination of\nbibliographical work and international interchange of publications, and\ninternational co-operation in archaeological research.\n\nThe Slavery Commission sought to eradicate slavery and slave trading across\nthe world, and fought forced prostitution. Its main success was through\npressing the governments who administered mandated countries to end slavery in\nthose countries. The League secured a commitment from Ethiopia to end slavery\nas a condition of membership in 1923, and worked with Liberia to abolish\nforced labour and intertribal slavery. The United Kingdom had not supported\nEthiopian membership of the League on the grounds that \"Ethiopia had not\nreached a state of civilisation and internal security sufficient to warrant\nher admission.\"\n\nThe League also succeeded in reducing the death rate of workers constructing\nthe Tanganyika railway from 55 to 4 per cent. Records were kept to control\nslavery, prostitution, and the trafficking of women and children. Partly as a\nresult of pressure brought by the League of Nations, Afghanistan abolished\nslavery in 1923, Iraq in 1924, Nepal in 1926, Transjordan and Persia in 1929,\nBahrain in 1937, and Ethiopia in 1942.\n\nA sample Nansen passport\n\nLed by Fridtjof Nansen, the Commission for Refugees was established on 27 June\n1921 to look after the interests of refugees, including overseeing their\nrepatriation and, when necessary, resettlement. At the end of the First World\nWar, there were two to three million ex-prisoners of war from various nations\ndispersed throughout Russia; within two years of the commission's foundation,\nit had helped 425,000 of them return home. It established camps in Turkey in\n1922 to aid the country with an ongoing refugee crisis, helping to prevent the\nspread of cholera, smallpox and dysentery as well as feeding the refugees in\nthe camps. It also established the Nansen passport as a means of\nidentification for stateless people.\n\nThe Committee for the Study of the Legal Status of Women sought to inquire\ninto the status of women all over the world. It was formed in 1937, and later\nbecame part of the United Nations as the Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nThe Covenant of the League said little about economics. Nonetheless, in 1920\nthe Council of the League called for a financial conference. The First\nAssembly at Geneva provided for the appointment of an Economic and Financial\nAdvisory Committee to provide information to the conference. In 1923, a\npermanent Economic and Financial Organisation came into being. The existing\nbilateral treaty regime was integrated into the League where the most-\nfavoured-nation norm was codified and the League took on responsibilities\nrelated to international oversight and standardisation."

This proposal conflicted with Britain's interests\nat the time, as it sought to maintain dominance in the Middle East, protect\nits oil and trade routes, and limit French influence in the region.\n\nThe Paris Peace Conference compromised with Wilson by adopting the principle\nthat these territories should be administered by different governments on\nbehalf of the League \u2013 a system of national responsibility subject to\ninternational supervision. This plan, defined as the mandate system, was\nadopted by the \"Council of Ten\" (the heads of government and foreign ministers\nof the main Allied Powers: Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and\nJapan) on 30 January 1919 and transmitted to the League of Nations.\n\nLeague of Nations mandates were established under Article 22 of the Covenant\nof the League of Nations.

This change can be seen in\nthe relationship between the League and non-members. The United States and the\nSoviet Union, for example, increasingly worked with the League. During the\nsecond half of the 1920s, France, Britain and Germany were all using the\nLeague of Nations as the focus of their diplomatic activity, and each of their\nforeign secretaries attended League meetings at Geneva during this period.\nThey also used the League's machinery to try to improve relations and settle\ntheir differences."

The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper\nSilesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or\nPoland. Complaints about the attitude of the German authorities led to rioting\nand eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A\nplebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 per cent (around 500,000) of\nthe votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions\nsurrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising\nin 1921.\n\nOn 12 August 1921, the League was asked to settle the matter; the Council\ncreated a commission with representatives from Belgium, Brazil, China and\nSpain to study the situation. The committee recommended that Upper Silesia be\ndivided between Poland and Germany according to the preferences shown in the\nplebiscite and that the two sides should decide the details of the interaction\nbetween the two areas \u2013 for example, whether goods should pass freely over the\nborder due to the economic and industrial interdependence of the two areas. In\nNovember 1921, a conference was held in Geneva to negotiate a convention\nbetween Germany and Poland. A final settlement was reached, after five\nmeetings, in which most of the area was given to Germany, but with the Polish\nsection containing the majority of the region's mineral resources and much of\nits industry. When this agreement became public in May 1922, bitter resentment\nwas expressed in Germany, but the treaty was still ratified by both countries.\nThe settlement produced peace in the area until the beginning of the Second\nWorld War."

The League sent\na commission of representatives from various powers to the region. In November\n1921, the League decided that the frontiers of Albania should be the same as\nthey had been in 1913, with three minor changes that favoured Yugoslavia.\nYugoslav forces withdrew a few weeks later, albeit under protest.\n\nThe borders of Albania again became the cause of international conflict when\nItalian General Enrico Tellini and four of his assistants were ambushed and\nkilled on 27 August 1923 while marking out the newly decided border between\nGreece and Albania.

The report passed 42\u20131 in the Assembly in 1933 (only Japan\nvoting against), but instead of removing its troops from China, Japan withdrew\nfrom the League. In the end, as British historian Charles Mowat argued,\ncollective security was dead:\n\nThe League and the ideas of collective security and the rule of law were defeated; partly because of indifference and of sympathy with the aggressor, but partly because the League powers were unprepared, preoccupied with other matters, and too slow to perceive the scale of Japanese ambitions."

Although the region was sparsely populated, it\ncontained the Paraguay River, which would have given either landlocked country\naccess to the Atlantic Ocean, and there was also speculation, later proved\nincorrect, that the Chaco would be a rich source of petroleum. Border\nskirmishes throughout the late 1920s culminated in an all-out war in 1932 when\nthe Bolivian army attacked the Paraguayans at Fort Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez at\nLake Pitiantuta. The war was a disaster for both sides, causing 57,000\ncasualties for Bolivia, whose population was around three million, and 36,000\ndead for Paraguay, whose population was approximately one million. It also\nbrought both countries to the brink of economic disaster. By the time a\nceasefire was negotiated on 12 June 1935, Paraguay had seized control of most\nof the region, as was later recognised by the 1938 truce.\n\nInitially, both sides refused to allow the League to conduct an inquiry until\nNovember 1933, over a year after the start of the war. As a result, the League\ndid not formally invoke Article 16 to apply sanctions. The Pan-American\nConference offered to mediate and the League deferred to the conference, but\nthe warring sides ignored the conference. Eventually (without going through\nArticle 16), an arms embargo was enacted by several members of the League\n(plus non-League members the United States and Brazil), but several\nneighbouring states ignored the embargo rendering it ineffective. In November\n1934, the League demanded that both sides withdraw and undergo arbitration.\nBolivia accepted, but Paraguay by then had taken control of all of the\ndisputed area. Paraguay rejected arbitration and quit the League."

The modern Italian Army defeated\nthe poorly armed Abyssinians and captured Addis Ababa in May 1936, forcing\nEmperor of Ethiopia Haile Selassie to flee to exile in England.\n\nThe League of Nations condemned Italy's aggression and imposed economic\nsanctions in November 1935, but the sanctions were largely ineffective since\nthey did not ban the sale of oil or close the Suez Canal (controlled by\nBritain). As Stanley Baldwin, the British Prime Minister, later observed, this\nwas ultimately because no one had the military forces on hand to withstand an\nItalian attack. In October 1935, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked\nthe recently passed Neutrality Acts and placed an embargo on arms and\nmunitions to both sides, but extended a further \"moral embargo\" to the\nbelligerent Italians, including other trade items. On 5 October and later on\n29 February 1936, the United States endeavoured, with limited success, to\nlimit its exports of oil and other materials to normal peacetime levels. The\nLeague sanctions were lifted on 4 July 1936, but by that point, Italy had\nalready gained control of the urban areas of Abyssinia.\n\nThe Hoare\u2013Laval Pact of December 1935 was an attempt by the British Foreign\nSecretary Samuel Hoare and the French Prime Minister Pierre Laval to end the\nconflict in Abyssinia by proposing to partition the country into an Italian\nsector and an Abyssinian sector. Mussolini was prepared to agree to the pact,\nbut news of the deal leaked out. Both the British and French public vehemently\nprotested against it, describing it as a sell-out of Abyssinia. Hoare and\nLaval were forced to resign, and the British and French governments\ndissociated themselves from the two men. In June 1936, although there was no\nprecedent for a head of state addressing the Assembly of the League of Nations\nin person, Haile Selassie spoke to the Assembly, appealing for its help in\nprotecting his country.\n\nThe Abyssinian crisis showed how the League could be influenced by the self-\ninterest of its members; one of the reasons why the sanctions were not very\nharsh was that both Britain and France feared the prospect of driving\nMussolini and Adolf Hitler into an alliance."

Fear of attack increased as Germany regained its\nstrength after the First World War, especially after Adolf Hitler gained power\nand became German Chancellor in 1933.

Though it was intended to\nencompass all nations, many never joined, or their period of membership was\nshort. The most conspicuous absentee was the United States. President Woodrow\nWilson had been a driving force behind the League's formation and strongly\ninfluenced the form it took, but the US Senate voted not to join on 19\nNovember 1919. Ruth Henig has suggested that, had the United States become a\nmember, it would have also provided support to France and Britain, possibly\nmaking France feel more secure, and so encouraging France and Britain to co-\noperate more fully regarding Germany, thus making the rise to power of the\nNazi Party less likely. Conversely, Henig acknowledges that if the US had been\na member, its reluctance to engage in war with European states or to enact\neconomic sanctions might have hampered the ability of the League to deal with\ninternational incidents. The structure of the US federal government might also\nhave made its membership problematic, as its representatives at the League\nwould only be able to answer on behalf of the executive branch, certain League\ndecisions such as to go to war, would always require prior approval of the\nlegislative branch regardless of the outcome of any floor vote even.\n\nIn January 1920, when the League was born, Germany was not permitted to join\nbecause it was seen as having been the aggressor in the First World War.\nSoviet Russia was also initially excluded because Communist regimes were not\nwelcomed and membership would have been initially dubious due to the ongoing\nRussian Civil War in which both sides claimed to be the legitimate government\nof the country. The League was further weakened when major powers left in the\n1930s. Japan began as a permanent member of the Council since the country was\nan Allied Power in the First World War but withdrew in 1933 after the League\nvoiced opposition to its occupation of Manchuria. Italy also began as a\npermanent member of the council. However the League staunchly opposed Italy's\ninvasion of Ethiopia in 1934. When the war ended in an Italian conquest, the\nLeague refused to recognise Italian sovereignty over Ethiopia, prompting the\nItalian-Fascist government to withdraw from the organisation altogether in\n1937. Though neutral during World War I, Spain (then still a kingdom) also\nbegan as a permanent member of the council, but withdrew in 1939 after the\nSpanish Civil War ended in a victory for the Nationalists. Though world\nopinion was much more divided over the Spanish Civil War than the conflicts\ninvolving Japan and Italy, the general perception leaned in favour of the\nRepublican cause. The League had accepted Germany, also as a permanent member\nof the council, in 1926, deeming it to have become a \"peace-loving country\"\nunder the Weimar Republic. After the Nazis came to power in 1933, Adolf Hitler\nwithdrew Germany almost immediately."

The League's collective security system\nrequired nations to act, if necessary, against states they considered\nfriendly, and in a way that might endanger their national interests, to\nsupport states for which they had no normal affinity. This weakness was\nexposed during the Abyssinia Crisis, when Britain and France had to balance\nmaintaining the security they had attempted to create for themselves in Europe\n\"to defend against the enemies of internal order\", in which Italy's support\nplayed a pivotal role, with their obligations to Abyssinia as a member of the\nLeague.\n\nOn 23 June 1936, in the wake of the collapse of League efforts to restrain\nItaly's war against Abyssinia, the British Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin,\ntold the House of Commons that collective security had\n\n> failed ultimately because of the reluctance of nearly all the nations in\n> Europe to proceed to what I might call military sanctions ...

That is a terrible thing, but\n> it is an essential part of collective security.\n\nUltimately, Britain and France both abandoned the concept of collective\nsecurity in favour of appeasement in the face of growing German militarism\nunder Hitler. In this context, the League of Nations was also the institution\nwhere the first international debate on terrorism took place following the\n1934 assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseille, France.\nThis debate established precedents regarding global surveillance (in the form\nof routine international sharing of surveillance data), the punishment of\nterrorists as an international (rather than national) matter, and the right of\na nation to conduct military attacks within another nation as a response to\ninternational terrorism. Many of these concepts are detectable in the\ndiscourse of terrorism among states after 9/11.\n\nAmerican diplomatic historian Samuel Flagg Bemis originally supported the\nLeague, but after two decades changed his mind:\n\n> The League of Nations has been a disappointing failure.... It has been a\n> failure, not because the United States did not join it; but because the\n> great powers have been unwilling to apply sanctions except where it suited\n> their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on\n> which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed\n> over half the world."

The Convention encouraged friendly radio\nbroadcasts to other nations. It called for League prohibitions on\ninternational broadcasts containing hostile speech and false claims.

The\narchive of the League of Nations was transferred to the United Nations Office\nat Geneva and is now an entry in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register.\n\nIn the Assembly's last session in 1946, Philip Noel-Baker (representing the\nUnited Kingdom) remarked that failure to act as soon as a great power had\ninvaded another state had ultimately doomed the League: \"We know the World War\nbegan in Manchuria 15 years ago...Manchuria, Abyssinia, Munich have killed\nanother great illusion, the belief that appeasement, seeking the national\ninterest at the expense of others, individual action, secret bargains, could\nbring us peace.\"\n\nIn the past few decades, by research using the League Archives at Geneva,\nhistorians have reviewed the legacy of the League of Nations as the United\nNations has faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. Current\nconsensus views that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate\ngoal of world peace, it did manage to build new roads towards expanding the\nrule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security,\ngiving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like\nepidemics, slavery, child labour, colonial tyranny, refugee crises and general\nworking conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved\nthe way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial\npowers under international observation. Erez Manela situated the League as a\ncatalyst for transforming the postwar global order into one critical of the\narrangements of empire. Alternatively, Laura Robson & Joe Maiolo posit the\nargument that the Mandate System under the League was a re-vitalised form of\nimperialism that placed former colonies under the ownership of greater powers.\n\nProfessor David Kennedy portrays the League as a unique moment when\ninternational affairs were \"institutionalised\", as opposed to the pre\u2013First\nWorld War methods of law and politics.\n\nThe principal Allies in the Second World War (the UK, the USSR, France, the\nU.S., and the Republic of China) became permanent members of the United\nNations Security Council in 1946; in 1971, the People's Republic of China\nreplaced the Republic of China (then only in control of Taiwan) as a permanent\nmember of the UN Security Council, and in 1991, the Russian Federation assumed\nthe seat of the dissolved USSR. Decisions of the Security Council are binding\non all members of the UN, and unanimous decisions are not required, unlike in\nthe League Council. Only the five permanent members of the Security Council\ncan wield a veto to protect their vital interests."
