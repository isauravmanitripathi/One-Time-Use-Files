Initially, the incoming host,\noutgoing host and future host constituted a hosting trio to coordinate\norganising summits and the setting agendas. This was expanded to a quartet\nfollowing the fourth summit in July 2024.\n\nIn January 2023, the Government of France began recruiting a small task force,\nled by a project manager, to support the work of the EPC. The task force will\nhelp coordinate the preparation and organisation of EPC Summits, support the\ninstitutional development of the EPC, facilitate the insertion of the EPC in\nthe space European diplomacy (EU, Council of Europe) and contribute to\nmobilising various other actors (such as development banks) in support of the\nwork of the EPC.\n\nThe invitation letter for the first summit was signed by European Council\nPresident Charles Michel. For the second summit, invitation letters were\njointly signed by Charles Michel and Maia Sandu, the president of the hosting\ncountry.\n\nAs the community has not launched an official website, the agendas, press\nreleases and multimedia resources for the summits are published on the website\nof the European Council."
