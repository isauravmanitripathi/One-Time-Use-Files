At\nthe 39th Meeting the critical issue of the relationship between the OECS\npassport and the CARICOM passport was discussed and at the 40th OECS Authority\nMeeting in November 2004, the OECS Heads of Government agreed to give CARICOM\na further 6 months (until May 2005) to introduce a CARICOM Passport. Failure\nto introduce the CARICOM Passport by that time would have resulted in the OECS\nmoving ahead with its plans to introduce the OECS Passport. As the CARICOM\nPassport was first introduced in January 2005 (by Suriname) then the idea of\nthe OECS Passport was abandoned. Had the passport been introduced however it\nwould not have been issued to Economic Citizens within the OECS states.\n\nIt would also be unknown if the islands under British sovereignty would join\nthe scheme."

The remaining two member\nstates, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands, would not have participated\nimmediately, but would have requested time to consider the issue further. In\n2003, work had been initiated on the central issue of the creation of new\nTreaty arrangements to replace the Treaty of Basseterre which established the\nOECS. Among the elements of the project was the creation of a technical\ncommittee for a draft OECS Economic Union Treaty. This technical committee was\ninaugurated on 4 May 2004 and began designing the draft Treaty."

Although some of the provisions would seem to duplicate efforts by\nthe CSME, the Declaration of Intent and statements by some OECS leaders,\nacknowledge the CSME and give assurance that the OECS Economic Union would not\nrun counter to CARICOM integration but that it would become seamlessly\nintegrated into the CSME. To this end, the OECS Heads of Government agreed\nthat steps should be taken to ensure that the OECS Economic Union Treaty would\nbe recognised under the Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas, just as the original\nTreaty of Chaguaramas had recognised the Treaty of Basseterre.\n\nThis was achieved in 2013 at the Twenty-Fourth Inter-Sessional Meeting of the\nConference of Heads of Government of CARICOM held in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,\nfrom 18\u201319 February 2013. At that conference CARICOM leaders adopted the OECS\u2019\nRevised Treaty of Basseterre into CARICOM\u2019s Revised Treaty of Chaguaramas,\nwhich St. Vincent and the Grenadines Prime Minister, Ralph Gonsalves said\nwould effectively give CARICOM member states the opportunity of integrating\ninitially with the OECS and taking a seemingly quicker path to integration. In\norder to achieve this the Conference agreed that the Inter-Governmental Task\nForce (IGTF) revising the Treaty of Chaguaramas would recognise the provisions\nof the Treaty establishing the Economic Union of the Organisation of Eastern\nCaribbean States (OECS). The IGTF was mandated to refer back to the Conference\nat its next meeting on this issue.\n\nThe Economic Union Treaty's provisions are now expected to establish a Single\nFinancial and Economic Space within which goods, people and capital move\nfreely; harmonize monetary and fiscal policies Member States are expected\ncontinue to adopt a common approach to trade, health, education and\nenvironment, as well as to the development of such critical sectors as\nagriculture, tourism and energy. The Economic Union Treaty (or Revised Treaty\nas it is sometimes known) will also create two new organs for governing the\nOCES; The Regional Assembly (consisting of members of\nparliaments/legislatures) and The Commission (a strengthened Secretariat). The\nfree movement of OECS nationals within the subregion is expected to commence\nin August 2011 after a commitment towards that goal by the Heads of Government\nat their meeting in May 2011.\n\nThis was achieved on schedule with the six independent OECS members and later\nMontserrat with nationals being allowed to enter the participating Member\nStates without hindrance and remain for an indefinite period in order to work,\nestablish businesses; provide services or to reside. The free movement of OECS\nnationals throughout the Economic Union is underpinned by legislation and is\nfacilitated by administrative mechanisms This is achieved by OECS nationals\nentering the special immigration lines for CARICOM nationals when traveling\nthroughout the Economic Union and presenting a valid photo ID and completed\nEntry/Departure form whereupon the immigration officer shall grant the\nnational entry for an indefinite period save where the national presents a\nsecurity risk or where there exists some other legal basis for prohibiting\nentry."

In 2001, Saba, an island of\nthe Netherlands Antilles, decided to seek membership in the OECS. Saba's\nIsland Council had passed a motion on 30 May 2001 calling for Saba's\nmembership in the organisation and subsequently on 7 June 2001, the Executive\nCouncil of Saba decided in favour of membership. Saba's senator in the\nNetherlands Antilles parliament was then asked to present a motion requesting\nthe Antillean parliament to support Saba's quest for membership. In addition\nto the support from the Antillean parliament, Saba also required a\ndispensation from the government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become\nan associate member of the OECS. Saba's bid for membership was reportedly\nsupported by St. Kitts and Nevis and discussed at the 34th meeting of OECS\nleaders in Dominica in July. Also in 2001, Sint Maarten, another part of the\nNetherlands Antilles, explored the possibility of joining the OECS. After\nlearning of Saba's intentions to join, St. Maarten suggested exploring ways in\nwhich Saba and St. Maarten could support each other in their pursuit of\nmembership.\n\nNone of the prospective members have become associate members as yet, but\nSaba, St. Eustatius and St. Maarten do participate in the meetings of the\nCouncil of Tourism Ministers (as the Forum of Tourism Ministers of the Eastern\nCaribbean, along with representatives of Saint-Martin, Saint Barth\u00e9lemy,\nMartinique and Guadeloupe)."
