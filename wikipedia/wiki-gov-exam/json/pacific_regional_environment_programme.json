SPREP Members meet once every year to discuss the workplan and\nbudget and other matters relating to administration and corporate affairs. The\n25th SPREP Meeting was held in the Republic of the Marshall Islands in October\n2014.\n\nSPREP began life in the late 1970s as a joint initiative of SPC, SPEC, ESCAP\nand UNEP - eventually functioning as a component of UNEP's Regional Seas\nProgramme. The Programme received further impetus as a result of the 1982\nConference on the Human Environment in the South Pacific. Following a period\nof expansion and long deliberations, SPREP left SPC in Noum\u00e9a in 1992 and\nrelocated to Samoa. It achieved autonomy as an independent inter-governmental\norganisation with the signing of the Agreement Establishing SPREP in Apia on\n16 June 1993.\n\nSPREP (the Secretariat) is the region\u2019s key inter-governmental organisation\nfor environment and sustainable development, and is one of several inter-\ngovernmental agencies comprising the Council of Regional Organisations in the\nPacific (CROP). Under the Agreement Establishing SPREP, the purposes of SPREP\nare to promote cooperation in the South Pacific Region and to provide\nassistance in order to protect and improve the environment and to ensure\nsustainable development for present and future generations (Art.2). SPREP's\nvision is: the Pacific environment - sustaining our livelihoods and natural\nheritage in harmony with our cultures. SPREP also functions as the Secretariat\nof 2 (formerly 3) regional conventions: the Noum\u00e9a Convention, the Waigani\nConvention and the Apia Convention (suspended)."
