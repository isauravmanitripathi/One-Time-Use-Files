These countries and in fact most of the\ndeveloping countries require fiscal and monetary space to maintain momentum on\nprogress to lay the foundation for a diversified and sustainable economic\ngrowth.\n\nThe group asked for exploring avenues for enhancing cooperation among member\nstates to shape their future development needs and strategies as well as\ngreater cooperation with international partners for market access, enhanced\nproductive capacities and development of scientific and technological skills\nand converting debts to financing aid projects.\n\nG11 countries need targeted assistance and support from the developed\ncountries to accelerate growth, lift millions from poverty and hasten the\ndelivery of the fruits of reforms and social development to larger segments of\ntheir population. The G11 group need to enter into political dialogue with the\nG8 countries for their support to meet development objectives, encourage\ninvestment and have greater market access.\n\nOutstanding Debt on the developing countries places a great burden on export\nearnings and fiscal revenues. Moreover, tariffs imposed by the G8 and other\ndeveloped countries on imports are the major hurdles in the way of improving\nthe living standard of the peoples of the developing and under developed\ncountries through export led growth."
