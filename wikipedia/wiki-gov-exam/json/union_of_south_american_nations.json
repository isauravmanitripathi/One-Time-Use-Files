On 13 March 2019, Ecuador announced that it would withdraw\nfrom the organization. The president of the country, Lenin Moreno, also asked\nthe bloc to return the headquarters building of the organization, based in\nQuito. On 10 March 2020, Uruguay officially announced its withdrawal from the\norganization. Brazil rejoined on 5 May 2023.\n\nIn January 2019, amid growing concern about Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a new\ngroup, PROSUL/PROSUR, was advanced to counteract the influence of what\ncountries in the region call a dictatorship in Venezuela. A Chilean summit to\norganize PROSUL was held on 22 March 2019, and excluded Venezuela. Argentina,\nBrazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Guyana and\nSuriname were invited to join the new regional bloc."

A notable early\nexponent of this trend was Francisco de Miranda, who envisioned a federated\nrepublic encompassing all of Hispanic America, which he called \"Colombia\".\n\nThe independence war efforts saw the concurrence of integrated armies composed\nby Spanish Americans of diverse regions on both sides of the conflict (v.g.\nPatriots and Royalists), and fighting all over the territories of many future\nnations. For example, the Army of the Andes which was gathered in the United\nProvinces of the River Plate fought in Chile, Peru and Ecuador, and later\nintegrated with Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar's Army (which itself included troops of future\nVenezuela, Colombia and Ecuador) to further fight in Peru and the Upper Peru.\n\nBy the 1820s, the main proponent of a federation of the newly born republics\nwas Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, although this idea was shared by many notable\ncontemporaries, including Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn and Bernardo de Monteagudo, under\neither republican or constitutional monarchical governments. In 1826, Bol\u00edvar\nsummoned a conference to be held in Panama, which was to be known as the\n\"Amphictyonic\" Congress of Panama because of the parallelism with the Hellenic\nAmphictyonic League. The Congress was attended by Gran Colombia (including\npresent-day Colombia, Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador), the Federal Republic of\nCentral America (including present-day Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador,\nHonduras and Guatemala), the United Mexican States, and Peru. The ostensible\nintention was to form a defensive league that could prevent foreign\nexpansionism and foster the interests of the Spanish American republics. The\nCongress' conclusions, however, were not ratified by the participants, except\nfor Gran Colombia. Soon after, both Gran Colombia and the United Provinces of\nCentral America fell apart and the whole of Hispanic America was balkanized by\ncompeting national governments.\n\nBy the 1990s, however, Brazil had consolidated as the most powerful country in\nSouth America (accounting for half of the regional GDP) and began to promote\nthe notion of a united South America (a new regional framing) where Bras\u00edlia\nwould be pivotal. The project did not take hold until the United States'\nforeign policy priorities turned to other regions in the 2000s."
