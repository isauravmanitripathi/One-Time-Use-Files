It is the\nworld's largest humanitarian organization and the leading provider of school\nmeals. Founded in 1961, WFP is headquartered in Rome and has offices in 87\ncountries. In 2023 it supported over 152 million people, and it is present in\nmore than 120 countries and territories.\n\nIn addition to emergency food relief, WFP offers technical and development\nassistance, such as building capacity for emergency preparedness and response,\nmanaging supply chains and logistics, promoting social safety programs, and\nstrengthening resilience against climate change. It is also a major provider\nof direct cash assistance, and provides passenger services for humanitarian\nworkers through its management of the United Nations Humanitarian Air Service\n(UNHAS).\n\nWFP is an executive member of the United Nations Sustainable Development\nGroup, a consortium of UN entities that aims to fulfil the 17 Sustainable\nDevelopment Goals (SDG), with a priority to achieve SDG 2, \"zero hunger\", by\n2030.\n\nThe World Food Programme was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its\nefforts to provide food assistance in areas of conflict and to prevent the use\nof food as a weapon of war and conflict."

WFP\nlaunched its first programmes in 1963 by the FAO and the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly on a three-year experimental basis, supporting the Nubian\npopulation at Wadi Halfa in Sudan. In 1965, the programme was extended to a\ncontinuing basis."

In\n2022, funding reached a record USD 14.1 billion\u2014up by almost 50 percent from\n2021\u2014against an operational funding need of USD 21.4 billion. The United\nStates was the largest donor.\n\nIn 2023, the WFP received USD 8.3 billion in funding, likely marking the first\ntime since 2010 that funding decreased from the previous year, creating a\nfunding gap of 64%.\n\nIn February 2025, the WFP received directives from the U.S. to halt operations\non numerous U.S.-funded grants, despite an emergency waiver issued by\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio intended to allow essential food assistance to\ncontinue. These grants, managed by the U.S. Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), are valued at tens of millions of dollars and are\ninstrumental in providing food aid to countries such as Yemen, the Democratic\nRepublic of Congo, Sudan, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Haiti,\nand Mali. The suspension encompasses several projects under the Food for Peace\nTitle II program, which annually allocates approximately $2 billion for the\ndonation of U.S. commodities and constitutes a significant portion of U.S.\ninternational food assistance. This program is jointly administered by the\nU.S. Department of Agriculture and USAID."

Over 60% of the people facing hunger globally live in regions\nexperiencing armed violence, which compounds with increased displacement,\ndestruction of food systems, and increased humanitarian access challenges to\npose massive risks to food security in the regions. In 2023, more than 300\nmillion people faced acute hunger globally. WFP said it had \"reached 152\nmillion people with essential aid\" in 2023.\n\nThe latest Hunger Hotspots outlook released June 2024 and co-published by WFP\nand FAO, emphasised that \"acute food insecurity is likely to deteriorate\nfurther in 18 hotspots\" between June and October 2024. These countries and\ncountry clusters face famine or risk of famine, with population already in or\nfacing IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe). Of those countries, Haiti, Mali, Palestine,\nSouth Sudan, and Sudan are classified as the most concerning.\n\nWFP is also a first responder to sudden-onset emergencies. When floods struck\nSudan in July 2020, it provided emergency food assistance to nearly 160,000\npeople. WFP provided food as well as vouchers for people to buy vital\nsupplies, while also planning recovery, reconstruction, and resilience-\nbuilding activities, after Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique and floods washed an\nestimated 400,000 hectares of crops on early 2019.\n\nWFP's emergency support is also preemptive in offsetting the potential impact\nof disasters. In the Sahel region of Africa, amidst economic challenges,\nclimate change, and armed militancy, WFP's activities included working with\ncommunities and partners to harvest water for irrigation, restore degraded\nland, and support livelihoods through skills training. It uses early-warning\nsystems to help communities prepare for disasters. In Bangladesh, weather\nforecasting led to the distribution of cash to vulnerable farmers to pay for\nmeasures such as reinforcing their homes or stockpiling food ahead of heavy\nflooding.\n\nThe World Food Program hands off high-energy biscuits to civilians at a\nLiberian port during the Second Civil War.\n\nWFP is the lead agency of the Logistics Cluster, a coordination mechanism\nestablished by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC). It also co-leads\nthe Food Security Cluster. The WFP-managed United Nations Humanitarian Air\nService (UNHAS) serves over 300 destinations globally. WFP also manages the\nUnited Nations Humanitarian Response Depot (UNHRD), a global network of hubs\nthat procure, store and transport emergency supplies for the organization and\nthe wider humanitarian community. WFP logistical support, including its air\nservice and hubs, has enabled staff and supplies from WFP and partner\norganizations to reach areas where commercial flights have not been available\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic."
