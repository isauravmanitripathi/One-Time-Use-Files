        "generated_section_content_md": "The International Organization for Migration (IOM) was founded in 1951 in\nresponse to the large number of internally displaced persons and war refugees\nin Europe after the Second World War. The IOM was initially a logistics agency\nthat organized the transport of nearly one million migrants in the 1950s and\nhas undergone several name changes since its inception. The transition from\nthe Provisional Intergovernmental Committee for the Movement of Migrants from\nEurope (PICMME) in 1951 to the Intergovernmental Committee for European\nMigration (ICEM) in 1952, to the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration\n(ICM) in 1980, and finally to the International Organization for Migration\n(IOM) in 1989 reflects the evolution of the IOM's mandate over its existence,\nbecoming the leading intergovernmental organization in the field of migration."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1992, it was granted observer status at the United Nations General Assembly\n(GA resolution A/RES/47/4). In September 2016, the United Nations (UN) Member\nStates, through the General Assembly, unanimously adopted a resolution\napproving the agreement to transform IOM into an affiliated organization of\nthe UN. This agreement has strengthened the relationship between IOM and the\nUN and improved its ability to fulfill its respective mandates in the\ninterests of migrants and Member States.\n\nThe IOM supported the creation of the Global Compact for Migration, the first-\never intergovernmental agreement on international migration which was adopted\nin Marrakech, Morocco, in December 2018. To support the implementation,\nfollow-up and review of the Global Compact on Migration, the UN Secretary-\nGeneral Ant\u00f3nio Guterres established the UN Network on Migration in 2019. IOM\ncoordinates the United Nations Network on Migration which includes UNHCR, WFP\nand UNDP, among others. While the IOM's history tracks the man-made and\nnatural disasters of the past half century, including Kosovo and Timor 1999,\nand the Asian tsunami, the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Pakistan earthquake of\n2004/2005, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, and the European migrant crisis\u2014its\ncredo that humane and orderly migration benefits migrants and society has\nsteadily gained more international acceptance."

This broad mandate\nof the organization has earned it praise for flexibility in crisis situations,\nbut also criticism for legal accountability in protection issues. Due to\ncomplementary mandates, IOM often cooperates with the UNHCR.\n\nFor example IOM coordinates work in response to the situation in Venezuela\nthrough the Office of International Organization for Migration Director\nGeneral's Special Envoy for the Regional Response to the Venezuela Situation\nworking with UNHCR and 17 countries in South and Central America and the\nCaribbean.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian\nAffairs (OCHA), IOM is one of the central actors in humanitarian aid within\nthe UN system, especially in the context of displacement. IOM's main aid\nmeasures include shelter, protection, the provision of basic medical and\nsanitary care, life safety, coordination, telecommunications and logistics. On\nthe instructions of the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, IOM, together with\nUNHCR, is primarily responsible for camp coordination and management in\nhumanitarian emergencies. The organization is also active in stabilization,\npeacebuilding and development in the context of migration.\n\n* Internally displaced people receive humanitarian aid after an earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n\n* US Secretary of State Blinken during an IOM mission in Obock, Djibouti.\n\n* Evacuation after a tsunami in Banda Aceh, Sumatra, Indonesia.\n\n* Trees uprooted by Typhoon Haiyan are used for reconstruction aid in the Philippines.\n\n* In Zaatari, Jordan, IOM supports the medical care and education of refugees."
