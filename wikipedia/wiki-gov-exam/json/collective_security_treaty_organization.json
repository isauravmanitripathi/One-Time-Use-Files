The\nCollective Security Treaty has its origins in the Soviet Armed Forces, which\nwas replaced in 1992 by the United Armed Forces of the Commonwealth of\nIndependent States, and was then itself replaced by the successor armed forces\nof the respective independent states. Former members of the CSTO military\nalliance were Azerbaijan, Georgia and Uzbekistan.\n\nSimilar to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and the Inter-American\nTreaty of Reciprocal Assistance, Article 4 of the Collective Security Treaty\n(CST) establishes that an aggression against one signatory would be perceived\nas an aggression against all. The 2002 CSTO charter reaffirmed the desire of\nall participating states to abstain from the use or threat of force.\nSignatories are prohibited from joining other military alliances."

The expansion would\nalso allow all members to purchase Russian weapons at the same price as\nRussia.\n\nOn 29 August 2008, Russia announced it would seek CSTO recognition of the\nindependence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Three days earlier, on 26 August,\nRussia recognized the independence of Georgia's breakaway regions of Abkhazia\nand South Ossetia.\n\nIn 2009, Belarus boycotted the CSTO summit due to their Milk War with Russia.\nAfter refusing to attend a CSTO summit in 2009, Lukashenko said: \"Why should\nmy men fight in Kazakhstan? Mothers would ask me why I sent their sons to\nfight so far from Belarus. For what? For a unified energy market? That is not\nwhat lives depend on. No!\"\n\nAfter Kurmanbek Bakiyev was ousted from office as President of Kyrgyzstan as a\nresult of riots in Kyrgyzstan in April 2010, he was granted asylum in Belarus.\nBelarusian President Alexander Lukashenko expressed doubt about the future of\nthe CSTO for failing to prevent Bakiyev's overthrow, stating: \"What sort of\norganization is this one, if there is bloodshed in one of our member states\nand an anticonstitutional coup d'\u00e9tat takes place, and this body keeps\nsilent?\"\n\nLukashenko had previously accused Russia of punishing Belarus with economic\nsanctions after Lukashenko's refusal to recognize the independence of Abkhazia\nand South Ossetia, stating: \"The economy serves as the basis for our common\nsecurity. But if Belarus's closest CSTO ally is trying ... to destroy this\nbasis and de facto put the Belarusians on their knees, how can one talk about\nconsolidating collective security in the CSTO space?\"\n\nDuring a trip to Ukraine to extend Russia's lease of the Crimean port\nSevastopol in return for discounted natural gas supplies, Russian President\nDmitry Medvedev was asked about whether Belarus could expect a similar deal\nand responded: \"Real partnership is one thing and a declaration of intentions\nis another; reaching agreement on working seriously, meeting each other\nhalfway, helping each other is one thing and making decisions about granting\npermanent residence to people who have lost their job is another.\" The\nBelarusian President defended himself against this criticism by citing former\nRussian President Vladimir Putin's invitation of Askar Akayev to Russia after\nhe was ousted as President of Kyrgyzstan during the 2005 Tulip Revolution.\n\nThe following month, President Medvedev ordered the CEO of Russia's natural\ngas monopoly Gazprom to cut gas supplies to Belarus in a dispute over\noutstanding debts. Subsequently, the Russian television channel NTV, run by\nGazprom, aired a documentary film which compared Lukashenko to Bakiyev. Then\nthe Russian President's foreign policy adviser Sergei Prikhodko threatened to\npublish the transcript of a CSTO meeting where Lukashenko said that his\nadministration would recognize Abkhazian and South Ossetian independence.\n\nIn June 2010, ethnic clashes broke out between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in\nsouthern Kyrgyzstan, leading interim Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva to\nrequest the assistance of Russian troops to quell the disturbances. Kurmanbek\nBakiyev denied charges that his supporters were behind the ethnic conflict and\ncalled on the CSTO to intervene. Askar Akayev also called for the CSTO to send\ntroops, saying: \"Our priority task right now should be to extinguish this\nflame of enmity. It is very likely that we will need CSTO peacekeepers to do\nthat.\"[_citation needed_] The organization was considered by some a \"paper\ntiger\" since it failed to intervene.\n\nRussian President Dmitry Medvedev said that \"only in the case of a foreign\nintrusion and an attempt to externally seize power can we state that there is\nan attack against the CSTO\", and that, \"all the problems of Kyrgyzstan have\ninternal roots\", while CSTO Secretary General Nikolai Bordyuzha called the\nviolence \"purely a domestic affair\". Later, however, Bordyuzha admitted that\nthe CSTO response may have been inadequate and claimed that \"foreign\nmercenaries\" provoked the Kyrgyz violence against ethnic Uzbek minorities.\n\nOn 21 July 2010, interim Kyrgyz President Roza Otunbayeva called for the\nintroduction of CSTO police units to southern Kyrgyzstan saying: \"I think it's\nimportant to introduce CSTO police forces there, since we're unable to\nguarantee people's rights on our own.\" She also added: \"I'm not seeking the\nCSTO's embrace and I don't feel like bringing them here to stay but the\nbloodletting there will continue otherwise.\" Only weeks later the deputy\nchairman of Otubayeva's interim Kyrgyz government complained that their\nappeals for help from the CSTO had been ignored. The CSTO was unable to agree\non providing military assistance to Kyrgyzstan at a meeting in Yerevan,\nArmenia, which was attended by Roza Otunbayeva as well as Alexander\nLukashenko.\n\nThe CSTO meeting in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, 8 November 2018\n\nOn 10 December 2010, the member states approved a declaration establishing a\nCSTO peacekeeping force and a declaration of the CSTO member states, in\naddition to signing a package of joint documents.\n\nSince 21 December 2011, the Treaty parties can veto the establishment of new\nforeign military bases in the member states of the Collective Security Treaty\nOrganization (CSTO).\n\nOn 28 June 2012, Uzbekistan submitted a notification to the CSTO to suspended\nits membership. In December 2012, the CSTO Collective Security Council decided\nto suspend Uzbekistan."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Relations between Russia and Kazakhstan have deteriorated since the start of\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. The latter has refused to recognise the Donetsk\nand the Luhansk People's Republics.\n\nAfter the start of renewed fighting between Armenia and former member\nAzerbaijan on 13 September 2022, Armenia triggered Article 4 of the treaty,\nand a CSTO mission including CSTO Secretary General Stanislav Zas and Anatoly\nSidorov was sent to monitor the situation along the border. Similar events\nalso took place near the Kyrgyzstan\u2013Tajikistan border throughout 2022.\n\nAfter the CSTO mission took a rather uncommitted position in the conflict,\ncriticism towards CSTO membership inside Armenian political circles increased,\nwith the secretary of the Security Council of Armenia, Armen Grigoryan, even\nstating that he saw no more hope for the CSTO. The lack of Russian support\nduring the conflict prompted a national debate in Armenia, as an increasing\npercentage of the population indicated doubt as to whether it is beneficial to\ncontinue CSTO membership, calling for realignment of the state with NATO\ninstead. This coincided with a visit from Speaker of the United States House\nof Representatives Nancy Pelosi to Yerevan on 17 September 2022, largely seen\nas an effort to reorient the security alliance structure of Armenia.\n\nTo discuss the results of the CSTO mission sent on 15 September 2022, an\nextraordinary session of the CSTO was held via videoconference on 28 October\n2022. With the leaders of all member states and CSTO Secretary General\nStanislav Zas in attendance, the meeting was chaired by Armenian Prime\nMinister Nikol Pashinyan, who concurred with the report presented by the\nSecretary General while also reiterating the importance for a clear political\nassessment of Azerbaijani aggression and a roadmap for the restoration of\nArmenian territorial integrity.\n\nA regular Collective Security Council meeting took place on 23 November 2022\nwith the leaders of all CSTO members present to discuss matters of\ninternational and regional security. After Pashinyan refused to sign the joint\ndeclaration because it did not \"reach a decision on a CSTO response to\nAzerbaijan's aggression against Armenia\", speculation arose regarding the\ncontinuation of the CSTO. Secretary General Stanislas Zas indicated that,\nthough numerous measures in the diplomatic as well as military spheres were\ngenerally agreed upon, no consensus regarding the situation on the border\ncould be reached. On the occasion of the meeting and in the midst of the 2022\nRussian invasion of Ukraine, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated\nthat many in their countries had started to discuss the possibility that the\nCSTO may cease to exist if Russia loses its war in Ukraine. He later expanded\non his opinion on the matter, stating that the CSTO will continue on and\nnobody will fall, if there is unity. Meanwhile, during the meeting in Yerevan,\nlarge groups of protestors gathered and called for the withdrawal of Armenia\nfrom the CSTO and for the country to develop closer relations with the United\nStates and the West. In the aftermath of the meeting, the US think tank The\nNational Interest released an analysis on the current state of the CSTO,\nconcluding that, while the alliance is in a fragile state, only few other\nnations could fill the void created by a possible Russian exit and step in as\na power broker in the region. Economic dependencies between the member states\nhave also increased since the start of the invasion and would dissuade the\nalliance from splitting up.\n\nThe diplomatic friction continued into January 2023, after Pashinyan refused\nto hold common military drills, because the organization did not unequivocally\ncondemn Azerbaijan over its perceived aggression. In response, Dmitry Peskov,\nthe Press Secretary of the President of Russia, stated that Armenia remains a\nvery close ally and promised to continue the dialogue. To mend their ties,\nSergey Lavrov offered the deployment of a CSTO mission along the Armenia-\nAzerbaijan border on 2 February 2023 within one or two days, \"if our Armenian\nallies, friends are still interested in it like before\".\n\nMeeting of the Council of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Collective\nSecurity Treaty Organization in Minsk (May 2023)\n\nIn May 2023, after the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated, the\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said that Armenia could consider\nwithdrawing from the treaty due to the lack of support from Russia in the\nconflict. In an interview with CNN broadcast on 1 June 2023, Pashinyan stated\nthat \"Armenia is not an ally of Russia in the war in Ukraine\".\n\nOn 3 September 2023, during an interview, Armenian prime minister Nikol\nPashinyan stated that it was a strategic mistake for Armenia to solely rely on\nRussia to guarantee its security. Pashinyan stated, \"Moscow has been unable to\ndeliver and is in the process of winding down its role in the wider South\nCaucasus region\" and \"the Russian Federation cannot meet Armenia's security\nneeds. This example should demonstrate to us that dependence on just one\npartner in security matters is a strategic mistake.\" Pashinyan accused Russian\npeacekeepers deployed to uphold the ceasefire deal of failing to do their job.\nPashinyan confirmed that Armenia was trying to diversify its security\narrangements, most notably with the European Union and the United States.\n\nDuring the September 2023 Armenian protests that began following the 2023\nAzerbaijani offensive in Nagorno-Karabakh, demonstrators surrounded the\nRussian embassy in Yerevan criticizing Russia's refusal to intervene in the\noffensive. Some protesters called for the rejection of the Alma-Ata Protocol,\nand Armenia's withdrawal from the CSTO.\n\nArmenia declined participating in military exercises at the CIS summit in\nKyrgyzstan in October 2023 and asked for Russian peacekeeping forces to return\nto Russia. The Prime Minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, went further in\nlate October saying he saw \"no advantage\" in the presence of Russian troops in\nArmenia. as of October 2023[update], approximately 10,000 Russian troops were\nstationed in Gyumri.\n\n2024 CSTO Summit in Astana\n\nOn 23 February 2024, Armenian Prime Minister, Nikol Pashinyan, confirmed that\nArmenia had frozen its participation in the CSTO. Pashinyan stated, \"We have\nnow in practical terms frozen our participation in this treaty\" and\n\"membership of the CSTO was under review\" during a live broadcast interview.\nOn 28 February 2024, during a speech made in the National Assembly, Pashinyan\nfurther stated that the CSTO is \"a threat to the national security of\nArmenia\". Responding to Pashinyan's remarks, Dmitri Peskov stated that the\nCSTO charter does not include provisions for a \"frozen membership\" status. On\n12 March, Pashinyan said that the CSTO needed to clarify \"what constitutes\nArmenia's sovereign territory\", as the organization had not come to Armenia's\ndefence when requested following Azerbaijani troops crossing the border into\nArmenia's internationally recognized territory. Pashinyan said that if the\nCSTO's response did not align with Armenia's expectations, the country would\nofficially withdraw from the organization. On 8 May 2024, Armenia announced it\nhad stopped making financial contributions to the CSTO, leading Russia to\nstate that it was still obligated to pay its membership dues. On 12 June 2024,\nArmenia announced that it would formally withdraw from the alliance at an\nunspecified later date, with Pashinyan stating, \"We will leave. We will decide\nwhen to exit...Don't worry, we won't return\".\n\nA July 2024 Gallup opinion poll noted a 7% increase in support for Armenia's\nmembership in NATO, with 29% of respondents believing Armenia should strive\nfor NATO membership. Meanwhile, support for Armenia's membership in the CSTO\ndecreased by 10%, with only 16.9% believing Armenia should maintain its\nmembership in the CSTO.\n\nOn 6 August 2024, the Ukrainian Armed Forces launched an incursion into\nRussia's Kursk Oblast and clashed with the Russian Armed Forces and Russian\nborder guard. On 17 August 2024, it was reported that CSTO countries have\nneither supported nor condemned the Ukrainian invasion of Russia.\n\nOn 4 December 2024, during parliamentary discussions in the National Assembly,\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that \"we already consider\nourselves outside the CSTO\" and \"I believe we have crossed the point of no\nreturn\" in regards to Armenia's membership status in the CSTO."
