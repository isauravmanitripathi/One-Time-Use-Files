Its member states are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,\nMaldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. SAARC comprises 3% of the world's\nland area, 21% of the world's population and 5.21% (US$4.47 trillion) of the\nglobal economy, as of 2021.\n\nSAARC was founded in Dhaka on 8 December 1985. Its secretariat is based in\nKathmandu, Nepal. The organization promotes economic development and regional\nintegration. It launched the South Asian Free Trade Area in 2006. SAARC\nmaintains permanent diplomatic relations at the United Nations as an observer\nand has developed links with multilateral entities, including the European\nUnion. However, due to the geopolitical conflict between India and Pakistan\nand the situation in Afghanistan, the organization has been suspended for a\nlong time, and India currently cooperates with its eastern neighbors through\nBIMSTEC."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The idea of co-operation among South Asian Countries was discussed in three\nconferences: the Asian Relations Conference held in New Delhi in April 1947;\nthe Baguio Conference in the Philippines in May 1950; and the Colombo Powers\nConference held in Sri Lanka in April 1954.\n\nA clickable Euler diagram showing the relationships between various Asian\nregional organizations\n\n* v\n* t\n* e\n\nIn the ending years of the 1970s, the seven inner South Asian nations that\nincluded Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri\nLanka, agreed upon the creation of a trade bloc and to provide a platform for\nthe people of South Asia to work together in a spirit of friendship, trust,\nand understanding. For Bangladesh, a prime reason for proposing this regional\ncooperation framework was the failure of its attempt to join ASEAN. Seeking to\nreplicate the sucesses of ASEAN and a way to legitimise his government,\nPresident Ziaur Rahman of Bangladesh later wrote official letters to the\nleaders of the countries of South Asia, presenting his vision for the future\nof the region and compelling arguments for co-operation.\n\nDuring his visit to India in December 1977, Rahman discussed the issue of\nregional cooperation with the Indian Prime Minister, Morarji Desai. In the\ninaugural speech to the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee which met in\nKathmandu also in 1977, King Birendra of Nepal gave a call for close regional\ncooperation among South Asian countries in sharing river waters.\n\nAfter the USSR's intervention in Afghanistan, efforts to establish the union\nwere accelerated in 1979 amid the resulting rapid deterioration of the South\nAsian security situation. Responding to Rahman and Birendra's convention,\nofficials of the foreign ministries of the seven countries met for the first\ntime in Colombo in April 1981. The Bangladeshi proposal was promptly endorsed\nby Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Maldives, however India and Pakistan were\nsceptical initially. The Indian concern was the proposal's reference to the\nsecurity matters in South Asia and feared that Rahman's proposal for a\nregional organisation might provide an opportunity for new smaller neighbours\nto re-internationalize all bilateral issues and to join with each other to\nform an opposition against India. Pakistan assumed that it might be an Indian\nstrategy to organize the other South Asian countries against Pakistan and\nensure a regional market for Indian products, thereby consolidating and\nfurther strengthening India's economic dominance in the region.\n\nHowever, after a series of diplomatic consultations headed by Bangladesh\nbetween South Asian UN representatives at the UN headquarters in New York,\nfrom September 1979 to 1980, it was agreed that Bangladesh would prepare the\ndraft of a working paper for discussion among the foreign secretaries of South\nAsian countries. The foreign secretaries of the inner seven countries again\ndelegated a Committee of the Whole in Colombo in September 1981, which\nidentified five broad areas for regional cooperation. New areas of co-\noperation were added in the following years.\n\nIn 1983, at the international conference held in Dhaka by its Ministry of\nForeign Affairs, the foreign ministers of the inner seven countries adopted\nthe Declaration on South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\nand formally launched the Integrated Programme of Action (IPA) initially in\nfive agreed areas of cooperation, namely, Agriculture; Rural Development;\nTelecommunications; Meteorology; and Health and Population Activities.\n\nOfficially, the union was established in Dhaka with Kathmandu being the\nunion's secretariat-general. The first SAARC summit was held in Dhaka on 7\u20138\nDecember 1985 and hosted by the President of Bangladesh Hussain Ershad. The\ndeclaration was signed by, namely, King of Bhutan Jigme Singye Wangchuk;\nPresident of Pakistan Zia-ul-Haq; Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi; King\nof Nepal Birendra Shah; President of Sri Lanka JR Jayewardene; and President\nof Maldives Maumoon Gayoom."

In 2005, Afghanistan began\nnegotiating their accession to SAARC and formally applied for membership in\nthe same year. The issue of Afghanistan joining SAARC generated a great deal\nof debate in each member state, including concerns about the definition of\nSouth Asian identity because Afghanistan is considered a Central Asian\ncountry, while it is neither accepted as a Middle Eastern country, nor as a\nCentral Asian country, or as part of the Indian subcontinent, other than being\nonly in part of South Asia.\n\nSAARC member states imposed a stipulation for Afghanistan to hold a general\nelection; the non-partisan elections were held in late 2005. Despite initial\nreluctance and internal debates, Afghanistan joined SAARC as its eighth member\nstate in April 2007.\n\nDespite the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban in 2021, Afghanistan is\nstill a member of SAARC, despite calls for their suspension and none of the\nother SAARC members recognizing the Taliban government. The issue was further\nexasperated as it was Afghanistan's turn to select a Secretary General for\nSAARC in 2023. All other members decided to skip Afghanistan and award the\nselection to Bangladesh, with Nepali foreign secretary, Bharat Raj Paudyal,\nstating that \"When the term of the Bangladeshi secretary general ends, if the\nproblems in Afghanistan are resolved, the new secretary general will be from\nAfghanistan, not from Bhutan.\""

        "generated_section_content_md": "Lasting peace and prosperity in South Asia has been elusive because of the\nvarious ongoing conflicts in the region. Political dialogue is often conducted\non the margins of SAARC meetings which have refrained from interfering in the\ninternal matters of its member states. During the 12th and 13th SAARC summits,\nextreme emphasis was laid upon greater cooperation between SAARC members to\nfight terrorism.\n\nThe 19th SAARC summit scheduled to be held in Pakistan was called off as\nIndia, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Afghanistan decided to boycott it due to a\nterrorist attack on an army camp in Uri. It was the first time that four\ncountries boycotted a SAARC summit, leading to its cancellation.\n\nThe failure of SAARC can also be attributed to conflicts among some of its\nmembers. Pakistan would \u201cindirectly target\u201d India at summits, and \u201ctry to get\nthe other members to gang up against Delhi,\u201d a retired Sri Lankan foreign\nsecretary told _The Diplomat_ in 2019. India, for its part, continued to\nemphasize its concerns over terrorism linked to Pakistan, which it regarded as\na bilateral matter and therefore not appropriate for discussion in\nmultilateral settings.\n\nSAARC has faced persistent challenges related to terrorism, including cross-\nborder militancy and allegations of state-sponsored extremism, over several\ndecades. In this context, terrorism has come to symbolize the organization's\nstagnation, exacerbating existing divisions among member states. According to\nglobal and regional terrorism analysts, terrorism in South Asia manifests in\nvarious forms\u2014such as state-supported militancy, extremist groups with alleged\nstate backing, separatist movements, and transnational extremist\nnetworks\u2014contributing to broader regional instability. The 2016 Uri attack\nsignificantly impacted bilateral diplomatic relations and further hindered\nregional cooperation efforts within SAARC.\n\nFollowing political changes in Bangladesh, Dr. Muhammad Yunus, who served as\nthe chief adviser to the interim government in Bangladesh, had publicly\nexpressed interest in revitalizing the South Asian Association for Regional\nCooperation (SAARC) on multiple occasions. However, some policymakers in India\nviewed Bangladesh's initiative with skepticism. India\u2019s External Affairs\nMinister, S. Jaishankar, reportedly indicated that Bangladesh was \u201cbatting for\nPakistan\u201d by attempting to revive SAARC. During a bilateral meeting between\nBangladesh\u2019s Foreign Affairs Adviser Towhid Hossain and External Affairs\nMinister Jaishankar in Muscat, Oman, on 16 February, India issued a strong\nstatement on terrorism. According to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA),\nJaishankar urged Bangladesh \u201cto stop batting for Pakistan and normalising\nterrorism\u201d through efforts to resume SAARC\u2019s activities. MEA spokesperson\nRandhir Jaiswal, speaking at a press briefing, stated: \u201cEveryone in South Asia\nis aware of which country and what activities are responsible for stymieing\nSAARC. EAM conveyed that it is important that Bangladesh should not normalise\nterrorism.\u201d While Pakistan was not named directly, the remarks were widely\ninterpreted as referring to its alleged role in undermining regional\ncooperation.\n\nDr. Minendra Rijal, former Defence Minister of Nepal, stated that Pakistan\u2019s\nsupport for terrorism has contributed to the stagnation of SAARC, obstructed\nregional economic integration, and resulted in substantial economic losses for\nPakistan.\n\nChina too has been trying to undermine the SAARC grouping and has been\nsuggesting alternatives for the same. Analysts in New Delhi have expressed\nlittle surprise at the proposed initiative by China and Pakistan for regional\ncooperation in South Asia. According to a research fellow at the Manohar\nParrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, China has sought to\npromote alternative regional frameworks since its proposal to join SAARC was\nrejected in 2005. Over the past two decades, it has launched several\nmechanisms for regional engagement, including the China-South Asia Cooperation\nForum in 2006, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Trans-Himalayan Connectivity\nNetwork in 2018\u2014which includes Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nepal\u2014and the China-\nSouth Asian Countries Poverty Alleviation and Cooperative Development Center\nin 2021.All South Asian countries, except India and Bhutan, are members of the\nBRI. As such, the latest proposal for regional cooperation is seen as part of\nChina's continued efforts to build alternatives to SAARC.\n\nSAARC has generally been ineffective at achieving enhanced regionalism."

In 1995, Sixteenth session of the\nCouncil of Ministers (New Delhi, 18\u201319 December 1995) agreed on the need to\nstrive for the realization of SAFTA and to this end, an Inter-Governmental\nExpert Group (IGEG) was set up in 1996 to identify the necessary steps for\nprogressing to a free trade area. The Tenth SAARC Summit (Colombo, 29\u201331 July\n1998) decided to set up a Committee of Experts (COE) to draft a comprehensive\ntreaty framework for creating a free trade area within the region, taking into\nconsideration the asymmetries in development within the region and bearing in\nmind the need to fix realistic and achievable targets.\n\nThe SAFTA Agreement was signed on 6 January 2004 during Twelfth SAARC Summit\nheld in Islamabad, Pakistan. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January\n2006, and the Trade Liberalization Programme commenced from 1 July 2006. Under\nthis agreement, SAARC members will bring their duties down to 20 percent by\n2009. Following the Agreement coming into force the SAFTA Ministerial Council\n(SMC) has been established comprising the Commerce Ministers of the Member\nStates. In 2012 SAARC exports increased substantially to $354.6 billion from\n$206.7 billion in 2009. Imports too increased from $330 billion to $602\nbillion over the same period. But the intra-SAARC trade amounts to just a\nlittle over 1% of SAARC's GDP. In contrast to SAARC, in ASEAN (which is\nactually smaller than SAARC in terms of the size of the economy) the intra-\nbloc trade stands at 10% of its GDP.\n\nThe SAFTA was envisaged to gradually move towards the South Asian Economic\nUnion, but the current intra-regional trade and investment relation are not\nencouraging and it may be difficult to achieve this target. SAARC intra-\nregional trade stands at just five percent on the share of intra-regional\ntrade in overall trade in South Asia. Similarly, foreign direct investment is\nalso dismal. The intra-regional FDI flow stands at around four percent of the\ntotal foreign investment.\n\nThe Asian Development Bank has estimated that inter-regional trade in SAARC\nregion possessed the potential of shooting up agricultural exports by $14\nbillion per year from existing level of $8 billion to $22 billion. The study\nby Asian Development Bank states that against the potential average SAARC\nintra-regional trade of $22 billion per year, the actual trade in South Asia\nhas been only around $8 billion. The uncaptured potential for intra-regional\ntrade is therefore $14 billion per year, i.e., 68%."

As directed by the\nSummit, the Council of Ministers regularly kept under review the list of\nentitled categories.\n\nCurrently, the list included 24 categories of entitled persons, which include\ndignitaries, judges of higher courts, parliamentarians, senior officials,\nentrepreneurs, journalists, and athletes.\n\nThe Visa Stickers are issued by the respective Member States to the entitled\ncategories of that particular country. The validity of the Visa Sticker is\ngenerally for one year. The implementation is reviewed regularly by the\nImmigration Authorities of SAARC Member States."
