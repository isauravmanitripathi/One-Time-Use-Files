It was established at\nthe Ninth Non-Aligned Movement Summit Meeting in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in\nSeptember 1989, and is composed of countries from Latin America, Africa, and\nAsia with a common goal of enhanced growth and prosperity. The G-15 focuses on\ncooperation among developing countries in the areas of investment, trade, and\ntechnology. Chile, Iran and Kenya have since joined the Group of 15, whereas\nYugoslavia is no longer part of the group, and Peru, a founding member-state,\ndecided to leave the G-15 in 2011. Membership thus has since expanded to 17\ncountries, but the forum's name remains unchanged."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Some of the objectives of the G-15 are:\n\n* To harness the considerable potential for greater and mutually beneficial cooperation among developing countries\n* To conduct a regular review of the impact of the world situation and of the state of international economic relations on developing countries\n* To serve as a forum for regular consultations among developing countries with a view to coordinate policies and actions\n* To identify and implement new and concrete schemes for South-South cooperation and mobilize wider support for them\n* To pursue a more positive and productive North-South dialogue and to find new ways of dealing with problems in a cooperative, constructive and mutually supportive manner.\n\nBy design, the G-15 has avoided establishing an administrative structure like\nthose for international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World\nBank; but the G-15 does have a Technical Support Facility (TSF) located in\nGeneva. The TSF functions under the direction of the Chairman for the current\nyear. The TSF provides necessary support for the activities of the G-15 and\nfor its objectives. Other organs and functions of the G-15 include:\n\n* Summit of heads of state and government: The G-15's summit is organized biennially, with the venue being rotated among the three developing regions of the G-15 membership.\n* Annual meetings of Ministers of Foreign Affairs: G-15 Ministers of Foreign Affairs typically meet once a year to coordinate group activities and to prepare for the nest summit of G-15 leaders.\n* Steering committee (_Troika_): A steering committee, or _Troika_ , is composed of three foreign ministers, one from the preceding summit host country, the present host country and the anticipated next host countries. These three are responsible for oversight and coordination.\n* Personal representatives of heads of state and government: Each member country is represented by personal representatives of heads of state and government who meet regularly in Geneva.\n\nIn addition, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Services\n(FCCIS) is a private sector forum of G-15 member countries. The purpose of the\nFCCIS is to coordinate and maximize efforts which promote business, economic\ndevelopment and joint investment in G-15 nations.\n\nIn 2010, the chairmanship of the G-15 was accepted by Sri Lanka at the\nconclusion of the 14th G-15 summit in Tehran."
