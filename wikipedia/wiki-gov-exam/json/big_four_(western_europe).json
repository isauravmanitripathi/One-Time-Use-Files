France and the United Kingdom are\nofficial nuclear-weapon states and are permanent members of the United Nations\nSecurity Council with the power of veto, which enables any one of them to\nprevent the adoption of any \"substantive\" draft Council resolution, regardless\nof its level of international support. The United Kingdom is the only country\nof the Big Four which is not a member state of the European Union, having\nended its membership in 2020, pursuant to a referendum held in 2016. France,\nGermany, Italy and the United Kingdom are considered major European powers and\nthey are the Western European countries individually represented as full\nmembers of the G7 and the G20. They have been referred to as the \"Big Four of\nEurope\" since the interwar period.\n\nThe term G4 was used for the first time when French President Nicolas Sarkozy\ncalled for a meeting in Paris with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi,\nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to\nconsider the response to the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development describes them as\nthe \"Four Big European Countries\"."

        "generated_section_content_md": "France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom have been referred to as the\n\"Big Four of Europe\" since the interwar period (1919\u20131939), when the four\ncountries signed the Four-Power Pact and the Munich Agreement. Britain and\nFrance, permanent members of the League of Nations' executive council along\nwith Italy and Japan, were involved in a policy of appeasement towards\nGermany. World War II (1939\u20131945) saw the United States, the United Kingdom,\nRussia, France and China fighting against Germany, Italy and Japan. The defeat\nof the Axis powers resulted in the formation of the United Nations, where the\nfive victorious countries of the Allied powers were granted a permanent seat\nin the Security Council. Germany, Italy and Japan experienced a post-war\neconomic miracle and took part in the 1st G6 summit along with France, the\nUnited Kingdom and the United States in 1975.\n\nSince 1945, France and Great Britain have often acted alone in defence policy\nmatters while Germany and Italy have preferred to act within the framework of\ninternational organisations. For example, France, Germany, Italy and the UK\nwere the EU countries represented in the Syria peace talks, but only France\nand the UK are directly bombing ISIS in Syria, while Germany and Italy prefer\nto give military aid and to send training troops.\n\nUS President Barack Obama with EU4 leaders Hollande, Cameron, Merkel and Renzi\nduring the 2014 Wales summit"
