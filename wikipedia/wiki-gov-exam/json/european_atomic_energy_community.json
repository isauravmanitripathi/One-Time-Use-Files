        "generated_section_content_md": "International organization\n\nThe **European Atomic Energy Community** (**EAEC** or **EURATOM**) is an\ninternational organization established by the Euratom Treaty of 1957 with the\noriginal purpose of creating a specialist market for nuclear power in Europe,\nby developing nuclear energy and distributing it to its member states while\nselling the surplus to non-member states. Having become one of the three\nEuropean Communities alongside the European Coal and Steel Community and the\nEuropean Economic Community following the merger of their executive bodies in\n1967, the Euratom is _de facto_ under the authority of the European Union (EU)\nbut remains _de jure_ a separate organization.\n\nIt is legally distinct from the European Union although it has the same\nmembership, and is governed by many of the EU's institutions; but it is the\nonly remaining community organization that is independent of the EU and\ntherefore outside the regulatory control of the European Parliament. Over the\nyears its scope has been increased to cover a variety of areas associated with\nnuclear power and ionising radiation as diverse as safeguarding of nuclear\nmaterials, radiation protection, coordinating EU members' nuclear research\nprogrammes for peaceful purposes, and construction of the International Fusion\nReactor.\n\nSince 2014, Switzerland has also participated in Euratom programmes as an\nassociated state. The United Kingdom ceased to be a full member of the\norganization on 31 January 2020. However, under the terms of the EU\u2013UK Trade\nand Cooperation Agreement, the United Kingdom participates in Euratom as an\nassociated state following the end of the transition period on 31 December\n2020."

        "generated_section_content_md": "From left to right: Konrad Adenauer, Walter Hallstein, and Antonio Segni\nsigning the European customs union and Euratom Treaty in Rome, Italy\n(Bundesarchiv, 1 April 1957)\n\nThe driving force behind the creation of the European Atomic Energy Community\n(EURATOM) was France's desire to develop nuclear power and nuclear weapons\nwithout having to rely on the United States and/or the United Kingdom. The\ncosts of nuclear development were also large, motivating France to share the\ncosts with the other member states of the European Coal and Steel Community\n(ECSC). During the negotiations to create Euratom, the United States and the\nUnited Kingdom sought to gain influence over nuclear development in Europe.\nHence, the US and the UK created the European Nuclear Energy Agency (ENEA) as\na way to limit the value of Euratom and gain influence over the spread of\nnuclear technology. The Soviet Union launched a propaganda campaign against\nEuratom, as it sought to stoke fears among Europeans that the organization\nwould enable West Germany to develop nuclear weapons for its own military\npurposes.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the\nCh\u00e2teau of Val-Duchesse in 1956 drew up the essentials of the new treaties.\nEuratom would foster cooperation in the nuclear field, at the time a very\npopular area, and would, along with the EEC, share the Common Assembly and\nCourt of Justice of the ECSC, but not its executives. Euratom would have its\nown Council and Commission, with fewer powers than the High Authority of the\nEuropean Coal and Steel Community. On 25 March 1957, the Treaties of Rome (the\nEuratom Treaty and the EEC Treaty) were signed by the six ECSC members and on\n1 January 1958 they came into force.\n\nThe Common Assembly proposed extending the powers of the ECSC to cover other\nsources of energy. However, Jean Monnet, ECSC architect and President, wanted\na separate community to cover nuclear power. The President of the European\nCommission, Louis Armand, was put in charge of a study into the prospects of\nnuclear energy use in Europe; his report concluded that further nuclear\ndevelopment was needed to fill the deficit left by the exhaustion of coal\ndeposits and to reduce dependence on oil producers. However, the Benelux\ncountries and West Germany were also keen on creating a general single market,\nalthough it was opposed by France due to its protectionism, and Jean Monnet\nthought it too large and difficult a task. In 1957, Monnet proposed the\ncreation of separate atomic energy and economic communities to reconcile both\ngroups. To save on resources, these separate executives created by the Rome\nTreaties were unified by the Merger Treaty in 1967. The institutions of the\nEEC would take over responsibilities for the running of the ECSC and Euratom,\nwith all three then becoming known as the European Communities even if each\nlegally existed separately. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty set the foundation\nof the European Union (EU), which absorbed the Communities into the European\nCommunity pillar, while Euratom still maintained a distinct legal personality.\n\nThe European Constitution was intended to consolidate all previous treaties\nand increase democratic accountability in them. The Euratom Treaty had not\nbeen amended as the other treaties had, so the European Parliament had been\ngranted few powers over it. However, the reason it had gone unamended was the\nsame reason the Constitution left it to remain separate from the rest of the\nEU: a strong anti-nuclear sentiment among the European electorate, which may\nunnecessarily turn voters against the treaty. The Euratom treaty thus remains\nin force relatively unamended from its original signing."

The Franco-British alliance established by the Dunkirk Treaty was _de facto_ superseded by WU. The CFSP pillar was bolstered by some of the security structures that had been established within the remit of the 1955 Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT). The Brussels Treaty was terminated in 2011, consequently dissolving the WEU, as the mutual defence clause that the Lisbon Treaty provided for EU was considered to render the WEU superfluous. The EU thus _de facto_ superseded the WEU.\n2. **^** Plans to establish a European Political Community (EPC) were shelved following the French failure to ratify the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC). The EPC would have combined the ECSC and the EDC.\n3. **^** The European Communities obtained common institutions and a shared legal personality (i.e. ability to e.g. sign treaties in their own right).\n4. **^** The treaties of Maastricht and Rome form the EU's legal basis, and are also referred to as the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), respectively. They are amended by secondary treaties.\n5. **^** Between the EU's founding in 1993 and consolidation in 2009, the union consisted of three pillars, the first of which were the European Communities. The other two pillars consisted of additional areas of cooperation that had been added to the EU's remit.\n6. **^** The consolidation meant that the EU inherited the European Communities' legal personality and that the pillar system was abolished, resulting in the EU framework as such covering all policy areas. Executive/legislative power in each area was instead determined by a distribution of competencies between EU institutions and member states. This distribution, as well as treaty provisions for policy areas in which unanimity is required and qualified majority voting is possible, reflects the depth of EU integration as well as the EU's partly supranational and partly intergovernmental nature."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The United Kingdom announced its intention to withdraw from the EAEC on 26\nJanuary 2017, following on from its decision to withdraw from the European\nUnion. Formal notice to withdraw from the EAEC was provided in March 2017,\nwithin the Article 50 notification letter, where the withdrawal was made\nexplicit. Withdrawal only became effective following negotiations on the terms\nof the exit, which lasted two years and ten months.\n\nA report by the House of Commons' Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\nCommittee, published in May 2017, questioned the legal necessity of leaving\nEuratom, and called for a temporary extension of the United Kingdom's\nmembership of Euratom in order to allow time for new arrangements to be made\ninstead. In June 2017, the European Commission's negotiations task force\npublished a _Position paper transmitted to EU27 on nuclear materials and\nsafeguard equipment (Euratom)_ , titled \"Essential Principles on nuclear\nmaterials and safeguard equipment\". The following month, a briefing paper from\nthe House of Commons Library assessed the implications of leaving Euratom.\n\nIn July 2017, an article published by the _The Independent_ questioned the\navailability of nuclear power to the United Kingdom after 2019 if the country\nwere to withdraw from the Euratom Treaty, and the need for new treaties\nrelating to the transportation of nuclear materials. During the same month, an\narticle published by the _New Scientist_ stated that radioisotope supply for\ncancer treatments would also need to be considered in new treaties.\n\nBritish politicians speculated that the United Kingdom could retain its\nmembership in the EAEC. In 2017, some argued that this would require\u2014beyond\nthe consent of the EU27\u2014amendment or revocation of the Article 50 letter of\nMarch 2017. The _Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018_ , making provision for\nsafeguards after withdrawal from Euratom, received royal assent on 26 June\n2018.\n\nThe EU\u2013UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, outlining the United Kingdom's\nrelationship with the European Union from 1 January 2021 onwards, makes\nprovision for the country's participation \"as an associated country of all\nparts of the Euratom programme\"."
