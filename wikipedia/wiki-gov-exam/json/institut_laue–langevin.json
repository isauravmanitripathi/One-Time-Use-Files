It is one of the world centres for research using neutrons. Founded in\n1967 and honouring the physicists Max von Laue and Paul Langevin, the ILL\nprovides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most\nintense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5\u00d71015\nneutrons per second per cm2, with a thermal power of typically 58.3\nMW.[_citation needed_]\n\nThe ILL neutron scattering facilities allow the analysis of the structure of\nconducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the\nmeasurement of stresses in mechanical materials. It also allows investigations\ninto macromolecular assemblies, particularly protein dynamics and biomolecular\nstructure. It is a world-renowned centre for nanoscale science.[_citation\nneeded_]"

These partner states provide,\nthrough Research Councils, the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have\nsince become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may\napply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other\ncountries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific\ncouncil involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for\nresearchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is\ncharged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750\nexperiments are completed every year, in fields including magnetism,\nsuperconductivity, materials engineering, and the study of liquids, colloids\nand biological substances such as proteins. [_citation needed_]\n\nThe high-flux research reactor produces neutrons through fission in a compact-\ncore fuel element. Neutron moderators cool the neutrons to wavelengths usable\nexperimentally. Neutrons are then directed at a suite of instruments to probe\nthe structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic\nneutron scattering, and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the\nneutron. Fission products and gamma rays produced by nuclear reactions in the\nreactor core are also used by the instrument suite.\n\nIn 2000 began the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The\nfirst phase has already resulted in a 17-fold gains in performance. The second\nphase started in 2008: it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the\nupgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.[_citation\nneeded_]"
