The WEU\nimplemented the Modified Brussels Treaty. During the Cold War, the Western\nBloc included the WEU member-states, plus the United States and Canada, as\npart of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nThe Cold War ended c. 1991, and at the turn of the 21st century, WEU tasks and\ninstitutions were gradually transferred to the European Union (EU), providing\ncentral parts of the EU's new military component, the European Common Security\nand Defence Policy (CSDP). This process was completed in 2009 when a\nsolidarity clause between the member states of the European Union, which was\nsimilar (but not identical) to the WEU's mutual-defence clause, entered into\nforce with the Treaty of Lisbon. The states party to the Modified Treaty of\nBrussels consequently decided to terminate that treaty on 31 March 2010, with\nall the WEU's remaining activities to cease within 15 months. On 30 June 2011,\nthe WEU officially ceased to exist; with the European Union taking over its\nactivities."

In December 1950 the parties to the\nTreaty of Brussels decided to transfer the headquarters, personnel, and plans\nof the Western Union Defence Organisation (WUDO) to NATO, whose Supreme\nHeadquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) took over responsibility for the\ndefence of Western Europe.\n\nThe establishment of NATO, along with the signing of a succession of treaties\nestablishing the Organisation for European Economic Cooperation (April 1948),\nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (April 1949), the Council of Europe\n(May 1949) and the European Coal and Steel Community (April 1951), left the\nTreaty of Brussels and its Western Union devoid of authority."

This, in\naddition to the existence of NATO, marginalised the WEU, and caused it to be\nlargely defunct.\n\nOn 1 January 1960 in accordance with the decision taken on 21 October 1959 by\nthe Council of Western European Union and with Resolution(59)23 adopted on 16\nNovember 1959 by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, the WEU\nactivities in social and cultural areas (Social Committee, Public Health\nCommittee, Joint Committee on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement of the\nDisabled and Cultural Committee) were transferred to the Council of Europe\nwhich was already running programmes in these fields. The European\nUniversities Committee (see CM(60)4; C(59)127 and CM(59)130) was transferred\nto the Council of Europe separately from the rest of WEU cultural activities."

Opposition to these efforts from Denmark,\nGreece and Ireland led the remaining EC countries \u2013 all WEU members \u2013 to\nreactivate the WEU in 1984 by adopting the Rome Declaration. Prior to this\npoint there had been minimal use of the provisions of the Modified Brussels\nTreaty.\n\nHotel Petersberg, where the Petersberg tasks were defined in 1992.\n\nIn 1992, the WEU adopted the Petersberg Declaration, defining the so-called\n_Petersberg tasks_ designed to cope with the possible destabilising of Eastern\nEurope. The WEU itself had no standing army but depended on cooperation\nbetween its members. Its tasks ranged from the most modest to the most robust,\nand included humanitarian, rescue and peacekeeping tasks as well as tasks for\ncombat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking.\n\nAt the 1996 NATO ministerial meeting in Berlin, it was agreed that the Western\nEuropean Union would oversee the creation of a European Security and Defence\nIdentity (ESDI) within NATO structures. The ESDI was intended as a European\n'pillar' within NATO, partly to allow European countries to act militarily\nwhere NATO wished not to, and partly to alleviate the United States' financial\nburden of maintaining military bases in Europe, which it had done since the\nCold War. The Berlin agreement allowed European countries (through the WEU) to\nuse NATO assets if it so wished."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In 1998 the United Kingdom, which had traditionally opposed the introduction\nof European autonomous defence capacities, signed the Saint-Malo declaration.\nThis marked a turning point as the declaration endorsed the creation of a\nEuropean security and defense policy, including a European military force\ncapable of autonomous action. The declaration was a response to the Kosovo War\nin the late 1990s, in which the EU was perceived to have failed to intervene\nto stop the conflict.\n\nConcerns were voiced that an independent European security pillar could\nundermine NATO; In response to St. Malo, the former US-Secretary of State\nMadeleine Albright put forth the three famous D's: no duplication of what was\ndone effectively under NATO, no decoupling from the US and NATO, and no\ndiscrimination against non-EU members such as Turkey.\n\nHigh Representative Javier Solana (September 1999)\n\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam, which entered into force in 1999, transferred the\nWEU's Petersberg tasks to the EU, and stated that the EU's Common Security and\nDefence Policy (CSDP), replacing the WEU's ESDI, would be 'progressively\nframed' on the basis of these tasks.\n\nIn June 1999, the Cologne European Council decided to incorporate the role of\nthe WEU within the EU, effectively abandoning the WEU. The Cologne Council\nalso appointed Javier Solana as the High Representative for Common Foreign and\nSecurity Policy to help progress both the CFSP and the CSDP. On 20 November\n1999 Solana was also appointed Secretary-General of the WEU. His being head of\nboth organisations permits him to oversee the ongoing transfer of functions\nfrom the WEU to the EU.\n\nIn 2002 the Berlin agreement from 1996 was amended with the so-called Berlin\nPlus agreement, which allowed the EU to also draw on some of NATO's assets in\nits own peacekeeping operations.\n\nOriginally, under the Amsterdam Treaty, the WEU was given an integral role in\ngiving the EU an independent defence capability, playing a major role in the\nPetersberg tasks; however that situation is changing. On 13 November 2000, WEU\nMinisters met in Marseille and agreed to begin transferring the organisation's\ncapabilities and functions to the European Union, under its developing Common\nForeign and Security Policy (CFSP) and Common Security and Defence Policy\n(CSDP).\n\nFor example, on 1 January 2002, the WEU's Security Studies Institute and the\nSatellite Centre were transferred to the EU and became the European Union\nInstitute for Security Studies and the European Union Satellite Centre.\nNotably, the role given to the WEU in the Amsterdam Treaty, was removed by the\nNice Treaty. The Treaty of Lisbon has provisions for cooperation between the\nEU and both NATO (including the Berlin Plus agreement) and the WEU. However\nthe defence commitment, of Article 4 of the Brussels Treaty, has not been\nsubsumed. Article 42(7) of the Treaty of the European Union, as amended by the\nTreaty of Lisbon, could be viewed as incorporating that defence commitment\ninto the EU framework.\n\nThe European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) and European Union\nSatellite Centre (EUSC), both established to function under the EU's CFSP\npillar, were both replacements to the _Western European Union Institute for\nSecurity Studies_ and the _Western Union Satellite Centre_ which had been\nestablished to function in connection to the WEU.\n\nWith the transfer of responsibilities, the WEU's Parliamentary assembly was\nurged to dissolve itself, as it had a mandate to supervise WEU politics, not\nthe EU's CSDP politics. But the Assembly saw itself as playing an important\nrole, particularly with greater right of scrutiny, membership, experience and\nexpertise in defence policy. Therefore, it renamed itself the \"Interim\nEuropean Security and Defence Assembly\" and urged the European Convention to\ninclude it as a second chamber within the EU's institutional framework. Hence\nit argued it could effectively scrutinise the CSDP, help improve EU-NATO\nrelations and be more suited, being composed of national parliamentarians, to\nthe intergovernmental style of the CSDP.\n\nHowever, with the European Constitution aiming to streamline and simplify the\nEU's foreign policy, for example combining the two main foreign policy posts,\nit was not seen as wise to then create a separate double legislature for the\nCFSP, instead, the European Parliament was granted greater scrutiny over\nforeign policy."

The Franco-British alliance established by the Dunkirk Treaty was _de facto_ superseded by WU. The CFSP pillar was bolstered by some of the security structures that had been established within the remit of the 1955 Modified Brussels Treaty (MBT). The Brussels Treaty was terminated in 2011, consequently dissolving the WEU, as the mutual defence clause that the Lisbon Treaty provided for EU was considered to render the WEU superfluous. The EU thus _de facto_ superseded the WEU.\n2. **^** Plans to establish a European Political Community (EPC) were shelved following the French failure to ratify the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (EDC). The EPC would have combined the ECSC and the EDC.\n3. **^** The European Communities obtained common institutions and a shared legal personality (i.e. ability to e.g. sign treaties in their own right).\n4. **^** The treaties of Maastricht and Rome form the EU's legal basis, and are also referred to as the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), respectively. They are amended by secondary treaties.\n5. **^** Between the EU's founding in 1993 and consolidation in 2009, the union consisted of three pillars, the first of which were the European Communities. The other two pillars consisted of additional areas of cooperation that had been added to the EU's remit.\n6. **^** The consolidation meant that the EU inherited the European Communities' legal personality and that the pillar system was abolished, resulting in the EU framework as such covering all policy areas. Executive/legislative power in each area was instead determined by a distribution of competencies between EU institutions and member states. This distribution, as well as treaty provisions for policy areas in which unanimity is required and qualified majority voting is possible, reflects the depth of EU integration as well as the EU's partly supranational and partly intergovernmental nature."
