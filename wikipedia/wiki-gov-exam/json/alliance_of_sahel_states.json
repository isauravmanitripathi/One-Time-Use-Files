Please do not remove this message until conditions to\ndo so are met. _( August 2025)__(Learn how and when to remove this message)_  \n---|---  \n  \nConfederation of Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso\n\nThe **Confederation of Sahel States** (French: _Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des \u00c9tats du\nSahel_), also known as the **Alliance of Sahel States** (French: _Alliance des\n\u00c9tats du Sahel_), or **AES Confederation** (**AES**) is a confederation formed\nbetween Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, located in the Sahel region of Africa.\nIt originated as a mutual defense pact created on 16 September 2023 following\nthe 2023 Nigerien crisis, in which the West African political bloc ECOWAS\nthreatened to intervene militarily following a successful coup d'\u00e9tat in Niger\nearlier that year. All three member states are former members of ECOWAS and\ncurrently under the control of juntas following a string of successful coups,\nthe 2021 Malian coup d'\u00e9tat, the September 2022 Burkina Faso coup d'\u00e9tat, and\nthe 2023 Niger coup d'\u00e9tat. The confederation was established on 6 July 2024.\n\nThe confederation's stated goal is to pool resources to build energy and\ncommunications infrastructure, establish a common market, implement a monetary\nunion under proposed currency, allow free movement of persons, enable\nindustrialization, and invest in agriculture, mines and the energy sector,\nwith the end goal of federalizing into a single sovereign state. The\nconfederation is against neo-colonialism and has demonstrated this with acts\nsuch as downgrading the status of the French language and renaming of colonial\nstreet names. It is also anti-French and anti-ECOWAS in outlook, as it\ndisagrees with many of their policies.\n\nThe economic outlook for AES countries is positive (Burkina 5.494%, Mali\n3.751%, and Niger 9.869% GDP growth in 2024), with Niger becoming the 3rd\nfastest growing economy in the world and the fastest growing economy in Africa\nin 2024. The nations of the AES are among the least developed in the world as\nmeasured by the Human Development Index. Factors such as prolonged periods of\nineffective governance, external geopolitical influences, jihadist groups, and\nimbalanced trade agreements that provided minimal infrastructure improvement\nor benefits to local populations, contributed to economic and social\nchallenges in these countries. By definition AES countries are considered\nundemocratic as their military governments came to power by coup. The UK-based\nNGO Amnesty International has accused AES governments of engaging in routine\nhuman rights violations including arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances,\nand massacres of civilians. AES states have all pledged to suspend military\nrule and return to civilian rule, but these plans have been delayed in each of\nthese countries as the governments work towards increased integration.\n\nA project to set up passport and identity card travel documents between the\nthree member countries of the AES is part of a more advanced integration\nbetween the member states before approval of the project by the three heads of\nstate of the member countries.\n\nWithin the territory of the AES, there are various terrorist and insurgent\ngroups including ISSP, Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, and various\nseparatist rebels fighting in Northern Mali such as the Azawad Movement. In\n2024, the AES cut off military relations with Western powers and replaced\nWestern military forces on their territory with Russian mercenaries,\nspecifically the Wagner Group. It has also cut diplomatic ties and expelled\nambassadors from some Western countries such as Sweden following critical\nstatements regarding its rapprochement with Russia."

All three member states have had their pro-Western\ncivilian governments overthrown by their militaries, and each is ruled by a\nmilitary junta as part of the Coup Belt. In 2022, Mali withdrew from the\ninternationally backed G5 Sahel alliance.

Go\u00efta later led a second coup in\n2021 which deposed the interim president Bah Ndaw who had been nominated to\nlead a transitional military government.\n\nJust months later, in the 2021 Guinean coup d'\u00e9tat, the National Committee of\nReconciliation and Development removed the elected president Alpha Cond\u00e9 and\ninstalled Mamady Doumbouya as transitional president. Guinea is not a member\nof the AES, but has been offering diplomatic support to the confederation.\n\nA faction of Burkina Faso's military overthrew their existing military\ngovernment in the September 2022 coup d'\u00e9tat, installing Ibrahim Traor\u00e9 over\nPaul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who had come to power in the January 2022 coup\nd'\u00e9tat which toppled the democratic government of president Roch Marc\nChristian Kabor\u00e9.\n\nIn July 2023, the National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland removed\nthe elected government of Niger's Mohamed Bazoum, installing Abdourahamane\nTchiani and a new junta in the 2023 coup d'\u00e9tat."

The juntas of Mali and Burkina Faso promised\nmilitary aid to Niger in the event of an intervention, while Guinea's provided\ndiplomatic support. The promises of military aid resulted in the creation of\nthe Alliance of Sahel States as a mutual defense bloc for the three nations,\nsuccessfully staving off an ECOWAS intervention. The West Africa Peoples\nOrganisation denounced the intervention, calling it a \"pretext to carry out\nimperialist plans to keep Niger (rich in mineral resources, notably uranium\nand hydrocarbons) continually in the imperialist fold.\"\n\nOn 28 January 2024, the three countries announced via a joint statement that\nthey were withdrawing from ECOWAS. With the situation at an impasse, later\nthat year ECOWAS appointed three mediators to begin dialogues with the AES\ncountries. Soon after, on 15 December 2024, the Conference of Heads of State\nof ECOWAS adopted an exit transition period for Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali,\nwhich begins on 29 January 2025, and ends on 29 July 2025.

For example, Niger is among the world's\nbiggest uranium exporters and for many years has been a major uranium exporter\nto the EU. Niger was among the top 4 providers of uranium to the EU in both\n2022 and 2023 according to the Supply Agency of the European Atomic Energy\nCommunity (Euratom). In 2022, Niger delivered 2,975 tonnes of natural uranium,\nor 25.4% of the EU's supplies, making it the second largest supplier. In 2023,\nshipments dropped by 29.78%, making Niger the 4th largest supplier to the EU.\nNiger produces just under 5% of all mined uranium worldwide.\n\nNiger was working to begin oil exports to China through the Niger\u2013Benin Oil\nPipeline until the efforts were frustrated in early 2024. China intervened in\nMay 2024, resulting in the resumption of crude oil exports via the Chinese-\nfunded pipeline. The pipeline was closed again after just one shipment of oil\ndue to damages after a terror attack.\n\nSome major known resources in AES territory include:\n\nCountry  | Natural Resources  | Other Resources\n---|---|---\nNiger  | uranium, coal, iron ore, tin, phosphates, gold, molybdenum, gypsum, salt, petroleum, copper, lithium  |\nBurkina Faso  | gold, manganese, zinc, limestone, marble, phosphates, pumice, salt, lithium, copper  | cotton\nMali  | gold, phosphates, kaolin, salt, limestone, uranium, gypsum, granite, hydropower, lithium  | cotton\n\nThe AES is renegotiating relationships with Western and Chinese companies to\nassert greater control over their resources and operations. French firms such\nas Orano, TotalEnergies, and Air France are navigating challenges, with Orano\nand TotalEnergies under scrutiny and Air France seeking to resume suspended\noperations. Canadian companies like GoviEX and Barrick Gold are impacted, as\nGoviEX has had its uranium licenses revoked in Niger, and Barrick Gold is\nrenegotiating terms in Mali. In 2025 some mining assets within the AES were\nnationalized to increase government ownership in industrial mines operated by\nforeign entities and to boost earnings from mineral wealth.\n\nChinese companies, including the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) and\nZijin Mining Group, are also facing challenges, with CNNC targeted for mining\ncontract renegotiations and Zijin Mining Group working to meet AES sovereignty\ngoals. In March 2025, Niger requested top local officials of China National\nPetroleum Corp, Zinder Refining Company and the West African Gas Pipeline\nCompany Ltd. (responsible for the construction and operation of the\nNiger\u2013Benin Oil Pipeline) depart the country due to contract issues.

This policy is compatible with both the African Union's\nAfrican Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the AES goals of regional\nintegration.\n\nOn 21 January 2025, Ghana appointed a special envoy to the Confederation of\nSahel States, Larry Gbevlo-Lartey, who was tasked with bridging Ghana's\nrelations with members of the Alliance of Sahel States."

A Malian drone was shot down\nnear the Algerian border on 31 March 2025. The AES has called the act a\nviolation of international law and \"proof\" of state-sponsored terrorism by\nAlgeria. Mali's Prime Minister denied Algerian claims that the drone had\nviolated Algerian airspace, adding that Mali would file a complaint with\ninternational bodies.\n\nMali has withdrawn its ambassador to Algeria over the issue, stating \"The\ndestruction of the drone has the effect, if not the aim of hindering the\nneutralization of armed groups that have claimed responsibility for terrorist\nacts.'\". This incident highlights rising tensions and a strained relationship\nbetween Algeria and the AES."

As part this realignment, the nations of the AES have\nbeen seeking new partnerships to fill the vacuum left by France's exit. This\nhas resulted in an intention to increase economic and security cooperation\nwith Russia, Turkey, China, Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan.\n\nRussian involvement notably includes a joint satellite program with\nRoscosmos,[_deprecated source?_] and military assistance from the Wagner Group\nto counter insurgencies.\n\nIn June 2025, Russia signed nuclear cooperation agreements with Burkina Faso\nand Mali for the peaceful use of atomic energy, infrastructure development,\nand energy security. The Burkina Faso\u2013Russia Agreement, Finalized during the\nSt Petersburg International Economic Forum, includes building a nuclear power\nplant, developing regulations, and training specialists. Rosatom also pledged\nscholarships and technical support, aiming to address Burkina Faso's severe\nelectricity shortage. In June 2025 only about 20% of Burkinabes had access to\npower. The Mali\u2013Russia Agreement, Signed during Assimi Goita\u2019s visit to\nRussia, includes nuclear infrastructure, safety regulations, training, and\napplications in medicine, agriculture, and industry. The agreement is expected\nto boost Mali's energy autonomy and reduce reliance on imports.\n\nTurkey's foreign, defense, and energy ministers met with their counterparts in\nNiger to discuss new deals in the areas of security and defense, trade,\nenergy, and mining on 17 July 2024 and had military contractors in Niger as of\nJanuary 2025. Iran and Niger signed a joint cooperation agreement during the\nthird meeting of their Joint Economic Committee on the sidelines of the Iran\nExpo 2025 in April 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali further distanced themselves from\nFrance by announcing their decisions to withdraw from the Organisation\nInternationale de la Francophonie (OIF), an international organization\nestablished in 1970 in Niamey, Niger, to promote the French language and\nencourage cooperation among French-speaking nations. Although the three AES\ncountries are founding members of the OIF, they were suspended from the\norganization following the coups that brought military leadership to power,\nand consider the organization \"a politically manipulated instrument\".\n\nThe AES has expressed strong opposition to Ukrainian support of rebels in the\nSahel after comments by Ukrainian officials in August 2024 stating they had\nsupported separatists that killed Malian soldiers. The AES has called on the\nUnited Nations to take action against Ukraine and accused Ukraine of\nsupporting terrorism in the Sahel. As a result, Mali and Niger have severed\ndiplomatic relations with Ukraine. In response, Sweden severed several million\nkronor worth of aid to Mali and cut diplomatic ties."
