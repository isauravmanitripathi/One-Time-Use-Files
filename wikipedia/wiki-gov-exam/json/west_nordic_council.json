        "generated_section_content_md": "The **West Nordic Council** (Danish: _Vestnordisk R\u00e5d_ , Greenlandic: _Nunat\nAvannarliit Killiit Siunnersuisoqatigiiffiat_ , Faroese: _\u00datnor\u00f0urr\u00e1\u00f0i\u00f0_ ,\nIcelandic: _Vestnorr\u00e6na r\u00e1\u00f0i\u00f0_) is a cooperative forum for the parliaments and\ngovernments of Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland. It was initially\nfounded in 1985 as the **West Nordic Parliamentarian Council of Cooperation**\nbut the name was changed in 1997. The council is composed of six MPs from each\nnation appointed by their respective parliaments. The annual general meeting\nof the council rotates between the members and is its highest authority. A\npresidium of three members, including the council's president, oversees the\norganization of its work and activities.\n\nThe nations of the Council share a somewhat common recent history: Greenland\nand the Faroes are autonomous territories of Denmark and Iceland is a former\nDanish possession. They also share a similar economic base, all being\ndependent on fisheries. The council's main objectives are:\n\n  * To promote West Nordic (North Atlantic) interests.\n  * To be guardians of north Atlantic resources and North Atlantic culture and to help to promote West Nordic interests through the West Nordic governments \u2013 not least with regards to the serious issues of resource management, pollution, etc.\n  * To follow up on the governments' West Nordic cooperation.\n  * To work with the Nordic Council and to be the West Nordic link in Nordic cooperation.\n  * To act as the parliamentary link for inter-West Nordic organisations, including Arctic parliamentary cooperation.\n\nThe West Nordic Council is separate from the Nordic Council, although all of\nthe members of the West Nordic Council are also members of the Nordic Council\nand there is some cooperation between the two."
