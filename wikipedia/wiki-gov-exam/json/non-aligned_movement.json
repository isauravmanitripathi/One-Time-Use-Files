        "generated_section_content_md": "Group of countries not in major power blocs\n\nThe **Non-Aligned Movement** (**NAM**) is a forum of 121 countries that are\nnot formally aligned with or against any major power bloc. It was founded with\nthe view to advancing interests of developing countries in the context of Cold\nWar confrontation. After the United Nations, it is the largest grouping of\nstates worldwide.\n\nThe movement originated in the aftermath of the Korean War, as an effort by\nsome countries to counterbalance the rapid bi-polarization of the world during\nthe Cold War, whereby two major powers formed blocs and embarked on a policy\nto pull the rest of the world into their orbits. One of these was the pro-\nSoviet socialist bloc whose best known alliance was the Warsaw Pact, and the\nother the pro-American capitalist group of countries, many of which belonged\nto NATO. In 1961, drawing on the principles agreed at the Bandung Conference\nof 1955, the Non-Aligned Movement was formally established in Belgrade,\nYugoslavia, through an initiative led by Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito,\nIndian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah,\nIndonesian president Sukarno, and United Arab Republic president Gamal Abdel\nNasser.\n\nThis led to the first Conference of Heads of State or Governments of Non-\nAligned Countries. The purpose of the organization was summarized by Fidel\nCastro in his Havana Declaration of 1979 as to ensure \"the national\nindependence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of non-aligned\ncountries\" in their \"struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-\ncolonialism, racism, and all forms of foreign aggression, occupation,\ndomination, interference or hegemony as well as against great power and bloc\npolitics.\"\n\nThe countries of the Non-Aligned Movement represent nearly two-thirds of the\nUnited Nations' members and contain 55% of the world population. Membership is\nparticularly concentrated in countries considered to be developing countries,\nalthough the Non-Aligned Movement also has a number of developed nations.\n\nThe Non-Aligned Movement gained the most traction in the 1950s and early\n1960s, when the international policy of non-alignment achieved major successes\nin decolonization, disarmament, opposition to racism and opposition to\napartheid in South Africa, and persisted throughout the entire Cold War,\ndespite several conflicts between members, and despite some members developing\ncloser ties with either the Soviet Union, China, or the United States. In the\nyears since the Cold War's end in 1991, the movement has focused on developing\nmultilateral ties and connections as well as unity among the developing\nnations of the world, especially those in the Global South."

Josip Broz Tito, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Gamal Abdel Nasser,\npioneers of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Brioni Meeting\n\nThe term 'Non-Alignment' was used for the first time in 1950 at the United\nNations by India and Yugoslavia, both of which refused to align themselves\nwith any side in the multi-alliances involving Korean War. Drawing on the\nprinciples agreed at the Bandung Conference in 1955, the Non-Aligned Movement\nas an organization was founded on the Brijuni islands in Yugoslavia in 1956\nand was formalized by signing the Declaration of Brijuni on 19 July 1956. The\nDeclaration was signed by Yugoslavia's president, Josip Broz Tito, India's\nprime minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Egypt's president, Gamal Abdel Nasser. One\nof the quotations within the Declaration is \"Peace can not be achieved with\nseparation, but with the aspiration towards collective security in global\nterms and expansion of freedom, as well as terminating the domination of one\ncountry over another\". According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, an ideologue of the\nCongress party which ruled India for most part of the Cold War years, the Non-\nAligned Movement arose from the desire of Jawaharlal Nehru and other leaders\nof the newly independent countries of the third world to guard their\nindependence and sovereignty \"in face of complex international situation\ndemanding allegiance to either two warring superpowers\".\n\nThe movement advocates a middle course for states in the developing world\nbetween the Western and Eastern Blocs during the Cold War. The phrase itself\nwas first used to represent the doctrine by Indian diplomat V. K. Krishna\nMenon in 1953, at the United Nations.[_unreliable source?_]\n\nBut it soon after became the name to refer to the participants of the\n_Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries_ first\nheld in 1961. The term \"non-alignment\" was established in 1953 at the United\nNations. Nehru used the phrase in a 1954 speech in Colombo, Sri Lanka. In this\nspeech, Zhou Enlai and Nehru described the Five Principles of Peaceful\nCoexistence to be used as a guide for Sino-Indian relations called\n_Panchsheel_ (five restraints); these principles would later serve as the\nbasis of the Non-Aligned Movement. The five principles were:\n\n* Mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n* Mutual non-aggression.\n* Mutual non-interference in domestic affairs.\n* Equality and mutual benefit.\n* Peaceful co-existence.\n\nA significant milestone in the development of the Non-Aligned Movement was the\n1955 Bandung Conference, a conference of Asian and African states hosted by\nIndonesian president Sukarno, who gave a significant boost to promote this\nmovement. Bringing together Sukarno, U Nu, Nasser, Nehru, Tito, Nkrumah and\nMenon with the likes of Ho Chi Minh, Zhou Enlai, and Norodom Sihanouk, as well\nas U Thant and a young Indira Gandhi, the conference adopted a \"declaration on\npromotion of world peace and cooperation\", which included Zhou Enlai and\nNehru's five principles, and a collective pledge to remain neutral in the Cold\nWar. Six years after Bandung, an initiative of Yugoslav president Josip Broz\nTito led to the first _Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-\nAligned Countries_ , which was held in September 1961 in Belgrade. The term\n_non-aligned movement_ appears first in the fifth conference in 1976, where\nparticipating countries are denoted as _members of the movement_.\n\nAt the Lusaka Conference in September 1970, the member nations added as aims\nof the movement the peaceful resolution of disputes and the abstention from\nthe big power military alliances and pacts. Another added aim was opposition\nto stationing of military bases in foreign countries.\n\nIn 1975, the member nations which also were part of the United Nations General\nAssembly pushed for the Resolution 3379 along with Arab countries and the\nsupport of the Soviet bloc. It was a declarative non-binding measure that\nequated Zionism with South Africa's Apartheid and as a form of racial\ndiscrimination. The bloc voting produced a majority in the United Nations that\nsystematically condemned Israel in the following resolutions: 3089, 3210,\n3236, 32/40, etc.\n\nSome Non-Aligned member nations were involved in serious conflicts with other\nmembers, notably India and Pakistan as well as Iran and Iraq."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the 1970s, Cuba made a major effort to assume a leadership role in the\nworld's non-alignment movement. The country established military advisory\nmissions and economic and social reform programs. The 1976 world conference of\nthe Non-Aligned Movement applauded Cuban internationalism, \"which assisted the\npeople of Angola in frustrating the expansionist and colonialist strategy of\nSouth Africa's racist regime and its allies.\" The next Non-Aligned conference\nwas scheduled for Havana in 1979, to be chaired by Fidel Castro, with his\nbecoming the de facto spokesman for the Movement. The conference in September\n1979 marked the zenith of Cuban prestige. Most, but not all, attendees\nbelieved that Cuba was not aligned with the Soviet camp in the Cold War.\n\nHowever, in December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan's civil\nwar. Up until that time, Afghanistan was also an active member of the Non-\nAligned Movement. At the United Nations, nonaligned members voted 56 to 9,\nwith 26 abstaining, to condemn the Soviet Union. Cuba voted against the\nresolution, in support of the USSR. It lost its nonaligned leadership and\nreputation after Castro, instead of becoming a high-profile spokesman for the\nmovement, remained quiet and inactive. More broadly the movement was deeply\nsplit over the Soviet\u2013Afghan War in 1979, as many members of the Non-Aligned\nMovement, particularly the predominantly Muslim states, condemned it."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev and Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro\nat the 18th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Baku on 25 October 2019\n\nWith the end of the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement transformed. The\nbreakup of Yugoslavia (a prominent founding member) in 1991\u20131992 also affected\nthe movement; the regular Ministerial Meeting of the Movement, held in New\nYork during the regular yearly session of the General Assembly of the United\nNations in 1992 suspended Yugoslavia's membership. The various successor\nstates of Yugoslavia have expressed little interest in membership, though\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia retain observer status.\nIndia, another founding member, appears to have downgraded its emphasis on the\nmovement.\n\nMembership applications from Bosnia and Herzegovina and from Costa Rica were\nrejected in 1995 and 1998 respectively. In 2004 Malta and Cyprus ceased to be\nmembers when they joined the European Union, as required. Azerbaijan and Fiji\nare the most recent entrants, both having joined the Movement in 2011.\nAzerbaijan and Belarus, which joined in 1998, remain the only members on the\ncontinent of Europe.\n\nSince the end of the Cold War, the Non-Aligned Movement has felt forced to\nredefine itself and to reinvent its purpose in the new world-system. A major\nquestion has been whether any of its foundational ideologies, principally\nnational independence, territorial integrity, and the struggle against\ncolonialism and imperialism, apply to contemporary issues. The movement has\nemphasized its principles of multilateralism, equality, and mutual non-\naggression in attempting to become a stronger voice for the Global South, and\nan instrument that can promote the needs of member-nations at the\ninternational level and strengthen their political leverage when negotiating\nwith developed nations. In its efforts to advance Southern interests, the\nmovement has stressed the importance of cooperation and unity amongst member\nstates. However, as in the past, cohesion remains a problem, since the size of\nthe organization and the divergence of agendas and allegiances present the\nongoing potential for fragmentation. While agreement on basic principles has\nbeen smooth, taking definitive action _vis-\u00e0-vis_ particular international\nissues has been rare, with the movement preferring to assert its criticism or\nsupport rather than to pass hard-line resolutions.\n\nThe movement continues to see a role for itself: in its view, the world's\npoorest nations remain exploited and marginalized, no longer by opposing\nsuperpowers, but rather in a uni-polar world, and it is Western hegemony and\nneo-colonialism that the movement has really re-aligned itself against. It\nopposes foreign occupation, interference in internal affairs and aggressive\nunilateral measures, but it has also shifted to focus on the socio-economic\nchallenges facing member states, especially the inequalities manifested by\nglobalization and the implications of neo-liberal policies. The Non-Aligned\nMovement has identified economic underdevelopment, poverty, and social\ninjustices as growing threats to peace and security.\n\nThe 16th NAM summit took place in Tehran, Iran, from 26 to 31 August 2012.\nAccording to the Teheran-based Mehr News Agency, representatives from over 150\ncountries were scheduled to attend. Attendance at the highest level included\n27 presidents, two kings and emirs, seven prime ministers, nine vice-\npresidents, two parliamentary spokesmen and five special envoys. At the\nsummit, Iran took over from Egypt as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement for the\nperiod 2012 to 2015.\n\nIn 2016 Venezuela hosted the 17th NAM Summit.\n\nAzerbaijan, host of the 18th NAM summit in 2019, holds the Non-Aligned\nMovement presidency pending the 19th NAM summit, which took place in Kampala,\nUganda in January 2024."

Consisting of many governments with vastly different\nideologies, the Non-Aligned Movement is unified by its declared commitment to\nworld peace and security. At the seventh summit held in New Delhi in March\n1983, the movement described itself as \"history's biggest peace movement\". The\nmovement places equal emphasis on disarmament. NAM's commitment to peace pre-\ndates its formal institutionalization in 1961. The Brioni meeting between\nheads of governments of India, Egypt and Yugoslavia in 1956 recognized that\nthere exists a vital link between struggle for peace and endeavours for\ndisarmament.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, the NAM also sponsored campaigns for\nrestructuring commercial relations between developed and developing nations,\nnamely the New International Economic Order (NIEO), and its cultural\noffspring, the New World Information and Communication Order (NWICO). The\nlatter, on its own, sparked a Non-Aligned initiative on cooperation for\ncommunications, the Non-Aligned News Agencies Pool, created in 1975 and later\nconverted into the NAM News Network in 2005.\n\nThe Non-Aligned Movement espouses policies and practices of cooperation,\nespecially those that are multilateral and provide mutual benefit to all those\ninvolved. Almost all of the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are also\nmembers of the United Nations. Both organizations have a stated policy of\npeaceful cooperation, yet the successes the NAM has had with multilateral\nagreements tend to be ignored by the larger, western- and developed- nation-\ndominated UN. African concerns about apartheid were linked with Arab-Asian\nconcerns about Palestine and multilateral cooperation in these areas has\nenjoyed moderate success. The Non-Aligned Movement has played a major role in\nvarious ideological conflicts throughout its existence, including extreme\nopposition to apartheid governments and support of guerrilla movements in\nvarious locations, including Rhodesia and South Africa."

Some\nare specialists, such as the meeting on \"Inter-Faith Dialogue and Co-operation\nfor Peace\", held in Manila, the Philippines, 16\u201318 March 2010. There is a\ngeneral Conference of Foreign Ministers every three years. The most recent\nwere in Bali, Indonesia, 23\u201327 May 2011 and Algiers, Algeria, 26\u201329 May 2014.\n\nThe 7th Summit was originally planned for September 1982 in Baghdad, the Iraqi\ncapital, during the Iran-Iraq War. On 21 July of that year, the Islamic\nRepublic of Iran Air Force executed the \"Baghdad Operation\", an effort to\ndisrupt that proposal by showing Baghdad's airspace was unsafe. Two McDonnell\nDouglas F-4 Phantom II planes bombarded Al-Dura refinery with Mk82 bombs. One\nplane returned damaged and the other (along with its pilot) was lost to Iraqi\ndefensive fire. Combined with threats by an Iranian-backed terror group to\nkill the visiting heads of state, the effort was successful. On 11 August,\nIraqi President Saddam Hussein announced that he would support Cuba's\nsuggestion of a summit in New Delhi to be held in 1983. \"Iraq will take part\nin the conference even if held in Tehran... We propose that the seventh\nconference be held in India.\"\n\nThe Non-Aligned Movement celebrated its 50th anniversary in Belgrade on 5\u20136\nSeptember 2011.\n\nAn online summit titled \"United Against Covid-19\" conducted on 4 May 2020, on\nthe initiative of the chairman of the NAM for the 2019\u20132022 period, addressed\nmainly the global struggle to fight the COVID-19 pandemics and supporting NAM\nto increase its role in dealing with and mitigating the outcomes caused by\nthis disease in NAM, as well as other countries.\n\nThe Non-Aligned Movement celebrated its 60th anniversary in Belgrade, on 11\u201312\nOctober 2021."
