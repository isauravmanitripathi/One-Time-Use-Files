        "generated_section_content_md": "International Council for the Exploration of the Sea with President Walter\nArcher\n\nIn the late 19th century, a growing concern over the well-being of fish stocks\nin the North Sea coupled with efforts by different groups of scientists in\nneighboring countries to promote and encourage international scientific marine\ncooperation resulted in the establishment of ICES on July 22, 1902. The new\norganization was created in Copenhagen, Denmark by eight founding nations:\nDenmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the\nUnited Kingdom. The council's membership has fluctuated over the years with\nnations joining/leaving/rejoining at different times as a result of wars and\npolitical decisions.\n\nAn exchange of letters among the original eight member nations was sufficient\nto establish the council in 1902. This type of arrangement continued until the\nearly 1960s when this informal status became unacceptable in light of the\nestablishment of the United Nations and its subsidiary bodies as well as other\ninternational organizations. Steps were initiated to achieve full\ninternational recognition of the council by the host country, Denmark. At a\nconference convened in Copenhagen on September 7, 1964, a formal convention\nwas signed which subsequently came into force on July 22, 1968, following its\nratification by the then 17 member nations.\n\nICES today has 20 member nations, including the eight original members plus\ntwelve additional nations: Belgium, Canada, Estonia, France, Iceland, Ireland,\nLatvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and the United States. It also has\naffiliate institutes with observer status from: Australia, Chile, Greece,\nPeru, and South Africa. Formal observer status has been given to two non-\ngovernmental organizations: Worldwide Fund for Nature and Birdlife\nInternational."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The principal decision and policy-making body of ICES is the council. The\ncouncil consists of a president and two delegates from each of the 20 member\nnations. Delegates elect the president, first vice-president, and five\nadditional vice-presidents (all for three-year terms) to comprise the bureau\nor executive committee. The bureau is responsible for carrying out the\ncouncil's decisions, preparing and convening council meetings, formulating\ncouncil budgets, appointing a secretariat staff, and performing other tasks as\nassigned by the council. A finance committee consisting of five delegates\nprovides oversight to the council's fiscal matters. Delegates are also\nresponsible for appointing a general secretary, who serves as the council's\nchief executive officer and is charged with managing the council's secretariat\nfacilities and staff, finances, meetings, reports, publications, and\ncommunications.\n\nThe council's scientific work is accomplished by various committees and\nworking groups. During the long history of ICES, the committee and working\ngroup structure has changed periodically to reflect the needs of the time. At\npresent, there is an advisory committee (ACOM) that provides advice to clients\non fisheries and marine ecosystem issues, a Science Committee (SCICOM;\nformally the Consultative Committee as established in the ICES Convention)\nthat oversees all aspects of the scientific work, and steering groups that\ncoordinate the more than 100 expert groups covering most aspects of the marine\necosystem that work under them.\n\nA recently prepared strategic plan focuses on science that is broad-based,\nrelevant, and farsighted, and providing advice that is rigorous, reliable, and\nobjective. The plan identifies a mission which calls for 1) establishing\neffective arrangements to provide scientific advice; 2) informing interested\nparties and the public objectively and effectively about marine ecosystem\nissues; 3) coordinating and enhancing physical, chemical, biological, and\ninterdisciplinary research; 4) fostering partnerships with other organizations\nthat share a common interest; and 5) developing and maintaining accessible\nmarine databases. The strategic plan addresses six critical themes: 1)\nScience, 2) Collaboration, 3) Advice, 4) Data, 5) Communication, and 6)\nService support. An action plan specifies the activities that will be\nundertaken over the coming years in order to achieve the goals. It explains\nhow ICES will continue to advance scientific knowledge and improve scientific\nadvice, whereas the goals in the strategic plan tell what the overall\nobjectives will be."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The scientific work of ICES is done by a community of more than 1600 marine\nscientists from research institutes and universities in member and affiliate\nnations collaborating to gather information about the marine ecosystem, fill\ngaps in existing knowledge, and develop unbiased, non-political advice in\naddressing terms of reference developed each year by the advisory and science\ncommittees at the week-long ICES Annual Science Conference (ASC). The reports\nof the expert groups are presented at the ASCs and made available on the ICES\nwebsite. Some groups produce special reports, such as \u201cICES Report on Ocean\nClimate\u201d or \u201cICES Zooplankton Status Report\u201d, that are published in the ICES\nCooperative Research Report series.\n\nThe ASC (formerly called the Statutory Meeting), held every year in September,\ngenerally attracts 500\u2013700 scientists from around the world. The programme\nfeatures plenary lectures by noted scientists, theme sessions of contributed\npapers addressing timely multidisciplinary topics, and poster sessions. In\naddition, meetings of the Committees, Bureau, and Council are held to conduct\nthe necessary business of the organization.\n\nDuring the year, meetings of the more than 100 expert groups and workshops are\nheld either at ICES headquarters in Copenhagen or at venues in member (and\noccasionally affiliate) nations to address terms of reference developed at the\nprevious ASC.\n\nSymposia are an important part of the ICES work programme, not least because\nthey foster the broadening of the diversity of scientists who participate in\nICES activities. ICES welcomes proposals for stimulating symposia on topics\nthat are fundamental to the science components of the ICES Strategic Plan\nincluding (a) understanding the physical, chemical, and biological functioning\nof marine ecosystems, (b) understanding and quantifying human impacts on\nmarine ecosystems, including living marine resources, and (c) evaluating\noptions for sustainable marine-related industries, particularly fishing and\nmariculture. ICES generally sponsors, either itself or in collaboration with\nother organizations, at least two, and sometimes as many as seven or eight,\nscientific symposia in a calendar year.\n\nThe ICES Recognition Programme honours individuals whose contributions have\nimproved ICES and the community of scientists associated with it, advanced\nmarine science, and/or exemplify the objective application of ICES scientific\ninformation to societal decisions concerning the sustainable use of marine\necosystems. The Programme consists of four awards:\n\n* Outstanding Achievement Award recognizes a sustained, outstanding performance and exceptional contribution by a member of the ICES community whose career has been distinguished by a sustained commitment to excellence in such endeavours as science and research, and leadership.\n* Prix d\u2019Excellence Award recognizes the highest level of contribution to the ICES vision of \u201cAn international scientific community that is relevant, responsive, sound, and credible, concerning marine ecosystems and their relation to humanity\u201d.\n* Merit Awards give formal recognition to the best research paper and poster given at the Annual Science Conference, and to the best up-and-coming new scientist making a presentation at the Annual Science Conference.\n* Service Awards recognize the achievements and contributions of outgoing chairs of expert groups, science and advisory groups, and conveners of Annual Science Conference theme sessions and ICES symposia which further the objectives of ICES."
