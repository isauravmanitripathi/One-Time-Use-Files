It was established by Maurice Strong, its first director, after the\nUnited Nations Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm in June 1972.\nIts mandate is to provide leadership, deliver science and develop solutions on\na wide range of issues, including climate change, the management of marine and\nterrestrial ecosystems, and green economic development. The organization also\ndevelops international environmental agreements; publishes and promotes\nenvironmental science and helps national governments achieve environmental\ntargets.\n\nAs a member of the United Nations Development Group, UNEP aims to help the\nworld meet the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. UNEP hosts the secretariats\nof several multilateral environmental agreements and research bodies,\nincluding The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), The Minamata\nConvention on Mercury, The Basel, Rotterdam and Stockholm Conventions, The\nConvention on Migratory Species and The Convention on International Trade in\nEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), among others.\n\nIn 1988, the World Meteorological Organization and UNEP established the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). UNEP is also one of several\nImplementing Agencies for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the\nMultilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol. UNEP\nsometimes uses the alternative name UN Environment. The headquarters of the\nagency is in Nairobi, Kenya."

        "generated_section_content_md": "UNEP Conference on Ozone Layer in The Hague, 1988\n\nIn the 1970s, the need for environmental governance at a global level was not\nuniversally accepted, particularly by developing nations. Some argued that\nenvironmental concerns were not a priority for nations in poverty. The\nleadership of Canadian diplomat Maurice Strong convinced many of the\ndeveloping nations' governments that they needed to prioritize this issue. In\nthe words of Nigerian professor Adebayo Adedeji: \"Mr. Strong, through the\nsincerity of his advocacy, soon made it clear that all of us, irrespective of\nthe stage of our development, have a large stake in the matter.\"\n\nAfter developing organizations such as the International Labour Organization,\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization, the\n1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment (the Stockholm\nConference) was convened. In this conference various topics were discussed\nsuch as pollution, marine life, protection of resources, environmental change,\nand disasters relating to natural and biological change. This conference\nresulted in a _Declaration on the Human Environment_ (Stockholm Declaration)\nand the establishment of an environmental management body, which was later\nnamed the **United Nations Environment Program** (UNEP). UNEP was established\nby General Assembly Resolution 2997. Headquarters were established in Nairobi,\nKenya, with a staff of 300, including 100 professionals in a variety of\nfields, and with a five-year fund of more than US$100 million. At the time,\nUS$40 million were pledged by the United States and the remainder by 50 other\nnations. The 'Voluntary Indicative Scale of Contribution' established in 2002\nhas the role to increase the supporters of the UNEP. The finances related to\nall programs of UNEP is voluntarily contributed by Member states of the United\nNations. The Environmental Fund, which all nations of UNEP invest in, is the\ncore source of UNEP's programs. Between 1974 and 1986 UNEP produced more than\n200 technical guidelines or manuals on environment including forest and water\nmanagement, pest control, pollution monitoring, the relationship between\nchemical use and health, and management of industry.\n\nThe location of the headquarters proved to be a major controversy, with\ndeveloped countries preferring Geneva, where several other UN offices are\nbased, while developing countries preferred Nairobi, as that would be the\nfirst international organization headquartered in the Global South. At first,\nMexico City, New Delhi, and Cairo were also competing to be the headquarters,\nbut they pulled out to support Nairobi. Many of the developing countries were\n\"not particularly supportive of creating a new formal institution for\nenvironmental governance\", but supported its creation as an act of \"Southern\nsolidarity\".\n\nIn 2000, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, based in Cambridge and\nsponsored by IUCN, became part of UNEP."

Science Division: aims to provide scientifically credible environmental assessments and information for sustainable development. It reports on the state of the global environment, assesses policies, and aims to provide an early warning of emerging environmental threats. It is responsible for the monitoring and reporting of the environment regarding the 2030 Agenda and Sustainable Development Goals.\n2. Policy and Programme Division: makes the policy and programme of the UNEP. This division ensures other divisions are coordinated.\n3. Ecosystems Division: supports countries in conserving, restoring and managing their ecosystems. It addresses the environmental causes and consequences of disasters and conflicts. It helps countries reduce pollution from land-based activities, increase resilience to climate change, and think about the environment in their development planning.\n4. Economy Division: assists large businesses in their efforts to be more environmentally conscious. It has three main branches: Chemicals and Health, Energy and Climate, and Resources and Markets.\n5. Governance Affairs Office: engages member states and other relevant groups to use UNEP's work. The office serves UNEP's governing body, the United Nations Environment Assembly, and its subsidiary organ, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, and manages their meetings. It helps strengthen the visibility, authority and impact of the Assembly as an authoritative voice on the environment.\n6. Law Division: helps to develop environmental law. Works with countries to combat environmental crime and meet international environmental commitments. The law division aims to improve cooperation between lawmakers around the world who are making environmental laws.\n7. Communication Division: develops and disseminates UNEP's messages. It delivers them to governments and individuals through digital and traditional media channels.\n8. Corporate Services Division: handles UNEP's corporate interests such as management and exposure to financial risk."
