It is a forum\nwhose member countries describe themselves as committed to democracy and the\nmarket economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seek\nanswers to common problems, identify good practices, and coordinate domestic\nand international policies of its members.\n\nThe majority of OECD members are generally regarded as developed countries,\nwith high-income economies, and a very high Human Development Index.\n\nAs of 2024[update] their collective population is 1.38 billion people with an\naverage life expectancy of 80 years and a median age of 40, against a global\naverage of 30. As of 2017[update], OECD Member countries collectively\ncomprised 62.2% of global nominal GDP (USD 49.6 trillion) and 42.8% of global\nGDP (Int$54.2 trillion) at purchasing power parity. The OECD is an official\nUnited Nations observer. OECD nations have strong social security systems;\ntheir average social welfare spending stood at roughly 21% of GDP.\n\nThe OECD's headquarters are at the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette in Paris, France,\nwhich housed its predecessor organisation, the Organization for European\nEconomic Co-operation. The OECD is funded by contributions from member\ncountries at varying rates and is recognised as a highly influential publisher\nof mostly economic data through publications as well as annual evaluations and\nrankings of member countries."

Only Western European states were members of the OEEC,\nwhose primary function was the allocation of American aid. Its Secretaries-\nGeneral were the Frenchmen Robert Marjolin (1948\u20131955) and Ren\u00e9 Sergent\n(1955\u20131960). It was headquartered in the Ch\u00e2teau de la Muette in Paris.\n\nFollowing the end of Marshall aid in 1952, the OEEC focused on economic\nissues. Its coordinating role was challenged after the 1957 Rome Treaties\nestablishing the European Economic Community and Euratom. The OEEC provided a\nframework for negotiations aimed at setting up a European Free Trade Area, to\nbring the EEC's Inner Six and other OEEC members together on a multilateral\nbasis. In 1958, a European Nuclear Energy Agency was set up in response to\nEuratom.\n\nBy this time, some leading countries felt that the OEEC had outlived its\npurpose but could be adapted to fulfil a more global mission, which proved to\nbe a cumbersome task. Following several (occasionally unruly) meetings at the\nHotel Majestic in Paris, which began in January 1960, a resolution was reached\nto create a body that would not only solve European and Atlantic economic\nissues, but also devise policies that could assist less developed countries.\nThis reconstituted organisation would bring the US and Canada, who were\nalready OEEC observers, on board as full members, and the OEEC would set to\nwork straight away on convincing Japan to join the organisation."

This model is\naccompanied by a set of commentaries that reflect OECD-level interpretation of\nthe content of the model convention provisions. In general, this model\nallocates the primary right to tax to the country from which capital\ninvestment originates (i.e., the home, or resident country) rather than the\ncountry in which the investment is made (the host, or source country). As a\nresult, it is most effective between two countries with reciprocal investment\nflows (such as among the OECD member countries), but can be unbalanced when\none of the signatory countries is economically weaker than the other (such as\nbetween OECD and non-OECD pairings). Additionally, the OECD has published and\nupdated the Transfer Pricing Guidelines since 1995. The Transfer Pricing\nGuidelines serve as a template for the profit allocation of inter-company\ntransactions to countries. The latest version, of July 2017, incorporates the\napproved Actions developed under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)\nproject initiated by the G20.[_citation needed_]\n\n**Pillar 1**\n\nAn OECD proposal to allocate multinational profits (for taxing purposes) to countries where they do business, by a formula, including to markets which multinationals sell into without a physical presence. This is hoped to eliminate the need for Digital Services Tax implemented by several countries, including France. There are exclusions and minimum thresholds, including banking and extractive industries. The proposal involves allocating only residual profit (i.e., profits above what is established through transfer pricing, thus creating a hybrid mechanism). This is essentially no change to what is currently allowed (routine profits allocated using transfer pricing + residual profits allocated through profit split).\n\n**Pillar 2**\n\nOn 1 July 2021, finance officials from 130 countries agreed on plans for a new international taxation policy known as the global minimum corporate tax (of 15%). If a country taxes a multinational at a lower rate, the multinational's HQ will receive the difference.\n\nIt is not certain when the proposals will be implemented.\n\nAll the major economies agreed to pass national laws that would require\ncorporations to pay at least 15% income tax in the countries they operate.\nThis new policy would end the practice of locating world headquarters in small\ncountries with very low taxation rates. Governments hope to recoup some of the\nlost revenue, estimated at $100 billion to $240 billion each year. The new\nsystem was promoted by the Biden Administration in the United States and the\nOECD. Secretary-General Mathias Cormann of the OECD said, \"This historic\npackage will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of\ntax everywhere.\""
