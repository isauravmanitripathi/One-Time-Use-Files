Its headquarters is in Rome, Italy, and it maintains regional and field\noffices worldwide, operating in over 130 countries. It helps governments and\ndevelopment agencies coordinate their activities to improve and develop\nagriculture, forestry, fisheries, and land and water resources. It also\nconducts research, provides technical assistance to projects, operates\neducational and training programs, and collects agricultural output,\nproduction, and development data.\n\nThe FAO is governed by a biennial conference representing each member country\nand the EU, which elects a 49-member executive council.

        "generated_section_content_md": "The idea of an international organization for food and agriculture emerged in\nthe late 19th and early 20th century, advanced primarily by Polish-born\nAmerican agriculturalist and activist David Lubin. In May\u2013June 1905, an\ninternational conference was held in Rome, Italy, which led to the creation of\nthe International Institute of Agriculture (IIA) by the King of Italy, Victor\nEmmanuel III.\n\nThe IIA was the first intergovernmental organization to deal with the problems\nand challenges of agriculture on a global scale. It worked primarily to\ncollect, compile, and publish data on agriculture, ranging from output\nstatistics to a catalog of crop diseases. Among its achievements was the\npublication of the first agricultural census in 1930.\n\nWorld War II effectively ended the IIA. During the war, in 1943, United States\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt called a League of Nations Conference on Food\nand Agriculture, which brought representatives from forty-four governments to\nThe Omni Homestead Resort in Hot Springs, Virginia, from 18 May to 3 June to\nattend the Hot Springs Conference. The main impetus for the conference was the\nBritish-born Australian economist Frank L. McDougall, who since 1935 had\nadvocated for an international forum to address hunger and malnutrition.\n\nThe Conference ended with a commitment to establish a permanent organization\nfor food and agriculture, which was achieved on 16 October 1945 in Quebec\nCity, Canada, following the Constitution of the Food and Agriculture\nOrganization. The first session of the FAO Conference began the same day in\nthe Ch\u00e2teau Frontenac in Quebec City and ended on 1 November 1945. This was\nled by Sir John Boyd Orr where his work on ending world hunger and creation of\nFAO resulted in him winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1949.\n\nAfter the war, the IIA was officially dissolved by resolution of its Permanent\nCommittee on 27 February 1948. Its functions, facilities, and mandate were\nthen transferred to the newly established FAO, which maintained its\nheadquarters in Rome.\n\nThe FAO's initial functions supported agricultural and nutrition research and\nprovided technical assistance to member countries to boost production in\nagriculture, fishery, and forestry. Beginning in the 1960s, it focused on\nefforts to develop high-yield strains of grain, eliminate protein deficiency,\npromote rural employment, and increase agricultural exports. The FAO\nrecognized the decrease of these resources as an urgent problem in 1961 and\ncreated a joint collaboration with the International Biological Program (IBP)\nin 1967. To that end, it joined the UN General Assembly in creating the UN\nWorld Food Programme, the largest humanitarian organization addressing hunger\nand promoting food security.\n\nFAO Commemorative 1998 30th Anniv MM Programme Bronze Obverse\n\nThe FAO launched what would become the FAO Money and Medals Programme (MMP) in\n1968. FAO issued collector art medals in various series to bring attention to\nFAO's goals and missions. This program was responsible for over a hundred\nmedal designs issued to the collecting public. A thirtieth anniversary medal\nof the MMP was issued in 1998.\n\nIn 1974, in response to famine in Africa, the FAO convened the first World\nFood Summit to address widespread hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity.\nThe meeting resulted in a proclamation that \"every man, woman, and child has\nthe inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition to develop their\nphysical and mental faculties\" and a global commitment to eradicate these\nissues within a decade. A subsequent summit in 1996 addressed the shortcomings\nin achieving this goal while establishing a strategic plan for eliminating\nhunger and malnutrition into the 21st century.\n\nEvery year, FAO publishes a number of major 'State of the World' reports\nrelated to food, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and natural resources."

It builds on the success in 2010 of The 1billonhungry project and\nthe subsequent chain of public events that led to the collection of over three\nmillion signatures on a global petition to end hunger (www.EndingHunger.org).\nThe petition was originally presented to representatives of world governments\nat a ceremony in Rome on 30 November 2010.\n\nThe web and partnerships are two pivotal and dynamic aspects of EndingHunger.\nThe campaign relies on the assistance of organizations and institutions that\ncan facilitate the project's diffusion, by placing banners on their own\nwebsites or organizing events aimed to raise awareness of the project. In its\n2011 season, the campaign expanded its multimedia content, pursued mutual\nvisibility arrangements with partner organizations, and sharpened its focus on\n14- to 25-year-olds, who were encouraged to understand their potential as a\nsocial movement to push for the end of hunger.\n\nMoreover, the EndingHunger project is a viral communication campaign, renewing\nand expanding its efforts to build the movement through Facebook, Twitter and\nother social networks. Those who sign the petition can spread the link of the\nEndingHunger website to their friends, via social media or mail, in order to\ngain awareness and signatures for the petition. The next interim objective is\nto grow the EndingHunger movement's Facebook community to 1 million members.\nAs with the petition, the more people who get involved, the more powerful the\nmessage to governments: \"We are no longer willing to accept the fact that\nhundreds of millions live in chronic hunger.\" Groups and individuals can also\ndecide on their own to organize an event about the project, simply by\ngathering friends, whistles, T-shirts and banners (whistles and T-shirts can\nbe ordered, and petition sign sheets downloaded, on the endinghunger.org\nwebsite) and thereby alert people about chronic hunger by using the yellow\nwhistle.\n\nThe original 1billionhungry campaign borrowed as its slogan the line \"I'm as\nmad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!\", used by Peter Finch in\nthe 1976 film, _Network_. Meanwhile, the yellow whistle has been the campaign\nsymbol from the start, from 1billionhungry to Ending Hunger. (The creative\nconcept was provided by the McCann Erickson Italy Communication Agency.) It\nsymbolizes the fact that we are \"blowing the whistle\" on the silent disaster\nof hunger. It is both a symbol and \u2013 at many live events taking place around\nthe world \u2013 a physical means of expressing frustration and making some noise\nabout the hunger situation.\n\nBoth The 1billionhungry and the EndingHunger campaigns have continued to\nattract UN Goodwill Ambassadors from the worlds of music and cinema,\nliterature, sport, activism and government. Some of the well known individuals\nwho have become involved include former Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula\nda Silva, former presidents of Chile Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet,\nactress Susan Sarandon, actors Jeremy Irons and Raul Bova, singers C\u00e9line Dion\nand Anggun, authors Isabelle Allende and Andrea Camilleri, musician Chucho\nVald\u00e9s and Olympic track-and-field legend Carl Lewis."

        "generated_section_content_md": "There has been public criticism of FAO for at least 30 years. Dissatisfaction\nwith the organization's performance was among the reasons for the creation of\ntwo new organizations after the World Food Conference in 1974, namely the\nWorld Food Council and the International Fund for Agricultural Development; by\nthe early eighties there was intense rivalry among these organizations. At the\nsame time, the World Food Programme, which started as an experimental three-\nyear programme under FAO, was growing in size and independence, with the\nDirectors of FAO and WFP struggling for power.\n\nEarly in 1989, the organization came under attack from Heritage Foundation, an\nAmerican conservative think tank, which described the FAO as becoming\n\"essentially irrelevant in combating hunger\" due to a \"bloated bureaucracy\nknown for the mediocrity of its work and the inefficiency of its staff\", which\nhad become politicized. In September of the same year, the journal _Society_\npublished a series of articles about FAO that included a contribution from the\nHeritage Foundation and a response by FAO staff member, Richard Lydiker, who\nwas later described by the Danish Minister for Agriculture (who had herself\nresigned from the organization) as \"FAO's chief spokesman for non-\ntransparency\".\n\nIn 1990, the U.S. State Department expressed the view that \"The Food and\nAgriculture Organization has lagged behind other UN organizations in\nresponding to US desires for improvements in program and budget processes to\nenhance value for money spent\".\n\nA year later, in 1991, _The Ecologist_ magazine produced a special issue under\nthe heading \"The UN Food and Agriculture Organization: Promoting World\nHunger\". The magazine included articles that questioned FAO's policies and\npractices in forestry, fisheries, aquaculture, and pest control. The articles\nwere written by experts such as Helena Norberg-Hodge, Vandana Shiva, Edward\nGoldsmith, Miguel A. Altieri and Barbara Dinham."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The 2002 Food Summit organized by FAO was considered to have been ineffectual\nand unproductive by the official participants. Social movements, farmers,\nfisherfolk, pastoralists, indigenous peoples, environmentalists, women's\norganizations, trade unions and NGOs expressed their \"collective\ndisappointment in, and rejection of the official Declaration of the ...\nSummit\".\n\nIn 2004, FAO produced a controversial report called \"Agricultural\nBiotechnology: meeting the needs of the poor?\", which claimed that\n\"agricultural biotechnology has real potential as a new tool in the war on\nhunger\". In response to the report, more than 650 organizations from around\nthe world signed an open letter in which they said \"FAO has broken its\ncommitment to civil society and peasants' organisations\". The letter\ncomplained that organizations representing the interests of farmers had not\nbeen consulted, that FAO was siding with the biotechnology industry and,\nconsequently, that the report \"raises serious questions about the independence\nand intellectual integrity of an important United Nations agency\". Jacques\nDiouf, the Director General of FAO at that time, responded immediately,\nstating that decisions on biotechnology must \"be taken at the international\nlevel by competent bodies\" (in other words, not by non-governmental\norganizations). He acknowledged, however, that \"biotechnology research is\nessentially driven by the world's top ten transnational corporations\" and \"the\nprivate sector protects its results with patents in order to earn from its\ninvestment and it concentrates on products that have no relevance to food in\ndeveloping countries\".\n\nIn May 2006, a British newspaper published the resignation letter of Louise\nFresco, one of eight Assistant Directors-General of FAO. In her letter, Fresco\nstated that \"the Organization has been unable to adapt to a new era\", that its\n\"contribution and reputation have declined steadily\" and \"its leadership has\nnot proposed bold options to overcome this crisis\".\n\nThe 32nd Session of FAO's Committee on World Food Security in 2006, attended\nby 120 countries, was widely criticized by non-governmental organizations, but\nlargely ignored by the mainstream media. Oxfam called for an end to the talk-\nfests while Via Campesina issued a statement that criticised FAO's policy of\nFood Security.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, the final report of an Independent External Evaluation of\nFAO was published. More than 400 pages in length, the evaluation was the first\nof its kind in the history of the Organization. It had been commissioned by\ndecision of the 33rd Session of the FAO Conference in November 2005. The\nreport concluded that \"The Organization is today in a financial and programme\ncrisis\" but \"the problems affecting the Organization today can all be solved\".\nAmong the problems noted by the IEE were: \"The Organization has been\nconservative and slow to adapt\"; \"FAO currently has a heavy and costly\nbureaucracy\", and \"The capacity of the Organization is declining and many of\nits core competencies are now imperilled\". Among the solutions offered were:\n\"A new Strategic Framework\", \"institutional culture change and reform of\nadministrative and management systems\". In conclusion the IEE stated that, \"If\nFAO did not exist it would need to be invented\".\n\nThe official response from FAO came on 29 October 2007. It indicated that\nmanagement supported the principal conclusion in the report of the IEE on the\nneed for \"reform with growth\" so as to have an FAO \"fit for this century\".\nMeanwhile, hundreds of FAO staff signed a petition in support of the IEE\nrecommendations, calling for \"a radical shift in management culture and\nspirit, depoliticization of appointments, restoration of trust between staff\nand management, [and] setting strategic priorities of the organization\".\n\nIn May 2008, while talking about the ongoing world food crisis, President\nAbdoulaye Wade of Senegal expressed the opinion that FAO was \"a waste of\nmoney\" and that \"we must scrap it\". Wade said that FAO was itself largely to\nblame for the price rises, and that the organization's work was duplicated by\nother bodies that operated more efficiently, like the UN's International Fund\nfor Agricultural Development. However, this criticism may have had more to do\nwith personal animosity between the President and the Director-General,\nhimself a Senegalese, particularly in light of the significant differences in\nthe work carried out by the two organizations.\n\nIn June 2008, the FAO sponsored the High-Level Conference on World Food\nSecurity. The summit was notable for the lack of agreement over the issue of\nbiofuels. The response to the summit among non-governmental organizations was\nmixed, with Oxfam stating that \"the summit in Rome was an important first step\nin tackling the food crisis but greater action is now needed\", while Maryam\nRahmanian of Iran's Centre for Sustainable Development said \"We are dismayed\nand disgusted to see the food crisis used to further the policies that have\nled us to the food crisis in the first place\". As with previous food summits,\ncivil society organizations held a parallel meeting and issued their own\ndeclaration to \"reject the corporate industrial and energy-intensive model of\nproduction and consumption that is the basis of continuing crises.\"\n\nIn November 2008, a Special Conference of FAO member countries agreed a\nUS$42.6 million (\u20ac38.6 million), three-year Immediate Plan of Action for\n\"reform with growth\", as recommended by the IEE. Under the plan US$21.8\nmillion would be spent on overhauling the financial procedures, hierarchies\nand human resources management."

        "generated_section_content_md": "From 2013, an English-language newspaper based in Rome, _The Italian Insider_\n, made several allegations of nepotism and corruption within FAO and reported\non poor management-staff relations. In June 2018, FAO and four of its\nofficials took the paper and its editor, John Philips, to court alleging\ndefamation, using a law dating back to the fascist era in Italy. Reporters\nWithout Borders condemned \"the disproportionate nature of the defamation\nproceedings\", for which the newspaper was liable for a fine of up to Euros\n100,000 and the editor at least three years in prison. The case was adjourned\nuntil January 2019, when it was further adjourned until May 2019. The January\nhearing was considered by the British satirical magazine _Private Eye_ to have\nbeen \"one of the more surreal courtroom scenes in modern times\", involving\ndispute as to the meaning of an English slang word used by the _Insider_.\n\nIn 2016/17 FAO was heavily criticized for recruiting Nadine Heredia Alarc\u00f3n de\nHumala, wife of the former president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, to a senior\nposition, at a time when she was being investigated by Peru following\ncorruption allegations. Critics included Transparency International.\n\nAt the end of April 2017, FAO staff unions addressed the organization's\nGoverning Council to complain about the practice of issuing short-term\ncontracts that \"exploit employees without providing job security, social\nsecurity and paid leave\". Other complaints included the increasing\ncentralization of management processes, despite claims that FAO was being\ndecentralized, and the failure to follow United Nations recommendations\nregarding increasing the retirement age. The staff representative also\ncomplained about the high percentage of unfilled positions, increasing the\nworkload for others who were under pressure to deliver more with less. She\nalso noted that contacts between Management and the staff bodies were becoming\nless and less frequent."

According to the\nreport, the acting director-general has instrumentalized the FAO in Beijing's\ninterests: It is about deliveries of pesticides banned in Europe, the majority\nof which come from the Chinese agrochemical company Syngenta, UN projects in\nline with China's \"Belt and Road Initiative\" as well as questionable\ninvestment projects."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The FAO Conference in November 2007 unanimously welcomed the IEE report and\nestablished a Conference Committee for the Follow-up to the Independent\nExternal Evaluation of FAO (CoC-IEE) to be chaired by the Independent\nChairperson of Council, and open to full participation by all Members. The\nCoC-IEE was charged to review the IEE report and its recommendations and\ndevelop an Immediate Plan of Action (IPA) for their implementation.\n\nA comprehensive programme of organizational reform and culture change began in\n2008 after the release of an Independent External Evaluation. Headquarters\nrestructuring and delegation of decision making created a flatter more\nresponsive structure and reduced costs. Modernizing and streamlining of\nadministrative and operational processes took place. Improved internal\nteamwork and closer external partnerships coupled with upgrading of IT\ninfrastructure and greater autonomy of FAO's decentralized offices now allows\nthe Organization to respond quickly where needs are greatest. As FAO is\nprimarily a knowledge based organization, investing in human resources is a\ntop priority. Capacity building including a leadership programme, employee\nrotation and a new junior professional programme were established. Individual\nperformance management, an ethics and ombudsman officer and an independent\noffice of evaluation were designed to improve performance through learning and\nstrengthened oversight.\n\nIn January 2012, the Director-General Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva acted upon the\ncommitment made during his campaign to bring the FAO reform to a successful\nand anticipated completion. In addition, the new Director-General shifted the\nfocus of the reform process to realization of its benefits and mainstreaming\nthe reform into the work of the Organization.\n\nIn July 2020, the FAO Council approved a series of measures proposed by its\nDirector-General Qu Dongyu to modernize the organization and make it more\nefficient and effective. An important element within the approved measures is\nthe adoption \"of a more flexible organizational structure, aimed at ensuring\nagility, optimal cross-sectoral collaboration and better responses to emerging\nneeds and priorities\"."
