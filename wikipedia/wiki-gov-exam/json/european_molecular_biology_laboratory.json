        "generated_section_content_md": "Molecular biology research institution\n\nThe **European Molecular Biology Laboratory** (**EMBL**) is an\nintergovernmental organization dedicated to molecular biology research and is\nsupported by 29 member states, two prospect member states, and one associate\nmember state. EMBL was created in 1974 and is funded by public research money\nfrom its member states. Research at EMBL is conducted by more than 110\nindependent research groups and service teams covering the spectrum of\nmolecular biology.\n\nThe Laboratory operates from six sites: the main laboratory in Heidelberg\n(Germany), and sites in Barcelona (Spain), Grenoble (France), Hamburg\n(Germany), Hinxton (the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), in England),\nand Rome (Italy). EMBL groups and laboratories perform basic research in\nmolecular biology and molecular medicine as well as train scientists,\nstudents, and visitors. The organization aids in the development of services,\nnew instruments and methods, and technology in its member states. Israel is\nthe only full member state located outside Europe."

        "generated_section_content_md": "EMBL was the idea of Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd, James Watson and John Kendrew. Their goal\nwas to create an international research centre, similar to CERN, to rival the\nstrongly American-dominated field of molecular biology. Kendrew served as the\nfirst Director general of EMBL until 1982 and was succeeded by Lennart\nPhilipson. From 1993 to 2005, Fotis Kafatos, served as director and was\nsucceeded by Iain Mattaj, EMBL's fourth director, from 2005 to 2018. In\nJanuary 2019, Edith Heard became the fifth director of EMBL and the first\nwoman to hold this position.\n\nHeard announced the organisation's five-year scientific programme Molecules to\nEcosystems on 19 January 2022. Heard was followed by Matthias Hentze and by\nPeer Bork who became interim director in 2025.\n\nIn 1968 the European Molecular Biology Conference was founded at CERN,\nassociating 14 governments with EMBO, providing the organisation with stable\nfunding and scientific independence. This led to the formal establishment of\nThe European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in 1974."

        "generated_section_content_md": "Each EMBL site has a specific research field. The EMBL-EBI is a hub for\nbioinformatics research and services, developing and maintaining a large\nnumber of scientific databases that are free of charge. At Grenoble and\nHamburg, research is focused on structural biology.\n\nThe EMBL Rome site is dedicated to the study of epigenetics and neurobiology.\nScientists at EMBL Barcelona are exploring how tissues and organs function and\ndevelop, in health and disease. At the headquarters in Heidelberg, there are\nunits in cell biology and biophysics, developmental biology, genome biology,\nand structural and computational biology, as well as service groups\ncomplementing the aforementioned research fields.\n\nMany scientific breakthroughs have been made at EMBL. The first systematic\ngenetic analysis of embryonic development in the fruit fly was conducted at\nEMBL by Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus, for which they were\nawarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1995. In the early 1980s,\nJacques Dubochet and his team at EMBL developed cryogenic electron microscopy\nfor biological structures. They were rewarded with the 2017 Nobel Prize in\nChemistry.\n\nEMBL Grenoble"

In 2021, EMBL\ncompleted a new centre for high-resolution light and electron microscopy at\nits Heidelberg Headquarters \u2013 the EMBL Imaging Centre. The centre is open to\nvisiting scientists worldwide and provides a unique service facility for the\nlife sciences by combining the latest imaging technologies with expert advice\nand industry-led developments not yet otherwise available."
