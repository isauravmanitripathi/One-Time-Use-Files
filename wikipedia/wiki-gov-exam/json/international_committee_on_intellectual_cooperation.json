        "generated_section_content_md": "A side of the Palais-Royal (Paris), where the IIIC was installed in 1926.\n\nTo support the work of the commission in Geneva, the organization was offered\nassistance from France to establish an executive branch, the International\nInstitute of Intellectual Cooperation (IIIC), in Paris in 1926. However, the\nIIIC had an autonomous status and was almost only financed by the French\ngovernment, giving it a certain independence that created tensions with the\nLeague of Nations. It maintained relations with the league's member states,\nwhich established national commissions for intellectual cooperation and\nappointed delegates to represent their interests at the institute in Paris.\nWhile being an international organisation, each of the IIIC's three successive\ndirectors was French:\n\n* Julien Luchaire (1926\u20131930)\n* Henri Bonnet (1931\u20131940)\n* Jean-Jacques Mayoux (1945\u20131946)\n\nFrom 1926 to 1930, Alfred Zimmern \u2013 the well-known British classicist and a\npioneering figure in the discipline of international relations \u2013 served as the\nIIIC's deputy director.\n\nAs a result of the Second World War, the institute was closed from 1940 to\n1944. It re-opened briefly from 1945 to 1946. When it closed for good in 1946,\nUNESCO inherited its archives and some parts of its mission."
