The 73 Member\nCountries of the Forum are signatories to the IEF Charter, which outlines the\nframework of the global energy dialogue through this inter-governmental\narrangement.\n\nParticipants not only include IEA and OPEC countries, but also key\ninternational actors such as Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Russia, and South\nAfrica. The IEF member countries account for more than 90 percent of global\noil and gas supply and demand.\n\nThe Forum's biennial Ministerial Meetings are the world's largest gathering of\nEnergy Ministers.\n\nThrough the Forum and its associated events, IEF Ministers, their officials,\nenergy industry executives, and other experts engage in a dialogue on global\nenergy security.\n\nThe IEF is promoted by a permanent Secretariat based in the Diplomatic Quarter\nof Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe International Energy Forum also coordinates the Joint Organisations Data\nInitiative (JODI) which is a concrete outcome of the global energy dialogue."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The concept of a systematic producer-consumer dialogue emerged in the 1970s as\na part of the general reorganisation in the global political and economic\norder with energy markets transforming the structure within individual\ncountries as well as power balances and relations between countries. In the\nwake of the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, consumers and producers\nrecognised their joint interest in the stability of the oil market, creating\ngreater awareness, and understanding sensitivities toward each other's\ninterests.\n\nThe Gulf War revealed the importance of a concerted and coordinated global\nresponse to an adverse supply shock. On October 1, 1990, at the United Nations\nGeneral Assembly, Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez called for an\nurgent meeting of producers and consumers under the auspices of the United\nNations to help the world face the growing uncertainties and politics of the\noil market. With the support of French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and\nNorwegian Prime Minister Gro Brundtland political support was gained for the\ninitiation of a Ministerial Seminar of producers and consumers.\n\nEstablished in Paris in July 1991, the International Energy Forum was created\nin order to stabilise the global energy market after the 1970s energy crisis,\nand the 1980s oil glut. One of the main priorities of the Forum was to bring\ntogether member-states and private corporations in order to increase awareness\nof national and international interests, and the workings of the market in\norder to avoid the instabilities of the previous two decades."

The Joint Organisations Data Initiative, coordinated by the IEF\nsince 2005, relies on the combined efforts of the eight JODI partner\norganisations (APEC, EUROSTAT, GECF, IEA, OLADE, OPEC, and UNSD), and more\nthan 100 national administrations, and industry stakeholders to gather, verify\nand transmit the official data that populates JODI's two public databases\nJODI-Oil and JODI-Gas with key monthly supply and demand indicators."
