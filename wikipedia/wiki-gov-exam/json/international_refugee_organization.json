A Preparatory Commission began operations fourteen\nmonths previously. In 1948, the treaty establishing the IRO formally entered\ninto force and the IRO became a United Nations specialized agency. The IRO\nassumed most of the functions of the earlier United Nations Relief and\nRehabilitation Administration. In 1952, operations of the IRO ceased, and it\nwas replaced by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for\nRefugees (UNHCR).\n\nThe **Constitution of the International Refugee Organization** , adopted by\nthe United Nations General Assembly on 15 December 1946, is the founding\ndocument of the IRO. The constitution specified the organization's field of\noperations. Controversially, the constitution defined \"persons of German\nethnic origin\" who had been expelled, or were to be expelled from their\ncountries of birth into the postwar Germany, as individuals who would \"not be\nthe concern of the Organization.\" This excluded from its purview a group that\nexceeded in number all the other European displaced persons put together.\nAlso, because of disagreements between the Western allies and the Soviet\nUnion, the IRO only worked in areas controlled by Western armies of\noccupation.\n\nTwenty-six states became members of the IRO and it formally came into\nexistence in 1948: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada,\nRepublic of China, Chile, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, France, Guatemala,\nHonduras, Iceland, Italy, Liberia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand,\nNorway, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the\nUnited States, and Venezuela. The U.S. provided about 40% of the IRO's $155\nmillion annual budget. The total contribution by the members for the five\nyears of operation was around $400 million. It had rehabilitated around 10\nmillion people during this time, out of 15 million people who were stranded in\nEurope. The IRO's first Director-General was William Hallam Tuck, succeeded by\nJ. Donald Kingsley on 31 July 1949.\n\nIRO closed its operations on 31 January 1952 and after a liquidation period,\nwent out of existence on 30 September 1953. By that time many of its\nresponsibilities had been assumed by other agencies. Of particular importance\nwas the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, established in January\n1951 as a part of the United Nations, and the Intergovernmental Committee for\nEuropean Migration (originally PICMME), set up in December 1951."
