It is one\nof five regional commissions.\n\nThe ECA has 54 member states, corresponding to the 54 member states of the\nUnited Nations that lie within the continent of Africa or in oceans nearby the\ncontinent. The ECA's mandate is to promote the economic and social development\nof its member states, foster intra-regional integration, and promote\ninternational cooperation for Africa's development.\n\nOn October 6, 2023, the UN Secretary-General appointed Claver Gatete of Rwanda\nas the Executive Secretary of UNECA, replacing the Cameroonian Vera Songwe."

        "section_name": "Implementing Sustainable Development Goals",
        "generated_section_content_md": "The ECA seeks to balance the global Sustainable Development Goals with prior\nregional agendas that are supported by governments. Notably this is done for\nAgenda 2063, which was agreed on by the African Union a few months before the\nlaunch of the SDGs in 2015. To better integrate the two agendas in country\nplans and activities, UNECA has developed an online tool indicating synergies\nand trade-offs and an integrated planning and reporting toolkit. In terms of\ngaps, three of twenty Agenda 2063 goals do not align with any SDG (notably the\ngoals on the establishment of continental financial and monetary institutions\nand on regional peace and stability, although perhaps these can be caught in a\nbroad definition of SDG 17).\n\nThe Regional Fora for Sustainable Development work as a coordination mechanism\nand resemble a \u201cmini-High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development\n(HLPF)\u201d in the region. The _Seventh African Forum on Sustainable Development_\n, for example, was followed by efforts to seek more funding for the Congo\nBasin by taking the conference outcomes to both the COP26 (the 26th conference\nof the parties to the UN climate convention) in Glasgow in 2021 and to the\nHigh-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development."

        "generated_section_content_md": "The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in more debts for many countries and sparked a\nglobal discussion on new financial mechanisms. All of the Regional\nCommissions\u2014except for the one for Europe, given the prevalence of high-income\ncountries in its membership\u2014launched new initiatives, many linked to climate\nfinance. The ECA launched the _Liquidity and Sustainability Facility_ in 2021\nto mobilize (private sector) capital, supported by an asset management firm\nand a collateral management provider. Its objectives are to support the\nliquidity of African sovereign eurobonds and incentivize SDG-related\ninvestments on the continent."
