        "generated_section_content_md": "The British\u2013Irish Council was established on 10 April 1998 following two years\nworth of negotiations between the UK and Irish Governments alongside the\npolitical parties in Northern Ireland on the terms of the Good Friday\nAgreement. Under the terms of the agreement, a political organisation was to\nbe established in order to foster and provide opportunities to greater\nintegral working between both the UK and Irish governments, and later the\ndevolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Multi-Party\nagreement between both the UK and Irish governments formally came into effect\non 2 December 1999.\n\nSince its formation, the heads of governments of the United Kingdom, the\nRepublic of Ireland, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man,\nGuernsey and Jersey have met biannually during the Heads of Administrations\nsummit. The first meeting of the British\u2013Irish council took place on 17\nDecember 1999. The first meeting was hosted by the United Kingdom and Prime\nMinister Tony Blair in London.\n\nIn 2006, the St. Andrews Agreement was signed in order to establish a standing\npermanent Secretariat to the British\u2013Irish Council. The establishment of the\nposition was designed to \"further the British-Irish Council work\". The\nPermanent Secretariat was established six years later, located in the capital\ncity of Scotland, Edinburgh following an agreement between council members at\nthe summit in 2010 hosted by Guernsey that the Scottish Government would be\nthe Permanent Secretariat host. The Secretariat was formally established in\nJanuary 2012.\n\nIn 2023, the summits held in Jersey and the Republic of Ireland marked twenty-\nfive years since the Good Friday Agreement, whilst the 42nd summit hosted by\nScotland in December 2024 marked twenty-five years since the inaugural meeting\nof the council."

        "generated_section_content_md": "A British-Irish Council summit hosted by Scotland at Stirling Castle\n\nThe nine heads of government meet at summits twice per year. Additionally,\nthere are regular meetings that deal with specific sectors which are attended\nby the corresponding ministers. Representatives of members operate in\naccordance with whatever procedures for democratic authority and\naccountability are in force in their respective elected legislatures.\n\nEngland, unlike the other countries of the United Kingdom, is not represented\nseparately, as it does not have its own devolved administration. It is thus\nsolely represented on the council as part of the United Kingdom. Although\nCornwall technically holds observer status on the Council due to its language,\nit is also represented by the UK government.\n\nThe work of the council is financed by members through mutual agreement as\nrequired. At the ninth meeting of the Council in July 2007 it was decided that\nwith devolved government returned to Northern Ireland that an opportune time\nexisted \"to undertake a strategic review of the Council's work programmes,\nworking methods and support arrangements.\" This decision included the\npotential for a permanent standing secretariat, which was established in\nEdinburgh, Scotland, on 4 January 2012.\n\nAt its June 2010 summit, the Council decided to move forward on\nrecommendations to enhance the relationship between it and the British-Irish\nParliamentary Assembly (BIPA). The British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly is\nmade up of members from the parliaments and assemblies of the same states and\nregions as the members of the British\u2013Irish Council. The Council tasked its\nsecretariat with moving this work forward in conjunction with the BIPA's\nsecretariat."

However, these work\nareas can be expanded or reduced as the Council decides. It is also open to\nthe council to make agreement on common policies.
