As of 2020[update], its assets\nstood at 28 billion euros, which it uses to co-finance projects by means of\nloans of up to 40% of the project cost.\n\nIts origins go back to 1956 when the Council of Europe created its\nResettlement Fund for National Refugees and Over-Population in Europe (French:\n_**Fonds de r\u00e9tablissement du Conseil de l'Europe pour les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s**_), which\nwas renamed as the Council of Europe Social Development Fund (French: _**Fonds\nde d\u00e9veloppement social du Conseil de l'Europe**_) in 1994 and eventually as\nthe CEB in 1999. Since 1956, the bank has been headquartered at 55, avenue\nKl\u00e9ber in Paris. It is a separate legal entity from the Council of Europe and\nis autonomous in its decision-making. It has a high credit rating from\nMoody's, Standard and Poor's and Fitch Ratings.\n\nCEB formally uses both the French and English languages. English largely\nreplaced French as internal working language in the 2010s.[_citation needed_]"

In 1994, it changed its name to the Council of Europe\nSocial Development Fund, before becoming the Council of Europe Development\nBank in 1999.\n\nThe original aim was to help refugees and other displaced persons after the\nSecond World War. It later expanded its scope of activities to include\nassistance to disaster victims, help with job creation, and improve social\ninfrastructure. Its aim today is to promote social cohesion in its member\nstates."
