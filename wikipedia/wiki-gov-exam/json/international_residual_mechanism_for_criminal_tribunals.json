It is based in both Arusha, Tanzania and The Hague, Netherlands."

        "generated_section_content_md": "In the early 1990s, the United Nations Security Council established two\ncriminal courts whose purpose was to investigate and prosecute individuals\nresponsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The first\nof these courts was the International Criminal Tribunal for the former\nYugoslavia (ICTY), which was established in 1993 to investigate crimes\ncommitted during the Yugoslav Wars. The second court, the International\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), was established the following year to\naddress crimes committed during the Rwandan genocide. Both the ICTY and the\nICTR were meant to be temporary institutions that would conclude after their\nmandate to investigate crimes and prosecute individuals was completed.\nAlthough both tribunals have completed substantially all of their mandates,\nthere are residual functions that will not be accomplished for many more\nyears. For example, future trials may be held once remaining ICTR fugitives\nare captured, convicted persons may still petition for early release,\nprotective orders for witnesses may need to be modified, and the archives that\ncontain confidential documents need to be safeguarded. In order to oversee the\nresidual functions of the ICTY and ICTR in an efficient manner, the Security\nCouncil passed Resolution 1966 on 22 December 2010, which created the\nMechanism."

        "section_name": "Mandate",
        "generated_section_content_md": "In Resolution 1966, the Security Council decided that \"the Mechanism shall\ncontinue the jurisdiction, rights and obligations and essential functions of\nthe ICTY and the ICTR.\" The Security Council further envisioned that the\nMechanism would be \"a small, temporary and efficient structure, whose\nfunctions and size will diminish over time, with a small number of staff\ncommensurate with its reduced functions.\" The Mechanism will continue to\noperate until the Security Council decides otherwise, however it will be\nsubject to a two-year review beginning in 2016.\n\nThe Mechanism comprises two branches. One branch covers functions inherited\nfrom the ICTR and is located in Arusha, Tanzania. It commenced functioning on\n1 July 2012. The other branch is located in The Hague, Netherlands and began\noperating on 1 July 2013. During the initial period of the Mechanism's work,\nthere was a temporal overlap with the ICTR and the ICTY as these institutions\ncomplete outstanding work on any trial or appeal proceedings which are pending\nas of the commencement dates of the respective branches of the Mechanism."

In accordance with this Article, the ICTR\nProsecutor requested referrals to Rwanda in the cases of the last two\nfugitives: Charles Sikubwabo and Charles Ryandikayo, later declared dead on\nMay 15, 2024. With these deaths, the IRMCT announced that all ICTR fugitives\nhad been successfully accounted for.\n\nOver 1000 G\u00e9nocidaire fugitives are sought by national authorities and the\nIRMCT continues to assist in the tracking of these fugitives."
