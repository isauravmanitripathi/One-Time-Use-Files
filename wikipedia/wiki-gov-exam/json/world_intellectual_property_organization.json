        "generated_section_content_md": "Specialised agency of the United Nations\n\nThe United Nations Office at Geneva (Switzerland) is the second biggest UN\ncentre, after the United Nations headquarters (New York City).\n\nThe **World Intellectual Property Organization** (**WIPO** ; French:\n_Organisation mondiale de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 intellectuelle_ (**OMPI**)) is one of\nthe 15 specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN). Pursuant to the 1967\nConvention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO was\ncreated to promote and protect intellectual property (IP) across the world by\ncooperating with countries as well as international organizations. It began\noperations on 26 April 1970 when the convention entered into force. The\ncurrent Director General is Singaporean Daren Tang, former head of the\nIntellectual Property Office of Singapore, who began his term on 1 October\n2020.\n\nWIPO's activities include: hosting forums to discuss and shape international\nIP rules and policies, providing global services that register and protect IP\nin different countries, resolving transboundary IP disputes, helping connect\nIP systems through uniform standards and infrastructure, and serving as a\ngeneral reference database on all IP matters; this includes providing reports\nand statistics on the state of IP protection or innovation both globally and\nin specific countries. WIPO also works with governments, nongovernmental\norganizations (NGOs), and individuals to utilize IP for socioeconomic\ndevelopment.\n\nWIPO administers 26 international treaties that concern a wide variety of\nintellectual property issues, ranging from the protection of audiovisual works\nto establishing international patent classification. It is governed by the\nGeneral Assembly and the Coordination Committee, which together set policy and\nserve as the main decision making bodies. The General Assembly also elects\nWIPO's chief administrator, the Director General, currently Daren Tang of\nSingapore, who took office on 1 October 2020. WIPO is administered by a\nSecretariat that helps carry out its day-to-day activities.\n\nHeadquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, WIPO has \"external offices\" around the\nworld, including in Algiers (Algeria); Rio de Janeiro (Brazil); Beijing\n(China), Tokyo (Japan); Abuja (Nigeria); Moscow (Russia); and Singapore\n(Singapore). Unlike most UN organizations, WIPO does not rely heavily on\nassessed or voluntary contributions from member states; 95 percent of its\nbudget comes from fees related to its global services.\n\nWIPO currently has 193 member states, including 190 UN member states and the\nCook Islands, Holy See and Niue; Palestine has permanent observer status. The\nonly non-members, among the countries recognized by the UN are the Federated\nStates of Micronesia, Palau and South Sudan.[_citation needed_]"

The Paris\nConvention was the first international agreement to protect the works of\ncreators in other countries.\n\nMoving on, the Convention was adopted in diplomatic conferences held in Paris\nin 1880 and 1883, it was then signed on 20 March 1883, on behalf of Brazil,\nFrance, Guatemala, Netherlands, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland,\nBelgium, Italy and El Salvador. It consisted of the Convention proper, which\ncontains 19 articles, and the _Protocole de cl\u00f4ture_ (Final Protocol), which\nis almost the same length as the Convention proper.\n\nThe \"International Bureau\" established by the Paris Convention for the\nProtection of Industrial Property later became part of BIRPI and later WIPO."
