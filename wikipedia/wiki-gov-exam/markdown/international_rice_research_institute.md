Agricultural research and training organization

The **International Rice Research Institute** (**IRRI**) is an international
agricultural research and training organization with its headquarters in Los
Baños, Laguna, and offices in seventeen countries. IRRI is known for its work
in developing rice varieties that contributed to the Green Revolution in the
1960s which preempted the famine in Asia.

The institute, established in 1960 aims to reduce poverty and hunger, improve
the health of rice farmers and consumers, and ensure environmental
sustainability of rice farming. It advances its mission through collaborative
research, partnerships, and the strengthening of the national agricultural
research and extension systems of the countries IRRI works in.

IRRI is one of 15 agricultural research centers in the world that form the
CGIAR Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers, a global
partnership of organizations engaged in research on food security. It is also
the largest non-profit agricultural research center in Asia.

## Origins

IRRI was established in 1960 with the support of the Ford Foundation, the
Rockefeller Foundation, and the Government of the Philippines.

An International treaty titled: _Agreement Recognising the International Legal
Personality of the International Rice Research Institute_ was tabled in Manila
on 19 May 1995.

IRRI is well known for its contribution to the "Green Revolution" movement in
Asia during the late 1960s and 1970s, which involved the breeding of "semi-
dwarf" varieties of rice that were less likely to lodge (fall over). IRRI's
semi-dwarf varieties, including the famous IR8, saved India from famine in the
1960s. The varieties developed at IRRI, known as IR varieties, are well
accepted in many Asian countries. In 2005, it was estimated that 60% of the
world's rice area was planted to IRRI-bred rice varieties or their progenies.

A report published by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural
Research in 2011 assessed the impact of IRRI's breeding work in three
countries in South East Asia between 1985 and 2009. It found IRRI's breeding
work delivered an annual benefit of US$1.46 billion and boosted rice yields up
to 13%.

IRRI, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and BGI (formerly known as
the Beijing Genomics Institute) have "identified the exact genetic makeup of
more than 3,000 different families of rice for the first time in what is being
heralded as a major advancement in rice science."

For five decades, IRRI has provided a place for scientists and future leaders
in rice research to learn. Since 1964, over 15,000 scientists have undergone
training at IRRI to conduct rice research.

## Golden rice

IRRI is pursuing the development of "golden rice". Geneticists inserted two
genes into the rice plant that allows it to produce beta carotene, which makes
its grains yellow. Because the human body converts beta carotene to vitamin A,
golden rice has the potential to dramatically improve the lives of millions of
people around the world, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, where
vitamin A deficiency is an especially common malady that can cause blindness
and increases the risk of death from disease. Children are particularly
vulnerable; according to the World Health Organization, "An estimated 250,000
to 500,000 vitamin A-deficient children become blind every year, half of them
dying within 12 months of losing their sight". In August 2013, anti-
genetically modified organism protestors broke into IRRI's research facilities
and destroyed field trials of golden rice. The Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation supports IRRI in its development of golden rice.

## Research

IRRI's website states that their research themes consist of:

> THEME 1: Harnessing genetic diversity to chart new productivity, quality,
> and health horizons
>
> THEME 2: Accelerating the development, delivery, and adoption of improved
> rice varieties
>
> THEME 3: Ecological and sustainable management of rice-based production
> systems
>
> THEME 4: Extracting more value from rice harvests through improved quality,
> processing, market systems, and new products
>
> THEME 5: Technology evaluations, targeting, and policy options for enhanced
> impact
>
> THEME 6: Supporting the growth of the global rice sector

Additionally, the organisation describes their expertise as including:

> conserving, understanding, sharing, and using rice genetic diversity;
> breeding and delivering new varieties; developing and sharing improved crop
> and environmental management practices; adding to the economic and
> nutritional value of rice; broadening our impact by supporting strategic
> policy and market development; and facilitating large-scale adoption of
> technologies.

In 2010, the Global Rice Science Partnership (GRiSP) was launched, which IRRI
leads in Asia, the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) leads in Africa, and
International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) leads in Latin America.
It aims to "dramatically improve the ability of rice farmers to feed growing
populations in some of the world's poorest nations".

## Awards

In 1969, IRRI was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International
Understanding. The Ramon Magsaysay Award is an annual award was established in
1957 by the trustees of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund based in New York City,
with the concurrence of the Philippine government, to "perpetuate former
Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay's example of integrity in governance,
courageous service to the people, and pragmatic idealism within a democratic
society". This award is Asia's highest honor and widely regarded as the Asian
equivalent to the Nobel Prize. The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation posited
that IRRI represented "the first coordinated international attempt in the
tropics to solve a major problem of world agriculture", while also stating:

> Distilling more than three millennia of accumulated insight in cultivating
> man's leading cereal crop, the International Rice Research Institute, with
> its creation of "miracle rice", inaugurated a "green revolution", promising
> nearly one-half of humanity the prospect of suffficiency in its staple food.

Additionally, IRRI received the 2010 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge
Award in the category of Development Cooperation. This was awarded for the
organization's contribution to "reducing poverty and hunger in the world by
means of rice research and farmer training", and "for the quality of its
research work, which has led to the development of new rice varieties adapted
to different cropping areas in Asia and providing improved yield and
sustainability across multiple climate regimes". IRRI was nominated for the
award by Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. The award
jury also pointed to:

> IRRI's success in transferring the results of its research, by working with
> local teams and organizations in Asian and sub-Saharan countries and making
> its varieties freely available to farmers. By this means, the IRRI has
> secured the effective dissemination of its innovations with the resultant
> increase in production of this basic crop.

## Transportation

There are scheduled shuttle buses (mainly for employees and quantity depend on
the timing, usually only one) that move back and forth from the UPLB campus to
the IRRI lobby and three other buildings for free.

## Facilities

IRRI's headquarters in the Philippines is located on a 252 hectares (620
acres) experimental farm with modern laboratories and glasshouses, and a
training center. The land is owned by the University of the Philippines Los
Baños and is leased to the institute. It also houses the International Rice
Genebank and Riceworld Museum. The International Rice Genebank holds more than
127,000 accessions of rice and wild relatives and is the biggest collection of
rice genetic diversity in the world. The International Network for Genetic
Evaluation of Rice (INGER) was created by IRRI in 1975 as the International
Rice Testing Program IRTP. INGER accepts accessions and then holds,
multiplies, and distributes them to researchers without restriction, including
restriction on commercial use.
