**World Agroforestry** (a brand name used by the **International Centre for
Research in Agroforestry** , **ICRAF**) is an international institute
headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya, and founded in 1978 as "International Council
for Research in Agroforestry". The centre specializes in the sustainable
management, protection and regulation of tropical rainforest and natural
reserves. It is one of 15 agricultural research centres which makes up the
global network known as the CGIAR.

## Description

The centre conducts research in agroforestry, in partnership with national
agricultural research systems with a view to developing more sustainable and
productive land use. The focus of its research is countries/regions in the
developing world, particular in the tropics of Central and South America,
Southeast Asia, South Asia, West Africa, Eastern Africa and parts of central
Africa. In 2002, the centre acquired the World Agroforestry Centre brand name,
although **International Centre for Research in Agroforestry** remains its
legal name and it continues to use the acronym **ICRAF**.

In 2017, ICRAF released a study at the UN Climate Change Conference that
centers on agroforestry and the emission of carbons from deforestation.
