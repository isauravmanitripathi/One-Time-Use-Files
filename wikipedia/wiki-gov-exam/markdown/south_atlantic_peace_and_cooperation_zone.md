President Fernando Henrique Cardoso speaks at the ZPCAS Summit held in
Brasília.

The **South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone** (abbreviations: **ZPCAS** or
**ZOPACAS** ; Spanish: _Zona de Paz y Cooperación del Atlántico Sur_ ;
Portuguese: _Zona de Paz e Cooperação do Atlântico Sul_ ; also called the
_Zone of Peace and Cooperation of the South Atlantic_) was created in 1986
through resolution A/RES/41/11 of the U.N. general assembly on Brazil's
initiative, with the aim of promoting cooperation and the maintenance of peace
and security in the South Atlantic region. Particular attention was dedicated
to the question of preventing the geographical proliferation of nuclear
weapons and of reducing and eventually eliminating the military presence of
countries from other regions.

A Declaration on the denuclearization of the South Atlantic region was adopted
at a meeting of member states held in Brasília in September 1994. The U.N.
General Assembly endorsed the initiative, albeit with opposition from the
United States, United Kingdom and France.

The South Atlantic itself is currently not a nuclear-weapon-free zone but all
member states are currently signatories of international treaties that
prohibit nuclear weapons, namely the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty
and the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the
Caribbean. However, several Mid-Atlantic Ridge islands, the British overseas
territory of Saint Helena and its dependencies Ascension Island and Tristan da
Cunha, and Norway's Bouvet Island are not covered by those treaties. However,
the British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia and
the South Sandwich Islands are covered by these treaties.
