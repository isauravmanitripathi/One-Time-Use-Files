The **Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development** (**OECD** ;
French: _Organisation de coopération et de développement économiques_ ,
**OCDE**) is an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries,
founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. It is a forum
whose member countries describe themselves as committed to democracy and the
market economy, providing a platform to compare policy experiences, seek
answers to common problems, identify good practices, and coordinate domestic
and international policies of its members.

The majority of OECD members are generally regarded as developed countries,
with high-income economies, and a very high Human Development Index.

As of 2024[update] their collective population is 1.38 billion people with an
average life expectancy of 80 years and a median age of 40, against a global
average of 30. As of 2017[update], OECD Member countries collectively
comprised 62.2% of global nominal GDP (USD 49.6 trillion) and 42.8% of global
GDP (Int$54.2 trillion) at purchasing power parity. The OECD is an official
United Nations observer. OECD nations have strong social security systems;
their average social welfare spending stood at roughly 21% of GDP.

The OECD's headquarters are at the Château de la Muette in Paris, France,
which housed its predecessor organisation, the Organization for European
Economic Co-operation. The OECD is funded by contributions from member
countries at varying rates and is recognised as a highly influential publisher
of mostly economic data through publications as well as annual evaluations and
rankings of member countries.

## History

### Organisation for European Economic Co-operation

The OECD is the successor organisation to the **Organisation for European
Economic Co-operation** (**OEEC**), established in April 1948 among the
European recipients of Marshall Plan aid for the reconstruction of Europe
after World War II. Only Western European states were members of the OEEC,
whose primary function was the allocation of American aid. Its Secretaries-
General were the Frenchmen Robert Marjolin (1948–1955) and René Sergent
(1955–1960). It was headquartered in the Château de la Muette in Paris.

Following the end of Marshall aid in 1952, the OEEC focused on economic
issues. Its coordinating role was challenged after the 1957 Rome Treaties
establishing the European Economic Community and Euratom. The OEEC provided a
framework for negotiations aimed at setting up a European Free Trade Area, to
bring the EEC's Inner Six and other OEEC members together on a multilateral
basis. In 1958, a European Nuclear Energy Agency was set up in response to
Euratom.

By this time, some leading countries felt that the OEEC had outlived its
purpose but could be adapted to fulfil a more global mission, which proved to
be a cumbersome task. Following several (occasionally unruly) meetings at the
Hotel Majestic in Paris, which began in January 1960, a resolution was reached
to create a body that would not only solve European and Atlantic economic
issues, but also devise policies that could assist less developed countries.
This reconstituted organisation would bring the US and Canada, who were
already OEEC observers, on board as full members, and the OEEC would set to
work straight away on convincing Japan to join the organisation.

### Founding

The Convention on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
was signed on 14 December 1960, and the OECD officially superseded the OEEC in
September 1961, consisting of the European founder countries of the OEEC, with
the additions of the United States and Canada. Three countries, (Netherlands,
Luxembourg, and Italy)—all OEEC members—ratified the OECD Convention after
September 1961, but are nevertheless considered founding members. The official
founding members are the following:

  * Austria
  * Belgium
  * Canada
  * Denmark
  * France
  * West Germany
  * Greece
  * Iceland
  * Ireland
  * Italy
  * Luxembourg
  * Netherlands
  * Norway
  * Portugal
  * Spain
  * Sweden
  * Switzerland
  * Turkey
  * United Kingdom
  * United States

Japan became a member in 1964, and over the following decade, Finland,
Australia, and New Zealand also joined the organisation. Yugoslavia had
observer status in the organisation, starting with the establishment of the
OECD, until its dissolution as a country. The OECD also created agencies such
as the OECD Development Centre (1961), International Energy Agency (IEA,
1974), and Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.

The aims of the OECD are stated in Article 1 of the Convention as:

  1. To achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment and a rising standard of living in Member countries, while maintaining financial stability
  2. To contribute to sound economic expansion in Member as well as non-member countries
  3. To contribute to the expansion of world trade

### Enlargement to Central Europe

Following the Revolutions of 1989, the OECD began assisting countries in
Central Europe (especially the Visegrád Group) to prepare market economy
reforms. In 1990, the Centre for Co-operation with European Economies in
Transition (now succeeded by the Centre for Cooperation with Non-Members) was
established, and in 1991, the programme, "Partners in Transition", was
launched to offer a partnership to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland,
including a membership option for these countries. As a result of this,
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, as well as South Korea and
Mexico, became members of the OECD between 1996 and 2000.

### Reform and further enlargement

East Germany joined on 3 October 1990 through reunification with West Germany.
In the 1990s, several European countries, now members of the European Union,
expressed their willingness to join the Organisation. In 1995, Cyprus applied
for membership, but according to the Cypriot government, it was vetoed by
Turkey. In 1996, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania signed a Joint Declaration
expressing willingness to become members of the OECD, and Slovenia also
applied for membership that same year. In 2005, Malta applied to join the
Organisation. The EU is lobbying for the admission of all EU member states.
Romania reaffirmed in 2012 its intention to become a member of the
Organisation through the letter addressed by Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ponta to OECD Secretary-General José Ángel Gurría. In September 2012, the
government of Bulgaria confirmed it would apply for membership before the OECD
Secretariat.

The OECD established a working group headed by ambassador Seiichiro Noboru to
work out a plan for the enlargement with non-members. The working group
defined four criteria that must be fulfilled: "like-mindedness", "significant
player", "mutual benefit" and "global considerations." The working group's
recommendations were presented at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting on 13
May 2004, and on 16 May 2007, the OECD Ministerial Council decided to open
accession discussions with Chile, Estonia, Israel, Russia, and Slovenia, and
to strengthen cooperation with Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, and South
Africa through a process of enhanced engagement. Chile, Slovenia, Israel, and
Estonia all became members in 2010. In March 2014, the OECD halted membership
talks with Russia in response to its role in the 2014 annexation of Crimea.

In 2013, the OECD decided to open membership talks with Colombia and Latvia.
In 2015, the Organisation opened talks with Costa Rica and Lithuania. Latvia
became a member on 1 July 2016, and Lithuania soon followed on 5 July 2018.
Colombia signed the accession agreement on 30 May 2018 and became a member on
28 April 2020. On 15 May 2020, the OECD decided to extend a formal invitation
for Costa Rica to join the OECD, which joined as a member on 25 May 2021.

Other countries that have expressed interest in OECD membership are Argentina,
Brazil, Croatia, Malaysia and Peru.

In January 2022, the OECD reported that membership talks were underway with
Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Peru and Romania.

In March 2022, the OECD suspended the participation of Russia and Belarus due
to the ongoing 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

In June 2022, during the annual OECD Ministerial Council Meeting, the Roadmaps
for the Accession to the OECD Convention for Brazil, Bulgaria, Croatia, Peru
and Romania were adopted. In March 2024, the Roadmaps for the Accession to the
OECD were adopted with Argentina and Indonesia, and in July 2024, also with
Thailand.

## Objectives and issues

### Taxation

The OECD sets the rules governing international taxation for multinationals
through the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and
Tax Administrations, a Model Tax Convention and country-by-country reporting
rules.

Payroll and income tax by OECD country

The OECD publishes and updates a model tax convention that serves as a
template for allocating taxation rights between countries. This model is
accompanied by a set of commentaries that reflect OECD-level interpretation of
the content of the model convention provisions. In general, this model
allocates the primary right to tax to the country from which capital
investment originates (i.e., the home, or resident country) rather than the
country in which the investment is made (the host, or source country). As a
result, it is most effective between two countries with reciprocal investment
flows (such as among the OECD member countries), but can be unbalanced when
one of the signatory countries is economically weaker than the other (such as
between OECD and non-OECD pairings). Additionally, the OECD has published and
updated the Transfer Pricing Guidelines since 1995. The Transfer Pricing
Guidelines serve as a template for the profit allocation of inter-company
transactions to countries. The latest version, of July 2017, incorporates the
approved Actions developed under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
project initiated by the G20.[_citation needed_]

**Pillar 1**  

    An OECD proposal to allocate multinational profits (for taxing purposes) to countries where they do business, by a formula, including to markets which multinationals sell into without a physical presence. This is hoped to eliminate the need for Digital Services Tax implemented by several countries, including France. There are exclusions and minimum thresholds, including banking and extractive industries. The proposal involves allocating only residual profit (i.e., profits above what is established through transfer pricing, thus creating a hybrid mechanism). This is essentially no change to what is currently allowed (routine profits allocated using transfer pricing + residual profits allocated through profit split).

**Pillar 2**  

    On 1 July 2021, finance officials from 130 countries agreed on plans for a new international taxation policy known as the global minimum corporate tax (of 15%). If a country taxes a multinational at a lower rate, the multinational's HQ will receive the difference.

It is not certain when the proposals will be implemented.

All the major economies agreed to pass national laws that would require
corporations to pay at least 15% income tax in the countries they operate.
This new policy would end the practice of locating world headquarters in small
countries with very low taxation rates. Governments hope to recoup some of the
lost revenue, estimated at $100 billion to $240 billion each year. The new
system was promoted by the Biden Administration in the United States and the
OECD. Secretary-General Mathias Cormann of the OECD said, "This historic
package will ensure that large multinational companies pay their fair share of
tax everywhere."

### Multinational corporations

The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are a set of legally non-
binding guidelines attached as an annex to the OECD Declaration on
International Investment and Multinational Enterprises. They are
recommendations providing principles and standards for responsible business
conduct for multinational corporations operating in or from countries adhering
to the Declaration.

## Publications

The OECD publishes books, reports, statistics, working papers, and reference
materials. All titles and databases published since 1998 can be accessed via
OECD iLibrary. The OECD Library & Archives collection dates from 1947,
including records from the Committee for European Economic Co-operation (CEEC)
and the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), predecessors
of today's OECD. External researchers can consult OECD publications and
archival material on the OECD premises by appointment.

### Books

Reports on a wide range of topics for sale at the OECD's Conference Centre
Bookshop in 2019

The OECD releases about 600 books and over 400 papers yearly on topics
spanning public policy. The publications are updated to the OECD iLibrary.
Most books are published in English and French. The OECD flagship titles
include:

  * The OECD Economic Outlook, published twice a year. It contains forecast and analysis of the economic situation of the OECD member countries. The OECD exceptionally published the 2020 Economic Outlook on 10 June 2020 to adjust economic forecasts greatly impacted by the Coronavirus since the March Interim Economic Outlook. The June Economic Outlook assesses the economic impact of COVID-19 and provides projections for economic impact if a second outbreak were to occur.
  * The Main Economic Indicators, published monthly. It contains a large selection of timely statistical indicators.
  * The OECD Factbook is published yearly and available online, as an iPhone app, and in print. The Factbook contains more than 100 economic, environmental and social indicators, each presented with a clear definition, tables, and graphs. The Factbook mainly focuses on the statistics of its member countries and sometimes other major additional countries. It is freely accessible online and delivers all the data in Excel format via StatLinks.
  * The OECD Communications Outlook and the OECD Internet Economy Outlook (formerly the Information Technology Outlook), which rotate every year. They contain forecasts and analysis of the communications and information technology industries in OECD member countries and non-member economies.
  * In 2007 the OECD published _Human Capital: How what you know shapes your life_ , the first book in the _OECD Insights_ series. This series uses OECD analysis and data to introduce important social and economic issues to non-specialist readers. Other books in the series cover sustainable development, international trade and international migration. The series was discontinued in 2017.

All OECD books are available on the OECD iLibrary, the online bookshop or OECD
Library & Archives.

### Magazine

_OECD Observer_ , an award-winning magazine, was launched in 1962. The
magazine appeared six times a year until 2010, and became quarterly in 2011
with the introduction of the _OECD Yearbook_ , launched for the 50th
anniversary of the organisation. The online and mobile editions contained
news, analysis, reviews, commentaries and data on global economic, social and
environmental challenges and listings of the latest OECD books. An OECD
Observer Crossword was introduced in Q2 2013. The OECD Observer was last
issued in the fourth quarter of 2019, with a double edition looking ahead at
artificial intelligence, and a cover leading on why statistical offices should
hire a comedian. The OECD Observer website closed in the first quarter of
2021; the archive can be consulted at www.oecd.org.

### Documentation on OECD's multilateral surveillance

The OECD's multilateral surveillance was systematically reviewed for the first
time in Kumiharu Shigehara, "Multilateral Surveillance: What the OECD can
offer?" (the 1996 Global Finance Lecture, the University of Birmingham, 1996;
OECD publication, Paris, 1996) at a time when Shigehara was OECD Chief
Economist and Head of Economics Department (1992–1997); he was subsequently
OECD Deputy Secretary-General (1997–1999).

It was also discussed in:

  * Kumiharu Shigehara, "Surveillance by International Institutions: Lessons from the Global Financial and Economic Crisis" (OECD Working Papers No.860, May 2011, co-authored with Paul Atkinson).
  * Kumiharu Shigehara, "Multilateral Surveillance: the IMF, the OECD and G20" (Ligue Européenne de Coopération Économique, Paris, 2011)
  * Kumiharu Shigehara, "The Limits of Surveillance and Financial Market Failure: Lessons from the Euro-Area Crisis" (Palgrave Macmillan 2014)

The history of OECD multilateral surveillance from the 1960s to the end of the
1990s was also described in the memoirs titled "the Bank of Japan and the
OECD: Recollections and Reflections", written in Japanese by Kumiharu
Shigehara and published in December 2019. In his letter of 5 February 2019,
Donald Johnston, OECD Secretary-General (1996–2006), noted that Shigehara's
"book is very important for the OECD where there is little living
institutional memory". The English edition of Shigehara's memoirs titled _The
Bank of Japan, the OECD, and Beyond_ was published by Palgrave Macmillan in
September 2024.

### Statistics

The OECD is known as a statistical agency, as it publishes comparable
statistics on numerous subjects. In July 2014, the OECD publicly released its
main statistical databases through the OECD Data Portal, an online platform
that allows visitors to create custom charts based on official OECD
indicators.

OECD statistics are available in several forms:

  * as interactive charts on the OECD Data Portal,
  * as interactive databases on iLibrary together with key comparative and country tables,
  * as static files or dynamic database views on the OECD Statistics portal,
  * as StatLinks (in most OECD books, there is a URL that links to the underlying data).

In July 2024, the OECD announced that it "has transitioned to [an] open-access
information model" and that Creative Commons CC‑BY‑4.0 attribution licenses
will be used on all data and publications.

### Working papers

There are 15 working papers series published by the various directorates of
the OECD Secretariat. They are available on iLibrary, as well as on many
specialised portals.

### Reference works

The OECD is responsible for the OECD Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals,
a continuously updated document that is a _de facto_ standard (i.e., soft
law).

It published the _OECD Environmental Outlook to 2030_ in March 2008, which
argues that tackling key environmental problems—including climate change,
biodiversity loss, water scarcity, and the health impacts of pollution—is both
achievable and affordable.

### SDG Pathfinder

In 2020, the inaugural University Press Redux Sustainability Award was given
to OECD by the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers
(ALPSP) and Cambridge University Press. The award recognised the development
of the SDG Pathfinder, an open-access digital discovery tool for finding
content and data relating to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## Structure

The OECD's structure consists of three main elements:

  * The OECD member countries, each represented by a delegation led by an ambassador. Together, they form the OECD Council. Member countries act collectively through the council (and its standing committees) to provide direction and guidance to the work of the organisation.
  * The OECD substantive committees, one for each work area of the OECD, plus their various subsidiary bodies. Committee members are typically subject-matter experts from member and non-member governments. The committees oversee all the work on each theme (publications, task forces, conferences, and so on). Committee members then relay the conclusions to their capitals.
  * The OECD Secretariat, led by the Secretary-General (currently Mathias Cormann), provides support to standing and substantive committees. It is organised into directorates, which include about 2,500 staff.

### Meetings

The main entrance to the OECD Conference Centre in Paris

Delegates from the member countries attend committee and other meetings.
Former Deputy Secretary-General Pierre Vinde [sv] estimated in 1997 that the
cost borne by the member countries, such as sending their officials to OECD
meetings and maintaining permanent delegations, is equivalent to the cost of
running the secretariat. This ratio is unique among inter-governmental
organisations.[_citation needed_] In other words, the OECD is more a
persistent forum or network of officials and experts than an administration.

The OECD regularly holds minister-level meetings and forums as platforms for a
discussion on a broad spectrum of thematic issues relevant to the OECD
charter, member countries, and non-member countries.

Noteworthy meetings include:

  * The yearly Ministerial Council Meeting, with the Ministers of Economy of all member countries and the candidates for enhanced engagement among the countries.
  * The annual OECD Forum, which brings together leaders from business, government, labour, civil society and international organisations. Held every year since June 2000, the OECD Forum takes the form of conferences and discussions, is open to public participation and is held in conjunction with the MCM.
  * Thematic Ministerial Meetings, held among ministers of a given domain (i.e., all Ministers of Labour, all Ministers of Environment, etc.).
  * The bi-annual World Forum on Statistics, Knowledge and Policies, which does not usually take place in the OECD. This series of meetings has the ambition to measure and foster progress in societies.
  * The Forum for Harmful Tax Practices
  * The Committee on Fiscal Affairs[_citation needed_]
  * OECD Eurasia Week, which includes several high-level policy dialogue discussions to share best practices and experiences in addressing common development and economic challenges in Eurasia.

### Secretariat

The exterior of the Château de la Muette and the grounds of the OECD
Conference Centre

Exchanges between OECD governments benefit from the information, analysis, and
preparation of the OECD Secretariat. The secretariat collects data, monitors
trends, and analyses and forecasts economic developments. Under the direction
and guidance of member governments, it also researches social changes or
evolving patterns in trade, environment, education, agriculture, technology,
taxation and other areas.

The secretariat is organised in directorates:

  * Centre for Entrepreneurship, SMEs, Regions and Cities
  * Centre for Tax Policy and Administration
  * Development Co-operation Directorate
  * Directorate for Education and Skills
  * Directorate for Employment, Labour, and Social Affairs
  * Directorate for Financial and Enterprise Affairs
  * Directorate for Science, Technology, and Innovation
  * Economics Department
  * Environment Directorate
  * Public Governance Directorate
  * Statistics Directorate
  * Trade and Agriculture Directorate
  * General Secretariat
  * Executive Directorate
  * Public Affairs and Communication Directorate

### Secretary-General

The head of the OECD Secretariat and chair of the OECD Council is the
Secretary-General. Secretary-General selections are made by consensus, meaning
all member states must agree on a candidate.

### Committees

A meeting room in the Château de la Muette

Representatives of member and observer countries meet in specialised
committees on specific policy areas, such as economics, trade, science,
employment, education, development assistance or financial markets. There are
about 200 committees, working groups and expert groups. Committees discuss
policies and review progress in the given policy area.

### Special bodies

The OECD has a number of specialised bodies:

  * Africa Partnership Forum
  * Blue Dot Network
  * Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC)
  * Development Assistance Committee
  * OECD Development Centre
  * International Transport Forum (ITF) (formerly known as the European Conference of Ministers of Transport)
  * International Energy Agency
  * Nuclear Energy Agency
  * Multilateral Organisation Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN)
  * Partnership for Democratic Governance (PDG)
  * Sahel and West Africa Club
  * Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC)

## Voting

OECD decisions are made through voting, which requires unanimity among all of
those voting. Each member country has one vote. However, dissenting members
which do not wish to block a decision but merely to signal their disapproval
can abstain from voting. 22 of the OECD member countries are also EU member
states.

## Member countries
