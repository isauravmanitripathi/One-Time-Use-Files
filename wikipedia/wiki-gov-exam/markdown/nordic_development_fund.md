The Nordic Development fund shares its offices with the Nordic Investment Bank
in Helsinki

The **Nordic Development Fund** is the joint multilateral development finance
institution of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. It was
established in 1989 and adheres to the development assistance policies of the
Nordic countries and has financed 190 development assistance credits valued at
EUR 1 billion. The NDF provides grants to climate change related investments
under its new mandate, established in 2009. NDF offices are located in
Helsinki, Finland.

The objective of the Nordic Development Fund's (NDF) operations is to
facilitate climate change investments in low-income countries. NDF grants are
made in cooperation with bilateral and multilateral development institutions.
NDF’s operations mirror the Nordic countries’ priorities in the areas of
climate change and poverty reduction. The operations are financed from the
development cooperation budgets of the five Nordic countries.
