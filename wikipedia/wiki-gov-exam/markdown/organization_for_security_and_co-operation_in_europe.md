Security-oriented intergovernmental organization

The **Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe** (**OSCE**) is a
regional security-oriented intergovernmental organization comprising member
states in Europe, North America, and Asia. Its mandate includes issues such as
arms control, the promotion of human rights, freedom of the press, and free
and fair elections. It employs around 3,460 people, mostly in its field
operations but also in its secretariat in Vienna, Austria, and its
institutions. It has observer status at the United Nations.

The OSCE had its origins in 1975: its predecessors came together during the
era of the Cold War to form a forum for discussion between the Western Bloc
and the Eastern Bloc. Most of its 57 participating countries are in Europe,
but with some members in Asia or in North America. The participating countries
comprise much of the land area of the Northern Hemisphere.

The OSCE is concerned with early warning, conflict prevention, crisis
management, and post-conflict rehabilitation.

## History

### Roots

Helmut Schmidt, Erich Honecker, Gerald Ford and Bruno Kreisky at the 1975 CSCE
summit in Helsinki, Finland

The Organization has its roots in the 1975 Conference on Security and Co-
operation in Europe (CSCE). Talks had been mooted about a European security
grouping since the 1950s but the Cold War prevented any substantial progress
until the talks at Dipoli in Espoo began in November 1972. These talks were
held at the suggestion of the Soviet Union which wished to use the talks to
maintain its control over the communist states in Eastern Europe, and
President of Finland Urho Kekkonen hosted them in order to bolster his policy
of neutrality. Western Europe, however, saw these talks as a way to reduce the
tension in the region, furthering economic cooperation and obtaining
humanitarian improvements for the populations of the communist bloc.

The recommendations of the talks, in the form of "The Blue Book", gave the
practical foundations for a three-stage conference called the "Helsinki
process". The CSCE opened in Helsinki on 3 July 1973 with 35 states sending
representatives. Stage I took only five days to agree to follow the Blue Book.
Stage II was the main working phase and was conducted in Geneva from 18
September 1973 until 21 July 1975.

The result of Stage II was the Helsinki Final Act. This was signed by the 35
participating states during Stage III, which took place in Finlandia Hall
between 30 July – 1 August 1975. It was opened by the Holy See's diplomat
Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, who was the chairman of the conference.

The concepts of improving relations and implementing the act were developed
over a series of follow-up meetings, with major gatherings in Belgrade (4
October 1977 – 8 March 1978), Madrid (11 November 1980 – 9 September 1983) and
Vienna (4 November 1986 – 19 January 1989).

The Copenhagen commitment was written "to ensure that individuals are
permitted to exercise their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of
association, including the right to form, join and participate effectively in
non-governmental organizations, which seek the promotion and protection of
human rights and fundamental freedoms."

The Moscow Mechanism was agreed in 1991.

### CSCE becomes OSCE

The fall of the Soviet Union required a change of role for the CSCE.[_why?_]
The Charter of Paris for a New Europe, signed on 21 November 1990, marked the
beginning of this change. The process was capped by the renaming of the CSCE
as the OSCE on 1 January 1995, in accordance with the results of a conference
held in Budapest in 1994. The OSCE now had a formal secretariat, a Senior
Council, a Parliamentary Assembly, a Conflict Prevention Centre, and an Office
for Free Elections, which later became the Office for Democratic Institutions
and Human Rights.

In December 1996, the "Lisbon Declaration on a Common and Comprehensive
Security Model for Europe for the Twenty-First Century" affirmed the universal
and indivisible nature of security on the European continent.

In Istanbul on 19 November 1999, the OSCE ended a two-day summit by calling
for a political settlement in Chechnya and adopting a Charter for European
Security.

Through its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), the
OSCE observes and assesses elections in its member states, in order to support
fair and transparent democratic processes, in keeping with the mutual
standards to which the organization is committed; between 1994 and 2004 the
OSCE sent teams of observers to monitor more than 150 elections, typically
focusing on elections in emerging democracies. In 2004, at the invitation of
the United States Government, the ODIHR deployed an assessment mission, made
up of participants from six OSCE member states, which observed that year's US
presidential election and produced a report. It was the first time that a US
presidential election was the subject of OSCE monitoring, although the
organization had previously monitored state-level American elections in
Florida and California, in 2002 and 2003.

#### Criticism of OSCE

Members of OSCE have criticized the organization for being in a position where
Russia, and sometimes Belarus, can veto all OSCE decisions, Moscow has, for a
number of years, not allowed the approval of the organization's budget, the
organization of official OSCE events or the extension of missions. In November
2023 they vetoed the appointment of Estonia as chairman for 2024.

### OSCE missions and operations

#### 1992 Georgia Mission

The OSCE Mission to Georgia was established in November 1992 with its
headquarters in the capital Tbilisi. The Mission's mandate expired on 31
December 2008. Between these dates it was powerless to control the outbreak of
the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war.

#### 1993 Mission to Moldova

The objective of the mission to Moldova is to facilitate a comprehensive and
lasting political settlement of the Transnistria conflict in all its aspects,
strengthening the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Moldova within its internationally recognized borders with a
special status for Transnistria.

OSCE promoted a 5+2 format as a diplomatic negotiation platform, which began
in 2005, suspended by Russia and Transnistria in 2006 until it started again
in 2012, before making slow progress over the next ten years. The process
stopped following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine as two of the parties
were then at war with each other.

In December 2022 Russia blocked the renewal of the annual mandate by limiting
it to a six-month period, repeated again in June 2023 to another six-month
period.

#### 1995 Mission to Bosnia and Herzegovina

The Bosnian War concluded in 1995 with the Dayton Agreement with the ongoing
OSCE Mission being mandated to help secure lasting peace and therefore to
build a stable, secure, and democratic state through building sustainable
democratic institutions, strengthening good governance and human rights
principles, and supporting the development of a multi-national and multi-
ethnic democratic society.

#### 1998 Kosovo Mission

The OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission was established by the Permanent Council
in October 1998 and shuttered in June 1999 amidst the recalcitrance of the
Milosevic regime.[_citation needed_]

The 1999 OSCE Mission in Kosovo took over the work in Kosovo where it
concentrates on institution and democracy building, as well as human rights.

The OSCE's refusal to police events surrounding the 2008 Kosovo declaration of
independence still rankles in Russia.

#### 2001 Mission to Macedonia

The ongoing Mission to Macedonia is monitoring and supporting the
implementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement that put an end to the 2001
armed conflict in North Macedonia.

#### 2001 Mission to Serbia

The current mission to Serbia started after Slobodan Milošević lost his power
as President of Serbia and Montenegro in 2000. The mission was mandated to
assist the authorities and civil society with democratic development and human
rights protection, including the rights of persons belonging to national
minorities. To promote democratisation, tolerance and the rule of law.

#### 2006 Mission to Montenegro

The current mission began with the 2006 Montenegrin independence referendum,
monitored by OSCE, with a mandate being granted with the objective of
assisting and promoting the implementation of OSCE principles and commitments
including the politico-military and human aspects of security and stability.

#### 2012 Texas election

Before the U.S. presidential elections of November 2012, the OSCE announced
its intention to send electoral observers to Texas and to other U.S. states.
This prompted the Attorney General of Texas Greg Abbott to send letters to
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and to the OSCE, threatening to arrest
OSCE officials if they should enter electoral premises in Texas and break
Texas law. In reply, the U.S. Department of State stated that OSCE observers
enjoyed immunities. In the event, no incidents between OSCE and Texas
authorities were recorded during the elections.

#### 2017 Turkey constitutional referendum

In April 2017, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan criticized the OSCE for
reporting that opposition "No" campaigners in the Turkish constitutional
referendum had faced bans, police interventions and arrests. Erdoğan said:
"Now the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe says if the
result is 'yes', that means there are a lot of problems. Who are you? First of
all, you should know your place. This is not your duty."

#### OSCE involvement in Ukraine (2014–2021)

OSCE SMM monitoring the movement of heavy weaponry in eastern Ukraine

On 21 March 2014, the OSCE deployed its Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine
at the request of Ukraine's government. The mission has received mixed
reviews. While some observers have applauded its function as the "eyes and
ears of the international community", others have accused the mission of bias
towards either Russia or Ukraine.

On 27 April 2014, the Girkin group that had taken control in the city of
Sloviansk took eight members of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (OSCE SMM)
as hostages. The group appointed Vyacheslav Ponomarev as mayor of the city.

During the war in Donbas, an OSCE observer allowed Russian separatists to
travel in a vehicle with the organization's markings; this prompted
allegations that the OSCE was biased in the war and not interested in carrying
out its duties of mediating a ceasefire. The organization issued a statement
regretting the incident.

Moreover, the OSCE Observer Mission at Russian Checkpoints Gukovo and Donetsk
(which is organizationally separate from the Special Monitoring Mission) also
received criticism alleging that only two checkpoints on the Russian–Ukrainian
border are currently being monitored, which Daniel Baer, the US ambassador to
the OSCE at the time, described as "seriously inadequate".

The mission has been criticized for taking months to deploy drones to help
monitor borders as well as withdrawing them after only several weeks of use
due to Russian electronic attacks. Drones have been reintroduced to observe
the conflict in 2018.

In 2014, an advisor to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence wrongly claimed that
approximately 80% of the OSCE observers located near Mariupol were Russian
citizens and that many had ties to Russian security agencies such as the FSB
and the GRU. In reality, one observer out of 17 in Mariupol was a Russian
citizen. In total, the mission reports the number of Russian citizens in its
ranks as 39 out of 720, or 5,4%. The organization has also been accused of
allegedly revealing the locations of Ukrainian troops to Russian forces during
the conflict.

On 1 December 2014, the mission was in the area to "facilitate a local
ceasefire and monitor the repair works on a power station", that it "heard an
exchange of artillery fire between unspecified parties", and that "artillery
rounds were impacting at approximately 1km to the east of the SMM's position;
therefore the SMM left due to security concerns". Furthermore, the report
states that the "SMM team in the JCCC was in constant contact with the SMM
team in Staromikhailivka". No mention of a wounded observer is made.

On 27 October 2015, a suspended OSCE monitor confirmed he had been a former
employee of Russia's Main Intelligence Directorate. The suspended SMM stated
that he had no trouble receiving the position and neither the OSCE nor
Ukraine's Security Service thoroughly checked his background. Following the
report the OSCE issued a comment stating the monitor had been fired due to
violations of the organization's code of conduct.

On 6 April 2016, photos of OSCE monitors attending the wedding of a Russian
separatist emerged. The wedding had taken place in June 2015. The OSCE
expressed regret over the incident, issuing a statement saying "The
unprofessional behaviour displayed by the monitors in the picture is an
individual incident that should not be abused to cast a shadow on the
reputation of other mission members." The OSCE reported that the monitors were
no longer with the OSCE special monitoring mission.

In April 2017, an OSCE vehicle struck a mine, which killed one SMM member and
injured two. Two armoured vehicles were on patrol near Luhansk when one struck
the mine. The dead man was an American paramedic, while the injured included a
woman from Germany and a man from the Czech Republic.

On 18 July 2018, the German broadcaster ARD reported that Russian intelligence
services had received inside information about the activities of the OSCE
Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine from a staff member of the OSCE. The
insider information consisted of observers' preferences in alcohol and women,
their financial situation, and their contacts in Ukraine. The OSCE issued a
statement expressing concern over the alleged security breach.

Russia has accused members of the Mission of working for the Ukrainian SBU and
of spying on the pro-Russian separatists. Furthermore, Russia has accused the
mission of bias after it reported troop movements from separatist forces,
accusing the mission of ignoring similar moves from Ukraine. Russia's foreign
minister also has claimed that the mission failed to pay sufficient attention
to human and minority rights within the Government-controlled areas of
Ukraine. Furthermore, he criticised that the mission did not clearly attribute
ceasefire violations to either side.

#### 2022 Mission to Armenia

An OSCE Needs Assessment Team was sent to Armenia between 21 and 27 October
2022 following the Armenia–Azerbaijan border crisis. The request was made by
the government of Armenia. The OSCE sent international experts to monitor the
Armenia–Azerbaijan border.

#### OSCE involvement in Ukraine (2022–present)

The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine began on 24 February. The OSCE mandate in
Ukraine expired on 31 March 2022, due to objections by Russia. On 24 April
2022, the OSCE protested the detention of four staff members in Donetsk and
Luhansk, without specifying who had detained them. On 20 September, two
Ukrainian OSCE staffers were sentenced to 13 years of prison by a court in the
Luhansk People's Republic for "alleged high treason and espionage for the
United States."

In March 2022, 45 participating States promoted, with the support of Ukraine,
the activation of the Moscow Mechanism for the establishment of an independent
expert mission on violations and abuses committed in the war of the Russian
Federation, supported by Belarus, against Ukraine. The report of the Mission
of Experts was presented to the OSCE Permanent Council on 13 April 2022 and
documented clear patterns of violations of international humanitarian law by
the Russian Armed Forces in Ukraine. OSCE/ODIHR continues to monitor the
violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights
law in Ukraine.

On 2 June 2022, the same 45 participating States invoked again the Moscow
Mechanism to establish a new mission of experts to consider, follow up and
build upon the findings of the Moscow Mechanism report published in April
2022. The subsequent report, presented on 14 July 2022 to the OSCE Permanent
Council, confirmed the outcomes of the previous mission and identified blatant
violations of international humanitarian law, mainly attributable to the
Russian armed forces, as well as widespread violations of human rights,
especially in the territories under effective control of the Russian
Federation.

The Russian delegation was not invited to the 29th OSCE Ministerial Council in
December 2022 where the delegates considered the ramifications and regional
security challenges created by Russia's continued war against Ukraine. There
were calls to assess the reparations that Russia should be accountable for.

Since the start of its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has seized €2.7 million
worth of armored vehicles that were previously part of the OSCE Special
Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. According to a letter that was sent by Russian
OSCE representatives to OSCE Secretary-General Helga Schmid in January 2023,
71 trucks and cars were brought to the Luhansk People's Republic and the
Donetsk People's Republic as "evidence" and criminal proceedings were
initiated against former OSCE personnel for espionage.

## OSCE Parliamentary Assembly

In 2004, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sent election observers to the U.S.
presidential elections. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's president at the
time was Democratic Congressman Alcee Hastings. Hastings had previously been
impeached for corruption by the U.S. Congress. The OSCE faced criticism of
partisanship and double standards due to Hastings's past and the fact that the
OSCE's mandate was to promote democracy and the values of civil society.

In 2010, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-
operation in Europe was criticized from within by the Latvian delegation for
lacking transparency and democracy. Spencer Oliver (b. 1938) secretary general
of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, who held the post from the organization's
inception in 1992 until 2015, faced a challenge from the Latvian Artis
Pabriks. According to the rules of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, the
incumbent general secretary can only be replaced with a full consensus minus
one. Pabriks called the rules "quite shocking from the perspective of an
organization that's monitoring elections".

## Role of Civil Society Organizations at the OSCE Human Dimension Conference

The **Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE)** hosts the
**Human Dimension Conference** , a key platform for dialogue on human rights,
democratic institutions, and the rule of law across the OSCE region. Civil
society organizations (CSOs) play a critical role in the conference by
contributing expertise, raising awareness, and advocating for the protection
of fundamental freedoms.

Through their participation, CSOs may attend plenary sessions, submit written
statements, deliver oral interventions, and organize side events addressing
issues such as human rights violations, civic space, and rule-of-law
challenges. Their presence helps elevate international attention to pressing
human rights concerns and ensures that the voices of grassroots actors are
represented in regional dialogue.

**Participation Procedure**

CSOs seeking to attend the Human Dimension Conference must undergo a formal
**registration process** , administered by the **OSCE Office for Democratic
Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)**. ODIHR provides detailed guidance on
the application process, including eligibility requirements and procedural
steps.

All necessary information regarding registration and participation—including
deadlines, documentation, and logistical details—is made available on the
OSCE’s official website. For the 2024 Human Dimension Conference, details and
registration materials can be accessed at:

A unique aspect of the OSCE is the non-binding status of its constitutive
charter. Rather than being a formal treaty ratified by national legislatures,
the Helsinki Final Act represents a political commitment by the heads of
government of all signatories to build security and cooperation in Europe on
the basis of its provisions. This allows the OSCE to remain a flexible
_process_ for the evolution of improved cooperation, which avoids disputes
and/or sanctions over implementation.

By agreeing to these commitments, signatories for the first time accepted that
the treatment of citizens _within_ their borders was also a matter of
legitimate international concern. This open process of the OSCE is often given
credit for helping build democracy in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe,
thus leading to the end of the Cold War.[_citation needed_] Unlike most
international intergovernmental organizations, however, the OSCE does not have
international legal personality on account of the lack of legal effect of its
charter. As a result, its headquarters' host, Austria, had to confer legal
personality on the organization in order to be able to sign a legal agreement
regarding its presence in Vienna.

## Structure and institutions

Political direction to the organization is given by heads of state or
government during summits. Summits are not regular or scheduled but held as
needed. The last summit took place in Astana (Kazakhstan), on 1 and 2 December
2010. The high-level decision-making body of the organization is the OSCE
Ministerial Council, which meets at the end of every year. At the
ambassadorial level, the OSCE Permanent Council convenes weekly in Vienna and
serves as the regular negotiating and decision-making body. The chairman of
the Permanent Council is the ambassador to the Organization of the
participating State which holds the chairmanship.

In addition to the Ministerial Council and Permanent Council, the Forum for
Security Co-operation is also an OSCE decision-making body. It deals
predominantly with matters of military co-operation, such as modalities for
inspections according to the Vienna Document of 1999.

The OSCE's Secretariat is located in Vienna, Austria. The organization also
has offices in Copenhagen, Geneva, The Hague, Prague and Warsaw.

A meeting of the OSCE Permanent Council at the Hofburg in Vienna, Austria

As of October 2021[update], the OSCE employed 3,568 staff, including 609 in
its secretariat and institutions and 2,959 in its 17 field operations.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation
in Europe is made up of 323 parliamentarians from 57 member states. The
Parliamentary Assembly performs its functions mainly via the Standing
Committee, the Bureau, and 3 General Committees (Committee on Political
Affairs and Security, Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and
Environment, and Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian
Questions).

The Parliamentary Assembly passes resolutions on matters such as political and
security affairs, economic and environmental issues, and democracy and human
rights. Representing the collective voice of OSCE parliamentarians, these
resolutions and recommendations are meant to ensure that all participating
states live up to their OSCE commitments. The Parliamentary Assembly also
engages in parliamentary diplomacy, and has an extensive election observation
program.

The Młodziejowski Palace in Warsaw, the seat of the ODIHR

The oldest OSCE institution is the Office for Democratic Institutions and
Human Rights (ODIHR), established in 1991 following a decision made at the
1990 Summit of Paris. It is based in Warsaw, Poland, and is active throughout
the OSCE area in the fields of election observation, democratic development,
human rights, tolerance and non-discrimination, rule of law, and Roma and
Sinti issues. The ODIHR has observed over 300 elections and referendums since
1995, sending more than 50,000 observers. It has operated outside its own area
twice, sending a team that offered technical support to the 9 October 2004
presidential elections in Afghanistan, an OSCE Partner for Co-operation, and
an election support team to assist with parliamentary and provincial council
elections on 18 September 2005. ODIHR is headed by Matteo Mecacci, Italy.

The Office of the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, established in
December 1997, acts as a watchdog to provide early warning on violations of
freedom of expression in OSCE participating States. The representative also
assists participating States by advocating and promoting full compliance with
OSCE norms, principles and commitments regarding freedom of expression and
free media. As of 2020, the current representative is Teresa Ribeiro,
Portugal.

The High Commissioner on National Minorities was created on 8 July 1992 by the
Helsinki Summit Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. It is charged with identifying and seeking early resolution of ethnic
tension that might endanger peace, stability or friendly relations between
participating states. As of 2020, the current representative is Kairat
Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan).

Each year the OSCE holds an OSCE Asian Conference with partner nations
(currently Australia, Thailand, South Korea, Japan and Afghanistan).

The OSCE and the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic established the OSCE
Academy in 2002. The aim of the OSCE Academy is "to promote regional
cooperation, conflict prevention and good governance in Central Asia through
offering post-graduate education, professional training and intellectual
exchange."

## Chairmanship

OSCE Permanent Council venue at the Hofburg, Vienna

The OSCE chairmanship is assumed at yearly intervals by one participating
state, which then plays the central role in managing the organization's work
and in its external representation. The foreign minister of the country
possessing the chair holds the OSCE's most senior position as chairman-in-
office (CiO).

The responsibilities of the chairman-in-office include:

  * co-ordination of the work of OSCE institutions;
  * representing the OSCE;
  * supervising activities related to conflict prevention, crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation.

The CiO is assisted by the previous and incoming chairmen-in-office; the three
of them together constitute the OSCE Troika. The CiO nominates personal
representatives – experts in fields of priority for the CiO. The origin of the
institution lies with the Charter of Paris for a New Europe (1990), and the
Helsinki Document (1992) formally institutionalized this function.

The OSCE chair for 2022 was Poland, with Zbigniew Rau serving as chairman-in-
office. The chair for 2023 is North Macedonia, represented by Bujar Osmani as
chairman-in-office.

### Chairmanship history

Chairmanship of the OSCE is held by a member state on a calendar-year basis,
with the minister for foreign affairs of that state performing the function of
chairman-in-office. The table below shows the holders since 1991. Estonia was
due to hold the chairmanship in 2024, however, this was not approved following

## Relations with the United Nations

The OSCE considers itself a regional organization in the sense of Chapter VIII
of the United Nations Charter and is an observer in the United Nations General
Assembly. The Chairman-in-Office gives routine briefings to the United Nations
Security Council.

## The three dimensions

### Politico-military dimension (first dimension)

OSCE Chair-in-Office Ian Borg with Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev in
February 2024

The OSCE takes a comprehensive approach to the politico-military dimension of
security, which includes a number of commitments by participating States and
mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. The organization also seeks
to enhance military security by promoting greater openness, transparency and
co-operation.

Arms control

The end of the Cold War resulted in a huge amount of surplus weapons becoming
available in what is known as the international grey market for weapons. The
OSCE helps to stop the—often illegal—spread of such weapons and offers
assistance with their destruction. The OSCE hosts the annual exchange of
information under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. The OSCE has also
implemented two additional exchanges of information, the Vienna Document and
the Global Exchange of Military Information. The Open Skies Consultative
Commission, the implementing body for the Treaty on Open Skies, meets monthly
at its Vienna headquarters.

Border management

The actions taken by the OSCE in border monitoring range from conflict
prevention to post-conflict management, capacity building and institutional
support.

Combating terrorism

With its expertise in conflict prevention, crisis management and early
warning, the OSCE contributes to worldwide efforts in combating terrorism.

Conflict prevention

The OSCE works to prevent conflicts from arising and to facilitate lasting
comprehensive political settlements for existing conflicts. It also helps with
the process of rehabilitation in post-conflict areas.

Military reform

The OSCE's Forum for Security Co-operation provides a framework for political
dialogue on military reform, while practical activities are conducted by field
operations, as well as the Conflict Prevention Centre.

Policing

OSCE police operations are an integral part of the organization's efforts in
conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

Implementation

The OSCE was a rather small organization until selection by the international
community to provide electoral organization to post war Bosnia and Herzegovina
in early 1996. Ambassador Frowick was the first OSCE representative to
initiate national election in September 1996, human rights issues and rule of
law specifically designed to provide a foundation for judicial organization
within Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The OSCE had regional offices and field offices, to include the office in
Brcko in northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina which remained in limbo until the
Brcko Arbitration Agreement could be decided, finalized and implemented.

Brcko become a "special district" and remains so today.

The OSCE essentially took the place of the United Nations in Bosnia and
Herzegovina in part because the Bosnian leadership felt deep contempt for the
UN efforts to stop the war which began in 1991 and ended in 1995. During the
time the United Nations were attempting a political solution, thousands of UN
troops were posted in and around Bosnia and Herzegovina with special emphasis
on Sarajevo. From 1991 to 1995, over 200,000 Bosnians were killed and over one
million displaced and another million as refugees.

The OSCE continues to have a presence and a number of initiatives to bring a
sustained peace to the region.

### Economic and environmental dimension (second dimension)

Activities in the economic and environmental dimension include the monitoring
of developments related to economic and environmental security in OSCE
participating States, with the aim of alerting them to any threat of conflict;
assisting States in the creation of economic and environmental policies,
legislation and institutions to promote security in the OSCE region.

Economic activities

Among the economic activities of the OSCE feature activities related to
migration management, transport and energy security. Most activities are
implemented in co-operation with partner organizations.

Environmental activities

The OSCE has developed a range of activities in the environmental sphere aimed
at addressing ecologic threats to security in its participating States. Among
the activities feature projects in the area of hazardous waste, water
management and access to information under the Aarhus Convention.

### Human dimension (third dimension)

The commitments made by OSCE participating States in the human dimension aim
to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; to abide by
the rule of law; to promote the principles of democracy by building,
strengthening and protecting democratic institutions; and to promote tolerance
throughout the OSCE region.

Combating trafficking in human beings

Since 2003, the OSCE has had an established mechanism for combating
trafficking in human beings, as defined by Article 3 of the Palermo Protocol,
which is aimed at raising public awareness of the problem and building the
political will within participating states to tackle it effectively.

The OSCE actions against trafficking in human beings are coordinated by the
Office of the Special Representative and Co-ordinator for Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings. Maria Grazia Giammarinaro, a judge in the
Criminal Court of Rome, took Office as the Special Representative in March
2010. From 2006 to 2009, this Office was held by Eva Biaudet, a former Finnish
Minister of Health and Social Services. Biaudet currently serves as Finnish
Ombudsman for Minorities. Her predecessor was former Austrian Minister Helga
Konrad, who served as the first OSCE Special Representative for Combating
Trafficking in Human Beings.

The activities around Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region
of the Office of the Special Representative include:

  * Co-operation with governments, helping them to accept and act on their responsibilities for curbing trafficking in human beings;
  * Providing governments with decision and policy-making aids and offering guidance on anti-trafficking management, with the aim of arriving at solutions tailored to the needs of the individual countries and in line with international standards;
  * Assisting governments to develop the national anti-trafficking structures required for efficient internal and transnational co-operation;
  * Raising awareness to draw attention to the complexity of the problem and to the need for comprehensive solutions;
  * Considering all dimensions of human trafficking, namely trafficking for sexual exploitation, trafficking for forced and bonded labour, including domestic servitude, trafficking into forced marriages, trafficking in organs and trafficking in children;
  * Ensuring the effective interaction of all agents and stake holders involved in the fight against human trafficking, ranging from governmental authorities, law enforcement officials to NGOs, and—last but not least—international organizations, as the agencies providing support thorough expertise and know-how;
  * Guaranteeing the highest possible visibility of the OSCE's fight against human trafficking to focus attention on the issue.

Democratization

The OSCE claims to promote democracy and assist the participating states in
building democratic institutions.

Education

Education programmes are an integral part of the organization's efforts in
conflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation.

Elections

As part of its democratization activities, the OSCE carries out election
assistance projects in the run-up to, during, and following elections.
However, the effectiveness of such assistance is arguable—Kazakhstan, for
example, despite being the former chair of the OSCE, is considered by many to
be one of the least democratic countries in the world. Moreover, the recent
democratic advances made in other Central Asian republics, notably Kyrgyzstan,
have led to rumours of Soviet-style disruption of the Kyrgyz democratic
process by, in particular, Kazakhstan and Russia. This may be in large part
due to fears over the long-term stability of these countries' own quasi-
dictatorships.

Gender equality

The equality of men and women is an integral part of sustainable democracy.
The OSCE aims to provide equal opportunities for men and women and to
integrate gender equality in policies and practices.

Human rights

The OSCE's human rights activities focus on such priorities as freedom of
movement and religion, preventing torture and trafficking in persons.

National and international NGOs

OSCE could grant consultive status to NGOs and INGOs in the form of
"Researcher-in-residence programme" (run by the Prague Office of the OSCE
Secretariat): accredited representatives of national and international NGOs
are granted access to all records and to numerous topical compilations related
to OSCE field activities.

Media freedom

The OSCE observes relevant media developments in its participating states with
a view to addressing and providing early warning on violations of freedom of
expression.

Minority rights

Ethnic conflict is one of the main sources of large-scale violence in Europe
today. The OSCE's approach is to identify and to seek early resolution of
ethnic tensions, and to set standards for the rights of persons belonging to
minority groups and High Commissioner on National Minorities has been
established.

## OSCE Democracy Defender Award

The Democracy Defender Award honors a person or group for contributions to the
promotion of democracy and the defense of human rights "in the spirit of
Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE principles and commitments." The award was
established in 2016 on the initiative of Ambassadors of 8 countries, and
supported by the delegations of the 18 countries of the OSCE (22 countries in
2017).
