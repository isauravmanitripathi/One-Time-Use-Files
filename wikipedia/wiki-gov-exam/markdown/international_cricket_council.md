The **International Cricket Council** (**ICC**) is the global governing body
of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by
representatives from Australia, England, and South Africa. In 1965, the body
was renamed as the International Cricket Conference and adopted its current
name in 1987. ICC has its headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

The ICC currently has 110 member nations : 12 full members that play Test
matches, and 98 associate members. Timor-Leste Cricket Federation being the
latest addition as associate member in 2025. The ICC is responsible for the
organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most
notably the Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and ICC World Test Championship.
It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned
Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. It
promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of
discipline for international cricket, and also co-ordinates action against
corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit.

The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries, which
include all Test matches outside of the World Test Championship Final, and
neither does it govern domestic cricket within member countries. It does not
make or alter the laws of the game, which have remained under the governance
of Marylebone Cricket Club since 1788.

The Chairman heads the board of directors, and on 26 June 2014 Narayanaswami
Srinivasan, the former president of Board of Control for Cricket in India
(BCCI), was announced as the first chairman of the council. The role of ICC
president became a largely honorary position after the establishment of the
chairman role and other changes made to the ICC constitution in 2014. It has
been claimed that the 2014 changes have handed control to the 'Big Three'
nations of England, India and Australia. The last ICC president was Zaheer
Abbas, who was appointed in June 2015 following the resignation of Mustafa
Kamal in April 2015. When the post of ICC president was abolished in April
2016, Shashank Manohar, who replaced Srinivasan in October 2015, became the
first independent elected chairman of the ICC. Sanjog Gupta became the seventh
CEO of the International Cricket Council on July 7, 2025, succeeding Jay Shah.
His role involves managing T20 league growth, sustaining cricket formats,
promoting Olympic inclusion, and expanding global engagement.

## History

### 1909–1963 – Imperial Cricket Conference

On 30 November 1907, Abe Bailey, the President of the South African Cricket
Association, wrote a letter to the Marylebone Cricket Club's (MCC, England)
secretary, Francis Lacey. Bailey suggested the formation of an 'Imperial
Cricket Board'. In the letter, he suggested that the board would be
responsible for the formulation of rules and regulations that would govern the
bilateral international matches of the three members, Australia, England and
South Africa. Bailey wanted to host a Triangular Test series among the
participant countries in South Africa. However, Australia rejected the offer.
Still, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three
members together during Australia's tour of England in 1909. After continued
lobbying and efforts, Bailey was successful.

On 15 June 1909, representatives from England, Australia and South Africa met
at Lord's and founded the _Imperial Cricket Conference_. A month later, a
second meeting between the three members was held. The rules were agreed upon
amongst the nations, and the first-ever Tri-Test series was decided to be held
in England in 1912.

In 1926, West Indies, New Zealand and India were elected as Full Members,
doubling the number of Test-playing nations to six. After the formation of
Pakistan in 1947, it was given Test status five years later in 1952, becoming
the seventh Test-playing, nation. In May 1961, South Africa left the
Commonwealth and therefore lost membership.

### 1964–1988 – International Cricket Conference

In 1964, the ICC agreed to include non-Test playing countries. The following
year, the ICC changed its name to the International Cricket Conference. The
US, Ceylon (who later became Sri Lanka} and Fiji were admitted as Associates,
a new class of members. In 1968, Denmark, Bermuda, Netherlands, and East
Africa were admitted as Associates, while South Africa had still not applied
to rejoin the ICC.

In 1969, the basic rules of ICC were amended. At the 1971 meeting, the idea of
organizing a World Cup was introduced. At the 1973 meeting, it was decided
that a World Cup would be played in 1975 in England. The six Test playing
nations and East Africa and Sri Lanka were invited to take part.

New members were added frequently during this period: Israel and Singapore in
1974, West Africa in 1976, Bangladesh in 1977, Papua-New Guinea in 1978, were
admitted as Associates. South Africa applied to rejoin, but their application
was rejected.

In 1981, Sri Lanka was promoted to a Full Member, and they played their first
Test in 1982.

In 1984, a third class of membership (Affiliate) was introduced. Italy was the
first such member, followed by Switzerland in 1985. In 1987, Bahamas and
France were admitted, followed by Nepal in 1988.

### 1989–present – International Cricket Council

At the July 1989 meeting, the ICC renamed itself as the International Cricket
Council, and the tradition of the MCC President automatically becoming the
Chairman of ICC was abolished.

In 1990, UAE joined as an Associate.

In 1991, for the first time in ICC history, the meeting was held away from
England, in Melbourne, Australia. South Africa was re-elected as a Full Member
of the ICC in July, following the end of apartheid.

In 1992, Zimbabwe was admitted as the ninth Full Member. Namibia joined as an
Associate member. Austria, Belgium, Brunei and Spain all joined as Affiliates.

In 1993, the position of _Chief Executive of ICC_ was created; David Richards
of the Australian Cricket Board was the first person appointed to the
position. In July, Sir Clyde Walcott, from Barbados, was elected as the first
non-British Chairman. The emergence of new technology saw the introduction of
a third umpire who was equipped with video playback facilities. By 1995, TV
replays were made available for run-outs and stumpings in Test matches, with
the third umpire required to signal out or not out with red and green lights
respectively. The following year, the cameras were used to determine if the
ball had crossed the boundary. In 1997 decisions on the cleanness of catches
could be referred to the third umpire. This year also saw the introduction of
the Duckworth-Lewis method, a way of adjusting targets in rain-affected ODI
matches.

In 2000, Bangladesh was admitted as the tenth Full Member of the International
Cricket Council.

In 2005, ICC moved its new headquarters to Dubai.

In 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland were admitted as the eleventh and twelfth
Full Members of the International Cricket Council after a unanimous vote at
the ICC Full Council meeting at The Oval. Affiliate Membership was also
abolished, with all existing Affiliate Members becoming Associate Members.

In 2018, all Women's T20 matches were elevated to Women's Twenty20
International status. In 2019, all Men's T20 matches were elevated to Twenty20
International status.

In July 2022, Cambodia, Cote D'Ivoire, and Uzbekistan were granted associate
member status by the ICC.

## Location

The ICC's offices in Dubai

Since its creation, the ICC had the Lord's Cricket Ground as its home, and in
1993 moved its offices to the "Clock Tower" building at the nursery end of the
ground. The independently run ICC was funded initially by commercial
exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket.
As not all Member countries had double-tax agreements with the United Kingdom,
it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC
Development (International) Pvt. Ltd, known as IDI outside the UK. This was
established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco [_This paragraph needs
citation(s)_].

For the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest
affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from
2001 to 2008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member
countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial
staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the
council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from
their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of
bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their
commercial income from tax.[_This paragraph needs citation(s)_]

The option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made,
through Sport England, to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all
its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London – but
be given special exemption from paying UK corporation tax on its commercial
income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would
not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations
and eventually settled on the city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The
ICC is also registered in British Virgin Islands. In August 2005, the ICC
moved its offices to Dubai, and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and
Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11–1 vote by the ICC's executive
board in favour.

While the principal driver of the ICC's move to Dubai was the wish to bring
its main employees together in one tax-efficient location, a secondary reason
was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres
of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the
ICC had been administered by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (a situation
that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world
cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British
private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct
consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be
the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.

## Income generation

Variant ICC Logo with old motto

The ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the
Cricket World Cup, and it distributes the majority of that income to its
members. Sponsorship and television rights of the World Cup brought in over
US$1.6 billion between 2007 and 2015, by far the ICC's main source of income.
In the nine-month accounting period to 31 December 2007 the ICC had operating
income of $12.66 million, mainly from member subscriptions and sponsorship. In
contrast, event income was US$285.87 million, including $239 million from the
2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the
period. In 2022 ICC generated US$208,375,000 as an net income.

The ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches
(Test matches, One Day International and Twenty20 Internationals), that
account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they
are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to
augment its World Cup revenues. These include the ICC Champions Trophy and the
ICC Super Series played in Australia in 2005. However, these events have not
been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a
failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions
Trophy to be scrapped in 2006. The Champions Trophy 2004 event was referred to
in _Wisden 2005_ by the editor as a "turkey of a tournament" and a "fiasco";
although the 2006 event was seen as a greater success due to a new format.

The ICC World Twenty20, first played in 2007, was a success. The ICC's current
plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World
Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year
before the Olympic Games, and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year
of the cycle. This arrangement began in 2022.

## Rules and regulation

The International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling
reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the
_Laws of Cricket_ : only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually
done in consultation with the game's global governing body.[_citation needed_]
The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which
make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a "Code of Conduct" to
which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where
breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In
2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players. ICC announces changes to
Playing Conditions.

## Umpires and referees

The ICC appoints international umpires and match referees who officiate at all
sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.
The ICC operates three panels of umpires: the Elite Panel, the International
Panel, and the Associates and Affiliates Panel.

As of March 2012, the Elite Panel included twelve umpires. In theory, two
umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite
Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the
International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in
occasional Test matches, as this is viewed an excellent good opportunity to
see whether they can cope at the Test level and whether they should be
elevated to the Elite Panel. Members of the Elite Panel are full-time
employees of the ICC, although they do still, very occasionally, umpire first-
class cricket in their country of residence. The average annual officiating
schedule for Elite Umpires is 8–10 Test matches and 10–15 ODIs, a potential
on-field workload of 75 days per year, plus travel and preparation time.

The International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten
Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in
their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket
calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches.
International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such
as the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup to improve their knowledge and
understanding of overseas condition, and help them prepare for possible
promotion to the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the
Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a "third umpire"
who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant
television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own
country, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then
the Elite Panel.

The inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was
formed in June 2006. It superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate
International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for
umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of
the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.

Members of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are
eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC
Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments.
High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including
the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in
the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.

There is also an Elite Panel of ICC Referees who act as the independent
representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it
had 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The
Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be
done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under
the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging
from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be
appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.

The Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket-playing nations – as
of June 2012 – on the universal application of an Umpire's Decision Review
System, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to
mutual agreement of the playing countries. In July 2012, ICC decided to send a
delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Ed Rosten, an expert on
computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the skepticism about the use
of DRS technology.

## Awards

The ICC has instituted the **ICC Awards** to recognize and honor the best
international cricket players of the previous 12 months. The inaugural ICC
Awards ceremony was held on 7 September 2004, in London. In 2020, ICC
announced a special one-off event, the **ICC Awards of the Decade** to honour
the best performers and performances in the previous 10 years.

The ICC Development Awards were established in 2002 to celebrate the world-
leading initiatives and innovative programmes delivered by ICC Members to grow
the game around the globe.

## Anti-corruption and security

The ICC has also had to deal with drugs and bribery scandals involving top
cricketers. Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the
legal and illegal bookmaking markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and
Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired Commissioner of London's
Metropolitan Police, Lord Condon. Among the corruption on which they have
reported was that of former South African captain Hansie Cronje who had
accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-
performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result.
Similarly, the former Indian captain Mohammad Azharuddin and Ajay Jadeja were
investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket
(for life and for five years, respectively). The ACSU continues to monitor and
investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been
introduced, which for example prohibit the use of mobile telephones in
dressing rooms.

Prior to the 2007 Cricket World Cup, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed warned
against any corruption and stated that the ICC would be vigilant and
intolerant against it.

Following a scandal that occurred during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3
Pakistani players, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif and Salman Butt were found to
be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years
respectively. On 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 30 months for
Butt, one year for Asif, six months for Amir and two years and eight months
for Majeed, the sports agent that facilitated the bribes.

In 2019, an investigation by Al Jazeera revealed match-fixing in Sri-Lanka,
India, England, Australia and other cricket playing nations. The ICC launched
an investigation corcerning the report.

## Global Cricket Academy

The ICC Global Cricket Academy (GCA) is located at Dubai Sports City in the
United Arab Emirates. The GCA's facilities include two ovals, each with 10
turf pitches, outdoor turf and synthetic practice facilities, indoor practice
facilities including hawk eye technology and a cricket-specific gymnasium. Rod
Marsh has been appointed as the academy's Director of Coaching. The opening,
originally planned for 2008, took place in 2010.

## ICC Cricket World Program

The International Cricket Council telecasts a weekly program on television
called ICC Cricket World. It is produced by Sportsbrand.

It is a weekly 30-minute program providing the latest cricket news, recent
cricket action including all Test and One-Day International matches, as well
as off-field features and interviews.

## Criticism

In 2015, Sam Collins and Jarrod Kimber made the documentary _Death of a
Gentleman_ on the internal organisation of the ICC, saying that the richer
member countries (specifically India, England and Australia) were "bullying"
the ICC and running the organisation to the detriment of the other members.
