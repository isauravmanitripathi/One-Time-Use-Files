Chair and presiding officer of the General Assembly

The **president of the United Nations General Assembly** is a position voted
by representatives in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) on a yearly
basis. The president is the chair and presiding officer of the General
Assembly.

## Election

A map of the world showing the home countries of presidents of the United
Nations General Assembly up until the 76th session of the General Assembly in
2021–22, with historical member states in inset.

The session of the assembly is scheduled for every year starting in
September—any special, or emergency special, assemblies over the next year
will be headed by the president of the UNGA.

The presidency rotates annually between the five geographic groups: African,
Asia-Pacific, Eastern European, Latin American and Caribbean, and Western
European and other States.

Because of their powerful stature globally, some of the largest, most powerful
countries have never held the presidency, including the five permanent members
of the United Nations Security Council and Japan.

A few countries had a national elected as president of UNGA twice: Argentina,
Chile, Ecuador, Hungary and Nigeria; all the other member states had a
national holding this office once (not counting additional special and
emergency special sessions of UNGA and also not considering that the then
separate West Germany and East Germany held the presidency once each during
the Cold War). In addition to the president, a slate of 21 vice-presidents are
elected for each General Assembly session. The vice-presidents have the same
powers and duties as the president, and the president may designate one of
them to cover his absence from any meeting or part thereof.
