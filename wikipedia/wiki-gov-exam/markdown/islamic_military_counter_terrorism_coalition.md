Intergovernmental counterterrorist military alliance

The **Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition** (**IMCTC**) is an
intergovernmental counter-terrorist military alliance between 43 member states
in the Muslim world, united around the war against the Islamic State and other
counter-terrorist activities. Its creation was first announced by Saudi
Arabian defence minister Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud, on 15 December 2015. The
alliance was to have a joint operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

When the coalition was announced there were 34 members. Additional countries
joined and the number of members reached 42 when Kenya joined on 1 September
2022. On 6 January 2017, the Former Chief of Army Staff of Pakistan General
Raheel Sharif was named the IMCTC's first commander. Most of its participants
are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

## History and objectives

IMCTC has stated that its primary objective is to protect Muslim countries
from all terrorist groups and terrorist organizations irrespective of their
sect and name. The IMCTC affirmed that it would operate in line with the
United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) provisions on
terrorism.

At the press conference to launch the IMCTC, Mohammad bin Salman said it would
"coordinate" efforts to fight terrorism in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Egypt and
Afghanistan. He said, "There will be international coordination with major
powers and international organisations ... in terms of operations in Syria and
Iraq."

The alliance does not include any countries with Shia-dominated governments,
such as Iran, Iraq and Syria. According to a Euronews report, some analysts
see formation of the alliance as part of Saudi Arabian efforts to take the
leading role in the Middle East and the Muslim world, in rivalry with Iran.
Due to the dominance of the alliance by states having majority Sunni Muslim
populations, it has been called "a sectarian coalition" by Hakeem Azameli, a
member of the Security and Defense Commission in the Iraqi parliament.

However, Oman, an Ibadi-dominant country has joined the alliance. Lebanon has
also supported the alliance. Other countries who are part of the alliance or
support it that have cordial or friendly relations with Iran include
Bangladesh, Kuwait, Libya, and Pakistan.[_citation needed_]

In March 2016, it was reported that Saudi Arabia had asked the then Pakistani
Chief of Army Staff Raheel Sharif, to become commander of the ICMTC once he
had retired from the Pakistan Army at the end of 2016.

## Members

Saudi Arabia's original announcement of the alliance on 15 December 2015
listed 34 countries as participants, each also a member of the Organisation of
Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and forming about 60% of all OIC member states. As
of May 2025, there are 43 member countries with the joining of Cameroon on 1
May 2025.

### Prospective additional members

At the time of the original announcement, more than ten other Islamic
countries, including Indonesia (the world's largest Muslim populated nation),
had expressed their support for the alliance, and Azerbaijan was discussing
joining the alliance. In 2018, however, former deputy defense minister Sjafrie
Sjamsoeddin remarked that Indonesia's non-alignment barred the country from
joining a military alliance, adding that Vice President Jusuf Kalla had
disagreed with Indonesia's accession.

By January 2017, Azerbaijan said that joining was "not on the agenda".
Tajikistan's ambassador to Saudi Arabia confirmed that Tajikistan was
seriously studying the possibility of joining.

On August 16, 2023, IMCTC's Secretary General, Maj. Gen. Al-Maghedi, pointed
that the IMCTC looked forward for the United Republic of Tanzania to join
IMCTC and work hand in hand with the rest of IMCTC member states in countering
terrorism and violent extremism.

## Reactions

State

  * Bangladesh: Bangladesh was one of the early members to join the alliance doing so on 15 December 2015. The country confirmed its membership in a joint statement by the founder nations that stated "a duty to protect the Islamic nation from the evils of all terrorist groups and organizations whatever their sect and name which wreak death and corruption on earth and aim to terrorize the innocent." However Bangladesh ruled out any military support.
  * China: China has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the alliance to fighting terrorism and appreciated Saudi efforts to create alliance.
  * Egypt: Egypt's Al-Azhar University called the alliance's formation "historic."
  * Germany: Germany's defense minister Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the alliance against terrorism but also stressed that it should be a part of the Vienna process involving all countries fighting against IS like the U.S., Europe, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, but also including Iran and China.
  * Malaysia: Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein expressed support for the alliance, but ruled out any military support from Malaysia.
  * Pakistan: After initial ambiguity Pakistan welcomed the initiative; its government confirmed its participation and stated that the country is waiting for further details in order to decide the extent of its participation in the different activities of the alliance.
  * Turkey: Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu called it the "best response to those who are trying to associate terror and Islam".
  * United States: The new alliance has been welcomed by the United States, with then U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter saying, "We look forward to learning more about what Saudi Arabia has in mind in terms of this coalition. But in general it appears it is very much in line with something we've been urging for quite some time, which is greater involvement in the campaign to combat ISIL by Sunni Arab countries.

Other

  * Army of the Men of the Naqshbandi Order: Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri the leader of the Naqshbandi Army released a statement in 2016 praising the alliance and calling on what he called Mujahideen to fight Shia militias in Iraq backed by Iran, while also saying "We consider everything that is happening in Iraq from Iran, its agents, militias, and its security apparatus, is the responsibility of the United States". He added: "If it [U.S.] did not move to save Iraq and its people from Iran's hegemony, control and occupation, and to stop bloodshed, destruction, burning and the changing demographic, then Iraqi people should resist [the occupation]."
