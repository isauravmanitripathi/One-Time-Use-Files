Continental union of African states

The **African Union** (**AU**) is a continental union of 55 member states
located on the continent of Africa. The AU was announced in the Sirte
Declaration in Sirte, Libya, on 9 September 1999, calling for the
establishment of the African Union. The bloc was launched on 9 July 2002 in
Durban, South Africa. The intention of the AU was to replace the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU), established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa by 32
signatory governments; the OAU was disbanded on 9 July 2002. The most
important decisions of the AU are made by the Assembly of the African Union, a
semi-annual meeting of the heads of state and government of its member states.

The AU's secretariat, the African Union Commission, is based in Addis Ababa.
The largest city in the AU is Lagos, Nigeria, while the largest urban
agglomeration is Cairo, Egypt. The African Union has more than 1.3 billion
people and an area of around 30 million km2 (12 million sq mi) and includes
world landmarks such as the Sahara and the Nile. The primary working languages
are Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swahili. Within the
African Union, there are official bodies, such as the Peace and Security
Council and the Pan-African Parliament.

At a G20 (Group of 20) meeting held in New Delhi, India, in 2023, the African
Union was admitted as a member to the G20.

## Overview

The objectives of the African Union are:

  1. To achieve greater unity, cohesion and solidarity among the African countries and African nations.
  2. To defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of its Member States.
  3. To accelerate the political and social-economic integration of the continent.
  4. To promote and defend African common positions on issues of interest to the continent and its peoples.
  5. To encourage international cooperation, taking due account of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
  6. To promote peace, security, and stability on the continent.
  7. To promote democratic principles and institutions, popular participation and good governance.
  8. To promote and protect human and peoples' rights in accordance with the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights and other relevant human rights instruments.
  9. To establish the necessary conditions which enable the continent to play its rightful role in the global economy and in international negotiations.
  10. To promote sustainable development at the economic, social and cultural levels as well as the integration of African economies.
  11. To promote co-operation in all fields of human activity to raise the living standards of African people.
  12. To coordinate and harmonise the policies between the existing and future Regional Economic Communities for the gradual attainment of the objectives of the Union.
  13. To advance the development of the continent by promoting research in all fields, in particular in science and technology.
  14. To work with relevant international partners in the eradication of preventable diseases and the promotion of good health on the continent.

The African Union is made up of both political and administrative bodies. The
highest decision-making organ is the Assembly of the African Union, made up of
all the heads of state or government of member states of the AU. The Assembly
is chaired by Félix Tshisekedi, President of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo. The AU also has a representative body, the Pan-African Parliament,
which consists of 265 members elected by the national legislatures of the AU
member states. Its president is Roger Nkodo Dang.

Other political institutions of the AU include:

  * the Executive Council, made up of foreign ministers, which prepares decisions for the Assembly;
  * the Permanent Representatives Committee, made up of the ambassadors to Addis Ababa of AU member states; and
  * the Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOCC), a civil society consultative body.

The AU Commission, the secretariat to the political structures, is chaired by
Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma of South Africa. On 15 July 2012, Dlamini-Zuma won a
tightly contested vote to become the first female head of the African Union
Commission, replacing Jean Ping of Gabon.

Other AU structures are hosted by different member states:

  * the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights is based in Banjul, the Gambia; and
  * the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and APRM Secretariats and the Pan-African Parliament are in Midrand, South Africa.

The AU's first military intervention in a member state was the May 2003
deployment of a peacekeeping force of soldiers from South Africa, Ethiopia,
and Mozambique to oversee the implementation of the various agreements in
Burundi. AU troops were also deployed in Sudan for peacekeeping during the
Darfur Conflict, before the mission was handed over to the United Nations on 1
January 2008 via UNAMID. The AU has a peacekeeping mission in Somalia,
consisting of troops from Uganda and Burundi.

The AU has adopted a number of important new documents establishing norms at
the continental level, to supplement those already in force when it was
created. These include the African Union Convention on Preventing and
Combating Corruption (2003), the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and
Governance (2007), the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and
its associated Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate
Governance.

## History

African leaders who founded the OAU the predecessor of the African Union,
Emperor Haile Selassie I (center), President Kenyatta (right) and other
African leaders including President Obote (behind, left side)

The historical foundations of the African Union originated in the **First
Congress of Independent African States** , held in Accra, Ghana from 15 to 22
April 1958. The conference was aimed at establishing Africa Day to annually
mark the liberation movement concerning the willingness of the African people
to free themselves from colonial rule, as well as subsequent attempts to unite
Africa, including the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which was
established on 25 May 1963, and the African Economic Community in 1991.
Critics argued that the OAU in particular did little to protect the rights and
liberties of African citizens from their own political leaders, often dubbing
it the "Dictators' Club".

The idea of creating the AU was revived in the mid-1990s under the leadership
of Libyan head of state Muammar al-Gaddafi; the heads of state and governments
of the OAU issued the Sirte Declaration (named after Sirte, Libya) on 9
September 1999, calling for the establishment of an African Union. The
Declaration was followed by summits at Lomé in 2000, when the Constitutive Act
of the African Union was adopted, and at Lusaka in 2001, when the plan for the
implementation of the African Union was adopted. During the same period, the
initiative for the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's
Development (NEPAD) was also established.

The African Union was launched in Durban on 9 July 2002 by its first
chairperson, former South African head of state Thabo Mbeki, at the first
session of the Assembly of the African Union. The second session of the
Assembly was held in Maputo in 2003 and the third session in Addis Ababa was
held on 6 July 2004.

Since 2010, the African Union eyes the establishment of a joint African space
agency.

Barack Obama was the first-ever sitting United States president to speak in
front of the African Union in Addis Ababa on 29 July 2015. During his speech,
he encouraged the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade
with the continent and lauded the signs of progress made in education,
infrastructure and economy. However, he also criticized a lack of democracy
and leaders who refuse to step down, discrimination against minorities
(including LGBT people, religious groups and ethnicities) and corruption. He
suggested an intensified democratization and free trade to significantly
increase living quality for Africans.

The African Union has a number of official bodies:

Pan-African Parliament (PAP)

    To become the highest legislative body of the African Union. The seat of the PAP is at Midrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. The Parliament is composed of 265 elected representatives from all 55 AU states, and intended to provide popular and civil-society participation in the processes of democratic governance. Its president is Roger Nkodo Dang, of Cameroon.
Assembly of the African Union

    Composed of heads of state and heads of government of AU states, the Assembly is currently the supreme governing body of the African Union. It is gradually devolving some of its decision-making powers to the Pan-African Parliament. It meets once a year and makes its decisions by consensus or by a two-thirds majority. The current chair of the AU is President Macky Sall, President of Senegal.
African Union Commission (or Authority)

    The secretariat of the African Union, composed of ten commissioners and supporting staff and headquartered in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. In a similar fashion to its European counterpart, the European Commission, it is responsible for the administration and coordination of the AU's activities and meetings.
Court of Justice of the African Union

    The Constitutive Act provides for a Court of Justice to rule on disputes over interpretation of AU treaties. A protocol to set up this Court of Justice was adopted in 2003 and entered into force in 2009. It was, however, superseded by a protocol creating an African Court of Justice and Human Rights, which will incorporate the already established African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights (see below) and have two chambers: one for general legal matters and one for rulings on the human rights treaties.
Executive Council

    Composed of ministers designated by the governments of member states. It decides on matters such as foreign trade, social security, food, agriculture and communications, is accountable to the Assembly, and prepares material for the Assembly to discuss and approve. It is chaired by Shawn Makuyana of Zimbabwe (2015– ).
Permanent Representatives' Committee

    Consisting of nominated permanent representatives of member states, the Committee prepares the work for the Executive Council, similar to the role of the Committee of Permanent Representatives in the European Union.
Peace and Security Council (PSC)

    Proposed at the Lusaka Summit in 2001 and established in 2004 under a protocol to the Constitutive Act adopted by the AU Assembly in July 2002. The protocol defines the PSC as a collective security and early-warning arrangement to facilitate timely and effective response to conflict and crisis situations in Africa. Other responsibilities conferred to the PSC by the protocol include prevention, management and resolution of conflicts, post-conflict peace building and developing common defence policies. The PSC has fifteen members elected on a regional basis by the Assembly. Similar in intent and operation to the United Nations Security Council.
Economic, Social and Cultural Council

    An advisory organ composed of professional and civic representatives, similar to the European Economic and Social Committee. The chair of ECOSOCC, elected in 2008, is Cameroonian lawyer Akere Muna of the Pan-African Lawyers Union (PALU).
Specialised Technical Committees

    Both the Abuja Treaty and the Constitutive Act provide for Specialised Technical Committees to be established made up of African ministers to advise the Assembly. In practice, they have never been set up. The ten proposed themes are: Rural Economy and Agricultural Matters; Monetary and Financial Affairs; Trade, Customs, and Immigration; Industry, Science and Technology; Energy, Natural Resources, and Environment; Transport, Communications, and Tourism; Health; Labour, and Social Affairs; Education, Culture, and Human Resources.
Financial institutions

  * African Central Bank – Abuja, Nigeria
  * African Investment Bank – Tripoli, Libya
  * African Monetary Fund – Yaoundé, Cameroon

These institutions have not yet been established; however, the Steering
Committees working on their founding have been constituted. Eventually, the AU
aims to have a single currency (the Afro).

Health

    The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), founded in 2016 and launched in 2017. Its Headquarters are in Addis Ababa Ethiopia.
Human rights

    The African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, in existence since 1986, is established under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (the African Charter) rather than the Constitutive Act of the African Union. It is the premier African human rights body, with responsibility for monitoring and promoting compliance with the African Charter. The African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights was established in 2006 to supplement the work of the commission, following the entry into force of a protocol to the African Charter providing for its creation. It is planned that the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights will be merged with the Court of Justice of the African Union (see above).
Space

    The African Space Agency was officially formed in 2023. It is headquartered in Cairo.
Energy

    The African Energy Commission was founded in 2008, and is based in Algiers.

### Member states

All UN member states based in Africa and on African islands are members of the
AU, as is the partially recognized state of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic
Republic (SADR). Morocco withdrew from the Organisation of African Unity in
1984 due to the admission as a member state of the SADR, whose territory of
Western Sahara it claims sovereignty over. It was readmitted by the AU as a
member state on 30 January 2017. Somaliland, which is claimed by Somalia,
applied to join the AU in 2005.

Mali was suspended from the African Union on 19 August 2020 following a
military coup. On 9 October of the same year, the Peace and Security Council
of the African Union lifted the suspension imposed on Mali, citing progress
made to return to democracy. The country was again suspended on 1 June 2021,
following its second military coup within nine months.

Guinea's membership was also suspended by the African Union on 10 September
2021, after a military coup deposed the country's President Alpha Condé.

Sudan's membership was suspended by the African Union on 27 October 2021,
after a military coup deposed the civilian government led by Prime Minister
Abdalla Hamdok.

Burkina Faso's membership was suspended by the African Union in the aftermath
of a military coup on 31 January 2022.

Niger's membership was suspended by the African Union on 22 August 2023
following a military coup in late July that deposed democratically elected
president Mohamed Bazoum; this has since also led to the 2023 Nigerien crisis.

Gabon's membership was suspended by the African Union on 31 August 2023
following a military coup that deposed president Ali Bongo Ondimba. In April
2025, the Peace and Security Council of the African Union rejoined the African
Union and decided to lift sanctions against Gabon.

### Governance

The principal topic for debate at the July 2007 AU summit held in Accra,
Ghana, was the creation of a Union Government, with the aim of moving towards
a United States of Africa. A study on the Union Government was adopted in late
2006, and proposes various options for "completing" the African Union project.
There are divisions among African states on the proposals, with some (notably
Libya) following a maximalist view leading to a common government with an AU
army; and others (especially the southern African states) supporting rather a
strengthening of the existing structures, with some reforms to deal with
administrative and political challenges in making the AU Commission and other
bodies truly effective.

Following a heated debate in Accra, the Assembly of Heads of State and
Government agreed in the form of a declaration to review the state of affairs
of the AU with a view to determining its readiness towards a Union Government.
In particular, the Assembly agreed to:

  * Accelerate the economic and political integration of the African continent, including the formation of a Union Government of Africa;
  * Conduct an audit of the institutions and organs of the AU; review the relationship between the AU and the RECs; find ways to strengthen the AU and elaborate a timeframe to establish a Union Government of Africa.

The declaration lastly noted the "importance of involving the African peoples,
including Africans in the Diaspora, in the processes leading to the formation
of the Union Government".

Following this decision, a panel of eminent persons was set up to conduct the
"audit review". The review team began its work on 1 September 2007. The review
was presented to the Assembly of Heads of State and Government at the January
2008 summit in Addis Ababa. No final decision was taken on the
recommendations, however, and a committee of ten heads of state was appointed
to consider the review and report back to the July 2008 summit to be held in
Egypt. At the July 2008 summit, a decision was once again deferred, for a
"final" debate at the January 2009 summit to be held in Addis Ababa.

#### Role of African Union

One of the key debates in relation to the achievement of greater continental
integration is the relative priority that should be given to integration of
the continent as a unit in itself or to integration of the sub-regions. The
1980 Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa and the 1991 treaty to
establish the African Economic Community (also referred to as the Abuja
Treaty), proposed the creation of Regional Economic Communities (RECs) as the
basis for African integration, with a timetable for regional and then
continental integration to follow.

Currently, there are eight RECs recognised by the AU, each established under a
separate regional treaty. They are:

  * the Arab Maghreb Union (AMU)
  * the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA)
  * the Community of Sahel-Saharan States (CEN-SAD)
  * the East African Community (EAC)
  * the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS)
  * the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
  * the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)
  * the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)

The membership of many of the communities overlaps, and their rationalisation
has been under discussion for several years—and formed the theme of the 2006
Banjul summit. At the July 2007 Accra summit the Assembly finally decided to
adopt a Protocol on Relations between the African Union and the Regional
Economic Communities. This protocol is intended to facilitate the
harmonisation of policies and ensure compliance with the Abuja Treaty and
Lagos Plan of Action time frames.

### Selection of the chairperson

In 2006, the AU decided to create a Committee "to consider the implementation
of a rotation system between the regions" in relation to the presidency.
Controversy arose at the 2006 summit when Sudan announced its candidacy for
the AU's chairmanship, as a representative of the East African region. Several
member states refused to support Sudan because of tensions over Darfur (see
also below). Sudan ultimately withdrew its candidacy and President Denis
Sassou-Nguesso of the Republic of the Congo was elected to a one-year term. At
the January 2007 summit, Sassou-Nguesso was replaced by President John Agyekum
Kufuor of Ghana, despite another attempt by Sudan to gain the chair. The year
2007 was the 50th anniversary of Ghana's independence, a symbolic moment for
the country to hold the chair of the AU—and to host the mid-year summit at
which the proposed Union Government was also discussed. In January 2008,
President Jakaya Kikwete of Tanzania took over as chair, representing the East
African region and thus apparently ending Sudan's attempt to become chair—at
least till the rotation returned to East Africa. The current chair is Mohamed
Ould Ghazouani, President of Mauritania, whose term began on February 17,
2024.

### Headquarters

The main administrative capital of the African Union is in Addis Ababa,
Ethiopia, where the African Union Commission is headquartered. A new
headquarters complex, the AU Conference Center and Office Complex (AUCC), was
inaugurated on 28 January 2012, during the 18th AU summit. The complex was
built by China State Construction Engineering Corporation as a gift from the
Chinese government, and accommodates, among other facilities, a 2,500-seat
plenary hall and a 20-story office tower. The tower is 99.9 meters high to
signify the date 9 September 1999, when the Organisation of African Unity
voted to become the African Union. The building cost US$200 million to
construct.

#### Espionage accusations

On 26 January 2018, five years after the completion of the building of the AU
Headquarters, the French newspaper _Le Monde_ published an article stating
that the Chinese government had heavily bugged the building, installing
listening devices in the walls and furniture and setting up the computer
system to copy data to servers in Shanghai daily. The Chinese government
denied that they bugged the building, stating that the accusations were
"utterly groundless and ridiculous". Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam
Desalegn rejected the French media report. Moussa Faki Mahamat, head of the
African Union Commission, said the allegations in the _Le Monde_ 's report
were false. "These are totally false allegations and I believe that we are
completely disregarding them." The African Union replaced its Chinese-supplied
servers and started encrypting its communications following the event.

### Foreign relations

The individual member states of the African Union coordinate foreign policy
through this agency, in addition to conducting their own international
relations on a state-by-state basis. The AU represents the interests of
African peoples at large in intergovernmental organisations (IGOs); for
instance, it is a permanent observer at the United Nations General Assembly.
Both the African Union and the United Nations work in tandem to address issues
of common concerns in various areas. The African Union Mission to the United
Nations aspires to serve as a bridge between the two organisations.

Membership of the AU overlaps with other IGOs, and occasionally, these third-
party organisations and the AU will coordinate on matters of public policy.
The African Union maintains special diplomatic representation with the United
States and the European Union.

#### Africa–Caribbean relations

Many Caribbean nations have sought to deepen ties with the continent of
Africa. The African Union has referred to the Caribbean as the potential
"Sixth Region" of the bloc. Some Caribbean nations moved to join African
institutions, including Barbados, the Bahamas and Guyana, which all became
members of the African Export–Import Bank. Also, the Caribbean Development
Bank signed a cooperation strategic partnership agreement with the African
Development Bank (AfDB). Antigua and Barbuda has also shown interest in a
direct transport link between Africa and the Caribbean. However, it has
resulted in some challenges regarding migration.

#### Africa–China relations

One of the leading economic partners of the continent has been the People's
Republic of China (PRC). The Forum on China–Africa Cooperation is the main
multi-lateral coordination mechanism between the African countries and China.
Since joining FOCAC in 2012, the African Union has increasingly played a
coordinating role, although each African country in FOCAC continues to
represent itself individually.

#### Africa–EU relations

For the European Commission, the European Union's relationship with Africa is
a key priority. The future Africa-EU partnership vision of the European
Commission and the European External Action Service is outlined in the Joint
Communication "Towards a Comprehensive Strategy with Africa". It proposes
partnering on:

  * Green Transition and Energy Access
  * Digital Transformation
  * Sustainable Growth and Jobs
  * Peace, Security and Governance
  * Migration and Mobility

On 2 December 2020, five Africa-Europe Foundation Strategy Groups were
established in the areas of Health, Digital, Agriculture and Sustainable Food
Systems, Sustainable energy and Transport and Connectivity. It was done
together with a consortium comprising Friends of Europe, Mo Ibrahim Foundation
and IPEMED.

In regards to strengthening resilience, peace, security and governance, the
African Union and the European Union recognize that resilience, peace,
security and governance are all closely linked. Peace and security are
important elements for sustainable development, prosperity and resilience of
societies. For ensuring peace and security, it had worked out the African
Peace Facility. This has been itself replaced in 2021 by the European Peace
Facility. The AU and EU are also partnering on promoting sustainable resources
management, environmental resilience, and climate change mitigation The Africa
Adaptation Initiative is also being supported by the European Union.

#### Africa–India relations

Inaugural India–Africa Forum Summit held in New Delhi, 2008

The India–Africa Forum Summit (IAFS) is the official platform for the African-
Indian relations. IAFS is held once in every three years. It was first held
from April 4 to April 8, 2008 in New Delhi, India. In 2015, the Third India-
Africa Forum Summit was held in New Delhi and summit was attended by 51 heads
of states of the African Union. In 2023, the African Union was admitted to G20
under the presidency of India, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New
Delhi.

#### Africa–Palestine relations

The African Union periodically invites the President of the State of Palestine
to make an opening speech during its annual Summit in Addis Ababa. According
to Article 10 of the Rules of Procedure of the Union, during the opening of
the meeting sessions, the President of the State of Palestine in person is
entitled to make an opening speech. After the Hamas attack on Israel in
October 2023, African Union Commission Chairperson Moussa Faki expressed his
"utmost concern" at the situation and called for an immediate cessation of
hostilities; additionally, he recalled that denial of the fundamental rights
of the Palestinian people, particularly that of an independent and sovereign
State of Palestine, was the "main cause of the permanent Israeli-Palestinian
tension".

#### Africa–Russia relations

Russia hosted the first Africa-Russia heads-of-state summit on October 23–24,
2019, Representatives from all 54 African states, including 43 heads-of-state
or government, attended the summit.

The second Russia-Africa Summit was scheduled for October 2022 in Addis Ababa,
but was then rescheduled to 26–29 July 2023 in Saint Petersburg.

#### Africa–South Korea relations

The first summit was the South Korea–Africa Summit, Seoul in June 2024.

#### Africa–Turkey relations

Turkey–Africa relations have gained substantial momentum since the declaration
of Turkey as a strategic partner of the continent by the African Union in
January 2008. Since 2008, various major summits and meetings have been taking
place between Turkey and AU. The first summit was The Turkey–Africa
Cooperation summit, Istanbul in August 2008.

As of 2020, Turkey has embassies in 42 countries and commercial counselors in
26 countries on the Africa continent. Turkey's national flag carrier Turkish
Airlines also flies to 35 destinations on the continent.

#### Africa–United States relations

AUC Chairperson Moussa Faki, US President Joe Biden and African leaders at the
United States–Africa Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C., 15 December 2022

In 2017, Donald Trump, President of the United States, issued an executive
order to ban citizens from seven countries with suspected links to terrorism
from entering the United States. Three of these are African countries, and
members of the AU. During the 28th African Union Summit in Ethiopia, African
leaders criticised the ban as they expressed their growing concerns for the
future of the African economy under President Trump's leadership and
subsequent policies.

### Military

The African Union has the power to militarily intervene on behalf of its
member states as laid out in Article 4(h) of the Constitutive Act of the
African Union, "in respect of grave circumstances, namely: war crimes,
genocide and crimes against humanity".

#### Togo

In response to the death of Gnassingbé Eyadéma, President of Togo, on 5
February 2005, AU leaders described the appointment of his son, Faure
Gnassingbé, to the presidency to have been a military coup. Togo's
constitution calls for the speaker of parliament to succeed the president in
the event of his death. By law, the parliament speaker must call national
elections to choose a new president within sixty days. The AU's protest forced
Gnassingbé to hold elections. Under heavy allegations of election fraud, he
was officially elected president on 4 May 2005.

#### Mauritania

On 3 August 2005, a coup in Mauritania led the African Union to suspend the
country from all organisational activities. The Military Council that took
control of Mauritania promised to hold elections within two years.[_citation
needed_] These were held in early 2007, the first time that the country had
held elections that were generally agreed to be of an acceptable standard.
Following the elections, Mauritania's membership of the AU was restored.
However, on 6 August 2008, a fresh coup overthrew the government elected in
2007. The AU once again suspended Mauritania from the continental body. The
suspension was once again lifted in 2009 after the military junta agreed with
the opposition to organise elections.

#### Mali

Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (formerly GSPC) area of operations

In March 2012, a military coup was staged in Mali, when an alliance of Touareg
and Islamist forces conquered the north, resulting in a coming to power of the
Islamists. This resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Malian soldiers and the
loss of control over their camps and positions. After a military intervention
with help from French troops, the region was in control of the Malian army. To
reinstall local authorities, the AU helped to form a caretaker government,
supporting it and holding presidential elections in Mali in July 2013.

In 2013, a summit for the African Union was held and it was decided that the
African Union was going to enlarge their military presence in Mali. The AU
decided to do this because of increasing tensions between al-Qaeda forces and
the Mali army. There have been several rebel groups that are vying for control
of parts of Mali. These rebel groups include the National Movement for the
Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), the National Front for the Liberation of Azawad
(FLNA), Ganda Koy, Ganda Izo, Ansar ad-Din, and Al-Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb (AQIM). AU forces have been tasked with counterinsurgency missions in
Mali as well as governing presidential elections to ensure as smooth a
transition of power as possible.

#### 2021 hotspots

A disputed election in December 2020 has led to intensification of the Central
African Republic Civil War, displacing 200,000 people. United Nations
peacekeepers, including soldiers from Russia and Rwanda, have kept the rebels
out of Bangui, but rebels control much of the rest of the country. The AU has
not sent peacekeepers to the areas because of a lack of agreement on how to
handle the situation: Chad and the Republic of the Congo support the rebels
while Rwanda and Angola support the government.

The Tigray War in Ethiopia has left millions in need of humanitarian aid.
Eritrean troops are said to be supporting the Ethiopian government, and there
have been border conflicts with Sudan. The relationship between Sudan and
Ethiopia is further complicated by the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam
project, which also directly affects Egypt.

##### Coup Belt

Map of successful coups in Africa since 2020

The term Coup Belt originated from coups that were staged beginning in the
early 2020s, including in Mali in 2020 and 2021, Guinea, Chad, and Sudan in
2021, two in Burkina Faso in January and September in 2022, and Niger and
Gabon in 2023. The region also saw attempted coups in Niger and Sudan in 2021,
Guinea–Bissau and The Gambia in 2022, and Sudan and Sierra Leone in 2023.
After the 2023 Nigerien coup, these countries formed a continuous chain
stretching between the east and west coasts of Africa.

### Regional conflicts and peacekeeping

One of the objectives of the AU is to "promote peace, security, and stability
on the continent". Among its principles is "Peaceful resolution of conflicts
among Member States of the Union through such appropriate means as may be
decided upon by the Assembly". The primary body charged with implementing
these objectives and principles is the Peace and Security Council. The PSC has
the power, among other things, to authorise peace support missions, to impose
sanctions in case of unconstitutional change of government, and to "take
initiatives and action it deems appropriate" in response to potential or
actual conflicts. The PSC is a decision-making body in its own right, and its
decisions are binding on member states.

Article 4(h) of the Constitutive Act, repeated in Article 4 of the Protocol to
the Constitutive Act on the PSC, also recognises the right of the Union to
intervene in a member state in circumstances of war crimes, genocide and
crimes against humanity. Any decision to intervene in a member state under
Article 4 of the Constitutive Act will be made by the Assembly on the
recommendation of the PSC.

Since it first met in 2004, the PSC has been active in relation to the crises
in Darfur, Comoros, Somalia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi, Ivory
Coast and other countries. It has adopted resolutions creating the AU
peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Darfur, and imposing sanctions against
persons undermining peace and security (such as travel bans and asset freezes
against the leaders of the rebellion in Comoros). The council is in the
process of overseeing the establishment of a "standby force" to serve as a
permanent African peacekeeping force.[_citation needed_]

The founding treaty of the AU also called for the establishment of the African
Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), including the African Standby Force
(ASF), which is to be deployed in emergencies. That means, in cases of
genocide or other serious human-rights violations, an ASF mission can be
launched even against the wishes of the government of the country concerned,
as long as it is approved by the AU. In past AU peacekeeping missions, the
concept was not yet applied and forces had to be mobilised from member states.
Although the ASF was declared fully operational in 2016 and used from 2017
onwards in ECOWAS, ECCAS and SADC interventions to the Gambia, Lesotho,
Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it has not been deployed
in the same way as originally concieved. Instead of the PSC acting as the
primary initiator of ASF action as previously planned, Regional Economic
Communities have took charge of mobilizing ASF capabilities. In light of
continued criticism, ASF reform remains a prominent topic of discussion at the
AU.

#### Darfur, Sudan

South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011

In response to the ongoing Darfur conflict in Sudan, the AU has deployed 7,000
peacekeepers, many from Rwanda and Nigeria, to Darfur. While a donor's
conference in Addis Ababa in 2005 helped raise funds to sustain the
peacekeepers through that year and into 2006, in July 2006 the AU said it
would pull out at the end of September when its mandate expires. Critics of
the AU peacekeepers, including Eric Reeves, have said these forces are largely
ineffective due to lack of funds, personnel, and expertise. Monitoring a large
area has made it even more difficult to sustain an effective mission. In June
2006, the United States Congress appropriated US$173 million for the AU force.
Some, such as the Genocide Intervention Network, have called for UN or NATO
intervention to augment and/or replace the AU peacekeepers. The UN has
considered deploying a force, though it would not likely enter the country
until at least October 2007. The under-funded and badly equipped AU mission
was set to expire on 31 December 2006 but was extended to 30 June 2007 and
merged with the United Nations African Union Mission in Darfur in October
2007. In July 2009 the African Union ceased cooperation with the International
Criminal Court, refusing to recognise the international arrest warrant it had
issued against Sudan's leader, Omar al-Bashir, who was indicted in 2008 for
war crimes.

The AU struggled to have a strategic role in the independence talks and the
reconciliation process of South Sudan, due to overwhelming interests of
African and non-African powers, its influence is still limited and not
consistent.

#### Somalia

Kenyan soldiers and fighters of the Ras Kamboni Brigades, a Somali government-
allied militia, near Kismayo, Somalia, 2012

From the early 1990s up until 2000, Somalia was without a functioning central
government. A peace agreement aimed at ending the civil war that broke out
following the collapse of the Siad Barre regime was signed in 2006 after many
years of peace talks. However, the new government was almost immediately
threatened by further violence. In February 2007, the African Union (AU) and
European Union (EU) worked together to establish the African Union Mission in
Somalia (AMISOM). The purpose of AMISOM was to create a foundation that would
hopefully provide aid to some of Somalia's most vulnerable and keep the peace
in the region. They are tasked with everything from protecting federal
institutions to facilitating humanitarian relief operations. Much of the AU's
opposition comes from an Islamic extremist group named al-Shabaab. To
temporarily shore up the government's military base, starting in March 2007,
AU soldiers began arriving in Mogadishu as part of a peacekeeping force that
was intended by the AU to eventually be 8,000 strong. Eritrea recalled its
ambassadors to the African Union on 20 November 2009 after the African Union
called on the United Nations Security Council to impose sanctions on them due
to their alleged support of Somali Islamists attempting to topple the
Transitional Federal Government of Somalia, the internationally recognised
government of Somalia which holds Somalia's seat on the African Union. On 22
December 2009, the United Nations Security Council passed UNSCR 1907, which
imposed an arms embargo on Eritrea, travel bans on Eritrean leaders, and asset
freezes on Eritrean officials. Eritrea strongly criticised the resolution. In
January 2011, Eritrea reestablished their mission to the AU in Addis Ababa.

In the fall of 2011, AMISOM forces, along with Kenyan and Ethiopian forces,
launched a set of offensive attacks on the al-Shabaab. In these attacks,
AMISOM forces were able to reclaim key cities including the Somali capital of
Mogadishu. In September 2013, political scientist Ethan Bueno de Mesquita
argued that with the help of AMISOM forces, they had made it "nearly
impossible for al-Shabaab to hold territory even in its former strongholds in
southern Somalia". Although much progress has been made towards peace in the
region, it should still be noted that African Union forces' still get attacked
regularly. Despite AMISOM being effective, it is vastly underfunded and many
forces lack the resources required. Funding for humanitarian relief and the
formation of armies tends to be vastly undercut.

#### Anjouan, Comoros

A successful 2008 invasion of Anjouan by AU and Comoros forces to stop self-
declared president Mohamed Bacar, whose 2007 re-election was declared illegal.
Prior to the invasion, France helped transport Tanzanian troops but their
position in the disagreement was questioned when a French police helicopter
was suspected of attempting to sneak Bacar into French exile. The first wave
of troops landed on Anjouan Bay on 25 March and soon took over the airfield in
Ouani, ultimately aiming to locate and remove Bacar from office. On the same
day, the airport, capital, and second city were overrun and the presidential
palace was deserted. Bacar escaped and sought asylum in France. The Comoros
government demanded his return, in order to determine his fate. Many of
Bacar's main supporters were arrested by the end of March, including Caabi El-
Yachroutu Mohamed and Ibrahim Halidi. Bacar's asylum request was rejected on
15 May, as France agreed to cooperate with the Comoran government's demand. At
the 29 June elections, Moussa Toybou won the presidency.

#### Chagos Islands dispute

The sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean is disputed
between the United Kingdom and Mauritius. In February 2019, the International
Court of Justice in The Hague issued an advisory opinion stating that the UK
must transfer the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius. On 22 May 2019, the United
Nations General Assembly debated and adopted a resolution that affirmed that
the Chagos archipelago "forms an integral part of the territory of Mauritius".
The African Union urged the United Kingdom to comply with a UN resolution
calling for it to withdraw from the Chagos Islands. The UK does not recognise
Mauritius' sovereignty claim over the Chagos Archipelago.

### Current issues

The AU faces many challenges, including health issues such as combating
malaria and the AIDS/HIV epidemic; political issues such as confronting
undemocratic regimes and mediating in the many civil wars; economic issues
such as improving the standard of living of millions of impoverished,
uneducated Africans; ecological issues such as dealing with recurring famines,
desertification, and lack of ecological sustainability; as well as the legal
issues regarding Western Sahara.

#### Corruption

Daniel Batidam, an anti-corruption advisory board member of the African Union,
resigned after stating that the organisation had "multiple irregularities" and
that "issues have come up over and over again" regarding corruption. The
African Union quickly accepted his resignation, with Batidam saying that it
was a sign that mismanagement towards corruption will "continue with business
as usual".

In a story published on 12 March 2020, AU staff alleged that Commission
chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat was guilty of corruption and cronyism, as well as
running of a "mafia-style cartel" that operates with impunity. The allegations
were contained in a memo leaked to the South African _Mail& Guardian_. This
followed sexual harassment allegations raised in late 2018.

#### Libyan crisis

In 2011, when the conflict in Libya began, the African Union was initially
criticised for doing little to prevent the conflict's escalation.
Additionally, the AU hesitated to take a side. It was unclear whether the AU
supported the Libyan regime or the rebels. This occurred as several human
right violations were perpetrated against members of the Libyan regime. It was
later realised that the AU's hesitation was due to its lack of capacity and
its inability to engage in democratic reform.

The AU attempted to mediate in the early stages of the 2011 Libyan civil war,
forming an _ad hoc_ committee of five presidents (Congolese President Denis
Sassou Nguesso, Malian President Amadou Toumani Touré, Mauritanian President
Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, South African President Jacob Zuma, and Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni) to broker a truce. However, the beginning of the
NATO-led military intervention in March 2011 prevented the committee from
traveling to Libya to meet with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. As a body, the
AU sharply dissented from the United Nations Security Council's decision to
create a no-fly zone over Libya, though a few member states, such as Botswana,
Gabon, Zambia, and others expressed support for the resolution.

As a result of Gaddafi's defeat at the Battle of Tripoli (the war's deciding
battle), in August 2011, the Arab League voted to recognise the anti-Gaddafi
National Transitional Council as the legitimate government of the country,
pending elections. The council has been recognised by several AU member
states, including two Arab League members. However, the AU Peace and Security
Council voted on 26 August 2011 not to recognise it, insisting on a ceasefire
and on the formation of a national unity government by both sides. A number of
AU member states led by Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Rwanda requested that the AU
recognise the NTC as Libya's interim governing authority, and several other AU
member states have recognised the NTC regardless of the Peace and Security
Council's decision. However, AU member states Algeria and Zimbabwe have
indicated they will not recognise the NTC, and South Africa has expressed
reservations as well.

On 20 September 2011, the African Union officially recognised the National
Transitional Council as the legitimate representative of Libya.

In post-Gaddafi Libya, the African Union believes it still has an important
responsibility to the country despite its failure to contribute to the
conflict when it originated. Although the African Union is there to keep
peace, it is not a long-term solution. The goal, as stated by the AU, is to
establish a Libyan government that is sustainable to ensuring peace in Libya.
To achieve some level of peace in Libya, the AU has to moderate peace talks
which are aimed at achieving compromises and power sharing accommodations as
well.

## Geography

Regions of the African Union:  
**Northern Region** (Sahara)  
**Southern Region** (Kalahari)  
**Eastern Region** (Nile)  
**Western Regions A and B** (Niger and Volta Niger)  
**Central Region** (Congo)

Member states of the African Union cover almost the entirety of continental
Africa, except for several territories held by Spain (Ceuta, Melilla, and
Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera). In addition, European countries have
dependencies among the offshore islands of Africa: Spain (the Canary Islands
and the islands of the plazas de soberanía); France (Mayotte, Réunion, and the
Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean); Portugal (the Azores, Madeira, and the
Savage Islands); and the United Kingdom (Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan
da Cunha). The geography of the African Union is wildly diverse, including the
world's largest hot desert (the Sahara), huge jungles and savannas, and the
world's longest river (the Nile).

The AU has an area of 29,922,059 square kilometres (11,552,972 sq mi), with
24,165 kilometres (15,015 mi) of coastline. The vast majority of this area is
on continental Africa, while the only significant territories off the mainland
are the island of Madagascar (the world's largest microcontinent and fourth-
largest island) and the Sinai Peninsula (geographically a part of Asia),
accounting for slightly less than 2% of the total area.

## Economy

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) was created among 54 of the
55 AU nations, with trade commencing as of 1 January 2021. The African
Export–Import Bank, to support this initiative, created the Pan-African
Payment and Settlement System.

The AU's future goals include a customs union, a single market, a central
bank, and a common currency (see African Monetary Union), thereby establishing
economic and monetary union.

### Indicators

The following table shows various data for AU member states, including area,

## Demographics

### Population

The total population of the African Union, as of 2017[update], is estimated at
more than 1.25 billion, with a growth rate of more than 2.5% p.a.

### Migration

In 2018, the African Union adopted the Free Movement Protocol. This protocol
allows for free movement of people between countries that are part of the
African Union.

Article 14 of the Protocol to the treaty establishing the African economic
community relating to the free movement of persons, right of residence, and
the right of establishment discusses the free movement of workers.

The African Union also has a Migration Policy Framework for Africa (MPFA).

Forced displacement of people and groups has also been an area of focus for
the AU—over thirty states have ratified the Kampala Convention, the only
continental treaty focusing on internally displaced persons in the world.

Beginning in 2016, the African Union introduced continent-wide passports.

As of 2025 there has been an increased push for an implementation of the Free
Movement Protocol. The UN has urged more states to ratify the protocol, and
has praised Ghana for allowing visa free travel for all individuals with an
African passport.

### Languages

Map showing the traditional language families represented in Africa (1996)

The official languages of the African Union are Arabic, English, French,
Portuguese, Spanish, Swahili, and "any other African language". The primary
working languages of the African Union are English and French. To a lesser
extent Portuguese and Arabic are used. The Constitutive Act, for example, is
written in English, French and Arabic, while the protocol amending the
Constitutive Act is written in English, French and Portuguese. As of 2020, the
AU website is available in its entirety in English, partially in French and
minimally in Arabic. Portuguese and Swahili versions were added as "coming
soon" (_em breve_) in April 2019.

According to the Constitutive Act of the African Union,

> The working languages of the Union and all its institutions shall be, if
> possible, African languages, Arabic, English, French and Portuguese.

A protocol amending the Constitutive Act was adopted in 2003 and as of April
2020 has been ratified by 30 of the 37 member states needed for a two-thirds
majority. It would change the above wording to,

> 1\. The official languages of the Union and all its institutions shall be
> Arabic, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Kiswahili and any other
> African language.  
>  2\. The Executive Council shall determine the process and practical
> modalities for the use of official languages as working languages.

Founded in 2001 under the auspices of the AU, the African Academy of Languages
promotes the usage and perpetuation of African languages among African people.
In 2004 Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique addressed the assembly in Swahili, but
had to translate his words himself. The AU declared 2006 the Year of African
Languages. 2006 also marked Ghana's 55th anniversary since it founded the
Bureau of Ghana Languages originally known as Gold Coast Vernacular Literature
Bureau.

### Health

#### AIDS in Africa

Prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Africa, total (% of population ages 15–49), in 2011
(World Bank)  over 15% 5–15% 2–5% 1–2% 0.5–1% 0.1–0.5% not available  
---  
  
The AU has been active in addressing the AIDS pandemic in Africa. In 2001, the
AU established AIDS Watch Africa to coordinate and mobilise a continent-wide
response. Sub-Saharan Africa, especially southern and eastern Africa, is the
most affected area in the world. Though this region is home to only 6.2% of
the world's population, it is also home to half of the world's population
infected with HIV. While the measurement of HIV prevalence rates has proved
methodologically challenging, more than 20% of the sexually active population
of many countries of southern Africa may be infected, with South Africa,
Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, and Zimbabwe all expected to have a decrease in life
expectancy by an average of 6.5 years. The pandemic has had massive
implications for the economy of the continent, reducing economic growth rates
by 2–4% across Africa.

In July 2007, the AU endorsed two new initiatives to combat the AIDS crisis,
including a push to recruit, train and integrate two million community health
workers into the continent's healthcare systems.

In January 2012, the African Union Assembly requested that the African Union
Commission would work out "a roadmap of shared responsibility to draw on
African efforts for a viable health funding with support of traditional and
emerging partners to address AIDS dependency response". Once created, the
roadmap (as it is officially known) provided a group of solutions that would
enhance the shared responsibility and global solidarity for AIDS, TB, and
Malaria responses in Africa by 2015. The roadmap was organised into three
pillars: diversified financing, access to medicines, and enhanced health
governance. The roadmap held stakeholders accountable for the realisation of
these solutions between 2012 and 2015.

The first pillar, diversified financing, ensures that countries begin to
develop a country specific financial sustainability plans with clear targets,
and identify and maximise opportunities to diversify funding sources in order
to increase the domestic resource allocation to AIDS and other diseases.

The second pillar, access to affordable and quality-assured medicines, tries
to promote and facilitate investing in leading medicine hub manufacturers in
Africa, accelerate and strengthen medicine regulatory harmonisation, and
create legislation that would help to protect the knowledge of the researchers
who develop these life-saving medicines.

The third pillar, enhanced leadership and governance, tries to invest in
programs that support people and communities to prevent HIV and ensure that
leadership at all levels is mobilised to implement the roadmap. There are
several organisations that will ensure the smooth implementation of the
roadmap, including NEPAD, UNAIDS, WHO, and several other UN partners.

#### COVID-19 pandemic

By February 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa had resulted in 3.6 million
confirmed cases and 89,000 related deaths, and only 25% of African countries
had adequate plans for vaccination, according to the Africa Centres for
Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC). The pandemic has also devastated
economies around the world, including in Africa.

## Culture

### Symbols

Emblem of the African Union

The emblem of the African Union consists of a gold ribbon bearing small
interlocking red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold
circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of
Africa. The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood
shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for
Africa's wealth and bright future; the green, for African hopes and
aspirations. To symbolise African unity, the silhouette of Africa is drawn
without internal borders.

The African Union adopted its new flag at its 14th Ordinary Session of the
Assembly of Heads of State and Government taking place in Addis Ababa 2010.
During the 8th African Union Summit which took place in Addis Ababa on 29 and
30 January 2007, the Heads of State and Government decided to launch a
competition for the selection of a new flag for the Union. They prescribed a
green background for the flag symbolising hope of Africa and stars to
represent Member States.

Pursuant to this decision, the African Union Commission (AUC) organised a
competition for the selection of a new flag for the African Union. The AUC
received a total of 106 entries proposed by citizens of 19 African countries
and 2 from the Diaspora. The proposals were then examined by a panel of
experts put in place by the African Union Commission and selected from the
five African regions for short listing according to the main directions given
by the Heads of State and Government.

At the 13th Ordinary Session of the Assembly, the Heads of State and
Government examined the report of the Panel and selected one among all the
proposals. The flag is now part of the paraphernalia of the African Union and
replaces the old one.

The old flag of the African Union bears a broad green horizontal stripe, a
narrow band of gold, the emblem of the African Union at the centre of a broad
white stripe, another narrow gold band and a final broad green stripe. Again,
the green and gold symbolise Africa's hopes and aspirations as well as its
wealth and bright future, and the white represents the purity of Africa's
desire for friends throughout the world. The flag has led to the creation of
the "national colours" of Africa of gold and green (sometimes together with
white). These colours are visible in one way or another in the flags of many
