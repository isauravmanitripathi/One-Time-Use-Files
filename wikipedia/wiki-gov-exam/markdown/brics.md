Intergovernmental organization

**BRICS** is an intergovernmental organization comprising ten countries –
**B** razil, **R** ussia, **I** ndia, **C** hina, **S** outh Africa, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. The idea of a BRICS-
like group can be traced back to Russian foreign minister Yevgeny Primakov and
to the two forums RIC (Russia, India, China) and IBSA (India, Brazil, South
Africa). BRIC was originally a term coined by British economist Jim O'Neill
and later championed by his employer Goldman Sachs in 2001 to designate the
group of emerging markets. The first summit in 2009 featured the founding
countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, where they adopted the acronym
**BRIC** and formed an informal diplomatic club where their governments could
meet annually at formal summits and coordinate multilateral policies. In April
2010, South Africa attended the 2nd BRIC summit as a guest. In September 2010
they joined the organization which was then renamed BRICS, and attended the
3rd BRICS summit in 2011 as a full member. Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the
United Arab Emirates attended their first summit as member states in 2024 in
Russia. Indonesia officially joined as a member state in early 2025, becoming
the first Southeast Asian member. The acronym **BRICS+** (in its expanded form
**BRICS Plus**) has been informally used to reflect new membership since 2024.

Some in the West consider BRICS the alternative to the G7. Others describe the
grouping as an incoherent joining of countries around increasing anti-Western
and anti-American objectives. Together BRICS has implemented competing
initiatives such as the New Development Bank, the BRICS Contingent Reserve
Arrangement, BRICS PAY, the BRICS Joint Statistical Publication and the BRICS
basket reserve currency. In its first 15 years BRICS has established almost 60
intra-group institutions, and think tanks to dialogues, covering agenda in 34
subjects. The original five members and Indonesia are also part of the G20.
BRICS has received both praise and criticism from numerous commentators and
world leaders.

## History

### Founding

Collective action in the political arena in the late 1990s was present before
the economic rationale of BRICS. The idea of a multipolar group like BRICS can
be traced back to Yevgeny Primakov during his term as Minister of Foreign
Affairs of Russia. He reiterated the idea in New Delhi in 1998. The forums RIC
(Russia, India, China) and IBSA (India, Brazil, South Africa) predated and
played an important role in the creation of BRIC and subsequently BRICS.

The New Development Bank, headquartered in Shanghai, China, is the premier
institution of BRICS.

The term _BRIC_ , as compared to the alternate term _CRIB_ , was originally
developed in the context of foreign investment strategies. It was introduced
in the 2001 publication, _Building Better Global Economic BRICs_ by Jim
O'Neill, then head of global economics research at Goldman Sachs and later
Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. O'Neill now regards the BRICS
group as a failed project. In a 2021 article for _Project Syndicate_ he wrote
that the BRICS countries "have so far proven incapable of uniting as a
meaningful global force" and felt in 2024 that "each year also brings further
confirmation that the grouping serves no real purpose beyond generating
symbolic gestures and lofty rhetoric".

The foreign ministers of the initial four BRIC states (Brazil, Russia, India,
and China) met in New York City in September 2006 at the margins of the
General Debate of the UN Assembly, beginning a series of high-level meetings.
A full-scale diplomatic meeting was held in Yekaterinburg, Russia, on 16 June
2009.

The BRIC group's first formal summit, also held in Yekaterinburg, commenced on
16 June 2009, with Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Dmitry Medvedev, Manmohan Singh,
and Hu Jintao, the respective leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, and China, all
attending. The summit's focus was on improving the global economic situation
and reforming financial institutions amid the Great Recession. There was also
discussion of how the four countries could better cooperate in the future, and
ways developing countries, such as three-fourth of the BRIC members, could
become more involved in global affairs.

In the aftermath of the 2009 Yekaterinburg summit, the BRIC nations announced
the need for a new global reserve currency, which would have to be "diverse,
stable and predictable". Although their statement did not directly criticize
the perceived dominance of the US dollar (as Russia had in the past) it did
spark a fall in the value of the dollar against other major currencies.

### 2010 expansion

In 2010, South Africa began efforts to join BRIC, and the process for its
formal admission began in August of that year. South Africa officially became
a member nation on 24 December 2010 after being formally invited by China, and
was subsequently accepted by other BRIC countries. The group was renamed
_BRICS_ to represent the addition of _South Africa_ to the original four BRIC
members. At the third BRICS summit in 2011 in Sanya, China, South African
president Jacob Zuma represented the country as a full member for the first
time.

### New Development Bank

BRICS representatives during the 15th BRICS summit in Johannesburg, 23 August
2023

In June 2012, the BRICS nations pledged $75 billion to boost the lending power
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). However, the proposed loan was
conditional on IMF voting reforms. In March 2013, during the fifth BRICS
summit in Durban, the member countries agreed to create a global financial
institution to cooperate with the western-dominated IMF and World Bank. They
planned to set up this New Development Bank (known at the time as the "BRICS
Development Bank") by 2014.

At the BRICS leaders meeting in Saint Petersburg in September 2013, China
committed $41 billion towards the pool; Brazil, India, and Russia $18 billion
each; and South Africa $5 billion. China, which held the world's largest
foreign exchange reserves and contributed the bulk of the currency pool,
wanted a more significant managing role. China also wanted to be the location
of the reserve. In October 2013, Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said
that creating a $100 billion in funds designated to steady currency markets
would be taken in early 2014. The Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega,
confirmed that the fund would be created by March 2014. However, by April
2014, the currency reserve pool and development bank had yet to be set up, and
the date was rescheduled to 2015.

In July 2014, during the sixth BRICS summit in Fortaleza, the BRICS members
signed a document to create the US$100 billion New Development Bank and a
reserve currency pool worth over another US$100 billion. Documents on
cooperation between BRICS export credit agencies and an agreement of
cooperation on innovation were also signed.[_citation needed_] The Fortaleza
summit was followed by a BRICS meeting with the Union of South American
Nations presidents in Brasília.

### Other initiatives

2024 BRICS Games in Russia

Since 2011, the National Institutes of Statistics of the BRICS group of
countries (Institute of Geography and Statistics (Brazil), Federal State
Statistics Service (Russia), the National Bureau of Statistics (China), the
Central Statistics Office (India), and Statistics South Africa) produce an
annual joint statistical publication to put statistical production in
perspective, compare adopted methodologies and statistical results. The
publication serves as a single data platform for the mutual benefit of
participating countries.

Since 2012, the BRICS group of countries has been planning an optical fiber
submarine communications cable system to carry telecommunications between the
BRICS countries, known as the BRICS Cable. Part of the motivation for the
project was the spying of the U.S. National Security Agency on all
telecommunications that flowed in and out of United States territory.
Construction of the proposed cable network was abandoned in 2015, possibly due
to cost.

In August 2019, the communications ministers of the BRICS countries signed a
letter of intent to cooperate in the Information and Communication Technology
sector. This agreement was signed in the fifth edition of the meeting of
communication ministers of countries member of the group held in Brasília,
Brazil.

Meeting of BRICS foreign ministers on 22 September 2022

The New Development Bank plans on giving out $15 billion to member states to
help their struggling economies. Member countries are hoping for a smooth
comeback and a continuation of economic trade pre-COVID-19. The 2020 BRICS
summit was held virtually in St. Petersburg, Russia, and discussed how to
handle the COVID-19 pandemic and how to fix the multilateral system via
reforms. During the 13th BRICS summit, in 2021, Indian Prime Minister Narendra
Modi called for a transparent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 under
the World Health Organization with the full cooperation of "all countries",
and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke directly afterwards, calling on BRICS
countries to "oppose politicisation" of the process.

In May 2023, South Africa announced that it would be giving diplomatic
immunity to Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials so that they could
attend the 15th BRICS Summit despite the ICC arrest warrant for Putin. In July
2023, the Russian president announced that he would not personally attend the
BRICS summit in Johannesburg on 22–24 August despite good relations with the
South African government. Russian news channels noted that Putin would
remotely participate online in all BRICS leaders' sessions, including its
Business Forum, and also deliver his remarks virtually.

In the first 15 years of BRICS, it produced hundreds of decisions and complied
with a majority of them. BRICS has established almost 60 intra-group
institutions and a network including think tanks and dialogues in various
areas. The group has an agenda of over 30 subjects. These groups include:
BRICS Business Council, BRICS Think Tanks Council, BRICS Women's Business
Alliance, BRICS Business Forum, and the BRICS Academic Forum. At Kazan the
establishment of a BRICS Deep-Sea Resources International Research Center and
a BRICS Digital Ecosystem Cooperation Network was announced.

In 2021 BRICS formally agreed to work together to build a satellite
constellation and share remote sensing satellite data from this. The
constellation will have six existing satellites from China, Russia and India.
In 2023, Russia proposed that the other BRICS members could build a joint
research station on its space station.

### Discussions

BRICS has been involved in discussions related to areas of conflict and
humanitarian crises such as Afghanistan, Gaza, Lebanon, Sudan, Haiti, Syria
and Ukraine. NATO air strikes in Libya were discussed during the third summit.
In 2023 South African chair President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned the Gaza war.
In 2024, a joint statement slamming Israel's attacks in Gaza was made by the
foreign ministers of BRICS.

### 2024 expansion

Kazan hosted the first plenary session of the 16th BRICS Summit in the
Outreach/BRICS+ format

In August 2023, at the 15th BRICS summit, South African President Cyril
Ramaphosa announced that 6 emerging market group countries (Argentina, Egypt,
Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) had been invited
to join the bloc. Full membership was scheduled to take effect on 1 January
2024.

However, the Argentine general election in November 2023 led to a change in
president to Javier Milei, who had committed to withdraw the country's
membership application. On 30 November 2023, incoming Foreign Minister of
Argentina Diana Mondino confirmed that Argentina would not join the BRICS. On
29 December 2023 the Government of Argentina sent a letter to all BRICS
leaders to officially announce its withdrawal from the application process.

By January 2024, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates joined
the bloc making BRICS membership grow from five to nine countries, while Saudi
Arabia delayed its membership. Saudi Arabia did not join BRICS at the start of
2024 as had been planned, and it announced in mid-January that it was still
considering the matter. As of April 2024, the matter is still under
consideration. The organizers touted the expansion as part of a plan to build
a competing multipolar world order that uses Global South countries to
challenge and compete against the western-dominated world order. _China Daily_
used the expansion to claim that more developing countries were interested in
joining BRICS.

On 24 October 2024, an additional 13 countries, namely Algeria, Belarus,
Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey,
Uganda, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, were invited to participate as "partner
countries". The partner status would allow these countries to engage with and
benefit from BRICS initiatives. It is unclear whether the countries in this
tier have received official membership invitations.

### 2025 expansion

On 6 January 2025, Indonesia joined BRICS officially as a full member, making
it the first Southeast Asian state to join the bloc, as well as the 11th
member of BRICS. Jakarta's bid got the green light from the bloc in 2023, but
the Southeast Asian country asked to join following the presidential election
held in 2024. 2025's BRICS presidency leader and Brazil's Lula announced their
official entry. Indonesia's history with the original BRIC members goes back
to 2009, when some observers referred to a theorized grouping as "BRICI" given
Indonesia's growing and stable economy and ties to India and China.

The partnerships that were announced in the previous year, went into effect in
January 2025 as well. Nigeria joined the partnership countries on 17 January.

## Rotating BRICS presidency

Leaders' meetings (or leaders' summits) are held once a year on a rotating
basis. The group at each summit elects one of the heads of state of the
component countries to serve as President Pro Tempore of the BRICS.[_citation
needed_] A number of ministerial meetings are held during the year, for
example, between foreign ministers, finance ministers, central bank governors,
trade ministers and energy ministers. Technical level meetings focus on
project implementation and technical exchanges, such as the meeting of BRICS
heads of national statistics offices. There are working groups on technology,
culture, education, health etc. Specialized forums exist such as the BRICS
Business Forum, and the BRICS Think Tank Council. The BRICS has neither a
permanent seat or secretariat.

In 2019, the President Pro Tempore position was held by the president of
Brazil. The priorities of the Brazilian Pro Tempore Presidency for 2019 were
the following: strengthening the cooperation in science, technology, and
innovation, enhancement of the cooperation on digital economy, invigoration of
cooperation on the fight against transnational crime — especially organized
crime, money laundering, and drug trafficking, and rapprochement between the
New Development Bank (NDB) and the BRICS Business Council. In 2024 BRICS
President Pro Tempore was from Russia and their goals were: investing in BRICS
countries to strengthen their economies, cooperating in the energy and
environmental industries, helping with young children, and coming up with
resolutions on migration and peacekeeping. Brazil has the current Pro Tempore
Presidency in 2025.

## Leaders' Summits

The grouping has held annual summits since 2009, with member countries taking
turns to host. Before South Africa's admission, two BRIC summits were held, in
2009 and 2010. The first five-member BRICS summit was held in 2011 in China.
The first nine-member BRICS summit was held in 2024 in Russia. The 2020, 2021,
and 2022 summits were held via video-conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Financial architecture

The New Development Bank (NDB) is based in Shanghai. The New Development Bank
(NDB) and Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) were signed into treaty at the
2014 BRICS summit in Brazil.

The group is dominated by China, which has the largest share of the group's
GDP, accounting to about 70% of the organization total.

The financial architecture of BRICS is made of the New Development Bank (NDB)
and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA). These components were signed
into a treaty in 2014 and became active in 2015.

### New Development Bank

The New Development Bank (NDB), formally referred to as the BRICS Development
Bank, is a multilateral development bank operated by the five BRICS states.
The bank's primary focus of lending is infrastructure projects with authorized
lending of up to $34 billion annually. South Africa hosts the African
headquarters of the bank. The bank has a starting capital of $50 billion, with
wealth increased to $100 billion over time. Brazil, Russia, India, China, and
South Africa initially contributed $10 billion each to bring the total to $50
billion. As of 2020, it had 53 projects underway worth around $15 billion. By
2024 the bank had approved more than $32 billion for 96 projects.

In 2021, Bangladesh, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Uruguay joined the
NDB.

### BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement

The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) is a framework for protecting
against global liquidity pressures. This includes currency issues where
members' national currencies are being adversely affected by global financial
pressures. Emerging economies that experienced rapid economic liberalization
went through increased economic volatility, bringing an uncertain
macroeconomic environment. The CRA competes with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). Along with the New Development Bank, it is an example of
increasing South-South cooperation. It was established in 2015 by the BRICS
countries. The legal basis is formed by the _Treaty for the Establishment of a
BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement_ , signed in Fortaleza in July 2014. With
its inaugural meetings of the BRICS CRA Governing Council and Standing
Committee, held on 4 September 2015, in Ankara, Turkey. It entered into force
upon ratification by all BRICS states, announced at the 7th BRICS summit in
July 2015.

### BRICS payment system

At the 2015 BRICS summit in Russia, ministers from the BRICS states initiated
consultations for a payment system that would be an alternative to the SWIFT
system. The stated goal was to initially move to settlements in national
currencies. The Central Bank of Russia highlighted the main benefits as backup
and redundancy in case there were disruptions to the SWIFT system.

China also launched its alternative to SWIFT: the Cross-Border Interbank
Payment System, which enables financial institutions worldwide to send and
receive information about financial transactions. India also has its
alternative Structured Financial Messaging System (SFMS), as do Russia SPFS
and Brazil Pix.[_citation needed_]

### Potential common currency and BRICS Bridge

BRICS countries committed to study the feasibility of a new common currency or
similar, at the 2023 BRICS summit in South Africa. Fair and easier
international trade, as well as a major reduction in costs of transactions,
would be some of the reasons for the countries to forge a currency union.

BRICS Bridge — a successor to MBridge, and probably a merger with BRICS PAY —
makes it possible for central banks to support cross-border transactions and
payments with their own central bank digital currency (CBDC) based on an
automatic Cross-Border Interbank Payment System for settlement and clearance.
It is designed to be independent of any single nation or central bank, and
every central bank can opt out and has control of their CBDC exchange rate.

One alternative for the currency name has been labelled as "R5" (from the five
currencies renminbi, ruble, rupee, real, and rand), or with other
multilateral. A symbolic banknote was unveiled during the 16th summit in
Kazan, Russia.

In parallel with institutional initiatives, a proposal has been put forward
for a supranational currency known as _UNIT_ , designed by the International
Reserve and Investment Asset System (IRIAS). Each coin would be backed by a
fixed reserve basket of 40% physical gold and 60% fiat currencies, with its
value measured in a gold-equivalent standard. The system is designed to be
decentralized, allowing qualified nodes (sovereign or private) to mint tokens
by depositing the required assets. While not an official BRICS initiative, it
has been discussed as a potential mechanism to facilitate cross-border trade
and investment, reduce reliance on single-nation reserve currencies, and
enhance financial multipolarity.

## Important Issues

### Peace and Security

Kharkiv, Ukraine after the Russian attack on 30 October 2024. The Kazan
Declaration emphasized adherence to the UN Charter and supported diplomatic
efforts to end the war in Ukraine.

At the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan in October 2024, the Kazan Declaration
emphasized adherence to the UN Charter and supported diplomatic efforts for a
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine. It expressed deep concern over
the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian Territory, particularly the
escalation of violence in Gaza and the West Bank, which resulted in
significant civilian harm and displacement. The declaration also noted alarm
over the situation in Southern Lebanon and called for an immediate cessation
of hostilities. Additionally, it highlighted the adverse impact of unilateral
sanctions on the global economy and the achievement of sustainable development
goals.

At the BRICS session on Peace and Security during the 17th BRICS Summit in
Brazil, the leaders echoed and amplified India’s concerns on terrorism while
adopting a resolution condemning the 2025 Pahalgam attack. The declaration
stated that the BRICS nations "condemned in the strongest terms the terrorist
attack in Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025." It called for combating
terrorism “in all its forms and manifestations, including the cross-border
movement of terrorists, terrorism financing and safe havens.” While Pakistan
was not directly named, the reference to cross-border terrorism, according to
Indian sources, was widely interpreted as aimed at Islamabad. The leaders
further urged a stance of zero tolerance, stating that BRICS "rejected double
standards in countering terrorism" and called for the "expeditious
finalization and adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International
Terrorism in the UN framework", as well as “concerted actions against all UN-
designated terrorists and terrorist entities.”

## Reception

World analysts have highlighted potential divisions and weaknesses in the
grouping, including significant economic instabilities, disagreements among
the members over UN Security Council reform, and India and China's disputes
over territorial issues. There is scope for multilateralism in space, and
collaboration in the space governance sector.

ILO Director-General Guy Ryder has positively received joint declarations and
statements of the Labour and Employment Ministers of the BRICS over the years.
These statements cover decent work, social dialogue, green jobs, skills
development, and workers' protection.

### Belgium

Christian E. Rieck of the Global Governance Institute writes in October 2024
that China's relative power distribution in BRICS is "4+1". He notes how China
has pushed for enlargement, while India and Brazil have wanted to maintain the
group’s exclusive relationship with China as well as its non-western stance.
According to Rieck, although BRICS supports multipolarity and non-alignment,
it also does not take an explicitly anti-western stance. He also argues that
BRICS' efforts to construct new financial architectures should not be actively
challenged, as that will only be counter-productive, and that Europe should
not feel threatened by BRICS.

Alicia García-Herrero, who writes for the think tank Bruegel, argued that the
West should note the anti-West sentiment developing amongst BRICS, and that
the West needs to offer the Global South better economic deals.

Reinhold Brender of the Egmont Institute wrote in November 2024 that the pivot
toward BRICS by a number of countries in the Global South, especially visible
during the Kazan summit, should be a "wake-up call" for the EU. To address
this, Brender argued that the EU should think beyond BRICS in relation to the
Global South.

### Brazil

In 2014 results of an opinion poll of 1881 respondents resulted in only 4%
knowing what BRICS stood for; while in 2019 only 3% of 1849 respondents knew
what the acronym stood for.

### Canada

Alissa Wang, co-chair, summit studies, BRICS Research Group, University of
Toronto, in a presentation prepared in July 2023, discusses that the
possibility of BRICS becoming anti-Western is not likely. The group consists
of three democracies – Brazil, India, South Africa, and two non-democratic
regimes – Russia, China –, this political diversity limits the group uniting
on an anti-western stance. Further a BRICS expansion would strengthen the
group economically but political jointness could be negatively affected.

### China

In 2012, Hu Jintao, the then General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party
and President of China, described the BRICS countries as defenders and
promoters of developing countries and a force for world peace.

In March 2025, the government-affiliated think tank Shanghai Institutes for
International Studies (SIIS) published a report where they said that BRICS was
not an anti-Western entity but a non-Western entity seeking a "just and
reasonable post-Western order".

### France

French President Emmanuel Macron sought to become the first western leader at
a BRICS summit in 2023. Russia's Foreign Ministry stated that it would be
"unsuitable" and that France's participation would not help BRICS reach the
goals of developing countries in a multipolar world.

### Germany

A Friedrich Ebert Foundation perspective from September 2013 notes how BRICS
members, for the first time, with Russia as an exception, are really acting on
an international level.

German diplomat Reinhard Butikofer, following the announcement of the
expansion of BRICS in 2023, stated that developing countries may turn to BRICS
"if Europe fails to prove its reliability and credibility as a fair partner".

A Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom policy paper explains that while
the expansion of BRICS is a wake up call, the EU or Germany need not make any
direct formal contact with BRICS until the goals of BRICS are officially
defined. "Western-oriented BRICS countries ... should be more closely
integrated into global governance."

### India

16th BRICS summit in Kazan, October 2024

In 2014, the Indian Marxist author Vijay Prashad raised the limitations of the
BRICS as a political and economic "locomotive of the South" because they
follow neoliberal policies. They have neither established new counter-
balancing institutions nor come up with an alternative ideology. Furthermore,
the BRICS project, argues Prashad, cannot challenge the primacy of the United
States and NATO.

Speaking at the BRICS summit in 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that
"reform of institutions of global governance ... has been on the BRICS agenda
since its inception."

In 2016 Brahma Chellaney writes whether BRICS will be able to construct
institutionalized structures including "institutionalized cooperation". He
writes that BRICS is "the first important non-Western global initiative of the
post-Cold War world".

The Sino-Indian border dispute, for example during the 2020 Galwan Valley
clash, has been a bilateral non-issue for BRICS. In another case where a BRICS
summit acted as a "forcing event", the Doklam standoff in 2017, India stated
that it may pull out of the 2017 BRICS Xiamen Summit, causing China to pull
back its troops and India to attend the summit. During the 2023 BRICS summit
China and India agreed to make efforts to address border issues. However,
following the 2023 BRICS summit, China released a disputed map.

Ashok Malik comments that amid new BRICS members and partners, India should
ensure the group doesn't get an "distortionary ideological edge".

In 2024, India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has stated "because
you won’t let us into the G7 club" with reference to India's participation in
BRICS and the current trend of global governance for emerging economies and
rising powers. The EAM also stated that G7 exists despite G20, so BRICS should
also be allowed to exist.

Prior to the Kazan summit, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stated that BRICS was
never meant to be against anyone or be anti-western, and that it is only non-
western. At the Kazan summit the Prime Minister stated "We must be careful to
ensure that this organization does not acquire the image of one that is trying
to replace global institutions".

Indian diplomat Meera Shankar noted "the new payment systems discussed in
BRICS are still in the exploratory phase and do not pose a challenge to the
dominance of the US dollar in the medium term."

The central bank of India, Reserve Bank of India, Governor Shaktikanta Das,
stated in December 2024 that dedollarization for India was only a part of
"derisking" Indian trade and reducing dependence on any one currency since
that may become "problematic". While a BRICS currency had been raised by a
member state, nothing specific was decided. He also compared the Euro, and
stated how nations in Euro countries are located in close proximity while that
is not the case of BRICS. This was in response to a question about President-
elect Trump warning about tariffs.

Former ambassador D. Bala Venkatesh Varma, in an interview with the think tank
India Foundation, states that India's stance in BRICS is "pro-India" and
"claiming that BRICS is dominated by China is an exaggeration".

At the 17th BRICS Summit held in Rio de Janeiro on 7 July 2025, Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi stated that India would give a “new form” to the BRICS
grouping during its presidency in 2026. He proposed redefining BRICS as
"Building Resilience and Innovation for Cooperation and Sustainability" and
emphasized a people-centric approach, drawing parallels with India’s G-20
presidency where the Global South was prioritized. Modi affirmed that India
would advance BRICS with a focus on "humanity first," highlighting the need
for joint global efforts to address common challenges such as pandemics and
climate change. Modi also called for urgent reform of global institutions to
reflect the realities of the 21st century, emphasizing greater representation
for the Global South and criticizing outdated structures like the UN Security
Council and World Trade Organization.

#### Stance on terrorism

At the 16th BRICS Summit, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated
India’s firm stance against terrorism, urging unified action and warning
against “double standards” in tackling terror and its financing. He called on
BRICS nations to work together to prevent youth radicalization and pushed for
early adoption of the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism at
the UN, highlighting India’s call for credible and consistent global counter-
terrorism efforts.

At the 17th BRICS Summit, Prime Minister Modi strongly condemned the 2025
Pahalgam Attack, calling it a "direct attack on the soul, identity and dignity
of India" and a blow to all of humanity. He urged the international community
to reject double standards on terrorism, stating that "condemning terrorism
should be our principle, not just a convenience," and emphasized that there
should be no hesitation in imposing sanctions against terrorists, regardless
of political considerations. Subsequently, the BRICS declaration acknowledged
India’s concerns, stating, “We condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist
attack in Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, during which 26 people were
killed,” in reference to the Pahalgam attack.

#### Stance on conflicts

At the 16th BRICS Summit in Kazan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reaffirmed
India’s commitment to diplomacy and dialogue, stating that "India stands for
peace, not war." He reiterated India's position on the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, emphasizing the importance of a peaceful resolution through
engagement and negotiation. Modi’s remarks underscored India's broader
approach to global conflict—favoring multilateralism and adherence to the
principles of the United Nations Charter.

### Iran

Iran's admission as a member in 2023 has been touted by the country as a
"strategic success". Sayyid Ebrahim Raisolsadati, as president stated, "the
global confidence in the effectiveness of BRICS is increasing". Foreign
Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian stated that Iran's membership will help in
strengthening the multilateralism of BRICS.

### Russia

Chinese President Xi Jinping at the 16th BRICS summit in Kazan, Russia, 23
October 2024

In 2015, President Vladimir Putin stated that despite BRICS being a young
organisation, it has already been effective. The five countries "are playing
an active part in shaping a multipolar world order and developing modern
models for the world’s financial and trading systems."

In 2024, President Putin speaking at a BRICS forum said "BRICS is one of the
key elements of the emerging multipolar world order, which increasingly
reflects the interests and aspirations of the states of both the global South
and the East ... we are engaged in an active dialogue in the BRICS
plus/outreach format, and are working to establish a category of partner
states". At the Kazan summit President Putin made clear that they are not
attempting to reject the dollar, but rather getting ready with alternatives to
a weaponized dollar.

In a briefing in October 2024 Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman said that
"BRICS framework is non-confrontational and constructive", and that "it is a
viable alternative to a world living by someone else's, alien rules". New
members have made BRICS into a stronger representative of the "Global South
and East – or the Global Majority". Applications from various countries
reinforces BRICS role.

President Putin quoted Prime Minister Narendra Modi in saying that BRICS is
not anti-western but non-western.

A poll following the Kazan summit revealed that 39% of 1500 respondents had
never heard about BRICS. Among those who had heard of the summit, the informal
visual of the BRICS currency banknote was polled as the most unforgettable
happening.

Dmitry Medvedev chaired the International Inter-party Forum in Vladivostok in
the "BRICS and Partner Countries" format, June 2024

In 2025, Victoria Panova, Head of the BRICS Expert Council—Russia, has stated
that while BRICS aims to make a fairer world order, it "doesn’t have an aim of
expansion as an aim in itself." The aim isn't to duplicate the UN's Assembly
General.

In March 2025, President Putin has suggested that BRICS countries could be a
part of the Ukraine peace process.

According to Valdai Discussion Club's Dmitry Suslov in October 2024, there are
many intra-BRICS disagreements. Firstly, prior cooperation and current
relationship with the West is a major factor in making decisions where BRICS
countries are concerned. Secondly, the speed of decision making varies with
respect to making changes in economic governance, say when it concerns a new
currency or settlement mechanism. Third, bilateral relations between countries
such as China and India, and Saudi Arabia and Iran, have not always been
amicable.

### Ukraine

In an October 2024 interview to The Times of India, President Zelensky said
that the Kazan summit in Russia was a total failure. President Zelensky also
criticized the presence of UN secretary general at the summit. The office of
the UN secretary general clarified his participation, referring to BRICS' role
"in boosting global co-operation".

### United States

On 9 April 2013, Isobel Coleman, a director at the American think tank Council
on Foreign Relations, and later U.S. representative to the UN, claimed that
the BRICS members share a lack of consensus. They uphold drastically different
political systems, from vibrant liberal democracies in Brazil and South Africa
to entrenched oligarchy in Russia, and their economies are poorly integrated
and differ in size by orders of magnitude. She also claimed that the
significant difference in GDP influences the reserves: China accounts for over
41% of the contribution, which in turn leads to its bigger political say
within the association.

A multi-year study at Tufts University published in July 2023 found that the
"common portrayal of BRICS as a China-dominated group primarily pursuing
anti-U.S. agendas" was misplaced. The study asserted: "The BRICS countries
connect around common development interests and a quest for a multipolar world
order in which no single power dominates. Yet BRICS consolidation has turned
the group into a potent negotiation force that now challenges Washington's
geopolitical and economic goals".

According to the Atlantic Council's Thomas Hill in December 2023, the de-
dollarization efforts within BRICS, particularly in North Africa, present a
significant challenge to US interests. Replacing the dollar could limit the
US's ability to run deficits and maintain low interest rates, and undermine
the effectiveness of US sanctions and SWIFT.

Michael Kugelman writes in BBC that "Brics projects meant to reduce reliance
on the US dollar likely aren’t viable, because many member states’ economies
cannot afford to wean themselves off of it."

White House Press Secretary and White House National Security Advisor have
said that BRICS isn't seen as becoming a geopolitical rival. Treasury
Secretary Janet Yellen has largely dismissed BRICS efforts at dedollarisation.
Following the announcement of the expansion of BRICS in 2023, the US National
Security Advisor stated that it does not possess a "serious challenge".

In November 2024 in a post on Truth Social, United States president-elect
Donald Trump threatened a 100% U.S. tariff on countries that pursued a BRICS
currency or moved to favor another currency instead of the U.S. dollar. As
U.S. president he announced the same on his first day in office during his
second term. On 31 January 2025, President Trump posted on Truth Social to "go
find another sucker Nation" with respect to BRICS. In February 2025, in a
press briefing, he stated that "BRICS is dead". He went on to say that BRICS
is silent following his "150%" tariff threat.

Joseph Nye writes in January 2025 that BRICS, "as a means of escaping
diplomatic isolation, it is certainly useful to Russia"; the same goes for
Iran. Nye writes that the expansion of the BRICS could bring in more "intra-
organizational rivalries", limiting the groups' effectiveness.

Melissa Pistilli writes that at the 2024 BRICS summit President Putin seemed
to back away from "aggressive calls for de-dollarization [...] but rather to
deter the "weaponization" of the US dollar".

### United Kingdom

After the August 2023 BRICS Summit, Con Coughlin—defense and foreign affairs
editor at _The Daily Telegraph_ —claimed "the challenge BRICS presents to the
established world order seems destined to failure" and accused the
organization of being used by China as a vehicle for expanding its global
influence. Coughlin also noted the contradictions within the organization,
such as the border dispute between China and India, and called for greater
Western engagement with India as part of a new strategic alliance.

In 2024, Jim O'Neill comments the grouping merely generates rhetoric and
symbolism.

### Global opinion

According to a Gallup International poll conducted between October and
December 2023, almost a third of people around the world had never heard of
BRICS but Western countries were much more negative towards the alliance than
elsewhere. The most negative attitudes were found in Sweden (45%), Spain
(30%), the USA (30%), Portugal (29%), and Ukraine (29%) while the most
positive net attitudes were in Russia (38%), Iran (37%), Nigeria (36%), Saudi
Arabia (33%), and Malaysia (32%). In India, 36% had a positive view of BRICS
while 29% had a negative view.
