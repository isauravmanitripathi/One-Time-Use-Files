Asian political and economic intergovernmental organization

The **Economic Cooperation Organization** or **ECO** is a Eurasian political
and economic intergovernmental organization that was founded in 1985 in Tehran
by the leaders of Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. It provides a platform to
discuss ways to improve development and promote trade and investment
opportunities. The ECO is an _ad hoc_ organisation under the United Nations
Charter. The objective is to establish a single market for goods and services,
much like the European Union. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the
ECO expanded to include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in 1992.

The current framework of the ECO expresses itself mostly in the form of
bilateral agreements and arbitration mechanisms between individual and fully
sovereign member states. That makes the ECO similar to ASEAN in that it is an
organisation that has its own offices and bureaucracy for implementation of
trade amongst sovereign member states. This consists of the historically
integrated agricultural region of the Ferghana Valley which allows for trade
and common agricultural production in the border region between Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Pakistan has free trade agreements with both
Afghanistan and Iran which are in the process of implementation.

In 2017, a free trade agreement between Turkey and Iran was proposed to be
signed in the future, in addition to a proposed Pakistan-Turkey Free Trade
Agreement. The Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement is designed to
facilitate trade for goods and services for Central Asia via both Afghanistan
and Pakistan. That is in addition to the Ashgabat Agreement, which is a multi-
modal transport agreement between the Central Asian states. Further
cooperation amongst members is planned in the form of the Iran–Pakistan gas
pipeline, as well as a Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan pipeline. Current
pipelines include the Tabriz–Ankara pipeline in addition to the planned
Persian Pipeline. This is in addition to the transportation of oil and gas
from Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to supply the
industrialisation underway in Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, and beyond. Pakistan
plans to diversify its source of oil and gas supplies towards the Central
Asian states, including petroleum import contracts with Azerbaijan.

The ECO's Secretariat and ECO Cultural Institute are based in Iran, ECO Trade
and Development Bank and ECO Educational Institute are located in Turkey, and
ECO Science Foundation is in Pakistan.

## History

The Economic Cooperation Organization was the successor organisation of what
was the Regional Cooperation for Development (RCD), founded in 1964, which
ended activities in 1979. In 1985 Iran, Pakistan and Turkey joined to form the
ECO. By the fall of 1992, the ECO expanded to include seven new members;
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and
Uzbekistan. The date of the expansion to its present strength, 28 November, is
referred to as "ECO Day". The status and power of the ECO is growing. However,
the organisation faces many challenges. Most importantly, the member states
are lacking appropriate infrastructure and institutions which the Organization
is primarily seeking to develop, to make full use of the available resources
in the region and provide sustainable development for the member nations. The
Economic Cooperation Organisation Trade Agreement (ECOTA) was signed on 17
July 2003 in Islamabad. ECO Trade Promotion Organization (TPO) is a new
organization for trade promotion among member states located in Iran (2009).
Under the agreement reached between ECO members, the common trade market
should be established by 2015.
