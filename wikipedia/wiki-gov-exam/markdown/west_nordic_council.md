The **West Nordic Council** (Danish: _Vestnordisk Råd_ , Greenlandic: _Nunat
Avannarliit Killiit Siunnersuisoqatigiiffiat_ , Faroese: _Útnorðurráðið_ ,
Icelandic: _Vestnorræna ráðið_) is a cooperative forum for the parliaments and
governments of Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Iceland. It was initially
founded in 1985 as the **West Nordic Parliamentarian Council of Cooperation**
but the name was changed in 1997. The council is composed of six MPs from each
nation appointed by their respective parliaments. The annual general meeting
of the council rotates between the members and is its highest authority. A
presidium of three members, including the council's president, oversees the
organization of its work and activities.

The nations of the Council share a somewhat common recent history: Greenland
and the Faroes are autonomous territories of Denmark and Iceland is a former
Danish possession. They also share a similar economic base, all being
dependent on fisheries. The council's main objectives are:

  * To promote West Nordic (North Atlantic) interests.
  * To be guardians of north Atlantic resources and North Atlantic culture and to help to promote West Nordic interests through the West Nordic governments – not least with regards to the serious issues of resource management, pollution, etc.
  * To follow up on the governments' West Nordic cooperation.
  * To work with the Nordic Council and to be the West Nordic link in Nordic cooperation.
  * To act as the parliamentary link for inter-West Nordic organisations, including Arctic parliamentary cooperation.

The West Nordic Council is separate from the Nordic Council, although all of
the members of the West Nordic Council are also members of the Nordic Council
and there is some cooperation between the two.
