Agency of the European Union

Kortenberg building

The **European Defence Agency** (**EDA**) is an agency of the European Union
(EU) that promotes and facilitates integration between member states within
the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The EDA is headed by the
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, European
Commission’s Vice President (HR/VP), and reports to the Council. The EDA was
established on 12 July 2004 and is based in Brussels, Belgium, along with a
number of other CSDP bodies.

All EU member states take part in the agency.

The EDA and the European External Action Service (EEAS), including the EU
Military staff (EUMS), together form the Secretariat of the Permanent
Structured Cooperation (PESCO), the structural integration pursued by 26 of
the 27 national armed forces of the EU since 2017.

## Mission

### Tasks

The council established the EDA "to support the Member States and the Council
in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of
crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as
it stands now and develops in the future". Within that overall mission are
three functions;

  * supporting the development of defence capabilities and military cooperation among the European Union Member States;
  * stimulating defence Research and Technology (R&T) and strengthening the European defence industry;
  * acting as a military interface to EU policies.

EDA acts as a catalyst, promotes collaborations, launches new initiatives and
introduces solutions to improve defence capabilities. It is the place where
Member States willing to develop capabilities in cooperation do so. It is also
a key facilitator in developing the capabilities necessary to underpin the
Common Security and Defence Policy of the Union.

## Organisation

Current organigramme is available here

The Agency is monitored and managed in three ways.

### Head

The EU HR/VP, currently Kaja Kallas, acts as the Head of the EDA. The Head is
responsible for the overall organisation and functioning, ensuring the
implementation of guidelines and decisions and chairing ministerial meetings
of the Steering Board. Javier Solana was the inaugural head of the EDA, a
position which he held from 2004 to 2009.

### Steering Board

EDA's Steering Board is the agency's decision-making body. The Steering Board
is composed of the defence ministers of participating Member States together
with a representative of the European Commission and is led by the Head of the
Agency. The Steering Board is responsible for projects such as the proposed
pan-European Future Transport Helicopter.

### Chief Executive

The Chief Executive (CE, appointed by the HR/VP, is the agency's head of
staff, responsible for the supervision and daily management of the agency.

As of 16 May 2025, Major General André Denk serves as Chief Executive of the
European Defence Agency (EDA), becoming the first high-ranking military
officer to lead the Agency since its creation in 2004.

Before taking up the post, Denk served as EDA’s Deputy Chief Executive from
February 2023, where he led initiatives on joint procurement of 155mm
ammunition to support Ukraine. His military career includes senior roles such
as Director of Logistics at the EU Military Staff and Commander of the
Bundeswehr Logistics School, alongside deployments under EU, UN, and NATO
mandates in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Afghanistan, and Mali.

He succeeded Jiří Šedivý, EDA’s Chief Executive from 2020 to 2025. Šedivý, a
former Czech Defence Minister, was appointed on the recommendation of Josep
Borrell, Head of the Agency.

## Directorates

Since 2019 the agency has been reorganised into four directorates.

### Industry Synergies & Enablers Directorate

The Industry Synergies & Enablers Directorate supports a range of activities
critical to collaborative defence capability development in Europe. On top of
leading the work on identifying, together with Member States, Key Strategic
Activities (KSA) at EU level, the ISE Directorate is responsible for the
effective engagement with industry across the agency's activities and in
support of related priorities set by Member States.

The ISE Directorate facilitates work to address the implications of EU
legislation and policies for the defence sector: REACH, procurement, funding
instruments and the analysis of developments influencing governmental and
industrial stakeholders.

### Capability, Armament & Planning Directorate

The Capability, Armament & Planning Directorate supports the coherent
development of the European defence landscape by integrating EDA's involvement
in the Capability Development Plan (CDP), the Coordinated Annual Review on
Defence (CARD) and the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). The
Directorate also identifies, plans and proposes collaborative opportunities in
support of EU capability development priorities and tailored to Member States'
needs, representing a coherent approach from priority setting to impact.

The Directorate is in charge of preparing the Capability Development Plan,
based on the analysis of military requirements conducted together with Member
States. It also identifies output- oriented EU capability development
priorities and coordinates the development of Strategic Context Cases to
facilitate the implementation of these priorities.

### Research, Technology & Innovation Directorate

The Research, Technology & Innovation Directorate promotes and supports
defence research at EU level. Based on the Overarching Strategic Research
Agenda (OSRA), developed together with the Member States, the Directorate
coordinates and plans joint research activities and the study of technical
solutions to meet future operational needs.

The RTI Directorate provides support to Member States and to the European
Commission for the Preparatory Action for defence research, including its
implementation, and the research dimension of the European Defence Fund. The
Directorate also ensures the promotion of innovation in defence and the
exploitation of synergies at EU level with civil research in dual-use
technology fields.

### Corporate Services Directorate

The Corporate Services Directorate provides business and administrative
support to EDA and includes units such as human resources, finance, IT,
security, and infrastructure management, and the legal office.

## Budget

The agency is financed by its members in proportion to their Gross National
Income. An effect of this is that some nations pay different contributions
towards the budgets than others.

EDA's budget consists of the general budget, the budgets associated with ad
hoc projects or programmes and budgets resulting from additional revenue for a
total budget of €151.847 million in 2022.

This budget covers the Agency's operating costs. Individual projects are
funded separately.

## History

Emblem of the Western European Armaments Group, one of the EDA's precursors

The European Defence Agency is part of several decades of steadily more formal
defence cooperation in Europe. Its work is a continuation of the work of the
Western European Armaments Organization (WEAO) and the Western European
Armaments Group (WEAG) – it effectively represents the transference of their
functions from the WEU to the EU framework, and thus continues the
decommissioning of the WEU.

Established by the European Council in December 2001 following the Laeken
Declaration, the European Convention (also known as the Convention on the
Future of Europe) was a body intended to include the main EU “stakeholders” in
a major brainstorming exercise about the future direction of the European
Union. Its final purpose was to produce a draft constitution for the EU to
finalise and adopt. This period saw a renewed impetus for the creation of a
European Defence Agency.

In its final report, the Convention working group on Defence laid out some of
the foundations of what would become the European Defence Agency we know today
- although the final name wasn’t there yet. “The setting up on an
intergovernmental basis of a European Armaments and Strategic Research Agency
was supported by many in the Group”, the official document stated. “The
Agency’s initial tasks would be to ensure the fulfilment of operational
requirements by promoting a policy of harmonised procurement by the Member
States and to support research into defence technology, including military
space systems.

A year after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EDA set up a project
for the _Common Procurement of Ammunition_ , looking at 155mm artillery rounds
and a longer term project looking at multiple ammunition types, to support
Ukraine and to replenish national stocks. By March 2023, 25 countries had
joined the project. The EDA also signed an agreement in April 2023 with the
United States Department of Defense designed to provide a framework for
transatlantic cooperation on shared defence issues, including supply chains.

### Relationships with non-EU European countries

EU and EDA members

Non-EU countries with an EDA opt-in

The Agency signed Administrative Arrangements with Norway (2006), Switzerland
(2012), Serbia (2013), Ukraine (2015) and the United States (2023) enabling
them to participate in EDA's projects and programmes without exercising voting
rights. All Administrative Arrangements are approved by the European Council.
The Head of the Agency is responsible for negotiating these arrangements in
accordance with directives given by the EDA Steering Board.

The departure of the United Kingdom from the EU in 2020 (Brexit) saw no
mention in the EU/UK agreements of the EDA working with the UK. The UK is one
of the top five defence spenders in the world and its departure meant that
only France, alone in the EU, can conduct full-spectrum military operations
abroad. The UK still maintains a treaty with France for a Combined Joint
Expeditionary Force whether acting bilaterally or through NATO, the EU, or
other coalition arrangements. On 6 October 2022, the UK joined the military
mobility project within the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO)
framework.
