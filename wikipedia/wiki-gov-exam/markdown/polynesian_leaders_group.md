International governmental cooperation group

The **Polynesian Leaders Group (PLG)** is an international governmental
cooperation group bringing together four independent countries and eight self-
governing territories in Polynesia.

The idea of a Polynesian regional grouping had been discussed for several
years, notably in response to the Melanesian Spearhead Group, a regional
grouping for countries in Melanesia. In September 2011, Samoan Prime Minister
Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi initiated a meeting with the leaders of Tonga,
Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and Niue on the margins of the Pacific Islands Forum
summit in Auckland. These initial talks led to a second meeting in Apia which,
on 17 November, led to a memorandum of understanding formally establishing the
Polynesian Leaders Group (PLG).

The Group does not have a fixed Secretariat at present, despite initial
suggestions that one would be established in Apia. The Group held its first
formal meeting in Rarotonga in the Cook Islands in August 2012.

## History

The idea of a 'Polynesian Alliance' in order to address social and economic
issues within the Pacific has been discussed since the between the 1870s and
1890s when King Kamehameha V of Hawaii, King Pomare V of Tahiti, King Malietoa
Laupepa of Samoa and King George Tupou II of Tonga agreed to establish a
confederation of Polynesian states, of which did not eventuate.

The idea once again arose in the 1970s with the Kingitanga of New Zealand, an
its leader Te Atairangikaahu, reviving the idea of an alliance similar to, but
separate from, the Pacific Islands Forum. Fiji and Samoa were also parties to
these discussions.

## Goals

**Memorandum of Understanding**  
Announcing the launch, Prime Minister Tuilaepa said the member countries would
work together "through this group to seek a future for our Polynesian people
and countries where cultures, traditions and values are honored and protected.
Where sustainable economic prosperity is achieved, where democratic values are
observed, human rights promoted and protected as well as upholding the rule of
law." It was also announced that the countries would cooperate in the fields
of "education, culture and language, transport, environmental conservation and
climate change mitigation and adaptation, health, agriculture and fisheries,
tourism, trade and investment".

The fourth section of the Memorandum of Understanding read; The meeting
decided that through the PLG, members will work together in the spirit of
mutual understanding and cooperation to: Encourage sharing knowledge and
experiences in awareness and education to promote and protect cultures,
traditions and languages; Encourage mutual support of development efforts in
areas including but not limited to: transport, energy, environmental
conservation, climate change, education, health, agriculture and fisheries,
tourism, trade and investment; Encourage respect for the quality of
governance, observance of democratic values and human rights rule of law and
right to self-determination; Encourage the strengthening of connections with
institutions of regional and international cooperation.

**Overseas workers**  
In 2013, the PLG ended their annual meeting with an announcement pushing New
Zealand and Australia to increase its seasonal workers quotas in order for
more Pacific peoples to gain seasonal work in these countries.

## Membership

There are eight founding members: three sovereign states (Samoa, Tonga and
Tuvalu), two self-governing states in free association with New Zealand (the
Cook Islands and Niue), an unincorporated territory of the United States
(American Samoa), an overseas country of France (French Polynesia), and a
nation that is also a dependency of New Zealand (Tokelau).

### Expansion

In September 2017, the Group added the French overseas collectivity of Wallis
and Futuna as a member. Wallis and Futuna would be the first new member since
the Group was founded in 2011.

In June 2018, the Group voted to add three members: the sovereign state of New
Zealand, the U.S. state of Hawaii, and the Chilean territory of Easter Island
(Rapa Nui). As far back as September 2011, Niuean Premier Toke Talagi had
noted that "we consider New Zealand and Hawaii, for example, as being part of
the Polynesian Triangle so they could very well be part of the members of this
Polynesian Group". Tuilaeapa, while also acknowledging that New Zealand was
geographically part of Polynesia, said there might be "complications" to
inviting New Zealand into the Group.

When the new members were formally announced, the Group's then-chairman, Enele
Sopoaga, prime minister of Tuvalu, said, "we welcome other Polynesian
communities in other places and locations to join the PLG as brothers," and
emphasized the need for Polynesian communities to come together to address
common problems. Commentators also noted that the addition of New Zealand and
Hawaii could bring additional resources to the Group and increase the
potential for strategic cooperation with the United States. Further, the
addition of Easter Island raised questions about the relationship between the
Group's interest in decolonization and Easter Island's political status within
Chile.
