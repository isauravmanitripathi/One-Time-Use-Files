International organization

The **Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation** (**BSEC**) is a
regional international organization focusing on multilateral political and
economic initiatives aimed at fostering cooperation, peace, stability and
prosperity in the Black Sea region. It traces its origin to 25 June 1992, when
Turkish President Turgut Özal and leaders of ten other countries gathered in
Istanbul and signed the Summit Declaration and the "Bosphorus Statement". BSEC
Headquarters – the Permanent International Secretariat of the Organization of
the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC PERMIS) – was established in March
1994, also in Istanbul.

With the entry into force of its Charter on 1 May 1999, BSEC acquired
international legal identity and was transformed into a full-fledged regional
economic organization: **Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation**.
With the accession of Serbia (then Serbia and Montenegro) in April 2004, the
Organization’s Member States increased to twelve. North Macedonia's accession
in 2020 increased the organization's membership to thirteen.

An important aspect of the activities of BSEC is the development of SME and
entrepreneurship in the member countries. Concerning these issues, a series of
workshops have been organized in cooperation with Konrad Adenauer Foundation
and ERENET.

observers

As seen above, membership has not been restricted to countries which have
access to the Black Sea: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Greece, North
Macedonia, Moldova, and Serbia do not have coastlines on the Black Sea, though
the last two are connected through the Danube river corridor and Greece
through the two sea straits.

North Macedonia's application was vetoed by Greece after Turkey vetoed the
previous application of the Republic of Cyprus, prompting Greece to cease to
approve future applications from any country. However, North Macedonia was
admitted into the bloc on 9 November 2020.
