The **Alliance for Financial Inclusion** (**AFI**) is a policy leadership
alliance owned and led by member central banks and financial regulatory in
developing countries with the objective of advancing financial inclusion.

As of February 2025, AFI had 90 members from 83 countries developing and
emerging economies, representing central banks, financial regulatory
institutions, and financial inclusion policymakers. AFI partners with
regulators in advanced economies, international organizations and private
sector leaders to drive practical solutions and facilitate the implementation
of impactful policy changes through its cooperative model that embeds peer
learning, knowledge exchange and peer transformation.

AFI was founded on the idea that a global knowledge exchange platform was key
to expanding and improving financial inclusion policies. AFI connects,
encourages and enables policymakers to build capacity and develop policy
initiatives in areas of financial technology (fintech), consumer protection,
microfinance, SME finance, gender inclusive finance, inclusive green finance
and other general financial inclusion initiatives in Africa, Asia, Caribbean,
Eastern Europe and Caucasus, Latin America, Middle East and Pacific Islands.
Each year, AFI holds its flagship event, Global Policy Forum (GPF), the
world's largest financial inclusion gathering of policymakers.

AFI is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with regional offices in
Africa and Latin America, and a representation office in Europe.

## History

### Origins and until 2008

In 2006, there was an emerging recognition that policies mattered when it came
to financial inclusion. There is also a huge sentiment around the potential of
digital financial services for increasing financial inclusion for the unbanked
population of the world.

Dr. Hannig described the situation in 2006 as follows:

> "There was a lot of international debate on financial system development and
> what the financial sector can do to alleviate poverty through microfinance.
> ... We were just starting to see the potential of digital financial services
> for increasing financial inclusion for the unbanked."

Through the Gates Foundation, Dr. Alfred Hannig and the Deutsche Gesellschaft
für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) team successfully received grants to
kick-off the first phase of AFI in Bangkok, Thailand and subsequently launched
it in Kenya in 2009.

### 2009 to 2010

Less than two years after its launch, AFI went from an initial founding core
group of five member institutions to members in more than 60 countries,
representing nearly 70 percent of the world's unbanked population.

In 2009, the network saw the first AFI Global Policy Forum, which was held in
Nairobi, Kenya under the theme, _A marketplace of ideas_. Grants to selected
member institutions were introduced.

In 2010, the Group of 20 (G20) nominated AFI as one of three implementing
partners for the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI). In
this role, AFI brought policies for increasing access to financial services
from developing countries to the wider G20 forum and facilitated the
participation of non-G20 policymakers in developing and emerging economies
participate in GPFI work.

### 2011 Maya Declaration

At the 2011 GPF in Mexico's Riviera Maya, AFI members collectively adopted the
Maya Declaration, a global initiative for responsible and sustainable
financial inclusion that aims to reduce poverty and ensure financial stability
for the benefit of all. It is a statement of common principles regarding the
development of financial inclusion policy.

More than 30 countries represented by AFI member institutions, went a step
further by announcing specific and measurable commitments. As of October 2021,
AFI member institutions have made a total of 885 Maya Declarations targets.

The Maya Declaration has paved the way for various other accords. In
recognition of these developments, both the G20 and the Group of 24 (G24)
highlighted the AFI learning model and the Maya Declaration as key steps
toward global economic development, with the G20 urging its members to commit
to the Maya Declaration.

### 2013 to 2018

In **2013** , AFI members adopted the Sasana Accord on Evidence- and Data-
based Results, Accelerated Progress and Measurement of Impact. During the same
year, AFI reached 100 member institutions overall with the addition of the
Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago

In **2015** , AFI members endorsed the Maputo Accord, which commits members to
support access to finance for small and medium enterprises. It also
established its headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, which are hosted by
Bank Negara Malaysia.

In **2016** , AFI completed the final steps in its evolution from an
exclusively donor-funded project into an independent and member-supported
international network of policymakers. Members also endorsed the Denarau
Action Plan for Gender Inclusive Finance to increase women's access to quality
and affordable financial services globally — bridging the financial inclusion
gender gap.

In **2017** , AFI members adopted the Sharm El Sheikh Accord on Financial
Inclusion, Climate Change and Green Finance.

In **2018** , AFI set up its Africa Regional Office in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire,
co-hosted by the country's Ministres de l'Économie et des Finances and Banque
Centrale des États de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO). That same year, AFI also
celebrated its 10th anniversary at its GPF in Sochi, Russia. During the event,
members endorsed the Sochi Accord on FinTech for Financial Inclusion.

In **2019** , a letter of understanding was signed between AFI and the
Ministry of Finance of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to launch a new multi-
donor collaboration framework to bolster financial inclusion across the
African continent. Minister Pierre Gramegna signed the multilateral letter of
undertaking, together with AFI Executive Director Dr. Hannig. The cooperation
is rooted in the support toward the advancement of the Sustainable Development
Goals.

### 2019 onwards: COVID-19 pandemic and AFI's response

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered widespread unemployment and falling levels of
gross domestic product and disproportionately impacting the most disadvantaged
segments of populations. This led to the implementation of AFI's COVID-19
Policy Response, which aimed to systematically deliver coordinated policy
responses to help AFI members mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on financial
inclusion policy implementation, especially for micro, small and medium
enterprises (MSMEs), women, youth, forcibly displaced and other vulnerable
segments of the population.

Virtual engagements were conducted during the lockdown period with technical
teams and leadership across its member countries to address specific issues. A
series of member needs surveys were distributed to enable AFI to deploy rapid
policy response guidelines.

AFI partnered with the Mastercard Foundation to implement a two-year COVID-19
Policy Response program in Africa. The program targeted 49 financial sector
regulators and policymaking institutions across the region to effectively
respond to the economic consequences of the pandemic. In-country
implementation activities were conducted specifically in Nigeria, Uganda,
Rwanda, Senegal, Ghana and the BCEAO member jurisdictions.

Responding to global trends, Dr. Hannig described in 2021 a recent evolution
in financial inclusion:

_“Financial inclusion is no longer just about access to finance and bringing
unreached groups into access to formal financial services. [It] is becoming
more about maintaining high levels of safe and sound financial access, with
increasing usage and quality of financial services … embracing important
issues such as financial health and financial resilience, with the ultimate
objective to ensure financial stability”_ _– Dr. Alfred Hannig, AFI Executive
Director_

## Impact

Since 2009, AFI members have developed and implemented over 920 policy changes
to enhance financial inclusion. 841 million people have been brought into
formal financial systems as a result of AFI activities.

Since 2016, members have attributed over 100 policies and regulations to AFI
annually, an indication that the preparatory work going back many years is
beginning to be realized.

## Organization

AFI's core mission is to empower policymakers to increase the access and usage
of quality financial services for the underserved through the formulation,
implementation and global advocacy of sustainable and inclusive policies.

AFI is the only existing member-based organization with a strong network of
central banks and other financial regulatory institutions, that have a
specific focus or sole mandate on financial inclusion to support empowerment
of the poor and aid the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
through smart policies and regulations~~.~~

It was founded in 2009 by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Bank Indonesia, Bank of
Thailand, Central Bank of Kenya and Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores in
close collaboration and with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
and the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH (GIZ),
AFI was established with the goal of advancing the development of financial
inclusion policy in developing and emerging economies.

In 2016, AFI became an independent, member-owned and member-based globally
operating international organization under Malaysian law.

AFI uses a peer-to-peer learning model to connect, encourage and enable
financial policymakers to interact and exchange knowledge on policy
initiatives. AFI has pioneered knowledge exchange platforms among policymakers
and stakeholders worldwide to build a more comprehensive knowledge base of
financial inclusion. This has led to the formulation and implementation of
effective policies by members institutions within their home jurisdictions.

AFI also operates the AFI Data Portal (ADP), a unique and integrated global
database on financial inclusion policies, regulations and outcomes. Housing
information sourced directly from policymakers and regulators, the ADP
empowers countries to share their financial inclusion stories and formulate
policies through on data while also facilitating the study and understanding
of trends in financial inclusion. The portal is accessible online and publicly
available.

AFI administers financial inclusion policy-related services, including
capacity building, developing-developed country dialogue, grants, in-country
implementation support, knowledge products, regional initiatives and working
groups, global advocacy on financial inclusion

Since the first AFI GPF in 2009, the event has supported an environment of
historic financial inclusion policy initiatives and declarations, including
the Maya Declaration, the first global and measurable set of financial
inclusion commitments by developing and emerging economies.

## AFI Cooperation model

AFI's cooperation model was designed to fulfil the objectives of supporting
members’ financial inclusion agenda. Putting members in the driving seat of
agenda setting for financial inclusion policy, AFI's unique cooperation model
is based on the following principles:

  * Effective governance with Board of Directors and management unit driven by values of transparency, accountability and flexibility
  * Apolitical and non-bureaucratic
  * Full ownership by members who lead and set the agenda for the network's initiatives including Working Groups, Regional Initiatives and capacity building
  * Equality, inclusiveness and equity
  * Solid administrative and financial system with resources focused on operational and financial sustainability
  * Meaningful and binding partnerships with like-minded institutions
  * Permanence and agility
  * Sustainability of AFI services and knowledge resources 

## Working groups

AFI has seven working groups. They serve as the technical backbone for
generating knowledge, guiding and implementing policies, and developing
policies. The working groups produce policy guidelines and tools for
formulating financial inclusion policies, provide peer reviews, and contribute
to the engagement of global standard-setting bodies (SSBs). They also all work
on gender inclusive finance as a cross thematic area and have gender focal
points.

Since the first meeting was held in 2010, working groups have grown rapidly in
size and number. As of March 2022, 76 member institutions from 65 developing
and emerging countries participate in working groups. They represent the
leaders of financial inclusion policy and, together, have passed over 520
policy changes in their respective jurisdictions.

They also represent the thematic areas that AFI actively participates in:

  * **Consumer Empowerment and Market Conduct (CEMC)**

Examines the importance of consumer empowerment and protection to improve the
quality of financial services. CEMC Working Group also advances policy and
regulatory issues related to consumer empowerment initiatives and market
conduct regulations.

  * **Digital Financial Services (DFS)**

Discusses issues related to digital financial services and promotes digital
finance as a major catalyst in achieving financial inclusion in emerging and
developing economies. The working group also develops policy guidelines,
conducts peer reviews and engages the fintech industry and global SSBs.

  * **Financial Inclusion Data (FID)**

Builds knowledge and good practices on areas related to financial inclusion
measurements, such as indicators, methodologies, global standards and
principles.

  * **Financial Inclusion Strategy (FIS)**

Promotes the development, implementation, and monitory and evaluation of
national financial inclusion strategies.

  * **Global Standards Proportionality (GSP)**

Provides technical support on the proportionate application of global
standards while supporting, exchanging and discussing measures that strengthen
and balance both financial sector stability and integrity.

  * **Inclusive Green Finance (IGF)**

Discusses and creates financial policies that build resilience to mitigate and
adapt to the effects of climate change, and to facilitate a just transition
towards a low carbon economy. The IGF since inception in 2019 has developed
and launched 21 knowledge products, 22 peer reviews across several policy and
implementation areas as at 2022.

Some of the knowledge products include:

  1. Roadmap for IGF Implementation
  2. Inclusive Green Finance: From Concept to Practice
  3. Guideline notes on how to integrate IGF into a NFIS and DSS
  4. Measuring IGF
  5. Enabling IGF through DFS
  6. Greening Credit Risk Guarantees.

  * **SME Finance (SMEF)**

Promotes the discussion and implementation of smart policies that facilitate
the access of MSMEs to finance and provides a platform for members to discuss
related challenges and opportunities.

In addition, AFI working groups cover current and emerging global trends that
have the potential for widespread impact. Member institutions have significant
interest in developing policies that mitigate the challenges posed by the
following policy areas:

  * Forcibly displaced persons
  * Gender inclusive finance
  * Inclusive fintech
  * Youth financial inclusion

## Regional Initiatives

Regional initiatives bring AFI closer to its members and strengthen regional
cooperation in financial inclusion. They also enhance the network's ability to
support its members working on specific regional priorities, sharing regional
knowledge and translating global financial inclusion issues into practical
implementation at the regional and national level. The network has five key
regional initiatives:

### African Financial Inclusion Policy Initiative (AfPI)

Source:

AfPI is the primary platform for AFI members in Africa to support and develop
financial inclusion policies and regulatory frameworks, and to coordinate
regional peer learning efforts. From AFI's regional office in Abidjan, Côte
d'Ivoire, AfPI brings together high-level representatives from African
financial policymaking and regulatory institutions to enhance the
implementation of innovative financial inclusion policies across the
continent.

Key AfPI initiatives include leaders’ roundtables, private-public dialogues,
capacity building workshops, developed-developing country dialogues and
meetings of its experts’ group on financial inclusion policy.

As of 2021, 39 AFI member institutions from 37 countries participate in AfPI.
Together, they have implemented 251 policy changes that can be attributed to
the regional initiative's work in financial inclusion. They have also
published 15 knowledge products and 331 Maya Declaration commitments.

### Eastern Europe & Central Asia Policy Initiative (ECAPI)

Source:

Launched at the 2018 AFI GPF in Sochi, Russia, ECAPI aims to resolve regional
challenges and elevate the voice of Eastern European and Central Asian nations
on key financial inclusion policy issues. Countries within the region require
focused and tailored solutions to tackle its financial inclusion challenges,
including low levels of financial literacy, high volume of remittances and
underdeveloped consumer protection policies.

While the region has witnessed significant advancements in financial access in
recent years, at least 121 million people remain excluded from formal banking.
Through the activities implemented in ECAPI, members aim to:

  * Increase access to financial services for the 50 percent unbanked youth.
  * Address the regional six percent gender gap.
  * Reduce the 25 percent gap in access between those with lower and higher levels of education.
  * Focus on advancing financial inclusion for the poorest 40 percent of the population.

As of 2021, seven AFI member institutions in seven countries collaborate under
ECAPI. They have implemented 29 policy changes linked to the regional
initiative's work in financial inclusion, published four knowledge products
and made 53 Maya Declaration commitments.

### Financial Inclusion for the Arab Region Initiative (FIARI)

Source:

FIARI is a regional platform created amid growing demand from member
institutions for tailored solutions to regional financial inclusion issues.
Launched by the Arab Monetary Fund, GIZ and AFI in 2017, and later joined by
the World Bank, it aims to enhance access to financial services in the Arab
region through effective coordination mechanisms and supporting the
implementation of national financial inclusion policies.

As of 2021, FIARI comprises 22 AMF member institutions, including eight AFI
members. Within the AFI network, members’ contributions has led to the
implementation of 34 policy changes and 74 Maya Declaration commitments in the
Arab Region.

### Financial Inclusion Initiative for Latin America and the Caribbean (FILAC)

Source:

FILAC is a regional initiative that aims to be the driving force for advancing
financial inclusion in Latin American and Caribbean countries. It was launched
in 2016 with support from Canada's International Development Research Center.

As of 2021, FIARI's 12 AFI members in 11 countries have implemented 99 policy
changes and published 13 knowledge products. They have made 174 Maya
Declaration commitments.

### Pacific Islands Regional Initiative (PIRI)

Source:

Officially launched in Dili, Timor-Leste, in 2015, PIRI aims to make formal
financial services accessible to all Pacific Islanders through its unique
model of south-south engagement and peer learning. The region has one of the
highest rates of unbanked persons globally due to factors including
geographically dispersed islands, small populations and limited banking
infrastructure.

The initiative invites AFI member institutions to share in a common vision
while working toward ensuring that financial services are widely accessed
throughout the region. With PIRI, AFI has created a unique model of south-
south engagement and peer learning that aims to provide all low-income Pacific
Islanders with access to formal and informal financial services.

As of 2021, the regional initiative comprised eight AFI members in eight
countries. Their work has contributed to 65 policy changes and led to the
publication of eight knowledge products. Members have made 66 Maya Declaration
commitments.

### South Asia Region Financial Inclusion Initiative (SARFII)

Source:

Launched at the 12th AFI Global Policy Forum in Jordan, in September 2022,
SARFII aims to build on the important strides made by South Asian member
institutions over the past decade by acting as a catalyst to accelerate
financial inclusion with an objective to improve lives and make financial
security and inclusion a reality for across South Asia.

## AFI Global Policy Forum

The AFI Global Policy Forum (GPF) is organized annually by AFI and is the
keystone event for its membership and financial inclusion policymakers
globally.

The first GPF was co-hosted by the Central Bank of Kenya in September 2009 in
Nairobi, Kenya, and attracted nearly 100 central bankers and other financial
policymakers, providing a platform for policymakers in developing countries to
engage in dialogue and share knowledge and experiences in expanding access to
financial services.

In his opening remarks, Central Bank of Kenya Governor Prof. Njuguna Ndung'u
summarized the goal of the GPF when he stated: "We will, over the next three
days, share experiences on smart financial inclusion policies that have worked
elsewhere. We will thereafter adopt these policies to suit our respective
countries as we work together to push forward the global financial access
frontiers."
