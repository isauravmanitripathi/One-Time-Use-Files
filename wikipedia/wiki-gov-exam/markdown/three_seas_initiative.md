International political forum of Middle-European states

The **Three Seas Initiative** (**3SI** or **TSI**), known also as the
**Baltic, Adriatic, Black Sea** (**BABS**) **Initiative** or simply as the
**Three Seas** (Latin: _**Trimarium**_ , Polish: _Trójmorze_), is a forum of
thirteen states, in the European Union, running along a north–south axis from
the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic and Black Seas in Central and Eastern Europe.
The Initiative aims to create a regional dialogue on questions affecting the
member states.

In 2016, representatives of the original 13 member states (Austria, Bulgaria,
Croatia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,
Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Greece) met for their first summit in
Dubrovnik, Croatia. At the seventh summit in Riga on 20 June 2022, Ukraine
received the status of a partner-participant of the TSI, _de facto_ becoming a
participant in this initiative. At the 2023 summit, Greece became a member and
Moldova a partner-participant, while at the 2025 summit, Albania and
Montenegro became partner-participants.

## Statistics

The twelve Three Seas countries cover 29 per cent of the European Union's
territory (1,210,000 km2 or 470,000 sq mi), are home to 25 percent of the
European Union's inhabitants (110 million), and produce €2.3 trillion or one
seventh of the EU's GDP (nominal).

## History

The Three Seas Initiative, which was influenced by the Polish interwar
Intermarium concept, was launched in 2015 by Polish President Andrzej Duda and
Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.

### First summit, Dubrovnik, 2016

The Initiative's first summit, held in Dubrovnik, Croatia, on 25–26 August
2016, ended with a declaration of economic cooperation in energy and in
transport and communications infrastructures. Polish President Andrzej Duda
called the initiative "a new concept to promote Europe's unity and cohesion...
an idea of cooperation among 12 countries located between the Adriatic, Baltic
and Black Seas, the three seas of Central Europe."

Guests included Chinese Ministerial Assistant for Foreign Affairs Liu Haixing,
who spoke about Three Seas Initiative interconnectedness with China's Belt and
Road Initiative, and former US National Security Advisor General James L.
Jones, who stressed the Three Seas Initiative's role in European development
and security.

### Second summit, Warsaw, 2017

The Initiative's second summit was held 6–7 July 2017 in Warsaw, Poland. Guest
attendees included US President Donald Trump. The participating countries
unanimously agreed to set up a Three Seas Business Forum.

### Third summit, Bucharest, 2018

The Initiative's third summit took place 17–18 September 2018 in Bucharest,
Romania. Participants approved interconnection projects in three key areas:
transport, energy, and digital. Guest attendees included President of the
European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas,
and US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry. The first edition[_clarification

Commerce was created, and a letter of intent was signed concerning
establishment of a Three Seas Investment Fund.

## Projects

Donald Trump's visit to Poland, July 2017 2018 Three Seas summit in Bucharest

The initiative is closely related to two major infrastructure projects in the
region:

  * A north–south highway "Via Carpathia", connecting Klaipėda in Lithuania with Thessaloniki in Greece
  * Liquefied natural gas infrastructure, with sea terminals in Poland and Croatia and a connecting pipeline

Other projects are the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor, Via Baltica road, Rail
Baltica and Amber Rail Freight Corridor rail connections. Another project is
Rail-2-Sea, which aims to connect the Baltic Sea port of Gdańsk (Poland) with
the Black Sea port of Constanța (Romania) through a 3,663 kilometres (2,276
miles) long railway line.

### Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund (3SIIF)

The initial two founding institutions from Poland and Romania have committed
themselves to make payments totaling more than 500 million euros. The Fund is
open to other Three Seas countries, which may join it after obtaining
appropriate permits. The supervisory board of the Fund consists of
representatives of development banks from Poland, Romania, Latvia, and the
Czech Republic.

In 2019, Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego and Export–Import Bank of Romania signed
the founding act of the Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund. The fund is to
focus on projects creating transport, energy and digital infrastructure in the
Three Seas region. Private investors from pension funds, private investment
funds, and other entities will also be invited to the fund. The aim is to
raise up to €3–5 billion.

The fund will engage, on a commercial basis, in infrastructure projects with a
total value of up to €100 billion, while the needs of the Three Seas region
have been estimated at over €570 billion.

Prior to the 2020 Tallinn Summit, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
pledged up to a billion dollars in financing for the Investment Fund. The
investment was not made.

The fund's assets were estimated at €900 mil. in 2023. The fund is
collaborating with the Amber Infrastructure Group in raising capital and
managing investments.

## Perception

### Croatia

Social-democratic Croatian President Zoran Milanović stated that the
initiative is harmful for Croatia.

### Czech Republic

The Three Seas Initiative was perceived rather negatively by Czech experts and
diplomats during its launch. It was seen as a Polish attempt to create its
sphere of influence (similar to the historical perception of Intermarium).
Further fears were related to a possibility of deepening the east–west
division in the EU and exclusion of Germany. A long term Czech objection was
that there should be no competing geopolitical project in the region that
would weaken the EU. Some of those objections have been partially addressed
lately also due to a good experience with cooperation on infrastructure
projects in the Visegrád Group.[_verification needed_] Further improvement of
Czech position toward the Initiative happened after the term of the president
Miloš Zeman ended and the government could remove from the Czech priority list
the controversial project of Danube-Odra-Labe channel in 2023. The Ministry of
foreign affairs suggested the new priority projects should be the gas
connection STORK II and high-speed rail connection to Poland. On the other
hand, Czechia still does not seem interested in joining the Investment fund or
hosting a summit.

### Finland

The populist Finns Party has advocated for Finland to join the initiative.

### Ukraine

In 2016, Ukraine was sent an invitation to the Three Seas Summit in Dubrovnik.
However, no state representative was sent to the meeting. In August 2019,
during the visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Poland, he
stated that Ukraine is interested in becoming an active participant in
regional projects and initiatives in Poland, such as the Three Seas, which
covers the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. It was also noted that Ukraine is
already cooperating in the construction of the trans-European Via Carpatia
highway, and is discussing an ambitious E-40 waterway project for Ukraine."

In October 2019, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said that Ukraine
could not now join the Three Seas Initiative, as it includes the countries of
Central and Southern Europe, which are members of the European Union. The head
of Polish diplomacy explained that the Three Seas Initiative should not be
associated with geopolitics, as it is only an infrastructure project.

In November 2019, during the visit of the President of Ukraine Volodymyr
Zelenskyy to Estonia, he stated that Ukraine is interested in joining the TSI
and intends to discuss this issue with Estonian partners.

After the start of the 2022 Russian invasion during the Russian-Ukrainian War,
President of Poland Andrzej Duda in his address to the Verkhovna Rada of
Ukraine on 22 May 2022, stated that Ukraine should join the Three Seas
Initiative. Later, on 7 June 2022, the Prime Minister of Poland, Mateusz
Morawiecki, at the opening of a two-day congress of local self-government in
the Three Seas in Lublin, stated that the Three Seas Initiative is impossible
without involving a free and sovereign Ukraine.

At the seventh summit in Riga on 20 June 2022, speaking on video, the
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine should become a
member of the Three Seas Initiative. Zelenskyy suggested strengthening the
interpretation of cooperation within the Three Seas, emphasizing the
importance of logistics. Speaking about cooperation in the energy sector,
Zelenskyy reminded that Ukraine has one of the largest gas storage facilities
in the region. At this summit Ukraine received the status of a partner-
participant of the TSI, _de facto_ becoming a participant in this initiative.
