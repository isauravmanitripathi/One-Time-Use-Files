The **Intergovernmental Group of Twenty-Four on International Monetary Affairs
and Development** , or **The Group of 24** (**G-24**) was established in 1971
as a chapter of the Group of 77 in order to help coordinate the positions of
developing countries on international monetary and development finance issues,
as well as and to ensure that their interests are adequately represented in
negotiations on international monetary matters. Though originally named after
the number of founding Member States, it now has 28 Members (plus China, which
acts as a _Special Invitee_). Although the G-24 officially has 28 member
countries, any member of the G-77 can join discussions.

Although the group is not an organ of the International Monetary Fund, the IMF
provides secretariat services for the Group. It meets biannually, first prior
to the International Monetary and Financial Committee, and secondly prior to
the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the Bank and the
Fund. These meetings allow developing country members to discuss agenda items
prior to these important meetings of the IMF/World Bank.

## Organization

The G-24 operates at two levels:

  * The political level, consisting of Ministers, their Deputies, the Bureau, and other Washington-based representatives who participate in the Committee of the Whole and in any ad hoc meetings; and
  * The operational level, which is run by the G-24 Liaison Office, and includes the G-24 Secretariat and the Research Coordinator.

The governing body of the G-24 meets twice a year, preceding the Spring and
Fall meetings of the International Monetary and Financial Committee and the
Joint Development Committee of the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund. The plenary G-24 meetings are addressed by the heads of the IMF and the
World Bank Group as well as by senior officials of the UN system. Issues are
first discussed by the Deputies and culminate at the Ministerial level by the
approval of a document that sets out the consensus views of member countries.
The Ministerial document is released as a public Communiqué at a press
conference held at the end of the meetings. Decision-making within the G-24 is
by consensus.

### Secretariat

The G-24 Secretariat is a permanent body that serves as the administrative
organ of the G-24. It is based in Washington D.C. in the IMF Headquarters. The
functions and activities of the Secretariat include: ensuring effective
liaison among G-24 members with a view of facilitating consensus on issues of
common interest; overseeing and implementing the work program; building
strategic partnerships and coalitions with other fora engaged in the same
spheres of interest; and supporting the Chair and the Bureau by providing
logistical and secretarial support for the various meetings of the G-24.

Until 1997, the Research Program of the Group was the operational organ for
the coordination of members' policy positions. The program was headed by a
Research Coordinator that directs the policy outputs of the organization. Past
research coordinators include Sidney S. Dell (British), 1975-1990; Gary
Helleiner (Canada), 1990-1997. With the formalization of the establishment of
the Secretariat in 1997 and absorption of the Research program into the
Secretariat function, subsequent research coordinators included the Turkish
economist Dani Rodrik (2002) and Malaysian economist Jomo Sundaram
(2006–2012).

The Secretariat is headed by a Director, who, since 1997, also manages the
G-24’s Research Program.

## Research and publications

The Group also maintains a research and work program that revolves around
issues of importance to developing countries. In particular, the program
focuses on three key areas: The global economy and growth agenda,
international financial architecture, and financing for development. The
global economy and growth agenda emphasizes structural transformation, trade
and technology, and inequality. international financial architecture covers
reform and governance of global financial institutions, the global financial
safety net and managing capital flows, and financial regulation. financing for
development includes taxation and international tax cooperation,
infrastructure financing, debt management and sustainability, and financial
inclusion. Much of the group's research, including books, policy briefs and
working papers can be found on its website.
