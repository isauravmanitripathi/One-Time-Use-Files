International organization for financing infrastructure development in Latin
America

IDB flag.

The **Inter-American Development Bank** (**IDB** or **IADB**) is an
international development finance institution headquartered in Washington,
D.C., United States. It serves as one of the leading sources of development
financing for the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. Established in
1959, the IDB supports Latin American and Caribbean economic, social, and
institutional development and regional integration by lending to governments
and sub-national agencies, developing new financial tools, creating enabling
conditions for private-sector-led growth, convening and aligning countries
around common interests, and bridging the region with the rest of the world.

The IDB also provides extensive technical assistance to its borrowing member
countries. It works across a range of sectors, including infrastructure,
health, education, energy, citizen security, environmental sustainability,
trade, transportation, housing, and small businesses.

It works in conjunction with IDB Invest, which pursues development by
supporting the region's private sector through lending, mobilization, and
advisory services. IDB Lab is the Bank's entrepreneurial innovation and
venture-capital arm.

## History

At the First Pan-American Conference in 1890, the idea of a development
institution for Latin America was first suggested during the earliest efforts
to create an inter-American system. The IDB became a reality under an
initiative proposed by President Juscelino Kubitschek of Brazil. The Bank was
formally created on April 8, 1959, when the Organization of American States
drafted the Articles of Agreement establishing the Inter-American Development
Bank.

The IDB is one of the largest multilateral sources of financing for the Latin
America and the Caribbean region. The IDB provides loans to borrowing member
countries at standard commercial rates of interest, and has _preferred
creditor_ status, meaning that borrowers will repay loans to the IDB before
repaying other obligations to other lenders such as commercial banks.

The IDB has four official languages: English, Spanish, Portuguese and French.
Its official names in the other three languages are as follows:

Language  | Name   
---|---  
Spanish | Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID)   
Portuguese | Banco Interamericano de Desenvolvimento (BID)   
French | Banque interaméricaine de développement (BID)   
  
### Governance

The IDB is governed by its Board of Governors, composed of representatives of
the Bank's 48 member countries. The Governors are usually finance ministers or
other senior economic officials. The Board gathers at an Annual Meeting in
March or April to review the Bank’s operations and make major policy
decisions.

The developing countries that borrow from the IDB are the majority
shareholders, and therefore control the majority of the decision-making bodies
of the Bank. Each member's voting power is determined by its shareholding: its
subscription to the Bank's ordinary capital. The United States holds 30
percent of the Bank's shares, while the countries of Latin America and the
Caribbean combined hold 50.02 percent, with another 20% held by member
countries in Europe and Asia. This arrangement is unique in that the
developing member countries, as a group, are the majority shareholders. Though
this arrangement was first viewed as risky, it is believed by some that strict
peer pressure prevents the borrowers from defaulting, even when under severe
economic pressure.

### Presidents

Name  | Years of Tenure   
---|---  
Felipe Herrera | 1960–1970   
Antonio Ortiz Mena | 1971–1988   
Enrique V. Iglesias | 1988–2005   
Luis Alberto Moreno | 2005–2020   
Mauricio Claver-Carone | 2020–2022   
Reina Irene Mejía [es] (acting)  | 2022   
Ilan Goldfajn | 2022–present   
  
Mauricio Claver-Carone was removed by the governors of IDB after an ethics
investigation found that he had an affair with a subordinate and gave her a
pay raise. The affair allegedly occurred during Claver-Carone's tenure on the
National Security Council during the Trump administration.

Ilan Goldfajn of Brazil was elected on November 20, 2022, and assumed his
responsibilities as president on December 19, 2022.

### Mission

The Bank's mission and slogan is "improving lives." At its 2024 Annual
Meetings, the IDB Board approved a new institutional strategy, predicated on
boosting the impact and scale of the Bank's development work through reforms.
The strategy's three core objectives are reducing poverty and inequality,
addressing climate change, and bolstering sustainable growth. The Board also
approved a doubling of IDB Invest's capital and a new business model,
"originate to share," that aims to significantly increase its ability to
mobilize private capital for development projects. IDB Lab reforms and a
replenishment were also approved. The three major approvals have been dubbed
"IDBImpact+" by the Bank.

## Financial resources

The callable capital pledged by the 22 non-borrowing members, which include
the world's wealthiest developed countries, therefore functions as a guarantee
for the bonds that the IDB sells. This arrangement ensures that the IDB
maintains a triple-A credit rating, and as a result can make loans to its
borrowing member countries at rates of interest similar to those that
commercial banks charge their largest corporate borrowers. At the same time,
the 22 non-borrowing countries are only putting up guarantees – not actual
funds – so their support of the IDB's lending operations has a minimal impact
on their national budgets.

The funds that the IDB lends are raised by selling bonds to institutional
investors at standard commercial rates of interest. The bonds are backed by
(a) the sum of the capital subscriptions actually paid in by the Bank's 48
member countries, plus (b) the sum of the callable capital subscriptions
pledged by the Bank's 22 non-borrowing member countries. Together these
constitute the Bank's _ordinary capital_ , some $101 billion. Of this amount,
4.3 percent is paid in, while the remaining 95.7 percent is callable.

According to the IDB's 2023 Annual Report, the Bank approved 92 sovereign-
guaranteed loan projects for $12.7 billion in total financing that year.
According to IDB Invest, it had a "record year" in 2023, with total activity
surpassing $10 billion, including $5.3 billion in mobilized resources from
private investors. In 2025, IDB President Ilan Goldfajn announced the
intention to increase financing capacity by an additional $130 billion over a
decade.

According to the IDB's own measurements for 2024, 76% of IDB loan approvals,
94% of IDB Invest commitments and 96% of IDB Lab approvals supported
sustainable economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean.

### Latest capital increases

On July 21, 2010, the Board of Governors agreed to increase the Bank's
ordinary capital by $70 billion, the largest expansion of resources in the
Bank's history, and to provide an unprecedented package of financial support
to Haiti. The agreement also includes a replenishment of the Fund for Special
Operations, which finances operations in the region's poorest nations.

A recapitalization and new, pro-mobilization business model for IDB Invest was
approved in 2024.

## Priority areas

According to the Bank's latest institutional strategy, it works in seven focus
areas: 1. biodiversity, natural capital, and climate action; 2. gender
equality and inclusion of diverse population groups; 3. institutional
capacity, rule of law, and citizen security; 4. social protection and human
capital development; 5. sustainable, resilient, and inclusive infrastructure;
6. productive development and innovation through the private sector; 7.
regional integration.

## Criticisms

There are claims that operations funded by the IDB may have adverse impacts on
local environments and indigenous peoples. According to the Bank Information
Center (BIC), "civil society groups have long been concerned about the
negative impacts the IDB's operations have on the environment and on
indigenous and traditional peoples, as well as on the prospects for genuine
economic and democratic reform in the region". The BIC cites environmental and
social damage funded by the IDB as adversely impacting local economies,
contrary to IDB's stated goal of fostering social and economic prosperity.

### Poverty reduction

Governments of developing countries are not equipped to reduce poverty due to
heavy responsibility to build and maintain infrastructure, as well as meet
payroll and debt obligations. Tax revenue is often weak or non-existent.
Poverty reduction depends largely on business investment in global markets to
create sustainable jobs for economic empowerment of individuals. International
companies need funding, and difficulty lies on the inability of the investment
banks to overcome regulatory obstacles.[_citation needed_]

Small business entities are largely responsible for improving lives, as they
play an inherent role in raising the socio-economic status of families, making
it possible to combat poverty in the long range, as employed heads of
household are in better positions to finance the education of children for a
better future. Hence, empowering institutions, such as, the World Bank, IFC,
the IDB, and others can exercise their due diligence to fit those promising
entities in their projects with eased regulatory restraints, as certain
regulations that work in developed nations are obstacles to progress in
developing nations.[_citation needed_]
