## BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement

The **BIMSTEC Free Trade Area Framework Agreement (BFTAFA)** has been signed
by all member nations to stimulate trade and investment in the parties, and
attract outsiders to trade with and invest in the BIMSTEC countries at a
higher level. Subsequently, the _"Trade Negotiating Committee"_ (TNC) was set
up, with Thailand as the permanent chair, to negotiate in areas of trade in
goods and services, investment, economic co-operation, trade facilitations and
technical assistance n. for LDCs. Once negotiation on trade in goods is
completed, the TNC would then proceed with negotiation on trade in services
and investment.

The **BIMSTEC Coastal Shipping Agreement** draft was discussed on 1 December
2017 in New Delhi, to facilitate coastal shipping within 20 nautical miles of
the coastline in the region to boost trade between the member countries.
Compared to the deep sea shipping, coastal ship require smaller vessels with
lesser draft and involve lower costs. Once the agreement becomes operational
after it is ratified, a lot of cargo movement between the member countries can
be done through the cost effective, environment friendly and faster coastal
shipping routes. The necessity for coastal shipping ecosystem and electricity
grid interconnectivity, as two of the necessary components of the evolving
shape of BIMSTEC.

On 7 and 8 November 2019, the first ever **BIMSTEC Conclave of Ports** summit
was held in Visakhapatnam, India. The main aims of this summit is providing a
platform to strengthen maritime interaction, port-led connectivity initiatives
and sharing best practices among member countries.

Connectivity that would provide a framework for regional and domestic
connectivity,

is expected to pave the way for more such exercises in the future, which will
help to further enhance the security cooperation between the BIMSTEC member
countries.

In addition to the military exercises, the MILEX-18 also included a number of
other activities, such as an Army Chiefs' Conclave and a seminar on counter-
terrorism. The Army Chiefs' Conclave was an opportunity for the participating
countries to discuss and share their views on regional security issues. The
seminar on counter-terrorism provided a forum for the participants to learn
about the latest trends in terrorism and to discuss ways to counter it.
