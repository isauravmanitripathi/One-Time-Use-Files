Specialised agency of the United Nations

The United Nations Office at Geneva (Switzerland) is the second biggest UN
centre, after the United Nations headquarters (New York City).

The **World Intellectual Property Organization** (**WIPO** ; French:
_Organisation mondiale de la propriété intellectuelle_ (**OMPI**)) is one of
the 15 specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN). Pursuant to the 1967
Convention Establishing the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO was
created to promote and protect intellectual property (IP) across the world by
cooperating with countries as well as international organizations. It began
operations on 26 April 1970 when the convention entered into force. The
current Director General is Singaporean Daren Tang, former head of the
Intellectual Property Office of Singapore, who began his term on 1 October
2020.

WIPO's activities include: hosting forums to discuss and shape international
IP rules and policies, providing global services that register and protect IP
in different countries, resolving transboundary IP disputes, helping connect
IP systems through uniform standards and infrastructure, and serving as a
general reference database on all IP matters; this includes providing reports
and statistics on the state of IP protection or innovation both globally and
in specific countries. WIPO also works with governments, nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and individuals to utilize IP for socioeconomic
development.

WIPO administers 26 international treaties that concern a wide variety of
intellectual property issues, ranging from the protection of audiovisual works
to establishing international patent classification. It is governed by the
General Assembly and the Coordination Committee, which together set policy and
serve as the main decision making bodies. The General Assembly also elects
WIPO's chief administrator, the Director General, currently Daren Tang of
Singapore, who took office on 1 October 2020. WIPO is administered by a
Secretariat that helps carry out its day-to-day activities.

Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, WIPO has "external offices" around the
world, including in Algiers (Algeria); Rio de Janeiro (Brazil); Beijing
(China), Tokyo (Japan); Abuja (Nigeria); Moscow (Russia); and Singapore
(Singapore). Unlike most UN organizations, WIPO does not rely heavily on
assessed or voluntary contributions from member states; 95 percent of its
budget comes from fees related to its global services.

WIPO currently has 193 member states, including 190 UN member states and the
Cook Islands, Holy See and Niue; Palestine has permanent observer status. The
only non-members, among the countries recognized by the UN are the Federated
States of Micronesia, Palau and South Sudan.[_citation needed_]

## History

### Pre BIRPI

#### 1883 – Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property

The Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property was adopted in
1883 and was one of the first intellectual property treaties. It established a
Union for the protection of industrial property. Additionally, it applies to a
wide range of industrial property including patents, trademarks, utility
models, industrial designs, trade names, service marks, geographical
indications as well as the "repression of unfair competition". The Paris
Convention was the first international agreement to protect the works of
creators in other countries.

Moving on, the Convention was adopted in diplomatic conferences held in Paris
in 1880 and 1883, it was then signed on 20 March 1883, on behalf of Brazil,
France, Guatemala, Netherlands, Portugal, Serbia, Spain and Switzerland,
Belgium, Italy and El Salvador. It consisted of the Convention proper, which
contains 19 articles, and the _Protocole de clôture_ (Final Protocol), which
is almost the same length as the Convention proper.

The "International Bureau" established by the Paris Convention for the
Protection of Industrial Property later became part of BIRPI and later WIPO.

#### 1886 – Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works

The Berne Convention was adopted in 1886, it deals with copyright, the
protection of works and rights of authors and rights holders. It provides
creators including writers, poets, painters, musicians with ways to control
how and by who their works are used and the terms of use. It also contains
provisions on minimum protections and special provisions for developing
countries. The Convention follows three basic principles; that works
originating in one of the Contracting States must be given the same protection
in each of the other Contracting States (principle of "national treatment"),
that there is automatic protection and no formal process is required and that
protection under the convention is independent of protection in the country of
origin of the work (principle of "independence" of protection). The
"International Bureau" was created to oversee the Berne Convention and later
became part of BIRPI and later WIPO.[_citation needed_]

#### 1891 – Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of
Marks

In 1891 nine of the 14 States to the Paris Convention for the Protection of
Industrial Property created the first "special arrangements for the protection
of industrial property". Along with the Protocol Relating to the Madrid
Agreement (1989) it created the Madrid System, the primary international
system for facilitating the registration of trademarks in multiple
jurisdictions around the world.

### BIRPI

The Bureaus created to administer the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literary and Artistic Works and the Paris Convention for the Protection of
Industrial Property were under "the high supervision" (_haute surveillance_)
of the Government of the Swiss Confederation. In 1893 the Swiss government
combined them with the same director and same staff as United International
Bureaux for the Protection of Intellectual Property, _Bureaux internationaux
réunis pour la protection de la propriété intellectuelle_ (BIRPI). BIRPI was
the predecessor of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) which
superseded it 87 years later, in 1970.

### Formation of WIPO

WIPO was formally created by the Convention Establishing the World
Intellectual Property Organization, which entered into force on 26 April 1970.
WIPO allowed members who were part of the Berne Convention, Paris Convention
or a member of the United Nations system including the United Nations, any of
its specialized agencies, the International Atomic Energy Agency or the
International Court of Justice.

That date is commemorated annually as World Intellectual Property Day, which
raises awareness of the importance of IP. Under Article 3 of this convention,
WIPO seeks to "promote the protection of intellectual property throughout the
world". WIPO became a specialized agency of the UN in 1974. The Agreement
between the United Nations and the World Intellectual Property Organization
notes in Article 1 that WIPO is responsible:

> for promoting creative intellectual activity and for facilitating the
> transfer of technology related to industrial property to the developing
> countries in order to accelerate economic, social and cultural development,
> subject to the competence and responsibilities of the United Nations and its
> organs, particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,
> the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Industrial
> Development Organization, as well as of the United Nations Educational,
> Scientific and Cultural Organization and of other agencies within the United
> Nations system.

The Agreement marked a transition for WIPO from the mandate it inherited in
1967 from BIRPI, to promote the protection of intellectual property, to one
that involved the more complex task of promoting technology transfer and
economic development.[_need quotation to verify_]

### WIPO joining the United Nations

WIPO headquarters, Geneva

In 1974 WIPO became a specialized agency of the United Nations through a
bilateral agreement between WIPO and the UN approved by the General Assembly
of WIPO on 27 September 1974, and by the UN General Assembly on 17 December
1974. A protocol was signed by then Secretary-General of the United Nations,
Kurt Waldheim and then Director General of WIPO Árpád Bogsch on 21 January
1975. The Agreement became effective on 17 December 1974.

The relative importance of WIPO in global IP governance decreased after the
United States incorporated intellectual property matters into the Uruguay
Round of the GATT Negotiations in the 1980s.

### WIPO Development agenda

In October 2004, WIPO agreed to adopt a proposal offered by Argentina and
Brazil, the "Proposal for the Establishment of a Development Agenda for
WIPO"—from the Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual
Property Organization. This proposal was well supported by developing
countries. The agreed "WIPO Development Agenda" (composed of over 45
recommendations) was the culmination of a long process of transformation for
the organization from one that had historically been primarily aimed at
protecting the interests of rightholders, to one that has increasingly
incorporated the interests of other stakeholders in the international
intellectual property system as well as integrating into the broader corpus of
international law on human rights, environment and economic cooperation.

A number of civil society bodies have been working on a draft Access to
Knowledge (A2K) treaty which they would like to see introduced.

In 2009, WIPO started drafting future treaties on intellectual property and
genetic resources, traditional knowledge and folklore in relation with
indigenous peoples and local communities.

In December 2011, WIPO published its first World Intellectual Property Report
on the Changing Face of Innovation, the first such report of the new Office of
the Chief Economist. WIPO is also a co-publisher of the Global Innovation
Index.

### Recent events

WIPO members

Members

Non-members

In 2016, WIPO initiated the High-Level Conference on Intellectual Property for
BRI Countries. WIPO Director General Francis Gurry encouraged countries
participating in the Belt and Road Initiative to use WIPO tools like its
global IP services and databases and to join WIPO-administered IP treaties.

In September 2020 China blocked the Wikimedia Foundation from observer status
at WIPO citing the existence of a Wikimedia affiliate in Taiwan. According to
the Chinese statement "there is reason to believe that this foundation has
been carrying out political activities through its member organizations which
could undermine the state's sovereignty and territorial integrity." China
again rejected Wikimedia's bid, for the same reason, in 2021, 2023, 2024, and
2025.

WIPO, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the WTO launched on 11 April
2022 their new Trilateral COVID-19 Technical Assistance Platform. This new
tool aims to help members and WTO accession candidates address their capacity
building needs to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Platform provides
members and accession candidates with a single contact form which they can use
to reach out to the trilateral organizations.

## Global services

### Patent Cooperation Treaty

The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (1970) established a service which assists
individuals, companies, and institutions in seeking patent protection
internationally for their inventions. It also helps patent offices with their
patent granting decisions and facilitates public access to technical
information relating to those inventions. 153 countries are currently party to
the PCT.

Under the PCT, an applicant can file one PCT application in one language, at
one patent office, within 12 months from the date of the earliest patent
application which has been filed for the same invention (the "priority date").
This one PCT application has the same legal effect as filing separate regional
or national patent applications in all PCT member countries.[_citation
needed_]

PCT applications are processed in a standardized manner as provided in the
Treaty and Regulations, including an international search for documents
relevant to the potential patentability of the invention and international
publication. Granting patents remains under the control of the regional or
national patent Offices in the "national phase".

Using the PCT, patent applicants can postpone paying national and regional
patent-related fees while they learn about the likelihood of obtaining a
patent, benefitting from the additional time and information to help them
decide whether, and in which countries, to pursue patents.

### Madrid System

The Madrid System for the International Registration of Marks serves as a
means to seek protection for trademarks worldwide, in over 120 countries.
Created in 1891, the Madrid System is now governed by the Madrid Protocol
Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of
Marks (1989). In order to become a member of the Madrid System, a state or
intergovernmental organization must already be a party to the Paris Convention
for the Protection of Industrial Property (1883).

The Madrid System is a centralized trademark registration system: through a
single application, in one language and with one set of fees (in one currency,
the Swiss franc), protection can be obtained in member states and
intergovernmental organizations. International registrations can then be
modified, renewed or expanded, centrally through WIPO (rather than through
each separate IP Office).

The Madrid System can only be used by a natural person or a legal entity,
which is a national, is domiciled or has a company in the territory of a
member of the Madrid System.[_citation needed_]

### Lisbon System

The Lisbon System for the International Registration of Appellations of Origin
and Geographical indications provides a means of obtaining international
protection for a geographical indication or an appellation of origin.
Geographical indications and appellations of origin are intellectual property
rights which identify a product that originates from a specific geographical
area and that has characteristics that are attributable to its geographical
origin. Comté cheese (France), Chulucanas pottery (Peru), Tequila (Mexico),
Porto (Portugal), Herend porcelain (Hungary), and Kampot pepper (Cambodia) are
examples of appellations of origin and geographical indications registered
under the Lisbon System. Through a single registration and one set of fees,
protection can be obtained in the other countries (and intergovernmental
organizations, such as the European Union) covered by the Lisbon System.

The Lisbon System includes the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of
Appellations of Origin and their International Registration of 1958 ('the
Lisbon Agreement') and, its latest revision, the Geneva Act of the Lisbon
Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications of 2015 ('the
Geneva Act') form the Lisbon System. Registrations under the Lisbon System are
published in the official bulletin and can be searched through the Lisbon
Express Database.

### WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center

The WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center was established in 1994 as an
international resource for alternatives to court litigation of intellectual
property and technology disputes. It offers alternative dispute resolution
(ADR) options including mediation, arbitration, and expert determination to
resolve international commercial disputes between private parties. It is an
administrator of cases and a provider of legal and policy expertise. The
Center also provides domain name dispute resolution services under the WIPO-
designed UDRP. It is based in Geneva, Switzerland and since 2010 the Center
has had an office at Maxwell Chambers in Singapore.

### Hague System

The WIPO Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial Designs
provides an international mechanism for securing protection of up to 100
designs in multiple countries or regions, through a single international
application, filed in one language and using one currency (Swiss francs).

International design applications are filed directly through WIPO, according
to the requirements and procedures established by the Hague Agreement. The
domestic legal framework of each designated contracting party governs the
design protection provided by the resulting international registrations.

According to the rules laid out by the Hague Agreement, anyone who is a
national of, or who has a domicile, habitual residence or real and effective
industrial or commercial establishment in any Hague System contracting party –
including any country of the European Union or the African Intellectual
Property Organization – can use the Hague System. The Hague System does not
require the applicant to file a national or regional design application.

On 5 February 2020, China officially deposited its accession documents for
entering the Hague System for the International Registration of Industrial
Designs and the Marrakesh Treaty (which increases the accessibility of
publications to people with visual impairment), before the commencement of the
Beijing Olympic Winter Games. The accession will take effect on 5 May
2022.[_citation needed_]

China became the 68th contracting party to the Geneva Act (1999) of the Hague
Agreement and, therefore, the 77th member of the Hague System.

## Funding

WIPO, unlike other UN agencies, derives most of its income from fees for the
Global IP services it provides as opposed to Member States contributions. In
2020, WIPO's revenue amounted to CHF 468.3 million. In 2020 WIPO generated
over 94.3% of its revenue from fees that are paid by users of its intellectual
property services for patents, trademarks and industrial designs due to
international demand for intellectual property titles. These services are
provided through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) (providing 76.6% of
revenue), Madrid System (providing 16.3% of revenue) and Hague System
(providing 1.4% of revenue).

## Governance and normative work

### WIPO Assemblies

WIPO Assemblies develop global intellectual property agreements through
bringing stakeholders together. The main policy and decision making bodies of
WIPO are the Coordination Committee and the General Assembly. Twenty-two
Assemblies, the Unions administered by WIPO, and other bodies of the Member
States of WIPO meet in ordinary or extraordinary sessions in autumn. The
General Assembly appoints the Director General through nomination by the
Coordination Committee. Any of the policy and decision making bodies can
constitute Permanent Committees or Standing Committees.

### Standing Committees

Standing committees are ad hoc groups of experts established for a given
purpose and acting as a place for policy discussions and negotiations on the
future development of intellectual property. Any WIPO Standing Committee or
other bodies also decide to establish a working group to examine a question in
more detail, make suggestions or give advice on any subject within the
competence of the Organization.

### WIPO administered treaties

WIPO administers 26 treaties, including the WIPO Convention.

#### Classification treaties

Classification treaties that create classification systems that organize
information concerning inventions, trademarks and industrial designs.

Name  | Description  | History   
---|---|---  
Locarno Agreement Establishing an International Classification for Industrial Designs | The Locarno Agreement establishes a classification for industrial designs (the Locarno Classification)  | Signed at Locarno on 8 October 1968, and amended on 28 September 1979   
Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks |  International Classification of Goods and Services also known as the Nice Classification was established by the Nice Agreement (1957), is a system of classifying goods and services for the purpose of registering trademarks.

## Policy work

### Genetic resources, traditional knowledge and traditional cultural
expressions

For years, many local communities, Indigenous peoples and governments have
sought effective intellectual property (IP) protection for traditional
cultural expressions (folklore) and traditional knowledge as tradition-based
forms of ingenuity and creativity. As a living body of knowledge developed,
sustained and passed on from generation to generation within a community, it
is not easily protected under the current IP system, which typically grants
protection for a limited period to new inventions and original works as
private rights. Some genetic resources, too, are linked to traditional
knowledge and related practices through their use and conservation by
Indigenous peoples and local communities. Although genetic resources, as
encountered in nature, are not eligible for IP protection, inventions based on
or developed with the use of genetic resources may be patentable. Since 2010,
the Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic
Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore (IGC) has been negotiating the
text of one or several legal instruments on the matter.
