Multilateral development bank of the BRICS member countries

The **New Development Bank** (**NDB**), formerly referred to as the **BRICS
Development Bank** , is a multilateral development bank established by the
BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). According to
the agreement, "the bank shall support public or private projects through
loans, guarantees, equity participation and other financial instruments" and
"shall cooperate with international organizations and other financial
entities, and provide technical assistance for projects to be supported by the
bank."

The initial authorized capital of the bank was US$100 billion divided into one
million shares having a par value of US$100,000 each. The initial subscribed
capital of the bank was US$50 billion divided into US$10 billion in paid-in
shares and US$40 billion in callable shares. It was equally distributed among
the five founding members–Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa. The
agreement on the NDB specifies that each founding member will have one vote
and that no member would have any veto powers.

The bank is headquartered in Shanghai, China. The first regional office of the
bank was opened in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2016. Subsequently, regional
offices were established in São Paulo in Brazil, Ahmedabad in India and Moscow
in Russia.

## History

The idea for setting up the bank was proposed by India at the 4th BRICS summit
in 2012 held in New Delhi. As the establishment of a development bank would
help in simplifying mutual settlement and lending operations amongst the BRICS
nations, reducing dependence on the US dollar and the Euro, the leaders of
these nations agreed to set up anew multilateral development bank at the 5th
BRICS summit held in Durban, South Africa on 27 March 2013. On 15 July 2014,
on the first day of the 6th BRICS summit held in Fortaleza, Brazil, the five
member states signed the agreement on the New Development Bank, which made
provisions for the legal basis of the bank. In a separate agreement, a reserve
currency pool worth US$100 billion was set up by the members.

minister Narendra Modi in May 2015

On 11 May 2015, K. V. Kamath was appointed as the first president of the bank.
According to the bank, the policies and procedures for all functional areas
were approved at the board of directors meeting in January 2016. On 27
February 2016, the NDB signed an agreement with the Government of China and
local government of Shanghai to establish the headquarters of the bank in
Shanghai. On 19 July 2016, the NDB reported that it successfully issued the
bank's first green financial bond with issue size of RMB 3 billion, with a
tenure of five years in the China interbank bond market.

NDB Creation Milestones

On 20 July 2016, the first annual meeting of the NDB board of governors was
held in Shanghai. The participants of the meeting discussed the bank's future
work and development and gave a positive assessment to the bank's work. At the
meeting, the first green financial bond issuance in renminbi was highlighted
as a milestone event for the NDB. In 2016, the NDB board of directors approved
the first set of projects in all members of the bank. On 21 December 2016, the
NDB signed its first loan agreement. The NDB received AA+ credit ratings from
S&P Global Ratings (S&P) and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) in August 2018, which
enables the bank to offer full suite of financial products to its public and
private sector clients. In April 2020, the New Development Bank established an
Emergency Assistance Facility that sought to finance costs related to the
fight against the Coronavirus and soften the blow from the economic impact. In
addition to committing US$5 billion to this cause, the NDB targeted to provide
up to 10 billion dollars.

In March 2022, the NDB announced that "sound banking principles" required that
all new transactions with Russia be put on hold. Even though the NDB quickly
cut ties with Russia, Fitch Ratings still downgraded the NDB from stable to
negative on its Long-Term Issuer Default scale. In May 2022, the New
Development Bank set up a regional office in India in the state of Gujarat
with the goal of financing and observing infrastructure projects in both India
and Bangladesh. In May 2023, Saudi Arabia expressed its intention to join the
NDB.

## Structure and Objectives

### Corporate Governance

According to the Articles of Agreement, the main organs of the bank are:

  * Board of governors
  * Board of directors
  * President and vice-presidents

Information about the composition of the NDB board of governors is available
on the bank's official website.

The NDB president is elected on a rotational basis from one of the founding
members, and there are four vice presidents from each of the other four
founding members.

K. V. Kamath, from India, is the first elected president of the NDB. He was
replaced as president by Marcos Prado Troyjo from Brazil since 7 July 2020.
Marcos Troyjo was elected president of the New Development Bank on 27 May
2020. Following Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva election, the Brazilian government
solicited his renouncement, after then he was replaced by Dilma Rousseff by 24
March 2023.

### Capital

The New Development Bank has an initial subscribed capital of US$50 billion
and an initial authorized capital of US$100 billion. The initial subscribed
capital is equally distributed among the founding members. The payment of the
amount initially subscribed by each founding member to the paid-in capital
stock of the bank will be made in dollars in 7 installments. Each member
cannot increase its share of capital without all other four members agreeing.
The bank will allow new members to join but the BRICS capital share cannot
fall below 55%.

### Objectives

The bank aims to contribute to the development plans established nationally
through projects that are socially, environmentally and economically
sustainable. Taking this into account, the main objectives of the NDB can be
summarized as follows

  1. Promote infrastructure and sustainable development projects with a significant development impact in member countries.
  2. Establish an extensive network of global partnerships with other multilateral development institutions and national development banks.
  3. Build a balanced project portfolio giving a proper respect to their geographic location, financing requirements and other factors.

In 2016, some experts considered that expanding the NDB's membership to be
crucial to its long-term development by helping boost the bank's business
growth.

According to the Bank's General Strategy: 2017–2021, the NDB plans to expand
membership gradually so as not to overly strain its operational and decision-
making capacity.

## Activities

### Projects

According to the Bank's General Strategy, sustainable infrastructure
development is at the core of NDB's operational strategy in 2017–2021, and the
Bank will dedicate about two-thirds of financing commitments in its first five
years to this area.

The New Development Bank is planning to give a priority to projects aimed at
developing renewable energy sources. As it was stated by the bank, it wants to
cooperate with other institutions in accelerating ‘green’ financing expansion
and promoting environment protection.

Breakdown of NDB's loan approvals by sector (as of 1 August 2018)

The NDB has expressed interest in funding projects that conform to high
environmental standards, including those in the field of infrastructure, such
as energy, railways and highways in the future. At the same time, according to
K. V. Kamath, the NDB President, one of the key strategies of the bank will be
financing profitable projects (bankable) with return on capital. The NDB wants
"to fund projects that are creative and bring benefits to the local people and
environment", said Vice President Zhu Xian.

The leadership of the member countries task the bank with developing a strong
pipeline of projects and responding in a fast and flexible manner to
aspirations and interests of its members.

As of 6 March 2019, the NDB Board of Directors approved 30 projects with loans
aggregating over approx. USD 8 billion.

The bank has begun non-sovereign operations with loans approved in Brazil,
South Africa, and Russia. In May 2024, BRICS Development Bank announces to
allocate US$1.115 bi to Rio Grande do Sul for rebuilding the urban and rural
infrastructure after the 2024 floods.

### Bonds

In March 2016, the NDB announced that it will do a bond issue in China to
raise funding domestically on the Chinese market. The bond issue is likely to
happen in the second quarter of the year 2016, said the NDB Vice President
Leslie Maasdorp. He added the bank is starting to finalize the exact size of
this bond issue.

On 18 July 2016 the NDB successfully issued its first green financial bond
with issue size of RMB 3 billion, tenor of 5 years in China onshore interbank
bond market. The bond's nominal interest rate is 3.07%. The bank became the
first international financial institution that issued a green financial bond
in the China onshore bond market. The proceeds of the bond will be used for
infrastructure and sustainable development projects in the member countries.

In February 2019, the bank successfully placed CNY 3 billion RMB-denominated
bond in the China Interbank Bond Market, and it was priced at the lower end of
announced pricing range.

On May 18, 2022, the New Development Bank issued a 7 billion RMB - 3 year bond
into the Chinese Interbank Bond Market (CIMB), making it the largest bond ever
made by foreign issuers. It received an Issuer Rating(IR) of AA+ from both S&P
and Fitch.

## Relations with other institutions

### Approach

The Articles of Agreement of the bank say that the NDB was established to
complement the existing efforts of multilateral and regional financial
institutions for global growth and development. Moreover, the NDB is
authorized by its founders to cooperate within its mandate with other
international organizations, as well as national entities (public or private),
in particular with international financial institutions and national
development banks.

The NDB President K.V.Kamath stresses that the bank regards other
international financial institutions, including IMF and World Bank as
partners, not rivals.

### Asian Development Bank

In July 2016, the NDB signed with Asian Development Bank (ADB) a memorandum of
understanding on strategic cooperation. The two institutions expressed
willingness to work together through co-financing and knowledge exchanges in
areas including sustainable development projects in renewable energy, energy
efficiency, clean transportation, sustainable water management, and sewage
treatment.

### Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank

According to a representative of the Bank's management, the NDB and AIIB are
sister institutions in many respects. These two banks have complementary
mandates and different geographic focuses, with the NDB being more focused on
BRICS countries. At the same time, there is a certain overlapping between
mandates of the NDB and the AIIB, as both of them are aimed at developing
infrastructure and pay a special attention to sustainable development.
However, due to the fact that current financing and investment patterns are
inadequate in meeting investment needs, there is "space for newcomers", he
said.

In February 2016, the president of the NDB dismissed concerns over overlapping
of interests of China-backed AIIB and the NDB.

### World Bank

According to media reports, other multilateral development institutions,
including the World Bank Group (WBG), have expressed an intention to work
together with the NDB. In September 2016, NDB and World Bank Group signed a
memorandum of understanding on cooperation and it was announced that the NDB
and WBG's cooperative efforts will focus primarily on infrastructure.

## Reception

### Prominent scholars

In July 2014, Nobel Prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said the NDB marks
a "fundamental change in global economic and political power." In his opinion,
"The existing institutions just don't have enough resources."

In the analysis of academic Suisheng Zhao, China's role in the creation of the
NBD is "a symbolic gesture to create a sort of IMF clone writ small toward
reshaping the Western-dominated international financial architecture."

### Officials

Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called the opening of the NDB an "important step
forward" in cooperation among BRICS countries. "This is great progress in
financial cooperation among developing countries and emerging economies, as
well as a helpful supplement to the global financial system," Li Keqiang said
at a meeting with K. V. Kamath in Beijing in July, 2015.

China Finance Minister Lou Jiwei said that the establishment of the NDB and
the Beijing-led AIIB would encourage existing multilateral institutions to do
better. At a news conference at the conclusion of the G20 meeting of finance
ministers and central bank governors in Shanghai he added that the New
Development Bank could help drive aggregate global demand.

### Bankers

8 July 2015, VTB CEO Andrey Kostin said that the NDB is "important because
it's a first institution created by the BRICS countries." "Actually we are
talking about the institutionalization of the BRICS process, and that's quite
important I think. It's a permanent working instrument which will be working
every day and which will be in the heart of BRICS cooperation," he added.

According to former Reserve Bank of India governor Raghuram Rajan, the NDB "Is
a co-operative effort between all BRICS countries." "We have already reached
contingency reserve agreement (CRA). This is second. Let's see how it
develops. Lots of hopes embedded in it for greater cooperation (among the)
BRICS countries," he told reporters in February 2016.

## Logo and identity

The logo of the NDB in the bank's HQ in Shanghai

The logo of the New Development Bank borrows from the mathematical concept of
a Mobius strip that symbolizes the idea of continuous transformation. Its
nature is not to disrupt but drive change in the existing system from within.

The logo consists of a triangle in motion at one end signifying balanced
evolution. The other end, moving in the opposite direction, is a propeller
that represents speed and dynamism. These two entities are held together by a
wireframe, the skeletal basic of infrastructure. The logo is rendered in
gradient of green that symbolizes sustainability. This constant motion
symbolizes the values that the bank strives to live by – agility, innovation
and continuous transformation.
