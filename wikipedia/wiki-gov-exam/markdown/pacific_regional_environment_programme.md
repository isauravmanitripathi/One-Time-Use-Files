Organization

The **Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme** (**SPREP**)
is an intergovernmental organisation based in Apia, Samoa with more than 90
staff members. The organisation is held accountable by the governments and
administrations of the Pacific region to ensure the protection and sustainable
development of the region's natural resources. The organisation actively
promotes the understanding of the connection between Pacific island people and
their natural environment and the impact that these have on their sustenance
and livelihoods. The organisation was established in 1982. Previously **South
Pacific Regional Environment Programme** , the word "South" was replaced with
"Secretariat" in 2004, in recognition of the members north of the equator. The
French equivalent name is _Programme régional océanien de l’environnement_
(PROE).

## Governance

The SPREP Annual General Meeting is the main governance mechanism of the
organisation. SPREP Members meet once every year to discuss the workplan and
budget and other matters relating to administration and corporate affairs. The
25th SPREP Meeting was held in the Republic of the Marshall Islands in October
2014.

SPREP began life in the late 1970s as a joint initiative of SPC, SPEC, ESCAP
and UNEP - eventually functioning as a component of UNEP's Regional Seas
Programme. The Programme received further impetus as a result of the 1982
Conference on the Human Environment in the South Pacific. Following a period
of expansion and long deliberations, SPREP left SPC in Nouméa in 1992 and
relocated to Samoa. It achieved autonomy as an independent inter-governmental
organisation with the signing of the Agreement Establishing SPREP in Apia on
16 June 1993.

SPREP (the Secretariat) is the region’s key inter-governmental organisation
for environment and sustainable development, and is one of several inter-
governmental agencies comprising the Council of Regional Organisations in the
Pacific (CROP). Under the Agreement Establishing SPREP, the purposes of SPREP
are to promote cooperation in the South Pacific Region and to provide
assistance in order to protect and improve the environment and to ensure
sustainable development for present and future generations (Art.2). SPREP's
vision is: the Pacific environment - sustaining our livelihoods and natural
heritage in harmony with our cultures. SPREP also functions as the Secretariat
of 2 (formerly 3) regional conventions: the Nouméa Convention, the Waigani
Convention and the Apia Convention (suspended).
