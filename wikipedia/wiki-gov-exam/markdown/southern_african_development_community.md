Inter-governmental organization

The **Southern African Development Community** (**SADC**) is an inter-
governmental organization headquartered in Gaborone, Botswana.

## Goals

The SADC's goal is to further regional socio-economic cooperation and
integration as well as political and security cooperation among 16 countries
in southern Africa. Although its primary objectives are development, economic
growth, and poverty alleviation, peacekeeping has become increasingly
important to the SADC.

## History

The origins of SADC are in the 1960s and 1970s, when the leaders of majority-
ruled countries and national liberation movements coordinated their political,
diplomatic and military struggles to bring an end to colonial and white-
minority rule in southern Africa.[_citation needed_] The immediate forerunner
of the political and security cooperation leg of today's SADC was the informal
Frontline States (FLS) grouping. It was formed in 1980.[_citation needed_]

Flag of the SADCC (1980-1992)

The Southern African Development Coordination Conference (SADCC) was the
forerunner of the socio-economic cooperation leg of today's SADC. The adoption
by nine majority-ruled southern African countries of the Lusaka declaration on
1 April 1980 paved the way for the formal establishment of SADCC in April
1980.[_citation needed_]

Membership of the FLS and SADCC sometimes differed.[_citation needed_]

SADCC was transformed into SADC on 17 August 1992, with the adoption by the
founding members of SADCC and newly independent Namibia of the Windhoek
declaration and treaty establishing SADC. The 1992 SADC provided for both
socio-economic cooperation and political and security cooperation. In reality,
the FLS was dissolved only in 1994, after South Africa's first democratic
elections. Subsequent efforts to place political and security cooperation on a
firm institutional footing under SADC's umbrella failed.[_citation needed_]

On 14 August 2001, the 1992 SADC treaty was amended. The amendment heralded
the overhaul of the structures, policies and procedures of SADC, a process
which is ongoing. One of the changes is that political and security
cooperation is institutionalised in the Organ on Politics, Defence and
Security (OPDS); one of the principal SADC bodies. It is subject to the
oversight of the organisation's supreme body, the Summit, which comprises the
heads of state or government.[_citation needed_]

The organisation holds its own multi-sport event in the form of the SADC
Games, which was first held in 2004 in Maputo. Originally planned for an
earlier date in Malawi and Lesotho, organisational issues led to abandonment
of the plan and the SADC issuing a fine of $100,000 against Malawi. The first
event in 2004 in Maputo resulted in over 1000 youths under-20 from 10
countries taking part in a sports programme including athletics, football,
netball, boxing and basketball.

In 2012, the SADC deployed peacekeepers to the Democratic Republic of Congo in
order to counter a rebel threat. The deployed troops were supplied by
Tanzania, Malawi, and South Africa.

In August 2019 SADC adopted Swahili as its fourth working language, alongside
English, French and Portuguese. Kiswahili – a lingua franca in the African
Great Lakes region, other parts of East Africa, and to a lesser degree, parts
of Southern Africa – is an official language of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda and
of the African Union.

## Protocols

SADC has 27 legally binding protocols dealing with issues such as Defence,
Development, Illicit Drug Trade, Free Trade and Movement of People.

  * Protocol on Energy (1996) – Intended to promote harmonious development of national energy policies. These development strategies set out tangible objectives for SADC and its Member States for infrastructure development in energy and its subsectors of woodfuel, petroleum and natural gas, electricity, coal, renewable energy, and energy efficiency and conservation.
  * Protocol on Gender and Development – Member states are urged to accelerate implementation efforts towards the achievements of concrete and transformative changes in the lives of women and girls in the region. H.E. President Mutharika also expressed concern on the escalating incidents of gender based violence in the region, especially those perpetrated against women and girls, and used this occasion to sign a commitment to end child marriages, as part of the AU campaign to end Child Marriages in Africa.
  * Protocol on Politics, Defence and Security Co-operation (2001) – Intended to foster regional security and defence cooperation, promote peace, political stability and conflict-management. The protocol initiated also an institutional reform of the SADC's Organ for Politics, Defence and Security (OPDS).

## SADC FTA

The SADC Free Trade Area was established in August 2008, after the
implementation of the SADC Protocol on Trade in 2000 laid the foundation for
its formation. Its original members were Botswana, Lesotho, Madagascar,
Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Eswatini, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe, with Malawi and Seychelles joining later. Of the 15 SADC member
states, only Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo are not yet
participating, however Angolan trade minister Joffre Van-Dúnen Júnior said in
Luanda that his ministry is working to create conditions for Angola's
accession to the SADC Free Trade Area in 2019. The SADC-Customs Union,
scheduled to be established by 2010 according to SADC's Regional Indicative
Strategic Development Plan (RISDP), is unlikely to become reality in the near
future. This is because the European Union's Economic Partnership Agreements
(EPA) with their inherent extra-regional freetrade regimes provided for
several SADC members more benefits than deeper regional market integration
within the framework of a SADC-Customs Union. Since these SADC countries
formed four different groupings to negotiate and implement different Economic
Partnership Agreements with the European Union, the chance to establish a
SADC-wide common external tariff as prerequisite for a regional customs union
is missed.

On Wednesday 22 October 2008, SADC joined with the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa and the East African Community to form the African Free
Trade Zone, including all members of each of the organizations. The leaders of
the three trading blocs agreed to create a single free trade zone, the African
Free Trade Zone, consisting of 26 countries with a GDP of an estimated $624bn
(£382.9bn). It is hoped the African Free Trade Zone agreement would ease
access to markets within the zone and end problems arising from the fact that
several of the member countries belong to multiple groups.

The African Free Trade Zone effective has been more than a hundred years in
the making—a trade zone spanning the whole African continent from Cape to
Cairo and envisioned by Cecil Rhodes and other British imperialists in the
1890s. The only difference is that the African Free Trade Zone is the creation
of independent African Countries. The idea is a free trade zone spanning the
whole continent from the Cape to Cairo (Cape Town in the Republic of South
Africa to Cairo in Egypt).

In addition to eliminating duplicative membership and the problem member
states also participating in other regional economic cooperation schemes and
regional political and security cooperation schemes that may compete with or
undermine each other, the African Free Trade Zone further aims to strengthen
the bloc's bargaining power when negotiating international deals.

Pursuant to the SADC goal of more integration, Botswana and Namibia signed an
agreement in February 2023 allowing citizens to travel between the two
countries using only identity cards, with passports no longer being needed.
Botswana has held talks with Zimbabwe to achieve a similar deal, and expects
to open talks with Zambia.

## Challenges facing member countries

SADC countries face many social, development, economic, trade, education,
health, diplomatic, defence, security and political challenges. Some of these
challenges cannot be tackled effectively by individual members. Cattle
diseases and organised-crime gangs know no boundaries. War in one country can
suck in its neighbours and damage their economies. The sustainable development
that trade could bring is threatened by the existence of different product
standards and tariff regimes, weak customs infrastructure and bad roads. The
socio-economic and political and security cooperation aims of SADC are equally
wide-ranging, and intended to address the various common challenges.

One significant challenge is that member states also participate in other
regional economic cooperation schemes and regional political and security
cooperation schemes that may compete with or undermine SADC's aims. For
example, South Africa and Botswana both belong to the Southern Africa Customs
Union, Zambia is a part of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa,
and Tanzania is a member of the East African Community.

According to Human Rights Watch, "SADC has been criticized for its laxity on
making human rights compliance within its member states a priority".

## Structure and decision-making procedures

The organization has six principal bodies:

  * The Summit, comprising heads of state or heads of government
  * Organ on Politics, Defense and Security
  * Council of Ministers
  * SADC Tribunal
  * SADC National Committees (SNCs)
  * Secretariat

Except for the Tribunal (based in Windhoek, Namibia), SNCs and Secretariat,
decision-making is by consensus.
