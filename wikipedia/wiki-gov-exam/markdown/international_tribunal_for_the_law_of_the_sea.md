The **International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea** (**ITLOS**) is an
intergovernmental organization created by the mandate of the Third United
Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea. It was established by the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay, Jamaica, on
December 10, 1982. The Convention entered into force on November 16, 1994, and
established an international framework for law over all ocean space, its uses
and resources. The ITLOS is one of four dispute resolution mechanisms listed
in Article 287 of the UNCLOS. Although the Tribunal was established by a
United Nations convention, it is not, as such, a United Nations agency. Even
so, it maintains close links with the United Nations and in 1997 the Tribunal
concluded an Agreement on Cooperation and Relationship between the United
Nations and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, which
establishes a mechanism for cooperation between the two institutions.

The Tribunal is based in Hamburg, Germany. The Convention also established the
International Seabed Authority, with responsibility for the regulation of
seabed mining beyond the limits of national jurisdiction, that is beyond the
limits of the territorial sea, the contiguous zone and the continental shelf.
As of July 2024, there are currently 157 signatories, 169 participant states
plus the European Union. As of December 2022[update], holdouts included the
United States and Iran.

## Composition

According to its founding statute, the Tribunal has a set of 21 judges who
serve from a variety of states parties, "according to a method that intends to
assure an equitable geographical representation".

At the request of Chile and the European Union, the Tribunal set up a special
chamber composed of five judges to deal with the _Case concerning the
Conservation and Sustainable Exploitation of Swordfish Stocks in the South-
Eastern Pacific Ocean (Chile/European Community)_.[_citation needed_]

By agreement of the parties Ghana and Ivory Coast, the Tribunal formed a
special chamber composed of five judges to deal with the _Dispute concerning
Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary between Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire in the
Atlantic Ocean (Ghana/Côte d'Ivoire)_.[_citation needed_]

By agreement of the parties Mauritius and Maldives, the Tribunal formed a
special chamber of seven permanent judges and two _ad hoc_ judges to deal with
the _Dispute concerning Delimitation of the Maritime Boundary between
Mauritius and Maldives in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius/Maldives)_.

## Seats

Disputes referred to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea or one
of its chambers can be heard in Germany or in Singapore. So far, no case has
been heard outside Germany.
