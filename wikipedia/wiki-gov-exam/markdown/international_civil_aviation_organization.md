Specialised agency of the United Nations

The **International Civil Aviation Organization** (**ICAO** /ˌaɪˈkeɪoʊ/ _eye-
KAY-oh_) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that coordinates the
principles and techniques of international air navigation, and fosters the
planning and development of international air transport to ensure safe and
orderly growth. The ICAO headquarters are located in the Quartier
international de Montréal of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

The ICAO Council adopts standards and recommended practices concerning air
navigation, its infrastructure, flight inspection, prevention of unlawful
interference, and facilitation of border-crossing procedures for international
civil aviation. ICAO defines the protocols for air accident investigation that
are followed by transport safety authorities in countries signatory to the
Convention on International Civil Aviation.

The Air Navigation Commission (ANC) is the technical body within ICAO. The
commission is composed of 19 commissioners, nominated by the ICAO's
contracting states and appointed by the ICAO Council. Commissioners serve as
independent experts, who although nominated by their states, do not serve as
state or political representatives. International Standards and Recommended
Practices are developed under the direction of the ANC through the formal
process of ICAO Panels. Once approved by the commission, standards are sent to
the council, the political body of ICAO, for consultation and coordination
with the member states before final adoption.

ICAO is distinct from other international air transport organizations,
particularly because it alone is vested with international authority (among
signatory states): other organizations include the International Air Transport
Association (IATA), a trade association representing airlines; the Civil Air
Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO), an organization for air navigation
service providers (ANSPs); and the Airports Council International, a trade
association of airport authorities. In addition there are several regional
civil aviation commissions, such as the Latin America Civil Aviation
Commission (LACAC) who focus on challenges and growth in specific regions.

## History

### 20th century

In the early 20th Century, the International Telecommunication Union met to
discuss and implement one of the first internationally agreed upon standards
relating to aviation, country-specific prefixes for aircraft callsigns. The
first convention was held in 1903 in Berlin, Germany, but no agreements were
reached among the eight countries that attended. At the second convention in
1906, also held in Berlin, twenty-seven countries attended. The third
convention, held in London in 1912, allocated the first radio callsigns for
use by aircraft. Following this, at the Paris Convention of 1919, a forerunner
to ICAO named ICAN was established, the **International Commission for Air
Navigation**. ICAN continued to operate until 1945.

The Convention on International Civil Aviation, also known as the Chicago
Convention, in Chicago, was signed by 52 countries on 7 December 1944. Under
its terms, a **Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization** was to
be established, to be replaced in turn by a permanent organization when
twenty-six countries ratified the convention. PICAO began operating on 6 June
1945, replacing ICAN. The 26th country ratified the convention on 5 March 1947
and, consequently, PICAO was disestablished on 4 April 1947 and replaced by
ICAO, which began operations the same day.[_citation needed_]

In October 1947, ICAO became an agency of the United Nations under its
Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

### 21st century

In April 2013, Qatar offered to serve as the new permanent seat of the
Organization. Qatar promised to construct a massive new headquarters for ICAO
and to cover all moving expenses, stating that Montreal "was too far from
Europe and Asia", "had cold winters", was hard to attend due to the Canadian
government's slow issuance of visas, and that the taxes imposed on ICAO by
Canada were too high. According to _The Globe and Mail_ , Qatar's invitation
was at least partly motivated by the pro-Israel foreign policy of Canadian
Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Approximately a month later, Qatar withdrew its
bid after a separate proposal to the ICAO's governing council to move the ICAO
triennial conference to Doha was defeated by a vote of 22–14.

In June 2014, the Montreal Metro station closest to the ICAO headquarters was
renamed Square-Victoria–OACI, celebrating the 70th anniversary of ICAO's
presence in Montreal.

#### Taiwan controversy

In January 2020, ICAO blocked several Twitter users, including think-tank
analysts, U.S. Congressional staff, and journalists, who mentioned Taiwan in
tweets related to ICAO. Many of the tweets were related to the COVID-19
pandemic and Taiwan's exclusion from ICAO safety and health bulletins due to
pressure from China. In response, ICAO issued a tweet stating that publishers
of "irrelevant, compromising and offensive material" would be "precluded".

Since that action, the organization has followed a policy of blocking anyone
asking about it.

The United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs harshly criticized ICAO's
perceived failure to uphold principles of fairness, inclusion, and
transparency by silencing non-disruptive opposing voices. Senator Marco Rubio
also criticized the move. The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and
legislators criticized the move, with MOFA head Jaushieh Joseph Wu tweeting in
support of those blocked.

In January 2020, Anthony Philbin, Chief of Communications for the ICAO
Secretary General, defended ICAO's actions, stating, 'We felt completely
justified in taking steps to protect the integrity of the information and
discussions that our followers reasonably expect from our feeds.' In exchanges
with the International Flight Network, Philbin refused to acknowledge the
existence of Taiwan.

On 1 February 2020, the United States Department of State issued a press
release heavily criticizing ICAO's actions, characterizing them as
"outrageous, unacceptable, and not befitting of a UN organization."

#### North Korea controversy

On May 2, 2025, the ICAO Council expressed grave concern over ongoing Global
Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) radio frequency interference in the Incheon
Flight Information Region (FIR), incidents that have persisted since October
2, 2024, and are attributed to North Korea, officially known as the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The Council emphasized that such
interference endangers international air navigation safety and violates the
principles of the Chicago Convention. It strongly urged the DPRK to adhere to
its international obligations and prevent future occurrences. Given the
severity of the situation, the Council is considering reporting the matter to
the 42nd Session of the ICAO Assembly in September 2025, as per Article 54(k)
of the Convention, and will continue to monitor developments closely.

## Statute

The 9th edition of the Convention on International Civil Aviation includes
modifications from years 1948 up to 2006. ICAO refers to its current edition
of the convention as the _Statute_ and designates it as ICAO Document 7300/9.
The convention has 19 Annexes that are listed by title in the article
Convention on International Civil Aviation.

## Membership

International Civil Aviation Organization member states

As of April 2019[update], there are 193 ICAO members, consisting of 192 of the
193 UN members (all but Liechtenstein, which lacks an international airport),
plus the Cook Islands.

Despite Liechtenstein not being a direct party to ICAO, its government
delegated Switzerland to enter into the treaty on its behalf in 1947, and the
treaty is applicable in the territory of Liechtenstein.

### Exclusion of Taiwan

The Republic of China was a founding member of ICAO. Following its retreat to
Taiwan, it was eventually replaced by the People's Republic of China as the
legal representative of China in 1971.

In 2013, Taiwan was for the first time invited to attend the ICAO Assembly, at
its 38th session, as a guest under the name of "Chinese Taipei". As of
September 2019[update], it has not been invited to participate again, due to
renewed PRC pressure.

The host government, Canada, supports Taiwan's inclusion in ICAO. Support also
comes from Canada's commercial sector with the president of the Air Transport
Association of Canada saying in 2019 that "It's about safety in aviation so
from a strictly operational and non-political point of view, I believe Taiwan
should be there."

## Council

The ICAO's council chamber in July 2013

The ICAO Council is elected by the Assembly every three years and consists of
36 members elected in three groups. The present council was elected in October
2022. The structure of the present Council is as follows:

## Air Navigation Commission

Meeting room of ICAO's Air Navigation Commission in July 2013

The Air Navigation Commission (ANC) is the ICAO Council technical executive
body in charge of 17 of the 19 Annexes to the Chicago Convention. ANC develops
and recommend ICAO minimal standards that are related to these Annexes. To
review and/or finalize the ongoing developments the commission meets for three
sessions per year. Each session normally considers a number of documents being
developments of ANC expert Panels. The ANC is composed of nineteen
commissioners nominated by ICAO States in various aviation domains. However,
legally these commissioners do not represent the interest of their State or
any particular State or region. They have to conduct independently in the
interest of the entire international civil aviation community. Additionally,
several other representatives from ICAO States and up to eight members from
the civil aviation industry may be invited to take part in ANC meetings as
observers.

## Standards

ICAO also standardizes certain functions for use in the airline industry, such
as the Aeronautical Message Handling System (AMHS). This makes it a standards
organization.

Each country should have an accessible Aeronautical Information Publication
(AIP), based on standards defined by ICAO, containing information essential to
air navigation. Countries are required to update their AIP manuals every 28
days and so provide definitive regulations, procedures and information for
each country about airspace and airports. ICAO's standards also dictate that
temporary hazards to aircraft must be regularly published using NOTAMs.

ICAO defines an International Standard Atmosphere (also known as ICAO Standard
Atmosphere), a model of the standard variation of pressure, temperature,
density, and viscosity with altitude in the Earth's atmosphere. This is useful
in calibrating instruments and designing aircraft. The standardized pressure
is also used in calibrating instruments in-flight, particularly above the
transition altitude.

ICAO is active in infrastructure management, including communication,
navigation and surveillance / air traffic management (CNS/ATM) systems, which
employ digital technologies (like satellite systems with various levels of
automation) in order to maintain a seamless global air traffic management
system.

### Passport standards

ICAO has published standards for machine-readable passports. Machine-readable
passports have an area where some of the information otherwise written in
textual form is also written as strings of alphanumeric characters, printed in
a manner suitable for optical character recognition, which enables border
controllers and other law enforcement agents to process such passports more
quickly without having to enter the information manually into a computer.

ICAO's technical standard for machine-readable passports is contained in
Document 9303 _Machine Readable Travel Documents_.

A more recent standard covers biometric passports. These contain biometrics to
authenticate the identity of travellers. The passport's critical information
is stored on a tiny RFID computer chip, much like information stored on smart
cards. Like some smart cards, the passport book design calls for an embedded
contactless chip that is able to hold digital signature data to ensure the
integrity of the passport and the biometric data.

### Aerodrome reference code

Aerodrome reference code  Number | Field length

## Registered codes

Both ICAO and IATA have their own airport and airline code systems.

### Airport codes

ICAO uses 4-letter airport codes (vs. IATA's 3-letter codes). The ICAO code is
based on the region and country of the airport—for example, Charles de Gaulle
Airport has an ICAO code of LFPG, where _L_ indicates Southern Europe, _F_ ,
France, _PG_ , Paris de Gaulle, while Orly Airport has the code LFPO (the 3rd
letter sometimes refers to the particular flight information region (FIR) or
the last two may be arbitrary). In most parts of the world, ICAO and IATA
codes are unrelated; for example, Charles de Gaulle Airport has an IATA code
of CDG. However, the location prefix for the continental United States is _K_
, and ICAO codes are usually the IATA code with this prefix. For example, the
ICAO code for Los Angeles International Airport is KLAX. Canada follows a
similar pattern, where a prefix of _C_ is usually added to an IATA code to
create the ICAO code. For example, Calgary International Airport is YYC or
CYYC. (In contrast, airports in Hawaii are in the Pacific region and so have
ICAO codes that start with _PH_ ; Kona International Airport's code is PHKO.
Similarly, airports in Alaska have ICAO codes that start with _PA_. Merrill
Field, for instance is PAMR.) Not all airports are assigned codes in both
systems; for example, airports that do not have airline service do not need an
IATA code.

### Airline codes

ICAO also assigns three-letter airline codes versus the more-familiar two-
letter IATA codes—for example, _UAL_ vs. _UA_ for United Airlines. ICAO also
provides telephony designators to aircraft operators worldwide, a one- or two-
word designator used on the radio, usually, but not always, similar to the
aircraft operator name. For example, the identifier for Japan Airlines
International is _JAL_ and the designator is _Japan Air_ , but Aer Lingus is
_EIN_ and _Shamrock_. Thus, a Japan Airlines flight numbered 111 would be
written as "JAL111" and pronounced "Japan Air One One One" on the radio, while
a similarly numbered Aer Lingus would be written as "EIN111" and pronounced
"Shamrock One One One". In the US, FAA practices require the digits of the
flight number to be spoken in group format ("Japan Air One Eleven" in the
above example) while individual digits are used for the aircraft tail number
used for unscheduled civil flights.

### Aircraft registrations

ICAO maintains the standards for aircraft registration, including the
alphanumeric codes that identify the country of registration.

### Aircraft type designators

ICAO is also responsible for issuing two to four character alphanumeric
aircraft type designators for those aircraft types which are most commonly
provided with air traffic service. These codes provide an abbreviated aircraft
type identification, typically used in flight plans. For example, the Boeing
747-100, -200 and -300 are given the type designators _B741_ , _B742_ and
_B743_ respectively.

## International System of Units

Since 2010, ICAO recommends a unification of units of measurement within
aviation based on the International System of Units (SI), using:

  * kilometres per hour (km/h) for speed during travel.
  * metres per second (m/s) for wind speed during landing.
  * kilometres (km) for distance.
  * metres (m) for elevation.

Non-SI units have been permitted for temporary use since 1979, but a
termination date has not yet been established, which would complete
metrication of worldwide aviation, and the following units are still in
widespread use within commercial aviation:

  * knots (kn or kt) for speed.
  * nautical mile (NM) for distance.
  * foot (ft) for elevation.

inches of mercury are used in Japan and North America to measure pressure,
although sometimes METAR at Japanese airports show only hPa.

Aviation in Russia and China currently use km/h for reporting airspeed, and
many present-day European glider planes also indicate airspeed in kilometres
per hour.[_citation needed_] China and North Korea use metres for reporting
altitude when communicating with pilots. Russia also formerly used metres
exclusively for reporting altitude, but in 2011 changed to feet for high
altitude flight. From February 2017, Russian airspace started transitioning to
reporting altitude in feet only. Runway lengths are now commonly given in
metres worldwide, except in North America where feet are commonly used.

The following table summarizes units commonly used in flight and ground
operations and their recommended replacement. A full list of recommended units
can be found in annex 5 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation.

Table of units commonly used in aviation  Measurement  | Recommended  | Current de facto  | Comment   
---|---|---|---  
Airspeed and ground speed | km/h | kn or kt  | Mach is sometimes instead used for high altitude flight.   
Distance (ground)  | km | nmi | Distance in km has widespread use in European gliders.   
Flight level† | m | ft | Metres are used by China, Mongolia, North Korea, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, and formerly Russia. From 2017, Russian airspace has transitioned from metres to feet.   
Runway length | m | m or ft | Feet are still used for runway lengths in North America.   
Wind speed | m/s | kn or kt  | Until 2010 ICAO recommended km/h for reporting wind speed on runways. Metres per second is used by Russian and Chinese airports.   
Rate of climb | m/s | ft/min, kn, m/s | Lift and sink rate is measured using a variometer.   
Temperature | °C | °C | Celsius is used for aviation weather reporting globally. Fahrenheit (°F) may be used for displaying, controlling, and documenting system temperatures (HVAC, engine) on older North American aircraft.   
Liquid precipitation | mm | in |   
Atmospheric pressure | hPa | inHg, mbar, hPa | Hectopascals are mostly used in aviation worldwide, while inches of mercury are used in Japan and North America. One hectopascal is equal to one millibar.   
Visibility | m | ft, mi, m | Reported in metres for most of the world. Visibility over 5000 m may be given in kilometres. Canadian, American, and Mexican airports use statute miles, or feet when reporting laser measurements.   
Cloud height | m | ft |   
Time | UTC | UTC |   
Tank capacity  | L | kg, lb, UK gallon, US gallon, L | Used for fuel tank capacity of an aircraft. Unit varies depending on the gauges fitted to the aircraft. The most common current unit is kilograms.[_citation needed_]  
Volume  | m3 | m3 | Used for general volume capacity.   
Mass  | kg | lb, tonne, long ton, short ton, kg | Used for cargo capacity, fuel capacity, gross mass, payload. Tonne may also be used for gross mass and payload. Tons are often used informally during flight planning to gauge approximate weights. Ton then usually either refers to the tonne, or the long ton or short ton which differ from the tonne by about 2% and 10% respectively.   
Attitude | deg | Measured with an attitude indicator, and are always presented in degrees. (Sensors, data and calculations may however use a mix of degrees and radians, as many scientists and engineers prefer to work with radians.)   
Turn and slip | deg/s, min/tr | A common turn rate for commercial aircraft is 3 degrees per second, which is often translated to (the inverse unit) 2 minutes per turn.   
Heading | compass points | Measured with a heading indicator.   
  
† Altitude, elevation, height.

---|---  
  
Emissions from international aviation are specifically excluded from the
targets agreed under the Kyoto Protocol. Instead, the Protocol invites
developed countries to pursue the limitation or reduction of emissions through
the International Civil Aviation Organization. ICAO's environmental committee
continues to consider the potential for using market-based measures such as
trading and charging, but this work is unlikely to lead to global action. It
is currently developing guidance for states who wish to include aviation in an
emissions trading scheme (ETS) to meet their Kyoto commitments, and for
airlines who wish to participate voluntarily in a trading scheme.[_citation
needed_]

Emissions from domestic aviation are included within the Kyoto targets agreed
by countries. This has led to some national policies such as fuel and emission
taxes for domestic air travel in the Netherlands and Norway, respectively.
Although some countries tax the fuel used by domestic aviation, there is no
duty on kerosene used on international flights.

ICAO is currently opposed to the inclusion of aviation in the European Union
Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). The EU, however, is pressing ahead with its
plans to include aviation.[_citation needed_]

ICAO has been called "flawed and biased in favour of the industry" by Jo
Dardenne, the manager for aviation at Transport & Environment.

### Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation

On 6 October 2016, the ICAO finalized an agreement among its 191 member
nations to address the more than 1000 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted
annually by international passenger and cargo flights. The agreement will use
an offsetting scheme called CORSIA (the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme
for International Aviation) under which forestry and other carbon-reducing
activities are directly funded, amounting to about 2% of annual revenues for
the sector. Rules against 'double counting' should ensure that existing forest
protection efforts are not recycled. The scheme did not take effect until 2021
and will be voluntary until 2027, but many countries, including the US and
China, have promised to begin at its 2020 inception date. Under the agreement,
the global aviation emissions target is a 50% reduction by 2050 relative to
2005. NGO reaction to the deal was mixed.

The agreement has critics. It is not aligned with the 2015 Paris climate
agreement, which set the objective of restricting global warming to 1.5 to 2
°C. A late draft of the agreement would have required the air transport
industry to assess its share of global carbon budgeting to meet that
objective, but the text was removed in the agreed version. CORSIA will
regulate only about 25 percent of aviation's international emissions, since it
grandfathers all emissions below the 2020 level, allowing unregulated growth
until then. Only 65 nations will participate in the initial voluntary period,
not including significant emitters Russia, India and perhaps Brazil. The
agreement does not cover domestic emissions, which are 40% of the global
industry's overall emissions. One observer of the ICAO convention made this
summary:

> Airline claims that flying will now be green are a myth. Taking a plane is
> the fastest and cheapest way to fry the planet and this deal won't reduce
> demand for jet fuel one drop. Instead offsetting aims to cut emissions in
> other industries,

although another critic called it "a timid step in the right direction."

ICAO has expressed strong opposition to 2025 proposals from various UN bodies
and international organizations, including the International Monetary Fund,
suggesting new taxes or levies on international aviation to fund global
climate initiatives. ICAO contends that such measures could undermine CORSIA,
emphasizing that CORSIA is the sole global framework for addressing
international aviation emissions and warning that additional levies could
disrupt its implementation and the broader goal of sustainable aviation
development. While acknowledging the need for increased climate finance, ICAO
urged stakeholders to support existing mechanisms like CORSIA rather than
introducing potentially conflicting financial measures.

### Air quality

Emissions limits for aircraft engines are defined by the Annex 16, Volume 2 of
the ICAO Technology Standards, they include standards for hydrocarbons, carbon
monoxide, NOx, smoke and particulate matter for local air quality near
airports, below 3,000 ft (910 m). The first ICAO emissions regulation was
adopted in 1981, and more stringent NOx standards were subsequently adopted:
CAEP/2 in 1993, CAEP/4 in 1999, CAEP/6 in 2005 and CAEP/8 in 2011. Higher
bypass ratios, lean burn and Rich Quick Quench Lean combustor design can
reduce NOx emissions.

## Investigations of air disasters

Most air accident investigations are carried out by an agency of a country
that is associated in some way with the accident. For example, the Air
Accidents Investigation Branch conducts accident investigations on behalf of
the British Government. ICAO has conducted four investigations involving air
disasters, of which two were passenger airliners shot down while in
international flight over hostile territory.

  1. Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114 which was shot down on 21 February 1973 by Israeli F-4 jets over the Sinai Peninsula during a period of tension that led to the Arab-Israeli Yom Kippur War killing 108 people.
  2. Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which was shot down on 1 September 1983 by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor near Moneron Island just west of Sakhalin Island during a period of heightened Cold War tension killing all 269 people on board including U.S. Representative Larry McDonald.
  3. UTA Flight 772, which was destroyed by a bomb on 19 September 1989 above the Sahara Desert in Niger, en route from N'Djamena, Chad, to Paris, France. The explosion caused the aircraft to break up, killing all 156 passengers and 15 crew members, including the wife of U.S. Ambassador Robert L. Pugh. Investigators determined that a bomb placed in the cargo hold by Chadian rebels backed by Libya was responsible for the explosion. A French court convicted _in absentia_ six Libyans of planning and implementing the attack.
  4. The 1996 shootdown of Brothers to the Rescue aircraft on 24 February 1996, when two civilian aircraft operating north of Cuba were shot down by two jets of the Cuban Air Force. The Cuban military alleged that aircraft operated by the group Brothers to the Rescue had scattered propaganda leaflets onto Cuba prior to the incident, and issued orders that such aircraft be shot down. All four crew members aboard the two aircraft were killed, whilst a third aircraft managed to escape and return to the American mainland.

## Drone regulations and registration

ICAO is looking at having a singular ledger for drone registration to help law
enforcement globally. Currently, ICAO is responsible for creating drone
regulations across the globe, and it is expected that it will only maintain
the registry. This activity is seen as a forerunner to global regulations on
flying drones under the auspices of the ICAO.

ICAO currently maintains the 'UAS Regulation Portal' for various countries to
list their country's UAS regulations and also review the best practices from
across the globe.
