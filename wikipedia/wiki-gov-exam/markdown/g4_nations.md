Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan in the UN

The **G4 nations,** comprising Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, are four
countries which support each other's bids for permanent seats on the United
Nations Security Council. Unlike the G7, where the common denominator is the
economy and long-term political motives, the G4's primary aim is the permanent
member seats on the Security Council. Each of these four countries have
figured among the elected non-permanent members of the council since the UN's
establishment. Their economic, political and military influence has grown
significantly in the last decades, reaching a scope comparable to the
permanent members (P5). However, the G4's bids are often opposed by the
Uniting for Consensus movement led by Italy, and particularly their economic
competitors or political rivals.

## Background

The UN currently has five permanent members with veto power in the Security
Council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States –
comprising the victors of World War II. The G4 nations are regularly elected
to two-year terms on the Security Council as non-permanent members by their
respective regional groups: in the 24-year period from 1987 to 2010, Brazil
and Japan were elected for five terms each, Germany for four terms (one term
as West Germany and three terms as unified Germany) and India for eight terms.
Cumulatively, the G4 has spent 64 years on the Security Council since the UN's
inception, with each country serving at least a decade.

## Opinions

### Support

The United Kingdom and France have backed the G4's bid for permanent seats on
the United Nations Security Council. Japan has received support from the
United States and the United Kingdom.

All the permanent members of P5 have supported India's bids for permanent seat
on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), but China has previously
implied that it is only ready to support India's bid for a permanent seat on
United Nations Security Council if India does not associate its bid with
Japan.

The United States has sent strong indications to Brazil that it is willing to
support its membership, albeit without a veto. The Council on Foreign
Relations recommended that the U.S. government fully endorse the inclusion of
Brazil as a permanent member of the Security Council. Brazil has received
backing from three of the current permanent members, namely France, Russia,
and the United Kingdom.

In the final document of the 2019 BRICS summit, China and Russia say they
"reiterate the importance of a comprehensive Security Council reform" and
"support Brazil and India's aspiration for more relevant UN roles".

As stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov at the Raisina
Dialogue in New Delhi in January 2020: "I would say the Security Council's
main shortcoming is the under-representation of developing countries. We
reiterate our position that India and Brazil absolutely deserve to be on the
council together with an African candidate, our position is that the purpose
of the reform is to make sure that the developing countries enjoy a better
treatment in the central organ of the United Nations".

### Opposition

There has been discontent among the present permanent members regarding the
inclusion of controversial nations or countries not supported by them. For
instance, Japan's bid is opposed by China, Russia, North Korea and South
Korea.[_citation needed_]

Under the leadership of Spain[_citation needed_] and Italy, countries that
strongly oppose the G4 countries' bids have formed the Uniting for Consensus
movement, composed mainly of regional powers that oppose the rise of some
nearby country to permanent member status. Uniting for Consensus supports
expanding the number of non-permanent security council members and restricting
the usage of the veto. The bloc argues that adding more permanent seats to the
security council only benefits the nations that gain those seats, and believes
that an expansion of the non-permanent membership will make the UNSC both more
flexible and more democratic.

In Latin America countries, Colombia,[_citation needed_] Mexico[_citation
needed_] and Argentina opposes a seat for Brazil. In Asia, Pakistan opposes
India's bid.

Another counter-proposal, the Ezulwini Consensus, was presented by the African
Union, calling for the addition of five new non-permanent seats and two new
permanent seats to be allocated to African nations, in response to a lack of
African representation on the Security Council.

## Activity

The G4 and P5 members as a future reformed UNSC Meeting of G4 leaders
(September 26, 2015)

The G4 suggested that two African nations, in addition to themselves, be
included in the enlarged UNSC. In several conferences during the summer of
2005, African Union was unable to agree on two nominees: Egypt, Nigeria and
South Africa all lay claim to a permanent African UNSC seat.

A UN General Assembly in September 2005 marked the 60th anniversary of the UN
and the members were to decide on a number of necessary reforms—including the
enlarged Security Council. However the unwillingness to find a negotiable
position stopped even the most urgent reforms; the September 2005 General
Assembly was a setback for the UN.[_citation needed_]

The G4 retain their goal of permanent UNSC membership for all four nations
(plus two African nations). In January 2006, Japan announced it would not
support putting the G4 resolution back on the table, not to interfere with any
effort by the African Union to unite behind a single plan. And meanwhile,
Japan's continuing relations with the G4 were not mutually exclusive. G4
issued a joint statement on 12 February 2011, in which their foreign ministers
agreed to seek concrete outcome in the current session of the UN General
Assembly.[_citation needed_]

In September 2015, Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, invited the
leaders of the G4 for a summit following the adoption of UN General Assembly
Decision 69/560 by consensus, which moved forward for the first time. In 2017,
it was reported that the G4 nations were willing to temporarily forgo veto
power if granted a permanent UNSC seat.

In September 2019, in a joint press statement during the 74th session of the
United Nations General Assembly, the G4 ministers reiterated their strong
commitment to an early and comprehensive reform of the UNSC. Bearing in mind
that in 2020 the United Nations would celebrate its 75th anniversary, the G4
ministers also expressed their firm hope that the current session of the
General Assembly would pave the way for finally moving on the call for an
‘early reform’ of the Security Council and underscored their steadfast support
for Africa's representation in both the permanent and non-permanent categories
of membership of a future reform.

In September 2023, in a joint press statement during the 78th session of the
United Nations General Assembly, the foreign ministers of G4, joined to
discuss the state of play of the negotiations for the reform of the UNSC, and
reiterated that the expansion of the Security Council is essential to make the
body more representative, legitimate, effective and efficient, adding that
Africa needs to be represented in both the permanent and non-permanent
categories of membership of a reformed and expanded Council.
