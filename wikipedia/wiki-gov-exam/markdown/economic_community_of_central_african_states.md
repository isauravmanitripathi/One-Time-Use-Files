The **Economic Community of Central African States** (**ECCAS** ; French:
_Communauté Économique des États de l'Afrique Centrale_ , CEEAC; Spanish:
_Comunidad Económica de los Estados de África Central_ , CEEAC; Portuguese:
_Comunidade Económica dos Estados da África Central_ , CEEAC) is an Economic
Community of the African Union for promotion of regional economic co-operation
in Central Africa. It "aims to achieve collective autonomy, raise the standard
of living of its populations and maintain economic stability through
harmonious cooperation".

## History

### Foundation

At a summit meeting in December 1981, the leaders of the Customs and Economic
Union of Central Africa (French acronym UDEAC) agreed in principle to form a
wider economic community of Central African states. ECCAS was established on
18 October 1983 by the UDEAC members, São Tomé and Príncipe and the members of
the Economic Community of the Great Lakes States (CEPGL established in 1976 by
the DR Congo, Burundi and Rwanda). Angola remained an observer until 1999,
when it became a full member.

ECCAS began functioning in 1985, but was inactive for several years because of
financial difficulties (non-payment of membership fees by the member states)
and the conflict in the Great Lakes area. The war in the DR Congo was
particularly divisive, as Rwanda and Angola fought on opposing sides. ECCAS
has been designated a pillar of the African Economic Community (AEC), but
formal contact between the AEC and ECCAS was only established in October 1999
due to the inactivity of ECCAS since 1992 (ECCAS signed the Protocol on
Relations between the AEC and the regional blocs (RECs) in October 1999). The
AEC again confirmed the importance of ECCAS as the major economic community in
Central Africa at the third preparatory meeting of its Economic and Social
Council (ECOSOC) in June 1999.

Presided over by President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, the summit was held in
Libreville on 6 February 1998. The Heads of State and Government present at
the summit committed themselves to the resurrection of the organisation. The
Prime Minister of Angola also indicated that his country would become a fully
fledged member. The summit approved a budget of 10 million French francs for
1998 and requested the Secretariat to:

  * Obtain assistance from UNECA to evaluate the operational activities of the secretariat; to evaluate the contributions due by member states; and the salaries and salary structures of employees of the secretariat
  * Convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Ministers as soon as possible to evaluate the recommendations of UNECA; the Council should then draw up proposals for a new administrative structure for the secretariat and revised contributions due by each member state.

The summit also requested countries in the region to find lasting and peaceful
solutions to their political problems. The chairman also appealed to member
countries to support the complete lifting of the embargo placed on his
country. During the inauguration of President Bongo of Gabon on 21 January
1999, a mini-summit of ECCAS leaders was held. The leaders discussed problems
concerning the functioning of ECCAS and the creation of a third Deputy
Secretary-General post, designated for Angola. Angola formally joined the
Community during this summit.

### Recent events

The 10th Ordinary Session of Heads of State and Government took place in
Malabo in June 2002. This Summit decided to adopt a protocol on the
establishment of a Network of Parliamentarians of Central Africa (REPAC) and
to adopt the standing orders of the Council for Peace and Security in Central
Africa (COPAX), including the Defence and Security Commission (CDS),
Multinational Force of Central Africa (FOMAC) and the Early Warning Mechanism
of Central Africa (MARAC). Rwanda was also officially welcomed upon its return
as a full member of ECCAS.

On January 24, 2003, the European Union (EU) concluded a financial agreement
with ECCAS and CEMAC, conditional on ECCAS and CEMAC merging into one
organization, with ECCAS taking responsibility for the peace and security of
the sub-region through its security pact COPAX. CEMAC is not one of the
pillars of the African Economic Community, but its members are associated with
it through Economic Community of Central African States. The EU had multiple
peacekeeping missions in the DR Congo: Operation Artemis (June to September
2003), EUPOL Kinshasa (from October 2003) and EUSEC DR Congo (from May 2005).

The 11th Ordinary Session of Heads of State and Government in Brazzaville
during January 2004 welcomed the fact that the Protocol Relating to the
Establishment of a Council for Peace and Security in Central Africa (COPAX)
had received the required number of ratifications to enter into force. The
Summit also adopted a declaration on the implementation of NEPAD in Central
Africa as well as a declaration on gender equality.

On September 23, 2009, pursuant to Presidential Determination 2009-26 and as
published in the Federal Register / Vol. 74, No. 183 (Presidential Documents
48363) ECCAS was made eligible under the U.S. Arms Export Control Act for the
furnishing of defense articles and defense services. This makes the ECCAS
organization and (theoretically) the countries under their charter eligible
for U.S. Foreign Military Sales Program (i.e. government to government sales
and assistance) pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act and for other such
U.S. assistance as directed by a USG contract to U.S. industry for such
support pursuant to the (ITAR)[1].

In 2007, Rwanda decided to leave the organisation in order to remove overlap
in its membership in regional trade blocks and so that it could better focus
on its membership in the EAC and COMESA. Rwanda was a founding member of the
organisation and had been a part of it since 18 October 1981. It subsequently
rejoined ECCAS in 2016. On 1 September 2020, Gilberto Da Piedade Verissimo of
Angola was appointed President of the ECCAS Commission with Francisca
Tatchouop Belobe as vice-President.

In response to the 2023 Gabonese coup d'état, the ECCAS condemned the military
use of force and asked for restoration of constitutional order. It also
suspended Gabon's membership in the bloc on 5 September and moved its
headquarters from Libreville to Malabo, Equatorial Guinea.

On 7 June 2025, Rwanda announced its departure from the ECCAS, citing the
bloc's "instrumentalisation" by the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

## Economic integration

### Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa

The Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (or CEMAC from its name
in French) is an organization established by Cameroon, Central African
Republic, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon to promote
economic integration among countries that share a common currency, the West
African CFA franc.

## Peace and security activities

Central African states adopted a pact of non-aggression at the end of the
fifth meeting of the UN Consultative Committee on Security in Central Africa
held in Yaoundé, Cameroon. The pact, adopted on 9 September 1994, was arrived
at after five days of meeting and discussions between military experts and
ministers of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Equatorial
Guinea, Gabon and São Tomé and Príncipe. At a summit conference of the United
Nations Standing Advisory Committee on Security Questions in Central Africa
which took place in Yaoundé on 25–26 February 1999, member states decided to
create an organisation for the promotion, maintenance and consolidation of
peace and security in Central Africa, which would be called the Council for
Peace and Security in Central Africa (COPAX). The COPAX Protocol has now
entered into force.

### Technical organs of the COPAX council

  * The Central African Early-Warning System (MARAC), which collects and analyses data for the early detection and prevention of crises.
  * The Defence and Security Commission (CDS), which is the meeting of chiefs of staff of national armies and commanders-in-chief of police and gendarmerie forces from the different member states. Its role is to plan, organize and provide advice to the decision-making bodies of the community in order to initiate military operations if needed.
  * The Multinational Force of Central Africa (FOMAC), which is a non-permanent force consisting of military contingents from member states, whose purpose is to accomplish missions of peace, security and humanitarian relief.

The standing orders for COPAX, including those of CDS, MARAC and FOMAC were
adopted in June 2002 at the 10th Ordinary Summit in Malabo.

In January 2000, Gabon hosted a regional peacekeeping exercise "Gabon 2000"
with the objective of increasing the capacity of ECCAS states in the field of
peacekeeping and conflict prevention and management. This exercise represented
a direct application of the French RECAMP-concept (reinforcement of African
peacekeeping capacities).

Extraordinary Summits of both ECCAS and CEMAC took place in Libreville on 23
June 2000. Foreign ministers from 10 Central African states met in the
Democratic Republic of Congo on 16 and 17 August 2001 to discuss security in
their war-torn region. The meeting was sponsored by the United Nations, and
only Rwanda declined to attend.

A meeting of Defence Chiefs of Staff was held in Brazzaville in October 2003,
at which it was decided that a brigade-size peacekeeping force would be
created in order to intervene in unstable Central African areas. This could
then form one of the African Union's five planned brigades of the African
Standby Force, one brigade for each region (North, West, Central, East and
Southern Africa). The meeting recommended that military planners from each of
the ECCAS states form a group to work out the details for the force. They also
suggested the establishment of a joint peacekeeping training centre and
military exercises every two years. The first of these is to take place in
Chad.

### MICOPAX

The Mission for the consolidation of peace in Central African Republic
(MICOPAX) is a peace operation in the Central African Republic led by the
ECCAS. It is involved in the Central African Republic Bush War and 2012–2013
Central African Republic conflict.
