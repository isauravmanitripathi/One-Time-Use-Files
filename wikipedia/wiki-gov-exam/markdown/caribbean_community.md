Regional intergovernmental organisation

The **Caribbean Community** (abbreviated as **CARICOM** or **CC**) is an
intergovernmental organisation that is a political and economic union of 15
member states (14 nation-states and one dependency) and five associated
members throughout the Americas, the Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean. It has the
primary objective to promote economic integration and cooperation among its
members, ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared, and
coordinate foreign policy. The organisation was established in 1973, by its
four founding members signing the Treaty of Chaguaramas.

The secretariat headquarters is in Georgetown, Guyana. CARICOM has been
granted the official United Nations General Assembly observer status.

## History

CARICOM, originally The Caribbean Community and Common Market, was established
by the Treaty of Chaguaramas which took effect on 1 August 1973. Founding
states were Barbados, Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago.

The Caribbean Community superseded the 1965–1972 Caribbean Free Trade
Association organised to provide a continued economic linkage between the
English-speaking countries of the Caribbean after the dissolution of the West
Indies Federation, which lasted from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962.

A revised Treaty of Chaguaramas established _The Caribbean Community including
the CARICOM Single Market and Economy_ and was signed by the CARICOM Heads of
Government of the Caribbean Community on 5 July 2001 at their Twenty-Second
Meeting of the Conference in Nassau, The Bahamas. The revised treaty cleared
the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the Caribbean
(CARICOM) Single Market and Economy.

Haiti's membership in CARICOM remained effectively suspended from 29 February
2004 through early June 2006 following the 2004 Haitian coup d'état and the
removal of Jean-Bertrand Aristide from the presidency. CARICOM announced that
no democratically elected government in CARICOM should have its leader
deposed. The fourteen other heads of government sought to have Aristide fly
from Africa to Jamaica and share his account of events with them, which
infuriated the interim Haitian prime minister, Gérard Latortue, who announced
he would take steps to take Haiti out of CARICOM. CARICOM thus voted on
suspending the participation of Haitian officials from the councils of
CARICOM. Following the presidential election of René Préval, Haitian officials
were readmitted and Préval himself gave the opening address at the CARICOM
Council of Ministers meeting in July.

Since 2013 the CARICOM-bloc and with the Dominican Republic have been tied to
the European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements signed in 2008 known
as CARIFORUM. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and
CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Under Article 234 of
the agreement, the European Court of Justice handles dispute resolution
between CARIFORUM and European Union states.

## Agenda and goals

CARICOM was established by the English-speaking countries of the Caribbean and
currently includes all the independent Anglophone island countries plus
Belize, Guyana, Montserrat and Suriname, as well as all other British
Caribbean territories and Bermuda as associate members. English was its sole
working language into the 1990s. The organisation became multilingual with the
addition of Dutch and Sranan Tongo-speaking Suriname in 1995 and the French
and Haitian Creole-speaking Haiti in 2002. Furthermore, it added Spanish as
the fourth official language in 2003. In July 2012, CARICOM announced they
considered making French and Dutch official languages. In 2001, the Conference
of Heads of Governments signed a revised Treaty of Chaguaramas that cleared
the way to transform the idea of a common market CARICOM into the CARICOM
Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty establishes and
implements the Caribbean Court of Justice. Its primary activities involve:

  * Coordinating economic policies and development planning.
  * Devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction.
  * Operating as a regional single market for many of its members (Caricom Single Market).
  * Handling regional trade disputes.

### Association of Caribbean States

CARICOM was instrumental in the formation of the Association of Caribbean
States (ACS) on 24 July 1994. The original idea for the Association came from
a recommendation of the West Indian Commission, established in 1989 by the
CARICOM heads of state and government. The Commission advocated both deepening
the integration process (through the CARICOM Single Market and Economy) and
complementing it through a separate regional organisation encompassing all
states in the Caribbean.

CARICOM accepted the commission's recommendations and opened dialogue with
other Caribbean states, the Central American states and the Latin American
nations of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico which border the Caribbean, for
consultation on the proposals of the West Indian Commission.

At an October 1993 summit, the heads of state and government of CARICOM and
the presidents of the then-Group of Three (Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela)
formally decided to create an association grouping all states of the Caribbean
basin. A work schedule for its formation was adopted. The aim was to create
the association in less than a year, an objective which was achieved with the
formal creation of the ACS.

### Community of Latin American and Caribbean States

CARICOM was also involved in the formation of the Community of Latin American
and Caribbean States (CELAC) on 3 December 2010. The idea for CELAC originated
at the Rio Group–Caribbean Community Unity Summit on 23 February 2010 in
Mexico. This act caters to the integration of the Americas process,
complimenting well-established initiatives of the Organization of American
States.

### European Union: Economic Partnership Agreements

Since 2013, the CARICOM-bloc and the Dominican Republic have been tied to the
European Union via an Economic Partnership Agreements known as CARIFORUM
signed in 2008. The treaty grants all members of the European Union and
CARIFORUM equal rights in terms of trade and investment. Within the agreement
under Article 234, the European Court of Justice also carries dispute
resolution mechanisms between CARIFORUM and the states of the European Union.

### OHADAC Project

In May 2016, Caricom's court of original jurisdiction, the CCJ, signed a
memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the ACP Legal Association based in
Guadeloupe recognising and supporting the goals of implementing a harmonised
business law framework in the Caribbean through ACP Legal Association's OHADAC
Project.

OHADAC is the acronym for the French "Organisation pour l'Harmonisation du
Droit des Affaires en les Caraïbes", which translates into English as
"Organisation for the Harmonisation of Business Law in the Caribbean". The
OHADAC Project takes inspiration from a similar organisation in Africa and
aims to enhance economic integration across the entire Caribbean and
facilitate increased trade and international investment through unified laws
and alternative dispute resolution methods.

## Member states

associate members will be. The observers are states which engage in at least
one of CARICOM's technical committees.[_page needed_]

Thousands of Caricom nationals live within other member states of the
Community.

An estimated 30,000 Jamaicans legally reside in other CARICOM member states,
mainly in The Bahamas (6,200), Antigua & Barbuda (estimated 12,000), Barbados
and Trinidad & Tobago). Also, an estimated 150 Jamaicans live and work in
Montserrat. A 21 November 2013 estimated put 16,958 Jamaicans residing
illegally in Trinidad & Tobago, as according to the records of the Office of
the Chief Immigration Officer, their entry certificates would have since
expired. By October 2014, the estimated Jamaicans residing illegally in
Trinidad and Tobago was 19,000 along with an estimated 7,169 Barbadians and
25,884 Guyanese residing illegally. An estimated 8,000 Trinidadians and
Tobagonians live in Jamaica.

Exclusive Economic Zones of the member states of the CARICOM. Considering
them, the total area reaches the 2 300 297 km2.

Barbados hosts a large diaspora population of Guyanese, of whom (in 2005)
5,032 lived there permanently as citizens, permanent residents, immigrants
(with immigrant status) and Caricom skilled nationals; 3,200 were residing in
Barbados temporarily under work permits, as students, or with "reside and
work" status. A further 2,000–3,000 Guyanese were estimated to be living
illegally in Barbados at the time. Migration between Barbados and Guyana has
deep roots, going back over 150 years, with the most intense period of
Barbadian migration to then-British Guiana occurring between 1863 and 1886,
although as late as the 1920s and 1930s Barbadians were still leaving Barbados
for British Guiana.

Migration between Guyana and Suriname also goes back a number of years. An
estimated 50,000 Guyanese had migrated to Suriname by 1986 In 1987 an
estimated 30–40,000 Guyanese were in Suriname. Many Guyanese left Suriname in
the 1970s and 1980s, either voluntarily or by expulsion. Citing a national
security concern, over 5,000 were expelled in January 1985 alone. In the
instability Suriname experienced following independence, both coups and civil
war. In 2013, an estimated 11,530 Guyanese had emigrated to Suriname and 4,662
Surinamese to Guyana.

### Relationship with Cuba

In 2017, the Republic of Cuba and CARICOM signed the "CARICOM-Cuba Trade and
Economic Cooperation Agreement" to facilitate closer trade ties. In December
2022, President of Cuba Miguel Díaz-Canel met in Bridgetown, Barbados with the
Heads of State and Government of CARICOM. On the occasion of the 8th CARICOM-
Cuba Summit to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of establishing diplomatic
relations with the independent States of CARICOM and Cuba and the 20th
Anniversary of CARICOM-Cuba Day. Cuba also accepted CARICOM's offer to deepen
bilateral cooperation and to join robust discussions in the bloc's regional
'Joint Ministerial Taskforce on Food production and Security'.

## Symbols

### Standard

The flag of the Caribbean Community was chosen and approved in November 1983
at the Conference of Heads of Government Meeting in Port of Spain, Trinidad.
The original design by the firm of WINART Studies in Georgetown, Guyana was
substantially modified at the July 1983 Meeting of the Conference of Heads of
Government. The flag was first flown on 4 July 1984 in Nassau, The Bahamas at
the fifth Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government.

The flag features a blue background, but the upper part is a light blue
representing sky and the lower, a darker blue representing the Caribbean Sea.
The yellow circle in the centre represents the sun on which is printed in
black the logo of the Caribbean Community, two interlocking Cs. The two Cs are
in the form of broken links in a chain, symbolising both unity and a break
with the colonial past. The narrow ring of green around the sun represents the
vegetation of the region.

### Song

For CARICOM's 40th anniversary, a competition to compose an official song or
anthem for CARICOM was launched in April 2013 to promote choosing a song that
promoted unity and inspired CARICOM identity and pride. A regional panel of
judges comprising independent experts in music was nominated by member states
and the CARICOM Secretariat. Three rounds of competition condensed 63 entries
to a final three, from which judges chose _Celebrating CARICOM_ by Michele
Henderson of Dominica in March 2014. Henderson won a US$10,000 prize. Her song
was produced by her husband, Roland Delsol Jr., and arranged by Earlson
Matthew. It also featured Michael Ferrol on drums and choral input from the
St. Alphonsus Choir. It was re-produced for CARICOM by Carl Beaver Henderson
of Trinidad and Tobago.

A second-place entry titled _My CARICOM_ came from Jamaican Adiel Thomas who
won US$5,000, and a third-place song titled _One CARICOM_ by Carmella Lawrence
of St. Kitts and Nevis, won US$2,500. The other songs from the top-ten
finalists (in no particular order) were:

  * _One Region one Caribbean_ from Anguilla,
  * _One Caribbean Family_ from Jamaica,
  * _CARICOM’s Light_ from St. Vincent & the Grenadines,
  * _We Are CARICOM_ from Dominica,
  * _Together As one_ from Dominica,
  * _Blessed CARICOM_ from Jamaica,
  * _Together We Rise_ from Jamaica.

The first official performance of _Celebrating CARICOM_ by Henderson took
place on Tuesday 1 July 2014 at the opening ceremony for the Thirty-Fifth
Regional Meeting of the Conference of Heads of Government in Antigua and
Barbuda.

### Celebration

#### CARICOM Day

The celebration of **CARICOM Day** is the selected day some Caribbean
Community (CARICOM) countries officially recognise the commemorative date of
signing of the Treaty of Chaguaramas, the agreement that established CARICOM
on 4 July 1973. The Treaty was signed in Chaguaramas, Trinidad & Tobago by
then leaders of: Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago. CARICOM
Day is recognised as an official public holiday in Guyana where the
secretariat is based, and is observed on the first Monday of July. The
government of Antigua and Barbuda has also implemented CARICOM Day as a
holiday.

The day features activities that are organised by government entities such as
parades, pageants, and campaigns to educate people about CARICOM.

### Caribbean Festival of Arts – CARIFESTA

**Caribbean Festival of Arts** , commonly known as **CARIFESTA** , is an
annual festival for promoting arts of the Caribbean with a different country
hosting the event each year. It was started to provide a venue to "depict the
life of the people of the Region, their heroes, morals, myths, traditions,
beliefs, creativity and ways of expression" by fostering a sense of Caribbean
unity, and motivating artists by showing the best of their home country. It
began under the auspices of Guyana's then President Forbes Burnham in 1972,
who was inspired by other singular arts festivals in the region.
