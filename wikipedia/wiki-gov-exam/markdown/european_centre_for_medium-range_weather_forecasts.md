European intergovernmental weather computation organisation based in the UK

The **European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts** (**ECMWF**) is an
independent intergovernmental organisation supported by most of the nations of
Europe. It is based at three sites: Shinfield Park, Reading, United Kingdom;
Bologna, Italy; and Bonn, Germany. It operates one of the largest
supercomputer complexes in Europe and the world's largest archive of numerical
weather prediction data.

## History

members as of 2015

co-operation agreement

ECMWF was established in 1975, in recognition of the need to pool the
scientific and technical resources of Europe's meteorological services and
institutions for the production of weather forecasts for medium-range
timescales (up to approximately two weeks) and of the economic and social
benefits expected from it. The Centre employs about 350 staff, mostly
appointed from across the member states and co-operating states.

In 2017, the centre's member states accepted an offer from the Italian
Government to move ECMWF's data centre to Bologna, Italy. The new site, a
former tobacco factory, would be redesigned by the architecture firm gmp.

During 2020, the Centre arranged to move its Copernicus operations away from
Reading and into European Union territory. Following bids from Toulouse,
Italy, Austria, Germany, Spain and Ireland, eventually Bonn (Germany) was
chosen. The move has been directly attributed to Brexit.

In early 2024, it was announced that the ECMWF's headquarters, currently at
Shinfield Road in the English town of Reading, would be relocated to a new
complex to be constructed on the Whiteknights Park campus of the University of
Reading. Construction of this complex started in early 2025, with completion
expected in early 2027.

## Objectives

ECMWF aims to provide accurate medium-range global weather forecasts out to 15
days and seasonal forecasts out to 12 months. Its products are provided to the
national weather services of its member states and co-operating states as a
complement to their national short-range and climatological activities, and
those national states use ECMWF's products for their own national duties, in
particular to give early warning of potentially damaging severe weather.

ECMWF's core mission is to:

  * Produce numerical weather forecasts and monitor planetary systems that influence weather
  * Carry out scientific and technical research to improve forecast skill
  * Maintain an archive of meteorological data

To deliver this core mission, the Centre provides:

  * Twice-daily global numerical weather forecasts
  * Air quality analysis
  * Atmospheric composition monitoring
  * Climate monitoring
  * Ocean circulation analysis
  * Hydrological prediction

The Centre develops and operates global atmospheric models and data
assimilation systems for the dynamics, thermodynamics and composition of the
Earth's atmosphere and for interacting parts of the Earth-system. It uses
numerical weather prediction methods to prepare forecasts and their initial
conditions, and it contributes to monitoring the relevant parts of the Earth
system.

### Copernicus

The centre currently serves as the Entrusted Entity responsible for delivery
of two of the Services of the EU's Copernicus Programme. The two services are
the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate
Change Service (C3S).

The Centre arranged to move its Copernicus operations away from Reading and
into Bonn (Germany) in 2020. The move has been directly attributed to Brexit.

## Work and projects

### Forecasting

Numerical weather prediction (NWP) requires input of meteorological data,
collected by satellites and earth observation systems such as automatic and
crewed weather stations, aircraft (including commercial flights), ships and
weather balloons. Assimilation of this data is used to produce an initial
state of a computer model of the atmosphere, from which an atmospheric model
is used to forecast the weather. These forecasts are typically:

  * medium-range forecasts, predicting the weather up to 15 days ahead
  * monthly forecasts, predicting the weather on a weekly basis 30 days ahead
  * seasonal forecasts up to 12 months ahead.

Over the past three decades ECMWF's wide-ranging programme of research has
played a major role in developing such assimilation and modelling systems.
This improves the accuracy and reliability of weather forecasting by about a
day per decade, so that a seven-day forecast now (2015) is as accurate as a
three-day forecast was four decades ago (1975).

### Monthly and seasonal forecasts

ECMWF's monthly and seasonal forecasts provide early predictions of events
such as heat waves, cold spells and droughts, as well as their impacts on
sectors such as agriculture, energy and health. Since ECMWF runs a wave model,
there are also predictions of coastal waves and storm surges in European
waters which can be used to provide warnings.

### Early warning of severe weather events

Forecasts of severe weather events allow appropriate mitigating action to be
taken and contingency plans to be put into place by the authorities and the
public. The increased time gained by issuing accurate warnings can save lives,
for instance by evacuating people from a storm surge area. Authorities and
businesses can plan to maintain services around threats such as high winds,
floods or snow.

In October 2012 the ECMWF model suggested seven days in advance that Hurricane
Sandy was likely to make landfall on the East Coast of the United States. It
also predicted the intensity and track of the November 2012 nor'easter, which
impacted the east coast a week after Sandy.

ECMWF's Extreme Forecast Index (EFI) was developed as a tool to identify where
the EPS (Ensemble Prediction System) forecast distribution differs
substantially from that of the model climate[_clarification needed_]. It
contains information regarding variability of weather parameters, in location
and time and can highlight an abnormality of a weather situation without
having to define specific space- and time-dependent thresholds.

### Satellite data

ECMWF, through its partnerships with EUMETSAT, ESA, the EU and others,
exploits satellite data for operational numerical weather prediction and
operational seasonal forecasting with coupled atmosphere–ocean–land models.
The increasing amount of satellite data and the development of more
sophisticated ways of extracting information from that data have made a major
contribution to improving the accuracy and utility of NWP forecasts.

### Reanalysis

ECMWF supports research on climate variability using an approach known as
reanalysis. This involves feeding weather observations collected over decades
into a NWP system to recreate past atmospheric, sea- and land-surface
conditions over specific time periods to obtain a clearer picture of how the
climate has changed. Reanalysis provides a four-dimensional picture of the
atmosphere and effectively allows monitoring of the variability and change of
global climate, thereby contributing also to the understanding and attribution
of climate change.

To date, and with support from Europe's National Meteorological Services and
the European Commission, ECMWF has conducted several major reanalyses of the
global atmosphere: the first ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) project generated
reanalyses from December 1978 to February 1994; the ERA-40 project generated
reanalyses from September 1957 to August 2002. The ERA-Interim reanalysis
covered the period from 1979 onwards. A reanalysis product (ERA5) with higher
spatial resolution (31 km) was released by ECMWF in 2019 as part of the
Copernicus Climate Change Service.

### Operational forecast model

ECMWF's operational forecasts are produced from its "Integrated Forecast
System" (sometimes informally known in the United States as the "European
model") which is run every twelve hours and forecasts out to ten days.

It includes both a "deterministic forecast" mode and an ensemble. The
deterministic forecast is a single model run that is relatively high in
resolution as well as in computational expense. The ensemble is relatively low
(about half that of the deterministic) in resolution (and in computational
expense), so less accurate. But it is run 51 times in parallel, from slightly
different initial conditions to give a spread of likelihood over the range of
the forecast.

As of 2021, the ECMWF's weather model is generally considered to be the most
accurate weather forecasting model.
