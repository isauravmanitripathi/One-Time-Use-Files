The **Indian Ocean Commission** (French: _Commission de l'Océan Indien_ ,
**COI**) is an intergovernmental organisation that links five African Indian
Ocean nations — i.e. Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Réunion (France), and
Seychelles. There are also eight observers as of August 2025 — i.e. China, the
European Union, La Francophonie, the Order of Malta, India, Japan, the United
Nations and South Korea.

The IOC was created in 1982 in Port-Louis, Mauritius, and institutionalised in
1984 by the Victoria Agreement (Seychelles). The organisation coordinates
cooperative efforts amongst its member and observer nations which primarily
focus on environmental management and preservation. Some of the more specific
areas of focus in its past projects include maritime concerns and fisheries,
the needs of growing island states, adapting to climate change outcomes, food
security and public health.

## History

The IOC was created in 1982 in Port Louis, by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs
of Mauritius, Madagascar and Seychelles**.**

In 1984, the General Cooperation Agreement signed in Victoria (Seychelles)
institutionalised the organization.

In 1986 — Comoros and Réunion (France), joined the organisation.

In 1989, the IOC was provided with a General Secretariat. The headquarters of
the IOC is located in Mauritius.

### Development

Since the early 1990s, the IOC has been implementing cooperation projects in
environmental management and preservation with the support of the European
Union and French cooperation. Over the course of these projects, the IOC has
acquired recognised expertise in the management of marine and coastal
environments, fisheries and the preservation of biodiversity.

At the beginning of the 2000s, the IOC constantly advocated the specific needs
of developing islands**,** particularly in conferences organised by the United
Nations.

In September 2005, the IOC requested observer status at the UN General
Assembly.

In 2016, the China became the first observer member of the organisation. It is
later followed in 2017 by La Francophonie, the Order of Malta, and the
European Union.

In 2018, the IOC assumes the chairmanship of the Contact Group on Piracy off
the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS) for a period of two years. In 2020, Kenya takes
over the chairmanship. However, the IOC continues to serve as the secretariat
of the CGPCS.

In 2019, at a ministerial retreat in Moroni (Comoros), the Moroni Declaration
on the Future of the IOC is adopted. This text deals with the modernisation of
the IOC.

During the 34th Council of Ministers of 6 March 2020 in Seychelles, the
founding text of the IOC — namely the Victoria Agreement, is revised.

In 2020 — India, Japan, and the United Nations became observer members.

The IOC's project portfolio has expanded considerably i.e. political
stability, public health, gender, mobility, entrepreneurship, infrastructure,
regional connectivity (digital, air, maritime), trade negotiations, maritime
security, food security and agricultural development, fisheries and fisheries
surveillance, climate change mitigation, sustainable coastal zone management,
waste management, use of earth observation technologies for environmental
monitoring, renewable energy, culture, etc.

The IOC has a dozen technical and financial partners, among which the European
Union and the French Development Agency.

In May 2023, Mauritius assumed the presidency of the Council of Ministers.

In April 2025, French President Emmanuel Macron called for the integration of
Mayotte as a member of the IOC, advocating for a "pragmatic approach" with the
Comoros.

On 17 April 2025, South Korea became the eighth observer member of the
organisation.

### Bodies

The **Council of Ministers** (composed of the foreign ministers of the member
countries) provides the strategic and political direction of the IOC. It is
the supreme decision-making body of the organisation. The chairmanship of the
IOC Council of Ministers is annual and rotating (in alphabetical order of
member countries).

The **Committee of Permanent Liaison Officers** (composed of senior officials
from member states) is responsible for monitoring the implementation of these
decisions.

The **General Secretariat** , based in Ebene, Mauritius, is responsible for
implementing the decisions of the decision-making bodies. It develops and
manages cooperation projects. It is responsible for mobilizing resources from
the donor community.

The revised Victoria Agreement (2020) makes the Summit of Heads of State and
Government a statutory body of the organisation. The IOC Summit will now be
held every five years to set the strategic and political direction of the
organisation.

As an intergovernmental organisation of cooperation, the Indian Ocean
Commission promotes peace and stability, maritime security, food security,
environmental conservation, fisheries, climate change adaptation, the
interests of island developing states, public health and cultural expression.

Its action is thus in line with the international frameworks to which its
member states are signatories, such as the Global Agenda for Sustainable
Development to 2030 and the Global Climate Agreement, among others.

In 2018 the IOC launched its Information Fusion Centre for the Indian Ocean
region (IFC-IOR) in Madagascar, and the Seychelles Regional Centre for
Operational Coordination (RCOC) to conduct joint operations as the executive
arm of the Maritime Security Architecture (MSA) of the Western Indian Ocean.
In September 2022, IFC-IOR and RCOC conducted their first joint operations
with EUNAVFOR.

In 2020, the IOC is implementing 14 cooperation projects. Over the period
2020–2025, it will manage a total project budget of approximately 130 million
euros.
