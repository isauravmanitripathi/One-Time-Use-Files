A **League of Nations mandate** represented a legal status under international
law for specific territories following World War I, involving the transfer of
control from one nation to another. These mandates served as legal documents
establishing the internationally agreed terms for administering the territory
on behalf of the League of Nations. Combining elements of both a treaty and a
constitution, these mandates contained minority rights clauses that provided
for the rights of petition and adjudication by the Permanent Court of
International Justice.

The mandate system was established under Article 22 of the Covenant of the
League of Nations, entered into force on 28 June 1919. With the dissolution of
the League of Nations after World War II, it was stipulated at the Yalta
Conference that the remaining mandates should be placed under the trusteeship
of the United Nations, subject to future discussions and formal agreements.
Most of the remaining mandates of the League of Nations (with the exception of
South West Africa) thus eventually became United Nations trust territories.

Two governing principles formed the core of the Mandate System, being non-
annexation of the territory and its administration as a "sacred trust of
civilisation" to develop the territory for the benefit of its native people.

According to historian Susan Pedersen, colonial administration in the mandates
did not differ substantially from colonial administration elsewhere. Even
though the Covenant of the League committed the great powers to govern the
mandates differently, the main difference appeared to be that the colonial
powers spoke differently about the mandates than their other colonial
possessions.

## Basis

The mandate system was established by Article 22 of the Covenant of the League
of Nations, drafted by the victors of World War I. The article referred to
territories which after the war were no longer ruled by their previous
sovereign, but their peoples were not considered "able to stand by themselves
under the strenuous conditions of the modern world". The article called for
such people's tutelage to be "entrusted to advanced nations who by reason of
their resources, their experience or their geographical position can best
undertake this responsibility".

U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and South African General Jan Smuts played
influential roles in pushing for the establishment of a mandates system. The
mandates system reflected a compromise between Smuts (who wanted colonial
powers to annex the territories) and Wilson (who wanted trusteeship over the
territories).

## Generalities

All of the territories subject to League of Nations mandates were previously
controlled by states defeated in World War I, principally Imperial Germany and
the Ottoman Empire. The mandates were fundamentally different from the
protectorates in that the mandatory power undertook obligations to the
inhabitants of the territory and to the League of Nations.

The process of establishing the mandates consisted of two phases:

  1. The formal removal of sovereignty of the state previously controlling the territory.
  2. The transfer of mandatory powers to individual states among the Allied Powers.

### Treaties

The divestiture of Germany's overseas colonies, along with three territories
disentangled from its European homeland area (the Free City of Danzig, the
Memel Territory, and the Saar), was accomplished in the Treaty of Versailles
(1919), with the territories being allotted among the Allies on 7 May of that
year. Ottoman territorial claims were first addressed in the Treaty of Sèvres
(1920) and finalised in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). The Ottoman territories
were allotted among the Allied Powers at the San Remo conference in 1920.

## Types of mandates

Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, highlighting the three
mandate classes:

  * Red: **Class A** (ex Ottoman)
  * Blue: **Class B** (ex German Central Africa)
  * Yellow: **Class C** (ex German South West Africa and Pacific)

The League of Nations decided the exact level of control by the mandatory
power over each mandate on an individual basis. However, in every case the
mandatory power was forbidden to construct fortifications or raise an army
within the territory of the mandate, and was required to present an annual
report on the territory to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of
Nations.

The mandates were divided into three distinct groups based upon the level of
development each population had achieved at that time.

### Class A mandates

The first group, or _Class A mandates_ , were territories formerly controlled
by the Ottoman Empire that were deemed to "... have reached a stage of
development where their existence as independent nations can be provisionally
recognised subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by
a Mandatory until such time as they are able to stand alone. The wishes of
these communities must be a principal consideration in the selection of the
Mandatory."

### Class B mandates

The second group of mandates, or _Class B mandates_ , were all former German
colonies in West and Central Africa, referred to by Germany as _Schutzgebiete_
(protectorates or territories), which were deemed to require a greater level
of control by the mandatory power: "...the Mandatory must be responsible for
the administration of the territory under conditions which will guarantee
freedom of conscience and religion." The mandatory power was forbidden to
construct military or naval bases within the mandates.

### Class C mandates

_Class C mandates_ , including South West Africa and the South Pacific
Islands, were considered to be "best administered under the laws of the
Mandatory as integral portions of its territory."

## List of mandates

Class | Mandate | Territory | Mandate Power  | Prior name | Prior sovereignty | Comments  | Current state | Document   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
**A** | Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon | Greater Lebanon | France | Ottoman sanjaks of Beirut, Tripoli, and Mount Lebanon | Ottoman Empire | 29 September 1923 – 24 October 1945. Joined the United Nations on 24 October 1945 as an independent state and Founding Member | Lebanon |   
Syria | Ottoman sanjaks of Damascus, Hauran, Latakia, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, and Zor | 29 September 1923 – 24 October 1945: This mandate included Hatay Province (a former Ottoman Alexandretta sanjak), which broke away from the mandate on 2 September 1938 to become a separate French protectorate, which lasted until Hatay Province was ceded to the new Republic of Turkey on 29 June 1939. Joined the United Nations on 24 October 1945 as an independent state | Syria  
Mandate for Palestine | Mandatory Palestine | United Kingdom | Ottoman sanjaks of Jerusalem, Nablus, and Acre | 29 September 1923 – 15 May 1948. A United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine for peacefully dividing the remainder of the Mandate failed. The Mandate terminated at midnight between 14 May and 15 May 1948. On the evening of 14 May, the Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine had declared the establishment of the State of Israel. Following the war, 75% of the area was controlled by the new State of Israel. Other parts, until 1967, formed the West Bank of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the All-Palestine Government under the Egyptian-controlled Gaza Strip. | Israel  
Palestine |   
Emirate of Transjordan | Ottoman sanjaks of Hauran and Ma'an | In April 1921, the Emirate of Transjordan was provisionally added as an autonomous area under the United Kingdom, and it became the independent Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan (later Jordan) on 17 June 1946 upon joint ratification of the Treaty of London of 1946. | Jordan  
_Indirect_ | Mandatory Iraq | Various Ottoman sanjaks | The draft British Mandate for Mesopotamia was not enacted and was replaced by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of October 1922. Britain committed to act the responsibilities of a Mandatory Power in 1924. Iraq attained independence from the United Kingdom on 3 October 1932. | Iraq |   
**B** | Belgian Mandate for East Africa | Ruanda-Urundi | Belgium | German East Africa | German Empire | From 20 July 1922 to 13 December 1946. Formerly two separate German protectorates, they were joined as a single mandate on 20 July 1922. From 1 March 1926 to 30 June 1960, Ruanda-Urundi was in administrative union with the neighbouring colony of the Belgian Congo. After 13 December 1946, it became a United Nations trust territory, remaining under Belgian administration until the separate nations of Rwanda and Burundi gained independence on 1 July 1962. | Rwanda  
Burundi |   
British Mandate for East Africa | Tanganyika Territory | United Kingdom | From 20 July 1922 to 11 December 1946. It became a United Nations trust territory on 11 December 1946, and was granted internal self-rule on 1 May 1961. On 9 December 1961, it became independent while retaining the British monarch as nominal head of state, transforming into a republic on the same day the next year. On 26 April 1964, Tanganyika merged with the neighbouring island of Zanzibar to become the modern nation of Tanzania. | Tanzania | _Equivalent document as for Ruanda-Urundi, with all articles substantially the same_

## Rules of establishment

Map of the League of Nations mandates

According to the Council of the League of Nations, meeting of August 1920:
"draft mandates adopted by the Allied and Associated Powers would not be
definitive until they had been considered and approved by the League... the
legal title held by the mandatory Power must be a double one: one conferred by
the Principal Powers and the other conferred by the League of Nations."

Three steps were required to establish a Mandate under international law: (1)
The Principal Allied and Associated Powers confer a mandate on one of their
number or on a third power; (2) the principal powers officially notify the
council of the League of Nations that a certain power has been appointed
mandatory for such a certain defined territory; and (3) the council of the
League of Nations takes official cognisance of the appointment of the
mandatory power and informs the latter that it [the council] considers it as
invested with the mandate, and at the same time notifies it of the terms of
the mandate, after ascertaining whether they are in conformance with the
provisions of the covenant."

The U.S. State Department's _Digest of International Law_ says that the terms
of the Treaty of Lausanne provided for the application of the principles of
state succession to the "A" Mandates. The Treaty of Versailles provisionally
recognised the former Ottoman communities as independent nations. It also
required Germany to recognise the disposition of the former Ottoman
territories and to recognise the new states laid down within their boundaries.
The terms of the Treaty of Lausanne required the newly created states that
acquired the territory detached from the Ottoman Empire to pay annuities on
the Ottoman public debt and to assume responsibility for the administration of
concessions that had been granted by the Ottomans. The treaty also let the
States acquire, without payment, all the property and possessions of the
Ottoman Empire situated within their territory. The treaty provided that the
League of Nations was responsible for establishing an arbitral court to
resolve disputes that might arise and stipulated that its decisions were
final.

A disagreement regarding the legal status and the portion of the annuities to
be paid by the "A" mandates was settled when an Arbitrator ruled that some of
the mandates contained more than one State:

> The difficulty arises here how one is to regard the Asiatic countries under
> the British and French mandates. Iraq is a Kingdom in regard to which Great
> Britain has undertaken responsibilities equivalent to those of a Mandatory
> Power. Under the British mandate, Palestine and Transjordan have each an
> entirely separate organisation. We are, therefore, in the presence of three
> States sufficiently separate to be considered as distinct Parties. France
> has received a single mandate from the Council of the League of Nations, but
> in the countries subject to that mandate, one can distinguish two distinct
> States: Syria and the Lebanon, each State possessing its own constitution
> and a nationality clearly different from the other.

## Later history

After the United Nations was founded in 1945 and the League of Nations was
disbanded, all but one of the mandated territories became United Nations trust
territories, a roughly equivalent status. In each case, the colonial power
that held the mandate on each territory became the administering power of the
trusteeship, except that of the Empire of Japan, which had been defeated in
World War II, lost its mandate over the South Pacific islands, which became a
"strategic trust territory" known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands under U.S. administration.

The sole exception to the transformation of the League of Nations mandates
into UN trusteeships was that of South Africa and its mandated territory South
West Africa. Rather than placing South West Africa under trusteeship like
other former mandates, South Africa proposed annexation, a proposition
rejected by the UN General Assembly. Despite South Africa's resistance, the
International Court of Justice affirmed that South Africa continued to have
international obligations regarding the South West Africa mandate. Eventually,
in 1990, the mandated territory, now Namibia, gained independence, culminating
from the Tripartite Accords and the resolution of the South African Border War
— a prolonged guerrilla conflict against the apartheid regime that lasted from
1966 until 1990.

Nearly all the former League of Nations mandates had become sovereign states
by 1990, including all of the former UN trust territories with the exception
of a few successor entities of the gradually dismembered Trust Territory of
the Pacific Islands (formerly Japan's South Pacific Trust Mandate). These
exceptions include the Northern Mariana Islands which is a commonwealth in
political union with the U.S. with the status of unincorporated organised
territory. The Northern Mariana Islands does elect its own governor to serve
as territorial head of government, but it remains a U.S. territory with its
head of state being the President of the United States and federal funds to
the commonwealth administered by the Office of Insular Affairs of the U.S.
Department of the Interior.

Remnant Micronesia and the Marshall Islands, the heirs of the last territories
of the Trust, attained final independence on 22 December 1990. (The UN
Security Council ratified termination of trusteeship, effectively dissolving
trusteeship status, on 10 July 1987.) The Republic of Palau, split off from
the Federated States of Micronesia, became the last to effectively gain its
independence, on 1 October 1994.
