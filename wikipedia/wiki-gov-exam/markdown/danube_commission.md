International river management body

The **Danube Commission** (French: _Commission du Danube_ ; German:
_Donaukommission_ ; Russian: Дунайская комиссия, romanized:  _Dunayskaya
komissiya_ ; Ukrainian: Дунайська комісія, romanized:  _Dunayska komisiya_) is
concerned with the maintenance and improvement of navigation conditions of the
Danube River, from its source in Germany to its outlets in Romania and
Ukraine, leading to the Black Sea. It was established in 1948 by seven
countries bordering the river, replacing previous commissions that had also
included representatives of non-riparian powers. Its predecessor commissions
were among the first attempts at internationalizing the police powers of
sovereign states for a common cause.

Members include representatives from Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany,
Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine.

The commission dates to the Paris Conferences of 1856, which established for
the first time an international regime to safeguard free navigation on the
Danube, and of 1921, which resurrected the international regime after the
First World War.

## History

As a result of the Danube River Conference of 1948, the river system was
divided into three administrations: the regular River Commission (which had
existed in one form or another since 1856), a bilateral Romania–USSR
administration between Brăila and the mouth of the Sulina channel, and a
bilateral Romania–Yugoslavia administration at the Iron Gate. Both of the
latter were technically under the control of the main commission, members of
which were – at the beginning – Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania,
Ukraine, the USSR, and Yugoslavia.

### 1949-1999

#### The Cominform rift

When the treaty was adopted, Yugoslavia had already been expelled from the
Cominform, the political grouping of all the Communist parties in the Soviet
bloc. Yet it still voted down the line with the other non-Western countries,
nearly 200 miles of the Danube flowing through its territory and the only
navigable channel through the Iron Gate being on the Yugoslav side of the
Romanian border. Nevertheless, when the new commission organized its staff,
the Yugoslavs were offered only four minor posts out of sixty permanent
appointments. The Josip Broz Tito government refused them all.

The commission also fixed freight rates that allegedly discriminated against
Yugoslavia, Belgrade officials said. Faced with this situation,

> the Yugoslav delegate to the commission has been most uncooperative. He has
> been a minority of one on every major question that has come up for
> discussion. He opposed, for example, the creation of a special
> _administration fluviale_ [river administration] run by a joint
> Czechoslovak–Hungarian Commission to control the difficult Gabcikovo–Gönyű
> sector… The Yugoslavs lost by six votes to one. But they have at least got
> their own back by refusing to pay their share of the commission's expenses.

Another report, however, stated that it was the commission itself that "had
made a determined effort to avoid accepting Yugoslavia's share in the
expenses," which were even larger than the Yugoslav contribution to the United
Nations.

These grievances were compounded by the vast powers wielded by the Soviet
Union. At the session of November 11, 1949, a Soviet proposal was adopted
vesting complete powers of appointment, organization, leadership, and
negotiation in the secretary, who was the Russian representative. By 1950,

> the Soviet government [had] assumed complete control over the Commission's
> administrative machinery and reduced the other governments to nominal
> status… Yugoslav representatives [had] been excluded from every important
> committee.

At the May 1951 meeting, the Yugoslavs walked out, forcing adjournment. They
were protesting the "railroading" of shipping regulations they thought would
hurt their economy: a rule forbidding inspection of foreign ships by the
nations through which they were passing. The Yugoslavs charged sabotage and
infiltration by Soviet agents aboard the ships. In August, Yugoslavia told the
USSR in a note that the commission's rules were "contrary in letter and
spirit" to the 1948 convention, giving the Soviets control of the waterway in
violation of national sovereignty.

At the commission's fifth session, in June 1952, Yugoslavia proposed the
establishment of an executive committee to be composed of one representative
from each country; it would control business between formal sessions of the
commission. The Soviet bloc voted to study the plan "sometime between the
sixth and seventh sessions." Next, Yugoslavia proposed that the top posts
should be rotated among the six members every three years, but the commission
rejected that suggestion in June 1953. Rumors sprang up that Yugoslavia would
resign from the commission because of this treatment.

Slowly, though, the picture changed with a thaw in Yugoslav–Soviet relations.
On December 15, 1953, Dragoje Djuric, a Yugoslav diplomat, was elected to the
secretary's post, a Hungarian was named president and a Bulgarian vice
president. A Belgrade spokesman said in glee that the sessions were unusually
harmonious because the Iron Curtain countries were agreeing to "all proposals
put on the agenda by the Yugoslavs," one of them being a Yugoslav–Hungarian
proposal to move the commission's headquarters in 1954 from Galatz to
Budapest.

Later, though, the Soviet bloc intimated the downgrading of the Danube
Commission. A Vienna dispatch reported that the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance (Comecon), the Eastern European equivalent of the Marshall Plan,
had created a new, permanent Danube committee of its own, its purpose to draft
measures for using Danube water for power, irrigation, and navigation. It
ordered at a Moscow meeting that plans be made to raise the level of the river
by dams so seagoing ships could move farther upstream.

#### East–west detente

The Danube Commission was seen as a bridge between East and West. Czechoslovak
researcher Juraj Cuth wrote in 1960 that the Danube Commission, "has become an
important center of close cooperation of all the riparian states… It has
turned into a forum of cooperation between representatives of socialist and
capitalist states."

#### Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros Dams

In 1977 the Gabčíkovo–Nagymaros Dams project was initiated by the Budapest
Treaty between the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and the Hungarian People's
Republic. The project aimed at preventing catastrophic floods in the Danube
river, producing clean electricity by damming the river, creating reservoirs,
locks for navigation and a hydro electric power plant. Slovakia took over half
of the project on 1 December 1993 when the country split however Hungary had
abandoned the project in 1989 and tried to get out of the agreement. The
International Court of Justice was called upon to judge the case and found
Hungary had breached their legal obligations in almost all points, ordering
that the project be completed. It was 2017 before the legal dispute was
closed.

### 2000 - current

In 2000 an agreement was reached by the Danube Commission, the Central
Commission for Navigation on the Rhine and the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe regarding the carriage of goods by inland waterways,
which came into effect in 2005 and aims to help transport users and
standardise waterway rules in Europe.

#### During Russo-Ukrainian War

After the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine during the
12th extraordinary session on 17 March 2022 the Representatives of the member
states adopted the Decision concerning the military aggression by the Russian
Federation against Ukraine, violating the basic principles of the Belgrade
Convention (doc. DC/SES-XII Extr./3). According to this decision the full
powers of all representatives of the Russian Federation have been declined;
they have been excluded from the participation in all meetings at the Danube
Commission and its working bodies until the restoration of peace, sovereignty
and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized
borders.

During its 100th session on 14 December 2023 the Danube Commission decided
that Russian membership is incompatible given its missile and drone strikes on
the Lower Danube. Russia must leave by February 29th, 2024, or the
Commission’s members will no longer recognize their commitments to Russia
under the founding Belgrade Convention.

## Future plans

In 2019 and with a majority of members of the commission being EU members,
harmonisation with EU transport plans is envisaged, as is a modernisation of
the commission to include non Danube river members and to increase the powers
of the commission. France, Turkey and the European Union have declared they
want to become members.
