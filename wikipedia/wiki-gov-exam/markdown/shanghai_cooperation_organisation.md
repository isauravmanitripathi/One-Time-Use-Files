Eurasian multilateral security organization

The **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation** (**SCO**) is a Eurasian political,
economic and international security organization of ten member states. It was
established in 2001 by the People's Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Russia, and Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. In June 2017, it expanded to eight
states, with India and Pakistan. Iran joined the group in July 2023, and
Belarus in July 2024. Several countries are engaged as observers or dialogue
partners.

It is the world's largest regional organization in terms of geographic scope
and population, covering approximately 24% of the world's total area (65% of
Eurasia) and 42% of the world population. As of 2024, its combined nominal GDP
accounts for around 23%, while its GDP based on PPP comprises approximately
36% of the world's total.

The SCO is the successor to the **Shanghai Five** , formed in 1996 between
China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, and Tajikistan. In June 2001, the
leaders of these nations and Uzbekistan met in Shanghai to announce a new
organization with deeper political and economic cooperation.

The SCO is governed by the Heads of State Council (HSC), its supreme decision
making body, which meets once a year. The organization also contains the
Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS).

## Origins

### The Shanghai Five

The Shanghai Five group was created on 26 April 1996 when the heads of states
of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan signed the Treaty on
Deepening Military Trust in Border Regions in Shanghai.

On 24 April 1997 the same countries signed the Treaty on Reduction of Military
Forces in Border Regions in a meeting in Moscow, Russia. On 20 May 1997
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin signed a
declaration on a "multipolar world".

Subsequent annual summits of the Shanghai Five group occurred in Almaty,
Kazakhstan in 1998, in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan in 1999, and in Dushanbe,
Tajikistan in 2000. At the Dushanbe summit, members agreed to "oppose
intervention in other countries' internal affairs on the reason of
'humanitarianism' and 'protecting human rights;' and support the efforts of
one another in safeguarding the five countries' national independence,
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and social stability." The Shanghai Five
structure helped speed up the members' resolution of border disputes, agree on
military deployments in border areas, and address security threats.

### Developing institutional forms

In 2001, the annual summit returned to Shanghai and the group was
institutionalized. The five member nations first admitted Uzbekistan in the
Shanghai Five mechanism. On 15 June 2001, all six heads of state signed the
_Declaration of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation_ , praising the role played
thus far by the Shanghai Five mechanism and aiming to transform it to a higher
level of cooperation. From 2001 to 2008, the SCO developed rapidly,
establishing a number of permanent bodies and _ad hoc_ initiatives dealing
with economic and security matters.

In June 2002, the heads of the SCO member states met in Saint Petersburg,
Russia and signed the _SCO Charter_ which expounded on the organisation's
purposes, principles, structures and forms of operation. It entered into force
on 19 September 2003.

In July 2005, at the summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, with representatives of
India, Iran, Mongolia and Pakistan attending an SCO summit for the first time,
Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of the Kazakhstan, greeted the guests in
words that had never been used before in any context: "The leaders of the
states sitting at this negotiation table are representatives of half of
humanity".

By 2007, the SCO had initiated over twenty large-scale projects related to
transportation, energy and telecommunications and held regular meetings of
security, military, defence, foreign affairs, economic, cultural, banking, and
other officials from its member states.

In July 2015, in Ufa, Russia, the SCO decided to admit India and Pakistan as
full members. In June 2016 in Tashkent, both signed the memorandum of
obligations, thereby starting the process of joining the SCO. In June 2017, at
a summit in Kazakhstan, India and Pakistan officially joined SCO as full
members.

In 2004, the SCO established relations with the United Nations (where it is an
observer in the General Assembly), the Commonwealth of Independent States in
2005, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2005, the
Collective Security Treaty Organization in 2007, the Economic Cooperation
Organization in 2007, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2011,
the Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA)
in 2014, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific (ESCAP) in 2015. in 2018, SCO Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure
(RATS) has established relations with the African Union's African Centre for
the Study and Research on Terrorism (ACSRT).

## Organisational structure

As of 2020, the Council of Heads of State was the top decision-making body in
the SCO, meeting at the annual SCO summits in one of the member states'
capital cities. Because of their government structure, the prime ministers of
the parliamentary democracies of India and Pakistan attend the SCO Council of
Heads of State summits, as their responsibilities are similar to the
presidents of other SCO nations.

As of the 4 July 2024 meeting, the Council of Heads of State consists of:

  * Aleksandr Lukashenko  (Belarus)
  * Xi Jinping (China)
  * Narendra Modi (India)
  * Masoud Pezeshkian  (Iran)
  * Kassym-Jomart Tokayev (Kazakhstan)
  * Sadyr Japarov (Kyrgyzstan)
  * Shehbaz Sharif (Pakistan)
  * Vladimir Putin (Russia)
  * Emomali Rahmon (Tajikistan)
  * Shavkat Mirziyoyev (Uzbekistan)

The Council of Heads of Government is the second-highest council in the
organisation. This council also holds annual summits, at which time members
discuss issues of multilateral cooperation and approves the organisation's
budget. As of the 1 November 2022 meeting, Council of Heads of Government
consists of:

  * Aleksandr Turchin (Belarus)
  * Li Qiang (China)
  * Narendra Modi (India) (usually sends a deputy, such as EAM Subrahmanyam Jaishankar at the 2021 summit)
  * Alihan Smaiylov (Kazakhstan)
  * Akylbek Japarov (Kyrgyzstan)
  * Shehbaz Sharif (Pakistan) (usually sends a deputy, such as Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Andleeb Abbas at the 2020 summit)
  * Mikhail Mishustin (Russia)
  * Qohir Rasulzoda (Tajikistan)
  * Abdulla Aripov (Uzbekistan)

As of 2007, the Council of Foreign Ministers also held regular meetings, where
they discussed the current international situation and interaction with other
international organisations. As of 2021, the Council of National Coordinators
coordinated the multilateral cooperation of member states within the framework
of the SCO's charter.

General on 1 January 2025.

The Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) Executive Committee,
headquartered in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, is a permanent organ of the SCO which
serves to promote cooperation of member states against the three evils of
terrorism, separatism and extremism. The Director of SCO RATS Executive
Committee is elected to a three-year term. Ularbek Sharsheev of Kyrgyzstan
became the current Director on 1 January 2025. Each member state also sends a
permanent representative to RATS.

### Guest attendances

Multiple international organisations and one country are guest attendances to
SCO summits.

  * Association of Southeast Asian Nations
  * Commonwealth of Independent States
  * Turkmenistan
  * United Nations

Turkmenistan has previously declared itself a permanently neutral country,
which was recognized by a resolution adopted by the United Nations General
Assembly in 1995, thus ostensibly precluding its membership in the SCO. At the
same time, Turkmenistan is a member of the Economic Cooperation Organization
since 1992 and an observer of the Organization of Turkic States since 2021.
Turkmenistan's head of state has been attending SCO summits since 2007 as a
guest attendee.

### Future membership possibilities

Country | Status applied for | Date   
---|---|---  
Bangladesh | Observer  | 2012   
Syria | Dialogue partner  | 2015   
Israel | Dialogue partner  | 2016   
Iraq | Dialogue partner  | 2019   
Algeria | Observer  | July 2023   
Laos | Dialogue partner  | 2024   
  
In 2010, the SCO approved a procedure for admitting new members. In 2011,
Turkey applied for dialogue partner status, which it obtained in 2013. At the
same time, Turkey is a NATO member and the European Union candidate country.
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has stated that he has discussed
the possibility of abandoning Turkey's candidacy of accession to the European
Union in return for full membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.
This was reinforced again on 21 November 2016, after the European Parliament
voted unanimously to suspend accession negotiations with Turkey. Two days
later, on 23 November 2016, Turkey was granted the chairmanship of SCO energy
club for the 2017 period. That made Turkey the first country to chair a club
in the organisation without full membership status. In 2022, at the 22nd
summit of the SCO, the Turkish president said that Turkey would seek full SCO
membership status. On 11 July 2024, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan
stated in a statement to the U.S. Newsweek magazine that they did not consider
Turkey's membership in NATO as an alternative to the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation and BRICS.

In 2011, Vietnam expressed interest in obtaining observer status (but has not
applied for it).

In 2012, Ukraine expressed interest in obtaining observer status. However,
since the deposition of President Viktor Yanukovych and increased tensions
with Russia, no application has been submitted and there are no current plans
to incorporate Ukraine into the organization.

Azerbaijan expects to receive observer status according to Azerbaijani Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Aykhan Hajizada. Azerbaijan will probably become a full
member of the SCO in a little while, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan
Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said during his meeting with President of the Republic
of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev on 3 July 2024 in Astana.

## Activities

### Cooperation on security

As of 2023, the SCO is primarily centered on security-related concerns,
describing the main threats it confronts as being terrorism, separatism and
extremism. It has addressed regional human trafficking and weapons trafficking
and created terrorist blacklists.

At SCO summit, held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on 16–17 June 2004, the Regional
Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) was established. On 21 April 2006, the SCO
announced plans to fight cross-border drug crimes under the counter-terrorism
rubric.

In October 2007, the SCO signed an agreement with the Collective Security
Treaty Organization (CSTO), in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe, to broaden
cooperation on issues such as security, crime, and drug trafficking.

As of 2010, the organisation was opposing cyberwarfare, saying that the
dissemination of information "harmful to the spiritual, moral and cultural
spheres of other states" should be considered a "security threat". An accord
adopted in 2009 defined "information war", in part, as an effort by a state to
undermine another's "political, economic, and social systems". _The Diplomat_
reported in 2017 that SCO has foiled 600 terror plots and extradited 500
terrorists through RATS. The 36th meeting of the Council of the RATS decided
to hold a joint anti-terror exercise, Pabbi-Antiterror-2021, in Pakistan in
2021.

At the summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, in July 2024, the SCO called for the
creation of a fair, multipolar world order based on the key role of the United
Nations, international law and the aspiration of sovereign states towards a
mutually beneficial partnership.

### Military activities

Nazarbayev and Islam Karimov

As of 2009, the organisation's activities expanded to include increased
military cooperation, intelligence sharing, and counterterrorism. At the same
time, leaders of SCO states repeatedly stated that the SCO was not a military
alliance.

As of 2023, the SCO had not provided military support in any actual conflicts.
However, as of 2017, military exercises have regularly been conducted among
members to promote cooperation and coordination against terrorism and other
external threats, and to maintain regional peace and stability. There have
been a number of SCO joint military exercises. The first of these was held in
2003, with the first phase taking place in Kazakhstan and the second in China.
Since then China and Russia have teamed up for large-scale war games in Peace
Mission 2005, Peace Mission 2007 and Peace Mission 2009, under the auspices of
the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. More than 4,000 soldiers participated
at the joint military exercises in Peace Mission 2007, which took place in
Chelyabinsk, Russia near the Ural Mountains, as was agreed upon in April 2006
at a meeting of SCO Defence Ministers. In 2010, Russian Defence Minister
Sergei Ivanov said that the exercises would be transparent and open to media
and the public. Following the war games' successful completion, Russian
officials began speaking of India joining such exercises in the future and the
SCO taking on a military role. Peace Mission 2010, conducted 9–25 September at
Kazakhstan's Matybulak training area, saw over 5,000 personnel from China,
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan conduct joint planning and
operational maneuvers.

The SCO has served as a platform for larger military announcements by members.
During the 2007 war games in Russia, with leaders of SCO member states in
attendance including Chinese President Hu Jintao, Russia's President Vladimir
Putin used the occasion to take advantage of a captive audience. Russian
strategic bombers, he said, would resume regular long-range patrols for the
first time since the Cold War. "Starting today, such tours of duty will be
conducted regularly and on the strategic scale", Putin said. "Our pilots have
been grounded for too long. They are happy to start a new life".

In June 2014, in the Tajik capital Dushanbe, the idea was brought up to merge
the SCO with the Collective Security Treaty Organization. However, as of late
2022, in the wake of Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many SCO and even
CSTO members had distanced themselves from military cooperation with Russia.

### Economic cooperation

In September 2003, a Framework Agreement to enhance economic cooperation was
signed by the SCO member states. At the same meeting the Premier of China, Wen
Jiabao, proposed a long-term objective to establish a free trade area in the
SCO, while other more immediate measures would be taken to improve the flow of
goods in the region. A follow-up plan with 100 specific actions was signed one
year later, on 23 September 2004.

In October 2005, during the Moscow Summit of the SCO, the Secretary General of
the Organisation said that the SCO would prioritise joint energy projects;
including in the oil and gas sector, the exploration of new hydrocarbon
reserves, and joint use of water resources. The creation of the SCO Interbank
Consortium was also agreed upon in order to fund future joint projects. In
February 2006, the first meeting of the SCO Interbank Association was held in
Beijing. In November 2006, at _The SCO: Results and Perspectives_ , an
international conference held in Almaty, the representative of the Russian
Foreign Ministry announced that Russia was developing plans for an SCO "Energy
Club". in November 2007, Moscow reiterated the need for this "energy club" at
an SCO summit. Other SCO members, however, did not commit themselves to the
idea. During the 2008 summit it was stated that "Against the backdrop of a
slowdown in the growth of world economy pursuing a responsible currency and
financial policy, control over the capital flowing, ensuring food and energy
security have been gaining special significance".[_failed verification_]

At the 2007 SCO summit, Iranian Vice President Parviz Davoodi addressed an
initiative that had been garnering greater interest when he said, "The
Shanghai Cooperation Organisation is a good venue for designing a new banking
system which is independent from international banking systems".[_better
source needed_]

President Putin included these comments:

> We now clearly see the defectiveness of the monopoly in world finance and
> the policy of economic selfishness. To solve the current problem Russia will
> take part in changing the global financial structure so that it will be able
> to guarantee stability and prosperity in the world and to ensure progress.  
>  The world is seeing the emergence of a qualitatively different geo-
> political situation, with the emergence of new centers of economic growth
> and political influence.  
>  We will witness and take part in the transformation of the global and
> regional security and development architectures adapted to new realities of
> the 21st century, when stability and prosperity are becoming inseparable
> notions.

Leaders present at the SCO summit in Yekaterinburg, Russia in 2009

In June 2009, at the Yekaterinburg Summit, China announced plans to provide a
US$10 billion loan to other SCO member states to shore up the struggling
economies of its members affected by the 2008 financial crisis. The summit was
held together with the first BRIC summit, and the China–Russia joint statement
said that they want a bigger quota in the International Monetary Fund.

In 2014, the Eurasian Economic Union was founded in which Russia, Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan are members.

During the 2019 Bishkek summit, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan suggested
taking steps to trade in local currencies instead of U.S. dollars and setting
up financial institutions including an SCO bank.

In June 2022, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister for Economic Diplomacy Mehdi
Safari suggested creating a single SCO currency to facilitate trade and
financial transactions among SCO members.

During 19–22 October 2022, Iran hosted SCOCOEX, an international conference
and exhibition on economic cooperation opportunities available to the SCO
member states and partners.

As part of the SCO's economic agenda, it has established a relatively
successful student exchange program called the SCO University.

### Cultural cooperation

Culture ministers of the SCO met for the first time in Beijing on 12 April
2002, signing a joint statement for continued cooperation. The third meeting
of the Culture Ministers took place in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on 27–28 April
2006.

An SCO Arts Festival and Exhibition was held for the first time during the
Astana Summit in 2005. Kazakhstan suggested an SCO folk dance festival to take
place in 2008, in Astana.

### SCO+

The SCO+ forum format was initiated by the United Russia party in October
2020. This format includes inter-party interaction not only of the countries
of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (members, observers, candidates) but
also of the CIS and BRICS countries.

It was first used during the SCO+ international inter-party forum "Economy for
People" on 22–23 October 2020. The forum was attended by speakers from 25
countries, including the chairman of the United Russia party, Dmitry Medvedev,
ministers of the SCO countries, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić, and
ambassadors and diplomats of the CIS and BRICS countries. Russian President
Vladimir Putin sent greetings to the forum participants.

## Summits

According to the Charter of the SCO, summits of the Council of Heads of State
shall be held annually at alternating venues. The locations of these summits
follow the alphabetical order of the member state's name in Russian. The
charter also dictates that the Council of Heads of Government (that is, the
Prime Ministers) shall meet annually in a place decided upon by the council
members. The Council of Foreign Ministers is supposed to hold a summit one
month before the annual summit of Heads of State. Extraordinary meetings of
the Council of Foreign Ministers can be called by any two member states.

## Analysis

### Relations with the West

The United States applied for observer status in the SCO, but was rejected in
2005.

At the Astana summit in July 2005, with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
foreshadowing an indefinite presence of U.S. forces in Uzbekistan and
Kyrgyzstan, the SCO requested the U.S. to set a clear timetable for
withdrawing its troops from SCO member states. Shortly afterwards, Uzbekistan
requested the U.S. leave the K2 air base.

A report in 2007 noted that the SCO has made no direct comments against the
U.S. or its military presence in the region; however, some indirect statements
at the past summits have been viewed by Western media outlets as "thinly
veiled swipes at Washington".

From 2001 to 2008, the Western reaction to the SCO was generally skepticism of
the organization's goals. By the 2010s, however, the West increasingly began
to view the SCO as a potential contributor to stability in the region,
particularly with regards to Afghanistan.

In September 2023, the United Nations approved United Nations resolution
A/77/L.107, titled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization." The result of the vote was 80 in favour to 2
against with 47 abstentions. The United States and Israel were the only
countries to vote against the resolution.

Although the European Council on Foreign Relations dubbed the SCO an "anti
NATO alliance" in 2022, apparent inconsistencies among its member states have
prevented it from becoming an effective geopolitical alliance. As of July
2023, India and Central Asian countries maintained friendly cooperation with
both the West and Russia, India has had fierce conflicts with Pakistan and its
ally China at the same time, which has been limiting the possibility of China
and Russia forming the group into an anti-Western bloc. Academics Simon Curtis
and Ian Klaus write that although SCO has sometimes been compared to NATO,
unlike NATO, SCO does not create a collective security alliance.

### Geopolitical aspects

SCO summit in Ufa, Russia in 2015 SCO and NATO Member States

At a 2005 summit in Kazakhstan the SCO issued a Declaration of Heads of Member
States of the SCO which said: "The heads of the member states point out that,
against the backdrop of a contradictory process of globalisation, multilateral
cooperation, which is based on the principles of equal right and mutual
respect, non-intervention in internal affairs of sovereign states, non-
confrontational way of thinking and consecutive movement towards
democratisation of international relations, contributes to overall peace and
security, and call upon the international community, irrespective of its
differences in ideology and social structure, to form a new concept of
security based on mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality and interaction."

In November 2005 Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that the
"Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is working to establish a rational
and just world order" and that "The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation provides
us with a unique opportunity to take part in the process of forming a
fundamentally new model of geopolitical integration".

In 2007, Matthew Brummer tracked the implications of SCO expansion into the
Persian Gulf.[_full citation needed_] In 2008, one aim of SCO was to ensure
that liberal democracy could not gain ground in these countries, according to
political scientist Thomas Ambrosio. In 2016, political scientist Thomas
Fingar wrote that China took the lead in establishing the Shanghai Five
primarily to limit Russia's ability to reassert its influence in Central Asia.

During the 2008 Russo-Georgian war, China opposed Russia's infringement on
Georgia's sovereignty. Citing principles of sovereignty, territorial
integrity, and global order, China used its influence in the SCO to prevent
the organization from supporting Russia.

In 2008, Iranian writer Hamid Golpira had this to say on the topic: "According
to Zbigniew Brzezinski's theory, control of the Eurasian landmass is the key
to global domination and control of Central Asia is the key to control of the
Eurasian landmass....Russia and China have been paying attention to
Brzezinski's theory, since they formed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
in 2001, ostensibly to curb extremism in the region and enhance border
security, but most probably with the real objective of counterbalancing the
activities of the United States and the rest of the NATO alliance in Central
Asia".

In 2008, the _People's Daily_ wrote: "The Declaration points out that the SCO
member countries have the ability and responsibility to safeguard the security
of the Central Asian region, and calls on Western countries to leave Central
Asia. That is the most noticeable signal given by the Summit to the world".

In January 2023, India as SCO chair, invited Pakistan's Foreign Affairs
Minister and Chief justice to attend a meeting in Goa in May 2023. As of May
2023, India and Pakistan continued to spar over terrorism, while Central Asian
members Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have erupted in armed conflict over border
disputes. The SCO was not a platform for resolving bilateral issues, and its
members were also reluctant to mediate disputes multilaterally. Due to the
widely divergent agendas among member states, Indian commentators even called
it the "Shanghai Contradiction Organisation".

Members of the SCO remained neutral in the Russo-Ukrainian war, they also
strengthened cooperation with the Russian Federation. Analysis in 2024 points
out that the SCO has generally facilitated amicable China-Russia relations.

In June 2025, India refused to endorse a joint statement at the Shanghai
Cooperation Organisation (SCO) defense ministers’ meeting in Qingdao, China,
citing concerns that it did not reflect its position on terrorism. India
objected to the omission of the 22 April 2025 Pahalgam attack, in which 26
Indian tourists were killed, while the statement referenced militant activity
in Balochistan. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh argued that the statement
aligned with Pakistan’s narrative and urged the SCO to hold accountable those
who use “cross-border terrorism as an instrument of policy.” India maintained
that such omissions made the statement unacceptable. India’s foreign ministry
spokesman Randhir Jaiswal expressed that India wanted “concerns on terrorism
to be reflected in the SCO document, which was not acceptable to one
particular country, and therefore the statement was not adopted.”
Subsequently, at the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ Meeting on 15 July
2025, India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar described the Pahalgam
attack as a deliberate attempt to undermine Jammu and Kashmir’s tourism and
incite religious division. He emphasized the need for the SCO to uphold its
founding principles by maintaining an uncompromising stance against terrorism,
separatism, and extremism.

In July 2025, Minister Jaishankar also raised concerns over China’s
construction of the Medog Hydropower Station on the Yarlung Tsangpo River. He
emphasized the potential downstream impacts on water security and ecological
stability, and called for greater transparency, meaningful consultation with
affected countries, and the resumption of suspended hydrological data sharing.

### Other analysis

A 2015 European Parliamentary Research Service paper concludes, "The SCO's
main achievement thus far is to have offered its members a cooperative forum
to balance their conflicting interests and to ease bilateral tensions. It has
built up joint capabilities and has agreed on common approaches in the fight
against terrorism, separatism and extremism. However, major shortcomings, such
as institutional weaknesses, a lack of common financial funds for the
implementation of joint projects and conflicting national interests have
prevented the SCO from achieving a higher level of regional cooperation in
other areas."
