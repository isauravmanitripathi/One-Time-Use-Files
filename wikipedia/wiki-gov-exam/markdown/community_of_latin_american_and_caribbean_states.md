Bloc of Latin American and Caribbean states

The **Community of Latin American and Caribbean States** (**CELAC**) is a bloc
of Latin American and Caribbean states, consisting of 33 countries, and has
five official working languages. It is seen as an alternative to the
Organization of American States (OAS), and includes all OAS member states
(except the United States and Canada) plus includes the nations of Nicaragua
and Cuba. Initially proposed on February 23, 2010, at the Rio Group–Caribbean
Community Unity Summit, CELAC is seen as the successor of the Rio Group and
the Latin American and Caribbean Summit on Integration and Development (CALC).
CELAC was created to deepen Latin American integration and to reduce hegemony
within the politics and economics of the region. The date of creation was on
December 3, 2011, in Caracas, Venezuela, with the signing of the Declaration
of Caracas.

## History

### 2008–2010: Brazil and Mexico initiatives

The immediate predecessor of the CELAC is the Rio Group. Formed in 1986, it
gathered 24 Latin American and Caribbean countries around summits to cooperate
regional policy issue independently of the United States.

On 16–17 December 2008, the I Latin American and Caribbean Summit on
Integration and Development (CALC) took place in Costa do Sauipe, Bahia,
Brazil. It was organized at the initiative of the Lula administration with the
goal of building cooperation mechanism with greater autonomy from the United
States and Canada. Most heads of state from Latin America and the Caribbean
states attended, with the exception of President of Colombia Álvaro Uribe and
President of Peru Alan García. The summit finished with the signing of the
Bahia Declaration, a common agenda establishing the following priorities:
cooperation between mechanism of regional and subregional integration, the
2008 financial crisis, energy, infrastructures, social development and
eradication of hunger and poverty, food security, sustainable development,
natural disasters, human rights promotion, migration, South–South cooperation
and Latin America and Caribbean projection.

In 2008, the Calderón administration of Mexico proposed the creation of the
Latin American and the Caribbean Union (Spanish: _Unión Latinoamericana y del
Caribe_ , ULC). The proposal was formalized on 27 March 2009 at Rio Group
meeting. At the initiative of Mexico, the XXI Rio Summit and the II CALC
summit were held together on 22–23 February 2010 in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.
The joint summit was named the Latin American and Caribbean Unity Summit and
the 33 attending states decided to create the Community of Latin American and
Caribbean States (CELAC), which would be formally established in 2011.

Hugo Chávez, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Rafael Correa were among the other
prominent left-wing leaders who praised the creation of CELAC. In July 2010,
CELAC selected President of Venezuela Hugo Chávez and President of Chile
Sebastián Piñera, as co-chairs of the forum to draft statutes for the
organization.

The announcement prompted debate and discussion across Latin America and the
Caribbean about whether it was more beneficial to have close ties with the
U.S. and Canada or to work independently.

An editorial in Brazil's _Estadão_ newspaper said, "CELAC reflects the
disorientation of the region's governments in relation to its problematic
environment and its lack of foreign policy direction, locked as it is into the
illusion that snubbing the United States will do for Latin American
integration what 200 years of history failed to do."

### 2011: Founding

CELAC's inaugural summit was due to be held in mid-2011, but was postponed
because of the ill-health of Hugo Chávez, president of the host nation,
Venezuela. The summit was instead held on December 2 and 3, 2011, in Caracas.
It primarily focused on the global economic crisis and its effects on the
region. Several leaders, including presidents Cristina Fernández de Kirchner,
Dilma Rousseff and Juan Manuel Santos, encouraged an increase in regional
trade, economic development, and further economic cooperation among members in
order to defend their growing economies.

Chávez, and other leaders such as Rafael Correa and Daniel Ortega, expressed
hope that the bloc would work to further Latin American integration, end U.S.
hegemony and consolidate control over regional affairs. Chávez, citing the
Monroe Doctrine as the original confirmation of U.S. interference in the
region, openly called for CELAC to replace the OAS: "As the years go by, CELAC
is going to leave behind the old and worn-out OAS." Correa called for a new
human rights commission to replace the Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights. Other leaders argued that the organisation should be used as a tool to
resolve regional disagreements and uphold democratic values, but not as a
replacement of the OAS. Santos stated that he would like to see dialogue
within the group over whether existing counter-drug regulations should be
revised. The president of the Latin American Parliament (Parlatino) said he
expects that Parlatino will become the main legislative institution of CELAC.
Amongst the key issues on the agenda were the creation of a "new financial
architecture," sanction for maintaining the legal status of coca in Bolivia
and the rejection of the Cuban embargo by the U.S.

United States President Barack Obama's senior adviser on Latin America, Daniel
Restrepo, informed reporters from Miami that the U.S. government would "watch
and see what direction CELAC takes".

Brazil decided to suspend its participation in the Community of Latin American
and Caribbean States in January 2020 under the administration of Jair
Bolsonaro. Following the 2022 Brazilian general election, newly elected
president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signalled his intention to rejoin the
Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, and effectively did so in
the first days of his administration.

In June 2023, CELAC recognized the Latin American and Caribbean character of
the island of Puerto Rico and “calls on the UN General Assembly to examine the
question of Puerto Rico in its entirety and in all its aspects, and rule on
this matter as soon as possible”.[1].

## Organization

The CELAC has six organs:

  * The summit of Heads of State and Government.
  * The meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs.
  * The meeting of National Coordinators.
  * The _pro tempore_ presidency.
  * The Troika.

The _pro tempore_ presidency is the main representative of the CELAC. The
troika is composed by the current _pro tempore_ presidency, its predecessor,
its successor and the presidency of the CARICOM.

### Forums

The regional body has joint forums that work with external global entities,
including China and the European Union.

#### 2013 Summit – Chile

The EU-LAC Foundation chose CELAC to be the main organization representative
of the relationship between European and Latin American and Caribbean
countries.

#### 2014 Summit – Cuba

During the summit, the region was declared a "peace zone". After three days
and with the approval of participating representatives, a document with 83
focus points was created. It emphasized that, despite cultural and regional
differences, unity between the participating countries is necessary in order
to create progress. "Unity and the integration of our region must be gradually
constructed, with flexibility, with respect to differences, diversity, and the
sovereign right of each of our countries to choose our own forms of political
and economic organization" stated the document. It also states which countries
have been developing the best and how they are doing it in order for them to
be a model for other countries.

The issue of poverty was widely discussed. Cuba's Raúl Castro pointed out that
throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, people wanted a fairer
distribution of wealth, access to affordable education, employment, better
salaries, and the eradication of illiteracy. He argued that CELAC countries
can work together, support each other, to create new plans and solutions for
these problems.

membership in January 2020, alleging that the organization failed to "protect
democracy" in member states. The decision was taken during the presidency of
Jair Bolsonaro, who was himself accused of attacking Brazil's democratic
institutions. Following the 2022 Brazilian general election, newly elected
president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva signalled his intention to rejoin. After
taking office Lula reinstated Brazil's membership into the organization.
