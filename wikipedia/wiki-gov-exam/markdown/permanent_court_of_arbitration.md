The **Permanent Court of Arbitration** (**PCA**) is an intergovernmental
organization headquartered at the Peace Palace, in The Hague, Netherlands.
Unlike a judicial court in the traditional sense, the PCA provides
administrative support in international arbitrations involving various
combinations of States, State entities, international organizations and
private parties. The cases span a range of legal issues involving territorial
and maritime boundaries, sovereignty, human rights, international investment,
and international and regional trade. The PCA is constituted through two
separate multilateral conventions with a combined membership of 125
Contracting Parties. The PCA is not a United Nations agency, but has been a
United Nations observer since 1993.

The PCA was established by the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of
International Disputes, concluded at The Hague in 1899 during the first Hague
Peace Conference of 1899. The Conference had been convened at the initiative
of emperor Nicholas II of Russia "with the object of seeking the most
objective means of ensuring to all peoples the benefits of a real and lasting
peace, and above all, of limiting the progressive development of existing
armaments".

Incident (Italy v. India) Prinsegracht 71, The Hague, a building dating from
about 1728, which was the seat of the PCA between 1901 and 1913, when the
construction of the Peace Palace was completed. North Atlantic Fisheries
Arbitration at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Prinsegracht 71, The Hague,
1910.

The PCA is not a conventional court, but an administrative organization with
the objective of having permanent and readily available means to serve as the
registry for purposes of international arbitration and other related
procedures, including commissions of enquiry and conciliation.

The _Administrative Council_ (formally the _Permanent Administrative Council_)
is a body composed of all the diplomatic representatives of the Contracting
Parties accredited to the Netherlands. It is presided by the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, who is also a Contracting Party. It is
responsible for the "direction and control" of the International Bureau,
directs the organisation's budget and reports on its activities.

The _International Bureau_ is the Secretariat of the PCA and is headed by the
Secretary-General. It provides linguistic, research, administrative and
financial support to PCA arbitration tribunals.

The third organ of the PCA are the _Members of the Court_. Each Contracting
Party may appoint up to four persons "of known competency in questions of
international law, of the highest moral reputation and disposed to accept the
duties of arbitrators" for a renewable 6-year term. In addition to forming a
panel of potential arbitrators, the Members of the Court from each Contracting
Party constitute a “national group,” which is entitled to nominate candidates
for the election to the International Court of Justice. The Members of the
Court (along with the judges of the International Court of Justice) are among
a handful of groups entitled to nominate candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Parties to a dispute may, but are not obliged to, select arbitrators from the
list of the Members of the Court.

The PCA sometimes gets confused with the International Court of Justice, which
also has its seat in the Peace Palace. The PCA is not part of the UN system,
holding observer status in the UN General Assembly since 1993.

## Procedure

In the Articles 30–57 of the Hague Convention of 1899 the rules of arbitration
procedure are outlined. These rules are an adapted version of pre-existing
treaties among the states. They were amended in 1907, the creation of a
summary procedure for simple cases being the most conspicuous change, and were
relevant in the 1920s development of rules for the Court of International
Justice.

The first act of parties before the PCA is the submission of the so-called
"compromisis", stating the issue and the competence of the arbitrator(s).
Proceedings are then conducted in two phases: written pleadings and oral
discussion. The Court retires once the debate is over to deliberate and
conclude the case by a simple majority of votes.

The decision is published as an award, along with any dissenting opinions.
Early Court decisions were countersigned by the arbitrators themselves, but in
1907, that responsibility was passed to the president and secretary (of the
PCA). The award is read in a public session in the presence of the agents and
lawyers of the parties to the case. The decision is binding on the parties,
and there is no mechanism for appeal.

## Budget and fees

Between 2007 and 2008, the budget was €1.8 million.

The budget of the PCA comes from the contributions of its Contracting Parties
and income through arbitration cases. The distribution of the amounts to be
paid by the individual Contracting Parties is based on the system in use by
the Universal Postal Union.

Parties to arbitration have to pay the expenses of the arbitral tribunal set
up to hear the case, including the salary of the arbitrators, registry and
administrative functions, but not including overheads of the organization. The
costs of arbitration vary from case to case and discussions may be held
between the PCA and the parties over fee arrangements.

The fixed costs for action as an appointing authority are €3000.

## Contracting Parties

Parties to the Convention on the Pacific Settlement of disputes of 1899 (71
Parties) and 1907 (101 Parties) are automatically parties to the PCA. As 52
are parties to both conventions, the PCA has 125 Contracting Parties: 123
members of the United Nations, as well as Kosovo and Palestine.

## History

The PCA is the oldest institution for international dispute resolution. It was
established in 1899 by the first Hague Peace Conference under Articles 20 to
29 of the 1899 Hague Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes. At the second Hague Peace Conference, the earlier Convention was
revised by the 1907 Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes. The Conference was convened at the initiative of emperor Nicholas II
of Russia "with the object of seeking the most objective means of ensuring to
all peoples the benefits of a real and lasting peace, and above all, of
limiting the progressive development of existing armaments".

## Functions

PCA tribunals have jurisdiction for disputes based on the PCA founding
documents (the Conventions on Pacific Settlement of International Disputes),
or based on bilateral and multilateral treaties. Its Secretary General
furthermore acts as an appointing authority for arbitration.

### Appointing authority

When problems arise in designating arbitrators for an arbitration under
UNCITRAL arbitration rules (e.g. because one of the parties refuses to
designate an arbitrator, or when the designated arbitrators are unable to
agree on designation of a third arbitrator), the PCA Secretary-General may be
requested to serve as an appointing authority. This option is also open for
other arbitration agreements, in which the Secretary General is designated.
Between 2011, and 2015, 257 of such requests were submitted.

### Interstate arbitration based on the Hague Convention

Arbitration between two states takes place when two member states of the PCA
decide to submit a dispute for arbitration to a PCA Tribunal. The Tribunal
consists of five arbitrators: two (one of whom may be a national of the party
concerned) are selected by each party to the arbitration; these four
arbitrators then choose the fifth and presiding arbitrator.

### Interstate arbitration based on UNCLOS

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) provides for a
dispute resolution mechanism regarding maritime boundaries in which member
states can choose either the

  1. International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
  2. International Court of Justice,
  3. arbitral tribunal (constituted in accordance with Annex VII, UNCLOS)
  4. a special arbitral tribunal (constituted in accordance with Annex VIII).

If two member states have elected different dispute resolution measures, the
third option is to be used. As of August 2016, the PCA has administered twelve
of the thirteen cases initiated by states under Annex VII to the UNCLOS.

### Investor–state investment disputes

Many free trade agreements provide for a mechanism to resolve disputes between
investors and states through arbitration through so-called investor-state
dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses. The PCA may play a role in such proceedings
as appointing authority for arbitrators, by use of its arbitration rules or by
providing support to the arbitration case.
