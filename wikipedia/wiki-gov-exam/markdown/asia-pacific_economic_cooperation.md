Economic forum of Asia–Pacific nations

**Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation** (**APEC** /ˈeɪpɛk/ _AY -pek_) is an
inter-governmental forum for 21 member economies in the Pacific Rim that
promotes free trade throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Following the success
of ASEAN's series of post-ministerial conferences launched in the mid-1980s,
APEC started in 1989, in response to the growing interdependence of Asia-
Pacific economies and the advent of regional trade blocs in other parts of the
world; it aimed to establish new markets for agricultural products and raw
materials beyond Europe. Headquartered in Singapore, APEC is recognized as one
of the highest-level multilateral blocs and oldest forums in the Asia-Pacific
/ Americas region, and exerts significant global influence.

The heads of government of all APEC members except Taiwan (which is
represented by a ministerial-level official as _economic leader_) attend an
annual APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting. The location of the meeting rotates
annually among the member economies, and a famous tradition, followed for most
(but not all) summits, involves the attending leaders dressing in a national
costume of the host country. APEC has three official observers: the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations Secretariat, the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. APEC's Host
Economy of the Year is considered to be invited in the first place for
geographical representation to attend G20 meetings following G20 guidelines.

## History

ABC news report of the first APEC meeting in Canberra, November 1989,
featuring delegates watching the Melbourne Cup

The initial inspiration for APEC came when the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN)'s series of post-ministerial conferences, launched in the
mid-1980s, had demonstrated the feasibility and value of regular conferences
among ministerial-level representatives of both developed and developing
economies. By 1986, the post-ministerial conferences had expanded to embrace
12 members (the then six members of ASEAN and its six dialogue partners). The
developments led Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke to believe in the
necessity of region-wide co-operation on economic matters. In January 1989,
Bob Hawke called for more effective economic co-operation across the Pacific
Rim region. This led to the first meeting of APEC in the Australian capital of
Canberra in November, chaired by  Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth
Evans. Attended by ministers from twelve countries, the meeting concluded with
commitments to hold future annual meetings in Singapore and South Korea. Ten
months later, representatives of 12 Asia-Pacific economies met in Canberra,
Australia, to establish APEC. The APEC Secretariat, based in Singapore, was
established to co-ordinate the activities of the organisation.

During the 1994 meeting in Bogor, Indonesia, APEC leaders adopted the **Bogor
Goals** , which aimed for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-
Pacific by 2010 for industrialised economies and by 2020 for developing
economies. During the November 1995 Ministerial Meeting in Osaka, Japan, a
business advisory body named the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC)
composed of three business executives from each member-country was agreed to
be established in 1996.

In April 2001, APEC, in collaboration with five other international
organisations (Eurostat, International Energy Agency, Organización
Latinoamericana de Energía (OLADE) [es], Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries and the United Nations Statistics Division) launched the
Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the Joint Organisations Data
Initiative (JODI).

## Member economies

Currently, APEC has 21 members. The criterion for membership, however, is that
each member must be an independent economic entity, rather than a sovereign
state. APEC also includes three official observers: ASEAN, the Pacific Islands
Forum and the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council.

## Possible enlargement

Current members

Announced interest in membership

India has requested membership in APEC, and received initial support from the
United States, South Korea, Australia, and Papua New Guinea. Officials have
decided not to allow India to join for various reasons, including the fact
that India does not border the Pacific Ocean, which all current members do.
However, India was invited to be an observer for the first time in November
2011.

Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Macau, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Costa Rica,
Colombia, Panama, and Ecuador, are among a dozen other economies that have
applied for membership in APEC. Colombia applied for APEC's membership as
early as in 1995, but its bid was halted as the organisation stopped accepting
new members from 1993 to 1996, and the moratorium was further prolonged to
2007 due to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

## Business facilitation

As a regional organization, APEC has always played a leading role in the area
of reform initiatives in the area of business facilitation. The APEC Trade
Facilitation Action Plan (TFAPI) has contributed to a reduction of 6% in the
cost of business transactions across the region between 2002 and 2006.
According to APEC's projections, the cost of conducting business transactions
will be reduced by another 5% between 2007 and 2010. To this end, a new Trade
Facilitation Action Plan has been endorsed. According to a 2008 research brief
published by the World Bank as part of its Trade Costs and Facilitation
Project, increasing transparency in the region's trading system is critical if
APEC is to meet its Bogor Goal targets. The APEC Business Travel Card, a
travel document for visa-free business travel within the region is one of the
concrete measures to facilitate business. In May 2010 Russia joined the
scheme, thus completing the circle.

### Proposed FTAAP

APEC first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the
Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) at its summit in 2006 in Hanoi. However, the proposal for
such an area has been around since at least 1966 and Japanese economist
Kiyoshi Kojima [ja]'s proposal for a Pacific Free Trade agreement. While it
gained little traction, the idea led to the formation of Pacific Trade and
Development Conference and then the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council in
1980 and then APEC in 1989.

In the wake of the 2006 summit, economist C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free
Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the
proposed parties to any agreement at that time. His ideas convinced the APEC
Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, ASEAN and
existing free trade agreement (FTA) partners negotiated the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), not officially including Russia.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without China or Russia involved became
the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing
in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion. President Obama hosted a TPP
meeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.

The proposal for a FTAAP arose due to the lack of progress in the Doha round
of World Trade Organization negotiations, and as a way to overcome the "noodle
bowl" effect created by overlapping and conflicting elements of the copious
free trade agreements – there were approximately 60 free trade agreements in
2007, with an additional 117 in the process of negotiation in Southeast Asia
and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2012, ASEAN+6 countries alone had 339 free
trade agreements – many of which were bilateral.

The FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself
to reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that
would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region. The
economic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other
regional free trade areas such as the ASEAN Plus Three (ASEAN + China, South
Korea and Japan). Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within
APEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications
with nations of other regions. The development of the FTAAP is expected to
take many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations
between member economies. It is also affected by the absence of political will
and popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.

At the 2014 APEC summit in Beijing, APEC leaders agreed to launch "a
collective strategic study" on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake
the study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016. APEC
Executive Director Alan Bollard revealed in the Elite Talk show that FTAAP
will be APEC's big goal out into the future.

The Trans-Pacific Partnership included 12 of the 21 APEC members and had
provisions for the accession of other APEC members, five of which expressed
interest in membership.

## APEC Study Centre Consortium

In 1993, APEC Leaders decided to establish a network of APEC Study Centres
(APCs) among universities and research institutions in member economies. The
purpose is to foster cooperation among tertiary and research institutes of
member economies, thus having better academic collaboration on key regional
economic challenges. To encourage independence from the APEC conference, the
APCs are funded independently and choose their own research topics.

As of December 2018, there are 70 APCs among the member economies. An annual
conference is usually held in the host economy for that year.

## APEC Business Advisory Council

The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) was created by the APEC Economic
Leaders in November 1995 with the aim of providing advice to the APEC Economic
Leaders on ways to achieve the Bogor Goals and other specific business sector
priorities, and to provide the business perspective on specific areas of co-
operation.

Each economy nominates up to three members from the private sector to ABAC.
These business leaders represent a wide range of industry sectors. ABAC
provides an annual report to APEC Economic Leaders containing recommendations
to improve the business and investment environment in the Asia-Pacific region,
and outlining business views about priority regional issues. ABAC is also the
only non-governmental organisation that is on the official agenda of the APEC
Economic Leader's Meeting.

Summary video of the APEC Philippines 1996 Meeting

Since its formation in 1989, APEC has held annual meetings with
representatives from all member economies. The first four annual meetings were
attended by ministerial-level officials. Beginning in 1993, the annual
meetings are named APEC Economic Leaders' Meetings and are attended by the
heads of government from all member economies except Taiwan, which is
represented by a ministerial-level official.

### Meeting developments

In 1997, the APEC meeting was held in Vancouver. Controversy arose after
officers of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police used pepper spray against
protesters. The protesters objected to the presence of autocratic leaders such
as Indonesian president Suharto.

At the 2001 Leaders' Meeting in Shanghai, APEC leaders pushed for a new round
of trade negotiations and support for a program of trade capacity-building
assistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks
later. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United
States, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and
capacity building. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and
implement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade transaction costs in the
Asia-Pacific region by five percent over five years, and pursue trade
liberalisation policies relating to information technology goods and services.

In 2003, Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Isamuddin had planned to attack the
APEC Leaders Meeting to be held in Bangkok in October. He was captured in the
city of Ayutthaya, Thailand by Thai police on 11 August 2003, before he could
finish planning the attack.

Chile became the first South American nation to host the Leaders' Meeting in
2004. The agenda of that year was focused on terrorism and commerce, small and
medium enterprise development, and contemplation of free agreements and
regional trade agreements.

The 2005 Leaders' Meeting was held in Busan, South Korea. The meeting focused
on the Doha round of World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, leading up
to the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005 held in Hong Kong in December. Weeks
earlier, trade negotiations in Paris were held between several WTO members,
including the United States and the European Union, centred on reducing
agricultural trade barriers. APEC leaders at the summit urged the European
Union to agree to reduce farm subsidies. In a continuation of the climate
information sharing initiative established by the APEC Climate Network working
group, it was decided by the leaders to install the APEC Climate Center in
Busan. Peaceful protests against APEC were staged in Busan, but the meeting
schedule was not affected.

At the Leaders' Meeting held on 19 November 2006 in Hanoi, APEC leaders called
for a new start to global free-trade negotiations while condemning terrorism
and other threats to security. APEC also criticised North Korea for conducting
a nuclear test and a missile test launch that year, urging the country to take
"concrete and effective" steps toward nuclear disarmament. Concerns about
nuclear proliferation in the region was discussed in addition to economic
topics. The United States and Russia signed an agreement as part of Russia's
bid to join the World Trade Organization.

The APEC Australia 2007 Leaders' Meeting was held in Sydney from 2–9 September
2007. The political leaders agreed to an "aspirational goal" of a 25%
reduction of energy intensity correlative with economic development. Extreme
security measures including airborne sharpshooters and extensive steel-and-
concrete barricades were deployed against anticipated protesters and potential
terrorists. However, protest activities were peaceful and the security
envelope was penetrated with ease by a spoof diplomatic motorcade manned by
members of the Australian television program _The Chaser_ , one of whom was
dressed to resemble the Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.

The APEC Chile 2019, originally to be held 16–17 November 2019 in Chile, was
cancelled due to ongoing protests by sections of its population over
inequality, the cost of living and police repression.

The 2023 APEC meeting was notable for a lack of consensuses of group members
on their stance over the Russia–Ukraine and Gaza conflicts as well as
consensus for WTO reforms. The meeting between Biden and Xi was also seen as
significant in terms of reducing tensions between the US and China.

### APEC leaders' group photo

At the end of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, the leaders gather for the
official APEC Leaders' Family Photo. A tradition has the leaders dressing to
reflect the culture of the host member. The tradition dates to the first such
meeting in 1993 when then-U.S. President Bill Clinton insisted on informal
attire and gave the leaders leather bomber jackets. At the 2010 meeting, Japan
had the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional kimono.
Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC
meeting, U.S. President Barack Obama joked that he looked forward to seeing
the leaders dressed in "flowered shirts and grass skirts". After viewing
previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in aloha shirts
might give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama
instead decided it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a
specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not expected to wear it for
the photo. Leaders in Bali, Indonesia at the 2013 conference wore a batik
outfit; in China 2014 Tang suit jackets; in the Philippines 2015 barong
tagalogs; in Peru 2016 vicuña wool shawls; in 2017 Vietnamese silk shirts.

## Criticism

APEC has been criticised for promoting free trade agreements that would impose
restrictions on national and local laws, which regulate and ensure labour
rights, environmental protection and safe and affordable access to medicine.
According to the organisation, it is "the premier forum for facilitating
economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region"
established to "further enhance economic growth and prosperity for the region
and to strengthen the Asia-Pacific community". The effectiveness and fairness
of its role has been questioned, especially from the viewpoints of European
countries that cannot take part in APEC and Pacific Island nations that cannot
participate but stand to be affected by its decisions.
