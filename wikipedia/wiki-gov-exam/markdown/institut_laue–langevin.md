Institut Laue-Langevin

The **Institut Laue–Langevin** (**ILL**) is an internationally financed
scientific facility, situated on the Polygone Scientifique in Grenoble,
France. It is one of the world centres for research using neutrons. Founded in
1967 and honouring the physicists Max von Laue and Paul Langevin, the ILL
provides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most
intense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5×1015
neutrons per second per cm2, with a thermal power of typically 58.3
MW.[_citation needed_]

The ILL neutron scattering facilities allow the analysis of the structure of
conducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the
measurement of stresses in mechanical materials. It also allows investigations
into macromolecular assemblies, particularly protein dynamics and biomolecular
structure. It is a world-renowned centre for nanoscale science.[_citation

## History

Water input for ESRF, CNRS and ILL on the river Drac Inside the reactor hall

The institute was founded by France and Germany, with the United Kingdom
becoming the third major partner in 1973. These partner states provide,
through Research Councils, the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have
since become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may
apply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other
countries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific
council involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for
researchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is
charged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750
experiments are completed every year, in fields including magnetism,
superconductivity, materials engineering, and the study of liquids, colloids
and biological substances such as proteins. [_citation needed_]

The high-flux research reactor produces neutrons through fission in a compact-
core fuel element. Neutron moderators cool the neutrons to wavelengths usable
experimentally. Neutrons are then directed at a suite of instruments to probe
the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic
neutron scattering, and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the
neutron. Fission products and gamma rays produced by nuclear reactions in the
reactor core are also used by the instrument suite.

In 2000 began the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The
first phase has already resulted in a 17-fold gains in performance. The second
phase started in 2008: it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the
upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.[_citation

The ILL shares its site, the 'epn science campus', with other institutions
including the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) and the European
Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and the Unit for Viral Host Cell
Interactions (UVHCI). The French Institut de Biologie Structural (IBS) joined
the campus in 2013.

In 2019, researchers unravelled information about a protein causing
progressive diseases.

In summer 2016 the Institut Laue–Langevin demonstrated that a molecule called
ectoine is used by Halomonas titanicae near the wreck of RMS Titanic to
survive the osmotic pressure that salt water causes on their membranes.

## Awards and recognitions

The physicist Duncan Haldane who worked at the institute from 1977 to 1981
received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2016 with Michael Kosterlitz and David
J. Thouless for their work on the transitions of topological phases in the
material.

Rudolf Mössbauer, Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, succeeded Heinz Maier-
Leibnitz in 1972 as the director of the institute.

The physicist Philippe Nozières, who worked at the institute from 1972 until
his retirement, received the Wolf Prize in 1985, together with Conyers
Herring, for their major contributions to the fundamental theory of solids,
especially the behaviour of electrons in metals.
