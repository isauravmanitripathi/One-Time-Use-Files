Scientists work in a laboratory at the International Livestock Research
Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.

The **International Livestock Research Institute** or **ILRI** is an
international agricultural research institute within the CGIAR – formerly the
Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research. It was established
in 1994 by merger of the International Laboratory for Research on Animal
Diseases in Nairobi in Kenya, and the International Livestock Centre for
Africa in Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. It is a non-profit, non-governmental
organisation.

Its research is intended to help to build sustainable livestock pathways out
of poverty in low-income countries and to help people in those countries to
keep their farm animals alive and productive, to increase and sustain their
livestock and farm productivity, and to find profitable markets for their
animal products.[_self-published source?_] Research covers five broad areas:
