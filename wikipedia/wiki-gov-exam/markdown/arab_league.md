The **Arab League** (Arabic: الجامعة العربية, __al-Jāmiʿa al-ʻArabiyya__
[al.d͡ʒaː.mi.ʕa al.ʕa.ra.bij.ja] ⓘ), officially the **League of Arab States**
(Arabic: جامعة الدول العربية, __Jāmiʿat ad-Duwal al-ʿArabiyya__), is a
regional organization in the Arab world. The Arab League was formed in Cairo
on 22 March 1945, initially with seven members: Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan,
Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and North Yemen. Currently, the League has 22
members.

The League's main goal is to "draw closer the relations between member states
and co-ordinate collaboration between them, to safeguard their independence
and sovereignty, and to consider in a general way the affairs and interests of
the Arab countries". The organization has received a relatively low level of
cooperation throughout its history.

Through institutions, notably the Arab League Educational, Cultural and
Scientific Organization (ALECSO) and the Economic and Social Council of its
Council of Arab Economic Unity (CAEU), the League facilitates political,
economic, cultural, scientific, and social programmes designed to promote the
interests of the Arab world. It has served as a forum for the member states to
coordinate policy, arrange studies of and committees as to matters of common
concern, settle inter-state disputes and limit conflicts such as the 1958
Lebanon crisis. The League has served as a platform for the drafting and
conclusion of many landmark documents promoting economic integration. One
example is the Joint Arab Economic Action Charter, which outlines the
principles for economic activities in the region.

Each member state has one vote in the Council of the Arab League, and
decisions are binding only for those states that have voted for them. The aims
of the league in 1945 were to strengthen and coordinate the political,
cultural, economic and social programs of its members and to mediate disputes
among them or between them and third parties. Furthermore, the signing of an
agreement on _Joint Defence and Economic Cooperation_ on 13 April 1950
committed the signatories to coordination of military defence measures. In
March 2015, the Arab League General Secretary announced the establishment of a
Joint Arab Force with the aim of counteracting extremism and other threats to
the Arab States. The decision was reached while Operation Decisive Storm was
intensifying in Yemen. Participation in the project is voluntary, and the army
intervenes only at the request of one of the member states. Existing military
cooperation between Arab league states and regional civil wars and terrorist
threats were the impetuses for JAF's establishment.

In the early 1970s, the Economic Council put forward a proposal to create the
Joint Arab Chambers of Commerce across international states. That led to the
setting up of mandates to promote, encourage and facilitate bilateral trade
between the Arab world and significant trading partners.

## History

Following adoption of the Alexandria Protocol in 1944, the Arab League was
founded on 22 March 1945. The official headquarters of the League was the
Boustan Palace in Cairo. It aimed to be a regional organisation of Arab states
with a focus to developing the economy, resolving disputes and coordinating
political aims. Other countries later joined the league. Each country was
given one vote in the council. The first major action was joint intervention
to keep Palestine from being divided into two states in keeping with the
decision of the United Nations General Assembly. When Transjordan agreed to
this proposal, Egypt intervened to prevent this from happening. It was
followed by the creation of a mutual defence treaty two years later. A common
market was established in 1965.

Jordan, Lebanese Republic and Palestine

The Arab League has not achieved much cooperation throughout its history.
According to Michael Barnett and Etel Solingen, the design of the Arab League
reflects Arab leaders' individual concerns for regime survival: "the politics
of Arab nationalism and a shared identity led Arab states to embrace the
rhetoric of Arab unity in order to legitimize their regimes, and to fear Arab
unity in practice because it would impose greater restrictions on their
sovereignty." The Arab League was "specifically designed to fail at producing
the kind of greater collaboration and integration that might have weakened
political leaders at home."

## Geography

Joining dates of member states; the Comoros (circled) joined in 1993.  
1940s  1950s  1960s  1970s

The Arab League member states cover over 13,000,000 km2 (5,000,000 sq mi) and
straddles two continents: Africa and Asia. The area largely consists of arid
deserts, such as the Sahara. Nevertheless, it also contains several highly
fertile lands like the Nile Valley, the Jubba Valley and Shebelle Valley in
the Horn of Africa, the Atlas Mountains in the Maghreb, and the Fertile
Crescent that stretches over Mesopotamia and the Levant. The area comprises
deep forests in southern Arabia and parts of the world's longest river, the
Nile.

## Membership

The Charter of the Arab League, also known as the Pact of the League of Arab
States, is the founding treaty of the Arab League. Adopted in 1945, it
stipulates that "the League of Arab States shall be composed of the
independent Arab States that have signed this Pact."

In 1945, there were seven members, but the Arab League now has 22 members,
including 10 African countries:

  * Algeria
  * Bahrain
  * Comoros
  * Djibouti
  * Egypt
  * Iraq
  * Jordan
  * Kuwait
  * Lebanon
  * Libya
  * Mauritania
  * Morocco
  * Oman
  * Palestine
  * Qatar
  * Saudi Arabia
  * Somalia
  * Sudan
  * Syria
  * Tunisia
  * United Arab Emirates
  * Yemen

and 7 observer states (note: the observer states below have been invited to
participate during select Arab League sessions but do not hold voting
privileges):

  * Armenia
  * Brazil
  * Chad
  * Eritrea
  * Greece
  * India
  * Venezuela

### Suspensions

Egypt was suspended from the Arab League on 26 March 1979 due to the
Egypt–Israel peace treaty, with the League's headquarters moving from Cairo to
Tunis, Tunisia. In 1987, Arab League states restored diplomatic relations with
Egypt, the country was readmitted to the League in May 1989 and the League's
headquarters were moved back to Cairo in September 1990.

Libya was suspended on 22 February 2011, following the outbreak of the first
Libyan civil war. The Arab League voted to restore Libya's membership on 27
August 2011 by accrediting a representative of the National Transitional
Council, which was the partially recognised interim government of the country.

Syria was suspended on 16 November 2011 in the aftermath of the outbreak of
the Syrian civil war. On 6 March 2013, the Arab League gave Syria's seat in
the Arab League to the Syrian National Coalition, the largest opposition
group. On 9 March 2014, secretary general Nabil Elaraby stated that Syria's
seat would remain vacant until the opposition completed the formation of its
institutions. In 2021, the Arab League initiated a process of normalisation
between the Syrian Ba'athist government and other Arab nations. On 7 May 2023,
at the meeting of the Council of the Arab League in Cairo, it was agreed to
reinstate Syria's membership.

The Arab League is a political organization which tries to help integrate its
members economically, and solve conflicts involving member states without
asking for foreign assistance. It possesses elements of a state representative
parliament while foreign affairs are often conducted under UN supervision.

The Charter of the Arab League endorsed the principle of an Arab nation-state
while respecting the sovereignty of the individual member states. The internal
regulations of the Council of the League and the committees were agreed in
October 1951. Those of the Secretariat-General were agreed in May 1953.

Since then, governance of the Arab League has been based on the duality of
supra-national institutions and the sovereignty of the member states.
Preservation of individual statehood derived its strengths from the natural
preference of ruling elites to maintain their power and independence in
decision making. Moreover, the fear of the richer that the poorer may share
their wealth in the name of Arab nationalism, the feuds among Arab rulers, and
the influence of external powers that might oppose Arab unity can be seen as
obstacles towards a deeper integration of the league.

Mindful of their previous announcements in support of the Arabs of Palestine
the framers of the Pact were determined to include them within the League from
its inauguration. This was done by means of an annex that declared:

> Even though Palestine was not able to control her own destiny, it was on the
> basis of the recognition of her independence that the Covenant of the League
> of Nations determined a system of government for her. Her existence and her
> independence among the nations can, therefore, no more be questioned _de
> jure_ than the independence of any of the other Arab States. [...]
> Therefore, the States signatory to the Pact of the Arab League consider that
> in view of Palestine's special circumstances, the Council of the League
> should designate an Arab delegate from Palestine to participate in its work
> until this country enjoys actual independence

In September 1963, the Arab League appointed Ahmad Shukeiri as Representative
of Palestine at the Arab League. At the Cairo Summit of 1964, the Arab League
initiated the creation of an organisation representing the Palestinian people.
The first Palestinian National Council convened in East Jerusalem on 29 May
1964. The Palestine Liberation Organization was founded during this meeting on
2 June 1964. Palestine was shortly admitted in to the Arab League, represented
by the PLO. Today, State of Palestine is a full member of the Arab League.

At the Beirut Summit on 28 March 2002, the league adopted the Arab Peace
Initiative, a Saudi-inspired peace plan for the Arab–Israeli conflict. The
initiative offered full normalisation of the relations with Israel. In
exchange, Israel was required to withdraw from all occupied territories,
including the Golan Heights, to recognise Palestinian independence in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, as well as a "just
solution" for the Palestinian refugees. The Peace Initiative was again
endorsed at 2007 in the Riyadh Summit. In July 2007, the Arab League sent a
mission, consisting of the Jordanian and Egyptian foreign ministers, to Israel
to promote the initiative. Following Venezuela's move to expel Israeli
diplomats amid the 2008–2009 Israel–Gaza conflict, Kuwaiti member of
parliament Waleed Al-Tabtabaie proposed moving Arab League headquarters to
Caracas, Venezuela. On 13 June 2010, Amr Mohammed Moussa, Secretary-General of
the Arab League, visited the Gaza Strip, the first visit by an official of the
Arab League since Hamas' armed takeover in 2007.

The Arab League is a member of the China-Arab States Cooperation Forum
(CASCF), which was formed in 2004. CASCF is the Arab League's earliest
participation in a cooperation forum with another country or region. CASCF is
the primarily multi-lateral coordination mechanism between the Arab states and
China and within CASCF the Arab League represents its member states as a
relatively unified force. The Arab League's coordination allows Arab states to
negotiate actively for collective projects involving multiple states, such as
railway projects, nuclear power projects, and Dead Sea initiatives.

In 2015, the Arab League voiced support for Saudi Arabian-led military
intervention in Yemen against the Shia Houthis and forces loyal to former
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was deposed in the 2011 uprising.

On 15 April 2018, in response to the Turkish invasion of northern Syria aimed
at ousting U.S.-backed Syrian Kurds from the enclave of Afrin, the Arab League
passed a resolution calling on Turkish forces to withdraw from Afrin.

In September 2019, the Arab League condemned Benjamin Netanyahu's plans to
annex the eastern portion of the occupied West Bank known as the Jordan
Valley.

The Arab League met in Cairo on 12 October 2019 to discuss Turkish offensive
into north-eastern Syria. Upon meeting, its member states voted to condemn the
Turkish offensive, dubbing it both an 'invasion' and an 'aggression' against
an Arab state, adding that the organization saw it as a violation of
international law.

On 9 September 2020, the Arab League refused to condemn the UAE's decision to
normalize ties with Israel. Nevertheless, "The goal all our Arab countries
seek, without exception, is to end the occupation and establish an independent
Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital,"
Aboul Gheit said. In January 2024, the Arab League expressed support for South
Africa's ICJ genocide case against Israel.

## Military

The Joint Defence Council of the Arab League is one of the Institutions of the
Arab League. It was established under the terms of the Joint Defence and
Economic Co-operation Treaty of 1950 to coordinate the joint defence of the
Arab League member states.

The Arab League as an organisation has no military Force, similar to the UN,
but at the 2007 summit, the Leaders decided to reactivate their joint defence
and establish a peacekeeping force to deploy in South Lebanon, Darfur, Iraq,
and other hot spots.

At a 2015 summit in Egypt, member states agreed in principle to form a joint
military force.

## Economic resources

The Arab League is rich in resources, such as enormous oil and natural gas
resources in certain member states.

Economic achievements initiated by the League amongst member states have been
less impressive than those achieved by smaller Arab organisations such as the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Among them is the Arab Gas Pipeline, that will
transport Egyptian and Iraqi gas to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Turkey. As of
2013, a significant difference in economic conditions exist between the
developed oil states of Algeria, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE, and developing
countries like the Comoros, Djibouti, Mauritania, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

OAPEC Members

The Arab League also includes great fertile lands in the southern part of
Sudan. It is referred to as the food basket of the Arab World, the region's
instability including the independence of South Sudan has not affected its
tourism industry, that is considered the fastest growing industry in the
region, with Egypt, UAE, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Jordan leading the way. Another
industry that is growing steadily in the Arab League is telecommunications.

Economical achievements within members have been low in the league's history,
other smaller Arab Organizations have achieved more than the league has, such
as the GCC, but lately several major economic projects that are promising are
to be completed, the Arab Gas Pipeline is to end by 2010, Connecting Egyptian
and Iraqi Gas to Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, and then to Turkey thus Europe, a
free trade Agreement (GAFTA) is to be completed by 1 January 2008, making 95%
of all Arab products tax free of customs.

### Transport

The Arab League is divided into five parts when it comes to transport, with
the Arabian Peninsula and the Near East being entirely connected by air, sea,
roads and railways. Another part of the League is the Nile Valley, made up of
Egypt and Sudan. These two member states have started to improve the River
Nile's navigation system to improve accessibility and thus foster trading. A
new railway system is also set to connect the southern Egyptian city of Abu
Simbel with the northern Sudanese city of Wadi Halfa and then to Khartoum and
Port Sudan. The third division of the League is the Maghreb, where a 3,000 km
stretch of railway runs from the southern cities of Morocco to Tripoli in
Western Libya. The fourth division of the League is the Horn of Africa, whose
member states include Djibouti and Somalia. These two Arab League states are
separated by only ten nautical miles from the Arabian Peninsula by the Bab el
Mandeb and this is quickly changing as Tarik bin Laden, the brother of Osama
bin Laden, has initiated the construction of the ambitious Bridge of the Horns
project, which ultimately aims to connect the Horn of Africa with the Arabian
Peninsula via a massive bridge. The project is intended to facilitate and
accelerate the already centuries-old trade and commerce between the two
regions. The last division of the League is the isolated archipelago of the
Comoros located off the coast of East Africa, which is not physically
connected to any other Arab state, but still trades with other Arab League
members.

## Literacy

In collecting literacy data, many countries estimate the number of literate
people based on self-reported data. Some use educational attainment data as a
proxy, but measures of school attendance or grade completion may differ.
Because definitions and data collection methods vary across countries,
literacy estimates should be used with caution. United Nations Development
Programme, Human Development Report 2010\. The Persian Gulf region has had an
oil boom, enabling more schools and universities to be set up.

Rank | Country | Literacy rate   
---|---|---  
1 |  Qatar | 97.3   
2 |  Palestine | 96.5   
3 |  Kuwait | 96.3

## Demographics

While Egyptians constitute the largest ethnic group in the Arab League, there
are several other ethnic groups that also reside in the region, including
Arabs, Berbers, Kurds, Somalis, Assyrians, Armenians, Nubians, Mandaeans, and
Circassians. Each of these groups have their own distinct cultures, languages,
and traditions. As of 1 July 2013, about 359 million people live in the states
of the Arab League. Its population grows faster than in most other global
regions. The most populous member state is Egypt, with a population of over
100 million. The least populated is the Comoros, with approximately 850,000
inhabitants.

### Religion

The majority of the Arab League's citizens adhere to Islam, with Christianity
being the second largest religion. At least 15 million Christians combined
live in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Syria. In addition,
there are smaller but significant numbers of Druze, Yazidis, Shabaks and
Mandaeans. Numbers for nonreligious Arabs are generally not available, but
research by the Pew Forum suggests around 1% of people in the MENA region are
"unaffiliated".

### Languages

The official language of the Arab League is Literary Arabic, based on
Classical Arabic. However, several Arab League member states have other co-
official or national languages, such as Somali, Afar, Comorian, French,
English, Berber and Kurdish. In most countries, there is a dominant non-
codified spoken Arabic dialect.

## Culture

### Sports

The Pan-Arab Games are considered the biggest Arab sporting event, which
brings together athletes from all the Arab countries to participate in a
variety of different sports.

The Union of Arab Football Associations organises the Arab Cup (for national
teams) and the Arab Club Champions Cup (for clubs). Arab sport federations
also exist for several games, include basketball, volleyball, handball, table
tennis, tennis, squash and swimming.[_citation needed_]
