Intergovernmental organisation of island nations in the Pacific Ocean

The **Pacific Islands Forum** (**PIF**) is an inter-governmental organisation
that aims to enhance cooperation among countries and territories of Oceania,
including formation of a trade bloc and regional peacekeeping operations. It
was founded in 1971 as the **South Pacific Forum** (**SPF**), and changed its
name in 1999 to "Pacific Islands Forum", so as to be more inclusive of the
Forum's Oceania-spanning membership of both north and south Pacific island
countries, including Australia and New Zealand.

The mission of the Pacific Islands Forum is "to work in support of Forum
member governments, to enhance the economic and social well-being of the
people of the South Pacific by fostering cooperation between governments and
between international agencies, and by representing the interests of Forum
members in ways agreed by the Forum". Its decisions are implemented by the
_Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat_ (PIFS), which grew out of the _South
Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation_ (SPEC). As well as its role in
harmonising regional positions on various political and policy issues, the
Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport
and trade. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General is the permanent
Chairman of the Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific (CROP).

Australia and New Zealand are generally larger and wealthier than the other
countries that make up the rest of the Forum, with Australia's population
being around twice that of the other members combined and its economy being
more than five times larger. They are significant aid donors and big markets
for exports from the other island countries. Military and police forces as
well as civilian personnel of Forum states, chiefly Australia and New Zealand,
have recently been part of regional peacekeeping and stabilisation operations
in other states, notably in Solomon Islands (2003–) and Nauru (2004–2009),
under Forum auspices. Such regional efforts are mandated by the Biketawa
Declaration, which was adopted at the 31st Summit of Pacific Islands Forum
Leaders, held at Kiribati in October 2000. The 50th meeting of the Forum took
place in Tuvalu in August 2019. In February 2021, Palau announced that it
would be leaving the Pacific Islands Forum after a dispute regarding Henry
Puna's election as the Forum's secretary-general. The Federated States of
Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Nauru also decided to leave
the Forum after Palau's decision. In February 2022, it was announced that the
departure process had been paused, pending proposed reforms. However, on 9
July 2022 Kiribati confirmed its withdrawal. On 30 January 2023, Prime
Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka confirmed that Kiribati had reconciled with
the Pacific Islands Forum and planned to rejoin soon. Rabuka met Kiribati
president Taneti Mamau who informed Rabuka of the decision.

The larger Pacific Community functions mainly to promote international
development by providing technical and scientific advice and funding
development projects, and does not consider security issues or function as a
trade bloc.

## History

South Pacific Forum, 5 August 1971, Wellington

The Forum grew out of a proposal from Cook Islander Premier Albert Henry for a
political forum to work alongside the existing South Pacific Commission. The
idea was supported by other newly-independent island nations, and they agreed
to meet to discuss a permanent body. The first meeting of the South Pacific
Forum was initiated by New Zealand and held in Wellington, New Zealand, from
5–7 August 1971 with attendants of the following seven countries: the
President of Nauru, the Prime Ministers of Western Samoa, Tonga and Fiji, the
Premier of the Cook Islands, the Australian Minister for External Territories,
and the Prime Minister of New Zealand. It was a private and informal
discussion of a wide range of issues of common concern, concentrating on
matters directly affecting the daily lives of the people of the islands of the
South Pacific, devoting particular attention to trade, shipping, tourism, and
education. Afterwards this meeting was held annually in member countries and
areas in turn. In 1999, the 30th session decided to rename the organisation to
the Pacific Islands Forum, to better account for areas outside the south
Pacific. Immediately after the forum's annual meeting at head of government
level, the Post Forum Dialogue (PFD) is conducted at ministerial level with
PFD development partners around the world.

### Suspension of Fiji

In August 2008, the Forum threatened to suspend Fiji if the latter did not
commit to holding a general election by March 2009. Subsequently, at a special
leaders' meeting of the Pacific Islands Forum held in Papua New Guinea in
January 2009, Forum leaders set a deadline of 1 May, by which date Fiji must
set a date for elections before the end of the year. Fiji rejected the
deadline. Consequently, on 2 May, Fiji was suspended indefinitely from
participation in the Forum with immediate effect. Toke Talagi, the Chair of
the Pacific Islands Forum and Premier of Niue, described the suspension as
"also particularly timely given the recent disturbing deterioration of the
political, legal and human rights situation in Fiji since April 10, 2009". He
described Fiji as "a regime which displays such a total disregard for basic
human rights, democracy and freedom" which he believed contravened membership
of the Pacific Islands Forum. Talagi emphasised, however, that Fiji had not
been expelled and that it would be welcomed back into the fold when it
returned to the path of "constitutional democracy, through free and fair
elections".

The 2009 suspension of Fiji marked the first time that a member of the Pacific
Islands Forum had been suspended in the history of the then 38-year-old
organisation.

Following the Fijian general election of 17 September 2014, the Forum lifted
the suspension of Fiji on 22 October 2014.

### Micronesian withdrawal

Following the election of Henry Puna as Secretary-General in February 2021
during a virtual meeting, Palau threatened to leave the Forum, claiming that a
"gentlemen's agreement" to rotate the position between Melanesia, Micronesia,
and Polynesia, had been violated. Puna had won a ballot by one vote (9–8)
against the Marshall Island's Gerald Zackios, who was supported by five
nations from Micronesia. On 4 February, Palau formally terminated its
participation in the forum, citing that the "process regarding the appointment
of the Secretary General has clearly indicated to the Republic of Palau that
unity, regionalism and the Pacific Way no longer guide the Forum", and closed
its embassy in Fiji. On 6 February, the Forum's chair responded to the
allegations, stating that there was a consensus decisions following an agreed
process and that "we have upheld our principles and values as characterised
through the Pacific way". On 8 February the Palau National Congress formally
passed a joint resolution, supporting the decision made by President Surangel
Whipps Jr. to leave the Forum. Whipps has stated Puna has to step down for
Palau to rejoin the Forum.

After Palau's decision to leave the Forum, several other participant countries
have indicated their intention to review their membership. In general, the
countries of Micronesia, with smaller populations and economies, have
complained of being sidelined by larger countries, including Australia, Fiji,
New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea. There had only ever been one Micronesian
Secretary-General of the PIF. The day after Palau's withdrawal, MPs in the
Marshall Islands, who had previously supported Zackios, called for the
government to review its participation in the Forum, but opposed withdrawal.
The Federated States of Micronesia and Nauru have openly questioned whether
they will remain members. Nauru President Lionel Aingimea has signalled his
intention to pull out, stating that "If this is the way Micronesia is treated,
then it is better off withdrawing from the Forum". Four members of the
Micronesian bloc – the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall
Islands, and Nauru – decided to hold a virtual meeting to discuss whether to
exit the Forum. Australia has attempted to convince the four Pacific Island
nations not to pull out. While it has indicated a desire to continue to work
with the Micronesian group if it chose to pull out of the Forum, it emphasised
the need for Pacific unity.

On 9 February 2021, the remaining Micronesian states – the Federated States of
Micronesia, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, and Nauru – decided to leave the
Forum. Micronesian leaders released a statement to "collectively express their
great disappointment with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General
appointment process", with each state jointly agreeing to formally initiate
the process of withdrawal from the Forum. Their departure reduces the Forum to
12 members, all of them in the South Pacific. It may take up to a year for the
countries to formally leave the regional body. Australian Foreign Minister
Marise Payne has stated that "we will continue to work very closely with the
members of the Pacific Forum".

In February 2022, it was announced that the five Micronesian countries would
pause the process of their departure. The President of the Federated States of
Micronesia, David Panuelo, said that he had been told that Henry Puna would
step down as Secretary-General, and that other reforms would occur. The
Pacific Islands Forum secretariat did not officially confirm Puna's departure,
saying only that talks were ongoing. President Whipps of Palau said that the
pause gave the Forum one last chance to do the right thing. In April, it was
reported that the President of the Marshall Islands, David Kabua, was urging
other Micronesian leaders to agree to several proposed reforms but to withdraw
their demand for Puna to step down. In June 2022, Forum leaders reached an
agreement which would see Puna remain in office, and be replaced by a
Micronesian candidate when his term ended. The rotation of the Secretary-
General between Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia would be made a permanent
feature of the Forum, and two deputy secretary-general positions would be
created for the other sub-regions. Kiribati did not agree to the arrangement,
and on 9 July 2022 withdrew from the Forum with immediate effect. Kiribati
rejoined the Forum on 24 February 2023 following an official apology by Forum
chair Sitiveni Rabuka.

## Membership

In September 2011, the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the
Northern Mariana Islands were granted observer status in the Pacific Islands
Forum, while in September 2016 the French territories of French Polynesia and
New Caledonia were granted full membership. Easter Island (administered by
Chile) and Hawaii (an oceanic state of the U.S.) have both considered gaining
representation. Kiribati withdrew from the Forum in 2022. The government of
Kiribati changed its mind the next year in 2023 and decided to rejoin the
forum, making its plans clear by a meeting of President of Kiribati Taneti
Mamau with Prime Minister of Fiji Sitiveni Rabuka where Mamau told Rabuka
about Kiribati's plan. Rabuka confirmed to the media that such a meeting did
take place and stated that Kiribati had reconciled with the Pacific Islands
Forum and would rejoin the Forum soon. In August 2024, American Samoa and Guam
were elevated to associate members.

In late August 2024, the Solomon Islands tabled a motion challenging Taiwan's
participation in the Forum as a partner country. According to _The Australian_
newspaper, China had issued a directive to prevent Taiwan from participating
in the 2025 Forum meeting, scheduled to be held in Solomon Islands. In early
September 2024, China's Ambassador to the Pacific Qian Bo successfully lobbied
for the Forum to remove references to Taiwan in the final communique of the
2024 leaders' summit in Tonga that week.

## Institutions and legal framework

Library and archives building at the Secretariat complex in Suva, Fiji.

The Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat was established initially as a trade
bureau in 1972 and later became the _South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-
operation_ (SPEC). The name _South Pacific Forum Secretariat_ was approved by
member governments in 1988 and changed to _Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat_
in 2000.

There are four divisions in the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, and each of
these divisions has direct responsibility for a range of programs designed to
improve the capacity of the Forum member countries and to co-ordinate action
on matters of common interest:

  1. Development and Economic Policy
  2. Trade and Investment
  3. Political, International and Legal Affairs
  4. Corporate Services

The Forum Economic Ministers Meeting (FEMM) established in 1995, plays a key
role in assessing regional economic developments.

## Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement

The Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement (PICTA) aims to establish a free-
trade area between 14 of the Pacific Islands Forum countries. As of 2013, it
had been signed by 12 states:

  * Cook Islands
  * Fiji
  * Kiribati
  * Micronesia
  * Nauru
  * Niue
  * Papua New Guinea
  * Samoa
  * Solomon Islands
  * Tonga
  * Tuvalu
  * Vanuatu

It has not been signed by either Palau or the Marshall Islands. All of the
signing states have ratified the treaty, with the exception of Micronesia. As
of March 2008, six countries had announced that domestic arrangements had been
made enabling them to trade under the agreement: Cook Islands, Fiji, Niue,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu.

After the trade agreement goes into force, countries commit to removing
tariffs on most goods by 2021. As of April 2008, The Forum Island Countries
are also negotiating an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European
Union. It is important to note that the PICTA discussed here covers only the
trade of goods. At the Forum Island Leaders Meeting held in Rarotonga, Cook
Islands on 28 August 2012, nine members signed the Pacific Island Countries
Trade Agreement Trade in Services (PICTA TIS). As of April 2008, there is an
ongoing negotiation to design and agree on a protocol to include trade in
services and the temporary movement of natural persons (a broader concept than
the GATS's Mode 4).

The Office of the Chief Trade Adviser was established on 29 March 2010 to
provide independent advice and support to the Pacific Forum Island Countries
(FICs) in the PACER Plus trade negotiations with Australia and New Zealand.

## Blue Pacific – collective security interests of member states

The Biketawa Declaration (2000) on collective security committed Pacific
Islands Forum members to eight values, including good governance, liberty of
the individual, democratic processes, indigenous rights and cultural values,
traditions and customs, and recognising the importance and urgency of
equitable economic, social and cultural development to satisfy the basic needs
and aspirations of the peoples of the Forum.

The Boe Declaration (2018) of Regional Security is a declaration agreed to by
all the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum on 5 September 2018, which
declaration is a framework for coordinating response to regional crises, and
sets out an expanded concept of security. The Boe Declaration extended the
Biketawa Declaration (2000) to include issues of human security, environmental
security, transnational crime, and cybersecurity.

The expanded concept of security set out in the Boe Declaration has been
applied in the Falepili Union between Tuvalu and Australia (2023).

## Recent works

An "open skies" policy has been under work by a number of nations. The Pacific
Islands Air Services Agreement or PIASA would allow member nations to have
more access for their airlines to other member countries. To date there have
been ten signatories, Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea,
Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Six countries have
ratified the agreement: Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu.

At the 19–20 August 2008 Pacific Islands Forum meeting in Niue, the leaders
discussed Pacific Plan priorities including, "fisheries, energy, trade and
economic integration, climate change and transport, in addition to information
and communication technology, health, education, and good governance." Leaders
also discussed the impacts of climate change and adopted the _Niue Declaration
on Climate Change_. Restoration of democratic governance in Fiji was discussed
as were consequences should the interim government fail to meet established
deadlines. Regional assistance to the Solomon Islands and Nauru was discussed,
followed by discussion of radioactive contamination in the Marshall Islands
from US government tests. Regional institutional framework issues and WTO Doha
round developments were discussed, followed by discussion of country-
initiatives and the Pacific Region Infrastructure Facility launched 19 August
2008 to provide up to A$200 million over four years to help improve
infrastructure in Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.
The United Nations announced that it would partner with Samoa to develop an
Inter-Agency Climate Change Centre to help Pacific island nations combat the
impacts of climate change in the region. In the 2013 forum, the Marshall
Islands, supported by all other Pacific nations, claimed compensation from the
United States for the nuclear tests conducted on the islands during the 1940s
and 1950s.

In the Nadi Bay declaration of 30 July 2019, the Pacific Islands Forum warned
that coral atoll nations could be uninhabitable as early as 2030, expressed
their deeply concern about a lack of "comprehension, ambition or commitment"
from developed nations and called for an immediate reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions.

On 27 January 2021, the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum
Secretariat agreed a project worth EUR 5.75 million to enhance the trade
capacity of Pacific Island countries. The project titled "Strengthening
Pacific Intra-Regional and International Trade (SPIRIT)" is designed to boost
and increase intra-regional and international trade by strengthening
institutional and technical capacity in the Pacific Island region. It will
also facilitate the implementation of other trade agreements, in particular
the Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and of the Pacific's Aid-for-Trade
Strategy 2020–2025.
