                "The exchange rate remained relatively stable, indicating effective monetary policy by Papua New Guinea.",
                "The kina's depreciation was primarily due to a global strengthening of the US dollar unrelated to Papua New Guinea's economy.",

                "0": "Incorrect. The exchange rate changed significantly over the period, indicating instability rather than stability.",
                "1": "Incorrect. While global US dollar strength may have played a role, the consistent depreciation over two decades suggests domestic factors also contributed.",
                "2": "Incorrect. The data shows depreciation of the kina (from 1.276 K per US$1 in 1995 to 3.14 K in 2016), which contradicts appreciation due to export growth.",
                "3": "Correct. The steady increase in the number of kina per US dollar indicates depreciation, which can be linked to inflation and external economic pressures affecting Papua New Guinea over the period."

Depreciation could increase the cost of imported goods, leading to inflation.\n2. A weaker kina might boost export competitiveness by making exports cheaper in foreign currency terms.\n3. Persistent depreciation may deter foreign investment due to currency risk.\n\nWhich of the statements is/are correct?",

              "options": [
                "The depreciation had no significant effect on the domestic economy due to Papua New Guinea's self-sufficiency.",

                "0": "Incorrect. Papua New Guinea relies on imports for many goods; thus, depreciation affects the economy significantly.",
