                "It allows the central bank to freely devalue the currency to maximize the local value of foreign aid.",

                "0": "Incorrect. Under a fixed exchange rate, devaluation is not freely possible; it requires official policy decisions.",

                "2": "Correct. A fixed exchange rate regime (Bullet Point 3) constrains monetary policy autonomy, meaning the central bank cannot easily adjust interest rates without risking the peg. Therefore, managing foreign aid inflows (Bullet Point 1) requires caution to prevent inflationary pressures.",
                "3": "Incorrect. Fixed exchange rates do not automatically adjust currency value; they require active policy to maintain the peg."

                "The subdivision into cents is primarily symbolic and does not affect economic activities related to exchange rate stability.",

                "The decimal subdivision facilitates precise currency conversion and pricing, complementing the stable exchange rate to enhance trade and aid transactions.",
