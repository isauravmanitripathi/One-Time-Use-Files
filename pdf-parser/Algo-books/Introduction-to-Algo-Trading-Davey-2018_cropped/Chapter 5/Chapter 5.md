# CHAPTER 5 – THE DISADVANTAGES AND MISCONCEPTIONS OF ALGO TRADING

After reading the previous chapter, the world of algo trading might seem to be a nirvana, compared to your current method of trading. Unfortunately, it is anything but. Algo trading, like any type of trading, is extremely tough and full of pitfalls. It is important that you realize some of the major disadvantages before you embark on your algorithmic trading career. These disadvantages might just change your mind about wanting to algo trade.

### Disadvantage #1 – Emotions Are Still A Part Of Trading

I still vividly remember my first "algo" trade, the same one I talk about in the introduction. No one called it algorithmic trading back then, but that is what it was. I had rules, I followed the rules, and I should have been emotionless, like a robot.

Instead, I was scared to death!

I called the broker every 15 minutes and asked "can I get the last price for June Live Hogs?" Then I'd calculate my open position profit or loss based on the latest number. For the next 15 minutes, I'd either be euphoric because I was making money, or depressed because I was losing money. The broker started getting annoyed with my constant calls. There was no online way to check prices then, if you recall those olden days. If there would have been online quotes, I'm sure I would have refreshed that quote page every minute.

So why was I scared to death, acting like a crazy person? After all, so many people say that when you trade with rules, it takes the emotion out of trading. I should have been a calm, cool, collected robot.

Except I wasn't – I was a bundle of stomach wrenching nerves!

The truth is that ANY time you are trading with money, emotions enter into the equation. The rapid gain or loss of capital is what brings on the emotion, not the style of trading. Algo trading, discretionary trading, random guessing trading – it does not matter which approach you take- is emotional once money is involved.

So, how come so many "gurus" out there recommend algo trading because it is supposedly emotionless? I believe it is all a sales ploy by these crooks. The charlatans know that emotions ruin a lot of traders, and that traders are looking to avoid emotion, so they claim that algo trading solves the emotion problem.

Except it doesn't. As I said, emotions are because of the money involved, not the type of trading. My personal guess is that people who say algo trading is emotionless either 1) trade only on a simulator, or 2) do not

trade at all, in any fashion. They clearly do not trade with real money.

That being said, the emotions experienced by algo trading are a bit different than the emotions of discretionary trading. Gone is the panic feeling of wondering if you should enter or exit a trade. But, that is replaced with the panic feeling of wondering if you should turn an algo on or off. Basically, for every event in discretionary trading that causes emotion, there is likely a similar, but different, parallel emotion in algo trading.

So the first misconception in algo trading – that there is no emotion - is also the first disadvantage. Trading with real money involves emotion. You must learn to accept that.

### Disadvantage #2 – Computer Programming

If the thought of having to program a computer scares you, then maybe algo trading is not for you. Although there are visual programming tools out there to assist, to really be a good algo trader, you need to be able to program your trading rules. True, you could just hire someone to do that for you, but since most algos fail testing, paying someone to program will get expensive very quickly. Programming thousands of algos is a big task.

So, if you decide to algo, just convince yourself right now that you will learn to program. Once you start doing it, knowing how to program will move this from a disadvantage to an advantage.

### Disadvantage #3 – The Past Is Not The Future

If you have seen ads for trading education, trading systems, brokers, etc. you have undoubtedly seen the U.S. government required disclaimer "past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results."

This is a great warning for all traders. It simply means that no matter what historical testing shows, it does not mean the performance will continue in the future. In fact, many times the opposite happens, sort of a reversion to the mean situation.

This presents a conundrum for algo traders, who almost always historically backtest their approaches before commencing with live trading. Why even backtest if the past performance doesn't correlate with future performance?

Obviously, backtesting an algo presents a sticky situation. A trader wants the reassurance that an algo did work historically, and yet at the same time must realize that everything could fall apart from day one of live trading.

The trick, it turns out, is to have a development method that has been proven to work in historical testing and real time testing. It is not as simple as just optimizing parameters, as most trading platforms would make you believe. This will be discussed in more detail later.

Historical testing, then, is like walking a tightrope over a pit of molten lava. Once false move, and death awaits. But when done correctly, the crowd cheers in awe. Our goal will obviously be the latter result!

### Disadvantage #4 – Tweaking Is Fun

When I first drafted the book, one female proof reader asked me "why is twerking a disadvantage? Twerking is fun, and I love to do it, but I don't get what it has to do with trading."

Well, that might be true, although I am a little too old to be twerking (trust me!). And besides, the word is TWEAKING. Changing one letter makes a big difference!

Tweaking is the natural tendency to want to change and improve things. As I showed earlier, making improvements is an important part of trading. But, it is not a desired part of algo development. Tweaking can really cause problems.

Here is an example: I have a trader friend who has been developing and tweaking his strategy for over 5 years. Every time he has a losing trade, he examines it closely, and finds a reason why that trade was invalid. He then creates a rule – a tweak – to eliminate that trade. His backtest looks better, since that pesky trade will never occur again, and he is happy.

Happy, of course, until the next tweak is needed.

So, for over five years, his strategy has been tweaked to death. In fact, I'd wager that his algo has much more tweaking code than original strategy code. And, unfortunately, his real time results never get better. There is always one more tweak to be done.

Tweaking your code is easy. But it is wrong to do, and that makes it a big disadvantage for algo trading.

### Disadvantage #5 – I'm The Boss Here!

Earlier, I wrote about having a business with employees. With trading, the only employee is typically yourself. This can be a major advantage – no employees to coddle or stress over – but it can also be a major disadvantage.

If your algo strategies fail to perform – it is usually your fault.

If you fail to develop new strategies – only you are to blame.

If you make mistakes in automating your algos, perform futures contract rollovers incorrectly, miss deadlines – it falls on you.

No matter what the decision, or what the action, for better or worse, you are the Big Cheese, the Head Honcho, the Top Dog ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yC4gm\\_vN3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yC4gm_vN3s)).

While this might seem to be the ultimate freedom for people stuck in jobs they do not like, working for bosses they hate, the truth is that it can be a major disadvantage, too.

In algo trading, when things falls apart – and they will, at least temporarily, to some extent and to some degree – there is no one to blame but yourself. Many traders cannot handle that kind of pressure and accountability.

Being the boss can be great, especially with algo trading. But, just remember that it can also be a big disadvantage.

### Disadvantage #6 – Doing Things The Wrong Way

Algo trading, when done the right way, can work out very well. The problem is that it is exceedingly easy to algo trade incorrectly. And guess what, the wrong way usually leads to losses.

This is a major disadvantage for algo trading because there are many, many ways to develop a trading strategy incorrectly. The list is so long, in fact, that I could probably write a whole book on how NOT to develop trading algo – and maybe one day I will! Many biases, shown below, can really mess up your algo trading.

### 20 COGNITIVE BIASES THAT SCREW UP YOUR DECISIONS

#### 1. Anchoring bias.

People are over-reliant on the first piece of information they<br>hear. In a salary negotiation, er makes the first offer establishes a range of reasonable possibilities in each person's mind.

#### 2. Availability heuristic.

People overestimate the importance of information that is available to them. A person. might argue that smoking is not unhealthy because they know someone who lived to 100 and smoked three packs a day.

6. Clustering illusion.

This is the tendency to see

patterns in random events.

of reds.

It is key to various gambling

fallacies, like the idea that red

is more or less likely to turn up

on a roulette table after a string

#### 3. Bandwagon effect.

The probability of one person adopting a belief increases based on the number of people who hold that belief. This is a powerful form of groupthink and is reason why meetings are often unproductive.

7. Confirmation bias.

information that confirms our

preconceptions - one of the <br>many reasons it's so hard to

have an intelligent conversation

We tend to listen only to

about climate change.

#### 4. Blind-spot bias.

Falling to recognize your own cognitive biases is a bias in itself. People notice cognitive and motivational biases much more in others than in themselves

#### Conservatism bias.

Where people favor prior evidence over new evidence or information that has emerged. People were slow to accept that the Earth was round because they maintained their earlier understanding that the planet was flat.

#### 12. Overconfidence.

Some of us are too confident about our abilities, and this causes us to take greater risks in our daily lives. Experts are more prone to this bias than laypeople, since they are more convinced that they are right.

#### 16. Salience.

Our tendency to focus on the most easily recognizable features of a person or concept. When you think about dying, you might worry about being mauled by a lion, as opposed to what is statistically more likely, like dying in a car accident.

#### 5. Choice-supportive bias.

When you choose something. you tend to feel positive about it, even if that choice has flaws Like how you think your dog is ome - even if it bites people every once in a while

#### 9. Information bias.

The tendency to seek information when it does not affect action. More information is not always botter. With loss information, people can often make more accurate predictions.

#### 13. Placebo effect.

When simply believing that something will have a certain effect on you causes it to have that effect. In medicine, people given fake pills often experience the same physiological effects as people given the real thing.

#### 10. Ostrich effect. The decision to Ignore

dangerous or negative Information by "burying" one's head in the sand, like an ostrich. Research suggests that investors check the value of their holdings significantly less often during bad markets.

#### 14. Pro-innovation bias.

When a proponent of an innovation tends to overvalue its usefulness and undervalue its limitations. Sound familiar, Silicon Valley?

11. Outcome bias. Judging a decision based on the outcome - rather than how exactly the decision was made in the moment. Just because you won a lot in Vegas doesn't mean gambling your money was a smart decision.

So, with all these algo development pitfalls, how can a trader turn this from a disadvantage to an advantage? Surely, if most traders make mistakes during algo creation, then the benefit of correct development becomes even more apparent.

Here are a couple of tips to negate this disadvantage. First, only use trusted sources for your trading advice. The internet is chock full of advice givers, but many of these people do not even trade! Take your advice from someone you know trades.

Second, be willing to take information from many different traders and combine it into something that feels right to you.

Third, prove it via real money trading. Theory is nice, ideas are nicer, but the only thing that matters in the end is the bottom line result. Does your method of algo development produce profits? If it does, congratulations! If it doesn't, you might consider a deep review of your process, and incorporating new concepts or improvements.

Building and trading algos is tough, and there is no one "correct" way to do it. Plus, there are a ton of incorrect ways to do it. That makes this a disadvantage to algo trading.

## Disadvantage #7 – Algo Trading Is Not "Set And Forget"

You might recall a number of years ago a portable cooker that was sold on late night television infomercials. Its slogan was "set it and forget it." It was so easy to use, you could just throw food in it, hit a few buttons, and come back a few hours later to a delicious home cooked meal.

*Figure 18- Definitely Not The Way To Algo Trade!*

Many traders think the same slogan applies to algo trading, especially when automating systems. They are wrong!

Technical support people at Tradestation, a leading trading software platform (and my primary software for trading) have a different slogan: "automated trading does not mean unattended trading."

Whenever you have an automated algo, a million things could go wrong. Internet connections go out, disconnections to trading servers occur, exchanges experience intermittent hiccups, price data corrections come out (but not before the bad data hits your algo) – the list of potential issues is practically infinite.

Multiply all those issues by the dozens of algorithms you might be

trading, and the potential for problems becomes very apparent.

You can't turn on an algo, walk away, and come back a week later to count your profits. It just does not work that way. You don't have to be staring at a screen all day and night, making sure your algos are running correctly, but you do have to monitor your algos, at a minimum of a few times per day. You have to be ready to take action when something goes awry. I guarantee you that some intervention will be required more often than you think.

That is the final misconception and disadvantage of algo trading – you have to stay on top of your algos, and keep a watchful eye over them. Definitely do not "set it and forget it!"
