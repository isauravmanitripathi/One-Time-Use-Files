In 2017-8, I asked readers of my blog to tell me which trading platform was their favorite. Here are the latest results:

*Figure 21- Worldwide Survey, Trading Platforms*

While the results of this survey are enlightening, I should point out that it is not a rigorous scientific survey. The results are probably a bit biased

towards the top four – Tradestation, Ninja Trader, MultiCharts, and MetaTrader, since those are the primary platforms I use or have used. Many survey respondents are familiar with my work, so it follows that they might use the same software I do.

In any event, here is some more information on the top 7 choices selected by survey respondents:

#### Tradestation – [www.tradestation.com](http://www.tradestation.com)

Overview, from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TradeStation>

*"TradeStation Group, Inc. is the parent company of online securities & futures brokerage firms and trading technology companies. It is headquartered in Plantation, Florida, and has offices in New York, Chicago, Richardson, TX, London, Sydney and Costa Rica.

**Full disclosure:** I use Tradestation as my primary algo development and automated trading tool. It is not perfect, I sometimes have issues with it, but in the end, I am VERY satisfied with what it does and what it can deliver.

## MultiCharts – [www.multicharts.com](http://www.multicharts.com)

#### **Overview, from [www.multicharts.com](http://www.multicharts.com)**

*"MultiCharts is an award-winning trading platform. Whether you need day trading software or you invest for longer periods, MultiCharts has features that may help achieve your trading goals. High-definition charting, built-in indicators and strategies, one-click trading from chart and DOM, high-precision backtesting, brute-force and genetic optimization, automated execution and support for EasyLanguage scripts are all key tools at your disposal."*

**Full disclosure:** I do not own MultiCharts, but I have used it and have tested it. It is similar to Tradestation, and most Tradestation Easy Language code easily converts to MultiCharts Power Language. If something bad ever happened to Tradestation, my backup plan would be to port all my algo strategies to MultiCharts.

## MetaTrader4/5 – [www.metatrader4.com](http://www.metatrader4.com)

#### **Overview, from [www.metatrader4.com](http://www.metatrader4.com)**

**Full disclosure:** I have MetaTrader 4, and use it to auto trade some forex instruments. I have only done a little programming with it, though.

### Think Or Swim – [www.thinkorswim.com](http://www.thinkorswim.com)

**Full Disclosure:** In house platform for the TD Ameritrade brokerage. I have never used it.

## Amibroker – [www.amibroker.com](http://www.amibroker.com)

**Full Disclosure:** I have never used this platform, but I have seen code from it, and it seems pretty straightforward. It also has some neat features many other platforms do not have. The prominent trading book author Howard Bandy uses Amibroker, along with Python (below).

## Python, R and Matlab – [www.python.org](http://www.python.org) www.r-project.org www.mathworks.com

**Full Disclosure:** I have used these programming packages a bit in nontrading activities. All are very flexible, and more and more traders/programmers are beginning to use them. I would consider them more programming platforms that can do trading, as opposed to pure trading platforms. If you want a bespoke, customized trading solution, one of these languages may be the best option.
