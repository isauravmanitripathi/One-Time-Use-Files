# CHAPTER 3 - IS ALGO TRADING FOR YOU?

*"You don't have enough experience." "You are just not the right person for the job." "You would not be a good fit for this position / for our organization."*

If you have ever looked for a job, chances are you heard one or more of these excuses from a potential employer. The problem is how do you know that what they are saying is true, without even giving you a chance to prove yourself?

Algo trading is the same way, except that eventually you will find out if algo trading is right for you. Unfortunately, though, the way traders find out is by the market extracting money from your account!

I am going to shortcut that painful process for you.

In later chapters, I'll help with the first rejection – experience. This book will help you get the experience you need to start to algo trade. You'll be on the right path, although there will be a lot more to do.

For the other two rejections – knowing if you are the right person for algo trading, and if this type of trading "fits" your personality – in this chapter I'll discuss some of the important personality characteristics and traits I think are important (or not important) to be a successful algo trader.

Remember, you are a small retail trader, and the trading world is full of professional "sharks." If you want to compete, you first have to know if algo trading fits you. This chapter is a great way to find out.

My advice is to get a piece of paper, write down each of the traits I list, and then after I explain it, grade yourself on each one. You'll soon see if

algorithmic trading fits you!

## Analytical Thinking

Scientists say there are two types of people in the world, left brain thinkers and right brain thinkers. Left brain people tend to be more analytical, numbers oriented. Typically, these people are found in positions like doctors, lawyers, accountants, scientists, engineers, computer programmers, etc. Rules appeal to these sorts of people.

Right brain people, on the other hand, tend to be more free thinkers. Artists, musicians, sales people, marketing folk and other "soft skill" careers tend to be their domain.

Both types of people are important to the world. Think of life without artists like Monet, composers like Beethoven, brilliant logical thinkers like Einstein. The world would be a sad place without a mix.

In trading, certain areas seem to work better for lefties and righties. Right brain traders may be more in tune with visual chart trading, and discretionary trading. Most traders I have worked with for algo trading tend to be more left brain thinkers. Over the years, I have done algo work with many doctors and scientists, but not so many artists.

Now I realize I have really oversimplified things here. But in general, the analytical type left brain thinkers are more likely to find algo trading appealing, and are more likely to succeed at it.

Give yourself one point if you are primarily a left brain, analytical thinker.

## Control Freak?

A while back, I met a trader for coffee. He was going to go live with his forex system the next week. He had years of favorable backtests, solid and 100% defined rules, and he had automation all set up.

So, a week later, I asked him how things went. He told me he made \$500 that first week, on a \$5,000 account. Nice, I told him. But he shook his head and sheepishly replied "Not really. I turned the system on and off a few times during the week. Had I just let it run, I would have made \$2,500!"

He was a classic control freak. But he is not that unusual.

Many traders like to have "their finger on the button" – to always be ready to enter or exit a trade at a moment's notice when something does not feel right. The idea of letting a computer alone control entries and exits is anathema to what these people are all about. These traders want, and actually crave, the ultimate control over trades.

A good non-trading example of this is with "helicopter" parents. These are parents who hover over their children, ready to swoop in at a moment's notice to "save" their progeny, no matter their age. I have even heard of these helicopter control freaks e-mailing college professors and employers on behalf of their children! Control freaks, to the max.

Algo trading, on the other hand, is all about letting go. It is about preparing, testing, and setting up the trading strategy, but when the time comes, letting go and letting the backtest proven algorithm do its job. It is not easy to do, especially at first. But it is essential to proper algorithmic trading.

If you are NOT a control freak, give yourself one point.

#### Tinkerers/Perfectionists

Do you have the need to be right, to be perfect? That is a great attribute to have in school, and also in many "analytical" type careers. But it is awful to have in trading!

*Figure 7- Should This Be Your Goal When Backtesting? (Answer: "No!")*

Why? Why shouldn't we, as traders, aim for terrific looking historical backtests, for trading perfection?

The answer might come as a shock – NOOOOO!

Looking for perfection, tinkering with a trading algorithm until it produces a great backtest, is actually about the worst thing you can do. You actually trick yourself, thinking that by continually testing, you make things better (notice a bit of control freakiness in that?).

But the best traders only test as much as they absolutely need to. They

realize perfection is impossible, so they do not try to achieve it.

Think of things you do outside trading – if you always strive to be perfect, or always try to improve things, that is an algo trading warning sign. Give yourself 1 point if you are NOT a perfectionist or tinkerer.

### Emotionally Charged People

*Figure 8- Does This Keg Of Dynamite Describe Your Typical Emotional State? Not Good For A Trader!*

Some folks, by nature, are very excitable. They cheer the loudest, they boo the loudest, they wear their hearts on their sleeve. You almost always know where they stand on an issue.

On the other hand, some folks are calm under pressure, never get rattled, never get too high, or too low – regardless of what happens.

Which are you? Give yourself two points if you consider yourself calm, cool and collected most of the time. It is a great way to be when you are algo trading.

#### Patient People

Take a minute and google the phrase "trading system quick wealth." You'll find over 2,000,000 matches.

Then google "trading system slow wealth" – you will only see about 300,000 matches.

Clearly, most people want wealth quickly – I mean, who really wants to wait? Yet waiting and patience is a big key to success. You are not going to create a dozen algorithms the first week after you start algo trading. And your algos likely will not make you rich overnight.

Good trading is about being patient, letting trades play out, letting strategies play out. Have you ever tried a new strategy, then abandoned it after a week of losing money? Maybe your strategy was indeed a loser, but maybe it just had an unlucky week.

Think of trading like running a long foot race. Many runners start sprinting from the start. Some pull a hamstring because they weren't properly warmed up. Others get off to a big lead, but then they realize – they are in a marathon race of 26.2 miles, not a 100 yard dash!

Treat trading as a marathon. Take your time, be patient. As they say "Rome was not built in one day." Give yourself 1 point if you are able to take things slowly.

## Rule Followers

Have you ever seen little kids color in a coloring book? Some will neatly stay within the lines. Others will treat the lines as a guideline only, and draw whatever the heck they want. Both can create beautiful final masterpieces though!

that rule followers tend to be more left brain oriented, but not always.

Good algo traders tend to be rule followers. Give yourself one point if you consider yourself a rule follower.

### Frequently Frustrated Folk

I have three kids, all pretty much equally talented. But when it comes to sports, many times my youngest comes up short. The problem? He gets easily frustrated. As soon as a roadblock appears in his way, he gives up, or pouts, gets mad and then gives up.

He'd be a terrible algo trader, at least right now.

How "frustration free" are you? Developing algo strategies is chock full of frustration. If you cannot handle setbacks, roadblocks and near constant frustration, you will be in trouble. Algo trading system development is not easy – if it was everyone would do it!

Give yourself two points if you can handle and overcome frustration easily.

#### Process Oriented Practitioners

How do you currently evaluate potential strategies? Do you evaluate each one the same, running through the same steps? If so, give yourself one point – following a defined process is good for algo traders.

If you don't have a process, whether that be for finding and testing trading strategies, actual trading or analysis of your trading results after the fact, give yourself zero points.

The best algo traders tend to be the most process oriented. They consistently adhere to their approach to the markets, and in how they go about trading.

Why is this important? Simply put, there is no right way to trade, but there are a million wrong ways. By being a consistent, process oriented trader, one can more easily make in-course adjustments.

In the field of Quality Assurance, it is known as the Plan Do Check Act cycle. In the Act phase, a trader will figure out ways to improve upon what he or she is doing. Imagine how hard it is to make changes when there is no set process! (Hint: it is really impossible. Having a process lends itself to making improvements).

Add one point to your total if you are process oriented.

## Grand Total

How did you do? There were 10 possible points with this exercise.

- If you hit 9 or 10 points, congrats! You have most of the skills and traits necessary to conquer algo trading.
- If you hit 6-8 points, you are close to being algo ready, but you are not quite there yet. Take some time, and work on the areas where you fall short.
- If you scored 5 or fewer points, take a step back and re-evaluate your situation. Is algo trading really what you want to do? It is not for everyone, and certainly, it is better to find out now that your personality does not mesh with algo trading, rather than down the road, after a lot of likely wasted time and wasted money. Algo trading is not for everyone, so if your personality does not support it, I recommend you look at a different type of trading.

#### The Good News

The good news is if you are really excited about the possibilities of algo trading, with a little effort you can turn each of your liabilities into an asset. For example, if you do not have a set process for trading, go create one, and most importantly, follow it. If you get easily frustrated, or you are an emotional powder keg, realizing that is the first step to changing it. It will take some time, but before you even think about algo trading, spend some time working on yourself. Once you can score 9 or 10 on the exercise, then you'll be in good shape to start taking part in the many advantages of algorithmic trading.
