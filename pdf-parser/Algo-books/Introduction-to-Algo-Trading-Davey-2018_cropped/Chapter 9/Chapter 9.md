# CHAPTER 9 - TRADING PLATFORM – NEXT STEPS

Once you have a trading platform selected, it is time to get to work! Before you can start creating and trading your algos, there are some specific platform tasks you need to master. Here is how I would do it, in the order I would recommend for you.

## Learn The "Help" Sources Of Your Platform

Starting out with a new trading platform, whichever one it is, will certainly be a daunting task. You will need help. Luckily, if you choose one of the top platforms detailed in the previous chapter, you will find help in all sorts of places.

The first source of help should be the software vendor itself. They have trained people to answer most questions, especially for beginners. As you progress in your knowledge, though, you'll realize that other users are sometimes a better source of information. In the beginning, though, the vendor or their online help files and videos should be a first resort.

Once important thing to remember with vendor help – if it is a trade specific issue (missed order, bad fill, etc) you should always call the Trade Desk at your broker first. They are always the best source of information for specific trade details of your account. They might refer you to technical support, but when I have an issue and am unsure of my current position, I first call the Trade Desk.

Sometimes the vendor can't answer your question, or can't spend the time with you that you need. Luckily, there are 3 rd party sources of technical assistance. For example, YouTube has a ton of useful videos for Tradestation. Many of these outside sources provide free information, along with paid services.

I think the true experts are the software users who are also traders. Make sure you know how to contact these people. Usually they can be found on trading forums like futures.io or elitetrader.com. Also, every software vendor has a user forum, where the best answers might come from experienced users and traders. I use Tradestation's user forum quite a bit, and I still ask questions to this day, some 14 years after I started using the software. The learning never ends!

### Learn The Basics Of Your Platform

Don't make the mistake of trying to create an algo trading strategy the first day you start up your new trading software. Take some time, learn the basics, get a feel for how things are set up and how they work.

Be a child with the software. Have you ever watched a child interact with new software? I have with my three kids, and I can say, they are absolutely fearless. They will click on anything and everything, knowing they can usually shut the software down and start it up again fresh.

Be a kid – play with your new toy! Pull up a chart, throw some indicators on it, apply some canned strategies to the chart, and take a look at the resulting performance report. Explore and play – you will learn more quickly that way.

### Learn The Basics Of Programming

Since most of your algo development will eventually consist of building strategies, learn how to do it! Start by learning the basic structure of the programming language – if…then statements, buy and sell order syntax, etc.

Each platform vendor likely has free manuals, reference guides, videos, etc. Most also have paid services, like introductory programming "boot camps." There are also plenty of third party companies with both free and paid programming tips.

But even with a comprehensive programming manual at your side, nothing can take the place of actually programming and practicing on your own.

Take a look at any strategies supplied with the software. Figure out what each line does, and how it is written. Make a copy of the strategy, and then modify the copy. Make small changes at first, and then progressively attempt more complicated changes.

Eventually, you will feel confident enough to build your own strategy from scratch. That might take a few days, weeks or even months, but that is where you eventually want to be – where you can easily modify existing strategies, and create your own new strategies.

## Learn The Basics of Strategy Development and Evaluation

One major topic your software will not help you with is developing strategies in a proper manner. It is not as simple as applying a strategy to a chart, running a lot of optimization and then live trading the best overall optimized result. In fact, that is the exact WRONG thing to do, even though the software makes it so easy.

Correct strategy development and evaluation is a big topic, and there are very good books out there on proper strategy development. Books by Pardo, Tomasini and Davey are among the best for learning proper strategy development processes, in my opinion. I recommend you get a couple or all of these books, and incorporate their lessons into how you develop strategies.

## Put it all together – Start with a chart, End with a strategy

Follow the steps in the next chapter, where I create a simple strategy. Although I use Tradestation for my example, you should be able to replicate each of the steps in your platform. Once you can easily do all these steps, you are in good position to begin creating your own trading algos.

#### Learn How To "Trick" Your Platform

The last task in learning your software is learning how to fool it. Almost every trading platform can be "gamed." That is, there are coding tricks and software settings that produce phenomenal equity curves. An example is below. I created this strategy in 1 minute. Looks perfect to trade, doesn't it? One slight problem, though – it is fake, and the results are based on exploiting the trading software backtest engine.

Once you know a few ways to create fake, but perfect, looking equity curves, I'd say you know your software well enough. At that point, you know you are on your way to being an expert!
