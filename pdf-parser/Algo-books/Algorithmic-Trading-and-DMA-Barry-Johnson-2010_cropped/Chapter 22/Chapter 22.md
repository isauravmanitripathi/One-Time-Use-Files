# Appendix $F$ **Other markets**

A few types of financial asset do not quite fit in the main categories. Most notably, depositary receipts and exchange traded funds. Both asset classes have seen considerable growth over the last few years.

Depositary receipts (DRs) are securities that represent the shares of a foreign company. They provide an important means of accessing the major financial markets for foreign companies, as well as offering a cheaper alternative to cross-border trading. In a sense, DRs may be viewed as derivatives, since they have an underlying asset. However, there is no contract based on some future value of the underlier, as in futures and options. So really, they are more a proxy than a derivative.

Exchange traded funds (ETF), as their name suggests, represent tradable investment funds. Like depositary receipts, they have helped provide an easier and cheaper means for investors to access assets from other markets. Since they represent baskets of assets, they are an extremely efficient means for investors to gain much broader exposure to sectors or markets, much like futures.

# **Depositary receipts**

Depositary receipts allow trading in shares of foreign companies without having to carry out any cross-border transactions. Note that these are for single companies and bear no relation to the similarly named Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipt (SPDR), which is an exchange-traded fund (ETF).

# Asset specific

Depositary receipts (DRs) essentially act as proxies for foreign shares that may be traded locally either at exchanges, other execution venues or OTC. They are issued by a domestic bank or brokerage against their own inventory of the foreign stock. Note that the ratio of shares does not have to be 1:1, so a single depositary receipt might translate to  $0.5$ ,  $5$ ,  $10$  or even 100 foreign shares, depending on the share price. A sponsored DR means that the depositary bank is also involved with the foreign company, for instance, organising proxy votes for the DR holders. An un-sponsored DR is issued without such involvement, so holders may not receive the same shareholder benefits or voting rights. Any dividends are generally paid in the local currency, and for a fee the depositary bank will convert the receipts back into the underlying stock. So in many respects they behave much like domestic stocks.

DRs are attractive to companies since they allow them to raise capital from abroad, without having to undertake many of the onerous reporting and accounting requirements, which would otherwise be necessary for dual listing.

An American Depositary Receipt (ADR) for a foreign company is priced in dollars and may be traded OTC or on the major U.S. exchanges. The first ADR was in fact issued by JP Morgan in 1927 for the London department store Selfridges & Co. There are several levels of ADR available to issuers. These dictate how and where they may be traded, and are based on how much U.S. reporting the company is prepared to do. The easiest starting point for firms is to issue them as restricted stock, under SEC Rule 144(a), although this restricts trading to only be for large institutional investors (or qualified institutional buyers). Alternatively, Regulation S allows trading, but only for offshore non-U.S. residents. Neither of these options enforces any specific reporting requirements on the company. A Level I ADR has minimal reporting requirements, but still only permits OTC trading of the company's ADRs. Quarterly and annual reporting to the SEC is not mandatory, similarly there is no requirement to follow the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standards. For Level II ADRs, the company must file a GAAP compliant annual report with the SEC. This allows them to be traded on a U.S. exchange, provided they meet the appropriate listing requirements. Finally, a Level III ADR has the highest level of reporting requirements since it means the company is actually issuing new shares in the U.S.

Depositary receipts are also used outside the U.S., European depositary receipts allow trading and settlement on Europe's stock exchanges. Likewise, global depositary receipts (GDRs) are effectively global equivalents of ADRs. They allow trading in more than one country, often this means both Europe and the U.S.

A similar approach is used for the large number of Canadian companies that are crosslisted on U.S. exchanges. These so-called Canadian ordinaries do not require a depositary bank as an intermediary, so there are no restrictions on trading and no conversion fees. Though, as Louis Gagnon and G. Andrew Karolyi (2003) point out, they are not 100% fungible, since those traded on U.S. exchanges must be held in U.S. dollar accounts and their dividends are also made in U.S. dollars.

Global registered shares (GRS), or global ordinaries, adopt a similar approach to Canadian ordinaries. These may be traded internationally, such as on the NYSE, as well as on their domestic exchange. Again, there are no conversion fees, although the process does need to be coordinated between agents. The GRS was first created in 1998 for DaimlerChrysler AG, currently only a handful of companies use this structure.

### Pricing and trading

A depositary receipt is based on an underlying asset, namely a foreign stock. Its value is dependent on the current market price of this underlying asset, rather than some future value. Therefore, the price of a DR should be similar to the price of the foreign stock, adjusted by the current market exchange rates. Note that the conversion ratio is usually chosen by the depositary agent to best reflect the value of the foreign shares. Hence, the price of most ADRs is between \$10 and \$100. So for cheaper stocks each ADR share might equate to hundreds of actual shares in the company.

There are some complications, though: A true price comparison should also factor in the fees associated with converting a DR into the actual stock. The savings in management and settlement costs which the DR offers may also be reflected in the price of the DR. Also there is the transaction cost associated with any FX trades to consider. So differences in the prices of the two assets do not necessarily represent arbitrage opportunities.

When trading DRs, it is vital to remember that they are based on foreign stocks. Consequently, they are much more likely to be impacted by shifts in the exchange rate. Whilst for DRs based on emerging market companies there may also be the risk of inflation to consider. Time-zones can also have a considerable effect since the market for the underlying stock may well be closed whilst its DRs are being traded, or vice versa.

Research into the relationship between prices for ADRs and their underlying stocks confirms that the most information is held by the underlying stock. Though, analysis by Gagnon and Karolyi (2003) also found that cross-listed stocks tend to have higher systematic price co-movements with the U.S. and lower co-movements with local indices than other stocks. We review such relationships in more detail in Chapter 13.

## Global DR markets

Worldwide, there were 2,130 depositary receipts at the end of 2008. An increase of 30% on the year before, based on figures from the annual review by the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) (2008). <sup>16</sup> They encompass companies from 77 countries. The BRIC <sup>17</sup> countries dominate the market in terms of numbers, accounting for a third of the issued depositary receipts. In fact, India has the highest number of depositary receipts for any country (276) followed by Russia (176), whilst Brazil has 128 and China 110. Developed countries also play a major role, for instance, the U.K. has 141 depositary receipts and Australia has 125.

The majority of these are actually GDRs (1,013) followed by U.S. Level I ADRs (716) and U.S. listed Level II and III ADRs (403). The popularity of GDRs is, in part, due to the stricter regulatory requirements in the U.S. Though, a change in rulings by the SEC has simplified the process for un-sponsored DR programs which are to be traded OTC. So the balance may change; indeed, 2008 saw 605 new un-sponsored depositary receipts created.

In terms of investment value, by the end of 2008 over \$1.2 trillion was invested in depositary receipts, a decrease of about 25% since 2007. U.S. listed ADRs accounted for \$773 billion, European listed DRs were only worth \$214 billion, whilst the remaining OTC and other receipts were worth around \$163 billion. In terms of issuance, the largest proportion was for western European companies (\$452 billion), whilst the remainder was split fairly evenly between firms from Emerging Europe and Africa (\$249 billion), Latin America (\$237 billion), and Asia Pacific (\$212 billion).

For 2008, the global value of depositary receipt trading was around \$4.4 trillion, a third higher than the year before. In comparison, 2007's volumes were 72% higher than those of 2006, so the financial crisis slowed the massive growth that the DR markets were seeing. DRs for firms from the BRIC countries accounted for the majority of this trading with around 54% of it. Specifically, Brazil led with \$899 billion worth of trading, from China's \$792 billion and Russia's \$579 billion. Most of the trading is executed at stock exchanges, in fact only 2% was traded OTC. Table F-1 shows a more detailed breakdown of the trading volumes at major venues.

The U.S. is clearly the largest market for DRs. Given that around \$70 trillion traded on the two major U.S. exchanges in 2008, DRs accounted for around 5% of this total. Though, the trading is quite concentrated. In fact, the top five ADRs accounted for 27% of the total U.S. exchange turnover. This was led by China's Baidu Inc. (\$331bn) and Brazil's Petrobras (\$244bn) and Vale (\$204bn). The top ten also included Finland's Nokia, Mexico's America Movil, the UK's BP and Australia's BHP Billiton.

#### **Table F-1 Global traded volumes of Depositary Receipts**

The NYSE is still the world's largest market for DRs, with more than two thirds of the global market share. The BNYM (2008) report points out that 44 DR programs had a trading value greater than \$25 billion in 2007, 40 of these were listed on the NYSE. Trading DRs is supported electronically via NYSE Hybrid, just like any normal stock. Similarly, the NASDAQ supports ADR trading just as if they were stocks. There are no figures for levels of trading on ECNs and ATSs, although venues such as ITG POSIT and Pipeline also allow them to be traded.

The London Stock Exchange's International Order Book (IOB) is still the leading competitor for the U.S exchanges. It handles much of the European DR trading. Most of the IOB turnover is actually for Russian companies, which were eight of its top ten most actively traded DRs in 2008. In fact, Gazprom was the 4<sup>th</sup> most heavily traded DR in 2008, with total volumes of \$177 billion. The LSE provides continuous electronic trading on an order book similar to SETS, although it additionally permits member firms to display their identity via named orders. For less liquid DRs, there is an auction-only model, which comprises of three daily auctions, cach providing a two-hour call period before the final matching takes place. They offer an International Bulletin Board as well, which allows dedicated market makers to provide liquidity for the electronic trading of certain DRs. The IOB also supplies the trading platform for Luxembourg Stock Exchange listed DRs.

Electronic venues for OTC DR trading have been established as well. In 2007, Pink Sheets LLC (now Pink OTC Markets Inc.) launched the International OTCQX Market, which provides an electronic platform for OTC trading of Level I ADRs. The market comprises of two segments, PremierQX for those companies that meet the U.S. national exchange listing requirements, and PrimeQX for smaller firms. The NASDAQ PORTAL market trading system was also launched in 2007. This provides electronic trading for Rule 144(a) securities, including ADRs. The BNYM (2008) report estimates that around \$141 billion traded on Pink OTC Markets in 2008. They also predict that these levels are likely to rise higher due to the SEC easing of OTC DR listing regulations.

Another interesting innovation in the DR market is ADR Direct from the BNY ConvergEx Group. This platform enables institutional investors to trade stocks overseas and then automatically convert them into ADRs. This handles the FX transaction, and sources liquidity to try to achieve the best price for the ADR. Services such as this should help smooth out any price discrepancies between ADRs and the underlying shares.

# **Exchange Traded Funds**

Investment funds are collective investment schemes. However, they can also be traded as assets. Funds may be categorised as either open-ended or closed-ended. This relates to their size; open-ended funds can continuously expand or reduce, whereas closed-ended funds maintain a fixed size.

Perhaps one of the best-known types of open-ended fund is the U.S. mutual fund. For new investors the fund manager must issue additional shares, whilst for departing investors they must redeem them for cash or securities. Historically, open-ended funds were bought or sold based on the day's close prices.

Closed-ended funds (CEFs) behave more like stocks. There is an initial distribution of a fixed number of shares in the fund, much like an IPO. Subsequently, investors wanting to join or leave the fund will generally need to trade the shares on the secondary markets.

The exchange-traded fund (ETF) was first introduced in the early 1990s. Initially, these were simply open-ended funds which were tradable intraday on the secondary market, just like closed-ended funds. Exchange traded funds are becoming an increasingly popular way for fund managers to gain an overall market exposure, or to provide hedges for risk management. In fact, they have proven to be so successful that a range of closed-ended funds now also class themselves as ETFs.

# **Asset specific**

ETFs are generally classified as either being index or optimised funds. Index funds passively track or replicate a specific benchmark, whilst optimised funds try to heat market henchmarks and so adopt similar techniques to active investors.

Initially, most open-ended ETFs concentrated on major stock indices as their benchmarks. Nowadays, sector specific ETFs are becoming commonplace, as are ETFs containing foreign assets. They are not just restricted to equities; ETFs may also be created based on portfolios of bonds or even commodity futures. Fixed income ETFs are useful because the fund manager is responsible for maintaining the portfolio, so bonds are rolled before they mature and coupon payments are reinvested. Likewise, for commodity ETFs the manager handles the margin requirements and again rolls any contracts hefore expiry.

Optimised ETFs often track custom benchmarks, which are created by applying strict rules and quantitative techniques. This allows them to preserve their transparency. ETFs have even heen created to cater for specific investment styles. For instance, the Claymore MacroShares Oil Down fund comprises of assets that will benefit from a drop in oil prices, whilst their Insider ETF invests in 100 stocks in which insiders have recently been buying.

ETFs offer several advantages to other types of investment funds:

- $\bullet$ Transparency
- Lower fees / overall cost ٠
- ٠ Tax efficiency

In general, ETFs employ fixed compositions, often published daily, so they are more transparent than other types of funds. In comparison, for some actively managed mutual funds or closed-ended funds the publicly available compositions may be months old, in part to protect their investments. ETFs also tend to have lower fees, particularly for the more straightforward index trackers. For instance, the SPDR ETF, which covers the S&P 500 index, has an expense ratio of 9.45 bps, whilst many mutual funds quote an equivalent cost around double this. Meanwhile active funds may charge anywhere from 100-150 bps or

more. Similarly, for bonds, Rebecca Knight (2007) points out that many of the newer ETFs have expense ratios around 20 bps, in comparison to the average annual ratio of 109 bps for typical bond funds. Tax efficiency may also be achieved for stock ETFs, since investors can exit the fund with equivalent positions in the underlying, and so avoid incurring capital gains tax.

## Pricing and trading

The net asset value (NAV) of a fund is simply the total value of all the assets in the fund divided by the number of shares issued. For an open-ended fund the NAV represents the price investors must pay (have redeemed) when they join (or leave), in addition to any fees.

Arbitrage ensures that the market value of the ETF keeps in line with the NAV, since if the ETF trades at a premium (discount) the dealers will just sell (buy) the ETF and buy (sell) the underlying assets. In comparison, closed-end funds may trade at a considerable premium or discount to their NAV, based on analysts/traders estimates for the actual value of their composition. Likewise, ETFs for funds holding foreign assets will tend to trade with a more noticcable difference between their market price and the NAV. This is similar to what we saw for depositary receipts. Variations may be caused by changes in the exchange rate, information flow or simply due to time-zones. For example, some funds will be priced based on stale data, since the native market is closed. Price discrepancies can also be highlight new and forward-looking information. For instance, in a study of Asian ETFs traded in the U.S., Timothy Jares and Angeline Lavin (2002) found that discounts for the ETF were a significant negative predictor for the subsequent daily return in Japan/Hong Kong.

ETFs may be freely bought and sold on the secondary markets throughout the trading day. Unlike mutual funds, they are not subject to any minimum holding periods. They may also be lent, and so allow short sales. All these factors mean that ETFs tend to be much more liquid than any other type of investment fund.

Although ETFs may be traded much like equities, it is still important to remember they are different. Most notably open-ended funds are not subject to a fixed fund size. Instead, an inkind creation and redemption process allows specialised dealers, sometimes known as authorized participants, to react to the demands of the secondary market by trading large blocks of ETFs with the fund sponsor. Therefore, supply and demand have less impact on price than for equities: If demand is outstripping supply the dealers will just create more ETFs, alternatively they can redeem them to reduce the supply. Hence, trading volume is somewhat less important as an indicator for ETFs.

# Global ETF markets

ETFs may be traced back to the TIPS-35 a fund launched in 1990 which tracked the stocks in Canada's TSE 35 index. Some three years later saw the introduction of the now ubiquitous Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts (SPDRs), which track the S&P 500 index of U.S. firms. By 2001, ETFs were well established in North America and Asia and were being introduced across Europe.

A detailed review of the worldwide market is provided by Barclays Global Investors (BGI) (2009): Globally, there are around 1600 ETFs, 472 of these were launched in 2008 with plans to launch another 600 in the near future. Overall, these cover around \$710 billion worth of assets under management. The majority of these investments are equity-based, with over 1300 ETFs, for a total value \$596 billion. Though, fixed income ETFs have steadily grown in popularity, with more than 160 funds and \$104 billion now invested in them. Nearly 50 commodity-based funds have also been established; although investment in them is still much lower, at around \$10 billion. There are also some funds for currencies and mixed investments.

Despite the economic downturn, investment in ETFs is still growing. The BGI (2009) report estimates that the total value invested in them could reach \$2,000 billion by 2011; a similar value was predicted by Morgan Stanley in the FT (2007). This is a comparable rate of growth to that seen for U.S. mutual funds in the 1980s and '90s.

In terms of the investment firms issuing ETFs, the global marketplace is led by Barclays Global Investors (BGI) whose iShares funds account for about 50% of the U.S. and nearly 40% of the European markets, again based on data from the BGI (2009) review. In the U.S., State Street and Vanguard also stand out as major players, although there are 18 fund managers in total. In Europe, there is nearly double the number of providers, but again 80% of the market is catered for by just three, namely BGI, Lyxor Asset Management and Deutsche Bank.

The average daily traded volume for ETFs has also grown significantly, with a global average of \$80.4 billion in 2008, a third higher than the year before, based on BGI (2009). Trading is mainly concentrated at the major stock exchanges, often sharing the same systems as stocks. So the potential for electronic and algorithmic trading is good. Globally, \$10 trillion worth of ETFs were traded on exchanges in 2008, based on figures from the WFE (2009). Table F-2 outlines the top exchanges in terms of volume traded.

# Table F-2 Top exchanges by value of ETFs traded

The U.S. leads the world ETF marketplace, followed by Europe then Asia. Emerging markets, such as Mexico, are also seeing considerable levels of trading. The U.S. market has continued to grow rapidly, with 144 new ETFs issued in 2008 alone, resulting in \$497 billion in assets invested in over 698 funds and an average daily trading volume of \$77 billion, based on data from BGI (2009). ETF trading volumes now account for a sizeable proportion of trading in the U.S. In fact, in 2008 they reached around a third of the total equity trading

volume. During some of the worst market moves in November, ETFs accounted for nearly 40%. Given such volumes, it is hardly surprising that competition for this trade flow is increasing. ETFs are now regularly the most traded assets at many U.S. venues. Note that the bulk of ETF trading in the U.S. is concentrated on a few key funds, as shown in Table F-3. Stock index tracking funds dominate the market, with the ubiquitous "Spiders" for the S&P 500, "Qubes" for the NASDAQ-100, iShares Russell 2000 and the DJIA based "Diamonds".

### Table F-3 Most traded U.S. ETFs for Q4 2008

ETFs were initially championed in the U.S. by the American Stock Exchange (Amex). However, competition soon arrived from the NYSE when unlisted trading privileges meant that venues could trade the same funds without them having to be dual listed. This combined with the NYSE's purchase of Arca has helped make the NYSE the largest venue for ETF trading in the world. NYSE Euronext also took over the Amex in 2008, NYSE ETF trading now uses the ARCA platform where dedicated liquidity providers ensure there is sufficient liquidity. In 2007 NASDAQ launched its own dedicated ETF market; again using designated liquidity providers. Unsurprisingly, other venues such as BATS and the National Stock Exchange (NSX) are also competing for ETF market share.

Europe was slower to embrace ETFs, due to regulatory issues, although since 2000 their uptake has been rapid. In fact, the EDHEC (2006) European ETF survey points out that in 2005 nearly two-thirds of the global market growth was from this region. In 2008, over 630 ETFs were offered in Europe, accounting for more than \$140 hillion of assets and an average daily trading volume of \$2 billion, based on data from BGI (2009).

As we can see from Table F-2, two European exchanges make the top five venues globally. Based on their own figures for Q1 2008, the Deutsche Börse (DBG) (2008) leads with around 37% of the region's market share, followed by Euronext's ETF segment with 34%. Whilst the Borsa Italiana has nearly 13% and the London Stock Exchange has over  $6\%$ . Chi-X also supports ETF trading. The Deutsche Börse XTF platform is essentially hased on Xetra with liquidity provided by Designated Sponsors. A similar approach is adopted for Euronext's ETF segment; both venues also continuously publish indicative NAVs. London's ETF segment is based on their SETS platform. In terms of actual funds, the DAX EX is the most heavily traded, followed by the Dow Jones and iShares Euro STOXX 50 funds. Though, volumes are much lower than those of the giant U.S. funds, for example, the DAX EX has an ADV of about \$375 million. Pan-European and local stock indices are still in the majority, although international and fixed income ETFs are also gaining importance. Commodity funds are increasing as well; in fact, the London Stock Exchange has a dedicated exchange traded commodity (ETC) segment.

The Asian ETF market is noticeably smaller than Europe. BGI (2009) reports a total of 200 ETFs with over \$50 billion invested. More than half of this value is invested in the 61 Japanese ETFs. Japan also leads the way in terms of trading volumes, at both the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges. This has also been helped by cross-listing agreements with the U.S. That said, volumes are increasing across the region, in particular at the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchanges.

# Summary

- Electronic trading is commonplace for many depositary receipts and exchange traded funds, since they are generally traded on the world's stock markets.
- Buy-side levels of adoption of DMA and algorithmic trading for these assets are likely to increase. They may also be incorporated in cross-asset trading strategies.
