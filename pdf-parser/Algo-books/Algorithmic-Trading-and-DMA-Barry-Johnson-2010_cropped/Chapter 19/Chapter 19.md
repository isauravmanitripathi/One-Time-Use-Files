# Appendix C Foreign exchange markets

The foreign exchange (FX) market enables the transfer of money across different currencies. This ranges from spot transactions, which lock-in exchange rate for cash settlement, to forwards, and swaps that arrange transfers for months or even years in the future. This is a huge market, accounting for daily trading volumes of over \$3 trillion. Historically, the FX markets have developed around inter-dealer networks (but not exchanges). Electronic trading has been common for some time in the FX marketplace; direct access trading via DMA and algorithms is also becoming more widespread.

# **Asset specific**

Foreign exchange represents the trading of currencies, essentially by the transfer of ownership of deposits. Therefore, a U.S. dollar / Japanese yen trade consists of one counterparty selling U.S. dollars to another in exchange for a specific amount of yen. For this deal, the exchange rate might be 118.50, which means a single dollar buys 118.5 yen. <sup>12</sup> Generally, exchange rates are expressed in terms of dollars, it is said to be the base currency whilst the other currency is referred to as the quoting or counter currency. Note that British pounds and Australian dollars are an exception to this rule, these also act as base currencies and so the exchange rate is expressed in terms of them.

What we first think of as foreign exchange is spot trading. This corresponds to a cash trade at the current exchange rate, which will usually be settled within two days. FX forwards, or outrights, offer a means of locking-in an exchange rate that will then be used for an exchange at a specified date in the future. Rather than being straight cash transactions, forwards are based on binding contracts. The forward rate will try to reflect the expected future exchange rate, and so it incorporates the volatility of the two currencies. The availability of forwards allows both counterparties to hedge against shifts in the exchange rate; conversely, speculators will try to predict and benefit from them. An FX option is similar, although it gives the purchaser the right to buy or sell, rather than an obligation.

Foreign exchange swaps consist of two legs, a standard spot FX transaction linked with a simultaneous FX forward trade. Initially, the two currencies are exchanged, and when the outright matures, they are swapped back again, at the pre-agreed rate. A currency swap is slightly different since it represents an exchange of interest payments for underlying fixed income assets in two distinct currencies. At maturity, it may also involve exchanging the

notional amount of the underlying fixed income assets. This provides a means for foreign companies to borrow at the more favourable interest rates that are available to domestic companies. Both of these swaps are often used for much longer-term exchanges than FX forwards (years rather than months).

### Pricing and trading

FX trading is largely concentrated on a small subset of currencies. In fact, around two thirds of all trading involves just four major currencies. The 2007 triennial survey by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) (2007b) reports that 86.3% of all transactions involve the U.S. dollar, 37.0% the European euro, 16.5% the Japanese yen and 15.0% the British pound sterling (Bearing in mind that each trade involves two currencies, so the total sums to 200%). In terms of actual currency pairs, they reported that, for the overall turnover in April 2007, 27% was for the U.S. dollar / Euro, followed by 13% for U.S. dollar / Japanese yen and 12% for the U.S. dollar / British pound (known as cable). Emerging market currencies accounted for around 20% of trading.

Pricing foreign exchange rates can be quite difficult, since they are affected by a wide range of economic factors. Traditional exchange rate determination models based solely on macroeconomic factors have failed to explain and forecast fluctuations in exchange rates, This has been clearly noted in studies by Yin-Wong Cheung, Menzie Chinn, and Antonio Garcia-Pascual, (2005) and Richard Meese and Kenneth Rogoff (1983). An alternative method of pricing is to adopt a market microstructure-based approach. This has been pioneered by Martin Evans and Richard Lyons (2002), and Lyons (2001). In these models, macroeconomic information affects exchange rates directly, but also indirectly via order flow, or net buying pressure. Subsequent studies have shown that order flow can both explain and forecast changes in exchange rates. For more information, see the work by Dagfinn Rime, Lucio Sarno and Elvira Sojli (2008) and Evans and Lyons (2005).

Both exchange rates and order flows react to macroeconomic factors such as changes in economic growth, inflation, interest rates or budget/trade balances. Any such information, which might reflect future order flows, can have an important, and often immediate, effect on exchange rates. This can make the trading volumes quite volatile. Indeed, the spot market can vary by up to 30% day to day, as noted by Naureen Malik from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) (2004). Whilst the actual news is publicly broadcast, global order flow is still relatively opaque. Clearly, the major banks have an advantage here since the more clients they have then the more order flow information they possess.

Another factor, which can have a considerable effect on foreign exchange, is the possibility of central bank interventions. Although these may be able to smooth short-term fluctuations, it is just no longer feasible to prop up a currency for any length of time. For instance, the infamous Black Wednesday  $(16^{\text{th}} \text{ September 1992})$  when the U.K. finally announced it was withdrawing from the European exchange rate mechanism. This netted over a billion dollars profit for speculators, who had shorted up to \$10 billion in pounds sterling in the previous two weeks, anticipating of the pound's fall from grace. Central bank intervention is also an interesting signal for investors, since it can indicate future changes in monetary policy.

## Global FX markets

The FX market is enormous; the BIS (2007b) triennial survey reported a total average daily turnover of \$3.2 trillion in 2007 for both spot and "traditional" FX derivative trading

(forwards and FX swaps). This figure increases to around \$3.5 trillion when currency swaps and FX options are included in the total. To put this in perspective, that is well over ten times the daily volume of all the world's stock exchanges. The rapid growth of the FX market is such that the 2007 turnover is nearly double the recorded volume for 2004, and nearly three times the figure for 2001. Estimates for 2009/10 predict this to grow to between \$4-5 trillion. Table C-1 shows a breakdown of this volume by instrument type.

**Table C-1 Average daily FX trading volumes** 

The spot market alone now trades over a trillion dollars every day. FX swaps have higher daily volumes than even OTC interest rate derivatives, making them the world's most heavily traded asset. That said, the 2007-09 financial crisis has certainly had an effect on FX, volumes decreased in the latter part of 2008, but they have started to recover.

In terms of location, London is still the biggest centre of FX trading  $(34.1\%)$  followed by the U.S. (16.6%), Switzerland (6.1%), Japan (6.0%) and Singapore (5.8%). London and Switzerland have seen the most gains in market share since 2004, based on figures from BIS  $(2007b).$ 

The proportion of electronic trading within the FX marketplace is increasing rapidly. In fact, a report from the Aite Group (2007) consultancy notes that it increased from only 22% in 2001 to over 56% by the end of 2006. They predict that this could reach up to 75% by 2010. Likewise, the TABB Group (2007e) consultancy estimates electronic trading reached around 62% by the end of 2006, and should reach 80% by 2010. The adoption of electronic trading is highest in the inter-dealer market. Globally, the Aite Group (2007) found electronic trading levels of around 66% for the inter-dealer market. Data from the U.K. foreign exchange Joint Standing Committee (FX JSC) (2008) shows that 61% of inter-dealer volume was electronic in October 2008. In comparison, the proportion is still lower in the dealer-to-client marketplace. However, buy-side adoption of electronic trading is still increasing. For instance, the annual buy-side FX survey by Greenwich Associates (2007a) found that over 53% reported using e-trading systems for FX. The Aite Group (2007) found 45% electronic trading in the dealer-to-client marketplace. The FX JSC (2008) data shows that 20% of client volume was traded on single broker systems and another 7% on multibroker platforms. <sup>13</sup>

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>13</sup> Although actual levels may be higher since some electronic trading volume may not have been reported as such.

Algorithmic trading is also starting to take hold in FX. Estimates for the total proportion of algorithmic trading are around 7%, with this predicted to rise to up to 15% by 2010, from an Aite Group (2008a) report. The Celent (2007b) consultancy estimates that on some venues algorithmic trading may already account for over 20% of the volume.

The FX marketplace is still segmented with strong inter-dealer networks and separate dealer-to-client markets. Though, inter-dealer trading is declining in importance as the proportion of client-driven trading increases, particularly from hedge funds. The BIS (2007b) survey shows 43% of FX trading was due to inter-dealer activity, down from 59% in 2001. In comparison, trading between dealers and financial institutions increased to 40%, whilst retail FX trading reached 17%.

Over the last few years, the FX marketplace has seen many new entrants. Table C-2 shows estimates of market share for the key participants in both the inter-dealer and dealer-to-client markets, based on data from the TABB Group (2007) consultancy:

#### Table C-2 FX global market share

The inter-dealer market has been dominated by Reuters and EBS (the Electronic Brokers Service) for some time. Whilst this has provided competition, a segregation of the traded currency pairs has occurred. EBS leads for the Euro-Dollar, Dollar-Yen and a range of other Euro based crosses whilst Reuters leads for Sterling-Dollar and for the Euro-Sterling.

Reuters pioneered electronic trading for FX by introducing their monitor dealing service in 1981, based on a "conversational" approach. Effectively, this negotiation is much like the request-for-quote (RFQ) model. Then in 1992, they incorporated a matching service for FX spot orders into the Dealing 2000 platform, and so providing a hybrid order book based execution model. Subsequently, this has been extended to support both forwards and options. They have also introduced an interface designed to cater for algorithmic trading.

EBS was launched in 1993 by a consortium of banks, primarily to compete in the spot marketplace, although it has since been acquired by the inter-dealer broker ICAP. It also provides a hybrid order book marketplace that includes quotes from multiple dealers. EBS is now a major venue for spot FX, trading reached an average of \$217 billion a day in 2008, based on figures from ICAP (2009). Their Spot-API provides an interface specifically catering for algorithmic trading.

In the dealer-to-client space, the large multi-national banks still prevail. Though, competition has meant that the dealer market has continued to consolidate. In fact, the 2008 Euromoney FX poll shows that the five most active banks accounted for just over 60% of the trading, as detailed in Euromoney (2008). These were Deutsche Bank (21.7%), UBS (15.8%), Barclays Capital (9.12%), Citi (7.49%) and RBS (7.3%). The banks offer clients a mix of phone-based trading, dedicated platforms or trading via white label offerings (as services that may then be repackaged by other companies). To compete, Reuters have introduced their Trading for FX platform, and EBS is now available via Bloomberg terminals.

The major banks also participate in the multi-broker dealer-to-client platforms such as FXAll and State Street's FX Connect and Currenex. Generally, these systems all either provide an RFQ market or stream prices direct to clients (RFS). Currenex adopts a hybrid mechanism that also supports limit orders, although there is no visible order book. In terms of trading volume, FXAII achieved average daily volumes of more than \$60 billion in 2008, based on the companies own figures. Estimates from the Celent (2007b) consultancy give FX Connect and Currenex average daily trading volumes in the \$40-50 billion range.

Many of the dealer-to-client platforms do not support anonymous trading, since the client identity is important for credit checking. However, anonymous trading is becoming available to clients, based on prime brokerage style arrangements to address the issue of credit risk. For example, FXAll have extended their streaming prices to support anonymity via their QuickFill mechanism. EBS has also created EBS Prime, which enables financial institutions to trade on their platform. In fact, in 2006 it accounted for over 14% of the average daily volume, according to the Celent (2007b) report.

ECNs have also become established for the FX marketplace, the first was Hotspot FXi. Based around visible, but anonymous, central limit order books these systems are targeting hedge funds, a rapidly growing portion of the marketplace. Hotspot was joined by Lava Trading's LavaFX in 2006, whilst Bloomberg offers Tradebook FX. Similarly, FXAII released its own ECN called Accelor in 2007. FXAll has also signed an agreement to purchase LavaFX, so the FX market is also starting to see some consolidation.

The natural progression of such order book based venues might be to create a dedicated exchange. Indeed, a joint venture between Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange resulted in the creation of FXMarketSpace in 2007. This was the first dedicated FX exchange, catering for both inter-dealer and institutional trading. It was based on a fully electronic order book providing straight-through processing, centralised clearing and settlement (much like the central counterparties for some stock exchanges) and credit checking. Initially, it focussed on spot FX in the six major currencies and six cross-currency pairs, with plans to extend the product to swaps and forward outrights. Unfortunately, the venture failed to meet its targets and so closed down in October 2008.

"Dark pool" ATS and crossing networks have also become available for FX. Instinct's FX Cross, a joint venture with Citigroup, was established in 2002, providing three anonymous crossing sessions a day in 17 currencies. Flextrade's MilanFX, announced in 2007, is the first continuous block trading venue for FX, providing fully hidden crossing for large orders.
