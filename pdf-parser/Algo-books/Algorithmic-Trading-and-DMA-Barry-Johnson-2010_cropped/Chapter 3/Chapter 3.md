# Chapter 3 -**World markets**

Investors, traders and trading systems are increasingly covering multiple markets and asset classes. Therefore, it is important to have a basic grounding in all the major world markets.

#### Introduction 3.1

The world's financial markets are vast, in terms of both their sheer size and the diversity of products they incorporate. Broadly speaking, we can break them down into several main categories, namely the:

- Capital markets ●
- Foreign exchange markets  $\bullet$
- Money markets  $\bullet$
- Derivative markets ٠

The capital markets provide medium and long-term financing via stocks and fixed income assets, whilst the foreign exchange market enables the transfer of money across currencies. Short-term financing is provided in the money markets, which are closely linked to both fixed income and foreign exchange. The derivatives markets provide a means of trading financial contracts, which are in turn based on underlying assets. The underliers may include stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities or even other derivatives. In fact, so much commodity trading is handled via derivatives the commodity market has effectively been subsumed into the derivatives market.

Each market has its own strong identity. Even though many of the same players (brokers and investors) are involved in them, they are still often treated separately. In part, this is due to their different market structures. Conventionally, trading for equities and listed derivatives has centred on exchanges, whilst for many of the other asset classes over the counter (OTC) trading has predominated.

In the following sections, we will briefly cover the main asset class types and how they are traded. We shall then consider some of the major trends that are affecting the world's major markets. Finally, to try to put things in context we will compare the main world markets in terms of their overall sizes, trading volumes and the uptake of electronic and algorithmic trading.

Note that Appendices A-F provide more detailed reviews of each of the major markets. For even more in-depth analysis the reports compiled by consultancies such as the Aite Group, Celent, Greenwich Associates and the TABB Group are invaluable.

#### $3.2$ Asset classes

Financial assets generally provide their issuers with a means of financing themselves, and investors with an opportunity to earn income. For example, stocks represent a share in the firm that issued them, whereas fixed income assets correspond to loans. Foreign exchange is a transfer of cash deposits in different currencies. Derivatives offer a way of trading on the future price of assets, providing both a means of insurance and an opportunity for speculation.

# Equity

Stocks allow companies to finance themselves by actually making their ownership public; each share represents a portion of the firm's inherent value, or equity. This value represents what the corporation's remaining assets are worth once all the liabilities have been deducted. A finite number of shares are issued by public corporations, although they may also choose to issue new ones or buy back some of the outstanding shares. Firms may also make periodic dividend payments to shareholders.

Shares are forward looking investments, since they represent a portion of the firm's total equity. Investors expect the value of their shares to increase or dividends to be paid in order to compensate them for the risk of bankruptcy.

Determining the fair value for equities is non-trivial. Present value theory states that the value of an asset corresponds to a discounted sum of its future payments. This may be based on the present value of their future dividend payments. In turn, this depends on future earnings, which can be difficult to predict. Firms may also choose to reinvest some of their income rather than increasing dividend payouts. Consequently, there are countless different valuation methods that may be applied to companies, each trying to tackle the range of possibilities.

A detailed review of equities and the associated markets may be found in Appendix A.

# **Fixed income**

Fixed income assets, such as bonds, allow both governments and corporations to publicly issue debt for periods of up to 30 years, or even perpetually. The issuer is obliged to repay the holder a specific amount (the principal) at a set date in the future (the maturity date). Many names are given to these assets, but for the purposes of this chapter, we will just use the term bond. The issuer of a bond will usually pay interest (the coupon) to the holder at a given frequency for the lifetime of the loan, e.g. every 6 months. Alternatively, zero coupon bonds make no such payments; instead, their price is discounted by an equivalent amount.

These debts can be issued by governments, other agencies and by companies. They may also be issued based on pools of loans, which is the essence of asset-backed securities. Similarly, mortgage-backed securities are the equivalent for real estate debt. The effective interest rate, which the issuer must pay, depends on the maturity date of the contract as well as their credit rating and the current market rates. Bonds will sometimes have additional collateralization or protection to reduce their credit risk. They may also be differentiated in terms of their seniority when it comes to bankruptcy hearings. An indenture for each contract specifies any additional conditions. All of these features mean that bonds are much more bespoke assets than equities. In fact, there are more than three million different bonds in the U.S alone, which is two hundred times more than the number of equities available globally. This diversity can pose serious liquidity problems, since for many assets it will be difficult to find sufficient depth to support a continuous market.

In general, bonds are more straightforward to price than equities. Essentially, the fair price of a bond is the present value of all its future interest and principal payments. The present value incorporates a discount for the market rate of return, which in turn depends on the bond's characteristics. The risk of default has a considerable impact on the price of bonds, macroeconomic factors, such as inflation expectations, can also have a significant effect.

A more detailed review of bonds and the associated markets may be found in Appendix B.

# Foreign exchange

Foreign exchange (FX) represents the trading of currencies, essentially by transferring the ownership of deposits. Generally, what we first think of as foreign exchange is spot trading. FX spot transactions lock-in the current exchange rate for cash settlement, usually within two days. So a U.S. dollar / Japanese yen trade consists of selling U.S. dollars to another counterparty in exchange for a specific amount of yen.

There are also FX derivative contracts, namely forwards, options and swaps. FX forwards (or outrights) may be used to arrange transfers for months or even years in the future. They are based on binding contracts with a forward rate, which will then be used for an exchange at a specified date in the future. This rate reflects the expected future exchange rate, and so incorporates the volatility of the two currencies. Hence, they offer a means of locking-in an exchange rate. FX options are similar, although they give the purchaser the right to buy or sell, rather than an obligation. An FX swap is slightly more complex since it consists of two legs; a standard spot FX transaction linked with a simultaneous FX forward trade. Initially, the two currencies are exchanged, and when the outright matures, they are swapped back again, at the pre-agreed rate. They are often used for much longer-term exchanges than FX forwards (years rather than months).

Pricing foreign exchange rates can be quite difficult, since they are affected by a wide range of economic factors, such as changes in economic growth, inflation, interest rates or budget/trade balances. Traditional exchange rate determination models based solely on macroeconomic factors have failed to explain and forecast fluctuations in exchange rates. Alternative models have adopted market microstructure based approaches to analyse order flow with some success.

A more detailed review of FX and the associated markets may be found in Appendix C.

## **Money markets**

The money markets are key to the provision of short-term financing for banks, institutions and corporations. This may range from overnight to around a month, although it can be for as much as a year. Typical money market assets are short-term debt, deposits, repos and stock lending. Therefore, the money markets are also closely linked to both fixed income and foreign exchange.

Short-term debt encompasses a range of types, from traditional fixed income contracts to tradable loans/deposits and commercial paper. Government bonds, such as U.S. Treasury bills, provide a comparatively risk-free investment, particularly over the short term. Interbank lending is also an important source of short-term liquidity for banks, particularly overnight. In the U.S., this corresponds to the "Fed funds" depository accounts held with the Federal Rescrve, whilst in Europe it is Eurodollar deposits. There are also secondary markets for negotiable (or tradable) cash deposits and banker's acceptances (or money drafts). Commercial paper is traded as well; this represents unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations as an alternative (and cheaper) means of funding. Although the 2007-09 financial crisis and resultant market turmoil has had a considerable impact on the short-term debt markets.

A repo is the common name for a sale and repurchase agreement. Essentially, this is a secured loan. The seller provides securities in return for cash, but they also commit to repurchase them back on a specified date at a set price. At the agreed maturity date, the seller repays the cash loan together with an interest payment, whilst the securities are returned to them. The interest paid is based on a pre negotiated repo rate, which will often be offset from a benchmark, such as the Fed funds rate. There are two main types of repo: Specific repos are for a certain security. General collateral repos allow the security to be fungible so any acceptable security that meets the set requirements may be used. This flexibility is reflected in a lower lending rate.

Securities (or stock) lending is like a repo without the loan; the securities are simply lent for a fee. As with repos, the type of lending may be classified into general and specific. General lending offers a security that is equivalent to a repo with general collateral, so it just needs to match a set of criteria. Again, the fees for lending depend on the scarcity of the security, so general lending costs significantly less.

A more detailed review of the money markets may be found in Appendix D.

# **Derivatives**

As their name suggests, derivative contracts are derived from other assets, referred to as the underlying assets. Purely financial derivatives were first created in the 1970s. These allowed the underlying assets to expand beyond commodities to also include stocks and stock indices, bonds, currencies or even other derivatives.

The main types of derivative contract are forwards and futures, options, swaps and credit derivatives. They may be classified as either "listed" (or exchange-traded) or over the counter (OTC). Listed derivatives are standardised contracts that may be traded much like stocks; typically, these are futures and options contracts. OTC contracts are bespoke, so they may represent more complex or exotic derivatives contracts.

## **Futures and options**

A forward contract is an agreement to buy (or sell) a fixed quantity of a given asset at a certain price at a specific date in the future, e.g. a contract to buy 5,000 hushels of grain in July for \$3. When the maturity date is reached, the contract expires and the transaction must then be settled. A futures contract is just a forward with standardised terms (e.g. amounts, prices, dates) which is traded on an exchange.

Option contracts are similar to forwards and futures in that they allow a price to be struck to trade a set quantity of a given asset at a specific future date. The settlement price is called the strike price of the option. The premium represents the actual price paid for the option contract. An option to buy is called a call, whilst a contract to sell is a put. Options may also be classified as European or American style. This refers to when they may actually be exercised. American style options may be exercised at any time prior to the expiry date, whereas European style options may only be exercised at maturity.

The main difference between futures (or forwards) and options is that the owner of an option is not obliged to trade. So if the market price is more favourable they may choose not to exercise their option contract (hence its name). Whereas the creator (writer) of the option contract is obliged to trade, should the purchaser wish to do so. Therefore, whilst there may he plenty of investors who want to buy calls or puts much fewer may be prepared to sell

them. Hence, specialised broker/dealers often play a vital role as liquidity providers and market makers.

Pricing these derivatives can be complex. They are obviously based on the price of their underlying asset/s. For instance, a futures contract reflects the expected future value of its underlier discounted to give a present value. Other factors may also need to be considered, such as the interest rate and any additional costs related to storage or transfer (typically for commodity-based contracts), or any potential incomes (e.g. from dividends).

Options are more complex to price than futures, although many standard pricing models exist, such as the ubiquitous Black Scholes equation created by Fisher Black and Merton Scholes (1973). These can compute the fair value of an option based on factors such as the contract's strike price, the underlying asset's market price and its volatility, the time left to expiry and the risk-free interest rate.

# Swaps

A swap is essentially an agreement between two counterparties to exchange cash streams. These may be linked to fixed/floating interest rates, currencies, or even dividend payments. Thus, they offer a flexible means of controlling cash flows, which goes some of the way to explaining their popularity. The commonest type of swap is a straightforward Interest Rate Swap (IRS). A vanilla interest rate swap consists of one leg based on a floating rate of interest whilst the other has a fixed rate. Note that the principal (or notional) amount is not actually exchanged; only the associated interest payments are swapped. A wide range of other swaps may also be traded. For example, basis swaps have both legs based on floating rates. Currency swaps allow firms to borrow in the currency where they can obtain the best interest rate then convert this to the currency they actually need. Total return swaps exchange interest payments for the total return of an asset or basket of assets whilst asset swaps represent the combination of an interest rate swap with a fixed rate bond. There are also many models for pricing swaps, but they are beyond the scope of this book.

## **Credit derivatives**

Credit derivatives act as financial guarantees, which may be used to provide protection against a variety of credit events, but most typically default or bankruptcy. A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract that transfers the credit risk for a notional amount of debt issued by an entity. The purchaser gains protection from this credit risk, whilst the seller is paid regular premiums for the lifetime of the contract. If a credit event occurs then the seller must compensate the purchaser and the contract expires. The typical maturity for a CDS contract is five years. CDS indices expand the scope by covering multiple entities, often encompassing more than a hundred separate companies. They have proven to be incredibly popular, since they allow investors to make much broader macro trades for credit risk. Leading exchanges have also started to offer futures and options based on underlying CDS indices. Again, there are many models for pricing credit derivatives, but they are beyond the scope of this book.

A more detailed review of derivatives and their markets may be found in Appendix E.

# Other asset classes

A few types of financial asset do not quite fit in the main categories. Most notably depositary receipts and exchange traded funds. Both asset classes have seen substantial growth over the last few years.

Depositary receipts (DRs) represent shares in a foreign company. They provide an alternative to cross-border trading, as well as being an important means of accessing the major financial markets for foreign companies. DRs essentially act as proxies for foreign shares that may be traded locally, either at exchanges, other execution venues or OTC. They are issued by a domestic bank or brokerage against their own inventory of the foreign stock. Any dividends are generally paid in the local currency, and for a fee the depositary bank will convert the receipts back into the underlying stock. So, in many respects, these behave much like domestic stocks. Although to gain voting rights, the DR must be part of a sponsored program, since the depositary bank must organise the proxy votes. The two most common types are American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) and global depositary receipts (GDRs). ADRs are traded OTC or on the major U.S. exchanges, whilst GDRs allow trading in more than one country. Pricing these assets is based on the current market price of this underlier. adjusted by the current market exchange rates and any associated fees.

Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a tradable share in an investment fund. Since they represent baskets of assets, they are an extremely efficient means of gaining exposure to whole sectors or markets, much like index futures. ETFs are generally classified as either being index or optimised. Index funds passively track, or replicate, a specific benchmark whilst optimised funds try to beat the benchmark and so adopt similar techniques to active investors. Note that ETFs are not just restricted to equities; they may also be created hased on portfolios of bonds or even commodities. In terms of valuation, the net asset value (NAV) of a fund is essentially the total value of all the assets in the fund divided by the number of shares issued. Because of their inherent transparency, the NAV is easily calculated, although for funds holding foreign assets differences in time zones and FX rates can lead to discrepancies between the market price and the NAV.

A more detailed review of the markets for these asset types may be found in Appendix F.

#### 3.3 Market structure

In Chapter 2, we covered the basic trading mechanisms, specifically quote-driven and orderdriven execution. Initially, most markets begin with quote-driven trading. For instance, imagine an exotic new class of asset: To start off the market is so specialised that there may only be a single dealer prepared to "make a market" for this. Any trading is invariably a oneto-one process between the dealer and each client (investor), as shown in Figure  $3-1(a)$ .

Gradually the number of investors (or potential clients) will increase and so more dealers will get involved. This enables clients to check prices with several dealers before deciding to trade, as shown in Figure 3-1(b). Trading is still bilateral and quote-driven, but at least there is more choice. This type of structure is the basis for much of the "over the counter" (OTC) trading which takes place for a wide range of assets, from stocks to bonds and derivatives.

Eventually the marketplace may become so large that there is enough trading (and participants) to warrant dedicated execution venues, as shown in Figure 3-1(c). Historically, inter-dealer networks started out as organised exchanges, whilst dealer-to-client communications were handled by brokers. Over time, these have increasingly shifted to phone-based and/or screen-based electronic trading platforms.

Trading for many of the world's assets is now based on market structures similar to Figure 3-1(c). For highly standardised assets, such as equities, trading has continued to develop around exchanges, whilst for less standardised ones, such as bonds or complex derivatives, much of the trading is carried out OTC or via specialised inter-dealer brokers (IDBs).

Figure 3-1 Three phases of marketplace development

Table 3-1 tries to provide a broad summary of these market structures for the major asset classes, although inevitably there are some isolated exceptions.<sup>1</sup>

| Asset class         | Inter-dealer | Dealer-to-client         | Alternative  |

# Table 3-1 Market structure across asset classes

Over the last few years, the strict segmentation between the dealer and client markets, visible in Figure 3-1, has started to blur. Alternative trading venues (accessed by both dealers and clients) have become increasingly important. They are the Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) or Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs) and "dark pool" Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) which have started to spread across the world's markets. These further complicate the market structure, to the point where clients may even use certain venues to bypass dealers altogether. We shall consider the impact of these alternatives in some more detail after a brief review of the inter-dealer and dealer-to-client markets.

# Inter-dealer markets

A strong inter-dealer market is vital for liquidity. Otherwise, dealers may be less willing to trade beyond their current inventory. Having a market where they can easily trade with other dealers enables them to control their positions and so meet their clients' requirements.

 $1$  For instance, some exchanges provide trading platforms for bonds and repos.

Many of the differences between the world's inter-dealer markets are historical. Exchange-based trading was originally based on open outcry auctions, and so the mechanism was order-based. In comparison, OTC trading is often bilateral and so quote-driven. However, the advent of electronic trading has resulted in many of the exchanges and interdealer brokers moving to platforms based on electronic order books. In fact, nowadays there are a lot more similarities between inter-dealer markets.

#### Exchanges

Exchanges are probably the best-known venue for trading. The world's oldest exchanges mainly date back to the 17<sup>th</sup> or 18<sup>th</sup> centuries, although organised exchanges may be traced back as far as the  $13^{\text{th}}$  century.

Trading on exchanges is carried out by its members, who are primarily specialised dealing houses or broker/dealer firms. Historically, regulation and the costs of maintaining a presence on trading floors have ensured that exchanges remained the domain of dealers and brokers. Increasingly, though, brokers are offering their clients DMA access to exchanges. Likewise, memberships are not limited to dealers; so large investors, who can justify the cost, can gain access by buying a membership. That is why the market segmentation is not quite as black and white as suggested by Figure  $3-1(c)$ .

As we saw in Table 3-1, exchange-based trading is generally adopted for more standardised assets. The largest markets are for equities and listed futures and options, but exchanges are also used to trade fixed income, money market and other types of asset. Table 3-2 gives some examples for the various asset classes and regions.

| Asset class     | Venues                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Table 3-2 Example exchanges by asset class

Traditionally, the world's exchanges have been centred on floor-based open-outcry auctions. Some venues still feature this; however, over the last few years electronic order books have now become the norm for most of the major trading centres. In terms of the actual trading mechanism, exchanges' electronic trading platforms are generally based on central limit order books, often allowing anonymous trading. For liquid assets, this means continuous auctions, as we saw in Chapter 2. Call auctions are used for less liquid assets, and are often adopted for the opening and closing periods to reduce volatility. Conventionally, stock markets have tended to adopt a price/time based priority for their trade matching, whilst listed derivatives exchanges have often used a price/pro-rata based approach. That said, such distinctions are becoming increasingly blurred. For instance, in the U.S. the NYSE and NASDAQ stock markets have both launched their own dedicated equity options exchanges based on a price/time priority.

Stock exchanges have generally focussed on domestic trading, in part due to the higher level of regulation associated with equities. Still, over the last few years demutualization has seen many of the world's major exchanges become standalone corporations. In order to survive in the increasingly competitive markets, there has been wave after wave of global mergers and consolidations. Most notably, the mergers between the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Euronext, and NASDAQ and the OMX, have created two massive entities competing for both U.S. and European volume. Global competition is likely to continue to increase over the coming years. Local competition has also been triggered by regulation. In the U.S., the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced NASDAQ order handling rules in 1997, which helped spur new execution venues (the ECNs). 2007 saw Regulation NMS, which was introduced to improve competition; offering order protection at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) for orders on the major U.S. stock exchanges and ECNs. Although competition has increased, the available liquidity has become more fragmented. Likewise, in Europe, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) regulations introduced in 2007 sought to encourage competition (and to regulate) off-exchange trading in the form of Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), which are broadly similar to ECNs. Although some time behind the U.S., the European markets are also starting to become fragmented, as competition takes liquidity away from the major exchanges. A more detailed review is provided in Appendix A.

In comparison, the exchanges for listed derivatives have faced global competition for some time. U.S. and European exchanges have often launched rival contracts to try to grab liquidity from each other. Computerisation has also helped turn this into virtually a 24-hour marketplace. The U.S. equity option marketplace has become one of the most competitive market places in the world, where options may be traded on any one of seven exchanges. Certainly, the U.S. equity options marketplace has seen some of the highest levels of growth of any of the world's listed derivatives markets. This highlights the benefits of a common clearing mechanism and assets that are readily transferable.

Exchange-based trading is also important for other assets, particularly ADRs and ETFs. They may not have their own dedicated exchanges, but they contribute considerable flow to the world's stock exchanges. In fact, in the U.S. leading ETFs such as the SPDR are often the most traded assets on the major exchanges. Fixed income bonds are also traded on some stock and listed derivative exchanges.

Exchanges are facing increased competition; however, the safety offered by centralised clearing and settlement means that other asset classes will no doubt continue to consider exchange or exchange-like market structures in the future.

#### OTC/Inter-dealer broker networks

For assets that are generally traded over the counter (OTC), the inter-dealer networks have often developed in a less centralised fashion than exchange-based markets. Instead of being based around physical locations, they have evolved from phone-based trading between dealers and specialised inter-dealer brokers (IDBs). Over time, phone (or voice) based trading has been augmented by dedicated electronic trading platforms, particularly for the more liquid assets. Table 3-3 gives some examples for the various asset classes and regions.

A range of mechanisms is used for inter-dealer trading. Many platforms start out by aggregating dealers' quotes. Since a firm quote is effectively a limit order, some have evolved to offer full order book based-functionality. Several IDBs have even started to

incorporate this with their voice-based OTC liquidity to create hybrid trading systems.

In fixed income, government bonds generally have the highest liquidity since they tend to be more standardised and often have the highest demand. The best example of this is the U.S. Treasury market. Inter-dealer brokers such as ICAP and BGC offer both phone-based and electronic trading platforms for Treasuries, together with a wide range of other fixed income assets. Indeed, as Larry Tabb (2004) points out, IDBs have effectively taken the place of exchanges for many U.S. bonds. In Europe, a considerable proportion of government bonds are traded over the MTS (Mercato Telematico dei Titoli di Stato) and Euro MTS platforms, which aggregate quotes from all the major dealers. Competition from dedicated IDBs has been somewhat less in Europe. In part, this is because primary dealerships have often been awarded based on trading on local platforms. So there has been less incentive for dealers to use alternatives. That said, treasury agencies have started to formally recognise alternatives, such as BGC's European Government platform, so competition in this space may well increase over the next few years.

Foreign exchange also has a well-established electronic inter-dealer marketplace. Reuters first introduced a monitor-based dealing service back in 1981. Over time, this has evolved into a hybrid order book based trading platform. It was joined by EBS in 1993, which was launched by a consortium of banks, and is now part of ICAP. Between them, these two platforms cater for much of the inter-dealer trading in the FX marketplace.

Unsurprisingly, the major players in fixed income and FX also provide platforms for money market trading. ICAP's BrokerTec and BGC's eSpeed platforms cater for short-term debt and repos in the U.S., whilst MTS and ICAP are important for European debt and repos. For the overnight Fed funds market, ICAP also offers the i-Feds platform. In Europe e-MID offers a platform for trading deposits.

OTC derivatives are catered for as well. For example, ICAP brokerage's i-Swap provides a platform for electronic swap trading, as does the CME's Swapstream. EuroMTS has also launched a dedicated swap market for trading overnight interest rate swaps (EONIAs). Credit default swaps are starting to see dedicated trading platforms as well. For example, Creditex's RealTime, GFI's CreditMatch and ICAP's BrokerTec all cater for CDSs.

### Dealer-to-client markets

Traditionally, bridging the gap between dealers and clients has been the domain of brokers. Nowadays dealer-to-client (D2C) markets are represented by a mix of phone-based trading, single and multi-broker/dealer electronic trading platforms, provided by a range of brokers and third-party vendors. Table 3-4 shows some examples.

| Asset class                                      | Platforms                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Equities,<br>Listed futures/options,<br>DRs/ETFs | Broker or vendor OMSs                                     |
| Fixed income                                     | Tradeweb, Bloomberg BondTrader, Reuters RTFI, MarketAxess |
| Foreign exchange                                 | Bank platforms, FXAII, State Street FX Connect, Currenex  |
| Money market                                     | Tradeweb, Bloomberg BondTrader, State Street FX Connect   |
| Swaps                                            | Tradeweb, Bloomberg SwapTrader, CME sPro                  |
| Credit default swaps                             | Tradeweb, MarketAxess                                     |

#### Table 3-4 Example dealer-to-client trading platforms by asset class

The mechanism for these trading platforms depends on the underlying inter-dealer market. With exchange-based markets, they are generally order-based. Whilst on OTC markets, the D2C platforms are quote-based, and so they tend to adopt the request for quote (RFQ) or request for stream (RFS) mechanisms we saw in Chapter 2.

For equities, listed futures and options, depositary receipts and ETFs, broker and/or vendor Order Management Systems (OMSs) are the mainstay for providing D2C trading. These offer a suite of appropriate tools for pre- and post-trade handling. The broker may provide DMA as well. They may also cater for OTC trading of these assets.

Fixed income platforms, such as Tradeweb, Bloomberg's BondTrader and Reuter's RTFI trading system, offer electronic trading via RFQ. Further competition should have arrived in the form of LiquidityHub, which was to provide clients with a stream-based trading mechanism for government honds, aggregating the liquidity from a consortium of over a dozen banks. Unfortunately, the 2007-09 financial crisis put an end to this venture.

In foreign exchange, the large multi-national banks provide their own client trading platforms. There are also important multi-broker platforms, such as FXAII and State Street's FX Connect and Currenex. Generally, these systems all either provide access via RFQ or RFS. Currenex actually uses a hybrid mechanism that also supports limit orders, although there is no visible order book.

Again, the major fixed income platforms, such as Tradeweb and Bloomberg, also support money markets trading. Similarly, foreign exchange platforms, such as FXAII and Currenex, have expanded to incorporate money market trading.

For OTC derivatives, there is a mix of single and multi-dealer platforms. Swap trading is supported by Tradeweb, Bloomberg's SwapTrader and Reuters Matching for Interest Rates. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is also introducing sPro, a dealer-to-client version of Swapstream. Credit default swaps are supported by MarketAxess and Tradeweb.

## Alternative markets

Alternative trading venues have become more and more important over the last few years. Many of these venues serve both the buy and sell-side, so they effectively straddle the strict segmentation we saw back in Figure 3-1. Hence, market structures are becoming increasingly complex, as we can see in Figure 3-2.

Broker/dealers have started to provide DMA access to exchanges and other execution venues (shown as the grey dashed line). Clients can also get direct access to many of the ECNs and ATSs; so they are no longer restricted to dealer-to-client platforms.

![](_page_11_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 3-2 Marketplace interconnections for alternative venues

In fact, some ATSs are buy-side only, completely bypassing the broker/dealers. Effectively, these are client-to-client trading networks. In section 3.4 we will revisit this increased accessibility, but first let's briefly review the different types of alternative execution venue.

# ECNs/MTFs

Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs) are probably the best-known off-exchange trading venues. They started in the U.S. equity marketplace; however, they have since spread to many of the world's markets. Table 3-5 gives some examples.

| Asset class      | Venues                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equities         | U.S.: Bloomberg Tradebook<br>Europe: Chi-X, Turquoise      |
| Foreign exchange | Hotspot FXi, LavaFX, Bloomberg Tradebook FX, FXAII Accelor |
| Money market     | Securities lending: SecFinex                               |

### Table 3-5 Example ECNs/MTFs by asset class

In terms of their mechanism, ECNs are generally based on central limit order books, with continuous auctions that usually allow anonymous trading. So they are very similar to exchanges.

ECNs came about through the quote ruling introduced in 1997 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Previously, dealers had been able to use private inter-dealer systems to trade at better prices than on NASDAQ; the new ruling meant that these prices should also be available to the public. In effect, this opened a window for external execution venues, and suddenly a series of new ECNs were created. By the millennium, there were over a dozen ECNs, all vying for market share in U.S. equities. Since then, the competition has increased, but there has been a lot of consolidation. Indeed, of the original four ECNs founded, only Bloomberg Tradebook remains as such. Two of the main ECNs, BATS and Direct Edge, have either become exchanges in their own right or are in the process of doing so.

Europe is starting to see the same level of intense competition as experienced in the U.S. In the past, pan European execution venues had mixed success; though, some have flourished, such as Chi-X. The introduction of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), in 2007, aimed to encourage competition between trading venues, improve pre and post-trade transparency and enforce "best execution" requirements. Its immediate effect was the creation of a range of new venues. These are classified as Systematic Internalisers (SIs), for single-broker platforms, or as multi-broker Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), such as Turquoise. Hence, the major exchanges now have to compete for liquidity, although this has led to the marketplace becoming more fragmented.

ECNs have also become established in the FX marketplace, the first was Hotspot FXi. Based around visible, but anonymous, central limit order books, these systems are targeting hedge funds, a rapidly growing portion of the marketplace. Hotspot was joined by Lava Trading's LavaFX in 2006, FXAII have also released their Accelor ECN, whilst Bloomberg have launched Tradebook FX.

Centralised order-driven markets are also starting to appear for other asset classes, such as securities lending and OTC DR trading.

## "Dark pool" ATSs

As their moniker suggests, Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) provide opaque order-driven trading platforms that help to aggregate pools of liquidity. They have proved popular because they allow buy and/or sell-side traders to place large orders without them being seen by other market participants, and so reducing market impact costs.

ATSs actually cover quite a diverse range of market types. Table 3-6 provides a summary of these. As we saw in Chapter 2, markets may be classified in terms of whether trade matching is scheduled or is continuous. ATSs may also be distinguished in terms of their crossing. They either adopt a standard auction or use negotiated, advertised or internal crossing mechanisms. Constant market evolution means hybrids of these crossing types are also developing.

| Frequency  | <b>Crossing Mechanism</b> |  |
|------------|---------------------------|--|
| Scheduled  | Auction                   |  |
| Continuous | Blind auction             |  |
|            | Negotiated                |  |
|            | Advertised                |  |
|            | Internal                  |  |

#### Table 3-6 ATS classifications

The mechanics of price discovery vary for each type of ATS as well. Some do not incorporate their own mechanism; instead, orders are matched at the mid-point price taken from the main market, c.g. the U.S. NBBO. Others contain full order book functionality and so determine their own prices when matching.

Scheduled crosses are in effect equivalent to scheduled anonymous call auctions. For instance, for U.S. equities ITG's POSIT offers a dozen separate intraday crosses together with two after the close. Each cross is a call auction priced at the midpoint of the NBBO.

Continuous blind crosses, such as Instinet's CBX, offer trading on a completely opaque electronic order book. Effectively, it is like trading on an exchange where all the orders are hidden. Some of these venues also offer "pass through" orders that first try to match with the liquidity available within the ATS before being routed on to their intended destination, whether that is a primary/regional exchange, ECN or another ATS. These have proven to be an important additional source of liquidity.

Negotiated crossing platforms constantly search for potential matches notifying each participant when one is found. This then allows them to enter into an anonymous bilateral negotiation for both the size and price. Liquidnet is probably the best-known example, it employs a scorecard (like eBay's ratings) to reflect each users history of successful crossings.

Advertised crossing systems highlight when liquidity is present, although they do not give away sizes. For example, Pipeline maintains a block-board of stocks, which are highlighted in orange when liquidity is present. Block price ranges are available as a guideline and no sizes are displayed. Users may then place firm orders to execute with this liquidity.

Brokers' own crossing networks generally adopt a similar mechanism to the continuous blind crossing platforms. Originally, these were just internal crossing networks, allowing them to save the fees from executing on exchanges. However, they have rapidly become a considerable force in terms of "dark pool" liquidity.

Although ATSs started in the U.S. equities markets, most of the major operators are now also present in the European and Asian markets. ATSs are also starting to appear for other asset classes, Table 3-7 shows some examples.

| Asset class      | Venues                                                                                                                              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Equities         | ITG POSIT (Scheduled), Instinct CBX (Blind), Liquidnet (Negotiated),<br>Pipeline (Advertised), Credit Suisse CrossFinder (Internal) |
| Foreign exchange | Instinct FX Cross (Scheduled), Flextrade MilanFX (Advertised)                                                                       |
| Options          | U.S.: Archangel ATS (Blind), Ballista (Hybrid/negotiation)                                                                          |

#### Table 3-7 Example ATSs by asset class

For foreign exchange, Instinct's FX Cross, a joint venture with Citigroup, provides three anonymous crossing sessions a day in 17 currencies. Flextrade also offer MilanFX, a continuous block-trading venue for FX. Similarly, U.S. listed options are also getting their own ATSs: Pipeline Archangel provides a blind auction for listed options, similarly Ballista offer a hybrid option ATS combining auctions with electronic negotiations. LiquidityPort has also announced plans to offer an electronic block-trading platform for both futures and options contracts.

#### 3.4 Global market trends

There are certainly differences amongst the world's major markets; however, there are also many similarities. A focus on costs, by both the buy- and sell-sides, and the onward march of technology mean that the markets for each asset class are exhibiting many of the same trends, albeit at different rates. Notably, many of the markets are seeing increases in:

- Electronic trading
- $\bullet$ Transparency
- $\bullet$ Accessibility

Electronic trading is already widespread; indeed, for many markets it is now the norm. Transparency is also improving, for both pre- and post-trade information. Accessibility has also become a key issue as buy-side traders seek to gain access to the same venues as their sell-side counterparts.

![](_page_14_Figure_2.jpeg)

Figure 3-3 Common global market trends

Running alongside these trends is a seemingly endless cycle of centralisation and fragmentation, as shown in Figure 3-3. New venues keep appearing, attracting order flow and fragmenting the available liquidity. Then within a few years, consolidation means the market starts to centralise again.

## Electronic trading

Electronic trading is now commonplace for most asset classes, in particular for more standardised assets. A large number of electronic platforms exist, providing inter-dealer and dealer-to-client trading for both exchange-based and OTC markets.

Technology has substantially lowered the barriers to market entry. New entrants such as the ECNs and ATSs have had a huge impact, particularly in the U.S. equities market. Capturing liquidity from established market centres can be extremely difficult and expensive. Still, electronic trading has proven to be a powerful tool in achieving this. For instance, in carly in 1997 the DTB (now Eurex) had around a quarter of the market with its Euro-Bund futures contract. A new electronic trading platform helped it win back market leadership from Liffe, by the end of the year its market share had reached 90%.

Competition has forced dealers and exchanges to shift to electronic platforms in order to achieve cost reductions and to increase the capacity for trading volume. In the exchangebased markets, there has been a considerable migration from floor-based to electronic trading. Even the most successful trading floors, such as the NYSE and the CME, have now fully embraced electronic trading.

The advent of electronic trading has also led to irrevocable changes in the global markets. Most notably in terms of:

- $\bullet$ Speed/Latency
- $\bullet$ Order size
- Growth in volumes

Order placement and execution times are now measured in fractions of a second. In comparison, the old U.S. equity inter-market system (ITS) allowed dealers up to 30 seconds. We are currently in the midst of a race between venues to provide the fastest platforms. A few years ago, a latency, or delay, of 300 milliseconds  $(10^{-3}s)$  used to be perfectly reasonable. Nowadays cutting-edge venues are targeting latencies in microseconds  $(10^{-6}s)$ . In the light of this, co-location services are becoming increasingly popular. These allow market participants to host their computerised trading systems in the same machine rooms as the execution venue, thus minimising any transmission-related delays.

Average order sizes have seen considerable shifts as well. In some markets, such as FX and U.S. listed options, order sizes are actually increasing, in order to cope with the huge increases in trading these markets are experiencing. However, the longer-term effect of electronic trading is probably best illustrated by the equity markets. Over the last ten years, there has been a steady decline in average order sizes on electronic trading platforms for equities. For example, in the late 1980s the average order size on NYSE was nearly 2,500 whereas now it hovers at around 300. A noticeable decline occurred with the introduction of decimalisation in 2001, as shown in Figure 3-4, based on data for the average trade sizes from the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). This trend becomes selfperpetuating as traders progressively adopt order slicing and algorithmic trading strategies in order to minimise market impact. A similar decline is taking place in order sizes for the listed futures markets; in fact single contract orders are becoming commonplace.

#### Figure 3-4 Average trade sizes for U.S. equities

Trading volumes have also rocketed over the last few years, in part due to the easy access and lower costs afforded by electronic trading. Much of this is due to the influx of trading from hedge funds. Although investment firms across the board are adopting a much wider range of assets, particularly derivatives.

The ratio of orders to executions has also changed, with electronic platforms having to cope with a much higher level of order placements, modifications and cancellations than ever before.

Pandora's Box has been opened. Markets will continue to evolve in order to adapt to the changes which electronic trading brings. Algorithmic trading is a key tool to help cope with these changes.

# Transparency

Transparency plays an important part in improving execution quality. It is also a key factor in reflecting the accessibility of markets. Pre- and post-trade information is vital for effective trading. Venues need to provide timely data on the size and price of orders/quotes/trades, as well as the time of executions. Historically, quote-driven or OTC markets have tended to be much less transparent than order-driven ones.

Post-trade transparency is well established for exchange-based markets. But it is also improving for OTC markets. For instance, in the U.S., the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) initiative has mandated reporting of trade prices for corporate debt since 2001. This may well expand to include primary market, government agency and debt from the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). In Europe, MiFID has mandated reporting for OTC equity trades. This may also spread to encompass other European asset classes, such as bonds and OTC derivatives.

Pre-trade transparency poses more issues, since for OTC markets only the broker/dealers' best bid and offer are available. Multi-broker platforms/markets improve this slightly by making it easier to discover and to compare quotes from a range of market makers. In comparison, exchanges and other execution venues based on electronic order books are capable of much more transparency. They may allow the best five bids and offers or even the entire order book to be viewed.

Conversely, there is also a global trend for more pre-trade anonymity. Whilst transparency is important to see the currently available prices and liquidity, it can also pose problems for participants who need to trade larger quantities. Signalling risk represents the information that may be given away by such large orders. Pre-trade anonymity helps reduce the signalling risk, as can the adoption of order splitting or algorithmic strategies. Anonymity is generally only offered by order-driven venues and a few multi-broker platforms. This is because prime-brokerage type agreements and central counterparties are available, which help to reduce the potential credit and settlement risk. So for most OTC trading the only client protection is still the two-way quote.

A justification for these seemingly opposing trends in transparency and anonymity is provided by Robert Schwartz and Michael Pagano (2005). They point out that whilst transparency is required for price discovery, opacity is required for quantity discovery. This explains the popularity of "dark pool" ATSs which allow participants to anonymously trade in size. Ironically, some of the success of the "dark pools" is due to the transparency of the primary exchanges. Since, in general, they match based on size, using prices discovered from the primary exchange. Thus, dark pools have so far been concentrated in markets where prices are readily available, such as the equities markets. They are also starting to be introduced for the FX and listed derivatives markets. Negotiation based "dark pools" could be established for other asset classes, albeit with the additional burden of price discovery.

# Accessibility

Traditionally, the marketplaces for most assets have been split into two, between dealers and clients, as we saw in section 3.3. Electronic trading has blurred these boundaries, creating much more open marketplaces. Screen trading has helped lower the cost of access to the inter-dealer network: Once an electronic trading platform is established, accessibility is no longer about being able to support a physical presence on a trading floor. Suddenly, there is a lot less difference between the buy-side and the sell-side. Remote access has also meant that location and time-zones start to become less important.

The advent of hedge funds has seen a concerted push by the buy-side to gain access to trade on the exchanges and dedicated inter-dealer networks. For large investment firms, the costs of electronic membership to exchanges can be worthwhile as a means of reducing broker/dealer commissions. Alternatively, many brokers have extended their agency-based trading to support DMA, providing clients with a low-cost means of sending orders to the exchanges. Even some of the dedicated inter-dealer platforms for bonds and FX have started to provide access for hedge funds and other investment firms.

Many new venues, such as ECNs and ATSs, cater for dealers and clients alike, as shown in Figure 3-2. Broker/dealers have also started to group together to create new venues, which are competing head-to-head with exchanges. So the segmentation between dealers and clients is weakening, although admittedly it is happening a lot slower for the traditionally OTC markets.

![](_page_17_Figure_4.jpeg)

Figure 3-5 Potential marketplace inter-connections

Figure 3-5 tries to illustrate this more fluid market structure. Note the term execution venue is used to represent the whole range of exchanges, ECNs, ATSs and other platforms that now span the gap between dealers and clients.

Final proof that competition has improved accessibility is the establishment of inter-client networks, such as the buy-side only ATSs, which allow much larger trades than are possible on the open market. This is because the clients are trading with each other in an opaque venue, so signalling risk is less of an issue. Prior to this, such orders would have been handled by specialised block trading dealers in the "upstairs" market. Consequently, the advent of buy-side only "dark pools" has improved accessibility for this hidden liquidity.

# **Centralisation versus fragmentation**

Constant competition means that markets often wax and wane between centralisation and fragmentation, as we saw in Figure 3-3. Although gauging exactly where a market lies between these two extremes is still more of a qualitative exercise than a quantitative one.

Fragmentation makes price discovery more difficult, so it is hard to be sure whether best execution has been achieved. Conversely, the lack of competition in a monopoly can also lead to increased costs. So the middle-ground is likely to provide the fairest solution. Though, as Figure 3-6 tries to show, it is still unclear exactly what form this should take.

![](_page_18_Figure_1.jpeg)

Figure 3-6 Centralisation versus fragmentation

By its very nature, OTC based trading is much more fragmented than exchange-based trading. The ideal marketplace is probably some sort of hybrid of these two, capturing the best features of both. It should be able to support both principal and agency-based trading. as well as allowing both direct execution and negotiation for clients.

#### Centralisation

Trading is easier, and usually cheaper, in liquid markets. This leads to a "network effect" which means venues with sufficient liquidity tend to retain and even attract new trade flow. There is a natural tendency for markets to centralise, as market liquidity tends to be "sticky". Hence, the success of the world's major exchanges. Even OTC markets are focussed around a number of major broker/dealers who have demonstrated they can provide sufficient liquidity.

Centralisation may arise from regulation. For example, in 1963, the SEC recommended restructuring OTC stock trading; this led to the creation of NASDAQ. In Europe concentration regulations were used (by France, Spain and Italy) to prevent significant offexchange trading, until the introduction of MiFID. Indeed, for many countries the main national exchange often handles most of the trading for shares in domestic firms. Therefore, the stock exchange is still often viewed as the embodiment of centralisation.

Competition can also lead to centralisation. Over the last ten years, the average cost of trading has substantially decreased (except during the 2007-09 financial crisis). Reduced margins for broker/dealers mean that cost reductions from economics of scale are vital. Thus, consolidation tends to occur; the successful broker/dcalers get larger and the rest either try to compete with innovations and incentives, or shift their focus to other markets. Key interdealer brokers, such as ICAP and BGC, dominate electronic trading in U.S. fixed income. Whilst in Europe the MTS and Euro MTS platforms handle a considerable proportion of government bond trading. In the FX market, the top ten banks now account for nearly 80% of the trading.  $2$ 

Demutualization and global competition have led to a wave of exchange mergers and alliances. For instance, Euronext merged with NYSE, although previously there had been talk of a link with the Deutsche Börse. Similarly, NASDAQ bought the OMX, although they were previously focussed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The LSE in turn was busy planning a takeover of the Borsa Italiana. So there are now two massive entities competing for both U.S. and European volume, namely NYSE Euronext and NASDAQ OMX. Whilst in the derivatives markets, the CME and CBOT have also merged in order to maintain their global position versus other exchanges, such as Eurex and Liffe. Global competition is likely to continue to increase over the coming years, particularly as more pan-European (and even pan-Asian) execution venues are established.

Note that centralisation does not just apply to execution venues, clearance and settlement

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>2</sup> As reported in the 2008 Euromoney FX poll (Euromoney (2008)).

procedures should be considered as well. Having a single depository, such as the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC), makes settlement much more straightforward. Centralisation has also proved successful for FX, based on the CLS settlement system. However, this is a more complex issue for the OTC markets. The 2007-09 financial crisis showed how vulnerable they could be. Over the next few years, it is likely that regulation will mandate more centralisation for these. Streamlining the clearing and settlement processes could realise meaningful cost savings and help improve liquidity. Adopting central counterparties reduces counterparty risk. Still, this is only viable if the risk is readily quantifiable, otherwise the clearinghouses may be over exposed. Valuation is much less certain for more complex and less liquid assets. Therefore, a degree of standardisation might also be required. In fact, this process has already begun for CDSs, with several exchanges setting up clearing houses for them. If the OTC markets yield to the pressure to change then their liquidity may well improve. These measures could lead to lower transaction costs. Centralised clearing would allow participants more flexibility in managing collateral, by netting their exposures. Prime brokerage type arrangements could be established to help control credit risk. All these measures are the precursors to pre-trade anonymity, and so they might even lead to new electronic trading venues for OTC assets.

## Fraamentation

Fragmentation is often referred to with sinister undertones. That said, it is an important part of the cycle of competition. Too little would mean the markets become huge monopolies, with no opposition to help reduce fees. On the other hand, too much fragmentation and we have a free-for-all that would make even the OTC markets seem centralised.

Regulation can also encourage fragmentation, by aiming to reduce costs with increased competition. For example, the SEC's 1997 NASDAQ quote ruling helped launch the ECN as a competitor. By the millennium, there were over a dozen ECNs trading U.S. equities. Similarly, 2007 saw the introduction of MiFID in Europe, leading to the creation of ECNlike MTFs and Systematic Internalisers. Indeed, pan European execution venues are starting to flourish, directly competing with the major stock exchanges. Still, Europe is inherently more fragmented than the U.S. since there are not yet regulations for a European-wide Best Bid and Offer (EBBO) or Regulation NMS style order routing requirements. Clearing and settlement is also more complicated in Europe.

To attract liquidity, new market entrants obviously need to offer something special. For ECNs, it was the electronic order book and the possibility of trading at a better price than the major markets. ATSs offer the ability of anonymous crossing large orders with minimal impact. Continued survival means retaining this liquidity and attracting more. Hence, innovation is not always enough, price incentives may also be required. For example, BATS captured a significant share of NASDAQ volume by offering a series of price rebates.

Fragmentation is also affecting other asset classes, such as foreign exchange. ICAP's EBS and Reuters still dominate the inter-dealer market. However, the last few years have seen fresh competition from ECNs such as Hotspot FXi, LavaFX, Bloomberg Tradebook FX and Accolor. "Dark pool" ATSs, such as MilanFX, have also started to appear.

The listed derivative markets are affected as well. Since most of these contracts are not transferable (or fungihle) between venues, fragmentation means multiple venues offering similar contracts for the same underlying. Often this competition has been global, such as between the CME, Eurex and Liffe. However, local competition has also arrived, particularly in the U.S. with venues such as NYSE Liffe U.S. and the Electronic Liquidity Exchange (ELX). An important exception is the U.S. equity options market, which has a common

clearing mechanism. This may be traced back to changes in market regulation (in 1994) ensuring that these could be traded at any of the market centres rather than concentrated at specific venues. Trading for U.S. equity options is now spread amongst more than half a dozen venues. Given that this market has seen some of the highest levels of growth of any of the world's listed derivatives it would seem to have been a success.

Venues are also starting to cater for multiple asset classes, leading to inter-market fragmentation. For instance, both NYSE and NASDAQ have expanded into equity options. NYSE has also renewed its corporate bond market. Initially, these may just be additional venues competing in the different asset marketplaces. Though, in the future multi-asset strategies may start to bind the various asset classes more closely.

Again, fragmentation does not only apply to execution venues, clearance and settlement procedures must also be considered. In Europe, there is a range of depositorics for equities; hence, the price of a stock is not necessarily the only factor, since each of these depositories levy different charges.

Having praised fragmentation for increasing competition, it is important to note that there are also associated costs. By reducing liquidity at any one venue, it increases the complexity of trading. This is difficult to accurately quantify, but may be significant. Despite this, computerised trading systems have made it easier to cope with fragmented liquidity. Order routing tends to focus on matching the best price. Trading algorithms can offer even more sophisticated approaches: tracking both visible and hidden liquidity across multiple venues and taking advantage of opportunities within a fraction of a second. As trading systems become more sophisticated, the effects of market fragmentation may be noticeably reduced.

#### Repeating cycles

Waves of fragmentation are generally followed by periods of centralisation (or consolidation), as Figure 3-3 tried to show. Note that the periods involved generally span years, or even decades.

The "network effect" means there is a strong centralising force for liquidity to centralise around established market centres. New market entrants must offer significant innovation, or cost incentives, to attract liquidity away from these centres. Such competition often fragments the marketplace. Nevertheless, the more successful centres will continue to grow, consolidating their position by acquiring or merging with other venues. Thus, centralisation starts to take hold again, until the next cycle.

The U.S. equities market is probably the best example of these waves of centralisation and fragmentation. Clear marker periods for centralisation are the founding of the major exchanges, NYSE in 1792 with the "Buttonwood agreement" and NASDAQ in 1973. Whilst fragmentation may be linked to the 1997 quote ruling which led over a dozen ECNs, all vying for market share. By the millennium, the market for U.S. equities was clearly fragmented. Following this, a series of mergers and consolidations occurred, swinging back towards centralisation. Many of the acquisitions were by the major exchanges, helping to consolidate their market share. Suddenly, only a handful of independent ECNs remained. Also, two of the main remaining ECNs, BATS and Direct Edge, have either become exchanges in their own right or are in the process of doing so.

Another wave of new market entrants arrived in the U.S. stock market since the millennium, namely the "dark pool" ATSs. There are now around 40 venues where shares may be traded. Clearly, the ATSs have made the situation more complex, and have increased fragmentation. On the other hand, they are playing a key role in making additional liquidity accessible. Orders which might previously been traded in the "upstairs" market are now available on these ATSs, giving other participants the opportunity to trade in size. The cycle is also showing some signs of starting again, as mergers and consolidations have begun between some of the ATSs and other venues.

It is likely that we shall see these cycles repeated in the other major asset classes. For instance, the millennium saw a flood of electronic bond trading platforms in the U.S. fixed income market. In fact, over 80 were created, but a wave of consolidation has left only a handful. So we might say that this portion of the market is more centralised than it was. Nevertheless, this is still a fragmented marketplace since a considerable amount of bond trading is carried out OTC.

Note that there are no guarantees that the cycle of consolidation and fragmentation will always maintain a steady equilibrium. Over the last few years, demutualization has changed the dynamics between broker/dealers and exchanges. Many broker/dealers have bought shares in regional exchanges, ECNs and ATSs. They have even started directly competing with the exchanges, as opposed to merely pressing for fee reductions. By launching their own ATS platforms, they can handle their own internalised order flow. This also saves them from paying fees to the exchanges/ECNs and allows them to offer price improvement to their elients whilst still capturing part of the bid offer spread. The profitability of such operations means they are less likely to consolidate or disappear. Meanwhile, many exchanges have shifted from mutual organisations to becoming public companies. Suddenly, exchanges are now competing with their historical owners, as Larry Harris points out in an article for Securities Industry News (SIN) (2006a). If they do not get the balance right, liquidity will shift to alternate venues. This could become a real issue since the primary exchanges still provide much of the price discovery for these markets.

#### $3.5$ Global market comparison

So far, we have covered the various asset classes and seen how they are traded. It is also important to try to view these markets in context. One way of doing this is to compare them in terms of their overall size or value. Average daily turnovers also give an idea of their relative significance. Finally, we will look at some estimates for their levels of adoption of electronic and algorithmic trading.

# Overall size

The global outstanding debt is split between equity, fixed income debt, commercial bank assets (deposits/loans) and derivatives. In 2006, the global outstanding debt was around \$208 trillion, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).

Figure 3-7 shows the breakdown of debt for these four asset classes over the last few years. The market capitalisation of the world's public companies accounts for 26% of this total, whilst another 32% is from bonds issued by corporations, governments and their agencies. However, the majority, 36%, of the debt is actually provided by commercial banks.

Derivatives are based on separate underlying assets, so their actual contribution is slightly more complex to measure. Multiple derivative contracts may cover the same underlying physical asset. Therefore, notional amounts for derivatives are not comparable to other asset classes. Based on figures from the 2007 triennial BIS (2007c) OTC derivatives survey, the total notional amount outstanding for all derivatives is actually \$613 trillion.

Figure 3-7 Global market values

In order to quantify the size of debt associated with derivatives an alternative measure is often used, namely their gross market value. This corresponds to the cost of replacing all open derivative contracts, based on current market prices. The SIFMA (2007a) gross market value estimate for all derivatives (exchange traded and OTC) is \$12 trillion; hence, they only contribute to 6% of the debt shown in Figure 3-7.

# Average daily turnover

In general, equities are traded much more frequently than bonds; similarly, listed (exchange traded) derivatives have much higher turnovers than OTC contracts. Although this does not take into account the actual value of each trade. For example, the average value for equity trades is generally much lower than for bonds.

Figure 3-8 shows estimates of the average daily turnovers, in billions of U.S. dollars, for each of the major asset classes. Clearly, exchange traded (ET) derivatives dominate the world markets, in terms of turnover. Similarly, although levels of fixed income trading may be lower than for equities, the actual value traded is an order of magnitude greater. Also note the foreign exchange market, which as a cash-flow based market does not appear as a separate category in Figure 3-7.

Another way of viewing this data is to break it down by region, as shown in Figure 3-9. The equity, fixed income and exchange traded derivatives markets all follow a similar trend. Most of the volume occurs in the Americas, primarily the U.S., whilst the level of trading in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) region is nearly half as much, and in turn trading in Asia is around half the EMEA levels. The two notable exceptions to this trend are foreign exchange and OTC derivatives where Europe has by far the highest trading volumes.

## Adoption of electronic and algorithmic trading

Electronic trading is now commonplace for most asset classes, in particular for more standardised assets. Figure 3-10 shows estimates from the Aite Group (2008) consultancy for the levels of adoption in the major asset classes.

![](_page_24_Figure_3.jpeg)

Figure 3-10 Estimates for the adoption of electronic trading in the major asset classes

The equities markets still lead foreign exchange and fixed income by a substantial margin, with around 80% adoption. If the current increases continue we might expect foreign exchange to reach this level by around 2009-10. Fixed income might be a few years behind this. Though, it is harder to see a wholesale shift occurring in some of the OTC markets.

The growth of electronic trading for futures, options and FX has been even more rapid than that seen in the equity markets. This is possibly due to reuse of existing technology and a faster learning curve, benefiting from past experience. Market conditions are also a vital factor. In fact, the proportion of electronic trading dipped slightly in many markets in 2008 due to the massive volatility from the financial crisis. Though, in the mid to long term the levels of adoption of electronic trading should stay pretty much on course.

The world's markets will continue to evolve in order to adapt to the changes which electronic trading brings. Algorithmic trading is increasingly being used by market participants in order to cope with these changes. Figure 3-11 plots the Aite Group (2008) estimates for the uptake of algorithmic trading, primarily for the U.S. Again, algorithmic trading has its strongest hold over the equities market, closely followed by listed futures, whilst fixed income lags behind. Still, by 2010, algorithmic trading could well be handling considerable trading volumes in all the major asset classes.

Overall, the equities market is still some way ahead of any of the other markets, in terms of levels of electronic and algorithmic trading. Although if we look back to Figure 3-8, the huge turnovers for FX and exchange traded derivatives highlight the importance of the progress being made in these markets. The OTC derivative market also represents a sizeable opportunity, although the bespoke nature of many of the contracts means this is by far the most complex market to tackle. Therefore, it is likely that for the foresceable future progress will continue to be focussed on exchange traded derivatives and FX, whilst consolidating the efforts made in equities and fixed income.

Figure 3-11 Estimates for the adoption of algorithmic trading in the major asset classes

Similarly, looking back at Figure 3-9 we can see that, in terms of capturing turnover for the U.S., by far the biggest opportunity for electronic and algorithmic trading is exchangetraded derivatives, followed by fixed income. Whilst for Europe and Asia the most major markets are FX and exchange traded derivatives.

Future investment in electronic and algorithmic trading will probably continue to differ across both asset classes and regions. This will depend on a mix of factors, namely market conditions, demand from institutions and investors, and the relative sizes of each market.

#### 3.6 Summary

- a A basic grounding in the world markets is important as investors, traders and platforms increasingly have to cope with globalisation and a range of different asset classes.
- There are still huge differences between many of the world's markets, but an increased focus on costs (by both the buy- and sell-sides) and the pace of technological change mean that many of them are exhibiting similar trends, albeit at different rates:
  - Electronic trading is widespread, for many markets it is now the norm.
  - Transparency is increasing, both for pre- and post-trade information.
  - Crossing for block orders is shifting to electronic "dark pool" ATSs.
  - Accessibility is improving for the buy-side.
  - Central counterparties for clearing and settlement are becoming more widespread.
- Counter to these trends is a seemingly endless cycle of centralisation and fragmentation.  $\blacksquare$ 
  - Centralisation occurs because it is easier for established venues to retain liquidity.
  - Fragmentation due to competition from new market entrants helps prevent monopolies. This adds complexity to trading decisions, although as trading systems become more sophisticated such problems may be significantly reduced.

- Electronic trading is leading to irrevocable changes in the global markets, in particular: Increased speed of trading -
  - Massive growth in trading volume -
  - Long-term decrease in order sizes \_
- Algorithmic trading is being used more and more by market participants in order to cope ٠ with today's markets. Equities are still at the forefront, but by 2010, it could well be handling considerable trading volumes in all the major asset classes.
- Based on their daily turnovers, the FX and exchange-traded derivatives markets stand out as important opportunities for algorithmic trading and DMA. Levels of electronic trading are also gradually increasing for fixed income and the money markets. The OTC derivative market also represents a sizeable opportunity, although this is by far the most complex market to tackle.
