# Appendix A **Equity markets**

The world's equity capital markets account for a quarter of the global financial market value, as we saw back in Chapter 3. Historically, stock markets have developed around strong interdealer networks, usually centred on major exchanges. In part, this is due to the highly standardised nature of stocks. Trading on these exchanges is still mainly carried out by brokers. They act as intermediaries, acting as an agency through which to trade orders on the exchanges; broker/dcalers may also be prepared to deal in principal with OTC trades. The equity markets have proven to be ideally suited for implementing electronic and algorithmic trading. Hence, the levels of adoption of these techniques are still significantly higher for the equities markets than any other asset class.

# **Asset specific**

The equity in a corporation represents the value of the remaining assets once all the liabilities have been deducted. A share in a company (also known as stock) represents a portion of this total equity. A finite number of shares are issued by public corporations. Though, they may periodically choose to issue new shares or buy back some of the outstanding ones. If the company performs well its value (and so its share price) should increase. However, if it fails and falls into bankruptcy, shareholders rights are subordinate to those of creditors, so they are typically left with little or nothing. Therefore, shares are forward looking investments; investors expect the value of their shares to increase in order to compensate them for the risk of default. Alternatively, periodic dividend payments may also be made by the company to reimburse investors.

Growing companies tend to need cash so they will often rely on share price rises to appease investors. Whereas more established companies may prefer to issue larger dividends. This flexibility explains part of the appeal of issuing shares for companies.

The kind of equity issued by a company may differ in terms of voting rights and in the distribution of dividends and assets, in case of bankruptcy. The two main types are common stock and preferred stock. Common stock allows the holder to vote in certain corporate decisions, such as the election of directors, issuance of new shares and approving takeovers. Preferred stock has priority over common stock when dividends are issued and in liquidation; however, they tend to have less voting rights.

The total value of the outstanding shares is referred to as the corporation's market capitalisation, or market cap. In U.S. terms, a large-cap, or blue-chip, stock has a value of greater than \$10 billion. Mid-caps have values between \$1 and \$10 billion, small-caps are below \$1 billion and micro-caps have values less than \$100 million. The values for these categories will vary for other countries, but the relative sizes will be similar.

## Pricing and trading

Determining the fair value for equities is non-trivial. Present value theory states that the value of an asset is the discounted sum of its future payments. For stocks, these correspond to their future dividend payments, which in turn depend on future earnings. Though, dividend payments can be difficult to predict. Firms may also choose to reinvest some of their income rather than increasing dividend payouts. A range of estimation models try to take such factors into account. Alternatively, cross-sectional regression analysis may be used to infer prices by comparing key ratios such as  $Price/Earnings (P/E)$  with similar firms, or across whole sectors/industries.

Investors also have varying information about each company and so their valuations will be dissimilar. Thus, market prices reflect the average of all these valuations combined with the effects of supply and demand. Consequently, the market capitalisation will often be different to the fundamental value of a corporation's (its assets minus its liabilities).

In terms of trading, stocks are readily transferable in a domestic context, so markets like the U.S. have seen a huge amount of local competition, between both exchanges and other execution venues. Electronic access and remote memberships, for foreign investors/traders, are helping to increase access to venues. There is also a buoyant depositary receipt market for trading foreign stocks. Essentially, these are just proxies allowing foreign stocks to be traded locally (they are covered in more detail in Appendix F). Together, all these factors mean that stocks are starting to become truly global assets that may be traded 24 hours a day. For instance, Mark Howarth (2004) uses Sony as an example to demonstrate how such trading is now possible for many major firms. Table A-1 shows some of the potential trading venues for this throughout the day.

| Time<br>(Japan Standard Time) | Trading venue             |  |  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------|--|--|
| $08:00 - 09:00$               | Tokyo pre-trade           |  |  |
| $09:00 - 15:00$               | Tokyo                     |  |  |
| $15:00 - 24:00$               | London, GDR IOB           |  |  |
| $18:00 - 24:00$               | Tokyo after-hours markets |  |  |
| $22:30 - 05:00$               | U.S. ADR                  |  |  |
| $05:00 - 08:00$               | U.S. after-hours markets  |  |  |

Table A-1 Potential trading venues for a Japanese stock

Once the Tokyo stock exchange has closed, trading may continue either on its after-hours platform (ToSTNeT) or on other local after-hours markets, such as SBI JapanNext. Trading can also shift to London stock exchange's International Order Book (IOB). Similarly, before London closes the U.S. opens, allowing depositary receipts to be traded here and on after market venues until Tokyo opens again.

# World equity markets

The world's equity markets continue to be centred on stock exchanges. However, an increasing array of new execution venues such as Electronic Communications Networks (ECNs) and Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) have brought both competition and fragmentation. That said, the high level of electronic trading and access via DMA and algorithmic trading mean that the world's equity markets have arguably the highest level of client-side accessibility.

Table A-2 shows the world's top fifteen stock exchanges in terms of their domestic market capitalisation and total value of share trading for 2007 and 2008, based on data from the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) (2009). Clearly, the U.S. dominates the world's equity trading with both the NYSE and the NASDAQ exchanges. The Tokyo, Euronext and London stock exchanges also have significant market shares and turnovers.

#### Table A-2 Major world stock markets

Although some global execution is possible, stock markets are generally focussed on domestic trading. In part, this is due to the much higher level of regulation for the stock markets. Still, over the last few years exchanges have started to become truly global entities. The mergers between NYSE and Euronext, NASDAQ and OMX are a good example of this. Hence, global competition is likely to increase significantly in the coming years.

Electronic trading has become ubiquitous for the world's stock markets, particularly for the sell-side. Buy-side levels of adoption of DMA and algorithmic trading are also high, especially in the U.S. Figure A-1 shows both the current levels of adoption of algorithmic trading and projections for 2010, based on estimates from the Aite Group (2007a) consultancy. Clearly, it will still take some time before the levels of adoption for algorithmic trading in Europe and Asia reach those of the U.S.

# American equity markets

North America obviously dominates the region with some of the world's largest exchanges, as shown in Table A-2. The markets in Canada and Latin American are much smaller.

# **U.S. equity market**

The U.S. equity market is led by two of the largest stock markets in the world, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the NASDAQ (originally an acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations). Figure A-2 shows an estimate for the breakdown of the market-share in December 2008.

# Figure A-2 U.S. equity market share in 2008 (December)

Although they still lead the U.S. marketplace, both NYSE and NASDAQ have had to constantly evolve in order to maintain their position. They have also kept an eye on the global marketplace: As evidenced by NYSE's merger with Euronext and NASDAQ's acquisition of OMX. The rest of the U.S. market is split between BATS and Direct Edge, the regional exchanges, brokers, and around 40 distinct electronic communication networks

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>1</sup> Statistics compiled by Financial Information Forum with data from BATS Trading.

(ECNs) and alternative trading systems (ATSs). The intense competition has made the U.S. a very fluid marketplace. In fact, the two leading competitors, BATS and Direct Edge, have evolved from ECNs into full exchanges (or are in the process of doing so). Hence, the market-share breakdown for 2009/10 may be noticeably different from Figure A-2.

The U.S. equities market leads the world for the level of adoption of DMA and algorithmic trading. Uptake has been greatest on the sell-side where traders have relied on remote electronic access for many years. Trading algorithms are often used by traders as an efficiency tool, although buy-side usage has also increased. In their 2007 U.S. Equity Investors Study, Greenwich Associates (2007) found that three-quarters of investment managers and mutual funds used algorithmic trading strategies, whilst for hedge funds the figure was more than 85%.

A TABB Group (2008) survey of U.S. institutional trading found that 55% of U.S. equity trades were executed via DMA (9%), algorithms (24%), crossing networks (11%) or program trading (11%) in 2008. Note that in 2007 this total was actually 63%. The 2007-09 financial crisis and ensuing market volatility led to increased levels of high touch trading. However, the proportion of algorithmic trading has continued to grow, up from  $22\%$  in 2007. Other surveys put the level of DMA even higher. For example, the Celent (2008b) consultancy estimates that DMA accounts for around 15-18% of the share volume, predicting this to increase to 20% by 2010. Similarly, an earlier report by the Aite Group (2007a) consultancy put the level of DMA at around 19%, whilst they estimated that algorithmic trading had reached 18%.

Regulation has played a significant part in shaping the U.S. equity marketplace; it has generally been used to try to increase competitiveness, or correct practices that are perceived as being anti-competitive. Table A-3 outlines some of the key regulatory milestones and their effects.

| Year | Regulation                   | Direct effects   |
|------|------------------------------|------------------|
| 1963 | Restructuring OTC trading    | NASDAQ created   |
| 1975 | National Market System (NMS) | 1TS created      |
| 1997 | NASDAQ order handling rules  | ECNs             |
| 2001 | Decimalisation               | Reduced spreads  |
| 2007 | Regulation NMS               | More competition |

# Table A-3 Milestones in U.S. equity market regulation

Starting in 1963, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recommended restructuring over the counter (OTC) trading, leading to the creation of NASDAQ. Whilst the National Market System (NMS) was introduced to consolidate price and trade information amongst the various exchanges, as well as provide an inter-market system (ITS) to route orders between them. Then in 1997, NASDAQ order handling rules were introduced to offer investors more protection for their limit orders, and to ensure that dealers always displayed their best quotes. The ruling to display client limit orders (when priced better than the dealer's quote) helped push NASDAQ away from being a purely quote-driven market to incorporating behaviour more like a limit order book. Notably, though, it was the quote ruling which had the most impact. Previously, dealers had been able to use private interdealer systems to trade at better prices; the new ruling meant that these prices should also be available to the public. In effect, this opened a window on NASDAQ for external execution venues, and suddenly many new ECNs were created, all competing for market share.

Decimalisation was introduced in 2001, leading to lower bid offer spreads. The resultant 0.1 cent tick size also encouraged the practice of "pennying" (jumping ahead of an existing order simply by upping the price by a penny). Decimalisation has helped continue the trend of smaller order sizes and so has encouraged traders with large orders to use alternative venues, in particular the newer ATSs or so-called "dark pools". Last, but not least, Regulation NMS was implemented in 2007, providing rules for:

- Fair access
- Order protection  $\bullet$
- Abolishing sub-penny pricing  $\bullet$
- Market data revenue allocation .

In part, these rekindle the earlier 1975 regulations, although they meant scrapping the ITS. Instead, the fair access rule mandates that private links must be established to allow venues to route orders between each other. In addition, venues capturing a significant proportion of the ADV must provide a market quote. The order protection (or "trade-through") rule requires that trades must be executed at the best displayed price accessible in under a second. So an order placed on the NYSE will actually be routed and executed wherever the best quoted price is, be it NASDAQ or an ECN. In comparison, the ITS allowed a 30 second time window for an order to be acted on, whilst this may have seemed reasonable 30 years ago, in a market where trading is now often measured in milliseconds this delay is a lifetime. In fact, this huge delay put the ITS order creator at a considerable disadvantage to the market, as Larry Tabb points out in an article for the TABB Group (2003). Regulation NMS should help increase market competition, but its long-term impact remains to be seen.

The 2007-09 financial crisis also triggered a fresh look at many aspects of the U.S. marketplace by regulators. Initially, the focus was on short selling, but has since expanded to look at the "dark pool" ATSs and the use of IOIs, as well as "flash" orders and highfrequency trading. Only time will tell what new regulations result and how they affect the markets.

The U.S. equity marketplace has arguably seen more changes than any of the world's markets. As we saw in Figure A-2, the major exchanges still lead the market share; however, they are facing stiff competition. Since stocks are so fungible, trading in them can happen at virtually any of these venues, regardless of where they are actually listed.

Figure A-3 An alternate view of the U.S. equity market

The NYSE is by far the world's largest stock exchange. Historically, trading has been based around specialists, <sup>4</sup> who are responsible for maintaining a "fair and orderly" market for each stock. Early on, the NYSE was one of the first exchanges to offer electronic order routing; namely via the 1976 Designated Order Turnaround (DOT) system. This was followed by SuperDOT in 1984, which went on to handle more than 75% of the order flow, even though such routing meant the specialist was still required to manually match orders (which could be up to 100,000 in size). Though, the NYSE has been slower than some exchanges in the shift to fully electronic trading, in part due to the success of its trading floor and specialists. Fully automated execution was first offered in 2000 for small orders (up to 1,099 shares) by NYSE Direct+. The next major step forward was the introduction of the NYSE Hybrid market in 2005. This offers the automated execution of Direct+, but for orders of up to a million shares; it also removes the time restrictions and is fully integrated with OpenBook to allow off-market participants a much more detailed view of the available market depth. By Q2 2007, electronic trading accounted for over 90% of NYSE trading with over 80% of the total share volume, as noted on NYSE Exchanges (2007). NYSE Hybrid has significantly reduced average execution times. A review in Trading Talk by Rosenblatt Securities (2007) notes that it also helped to reduce quoted spreads, although volatility was found to increase slightly. Structural changes have also been made. In 2008, the NYSE changed the role of specialist to become designated market makers (DMMs). DMMs are able to trade at parity, rather than having to give priority to client orders, encouraging them to provide additional liquidity, as outlined by Ivy Schmerken (2008). In addition, supplemental liquidity providers (SLP) are also able to make markets in NYSE stocks. Such innovation, both in terms of market structure and technology, is vital for NYSE to maintain its position.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>4</sup> Peter Bennett (2005) retells the accidental story of how specialists first came about. Legend has it that a leading broker, James Boyd, broke his leg in 1875. Unable to walk between trading posts, he did all his business from a chair at the Western Union post. Other brokers then started to have him work their Western Union orders for commission, leaving them free to run between the other trading posts.

Increased competition has meant that over time NYSE's market share has noticeably decreased. In 2005, it was over 80%; however, since then it has dipped below 50%, the estimate for December 2008 is shown in Table A-4. Incorporating the Area exchange in

also seem to have helped. NASDAQ was originally created in 1971 as a bulletin board, allowing OTC trading of stocks, but it soon became a multi-dealer quote-driven market. Like the NYSE, the systems behind NASDAQ have been extensively updated over the last few years. Fully electronic trading was first provided in 1984 by the Small Order Execution System (SOES). Then in 1988 the release of SelectNet allowed dealers to negotiate electronically. These were later merged to form SuperSOES. The next major step was the release of Super Montage in 2002, which displayed market depth (the three best buy and sell orders), fully supported limit orders and allowed anonymous trading by using the SIZE moniker. Continuing its transformation, electronic call auctions were introduced for both the opening and closing in 2004. In terms of market share, NASDAQ has also faced a lot of competition, indeed in 2005 ECNs had a combined market share greater than 60%, leaving NASDAO with less than a third of the market. Though, NASDAQ has managed to regain its position, notably by buying two of its largest competitors, namely Brut in 2004 and INET in 2005. These additional order books were fully integrated with SuperMontage in Single-Book in 2007. NASDAQ has also managed to capture an increasing proportion of trading in NYSE listed stocks, whilst its new listing segment (Global Select Markets) should help bolster its own listings.

2006 helped in consolidating its position. The market structure and trading platform changes

BATS Trading started life as an ECN in 2006, although in 2008 it became an exchange in its own right. Initially, NASDAQ market share was targeted with aggressive pricing schemes. For instance, in January 2007 more was awarded in rebates than fees, growing its NASDAQ share to 14%, although this dropped slightly afterwards. BATS has also managed to significantly increase its proportion of NYSE volume. By August 2008, average daily volumes were around 750 million shares; about half of what traded on NYSE Arca, making it the third most important venue in the U.S. Volume has steadily continued to increase since then.

Direct Edge is another venue that started out as an ECN. The International Securities Exchange (ISE) stock exchange is now a wholly owned subsidiary. Direct Edge is continuing plans to become an exchange in its own right. Interestingly, it provides two execution platforms, EDGA and EDGX. EDGA charges the same fee for adding or removing liquidity, it is intended for more pro-active traders. EDGX follows a maker/taker fee schedule, so liquidity providers receive a rebate.

The regional exchanges, namely the American (AMEX), Boston, Chicago (Midwest) and National (Cincinnati) stock exchanges have managed to maintain some presence in both NYSE and NASDAQ stocks, as well as smaller listed companies. Many of them have also embraced the options markets. However, market consolidation and competition has had a massive effect on them. The Pacific exchange was taken over by Archipelago before being incorporated into the NYSE. Likewise, AMEX has also been bought and is now called NYSE Alternext; its focus is on listing smaller firms and options. The Boston Equities exchange closed its doors back in 2007; it has since become NASDAQ OMX BX. This has pricing designed to attract liquidity takers, giving NASDAQ a dual structure like Direct Edge. Clearly, such consolidation makes the outlook for the remaining regional exchanges less certain. Despite their relatively small market share, they can still be attractive propositions as independent entities since they offer the chance to recoup revenue from market data and exchange fees, as noted by Joshua Galper (2006).

As we have already seen, ECNs have had a huge impact on the exchanges, particularly NASDAQ. By the millennium there were over a dozen ECNs, all vying for market share; although the market was dominated by Island, Instinct and Archipelago. Since then, the competition has increased, but there has been a large amount of consolidation. In fact, of the original four ECNs founded after the 1997 SEC order handling rules, only Bloomberg Tradebook remains. The Area ECN merged with REDIBook in 2002, forming the Archipelago Exchange; it then went on to merge with the Pacific Exchange before being bought by NYSE in 2006. Similarly, Island merged with Instinct in 2002 to form the INET ECN, which was bought by NASDAQ in 2006, two years after its purchase of the Brut ECN. Meanwhile BATS has now become an exchange and Direct Edge is in the process of becoming one. Soon, independent ECNs may be something of a rarity.

In the last few years, ATSs (or the so-called "dark pools" or "dark books") have become more prominent. Their number is growing just as rapidly; currently there are around 40 venues, double that of early 2006. This is understandable when average execution sizes of up to  $40-50,000$  shares may be accomplished on some of them, in comparison to less than 500 on NYSE or NASDAQ. Rosenblatt Securities provide a regular report detailing the volume traded on "dark pool" venues. Table A-5 shows their adjusted average daily crossing volumes (for April 2009) for some of the kcy venues, together with the corresponding market share. The adjustments try to take account of the double counting which can occur when orders are matched across multiple venues.

#### Table A-5 Non-displayed U.S. liquidity pool volumes

A detailed review of many of the main ATS venues is provided in an article from Rosenblatt Securities (2007a). To categorise them we will use the same types as in Chapter

2, so the crossings are scheduled or continuous, and are negotiated, advertised, blind or internal.

Scheduled crossings have been provided since 1987 by ITG's POSIT. Currently, this offers a dozen separate intraday crosses together with two after the close. Effectively, each cross is an anonymous call auction, priced at the midpoint of the national best bid and offer (NBBO). Instinct offer a similar service, with 7 intraday crosses (IDX) and an after the close (LDX); in addition there are two morning crosses which use a VWAP price (VWAPX).

Continuous crossing systems have grabbed a significant proportion of the market share. A notable example is Liquidnet, a buy-side oriented system launched in 2001 that offers a negotiation-based crossing mechanism. Liquidnet constantly tries to find matches between its clients' buy and sell order requirements, when it finds them notifications are sent to each party. They are then free to enter into anonymous bilateral negotiations for both the size and price. Although the negotiation is anonymous, Liquidnet employs a scorecard (like eBay's ratings) to reflect each user's history of successful crossings. This approach has proven extremely popular with the buy-side, in part because of the added sense of security that no sell-side or proprietary traders have access.

Continuous blind crossing systems have also become increasingly popular. In 2001, the Millcnnium ATS<sup>5</sup> was launched by NYFIX, offering "pass through" orders. ITG released POSIT Now in 2002, providing a continuous version of their popular crossing mechanism. LeveL is another noteworthy venue, which has seen rapid growth since its launch in 2006 by a consortium of Boston Stock Exchange (BSE) investors. For many of these blind crossing networks, "pass through" orders have become a notable source of liquidity. As their name suggests, these orders first try to match with the liquidity available within the ATS, before then being routed on to their intended destination, whether that is a primary/regional exchange, ECN or possibly even another ATS. Similar approaches are offered by Instinet's Continuous Block Crossing (CBX) and Liquidnet's  $H_2O$  network. Liquidnet  $H_2O$  allows smart order routers to send sell-side flow to Liquidnet to cross with buy side orders. The fact that the interaction is only at the smart order router level, ensuring no human intervention, minimises information leakage for the buy side.

Advertised crossing is another important mechanism, for which Pipeline is probably the best-known example. It maintains a block-board of stocks, which are highlighted in orange when liquidity is present. Block price ranges are available as a guideline, although no sizes are displayed. Users may then place firm orders to execute with the available liquidity. Pipeline enforces strict minimum share thresholds to prevent predatory trading. The Millennium ATS also provides its clients with an optional Plus order type, which sends liquidity alerts to a group of passive liquidity partners (PLPs) once the order reaches Millennium. These PLPs are other dark pools or internal crossing engines that allow for automated responses without any human intervention. Again, this ensures that the alerts are not visible to traders whilst maximising their chance to be filled. In 2005, ITG released POSIT Alert,<sup>6</sup> based on indications it alerts users when liquidity is available, leaving them to decide whether to execute. Buy-side firms may also choose to only notify other buy-side users.

Constant market evolution means hybrids of the above crossing types are also being developed. For instance, in 2006 a consortium of broker/dcalers announced the Block Interest Discovery Service (BIDS) for both the buy and sell side. This uses firm and

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>5</sup> BNY ConvergEx announced they have agreed to acquire Millennium in 2009.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>6</sup> POSIT Alert was previously known as BlockAlert (when it was a joint venture with Merrill Lynch).

conditional orders to support both continuous blind crossing as well as negotiated crossing using scorecards. BNY ConvergEx's VortEx combines "actionable" Indications of Interest (IOIs) from a large network of external liquidity providers with its continuous blind crossing platform to securely provide additional liquidity. Other innovations are Instinet's CBX, which allows users to fully configure what information (price, size) they may wish to share with other participants. The LeveL ATS can even incorporate client preferences for specific counterparties in its matching logic.

Brokers' own crossing networks have rapidly become a major force in terms of "dark pool" liquidity, as shown by their respective market shares in Table A-5. Originally, these were just internal crossing networks that allowed them to save the fees from executing on exchanges or other venues. Still, over the last few years these have progressively opened up for direct client access, effectively transforming them into ATSs in their own right. The volumes passing through the brokers mean that these are now major competitors in this space. Prominent amongst these are Credit Suisse's CrossFinder, Goldman Sachs' Sigma X and UBS's Price Improvement Network (PIN). In 2008, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Morgan Stanley also made agreements that will allow their clients access to liquidity from each other's networks.

"Dark pools" linked to market making operations have become another important source of liquidity. For example, GETCO Execution Services is an ATS that provides execution via IOC orders, with liquidity sourced from the GETCO market makers.

Unsurprisingly, exchanges and ECNs have also been keen to enter this arena, as they attempt to retain and attract liquidity from the ATSs. In 2006, the International Securities Exchange (ISE) created MidPoint Match, a blind crossing venue that supports pass-through flow to its electronic market. It also allows orders to advertise via firm Solicitations of Interest (SOIs). The Direct Edge ECN allows orders to be routed to a range of ATSs including Liquidnet  $H_2O$ . Similarly, in 2007 NASDAO launched its own crossing network with an aggressive pricing scheme, whilst 2008 saw NYSE launch Matchpoint, its own anonymous crossing service. In 2009, the New York Block Exchange (NYBX) was launched; this is a joint venture between NYSE Euronext and BIDS Holdings. Unlike many of the other ATSs, NYBX has full access to the NYSE order book, including its nondisplayed liquidity. Other financial institutions are also creating their own internal crossing systems, such as Fidelity's CrossStream.

Despite all these changes and the acute competition, it is still widely expected that further cycles of fragmentation and consolidation will occur. As usual, liquidity and order flow will be the keys to survival.

#### Canadian equity market

The Canadian market is still dominated by the primary exchange, the six main banks, and their brokerage arms. A nice overview of the market is provided by Alison Crosthwait (2009) from ITG Canada Corp. In 2006, new regulations were passed to ensure hest execution, as well as allowing the establishment of alternative trading systems. Effectively kick-starting the same processes we have seen in the U.S. Prior to this, around a third of all trading was still carried out off-exchange in the upstairs market. In fact, Crosthwait (2009) estimates this had fallen to around 16% in 2008.

Historically, much of the competition for trading Canadian stocks has been from the U.S. In fact, around 200 of the 1,500 Canadian companies are cross-listed on U.S. exchanges. For these, the U.S. accounts for a considerable amount of trading, although the majority still takes place on the primary exchange. ITG Inc. even offers a Best Market Server smart router

that adjusts for  $FX$  and so can trade such stocks by automatically routing orders between the U.S. and Canada.

Local competition arrived in 2003, in the form of the Canadian National Stock Exchange (CNSX) (formerly the Canadian Trading and Quotation System, Inc.) which offers an alternate site for listing emerging companies. This is a fully electronic trading platform, now based on the X-stream trading engine from NASDAQ OMX.

ECN-like venues have also been established, such as Pure Trading. This was launched in early 2008 with maker/taker based pricing. Like the CNSX, it is also based on the X-stream engine. The Alpha ATS is another new electronic order book based venue; launched in November 2008 by nine major Canadian brokers, based on Cinnober's TRADExpress ATS platform. Alternatively, a fully anonymous order book is provided by the Omega ATS, which was launched in 2007.

The major players from the U.S. have also started tailoring their platforms for Canada. For example, Instinet has launched a Canadian version of Chi-X, based on the same software as used in its European crossing market. Bloomberg Tradebook has also established itself.

Several "dark pool" execution venues have already been established in Canada. Liquidnet offers their continuous negotiation driven crossing platform. Likewise, ITG's Match Now ATS provides a virtually continuous blind auction (every 30s) which also incorporates streaming liquidity to other venues. Perimeter Financial's BlockBook also offered a dark pool ATS, but it has been reported that it is shutting down due to lack of business.

## Other American equity markets

The Latin American markets are much smaller than those in the U.S. Although its largest market Brazil is one of the top twenty in the world, in terms of capitalisation and trading volume. For comparison, Table A-6 shows most of the American exchanges.

### **Table A-6 Other American stock markets**

The Bolsa de Valores de São Paulo (BOVESPA) is both Brazil's and the region's largest stock exchange. It is a completely electronic market; the trading floor was closed in 2005. In 2008, it merged with the Brazilian derivatives exchange (Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros). BOVESPA's trading platform MegaBolsa provides a fully transparent order book, based on the Nouveau Système de Cotation (NSC) platform. Market makers provide additional 486

liquidity for stocks. Brokers offer DMA and have also started providing algorithmic trading.

Mexico's Bolsa Mexicana de Valores (BMV) is the region's second largest exchange. This has been fully electronic since 1999, based on its BMV-SENTRA Captiales central limit order book. Brokers also offer DMA and algorithmic trading is becoming available.

However, around as much volume for Brazil and Mexican companies is traded via depositary receipts as is traded on exchange. These are proxies, allowing stocks to be traded as if they were domestic shares in the U.S. or Europe. For instance, in 2008, \$750 billion traded on BM&FBOVESPA and \$112 billion traded on the BMV, based on data from the WFE (2009). In comparison, \$899 worth of Brazilian and \$191 billion worth of Mexican depositary receipts were traded, according to the Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) (2008). Therefore, the key competitor for the Latin American stocks is actually the depositary receipt market, which we shall cover in more detail in Appendix F.

# **EMEA** equity markets

Europe is elearly the largest market in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. The European equity market is second in size only to the U.S. Indeed, four of the top ten stock exchanges (by 2008 market cap) are European. The European Union has helped unify the marketplace, particularly with the creation of the single currency in 1999. There has also been some consolidation amongst the exchanges, notably the creation of Euronext. Still, Europe consists of thirty states so there is a diverse range of currencies, regulations and trading mechanisms.

Just as in the U.S., regulation is likely to be a major factor in shaping the future of the European marketplace. In November 2007, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) took effect. This aims to encourage competition between trading venues, improve pre and post-trade transparency and enforce "best execution" requirements. Previously, concentration rules in countries such as France, Spain and Italy prevented significant offexchange trading. For broker/dealers the compulsory post-trade reporting means their OTC trades must be reported. Firms that provide off exchange trading venues may be classified as Systematic Internalisers (SIs) and so become subject to regulations much like the exchanges. For example, SIs must publish firm quotes during market hours, report all trades and may not offer price improvement on orders below a specific market size. Alternatively, rather than managing this by themselves there is always the option to join one of the Multilateral Trading Facilities (MTFs), such as Turquoisc. In the short to medium term, MiFID has resulted in a spate of new execution venues competing for liquidity from the exchanges, hut also sourcing new liquidity that previously may have been hidden. A report by the Aite Group (2009) consultancy notes that MTFs should reach 20% market share of European trading in 2009, and could achieve 50% by 2013. Hence, Europe is entering a cycle of fragmentation, which may well be followed by a consolidation phase.

Electronic trading is pretty much universal on the sell-side, with levels of algorithmic trading growing rapidly. Though, buy-side uptake has tended to lag the U.S. A report by the TABB Group (2007b) consultancy notes that in 2007 electronic order routing was used by over 50% of firms, and should grow to 65% by 2009, most of this routing over FIX. In terms of volume, the Celent (2008b) consultancy estimates that DMA accounts for 8% of the flow, projecting this to grow to 15% by 2011. The buy-side adoption of algorithms is also growing; the TABB Group (2007b) reported it at 41%, expecting it to reach 58% by 2009.

Most of the region's venues are based on electronic central limit order books, often using call auctions for the open and close. Many also incorporate dedicated market makers or liquidity providers. The widespread adoption of electronic order books can be traced back to the competition that London's International Order Book spawned in 1986. Each country's primary exchange generally still has a monopoly over its listed stocks. Though, since the implementation of MiFID they are now starting to face stiff competition from a wide range of MTFs. Table A-7 shows the breakdown of market capitalisation and trading volumes for the region's main exchanges.

## **Table A-7 European equity markets**

Euronext was created in 2000 by the merger of the Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam stock exchanges. These were joined in 2002 by Portugal; it has also established membership/ access agreements with the Helsinki and Warsaw stock exchanges. Though, clearly the most notable merger was completed in 2007 with the NYSE. Euronext is based on an electronic order book that allows access for dedicated liquidity providers. Originally, this was the Nouveau Système de Cotation (NSC); however, early in 2009 equity trading migrated to the new Universal Trading Platform (UTP) which offers even greater capacity and lower latency.

On the London Stock Exchange (LSE), the electronic central limit order book for FTSE 100 companies is provided by its Stock Exchange Electronic Trading Service (SETS), which dates back to 1997. Although in 2007, the platform was upgraded with a new transaction engine (TradElect). Around 800 mid and small eap stocks are also catered for by SETS with registered market makers providing liquidity to the order book via displayed quotes. (Note these were formerly handled by the SETSmm hybrid market, whose quote functionality was rolled into SETS as part of the preparations for MiFID.) Less liquid main market stocks are currently handled by SETSqx, which combines a quote based market with four intraday crosses to improve overall liquidity and to help member firms to meet MiFID requirements. The Borsa Italiana has also migrated to the LSE's TradElect platform, as has the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Norway's Oslo Børs is also planning to adopt TradElect; currently their trading is based on the NASDAQ OMX's SAXESS platform.

The Deutsche Börse operates the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Xetra, its electronic platform, offers a hybrid marketplace, based on an electronic order book that allows designated market makers to provide additional liquidity. They have introduced discounts to encourage

algorithmic trading. It is estimated that around 40% of their volume now originates from such systems. Xetra is also used by the Vienna, Irish and Budapest stock exchanges.

The Spanish Bolsas y Mercados Españoles are linked through an electronic system (SIBE), and have seen considerable volume growth over the last few years.

The Stockholm, Copenhagen and Helsinki stock exchanges are part of the NASDAQ OMX Group, as are the Baltic exchanges for Riga, Vilnius and Tallinn. Trading is based on their INET platform (previously the SAXESS platform was used).

For smaller companies, there is a range of dedicated exchanges, most notably London's Alternative Investments Market (AIM). This is operated by the LSE, and is now the world's leading market for small-cap stocks. By 2008, AIM had over 1600 quoted companies including 300 international ones and a combined market cap of over \$170 billion. It uses SETS for its fifty most traded stocks, whilst the quote driven SEAQ is used for the less traded, although ultimately this will probably migrate to SETSqx. Euronext's Alternext market, Spain's Nuevo Mercado and the NASDAQ OMX First North also offer alternative marketplaces, although these are much smaller than AIM. Germany's Neuer Markt has been incorporated back into the main market. In the U.K., the PLUS Markets Group has established some local competition; its exchange has over 180 listings and a total market cap of nearly \$4 billion. It provides trading for around 7,500 U.K. and European small and midcap stocks.

Pan-European execution venues have also been established. In the past, their success has been somewhat mixed; venues such as Chi-X have flourished whilst others such as EASDAQ  $^7$  and Jiway  $^8$  floundered. In part, this has been due to national concentration regulations that favoured many of the primary exchanges. In addition, the rapid adoption of electronic order books by the European exchanges meant that ECNs initially had much less impact in Europe than the U.S. Though, the introduction of MiFID meant that regulations now actively encourage such competition. Hence, MTFs from Turquoise, NASDAQ OMX Europe and BATS were launched in 2008. NYSE Euronext launched its own MTF in 2009, as did Equiduct and Burgundy, other venues are also due.

Instinct's Chi-X MTF has proven that liquidity can be shifted away from the major exchanges. Launched in 2007 it currently offers trading in stocks for most of the major European indices and has managed to attract large sell-side firms to provide liquidity. In terms of market share, it estimated to have captured around 17% of trading for the U.K.'s FTSE 100 stocks, around 13% of France's CAC 40 firms and Amsterdam's AEX stocks and around 9% of Germany's DAX 30, based on the companies own data in November 2008. For its top stocks, it is capturing anything from 30-50% of the daily volume, reporting average price improvements of 4 bps. This rapid success may be attributed to a mix of its pricing structure and its speed. Interestingly, it also offers trading to 3 decimal places for all stocks, and so allows trading between the spreads quoted on the major exchanges. This is something that Regulation NMS removed from ECNs in the U.S. (the Sub-Penny rule).

The Turquoise MTF has been driven primarily by a group of broker/dealers and was launched in September 2008. It provides an electronic order book for most of the major European indices, together with support for fully hidden orders. The platform is based on Cinnober's TRADExpress, which also powers the London Metals Exchange. An article in

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>7</sup> EASDAQ was founded in 1996 to try and emulate the success of NASDAQ, who in turn bought it and created NASDAQ Europe in 2001. However, with only 60 listings it proved vulnerable to the post-millennium tech downturn, closing in 2003.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>8</sup> Jiway was launched in 2000 as a joint venture between the OMX Group and Morgan Stanley, but it failed to source enough liquidity from retail flow and so closed two years later.

The Trade News (2008) notes that in early November it had captured around 7% of trading for stocks in France's CAC and Switzerland's SMI indices, 5% or more for the Dutch AEX, German DAX and UK's FTSE, as well as a smaller portion of trading in Italy's MIB and Sweden's OMX indices. The London Stock Exchange has announced plans to purchase a majority share in Turquoise, so it will be interesting to see what effect this has.

The NASDAQ OMX Europe MTF went live in September 2008. It caters for over 1,200 stocks, covering the major indices for markets in the U.K., Germany, France, Netherlands, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden and Spain. Based on NASDAQ OMX's INET platform it also supports pan-European order routing to the region's other main exchanges and MTFs.

BATS also launched its own MTF in October 2008, aiming to recreate the success of its U.S. operation for European stocks. Trading encompasses stocks from all the major European indices.

Meanwhile, March 2009 saw the introduction of NYSE Area Europe. Based on their UTP platform, it supports trading for the blue-chip European stocks, which are not already handled by its Euronext markets.

Equiduct's MTF also went live in March 2009, supporting trading for the most liquid stocks from the LSE, Euronext and Deutsche Börse. Its HybridBook platform is an electronic order book that also supports trading at proprietary benchmarks, namely the Europe-wide Best Bid and Offer (EBBO), which is based on consolidated prices from the major markets. A Volume weighted Best Bid and Offer (VBBO) is offered as well, although there is a premium for these benchmark trades.

The Burgundy MTF launched in May 2009, backed by major Nordic brokers. This focuses on trading mid-cap and small-cap Nordic stocks and also offers hidden (or "dark") order types. It is based on Cinnober's TRADExpress trading system.

In response to such competition, the European exchanges are already making changes to try to retain their liquidity post MiFID. They are altering their fee structures, adopting a maker/taker approach and offering reductions for trading in volume. London, Xetra and Euronext have all either released, or are in the process of updating their trading systems to support greater volumes and lower their latencies to below 10ms, to compete with the likes of Chi-X. NYSE Euronext has also started reducing the tick sizes of many of its stocks, introducing support for pricing to three decimal places, like Chi-X. The Deutsche Börse has also launched a pan-European trading segment, the Xetra International Market (XIM), to further compete with the MTFs.

In terms of order internalisation, the Deutsche Börse was one of the first exchanges to recognise the importance this, introducing Xetra-BEST in 2002. This allows brokers to internalise their retail orders, gaining MiFID compliance and saving on settlement fees, whilst retail clients benefit from a mandatory price improvement. They have also reduced their fees and cut the mandatory price improvement to €0.001 to encourage more brokers to adopt BEST. Likewise, in early 2007, Euronext announced that it was developing a new trading mechanism to ensure best execution, allowing members to be MiFID complaint without having to become Systematic Internalisers.

The ramp-up in "dark pools" of liquidity has also been slower in Europe, although given that significant amounts trade off-exchange, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, there is plenty of opportunity. A report by the Celent (2007c) consultancy predicts that ATSs will capture around a 5% market share by 2011. In part, this is because the major European exchanges have offered hidden and/or iceberg orders for some time, helping to accommodate block trading. The Deutsche Börse supports intraday blind crossings, every 15 minutes

(except during auctions on the main market) via their XETRA-XXL platform. The LSE also offers a crossing service via SEAQ Crosses, although it is intended primarily for less liquid stocks. Undoubtedly, the other exchanges will also consider providing crossing systems to try to retain their liquidity.

In terms of continuous "dark pools", Xetra MidPoint offers a closed order book with continuous midpoint trading. Likewise, SWX has launched "Swiss Block" in partnership with NYFIX. In 2009, NYSE Euronext launched SmartPool, as a joint project with several major international hanks. SmartPool provides continuous mid-point crossing together with four daily periodic crosses; it also offers routing to the NYSE Euronext central order book. Also in 2009, NASDAQ OMX launched its continuous dark pool, NEURO Dark. Based on INET it offers mid-point crossing from the primary market and caters for over a thousand European stocks (it supports internalised orders as well). In the same year, Chi-X's Chi-Delta and the BATS Europe Dark Pool were launched, providing continuous mid-point crossing. The LSE will also provide a dark pool for the region.

Unsurprisingly, the major U.S. ATSs, namely ITG and Liquidnet, have already established themselves in Europe. For scheduled crossing systems POSIT is arguably the leader, being established here since 1998. It covers over 9,000 stocks across 15 countries with eight matching sessions each day (biased towards the open). ITG acquired its main direct European competition (E-Crossnet) in 2005. Other types of crossing are also available in Europe, the negotiated crossing system Liquidnet went live in Europe in 2002, and offers trading in 22 markets, allowing institutional users to trade liquid stocks in much larger average sizes than those available on the exchanges. It is also considering expanding into the Middle East. ITG has introduced a European version of its POSIT Alert platform as well, complementing its continuous blind crossing system, POSIT Now, which was released in 2007. Likewise, Euro Millennium was launched by NYFIX in 2008; this is a European version of its continuous blind crossing platform, although it is now owned by NYSE Euronext.

Many of the major brokers have also established European internal crossing networks, for example, Credit Suisse's CrossFinder.

In order to cope with all these new venues and to try to reduce the impact of fragmentation, pre- and post-trade information need to be aggregated. Presently, this is handled by the main market data providers. Markit's Boat (formerly "Project Boat") also provides a single interface for pan-European trade reporting. The UK's Financial Services Authority has proposed the creation of dedicated Trade Data Monitors to meet this requirement.

Another area that may see further consolidation across Europe is its settlement systems. For instance, Table A-8 shows some of the potential settlement options for the company Royal Dutch (Shell).

| Execution venue       | <b>Central Securities Depository</b> |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Euronext Amsterdam    |                                      |

Life would be a lot simpler, and more efficient, if there were a single depository like the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC). The choice of depository can also affect the trade cost since each may have different settlement costs. Therefore, liquidity aggregation is only really appropriate for prices from venues that share the same depository, as noted in a white paper on market data consolidation from Instinct (2007). Otherwise, additional costs may be incurred which are not reflected in the price. Cross-border settlement has traditionally been expensive in Europe.

A report by the Deutsche Börse Group (DBG/Clearstream) (2002) noted that wholesale trades could be 30% more expensive, whilst retail ones were up to 150% more. Thus, until there is further consolidation amongst Europe's depositories, smart order routing systems and trading algorithms will need to take these additional costs into account. Fortunately, there are some signs that this situation should improve. A subsidiary of the U.S. DTCC has launched EuroCCP, which provides a unified clearing and settlement facility that is used by Turquoise.

# Asian equity markets

The Asian equity marketplace has seen huge increases in trading volume in the last few years, as well as significant returns. However, this is much more fragmented than either Europe or the U.S. There is no common currency, or legal framework, so sovereignty is still a major factor for each country's exchanges. Despite these issues, many exchanges have started to form agreements and alliances with each other. There has also been a lot of consolidation within each country, particularly between the stock and derivative markets, c.g. Korea and Singapore.

Most of the region's execution venues support electronic trading; although, in terms of adoption, Asia is still some way behind both Europe and the U.S., particularly for the buyside. DMA and algorithmic trading have also been quite slow to take off. Though, this is changing as buy-side attention starts to focus more on execution costs. A survey by Greenwich Associates (2009) found that in 2008 electronic trading accounted for 15% of equity trading in Asia, up from 11% in 2007. This breaks down into 9% for DMA, 5% via algorithms and 1% in "dark pools" and crossing networks. They also estimate this figure could rise to 28% in three years. The Aite Group consultancy estimates that the region's algorithmic trading could increase to around 16% by 2010 from 4%, as noted by Cristina McEachern (2007). Levels of adoption are slightly higher in Japan, although uptake has been faster with foreign investors. A survey of Japanese equity trading by Greenwich Associates  $(2008)$  found that in 2008 electronic trading accounted for 17% of institutional volume. DMA increased to 9%, from 8% in 2007, whilst algorithmic trading rose from 5% in 2007 to 7% in 2008. By 2012, they project electronic trading to reach 35%, with DMA at 16% and algorithmic trading at 15% of the volume.

The Asian marketplace is dominated by exchanges and broker/dealers. Table A-9 gives a breakdown of the largest exchanges in terms of market cap. The exchanges have been quick to move to electronic trading, but for many capacity and latency still pose issues. That said, over the last few years, the pacc of upgrading exchanges has increased significantly.

Japan is still the largest market in Asia. The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is the second largest in the world (by 2008 domestic market cap). The TSE closed its trading floor and became fully electronic in 1999. Trading is purely order driven with two daily sessions of continuous trading (referred to as the Zaraba method) are augmented by call auctions (Itayose) at the open and close of each. Its trading system is known as "arrowhead", which

## **Table A-9 Asian equity markets**

went live in 2010 replacing the former CORES platform. This brings a much-anticipated boost in performance and capacity. Japan's second largest exchange, the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE), is the leading Japanese derivatives exchange, but it also lists over 1,000 companies, and is used to trade TSE listed stocks as well. The OSE has also announced plans to migrate to a new trading platform, from the NASDAQ OMX Group. Further competition is offered by the JASDAQ, a Japanese version of the NASDAQ, with a market cap now similar to the OSE. For small-cap stocks, the TSE incorporates a dedicated segment called the Mothers market, which lists around 130 stocks, with a market cap of around \$40 billion.

The Hong Kong exchange (HKEx) provides a gateway for access to mainland China. Trading is provided via an electronic order book, based on its third generation Automatic Order Matching and Execution System (AMS/3). Algorithmic trading is already established, analyst estimates put algorithmic flow at around 3-4%, as reported in Securities Industry News (SIN) (2007). In mainland China, the most important venues are the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. Both are again based on limit order books, the Shanghai's trading system is adapted from the Deutsche Börse's Xetra. The Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges saw massive annual turnover increases in 2007 (500-600%), with a corresponding increase in their overall market cap of 300-400%, based on data from the WFE (2007, 2008). If their growth continues, they will soon be serious competitors for domination of the regional marketplace. Smaller companies are catered for by Hong Kong's Growth Enterprise Market (GEM), which lists around 200 stocks.

The Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) is a product of the 2006 merger between the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange. It operates a fully electronic order book using its Integrated Trading System (ITS), which is based on NASDAQ OMX's CLICK-XT. In 2006, it altered its pricing structure from per-trade to a value based approach, mainly to encourage DMA and algorithmic trading, which now accounts for around a fifth of its order flow.

The Korea Exchange (KRX) was formed in 2005, from a merger between the Korean

Stock, Futures and KOSDAQ exchanges. This merger also incorporated the region's first ECN, founded in 2001 by Korea ECN Securities. The KRX provides an order driven trading system, with call auctions for the open and close, via its Automated Trading System (KATS). It also allows market makers to provide liquidity for less traded stocks and newer issues. For smaller companies, the KOSDAO arm of the KSX caters for around 900 stocks, with a combined market cap of around \$50 billion, making it globally just behind AIM in terms of size. Algorithmic trading is starting to take hold in Korea: In 2007, its first commercial algorithmic platform was created by a joint venture between Koscom (a subsidiary of the KRX) and Progress Apama.

The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is India's largest, by market cap, and has around 4,800 listed companies. Though, it faces stiff competition from the National Stock Exchange (NSE), which was created in 1994 to encourage market reform. Originally, the BSE was based on open outcry, its Bombay On-line Trading (BOLT) system was introduced in 1995 in response to the fully automated NSE. BOLT provides a hybrid electronic market, which incorporates two-way quotes from "jobbers", or market makers. In comparison, the NSE runs an anonymous pure limit order book, based on its National Exchange Automated Trading (NEAT) system. Brokers are also starting to offer DMA for these exchanges, a report from the Celent (2008) consultancy estimates this could reach 11% of trading by 2010. The ever-expanding trend of exchange globalisation has also seen NYSE-Euronext purchase 5% of the NSE whilst the Singapore exchange and the Deutsche Börse have each taken 5% of the BSE.

The Taiwan Stock Exchange operates a continuous limit order book together with periodic call actions for the lunch break and close. This is based on its Fully Automated Securities Trading system, which was introduced in 1993.

The Singapore Exchange (SGX) was formed in 1999 by the merger of the Stock Exchange of Singapore and the derivative Singapore International Monetary Exchange; both are based on central limit order books. SGX stock trading is carried out on its Quest-ST platform, which is based on the NASDAQ OMX's CLICK-XT exchange software. It is also planning to reduce the average bid offer spread to improve its competitiveness. Between 10 and 15% of trading is currently estimated to be traded algorithmically, as noted in an article on TradingMarkets (2007). For smaller companies, listing and trading is handled by the SESDAQ.

The Bursa Malaysia has updated its trading platform, migrating to Bursa Trade, which is based on the NSC platform from Euronext and the Atos Origin Consultancy. This provides much lower latencies (down from 5s for the old platform to milliseconds) and enables DMA. It has been handling Malaysian derivatives trading since 2006.

Alternative trading venues have yet to capture a sizeable proportion of the Asian marketplace. A report by Greenwich Associates (2007a) notes that crossing networks are expected to capture about  $1\%$  of the total market share, although this could reach up to  $3\%$  in Japan. In part, this is due to the prevalence of electronic central limit order books amongst the exchanges, as in Europe. Local regulations can also pose problems, as noted by Maria Trombly (2007). For instance, China has severe restrictions for foreign investors whilst India does not allow off-exchange crossing. Other market peculiarities can also pose problems, such as Taiwan's requirement that trades be pre-funded with cash. None of these are insurmountable, indeed alternative venues have already started to appear in Asia.

ECNs have spread to Japan, aided by their 1998 legislation for Proprietary Trading Systems (PTS). This allows the creation of private markets intended to augment the existing exchanges. Instinct's CBX ASIA was launched in 2001, providing a central limit order book for Japanese and Hong Kong equities. Likewise, in 2003 Japan Securities Agents was granted status as a PTS, providing dealers an off-exchange mechanism. SBI Holdings launched its JapanNext in 2007, catering for after-hours stock trading. Australia should see its first ECN in the form of AXE in 2009/10. Interestingly, this venture is partially owned by the New Zealand stock exchange. Instinct has also announced plans to establish Chi-X in the Asia Pacific region.

Crossing networks and "dark pool" ATSs are also spreading across the region. 2001 saw the establishment of Instinet's JapanCrossing. This PTS offers a pre-market VWAP cross as well as a morning close and an afternoon close. Though initially slow to take off, by QI 2006 it had captured around 4% of the TSE's daily turnover, this growth has continued. CLSA has launched its BlocSec ATS, providing crossings for Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia. Liquidnet brought its continuous negotiated crossing mechanism to Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea in 2007 and to Australia in 2008. ITG also has a presence in Asia; POSIT Match offers intraday crossings for Japan, Australia and Hong Kong, ITG Australia has also launched its continuous crossing system, POSIT Now, together with its POSIT Alert continuous indications system. Instinct has also released its continuous blind crossing system CBX in Japan. Other broker's liquidity pools have started appearing as well, for example, Credit Suisse's CrossFinder is live in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korca. Instinet has also established an agreement with Credit Suisse to allow mutual access to each other's liquidity pools. Combined this forms one of the largest "dark pools" of liquidity currently available in Asia.

# Summary

- $\mathbf{m}$ Electronic trading is now ubiquitous for the world's stock markets.
- Buy-side levels of adoption of DMA and algorithmic trading arc high, particularly in the U.S.
- It will still take some time before the levels of adoption for algorithmic trading in Europe and Asia reach those of the U.S., but the pace of change is increasing.
