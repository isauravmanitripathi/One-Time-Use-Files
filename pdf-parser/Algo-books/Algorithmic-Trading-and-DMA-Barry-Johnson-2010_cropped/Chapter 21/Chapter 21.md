# $Appendix E$ **Derivatives markets**

The derivatives markets are by far the largest financial markets in the world. Figures for H1 2008, from BIS (2008), show that the total notional amount outstanding reached \$766 trillion, up 25% from 2007. A breakdown of these notional amounts is given in Table E-1.

| Derivative type               |                           |         | Notional \$billions | %      |

## **Table E-1 Outstanding notional amounts for derivative contracts**

Note that forwards and forward rate agreements (FRAs) are effectively the OTC equivalent of exchange traded (ET) futures.

Unfortunately, the BIS figures do not incorporate notional amounts for exchange traded (ET) single stock or commodity derivatives. Despite these omissions, the majority of the outstanding notional is clearly for interest rate swaps, which are still generally traded OTC. In fact, around \$684 trillion of the outstanding notional is for derivatives traded OTC, 53% of which is just for interest rate swaps (IRSs).

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>15</sup> The figures for commodity-based derivatives do not include exchange traded contracts.

Most OTC derivatives are still traded manually. Therefore, in the following sub-sections we will primarily focus on the exchange traded futures and options. We shall also cover swaps and CDSs since there are now electronic platforms that cater for these as well.

# Futures and options markets

The futures and options markets primarily represent the exchange-traded segment of the derivatives marketplace. As we saw in back in Table E-I, their outstanding notional value is easily overshadowed by OTC derivatives. Though, in terms of trading volume, the positions are reversed. For instance, in 2007 over \$6 trillion worth of interest rate futures and options contracts were traded daily on the world's exchanges, compared to just over \$4 trillion traded OTC, based on data from the 2007 triennial survey by the Bank for International Scttlements BIS (2007b).

|                  | Futures    |       | Options    |       |
|------------------|------------|-------|------------|-------|

#### Table E-2 Global exchange traded futures and options market for 2008

Futures and options may be based on a wide range of underlying assets. As Table E-2 shows, there is a marked difference in trading volumes between futures and options. (Note the market volumes for futures and options are commonly compared in terms of numbers of contracts rather than their corresponding value.) Clearly, trading in futures is led by interest rate products, much like their OTC counterparts. In comparison, trading for options contracts seem to be much more concentrated on equities. Though, the high value of interest rate contracts means that these still account for over 80% of the total market turnover for both futures and options, despite their lower levels of volume, based on BIS (2007b) data.

## Asset specific

Futures and options represent agreements to buy or sell a set quantity of a certain asset, whether this is a stock, a bond or even a commodity such as oil. Where they differ is that a futures contract is binding, whilst an option contract gives the owner the right, but not the obligation to trade.

#### Futures

A forward contract is an agreement to buy (or sell) a fixed quantity of a given asset at a certain price on a specific date in the future, e.g. a contract to buy 5,000 bushels of grain in July for \$3. When the maturity date is reached, the contract expires and the transaction must then be settled. A futures contract is simply a forward with standardised terms (e.g. amounts, prices, dates) which is traded on an exchange. The standardisation makes futures more readily tradable than forwards. Historically, these contracts were focussed on commodities, since they allow both producers and consumers to hedge their risks. Much of the market liquidity is actually provided by intermediaries and/or speculators. Without them, producers and consumers would still struggle to find sufficient market liquidity, although too much speculation makes the markets volatile.

Having bought (or sold) a contract we have locked in a set price. Futures contracts are not generally held to expiry, but are instead traded out of. For example, we may have taken up a futures position just to capitalise on our view of where the market price should move to. If this still has not been reached just prior to the contract's expiry we can roll our position over to the next contract. This is achieved by selling (buying) our current position and buying (selling) the next maturing contract. So we might sell our July contract and buy an equivalent September future. Effectively, this has given us a synthetic position in the underlying asset. At expiry, if we are still holding a contract and the market price is higher then we have made money; however, if the price has fallen then we have lost the difference.

Futures contracts may be physically settled. This means that at expiry a buyer must pay the notional amount to the exchange in return for the underlying asset, whilst a seller must deliver the asset to the exchange. Alternatively, cash settlement was introduced in the early 1980s. This allowed futures to expand beyond commodities and incorporate a diverse range of financial assets, since settlement is based on a cash amount determined from the settlement price.

#### Pricing and trading

The price of a futures contract reflects the expected future value of its underlying asset, discounted to give a present value. Some other factors also need to be considered, such as any additional costs (for storage etc.) or incomes (e.g. dividends). A more detailed review of pricing futures contracts is given by Robert Kolb and James Overdahl (2006).

Clearly, the price of a futures contract is affected by the underlying asset, as well as the market's expectations of how that price will change over time. Hence, the factors that affect it are asset dependent. Single stock futures will be affected by stock specific or sector related news. Interest rate or currency futures will react to economic news and events. Agricultural futures will be affected by forecasts for crop yields and weather predictions.

In terms of risk, these contracts could have considerable exposure, since they represent trades that will take place in the future (e.g. 3, 6 or 12 months). Futures contracts remove counterparty risk since the exchange acts as a central counterparty, so the trade is effectively split into separate trades between each counterparty and the exchange. The other risks are reduced by ensuring that an initial margin is deposited with the exchange as collateral. This is then adjusted daily by marking-to-market the contract, so any resultant profits (or losses) are settled each day.

### Options

Option contracts are similar to forwards and futures in that they allow a price to be struck to trade a set quantity of a given asset at a specific future date. The settlement price is called the strike price of the option. The premium represents the actual price paid for the option. An option contract to buy is called a call, whilst a contract to sell is a put.

The main difference with forwards and futures is that the owner of an option is not obliged to trade. If the market price is more favourable they may choose not to exercise their option contract (hence its name). Though, the creator (writer) of the option contract is obliged to trade, should the purchaser wish to do so.

Options may also be classified as European or American style. This refers to when they can actually be exercised. American style options may be exercised at any time prior to the expiry date, whereas European style options may only be exercised at maturity. This flexibility means American style options usually trade at a premium to corresponding European ones.

### Pricing and trading

Options may be traded OTC or on exchanges. Like futures, exchange traded options are standardised contracts. Whilst there is generally a single future for a given maturity date, there are a wide range of options, both calls and puts for an array of strike prices. For instance, major corporations may have hundreds of exchange tradable options (if not more). Clearly, such diversity affects the available liquidity, so options tend to be less liquid than futures.

One of the main differences with options is the ability to buy and sell call and put options. For futures contracts, and their underlying cash assets, things are much simpler; we are either a natural buyer or a seller at a given price. In comparison, with options we are trading rights. The risk characteristics of these are very different: buying a put or call gives us the right to execute at the strike price, so the most we can lose is the option premium. However, writing an option obliges us to trade at the strike price if the owner wishes to exercise the contract, so our losses could potentially be infinite. Therefore, whilst there may be plenty of investors who want to buy calls or puts, much fewer may be prepared to sell them. Thus, specialised broker/dealers often play a vital role as liquidity providers and market makers.

Though pricing options can be quite complex, there are many standard models out there, such as the ubiquitous Black Scholes equation created by Fisher Black and Merton Scholes (1973). These can compute the fair value of an option based on factors such as the contract's strike price, the underlying asset's market price and its volatility, the time left to expiry and the risk-free interest rate. Other factors that may need to be considered are whether it is a European or an American option, also asset-specific factors such as dividend payments. What this means is that there are a lot more factors exerting pressure on the option price than just the market price of its underlying asset. Thus noticeable price shifts may occur even when there does not appear to be important new information, or changes in the levels of liquidity, supply and demand.

## World futures and options markets

Exchanges are still the focal point of trading for listed futures and options contracts. They provide the main inter-dealer marketplace, since membership is usually held by brokers. Client access is still reasonably segregated with brokers acting as agents for investor's orders, or dealers negotiating principal trades. Still, the increasing adoption of electronic trading has meant that clients may now access markets more directly via DMA and even algorithmic trading.

Listed derivatives may be standardised products, but they are still not as readily transferable (or fungible) as cash or equities. A futures contract or option bought from one exchange will generally not be tradable elsewhere. Consequently, the exchanges that were first to market have had the most advantage. Thus, liquidity tends to concentrate around the major exchanges. Table E-3 shows the worlds top ten exchanges in terms of traded contracts, hased on data from the WFE (2009).

## Table E-3 Global exchange traded futures and options

Competition in the marketplace has become increasingly global as exchanges try to launch equivalent products. A combination of technological innovation and reduced costs has allowed exchanges to grab market share, proven by the success of Eurex and the International Securities Exchange (ISE). This has also helped transform the marketplace, shifting from floor-based open-outcry auctions to side-by-side and fully electronic trading. In fact, most of the world's listed futures and options are now either traded electronically, or side-by-side with open-outcry.

Computerisation has also helped turn this into virtually a 24-hour marketplace. For instance, CME's Globex platform allows trading up to 23 hours each day, five days a week, starting in Asia-Pacific and following the morning through to Europe and the U.S.

#### American futures and options markets

The Americas are clearly still a major force in the listed derivatives marketplace. Half of the top ten exchanges shown in Table E-3 come from this region. Based on data from the Futures Industry Association (FIA) (2008) around 40% of both the exchange traded futures and options volume was for North American based assets.

#### **U.S. futures and options markets**

The U.S. is clearly one of the main markets for exchange-listed derivatives. In fact, it dominated the global futures and options marketplace until the late '90s, when competition arrived from venues such as Eurex and Liffe. Table E-4 shows the breakdown of the 2008 figures for futures and options trading on the major U.S. exchanges.

The last few years have seen a considerable shift with the major U.S. exchanges increasingly moving from floor-based to electronic trading. Nowadays, at least 75-85% of the most liquid contracts are traded electronically. Many brokers/vendors provide DMA access to the major exchanges. Some brokers have even started expanding their algorithmic trading offerings to incorporate futures and options trading. Though, the adoption of these low-touch strategies still lags behind the equities market. A review of equity derivative trading by the TABB Group (2007d) consultancy estimates that around 47% of futures traders used DMA whilst 53% still used the phone. They also found that only 27% of options traders adopted DMA, with the remainder again using the phone. By 2009, they predict that DMA uptake may have risen to 58% and 40% respectively for futures and options trading. Overall, they noted that 68% of buy-side derivatives orders were handled by high-touch

trading with only 32% adopting low-touch strategies. Again, by 2009 they expect the adoption of low-touch strategies, such as DMA and algorithmic trading, to increase to 40%. Interestingly, they also found that smaller firms seemed to be adopting these new techniques more rapidly than larger ones.

#### Table E-4 U.S. exchange traded futures and options

The U.S.'s two largest derivatives exchanges, namely the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) merged in 2007. Whilst this has created a huge local monopoly, it is more understandable from a global point of view, since the combined entity has a similar daily volume to Eurex, which has merged with the International Securities Exchange (ISE).

The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) originated from the Chicago Butter and Egg Board; however, it has since moved away from agricultural contracts and is now one of the world's leading financial exchanges. This shift may be traced back to 1972 when it created the world's first financial futures. These were currency futures for British pounds, Canadian dollars, Deutsche marks, French francs, Japanese yen, Mexican pesos and Swiss francs. Nowadays, currency trading only accounts for around 10% of CME's volume. The majority of its trading is from interest rate products. The most important of which is the Eurodollar, a short-term debt contract that it introduced back in 1981. The Eurodollar was the world's first cash settled future; it is now the most traded futures contract and a key benchmark for U.S. short-term debt. Together with Eurodollar options, they account for around half of the volume traded on the CME. Equity index contracts account for another third of the CME's volume. The Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 index future was first introduced in 1982, whilst the NASDAQ-100 contract was created in 1996. Though, CME index trading volumes are now dominated by their E-mini counterparts. E-mini futures were first introduced in 1997; they are a fifth of the size and traded electronically. They have proven to be extremely popular, particularly with portfolio hedgers and retail investors. The most important of which is the E-mini S&P 500 index future, the 2<sup>nd</sup> most traded listed derivative in the world, based on the 2008 review by the FIA (2009). Other indices such as the NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and 2000 and the S&P MidCap 400 are also catered for. Globally, the CME continues to face stiff competition, which has helped spur the migration of volume from the floor to Globex, its trading system. Globex provides an electronic order book, as well as supporting lead market makers. This second-generation system was introduced in 2002, based around the NSC trading engine. In fact, the majority of trading is now carried out on Globex.

The Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) has also become predominantly a financial exchange. Although nearly a fifth of its daily volume is still attributable to agricultural, metal and energy based contracts. The most important contracts are based on long-term interest rate futures; namely the 10 year Treasury Note, followed by the 5 year note and 30 year bond futures. The CBOT has faced competition from the bond market, where lower spreads made it cheaper to trade treasuries, whilst in 2004 Eurex also started listing Treasury note and bond futures. In response, it has shifted more trading away from open-outcry auction to be electronic. Originally, its electronic order book was based on Liffe's Connect platform; however, this has now been completely migrated to Globex in line with its merger with the CME. Electronic trading now accounts for the majority of trading. Settlement is straightforward since CBOT already used the CME to clear its trades.

The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) is another venue that has had to rapidly embrace electronic trading in the face of new global competition, in particular from the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE). Primarily, NYMEX is an exchange for energy-based derivatives although it also handles contracts for metals. Its electronic trading platform is provided by the CME's Globex, which has helped it realise a sizeable increase in trading volumes. In 2008, it became part of the CME Group.

The remaining exchanges shown in Table E-4 are mainly involved in the trading of U.S. equity options, which we will review more fully in the next sub-section.

There are also some other U.S. exchanges which cater for derivatives trading, such as OneChicago and the U.S. Futures Exchange. OneChicago is a joint venture between the CME Group, CBOE, and the IB Exchange Corp. It provides a fully electronic exchange, primarily for single stock futures but also futures on ETFs. Lead Market Makers ensure liquidity and the platform is based on the CBOEdirect match engine, although it also caters for Globex users. The U.S. Futures Exchange (USFE), formerly Eurex U.S., is another Chicago-based electronic futures exchange. It offers futures on a variety of fixed income, equity and commodity based funds/indices, as well as new derivative products. For example, it offered a binary event future based on the outcome of a CME-CBOT merger.

Further local competition is also arriving. NYSE Liffe U.S. was launched in 2008, based on the precious metals business it bought from the CME Group. It will also have transatlantic links to Europe's Liffe exchange. The NASDAQ OMX Futures Exchange (NFX), formerly the Philadelphia Boards of Trade (PBOT), offers trading of futures for interest rates swaps, currency and sector indices. Also the Electronic Liquidity Exchange (ELX) was launched in 2009, backed by a consortium of major brokers, institutions and technology firms. Its electronic exchange is based on the eSpeed platform. Initially, it is targeting trading for treasury futures, although it also plans to cover other key assets in the future.

ATSs are starting to appear for derivatives as well. LiquidityPort has announced plans to offer an electronic block-trading platform for both futures and options contracts.

#### **U.S equity options market**

The U.S. equity option marketplace has seen some of the highest levels of growth of any of the world's listed derivatives markets. Having noted that most futures and options are not fungible, this marketplace is an interesting exception since a common clearing mechanism ensures that the options are readily transferable. Therefore, U.S. stock options may be traded on any one of seven exchanges, making this the most competitive listed option marketplace in the world. Figure E-1 highlights the difference in growth between the U.S. equity option marketplace and the rest of the world.

#### Figure E-1 Global Exchange Traded Equity Option growth

Figure E-1 also shows the disparity in growth between option trading for equities and indices. Admittedly, this is not all attributable to market competition, but also due to changing investment and hedging styles. Nevertheless, it does help emphasise just how important competition can be.

There has been a phenomenal growth in the trading of U.S. equity options. This the largest market of its kind in the world, accounting for nearly two thirds of the globally traded volume. As a marketplace, it has become a microcosm of its cousin, the stock market. Trading is now dispersed amongst seven main venues. Table E-5 shows a breakdown of their trading volumes. Unlike many other markets there now a split in how venues actually match orders, with the newer venues such as NYSE Area, Boston and NASDAQ all offering a price/time based order book, rather than the pro-rata matching traditionally offered by the other derivatives exchanges.

Much of the current market structure is due to changes in regulation. This dates back to 1999 when the Justice Department and the SEC won settlements agreeing that competition had been blocked by selective trading practices. Suddenly, by the end of the year stock options were no longer concentrated at specific venues, but instead could be traded at any of the options exchanges. The resultant competition helped reduce spreads and led to a significant increase in overall trading volumes. Decimalisation has also helped, so in 2007 the SEC instigated a pilot program to further reduce the tick size from \$0.05 to \$0.01. Early indications are that this "penny pilot" program is working. However, it also appears to have encouraged even lower trade sizes and higher overall volumes, mimicking the effect seen in the equities market. New portfolio margining regulations that allow positions to be netted may well cause a further increase in volumes, since they help lower the cost of entry.

Algorithmic trading is starting to take hold as well. A report by the TABB Group (2009) consultancy found that 23% of the hedge funds and 9% of the long-only funds they surveyed were already using trading algorithms.

The International Securities Exchange (ISE) has rapidly become the leading exchange for U.S. equity options, since its creation in 2000, with repeated year on year growth of over 30%. Its trading system is based on NASDAQ OMX's CLICK platform. Trading is via a hybrid mechanism, based on a fully electronic order book with both primary and secondary

market makers. The ISE also allows order preferencing (for specific market makers) as well as directed orders, which initiate a price improvement mechanism (effectively a one-second bilateral auction). Block crossing is catered for as well; a separate mechanism advertises the order to members who may then respond with the prices and sizes at which they are willing to trade. It has led the way in terms of transparency, ensuring that the top three price levels of the order book are visible. The ISE has also announced plans to develop a new global trading system that will replace its current system in early 2011. The new system is a joint development project between the technology teams at the ISE and the Deutsche Börse Group.

The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) was the world's first equity options exchange, founded in 1973. In response to the increasingly competitive marketplace, it has created a hybrid trading system. This blends its floor-based technology with CBOE Direct, its dedicated electronic trading platform. Designated primary market makers are responsible for overseeing the market for each stock's options. Additional liquidity is provided by "incrowd" and remote market makers.

The NASDAQ OMX PHLX (formerly the Philadelphia Stock Exchange) provides another hybrid electronic market. This was formerly based on the PHLX XL system, but has since been migrated to the INET platform. There are still specialists, and other market makers may participate as well. Order flow may also be directed to specific dealers. NASDAQ OMX has another separate venue, the NASDAQ Options Market, which went live in 2008. This is based on INET as well, but it adopts a price/time priority.

NYSE Area's involvement with options dates back to the Pacific Exchange, which merged with Archipelago to form Arca, before merging with the NYSE. This electronic market uses Lead Market Makers to provide liquidity, particularly for the more thinly traded options, in return they are guaranteed 40% of the incoming order flow (so long as they are quoting at the NBBO). The NYSE has also bolstered its offering by incorporating the Amex (formerly the American Stock Exchange), which has moved its trading floor to the NYSE and has migrated to the Arca platform.

Between the options exchanges there is an inter-market linkage program, which aims to ensure that market orders execute with the NBBO. This is due to be replaced with a decentralised order routing approach, similar to the U.S. equity markets. Liquidity aggregation is also starting to be offered by some vendors. For example, Orc Software has launched a U.S. Options Montage, which consolidates quotes across all the exchanges and allows smart order routing to achieve best execution.

Current regulation means that ECNs/ATSs are not yet possible since trades must be handled by an exchange, as pointed out in an article by Emily Fraser (2007). However, new platforms to allow block crossing are still being created For instance, 2008 saw the launch of Ballista. This provides a hybrid approach, combining auctions with electronic negotiations. Each order is placed in an electronic auction, which is open to other members for up to five minutes; the user can also specify how much information the order reveals (size or direction). A successful counter bid from another member then triggers an exclusive negotiation between the two. Ballista also allows members to place orders for complex strategies, comprising of up to three option legs and/or their underlying stock. Meanwhile Pipeline's Archangel takes a different approach. It adopts a blind auction, similar to those used for portfolio trading. Therefore, participants only have access to the key characteristics of the available orders. So decisions are based on risk factors such as the "Greeks" (delta, gamma, theta etc), order size indications and other static information such as the industry sector. Once a match is agreed, the orders are then routed to the corresponding venues, such as the CBOE or ISE. In addition to protecting the details of orders, this model-driven approach should also improve the number of matches. Given the size of the option universe, finding an exact match for a specific contract would otherwise be difficult. If (or once) the trading regulations change we may well see other entrants look to expand into the block crossing space.

**Other American Futures and Options Markets** Though dwarfed by their U.S. counterparts Latin America still has some of the world's largest derivatives exchanges, as shown in Table E-6.

#### **Table E-6 Other American futures and options exchanges**

Brazil has the region's two largest exchanges. The São Paulo Stock Exchange (BOVESPA) caters for equity options, whilst the Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros (BM&F) covers fixed income, currency and commodity hased contracts. These merged in 2008 to become BM&FBOVESPA. Their main contract is a one-day inter-bank deposit future; in fact, in 2007 this was the 9<sup>th</sup> most traded listed derivative, according to the FIA (2008). Their trading systems are based on the order-driven NSC platform. Although there is still some open-outcry trading, much of the volume has become electronic. They have been keen to encourage DMA access as well. In 2009, they established a link to route orders to the CME; this is also used to allow CME users to trade BM&F contracts.

The Mexican Derivatives Exchange was founded in 1998. Its most successful contract is a future based on a short-term interest rate, the THE 28 day inter-bank rate, which was the  $11^{\text{th}}$ most actively traded derivative in 2007, based on the FIA (2008) report. It also offers a range of other fixed income, equity and FX contracts. The exchange provides a fully automated and anonymous marketplace, as well as supporting FIX.

## **EMEA** futures and options markets

Over the last ten years, the major European derivative exchanges have consolidated their position as leading venues in the global marketplace. Certainly, the merger between the CME and CBOT owes much to their competition. Table E-7 outlines the breakdown in terms of traded contracts in 2008 for the region's top exchanges.

## Table E-7 Top European futures and options exchanges

Eurex originated in 1998 from a merger of the Deutsche Terminbörse (DTB) and the SWG's SOFFEX derivative markets. It offers a fully electronic order book with provision for market makers to supply liquidity. By 1999, it had become the world's largest futures and options exchange. Eurex's success led the way for trading electronically, causing the openoutcry based venues to re-examine the benefits of electronic access. Its most heavily traded contracts are fixed income benchmark futures, namely the Euro-Bund (10y), Euro-Bobl (5y) and the Euro-Schatz (2y), together with futures and options for the Dow-Jones Euro Stoxx 50 stock index. Eurex is the leading marketplace for European stock options and has also expanded into single stock futures, becoming the world's third largest exchange for these. In 2007 Eurex merged with the International Securities Exchange (ISE), adding considerably to its market share of the option and U.S. markets, and creating a truly global exchange.

The London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), founded in 1982, was initially modelled on the CBOT and CME open-outcry markets. Mergers with other London derivative markets led it to become Europe's leading derivatives exchange by 1996. Still, it faced increasing competition from the DTB and subsequently Eurex, causing it to shift to a fully automated marketplace by 2000. In 2002 Liffe was acquired by Euronext, which already incorporated the derivatives markets for Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, most notably the MATIF. Liffe has remained an important competitor in the global derivatives marketplace. Trading on Liffe is based on an order book, running on the Connect system. Liffe's main contracts are its short-term interest rate futures, namely the Euribor (3m) and Sterling (3m) futures. Trading volumes are lower for equity and index based contracts; but an article by Joe Morgan (2007) notes that these have seen a steady increase in automated trading, with levels reaching up to 50% for the more liquid contracts. This is encouraged by their liquidity provider system, which gives market makers a mass quoting facility, enabling them to rapidly submit updates, which is particularly useful for options.

The South African Futures Exchange (SAFEX) merged with the Johannesburg Securities Exchange (JSE) in 2001. Offering fully automated trading it has since become the world's most active exchange for single stock futures.

The NASDAQ OMX derivatives market is dominated by equity derivative trading, with futures and options for both single stocks and indices. Trading for these is fully electronic, based on the CLICK trading platform. For fixed income derivatives, SAXESS is used by designated market makers to provide indicative quotes. Note that the actual trading for these takes place off-exchange, and is separately reported to the NASDAQ OMX for clearing.

The IntercontinentalExchange was created in 2000, with the intention of creating a fully electronic around-the-clock energy exchange. A year later, it incorporated the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) to become ICE Futures. ICE offers a hybrid marketplace; market makers provide firm quotes, whilst centralised credit management allows anonymous order matching. ICE's Brent crude oil futures are the fourth most highly traded futures contract globally. It has become competition for NYMEX, particularly with its new West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil contract. ICE has continued to expand, buying the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT) in 2007; it also sought a merger with CBOT.

Further competition is also starting to appear in Europe. A group of broker/dealers has announced Project Rainbow, a derivatives equivalent of Turquoise. This plans to compete with the established exchanges, initially for short term interest rate contracts.

#### Asian futures and options markets

Asia lags both the U.S. and Europe in terms of the number of futures and options contracts traded on exchanges, except for the behemoth that is the Korean options market. Table E-8 shows the top exchanges based on the number of contracts traded in 2008.

|                                | Number of contracts traded in 2008 (millions) |         |         |  |

#### **Table E-8 Top Asian futures and options exchanges**

The KOSPI 200 options, traded on the Korea Exchange, lead the global exchange traded derivatives volume. Alone they account for 45% of the total volume traded by the top ten contracts in 2008, based on the FIA (2009) report, and around 15% of the global volume. Trading by institutions and foreign investors makes up around 60% of the volume, although historically retail trading was more dominant. Since much of the retail trading was speculative, this trend has meant the volatility of the KOSPI has declined. As the market matures, the rapid growth in trading for these contracts has also declined slightly. Trading is based on an electronic order book provided by the KOSPI futures-trading-system, which has proven able to cope with these huge trading volumes.

The National Stock Exchange of India is currently the world's second most active market for single stock futures. The rest of its volume is mainly from index futures trading for the S&P CNX Nifty, the leading 50 stocks on the NSE.

China's largest derivatives exchange is the Dalian Commodity Exchange, which specialises in agricultural commodity futures. Electronic trading is available, based on its own dedicated platform. Most of its trading volume is in contracts for corn and soy meal, for which it is the world's largest market. Other agricultural contracts, such as sugar, cotton and wheat are tradable on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange. Metal, rubber and fuel contracts are traded on the electronic Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE). Exchange trading of purely financial derivatives has not yet taken off. That said, 2006 saw the foundation of the China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX), its first exchange dedicated to purely financial derivatives. The first traded contract will be a future on the CSI-300 (China Securities Index). Note that futures contracts will provide a way to synthetically short stocks, which is not currently possible on the cash market. Once the CSI-300 has gone live, contracts for bonds and currency are also expected. Commodity options are also likely to be introduced. Another dedicated commodities exchange should be launched in 2009/10, the Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange. Initially, its focus will be on oil contracts, the platform will be based on Cinnober's TRADExpress system. The U.S. has also been eager to capitalise on China's rapid growth, for instance, the CME has launched a mini-futures contract linked to an index for China's top 25 equities (by market cap).

The Australian Securities Exchange was formed in 2006 by a merger between the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) and the Australian Stock Exchange. Listed derivative trading has been electronic since 1999 when the SFE closed its trading floor. Its SYCOM trading system provides 24 hours access and includes a FIX gateway. The most heavily traded contract is the future for the 3 year Treasury bond; there is also significant trading for the S&P/ASX 200 stock index as well as other fixed income futures, ranging from 90-day bank bills to 10year treasury honds.

The Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) is fully electronic, based on its in-house Electronic Trading System. Around 85% of its trading volume is accounted for by TAIEX index options, whilst nearly another 10% is for the TAIEX future. It has started supporting DMA and is looking to provide spread order functionality. The exchange has also begun listing dollar-based contracts and is looking to expand the range of futures, which may be traded by foreign investors.

In Japan, financial derivatives are traded on separate exchanges. Equity index contracts are traded on the corresponding stock exchanges. The Nikkei 225 is catered for by the Osaka SE; currently the most successful contract is the Nikkei 225 mini future, which was introduced in 2006. The TSE handles derivatives for the TOPIX; it also provides sector index futures. In 2009, it released its new options trading platform Tdex+, based on Liffe Connect. In terms of fixed income contracts, the Tokyo Financial Exchange (TFX, formerly TIFFE) trades contracts for the 3 month Euro-Yen; its platform is also based on Liffe Connect. Futures and options on JGB bonds are actually traded on the TSE. For commodity derivatives, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) is the largest venue, with a market share of nearly 70%. Primarily, it trades contracts for gold and other metals, rubber, gasoline and other energy products. It has offered electronic trading since 1991 with a continuous market as well as call auctions. In 2009, it saw a major upgrade with a trading engine from NASDAQ OMX. Note there are three other commodity exchanges, the Central Japan Commodity Exchange (C-COM), the Tokyo Grain Exchange (TGE) and the Kansai Commodity Exchange (KEX). Although this is down from 16 in 1989, it is quite likely that further consolidation will occur for Japan's derivatives exchanges.

## Swaps markets

Swaps are one of the most important types of derivative, accounting for around half the global outstanding notional value in the first half of 2008, as we saw back in Table E-1. Essentially, a swap is an agreement between two counterparties to exchange cash streams. These streams may be linked to fixed/floating interest rates, currencies, or even dividend payments. Thus, they offer a flexible means of controlling cash flows, which goes some of the way to explaining their popularity.

Swaps are still essentially viewed as an OTC derivative. Though, the sheer volume of interest rate swaps means there can be considerable liquidity for the more standardised contracts. Hence, electronic trading is becoming more important.

#### Asset specific

A swap contract is a bilateral agreement to exchange cash streams for a principal amount over a set time period. Generally, the associated cash streams are based on interest rates or currencies (or both), although they can also incorporate flows from equities or commodities. For example, a cash stream might correspond to the income or interest payments from a specific bond, the interest rate of a specific fixing (such as LIBOR) or the gains/losses from marking to market a stock position. As with bonds, swaps may be classified by the maturity date: short-term range from a week to less than 1-2 years, medium term range from 1-10 years whilst long term may last up to 50 years. Swaps give organisations an extremely flexible means of controlling their cash streams, although their individuality also means they have primarily been traded OTC.

The commonest type is an Interest Rate Swap (IRS). Note that the principal (or notional) amount is not actually exchanged; only the associated interest payments are swapped. A vanilla interest rate swap consists of one lcg based on a floating rate of interest whilst the other is based on a fixed rate. For the floating leg, the actual payments are determined by the fixing schedules for the interest rate, e.g. quarterly for the three-month London Interbank Overnight Rate (LIBOR), whilst the fixed leg is usually paid semi-annually. Alternatively, a basis swap is one where both legs are based on floating rates, albeit with different fixing sources or schedules.

As its name suggests, a currency swap adds exchange rates into the mix. However, it also requires exchange of the notional amount at maturity and optionally at the start of the contract. This allows companies to borrow in the currency where they can obtain the best interest rate then convert it to the currency they actually need. The most common type of currency swap involves a floating U.S. dollar rate (often based on LIBOR) with a fixed rate in another foreign currency. Note that a currency swap should not be confused with a forex swap, which just represents an exchange of currencies. A forex swap is the combination of a spot FX transaction together with a forward contract to reverse this initial exchange and so close out the deal; interest payments are not involved. Effectively, a forex swap represents a spread trade between the spot FX rate and the forward rate.

An overnight indexed swap (OIS) is similar to a vanilla IRS, with a leg linked to an overnight fixing. At maturity, the difference between the accrued interest for the fixed rate and the average of the floating rates is exchanged. These are usually short-term swaps with maturities ranging from a week to two years.

A total return swap exchanges periodic interest payments for the total return of an asset or basket of assets. This allows investors access to capital gains, without having to actually hold the asset/s, since the ownership is not transferred. Effectively, they provide the purchaser

with a synthetic position in the given asset. If a large price drop or even a default occurs then the purchaser will actually have to compensate the seller. So they are exposed to both the asset's market and credit risk. An equity swap is basically a total return swap based on an underlying stock, portfolio or stock index.

Asset swaps are the combination of an interest rate swap with a fixed rate bond, where the interest from the bond should be sufficient to pay for the swap rate (the IRS fixed rate). Therefore, the swap effectively cancels out the interest rate risk of the bond, leaving the holder exposed to a mix of bond credit risk and counterparty risk for the swap.

Other, more exotic types of swaps are also available, including features such as being callable or incorporating price ratcheting, but these are beyond the scope of this book.

#### Global swaps markets

The global market for swaps is huge; its notional value has increased nearly eight-fold since 1998 to over \$370 trillion in the first half of 2008. Of this, interest rate swaps account for over  $95\%$ , whilst less than  $5\%$  is due to currency swaps.

In terms of trading volume, interest rate swaps had an average daily turnover of \$1.21 trillion in 2007, based on data from BIS (2007b). That is about double the volume recorded in their 2004 triennial survey, which in turn was double the value for 2001. Clearly, the growth in turnover is considerable. In comparison, currency swaps had a daily turnover of around \$80 billion in 2007, although this is actually four times its 2004 level.

Swaps are generally for the Euro and U.S. dollar. In fact, over 44% of interest rate swaps are based on the Euro and 27% on the dollar. In comparison, only 10% are for U.K. sterling, 9% for Japanese Yen and the remaining 10% covers all other currencies. Likewise, three quarters of all currency swaps involve the dollar. The sizeable volumes of Euro denominated swaps may seem surprising. However, for the Eurozone swaps have proven invaluable as a means of generating pan-European interest rates, as Joseph Mariathasan and Mark Bannister  $(2007)$  point out. This is also reflected by the fact that around 42.5% of the trading is based in London, whilst the U.S. only accounts for around  $23.8\%$ .

The maturities of swaps are spread relatively evenly, with around 38% of interest rate swaps lasting up to a year, 36% between one to five years and around 26% for even longer periods, based on the BIS (2007c) report. Whilst for currency swaps the BIS data shows that around three quarters of them are arranged for less than a year.

The swap marketplace is still strongly segmented with separate inter-dealer and dealer-toclient markets. In terms of electronic trading, progress has actually been faster in the dealerto-client segment, although the inter-dealer space is catching up. A report from the Celent (2006) consultancy estimates that by 2009 electronic dealer-to-client trading should account for around 42% of the market, up from 9% in 2006, whilst inter-dealer trading may reach around 22%. In Europe, a study by the ECB (2009) found that interest rate swaps had reached around 16% electronic trading by 2008, whilst for overnight indexed swaps it was only 8%.

Competition is growing in the inter-dealer market. The first dedicated electronic marketplace for these was e-MIDER, created in 2000 by a consortium of banks, based on a request for quote mechanism. Although, at present, the two main inter-dealer systems providing the widest range of electronic swap trading are i-Swap and the Swapstream, both introduced in 2003. The ICAP brokerage's i-Swap caters for overnight, short and mediumterm interest rate swaps. Although initially the focus has been on the euro, it also supports trading in pounds, dollars and yen. Orders may be entered electronically and are also transcribed from phone-dealing into a visible order book. This hybrid marketplace is actually based on the NASDAQ OMX's X-stream platform. i-Swap also supports implied orders, allowing additional liquidity from trading strategies such as spreads. The CME bought Swapstream in 2006; it offers trading for U.S. dollar and euro swaps versus Libor or Euribor with maturities from 6 months to 30 years as well as short-term overnight indexed swaps. EuroMTS has also launched a dedicated swap market for trading overnight indexed swaps.

The dealer-to-client segment consists of a mix of single and multi-dealer platforms. Barclay's were quick to capitalise on the opportunity offered by electronic trading, displaying live prices via Bloomberg and setting up a dedicated trading system in 2003. Since then, other brokers have gone on to release their own trading platforms. Other vendors have also been keen to create swap trading platforms; Reuters introduced its Matching for Interest Rates in 2004 followed by Bloomberg's SwapTrader and Tradeweb in 2005. These cater for short, medium and long-term euro and dollar swaps, generally using an RFQ mechanism to allow prices to be compared between several dealers before trading. Tradeweb also supports streaming (RFS) prices for Euro and GBP interest rate swaps. The hanks and exchanges have noticed the success of these systems, and are working on their own competing platforms. The CME has also introduced sPro, a dealer-to-client version of Swapstream, which offers a hybrid market with streaming prices. LiquidityHub was proposed as a gateway for brokers to provide streaming prices for euro and dollar swaps, although the 2007-09 financial crisis helped put an end to this project.

Centralised clearing is starting to be offered for swaps trading as well, which may help further increase the adoption of electronic trading platforms. In particular, the CME has introduced Clearing360, which provides a mechanism for substituting interest rate forwards and swaps. Indeed, one of the main advantages of swaps traded on Swapstream is that they are centrally cleared through CME Clearing 360. Hence, this platform offers full straightthrough-processing (STP) for electronic swaps trading.

# Credit derivative markets

Credit derivatives were first created in 1990s as banks sought custom guarantees to hedge and diversify the credit risk associated with their loans. They have rapidly become a major asset class, enabling investors to trade credit risk without having to actually manage or fund loans. As Nishul Saperia and Jean Gross (2008) point out, increasing standardisation and a ready supply has allowed traders to track a single credit spread curve for any given entity, as opposed to following a large range of bonds. This led the credit derivative market to become a primary indicator of creditworthiness. In fact, they note that the volume of trading in credit derivatives outstripped the volume of bonds outstanding some time ago.

Although still primarily traded OTC, noteworthy steps have been made in the electronic trading of credit derivatives.

## Asset specific

Credit derivatives act as financial guarantees that may be used to provide protection against a variety of credit events, but most typically default or bankruptcy. They include single entity credit default swaps, basket swaps, index-based credit swaps and synthetic collateralised debt obligations as well as some other credit based products.

A credit default swap (CDS) is a contract in which the credit risk for a notional amount of debt issued from one (or more) entities is transferred. The purchaser gains protection from this credit risk, whilst the seller is paid regular premiums for the lifetime of the contract. If a credit event occurs then the seller must compensate the purchaser and the contract expires. The key features, which differentiate each CDS, are the:

- Coverage, in terms of entities and notional amount of debt
- $\bullet$ Premium payments
- Types of credit event allowed  $\bullet$
- Settlement procedures

CDSs provide credit protection for debt issued from a variety of entities, ranging from companies to governments or their agencies. Note that when multiple entities are involved the swap is sometimes referred to as a basket CDS. The notional amounts vary depending on the entity's credit rating. Generally, investment grade CDSs have a notional value of around \$10-20 million whilst riskier, higher yield contracts are often between \$2-5 million. The allowed eredit events may range from failure to pay, defaulting or bankruptcy, to debt restructuring or credit rating changes.

The required premium, or spread, is based on the credit rating of the entities and the notional amount of debt to be covered. The typical maturity for a CDS contract is five years. Generally, the premium is quoted in terms of basis points per annum, and paid quarterly. Note that for constant maturity swaps the credit spread is periodically reset based on the eurrent market level.

Like futures, CDSs may be settled either physically or via a cash settlement. When triggered by a credit event physical settlement means the purchaser must deliver the corresponding debt in exchange for the eash notional amount from the seller. Though, cash settlement is becoming increasingly popular. This requires the seller to pay the difference between the notional amount and the current market value. Often, post-default the current market value will be determined by an auction of the defaulted debt, such as the Credit Event Auctions administered by Creditex and Markit, more details of this are given in Saperia and Gross (2008).

A credit-linked note is effectively a funded CDS that provides securitisation to protect the purchaser against counterparty risk. In ease of default, this acts as a guarantee to ensure that the buyer is compensated. Often this is achieved through an intermediary special purpose company.

CDS indices represent a natural evolution from single entity or basket CDSs. These standardised eredit swaps often cover more than a hundred separate companies. Usually, these are equally weighted so each company is covered by an equal share of the notional amount. They have proven to be incredibly popular, since they allow investors to make much broader macro trades for credit risk. In addition, it is possible to buy or sell tranches of CDS indices, allowing investors to define limits for the protection coverage. For instance, a 3-7% tranche for the CDX index means that protection is provided for losses of between 3 and 7% of the notional amount, but not above or below these levels. Leading exchanges have even started to offer futures and options based on underlying CDS indices.

Another use for CDSs has been for structured products that involve credit risk. Collateralized debt obligations (CDO) are asset-backed securities based on an underlying portfolio of bonds or loans. A synthetic CDO replaces these underlying assets with credit default swaps, the income from which is invested in low risk bonds. Effectively, a synthetic CDO is a portfolio of CDSs combined with low risk assets.

Pricing credit derivatives is non-trivial. Unlike an interest rate swap, we must also incorporate the probability of default together with the recovery price for the asset. A variety of methods are used to price credit derivatives, but these are beyond the scope of this book. A brief review is provided by Brian Eales (2007) and David Mengle (2007). These sources also provide a more detailed review of credit derivatives in general.

## Global credit derivative markets

Credit derivatives have experienced phenomenal growth over the last ten years. In 1997, the global notional outstanding volume was just \$180 billion. For 2008 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association Inc. (2009) reported a total notional outstanding of \$38.6 trillion. Admittedly, the credit crunch has dampened the growth of the credit markets; in fact, the 2008 figure was down 38% from the 2007 year-end. The 200% increase in outstanding notional between 2005 and 2007 now seems a distant memory. Still, it is important to remember that credit derivatives are well established as a major asset class.

Trading is focussed in London and New York, each with around a 40% market share, whilst the rest of Europe accounts for around 10%. In terms of asset types, much of the trading is concentrated on CDSs and CDS indices, each accounting for over 30% of the market whilst CDOs account for around 16%, based on the 2006 Credit Derivatives Report from the British Bankers' Association (BBA) (2006). In terms of maturity, B1S (2007c) note that around 60% of the CDSs range between one to five years whilst another third arc for periods longer than this.

Standardisation has played an important role in the level of growth which credit derivative trading has achieved. Standards have helped make the contracts and transactions more uniform. But the most noticeable impact has been from the introduction of CDS indices. These have experienced an extraordinary surge in usage since 2004, when they had less than 10% market share, based on the BBA (2006). In Europe, much of this is due to the enhanced liquidity that arose from the 2004 merger of the iBoxx and Trac-X indices into the iTraxx Europe, which consists of 125 investment grade companies. The Dow Jones CDX is the main U.S. index, covering investment grade debt from 125 North American corporations. There are also a wide range of other indices covering Asia, emerging markets as well as high yield and specific industry sectors.

Credit derivatives are still generally traded OTC with brokers. Though, electronic trading is making noteworthy progress, particularly for the more standardised products such as CDS indices. A report by the Celent (2004) consultancy noted that around 25% of index based trading was electronic, predicting it would increase to around 50% by 2007. These predictions seem to have been met in Europe, where a Euromoney (2008a) report notes that around 45% of inter-dealer transactions were electronic. Adoption in North America and Asia is still at an early stage. The rate of progress for less standardised products, such as single entity CDSs, is also likely to be slower.

The inter-broker market has a range of electronic platforms which cater for CDSs, most notably Creditcx's RealTime platform, GFI's CreditMatch and ICAP's BrokerTec. The Euromoncy (2008a) report notes that these three accounted for 90% of the European interdealer market. The focus has primarily been on the liquid CDS indices, although systems are increasingly catering for single entity CDSs and other less liquid products. In addition, to cater for correlation trading, vendors are also starting to provide for trading large portfolios of single entity CDSs. These orders can be huge, with aggregate notional amounts of more than a billion dollars and encompassing over 100 CDSs. In particular, in 2007 Creditex launched a platform dedicated to handling such trades (called Q-WIXX), providing live prices from up to four different dealers.

In the dealer-to-client market, electronic trading has seen less significant uptake. Initially,

single vendor systems were the norm, such as those from BNP Paribas and Barclays Capital. Multi-dealer platforms have also started to appear, in the form of MarketAxess and Tradeweb. Again, the initial focus has been on the highly liquid CDS indices, based around an RFQ trading mechanism. Both platforms have integrated real-time prices to provide users with indicative quotes. It is also likely that vendors will soon cater for clients who require CDS portfolio trading.

The leading exchanges have proven keen to enter the credit market as well, starting with the Eurex's launch of futures based on the iTraxx indices. In the U.S., the CBOT announced an index future based on the CDR Liquid 50 index. The CME has also announced a joint venture with the Citadel Investment Group LLC for a CDS trading platform called CDMX. This will provide an RFQ mechanism for trading both single entity and CDS indices, coupled with a central counterparty clearing facility. Whilst the CBOE also has plans for CDS based options. At the moment, it is still too early to gauge how successful these ventures will prove to be, but given the size of this market, even a small percentage would be important.

The 2007-09 financial crisis also focussed attention on the clearing and settlement procedures for credit derivatives. The counterparty risk associated with CDS contracts made it hard to trade out of them, particularly with the collapse of several major banks. Hence, regulators are seeking to mandate centralised clearinghouses to try to reduce this risk. In the U.S, centralised clearing proposals from NYSE Euronext Liffe and the CME have already been approved. Likewise in Europe there is growing support for central counterparties, with a number of hanks already committed to using them. Centralised clearing should also make it easier to implement fully electronic trading platforms in the future, as Ivy Schmerken (2009) points out.

Streamlining the settlement process is also important to allow for continued market growth. In fact, the 2006 BBA report highlights that trade confirmations were more than two months late for almost 10% of trades. Tales of huge back-office backlogs for settlement are not unheard of. That said, steps are being made to improve the provision of straight-through processing. For instance, vendors such as T-Zero now offer dedicated platforms to streamline the confirmation and assignment processes.

## Summary

- Electronic trading is now commonplace for listed derivatives (futures and options); it  $\blacksquare$ is even available for swaps and credit derivatives, which traditionally are traded OTC.
- $\blacksquare$ Algorithmic trading is becoming established for listed derivatives, particularly futures. The rapid growth and fragmentation of the U.S. equity options marketplace means this is likely to be a focal point for algorithm development as well.
- Other derivatives may also be electronically traded as part of cross-asset trading  $\blacksquare$ strategies.
