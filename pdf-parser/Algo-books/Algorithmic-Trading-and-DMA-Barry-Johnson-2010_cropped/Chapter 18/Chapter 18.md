# $Appendix B$ **Fixed income** markets

The fixed income marketplace accounts for a third of the global financial market, in terms of value, as we saw back in Chapter 3. Fixed income trading has developed around the OTC mechanism, mainly because the assets are much less standardised than stocks. However, strong inter-dealer markets have become established for some fixed income securities, which are sufficiently uniform, such as government bonds. These securities have tended to be the ones that have most successfully migrated to electronic trading, although the overall level of adoption still lags many of the other asset classes.

# **Asset specific**

A fixed-income asset represents a debt for a specific amount (the principal), whereby the issuer is obliged to repay the holder at some future date (the maturity date). Debt can be issued by governments, other agencies and by companies. A variety of names are used for these, for example, the U.S. Treasury terms them based on their maturity, namely bills (<1 year), notes  $(2-10 \text{ years})$  and bonds  $(>10 \text{ years})$ . For simplicity, in this book all such debt will generally be referred to as bonds. Debt may also be issued based on pools of loans, which is the essence of asset-backed securities. Similarly, mortgage-backed securities are the equivalent for real estate debt.

The return for an investment in bonds is usually more predictable than for stocks, and is bounded by their principal value. Investors are typically looking for safer returns than the potential growth offered by equities. Therefore, some of the largest investors are pension funds and insurance companies. Since these firms often adopt buy-and-hold strategies, the liquidity of bonds traded in the secondary markets can be much less than for stocks.

The issuer of a bond will usually pay interest (the coupon) to the holder at a given frequency for the lifetime of the loan, e.g. every 6 months. Alternatively, zero coupon bonds make no such payments; instead, their price is discounted by an equivalent amount. Either way, at maturity the bond should redeem its principal amount, or face value. Hence, the main risk with bonds is that the issuer defaults on the debt. This risk is generally reflected by the bond's interest rate, so riskier debt pays higher coupons to compensate investors. The bond's price will also reflect this, so higher risk bonds usually trade at a much deeper discount than others.

The effective interest rate that a bond issuer must pay depends on the maturity date of the contract, as well as their credit rating and the current market rates. Bonds will sometimes have additional collateralization or credit protection to reduce the credit risk, allowing issuers to use slightly lower rates. For secured bonds, specific assets (collateral) have been pledged which may be sold to ensure the debt holders are paid in case of bankruptcy. Debts may also be differentiated in terms of their seniority when it comes to bankruptcy hearings, with senior debt taking priority over subordinated debt. All these specifics should be detailed in the bond's indenture, which formally specifies the rights of bondholders. It also contains details of any covenants that may relate to the finances of the issuer, e.g. pledging to maintain specific capital requirements, or even restricting the levels of dividends. Often such covenants are intended to protect the income stream for bondholders, so again they can affect the coupon rate.

Bonds may also have a range of conditions associated with their maturity date. Extendable bonds allow the issuer to extend the maturity date, for instance, when the market rates become unfavourable. Callable bonds allow the issuer to redeem the bond before it matures. Thus, to compensate the bondholders for such provisions the issuer must pay a premium. On the other hand, some bonds incorporate an option that allows the bondholder to force redemption on specific dates, for which they must in turn pay a premium.

#### **Pricing and trading**

In general, bonds are more straightforward to price than equities. Essentially, the fair price of a bond is the present value of all its future interest and principal payments. The present value incorporates a discount for the market rate of return, which in turn depends on the bond's characteristics. So for a government bond issued in the local currency with negligible default risk the market rate should approximate to the risk-free rate. For higher risk issuers, the rate will need to be higher. Macroeconomic factors, such as inflation expectations, will also have a considerable impact on the price of bonds.

The main risk with bonds is that the issuer defaults on the debt. This is reflected in both their interest rate and price, so riskier bonds usually trade at a deeper discount than others.

Bonds are priced in terms of a percentage of their par value, where 100 represents 100% of the face value. They can also trade at a premium where the price will be above 100, for instance, when the bond's coupon is more attractive than the prevailing market rates. Bonds are still quoted in fractions for many markets, so 95:05, 95-05 or 95'05 are not the same as 95.05. Some bonds quote in eighths, whilst U.S. treasuries are quoted in 1/32<sup>nd</sup>s, so 95-05 is actually 95  $\frac{5}{32}$  = 95.15625, whilst 95-05+ adds another 1/64 so it is 95.171875. Hopefully, decimalisation will continue to spread.

Another factor that can affect bond prices is related to the interest that has been accrued since the last coupon payment, which must also be transferred when the bond is traded. Some markets include this interest in the bond's current price, also referred to as a "dirty price", whilst others exclude it - instead adopting a "clean price".

A bond's yield to maturity (YTM) represents the annualised rate of return it would give if held to maturity. This is inversely related to the bond price, so the higher the price the lower the YTM and vice versa. So, when market interest rates rise, bond prices should fall. In fact, bonds are often referred to by their yield, rather than their price.

Unlike stocks, a single issuer can have a huge range of bonds, each differing in terms of when they were issued and their maturity, their interest rate and payment structure, any collateralization/credit-protection as well as the specifics of the indenture. Indeed, the number of different bonds is phenomenal. For example, in the U.S alone there are more than three million bonds, that is two hundred times more than the number of equities available globally. This diversity can pose serious liquidity problems, since for many assets it will be difficult to find sufficient depth in a given bond for a continuous market. Only the markets

for reasonably standardised debt, such as U.S. Treasuries, tend to have sufficient volume to be viable for continuous trading. One factor that helps is the fact that many bond investors trade based on specifications, such as credit rating and maturity, rather than seeking a specific bond. This provides more liquidity to a market that would otherwise be much sparser.

Liquidity for bonds can often differ significantly over their lifetime. For instance, most of the activity is focussed on the current issue of a bond (when it is "on the run"). As soon as the next issue is released, the trading volume of the previous (now "off the run") asset plummets. In fact, a study by Michael Barclay, Terrence Hendershott, and Kenneth Kotz (2006) found that "off the run" U.S. treasuries fall to around 10% of their former volume. The prevalence of "buy and hold" strategies, particularly for corporate bonds, means that shortly after issuance, many bonds are simply not available for trading.

Bonds tend to trade in much larger size than stocks, but often with much lower frequencies. For example, a report by the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) (2005) notes that the average trade size for gilts was £5 million compared with only £43,000 for U.K. equities, in 2004. Whilst even the most heavily traded issue in the gilt market only saw around 200 trades in a day, whereas for stocks this figure is at least an order of magnitude more.

Corporate debt is even less heavily traded. A study of U.S. corporate bonds by Amy Edwards, Lawrence Harris and Michael Piwowar (2007) found that, on average, bonds traded less than 1.9 times a day, with more than  $60\%$  of the trades worth less than \$100,000. Similarly, a European study by Bruno Biais *et al.* (2006) found an average of 3.07 trades per day for euro denominated corporate bonds and only 2.23 for U.K. sterling ones, with a maximum number of trades no more than 50 a day. Bonds with lower associated credit ratings tend to trade less regularly, although the trends for maturity date were less conclusive with Biais et al. (2006) noting that short and long-term debt seemed to be the most heavily traded.

# World fixed income markets

Globally there is over \$85 trillion of outstanding fixed income debt. This is based on data for the total outstanding domestic and international debt in H1 2008, from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) (2008). Government debt accounts for around \$30.7 trillion  $(36\%)$  of this. A further \$45.5 trillion is owed by financial agencies  $(53\%)$  whilst the remaining \$9 trillion is from corporate debt. Much of this debt is actually concentrated in a handful of countries, as Figure B-1 shows. Overall, the Americas account for 42%, followed by 40% for the EMEA region and 18% for Asia.

Bond markets differ based on the type of debt. Government bond markets tend to issue more standardised contracts, whereas corporate debt is often more customised. Hence, the government debt markets tend to be larger and more liquid. The governments also have much more control over how these markets are structured and run.

The secondary markets for most of the world's bonds are dealer-based and much of the trading is still done over-the-counter (OTC). The markets are segmented between interdealer and dealer-to-client trading. The lack of centralised markets, or exchanges, means that for clients most trading is principal.

# American fixed income markets

The U.S. dominates the world's fixed income marketplace, as is clear from Figure B-1. Though, Canada and Latin America also have significant debt markets.

## **U.S. fixed income market**

The U.S. fixed income market is huge; it caters for a debt of around \$25 trillion, together with a daily trading volume of more than a trillion dollars. Over half of this daily volume consists of government debt trading. Though, as Table B-1 shows, much of the U.S. outstanding debt is actually issued by other agencies, municipalities and corporations.

## Table B-1 U.S. fixed income market <sup>10</sup>

U.S. treasuries are the most liquid fixed income assets, accounting for nearly two thirds of the daily volume, which is not that surprising given the demand for treasury debt and the amount available. This liquidity is, in part, due to the essentially risk-free nature of the issuer. It is also helped by the relative standardisation, in terms of the characteristics of each bond issue. The benchmark asset for U.S. Treasury debt is the 10-year note. In fact, these are often used as an indicator for long-term interest rates. Although in 2006 the Treasury also

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>10</sup> Money market and asset-backed debt is worth around \$7 billion, based on estimates from SIFMA (2008a).

reintroduced quarterly issues of its 30-year bond. About 70% of the trading volume is solely attributable to the currently on-the-run assets. So most trading activity is concentrated on this small subset, as Frank Fabozzi and Michael Fleming (2004) note, despite the wide range of bonds that are available.

In comparison, agency and municipal debt is much less heavily traded. To compensate for the slightly greater credit risk they offer tax benefits, so they are generally held by single investors, insurance companies or trusts (hence their low daily turnover).

Likewise, the turnover for U.S. corporate debt is negligible, considering the size of the outstanding debt. As we can see in Table B-1 it accounts for around 2% of the average daily volume. In fact, the corporate debt market turns over only about once a year. <sup>11</sup> In comparison, treasuries turn over thirty times a year, as Harrell Smith (2005) points out. This lack of liquidity is partly due to the fact that much corporate debt is held to maturity.

Although there have been no massive structural changes in the U.S. fixed income marketplace, at the height of the dot.com bubble there were over a hundred vendors offering electronic trading platforms. Intense competition and rationalisation has whittled this down to a more realistic marketplace. A report by the Celent (2008a) consultancy estimates that electronic trading accounts for 57% of the U.S. fixed income market's average daily volume. They predict that this should reach 62% by 2010. The highly liquid U.S. Treasuries lead the way with nearly 80% of the volume traded electronically. They found much lower levels for the other classes. For instance, only 32% of mortgage-based security trading was electronic.

The inter-dealer broker market for U.S. Treasuries is dominated by a few brokers. These have effectively taken the place of bond exchanges, as Larry Tabb (2004) notes. Electronic trading accounts most of the trading in on-the-run treasuries; even the off-the-run market has around 50% electronic trading. The market share is split between ICAP's BrokerTec (58%) and BGC's eSpeed (41%) platforms, given estimates from ICAP (2007). Both systems allow anonymous order matching, so the market place for 2, 5 or 10-year treasury notes is much like the equity markets. BrokerTec also supports "workups", allowing dealers to negotiate the trade quantity. In terms of volume, ICAP (2009) reported average daily trading figures of \$141 billion for U.S. Treasuries in 2008 (note this also includes T-bills), ICAP also has a major presence in the electronic inter-dealer market for mortgage-backed securities. BrokerTec supports agency and corporate debt trading as well. For municipals, the MuniCenter provides a similar inter-dealer platform, which also competes for agency and corporate debt.

In the dealer-to-client marketplace there is a lot less liquidity. Tradeweb is the market leader in offering electronic access, via a request-for-quote mechanism, with average daily volumes of around \$300 billion in 2008, based on figures from the company. It caters for trading government, agency, mortgage-backed and corporate debt, as well as money market, credit and derivatives. Bloomberg's BondTrader provides a similar service. In terms of corporate debt, MarketAxess leads the market for electronic trading, with its multi-dealer RFQ based platform. Further competition in the dealer-to-client market should have arrived in the form of LiquidityHub, which was to provide clients with a request-for-stream based trading mechanism for government bonds, aggregating the liquidity from a consortium of over a dozen banks. Unfortunately, the 2007-09 financial crisis helped put an end to this venture.

The U.S. is seeing a gradual shift in market structure. Investment firms/hedge funds have started to become an important part of the inter-dealer market. A paper by the European

 $^{11}$  This is when the cumulative traded volume equals the level of outstanding debt.

Primary Dealers Association (EPDA) (2007) notes that these were reported to account for five of the top ten participants on BrokerTec and three of the top ten on eSpeed. A thriving arbitrage business has developed between the two systems and the futures market, as reported in an article by Daniel Safarik (2005). In this article, the CEO of electronic brokerage at ICAP, David Rutter, explains that much of this is due to a small number of quantitative trading firms laying off risk against bond-based futures contracts from the CBOT. Interestingly, he also highlighted that algorithmic trading was their fastest growing customer segment, with more than half of the bids and offers from computerised systems. The advent of such trading has also helped to reduce price discrepancies and become an important source of liquidity.

Exchange based trading was rekindled in 2007 with NYSE re-launching its bonds trading platform. This is based on the electronic order book from its Arca platform; trading is anonymous and both limit and reserve/iceberg style orders are supported. In addition to the main trading segment, there is also an early trading session from 4am, and a late session lasting until 8pm. It currently caters for over 3,000 bonds, although ultimately this figure should double. It will be interesting to see how much market share this captures, and how it affects the overall market in the long term.

"Dark pools" have not quite spread to the U.S. fixed income market. That said, State Street Global Markets FICross is a pretty close approximation. A nice summary of FICross is provided by Cristina McEachern (2008). Effectively, it offers a bulletin board where users can post anonymous orders or indications of interest. Matching is still done manually with State Street acting as the intermediary, although they are also planning to offer an automated process. At present, the coverage is for cash bonds with most of the activity in corporate and asset-backed instruments.

Post-trade transparency has also been improved for the corporate debt market by the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) initiative, first approved by the SEC in 2001. This mandated reporting of trade prices for all dealers and brokers, and does seem to have helped reduce overall costs. A study by Michael Goldstein, Edith Hotchkiss and Eric Sirri  $(2007)$  found that the increased transparency had a neutral or positive effect on market liquidity, based on measurements of trading volume and effective spreads. Though, some market participants still feel that overall liquidity has declined since the introduction of TRACE.

#### <table> Table B-2 Outstanding debt for other American debt markets

The Canadian debt market has started to attract more interest, particularly from U.S. investors. Though, trading levels are still relatively low compared to the U.S. Overall, the Investment Industry Association of Canada (IIAC) (2008) reported that \$7 trillion was traded in 2007. The turnover ratio for government debt is around 6.8, versus over 30 for the U.S. The Canadian corporate debt market is also tiny compared to the U.S., with only around \$250 billion in outstanding debt. In terms of electronic trading, a consolidated view of the market is provided by CanPX, which has merged quotes from inter-dealer brokers since 1999. In the dealer-to-client space, CanDeal and Bloomberg's Bondtrader were launched in 2002; both provide RFQ trading for institutional clients. There is also an alternative execution venue run by Collective Bid (CBID) Markets Inc. CBID offers an anonymous electronic order book for both dealers and clients, although it also provides an RFQ mechanism for less liquid bonds.

Brazil has a substantial debt market, most of which is for government debt, since its corporate market is relatively undeveloped. However, the trading volumes are relatively low; in 2005, the annual turnover for government bonds was \$433 billion, based on a BIS (2006) report. In fact, based on the turnover ratio it appears to be even less liquid than the U.S. corporate debt market. It will be interesting to see how much impact the setup of MTS Brazil has. which is due to create a dedicated electronic platform for Brazilian sovereign debt.

Mexico is the next largest source of debt in Latin America, although it is around half the size of the Brazilian market. Government securities are quite heavily traded, the BIS (2006) report found that annual turnover was more than five times the outstanding notional value in 2005.

## EMEA fixed income markets

The introduction of the Euro currency in 1999 helped create the second largest debt market in the world. The main Euro-zone countries are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Their combined outstanding domestic debt is worth over \$14 trillion, based on figures from BIS (2008). Another \$1.4 trillion comes from the U.K., together with \$1.4 trillion for Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland combined.

Despite this sizeable debt, the trading volumes are much lower than the U.S. The average daily volume for the Euro-zone secondary government debt market is around \$90 billion ( $\text{\textcircled{\small 65}}$  billion), according to BearingPoint (2007), as compared to around \$500 billion for U.S. treasury. In part, this is due to the fact that the Euro-zone represents a diverse range of issuers, so the market is much more fragmented. Most of the trading, around 70%, is concentrated on German, French and Italian government debt. The largest of these is the German bond market with around €20 billion traded daily.

The inter-dealer market accounts for around half of the Euro-zone government bond trading volume. Of this, BearingPoint (2007) estimate that around  $50\%$  is handled by electronic platforms whilst the remainder is voice brokered. An earlier study by Peter Dunne, Michael Moore and Richard Portes (2006) puts this at closer to two thirds for electronic trading. The electronic trading marketplace is dominated by the MTS platform, which has around an 80% market share. The remainder is split mainly between Greece's HDAT (15%), Eurex Bonds (4%) and Spain's SENAF (1%), based on the BearingPoint (2007) survey.

Originally, the MTS (Mercato Telematico dei Titoli di Stato) was created in 1988 to improve the secondary market for Italian government bonds. Since the late '90s it has expanded across the Euro-zone with separate national markets. EuroMTS was launched in

1999 to cater for benchmark government bonds and other high quality debt from Euro-zone countries. MTS aggregates market maker's firm two-way prices and provides anonymous trading. By 2004, it had reached an average daily volume of around €25 billion, according to a report from the Bond Market Association (TBMA) (2005).

In terms of the other platforms, Greece's HDAT quote-driven trading system is based on the same technology as List Group's FastTrack-ATS. SENAF and Eurex Bonds both provide anonymous electronic order books. All of these systems predominantly cater for local debt, although Eurex Bonds has started to move beyond Germany to cover Euro-zone benchmark government and corporate debt as well. The UK Gilt market adopts a hybrid trading environment that incorporates anonymous quote-driven trading, although it is somewhat less liquid than the Euro-zone. Unlike in the U.S., ICAP's BrokerTec and BGC's eSpeed have found it harder to gain a sizeable market share in Europe. As Avinash Persaud (2006) explains, primary dealerships have often been awarded based on trading on local platforms, usually MTS, so there has been less incentive for dealers to use alternatives such as BrokerTec or eSpeed. That said, things have started to improve, for example, Austrian, Belgian and Dutch state treasury agencies have now formally recognised BGC's European Government Platform.

For the dealer-to-client marketplace, BearingPoint (2007) estimate that around 40% is handled electronically. They also report that Tradeweb is the market leader with 52% market share, followed by MTS's BondVision (25%) and Bloomberg's BondTrader (21%) multidealer system. Other systems, such as Reuters RTFI trading system only account for around 2%. These proportions have not changed significantly since the 2004 report from TBMA (2005) when Tradeweb had an average daily volume of  $\in$ 8 billion, compared to  $\in$ 3 billion for both BondVision and BondTrader. MarketAxess also offers its multi-dealer platform for European corporate debt. Again, all of these systems are generally based on request-forquote trading mechanisms.

Europe is also starting to see some changes in the overall market structure. The MTS Group is considering providing access for hedge funds. Eurex Bonds has also been looking to incorporate a wider range of investment firms and hedge funds.

## Asian fixed income markets

The financial crisis that spread throughout Asia in 1997-98 highlighted the need for a welldeveloped domestic bond market. Before this, banks and corporations had relied on foreign currency based funding, taking advantage of low overseas interest rates. When market perceptions changed in 1997, this loan market dried up and so intensified the crisis, as Atsushi Takeuchi (2005) points out. Some ten years later, the Asian bond market has now grown to nearly the same size as Europe, in terms of outstanding domestic debt. Japan still accounts for the majority (66%) of this, followed by China (14%), South Korea (7%) and Australia  $(5\%)$ , based on data from BIS  $(2008)$ .

Japan has the largest outstanding government debt in the world, at around \$7.8 trillion, hased on H1 2008 data from BIS (2008). In comparison, its corporate debt is unusually low, at less than \$0.7 trillion, or around 7% of the government debt. Average daily volumes are lower than in the U.S. Figures from Asian Bonds Online (2007) put the ADV for Japanese government bonds at around \$150 billion, whilst corporate debt trades less than \$2 billion.

Despite its size, the market for Japanese government debt, or JGBs, has been slow to embrace electronic trading. The inter-dealer market for JGBs is led by Japan Bond Trading; the brokerages ICAP Totan Securities and BGC Securities also have a considerable presence. Some trading is also carried out on the Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya stock exchanges. Electronic trading is steadily increasing, based on Celent's (2006a) figures it should increase to nearly 60% by 2009 from around 35% in 2005. Japan Bond Trading has around a 60% market share, based on data from an article in the International Herald Tribune (IHT) (2006). It provides both a FIX interface as well as BB Super Trade, an order-driven platform initially created for trading short-term government bills (TB and FB), outlined in more detail by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) (2001) Market Review. It has also formed an alliance with Instinct. Electronic trading is also catered for by ICAP's ETC and BGC's eSpeed platforms. Though, MTS-Japan closed in 2003 after struggling to cope with an initially dormant market, which then became extremely volatile. Unlike in Europe the market makers did not have the benefit of being primary dealers, as noted by Tomohiko Taniguchi (2003), so the cost of providing liquidity in such a market was simply too high. For the dealer-to-client (D2C) market, trading is still generally handled by phone. The small electronic market, barely 2% in 2005, consists of multi-dealer platforms, such as Yensai.com, JBond and Bloomberg's Tradebook, and single broker systems. The Celent (2006a) consultancy estimates that electronic D2C trading may increase to nearly 13% by 2009.

China has the next largest government debt to Japan, with \$0.9 trillion outstanding, based on data from the Asia development bank's Asia Bond Monitor (ABM) (2007). Government debt markets in Hong Kong and China have an average daily volume of over \$4 billion each. Corporate debt in China accounts for nearly \$0.5 trillion. This is a significant increase due to growing numbers of Chinese corporations being allowed to directly issue their own bonds. Average daily volumes for corporate debt are around \$1.3 billion. Secondary trading for all types of bonds takes place mainly on the quote-driven inter-bank bond market and the order books of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. The MTS group have also signed a letter of intent with the China Foreign Exchange Trade System to cooperate with the development of an MTS-like market for government debt.

South Korea has less than \$0.5 trillion each of outstanding government and corporate debt. The government debt market is more liquid with daily market volume of nearly \$5 billion versus only \$1 billion for corporate debt. Around 95% of the total bond trading in on the OTC market, again based on figures from Asian Bonds Online (2007a). The remainder is traded on the Korean Exchange's dedicated bond platform, which will also form the basis for Malaysia's new platform.

## Summary

- Electronic trading is becoming more widespread for fixed income assets, particularly  $\blacksquare$ for the more liquid government bonds in the U.S. and Europe.
- The most scope for algorithmic trading is currently in the inter-dealer markets, which  $\mathbb{R}$ are often based on hybrid electronic order books. Though, it is also possible using the RFO and RFS platforms commonly provided in the dealer-to-client markets.
- It will take some time before the adoption of electronic and algorithmic trading щ reaches that of equities, but the size of this market means it is a significant opportunity.
