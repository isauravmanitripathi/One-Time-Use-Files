# $Appendix D$ **Money markets**

The money markets are key to the provision of short-term financing for banks, institutions and corporations. Often this is for short periods of time, from overnight to around a month, although it can be for as much as a year.

In the following sub-sections, we will review the markets for unsecured short-term debt, repurchase agreements and stock lending. In Appendix E, we shall also touch on some of the key money market derivatives, such as overnight interest rate swaps. Note that a more detailed overview of the U.S. money markets is provided in Chapter 4 of the New York Fed's (1998) book 'U.S. Monetary Policy and Financial Markets'.

# Short-term debt

Short-term debts encompass a variety of assets, from traditional fixed income contracts to tradable loans/deposits and commercial paper. There is a considerable market for such debt, although it is often handled as part of the fixed income or FX markets.

# Asset specific

Generally, the lifetime for short-term debt is less than a year, and is often anything from overnight to a month. Hence, the risk of default is lower than their longer-term counterparts.

Government bonds provide a comparatively risk-free investment, particularly over the short-term. Usually, short-term issues are traded at a discount, rather than paying coupons. The best-known example is U.S. Treasury bills. Their European counterparts are Germany's Bubills, France's BTF bills, Italy's BOT bills and the Dutch DTC bills. Short-term government agency and municipal debt is also available, such as federal agency discount notes. Other than their shorter lifespan, none of these instruments is that different from the fixed income assets that we saw in Appendix  $B$ .

Inter-bank lending is an important source of short-term liquidity for banks, particularly overnight, for banks. Both U.S. federal funds and Eurodollars are sources of immediately available funds for banks, and through them large financial institutions. U.S. federal funds refer to depository accounts held with the Federal Reserve. Banks that have excess liquidity can loan it out to those that may need additional overnight cover. The rate at which these deals occur is based on the federal funds rate. Eurodollar deposits represent dollar accounts held in banks outside of the U.S. The London Interbank Offer Rates (LIBOR) are the rates at which highly rated banks may borrow Eurodollar deposits, from overnight to three or six months.

Deposits usually pay slightly higher interest than government bills, since there is more credit risk. Their rate is also obviously linked to the set term period. A time (or term) deposit represents money that may not be withdrawn from an account for a set amount of time. Negotiable deposits may be traded in the secondary markets, whilst non-negotiable ones are held to maturity. Large time deposits are classified in the U.S. as those with a value greater than \$100,000. A certificate of deposit (CD) is just a type of time deposit, where all the details used to be printed on a certificate.

A banker's acceptance is a money draft to pay a set amount on a certain date. Once accepted by a bank they become liable for the amount, in turn they may then choose to trade it on the secondary markets.

Commercial paper (CP) provides an alternative to bank loans for corporations. Effectively, these are unsecured promissory notes, often issued at a discount. Due to the credit risk, these obviously pay higher rates than government bills. Still, these are often lower than the corporation could achieve funding via a bank; hence their appeal to both firms and investors. In the U.S., commercial paper generally has a maturity date of less than 270 days since this is the limit before registration with the SEC is required.

Unlike the previous instruments, asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) represents a secured loan. Generally, these are issued against a special purpose vehicle (SPV) company, which was setup specifically to provide these secured loans.

#### Global short-term debt markets

The world's money markets are sizeable. For the U.S. alone, they account for around \$5.5 trillion of outstanding notional value, as shown in Table D-1.

#### Table D-1 U.S. money market

Short-term government debt is an important and highly liquid segment of the money market. In the U.S., Treasury Bills are issued weekly for periods of 4, 13 and 26 weeks. Although off-the-run bills suffer a significant fall in trading volume, the weekly issuance ensures this is still a highly liquid market. For 2008, the U.S. primary dealers association reported average daily trading volumes of around \$77 billion, according to the New York Fed (2009). The U.S. electronic inter-dealer market mainly consists of ICAP's BrokerTec and BGC's eSpeed platforms. In Europe, Germany's Bubills are important benchmarks for short-term government debt. There are inter-dealer markets for these on hoth MTS and Eurex Bonds. Other important European government bills are France's BTFs and Italy's BOTs, which are also tradable on Euro MTS. ICAP caters for trading of these key European benchmark bills as well.

Overnight unsecured lending for banks in the U.S. is provided by the Fed funds market.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>14</sup> Based on data from the U.S. Treasury, Federal Reserve System

ICAP's i-Feds platform provides a multi-dealer venue where live prices are posted for the overnight Fed funds market. They estimate that over 40% of the total market is represented by the providers using i-Feds, with over a thousand registered lenders and over 130 active sellers. In Europe, e-MID has offered electronic trading for inter-bank deposits since 1990, starting with the Lira then moving on to cater for the Euro, U.K. sterling and U.S. dollar. In 2007, e-MID saw average daily volumes of over €30 billion, but the 2007-09 financial crisis led to a considerable decline in turnover for deposits, so by Q2 2008 this had fallen to around €15 billion, based on data from the ECB (2009) review. Across Europe, the ECB estimate that 17% of such unsecured trading is electronic.

Corporate short-term debt, in the form of commercial paper, was also significantly affected by fallout from the financial crisis. This hit the U.S. asset backed commercial paper (ABCP) segment particularly hard. In fact, from its high of nearly \$1.2 trillion outstanding in 2007, U.S. ABCP has since fallen to \$758 billion in H1 2008, based on figures from SIFMA (2008a). Unsecured commercial paper accounts for nearly another trillion dollars, with \$817 billion from financial institutions and \$165 billion from non-financial firms. The European market for ABCP has seen a similar decline to around €70 billion outstanding (from €175 billion) based on data from the ECB (2009) review. In terms of electronic trading, there is some but commercial paper is still predominantly traded OTC via the phone.

The dealer-to-client marketplace for money market assets is catered for by a range of offerings, including those from the major fixed income and foreign exchange markets as well as dedicated platforms.

For instance, Tradeweb not only caters for short-term government debt, but also provides trading for U.S. agency notes, CDs and both U.S. and European commercial paper. Bloomberg offers similar trading via its BondTrader and Money Markets platforms. These both offer firm dealer quotes as well as a request-for-quote (RFQ) mechanism. In Canada, CanDeal provides a multi-dealer to client RFQ platform for trading Canadian Treasury bills and money market assets. Whilst in Europe, MTS's BondVision provides trading for shortterm government debt.

Many of the foreign exchange platforms have also expanded to incorporate money market trading. FXAll provides trading of cash loans and deposits via its multi-dealer quote-driven mechanism, which also allows electronic negotiation. Similarly, Currenex have extended their multi-dealer platform to enable trading of loans and deposits. Whilst the 360t platform not only caters for deposits but also allows trading of commercial paper and forward rate agreements (FRAs), which are effectively money market derivatives.

There are dedicated offerings as well, such as the SunGard Transaction Network (STN) Money Markets service. This helps connect institutional investors and corporate treasurers, allowing them to trade CDs and commercial paper directly with the issuers. Brokers have also extended their single dealer-to-client platforms to cater for the money markets. Noteworthy examples are Deutsche Bank's Autobahn and Barclays' BARX platforms, which support both request-for-streaming (RFS) prices and RFQ trading.

# Repos

Repos reflect both the money markets and the bond markets. Their short terms place them in the category of money market assets, but since the underlying collateral is often a bond they are also affected by the same factors which influence bonds.

#### Asset specific

A repo is the common name for a sale and repurchase agreement, essentially this is a secured loan. The seller provides securities in return for cash, but they also commit to repurchase them back at a specified date for a set price together with an interest payment. The interest paid is based on a pre-negotiated repo rate, which will often be offset from a benchmark, such as the Fed funds rate. A reverse-repo transaction is simply the opposite of a repo. A sell/buy back is similar to a repo, although the sale and repurchase are simultaneous. This is because the repurchase is achieved with a forward transaction. The repo rate is implied in this forward price. A more detailed introduction to repos is provided by Moorad Choudhry  $(2006).$ 

Specific repos are for a certain security. In the U.S., these are often termed special collateral repos or "specials". In comparison, general collateral (GC) repos allow the security to be fungible so any acceptable security that meets the set requirements may be used. The difference between the general collateral repo rate and the specials rate reflects the demand to borrow the specific security. Although repos have traditionally been used for bonds, the market for equity repos is steadily growing.

During the term of the repo, the legal title to the securities is transferred. Though, the repo seller remains exposed to the risk of owning them, since they have committed to repurchasing them at a set price. Therefore, if the market value of the collateral securities drops they will suffer a loss. In comparison, the repo buyer remains unaffected.

Repos have become extremely important for central banks as a means of implementing their monetary policies. They trade repos with the primary dealers to inject reserve balances into the banking system, whilst reverse-repos allow them to reduce the available balances. Thus, they enable them to control the overall liquidity. They also allow both dealers and investment firms to finance their positions at lower interest costs.

The standardisation of repos, using the International Capital Market Association's (ICMA) Global Master Repurchase Agreement, makes them well suited for electronic trading. Triparty repos are also becoming increasingly popular. These involve a third party clearing bank with which both parties must have cash and collateral accounts. Essentially, this acts like a central counterparty (CCP) allowing for anonymous trading, as opposed to the more bilateral delivery versus payment settlement.

#### Global repo markets

The global repo market accounts for a daily notional outstanding value over \$16 trillion, most of which is split between the U.S. and Europe. Over \$6.5 trillion of this involves U.S. government financing with the primary dealers, based on Q3 2008 figures from the Federal Reserve (2009). The European repo market accounts for around another \$8.1 trillion, or  $\text{\textless{6.4}}$ trillion, based on a market review by Celent (2007). The European market has more than trebled in size since 2001, although in the last few years its size has stabilised. In Asia, repo levels are lower; for instance, Japan's market is worth around \$1 trillion, according to a report from the Nomura Research Institute (NRI) (2007).

Adoption of electronic trading is growing. In Europe, the ECB (2009) survey found that 48% of trading was carried out electronically. A similar value was reported in the Celent (2007) analysis. The Bearing Point (2007a) consultancy predicts that by 2012 over 75% of trades should be electronic, accounting for a third of the total volume. Automation is also starting to be applied to OTC repo trading via trade matching and confirmation systems, such as ETCMS and Trax II.

The wholesale inter-dealer repo market in the U.S. focuses on overnight repos. ICAP supports trading over their electronic BrokerTec platform, as well as via voice. They allow trading for any institutions that are netting members of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC). BrokerTec automates the process for general collateral deals, allowing traders to easily change the assigned security. In 2008, they achieved average daily volumes of around \$195 billion, based on data from ICAP (2009). Tullett Prebon's TradeBlade, also offers anonymous matching for bids and offers from any netting member of FICC, BGC's eSpeed platform is available for repos as well, for the 18 U.S. primary dealers who trade with the Federal Reserve BNY. Longer-term repos tend to be handled more by voice brokers.

The European inter-dealer market is also led by ICAP followed by Eurex Repo and MTS. ICAP Europe trades repos for European government securities, UK Gilts, Euro Supra National Agencies and Sovereigns, as well as covered bonds, corporate bonds and U.S. treasuries. In terms of volume, ICAP (2009) reported average daily figures of \$259 billion for European repos in 2008. Eurex Repos caters for repos on European and German government securities as well as other bonds. It has also introduced GC Pooling, allowing a much wider range of European Central Bank (ECB)-eligible collateral. MTS's Money Market Facility is a dedicated MTS segment for repos and buy/sell backs, which was established in 1997. MTS focuses on repos for European government securities, Italian bonds and German covered bonds. There is also an important local market for repos on Spanish bonds traded via SENAF. Note that a further complication for European repo trading is the multitude of clearing and settlement venues, whereas the U.S. has a central clearing counterparty.

In Japan, repo trading has been mainly voice based. Though, Japan Bond Trading Co. has announced that it will introduce an electronic marketplace for repos.

In the dealer-to-client markets, voice trading is still the norm, although there are some electronic alternatives. Tradeweb provides an electronic trading platform for triparty repo with average daily volumes in excess of \$175 billion, based on their own figures (Tradeweb (2008)). Bloomberg has a repo offering as well; there are also single broker solutions, such as Morgan Stanley's RepoLink. The European dealer-to-client market is much smaller.

# Securities lending

Securities (or stock) lending is like a repo without the loan; the securities are simply lent for a fee. Over the last few years, the securities lending business has seen a considerable level of growth as hedge funds have increasingly needed to borrow securities to support their short positions. However, the 2007-09 financial crisis had a considerable effect, particularly with governments introducing regulations to restrict short selling for certain sectors.

As with repos, the type of lending may be classified into general and specific. General lending is equivalent to a repo with general collateral so the security just needs to match a set of criteria. Again, the fees for lending depend on the scarcity of the security, so general lending costs significantly less.

# Global securities lending markets

The global securities lending market is sizable and steadily growing. A report by the Celent (2007a) consultancy notes that around \$3.6 trillion worth of assets are involved in lending, from an available total of about \$16 trillion. The U.S. accounts for around \$2.7 trillion, whilst Europe is around \$900 billion. By 2009, Celent estimate that the U.S. market may reach \$2.9 trillion, and Europe \$1 trillion.

At present, securities lending is still very much a relationship driven marketplace, with most of the trading being phone based. However, Celent (2007a) note that 10-15% of deals were traded over electronic platforms. They expect this to increase to around  $20\%$  in 2009.

The earliest electronic trading platforms for lending offered either bilateral order routing or auction-based trading mechanisms. As its name suggests, SunGard's Loanet Centralized Order Routing system provides a network dedicated to handling equity lending. It was launched in 1999 and by 2006 was processing over 100,000 borrow requests a day. Indeed, SunGard (2006) reported handling 22 million requests in 2005, worth \$6 trillion. Another notable platform is EquiLend; launched in 2002 by a consortium of ten large financial institutions it offers several types of trading services. Their AutoBorrow mechanism allows borrowers to review the available securities. Borrowers may direct orders to their lending counterparty, any successful executions are then returned to proprietary settlement systems. This bilateral mechanism also supports electronic negotiation through a service called Trade<sub>2</sub>O, which allows lenders and borrowers to upload specific positions or whole portfolios. It is targeted at the non-GC market in global equity and fixed income securities. EquiLend also allows lenders to run their own open or blind auctions via AuctionPort, to which the lender may invite specific bidders. In 2007, annual transaction volumes reached \$2.9 trillion for equity lending and \$277 billion for fixed income securities, based on data from EquiLend (2008). As of October 2008, they were executing up to 20,000 trades a day. Other noteworthy platforms offering a purely auction driven approach are eSecLending and BNY Mellon's I-Bid.

Centralised order-driven markets are also starting to appear for securities lending, notably SecFinex, Eurex's SecLend and ICAP's I-Sec. SecFinex was established in 2000, and now is part of NYSE Euronext. It caters for lending in U.S., European and Japanese equities; providing an order driven market that supports pre-trade anonymity and credit checking, whilst a separate service allows entire portfolios to be auctioned. SecFinex also offers a private market, based on a bilateral trading mechanism that supports negotiation. The private market provides a search mechanism allowing borrowers to check for the availability of a particular stock across their entire lender base. They were also the first system to make available executed trade information, helping to improve the post-trade transparency for this market. Eurex's SecLend has been around since 2005, enabling electronic lending for fixed income or equities. Around \$150 billion worth of assets are available for lending in SecLend. In 2007, ICAP's I-Sec was launched, based on their BrokerTec platform. It supports an anonymous order driven market for equity lending in similar markets to SecFinex, also providing an anonymous bilateral negotiation mechanism.

#### Summary

- Electronic trading is increasingly available for the money markets, often based on platforms also used for fixed income or foreign exchange.
- Short-term debt seems the most likely candidate for algorithmic trading, although cross-asset trading strategies may well start to incorporate repos and securities lending as well.
