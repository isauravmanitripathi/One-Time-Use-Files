## The Birth of a Trader

▼t was 1989, and I was California dreamin'. Actually I wasn't dreaming, I was al- $\perp$ ready in California, living a young single man's dream. A year or so out of college, I was residing in sunny Manhattan Beach, California, with a small apartment three blocks from the soft white sand so wonderful that they used it to help create Waikiki Beach in Hawaii. I had graduated the year before, summa cum laude, with a bachelor's degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Michigan, a top-tier engineering school. Then I had turned my back on Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech), Stanford University, Purdue University, and Michigan, all of whom had accepted me in their aerospace master's degree program. I turned down those great schools to live and work in sunny California, a lifelong dream.

I still remember the precise moment I made that fateful decision. On a bitterly cold winter's day in Ann Arbor, Michigan, I was walking down South University Avenue to one of my final-semester classes. The wind was blowing so hard in my face that I actually leaned into the wind to see if it would keep me up. At that point, falling face-first onto the ice-covered sidewalk would not have been much worse than feeling the stinging wind in my face. What seemed like a gale-force wind kept me upright, and then I knew—I did not want, or need, to live where it was cold in the winter when aerospace engineering graduates like me were flocking to jobs in sunny southern California. My mind was made up. Sun and sand it was.

A few weeks after graduation, I packed up my belongings, and with my sister Karen as my driving companion, drove cross-country to warm and sunny Los Angeles.

 One year later, I was settled in. I had a close group of friends, most of them Midwestern transplants like me. We'd while away the weekends playing beach volleyball, usually capping the day off with a few drinks at a local pub. I loved beach living and all the entertainment it provided. Driving around the beach cities in my little red T‐roof sports car, life was pretty good.

But something was missing.

 I couldn't put my fi nger on it, but I knew this wasn't the life for me. Well, beach life certainly agreed with me, but my choice of career was the wrong one. Sure, designing future fi ghter airplanes and working on secret government projects was fulfilling to a degree. But I just didn't feel like it was my future. I could not see myself doing that kind of work for even 5 years, much less a career of 30 or 40 years. I needed a jolt to wake me up. That jolt came in the form of junk mail that appeared in my mailbox one day, and it changed everything.

 The junk mail booklet was from Ken Roberts, a futures and commodities trader. Or at least that is how he presented himself. Looking back on it, he was defi nitely more of a salesman than a trader. With a nice, folksy smile and a cowboy hat, Ken laid out the riches that awaited anyone brave enough to trade futures, or commodities, as they were more commonly referred to back then.

 He had a compelling story in that little booklet of his, and I'll admit I was quickly hooked. Looking at a chart of sugar, as shown in Figure 1.1 , seeing all the potential profi t just waiting for me, how could I not be?

 At that point, words like *drawdown, risk of ruin,* and *emotional control* were not in my vocabulary. But *massive profi ts, easy money,* and *simple trading* suddenly were! And with a money‐back guarantee, how could I go wrong? It was a risk‐free entry pass into a world of unlimited profi t potential—or so my naive self‐thought. So I sent a check and dreamed that night about all the riches that would soon be fl owing my way.

 A few weeks later, I received the full trading course. It was a hefty manual, full of charts with profi table examples. Initially, I was duly impressed. But then I started to

![](_page_2_Figure_0.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 1.2** Good Head and Shoulders Pattern or Just a False Signal?

look a little closer at the details. Turns out the whole course was primarily based on the 1‐2‐3 head and shoulders pattern. As most traders and investors know, this pattern is a classic chart pattern, as shown in Figure 1.2 . It is easy to fi nd on just about any chart you look at—you can fi nd a profi table example or two on most any chart, any instrument, and any time frame.

 The problem is that the head and shoulders pattern gives a lot of false signals and usually looks good only in hindsight. Of course, I did not know that at fi rst. I only knew I could look at a chart, pick out the head and shoulders pattern, and see how well it worked.

 I eventually found out I was missing two key pieces of the puzzle. First, when you look at a chart with a head and shoulders or any other pattern in it, it is easy to see the winning trades because you are looking at both the pattern and the outcome of that pattern. If you try hiding the outcome of a pattern, it becomes much more diffi cult to fi nd the good patterns.

 The second key I was missing is that the existence of a pattern, by itself, doesn't necessarily mean a trade should be taken. If you take every single head and shoulders trade you see, you will soon be broke, as shown in Figure 1.3 . Of course, the naive wannabe trader in me was oblivious to this fact.

 After a month of dutifully following and paper trading all the head and shoulders signals, and fi nding most of them to be unprofi table, I sent all my trading records, along with the manual, back for a refund. True to his word, Mr. Roberts refunded my money.

 My dream of trading riches was shattered, at least temporarily. On the bright side, I now saw futures as the way to go—I just realized head and shoulders patterns were not going to be the way. Once I abandoned the get‐rich‐quick idea with the 1‐2‐3 head and shoulders patterns, I did what many scientifi c, numbers‐oriented people do: I looked to mathematical formulas to help me in my decision making. And I started where many people do: moving averages.

### ■ **My Moving Average Debacle**

 I'm sure every trader or investor has seen or used moving averages at some point in their trading career. Moving averages are a great way to see the general market direction, simplifying sometimes chaotic price action. But it comes at a price—lag. Moving averages will always lag whatever their calculation is based on, which can be a major problem.

 There are many ways to trade with moving averages. In the simplest method, you simply buy when the price is above the moving average, and sell (or sell short) when price is below the moving average. This scheme works very well during prolonged trends, but gets absolutely hammered during trading range price action (see Figure 1.4 ).

 Early market technician pioneers rectifi ed this by employing two, or even three, moving averages. By using more moving averages, the idea was to fi lter out some of the trading range whipsaw trades, and leave the long‐term, profi table trend trades.

 **FIGURE 1.5** Triple Moving Average Crossovers Can Be Deceiving

 After my unsuccessful foray into futures with chart patterns, I was struck by the apparent awesomeness and simplicity of the triple moving average. Looking at a chart, it was easy to see the profi table trades, while the unprofi table whipsaw trades were much harder to detect (see Figure 1.5 ). During the whipsaw periods, the moving average lines were very close together, and seeing crosses of lines was exceedingly diffi cult. Obviously, I had learned little from my head and shoulders experience, where what I saw on the chart was deceiving me.

 I quickly became a convert to the whole moving average concept, and after a few quick successful tests (I did not understand the need for testing over hundreds of trades at this point, so 10 or 20 trades, computed by hand, were good enough for me!), I decided to fund my fi rst account. Even though I had recently purchased a condo in expensive southern California, which took most of my savings, I was able to scrape together \$5,000 to open an account. Naturally, I was nervous beyond belief. This was my nest egg, at the mercy of moving averages. In retrospect, the insanity of this is obvious, but at the time profi ts were all I could see.

 I decided that my triple moving average system would work perfectly with live hogs, as the contract was called back then. I don't recall if this was the result of testing, where hogs looked the best, or if it was based on margin requirements, with hogs requiring relatively small margin. I suspect the latter. I liked the lower volatility of hogs, too, especially when compared to other agricultural products like soybeans and pork bellies.

 With my trusty calculator, the daily newspaper, and a sheet of paper with fi ve columns on it, every morning before work I'd record the date, closing price, and calculate the 4‐, 9‐, and 13‐day moving averages. Then, once I got to work, I'd call my broker and place any necessary trades.

 The fi rst few days and weeks of my fi rst trading system went fairly well. I lost more than I made, and I learned fi rsthand about slippage, broker's errors, and the general ineffi ciency of phoning in orders. But I was surviving, which I thought was the most important thing.

 Then disaster struck. I was long hogs, and one morning, I was up \$400. I was feeling great—this was my ticket to riches! At lunch, I spent a half‐hour trying to convince my ultra‐conservative and risk‐averse engineering coworker Dave that speculating in commodities was easy for a technical‐minded person. Just a few calculations, some simple math (no calculus required), and poof! Money would just add up in my account. He wasn't buying it, and I wondered why.

 After lunch, I found out why. I checked hog prices right after lunch. I went from up \$400 to down \$800. A \$1,200 swing in an hour or so. Twenty‐fi ve percent of my account vaporized, just like that. I was numb. And I still had the position open since my system hadn't given me a close signal yet.

 A few days later, and a few quick whipsaw losers after the big loss, I totaled the damage: \$1,500 in losses—30 percent of my account. Never in my wildest dreams had I expected that outcome. Panic set in. I stopped trading temporarily. Thank goodness I avoided the urge to double or triple my size to avenge my losses (such misguided dalliances would come later in my trading journey).

 I took the weekend to regroup, and fi gure out my next steps. Clearly, I mistakenly thought, after a handful of trades, it was obvious that my triple moving average system was no good. If that system was terrible, my money‐losing‐addled mind reasoned, then the opposite system would be the answer, right? Sort of like the episode of *Seinfeld* where George Costanza fl ourishes when he begins to do the exact opposite of what he has always done before.

 It was a *eureka* moment for me—if my fi rst system was so bad, then the opposite system had to be just as good! Plus, I did not even need to test or evaluate this plan. All I had to do was add \$1,500 to my initial account balance, instead of subtract it (for some reason, commission and slippage losses somehow became money makers in my twisted reasoning, but that is another story). Sunday night I went to sleep, in my mind thinking I had made \$1,500 with my reverse trading system, when in actuality I had lost \$1,500 with the original system. I was excited and happy. Monday morning, I was ready to jump in with both feet.

 Fast‐forward a few weeks, and hogs fi nally hit a great trend. It was a trend that a triple moving average system picked up perfectly. If only I were trading the original method! Of course, with the "opposite" method, big trends were a killer, and that is exactly what the market provided me—a huge losing trade. After that losing trade, my account was now down \$3,000, a 60 percent account loss brought on by the triple moving average and reverse triple moving average systems. I had had enough. I raised the white fl ag, called it quits for a while, and decided I needed more education.

# Enough Is Enough

fore I continue with my saga of losing money trading futures, you might be ask- $\mathbf D$ ing yourself, "Why was it so tough for this guy? I see ads every day for futures and forex trading, and it seems like any half-brained nitwit can make money easily. Why is this Kevin guy such a loser?" Good question, but let me ask it a different way: "Assuming trading is that easy—that you can spend five minutes a day entering orders on your computer, while relaxing on a white sand Caribbean beach—why isn't the person selling you this miraculous system for \$99 doing the same thing? Why is he spending his time practically giving away his secrets, instead of just trading his own ever-growing mountain of money?"

The answer should not surprise you: trading is tough, even for the so-called gurus, most of whom are not gurus in any sense of the word. I'd estimate that over 90 percent of the trading systems for sale are junk (and I am being generous here the actual number might be closer to 99 percent), marketed by people who figured out that selling to newbie traders was far easier, and far more lucrative, than actually trading. The statistics you hear about 80 or 90 percent of traders losing money is no lie, and the reason is that trading is really, really difficult. I hope that by reading about my trading journey and later learning about my trading process, you will get a sense of how challenging it is. At the same time, you'll come to realize that success in trading is possible but that there aren't any shortcuts.

#### Research

After my quick and disastrous initial foray into futures trading, with my subsequent 60 percent loss in account value, I was scared to trade again. I also realized there was much I did not know, and that if I wanted to succeed in the trading "wars," I needed

to bring more weaponry than just a simple moving average crossover. So I delved into just about any trading book I could fi nd. I read the classics like *Reminiscences of a Stock Operator* (George H. Doran Company, 1923) and *Market Wizards* (New York Institute of Finance, 1989), and newer get‐rich‐quick books by authors who probably never even traded. But regardless of the book, I kept an open mind and just soaked it all in. After reading probably at least a dozen books, I was very confused. Here is some of what I learned:

- Stop‐losses are a must. Stop‐losses are only for losing traders.
- Entries are all that matter. Exits are all that matter.
- Aggressive money management is the key to riches. Aggressive money management leads to account failure.
- Trend following is the best way to trade. Trend following is dead.

 I could go on and on, but you get the idea. For every trading "principle" espoused in one book, another book would claim the exact opposite was true. Which was right? Which was wrong? My head was swimming. But I kept on reading, gathering more information. Eventually, I concluded that all the books were right, and all the books were wrong. For example, for certain styles of trading, stop‐losses were a great idea. But, for other methods, stop‐losses would only stop you from making money. A light bulb went on over my head with this concept: there is no one right way to trade. What is important is to properly evaluate the way I wanted to trade, whatever that might entail.

 After this "aha" moment, I went out and bought a database of daily futures prices and got myself some programming software. Rather than use an expensive piece of trading software (in the early 1990s, trading software was not very popular and it was relatively expensive), I decided to create my own back-testing software, using Microsoft Excel and Visual Basic. I'll spare you the details, but suffi ce it to say that I had no trouble developing terrifi c‐looking trading systems. Creating nice‐looking equity curves turns out to be a trivial task when you neglect commissions and slippage. It is also easy to do when your system has 10 variables and you run 1 million iterations with various combinations of those variables. Typical newbie mistakes, and I was repeating each one of them over and over. The only thing that saved me was that the results were so good, and profi ts were so astronomically high, even I did not believe them. I assumed it was bad data or my software was faulty, but that wasn't the root cause. The main problem was that I was testing incorrectly.

 Because I felt my homemade systems were just "too good to be true," I luckily did not put any money into live trading these "Holy Grail" systems. Thank goodness I did not. Instead, I decided to abandon my testing and head off in a diff erent direction. This was all because of a book that said I could not lose in trading. Naiveté at its fi nest!

#### ■ **You Can't Lose—Or Can You?**

 The book that temporarily took me away from methodically testing trading systems was *You Can't Lose Trading Commodities* (R. F. Wiest, 1988), by Robert Wiest. At the time I read it in the early 1990's, the book was already over fi ve years old, and I remember its being prominently displayed in a local bookstore. I assumed this meant it must be a legitimate money maker to still be around after fi ve years. This book was all about scale trading. The concept is that you fi nd a commodity that is trading near a multiyear low, fi nd a fundamental reason for it to go up in the near future, and then buy on a scale down and sell with a small profi t. Here's an example: let's say wheat is currently at a 10‐year low of 300 cents per bushel. You also hear forecasts the next wheat crop is going to be much smaller because of bad weather. Your analysis indicates that over the next 6 months, wheat is likely to go up. So you buy wheat at 300 cents, hoping to sell it at 305 cents (\$250 profi t per contract). If the price falls to 290 cents, you buy a second contract, hoping to sell that at 295 cents. You continue to add to your position every 10 cents down, with a profi t target 5 cents above the corresponding entry. Ideally, the price will fall a bit, allowing you to buy three or more contracts, before it rises to 305, letting you exit with a profi t on each contract. Then, if the price fell again, you'd just repeat the process, scaling in and scaling out.

 The author claimed something like 90 to 95 percent wins with this method, which is entirely possible. But winning percentage is really meaningless. What matters is the return on account, and the drawdown. And, when done correctly, scale trading produces fairly low rates of return (10 to 20 percent), with fairly high drawdowns (20 percent or more). This is because you need a lot of capital to keep buying on the way down. If you don't have enough capital, you won't be able to continue buying. Then you won't be able to cash in on the lucrative oscillations in price. Eventually, if the situation gets dire enough, you'll be hit with a margin call, and your scale trading will likely abruptly end.

 Even with the drawbacks in the approach, scale trading appealed to me on an inexperienced trader level. All I had to do was fi nd commodities near multiyear lows and set up scales to trade them. I knew I would not be satisfi ed with only 10 to 20 percent return, so I had to make some adjustments, the main one being trading with a much smaller than recommended account size. This worked great the fi rst year I did it. I ended the year with about 90 percent annual return, all from scale trading.

 They say early success in any fi eld leads to eventual disaster, and that is what happened to me with scale trading. After a 90 percent annual return that fi rst year, I concluded I had this trading thing all fi gured out. Losses would be small and infrequent, but the cash register would keep ringing as I cashed in scale‐trading winner after winner. Of course, the market slapped me around, and slapped me hard, for thinking this way. I don't even recall which commodity was the source of pain—it might have been wheat, corn, cotton, or coff ee—but one of my second‐year scales went terribly

bad. I lost all my fi rst year's profi ts, and most of what was left in my account. For me, the book title *You Can't Lose Trading Commodities* should have been "When You Ignore Simple Directions, You Can Lose a Ton Trading Commodities!" Needless to say, I was done with scale trading.

#### ■ **Averaging Down—Adding to Losers**

 Although I abandoned the scale‐trading approach, I was intrigued with the idea of adding to my position as the price went against me. When this occurred, which was frequently, I could buy even more at a cheaper price! Then, when I was inevitably proven to be correct in my market analysis, I would gain even more profi t. I had already done the same thing with mutual funds through automatic investments; I'd buy more shares as the price fell, getting a better deal on the asset.

 The whole approach sounded too good to be true, and of course it was. Adding to a losing position works with mutual funds because (1) over time, mutual funds almost always go up eventually, and (2) mutual funds are not leveraged. With futures like wheat (my personal favorite for the adding‐to‐losers strategy), the price doesn't necessarily have to go up over a 5‐ or 10‐year period. Price could stay depressed for a long time, leaving you with a pile of open, losing trades. Plus, for every wheat contract you purchase, you need extra margin, and eventually even small price moves become huge swings in your equity. That is what happened to me.

 The year was 1998. For some crazy reason, I was convinced that wheat was due for an increase. In mid‐1998, wheat was at a fi ve‐year low (see Figure 2.1 ).

 Based primarily on that fact, along with some cursory fundamental analysis, I decided that wheat was on its way up to mid‐1996 highs. So I bought wheat. The price went down. I bought more wheat. The price went down some more. This went on from May to September, and every time I bought another contract, I dug myself deeper in a hole.

![](_page_9_Figure_6.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 2.1** In 1998, Wheat Was at a Five‐Year Low

 If the price of wheat kept falling, I knew it wouldn't be long before the margin calls would start arriving. Psychologically, I couldn't accept that, so instead I'd run to the bank at lunch once or twice a week, and have \$1,000 to \$5,000 wired to my trading account. Somehow, I thought this was a better option than getting a dreaded margin call. I did this so many times—skipping lunch, speeding to the bank, speeding back to work—that I had my own personal wire transfer lady at the bank. Her name was Cookie, and in those many trips to wire money, I learned a lot about her family, her grandkids, and her life. I even gave her little gifts and toys for her grandkids. At this point, alarm bells that should have been screeching were silent—wasn't it strange that I thought this constant wiring of money to a drowning trading account was a good idea?

 Luckily, starting in the beginning of September 1998, the price of wheat began to rebound. No more wire transfers! In fact, by mid‐October, I was getting close to breakeven. I started buying more contracts on the way up, further leveraging myself. I was convinced, though, that the low was in, and if that were true, shouldn't I be buying? All told, I was down about \$20,000 on the trade now, which was huge considering my account size. But the price was up, and I was looking to be king. Then came October 13, 1998 (see Figure 2.2 ).

 I remember October 13, 1998, for good and bad reasons. I was in Seattle on business, and after the market closed, I saw that wheat had gone up 6 points! Plus, my hometown baseball team, the Cleveland Indians, were in the American League Championship Series against the dreaded New York Yankees. I watched Game 6 from my hotel room, and in the fi fth inning, Jim Thome of the Indians hit a grand slam. Things were looking up, I thought. My Indians are going to win, and wheat is going up. Somehow, my mind linked the fate of wheat and the Indians together.

 Of course, you can guess how this story ends. The next inning, the Yankees scored three runs, and the Indians lost and were therefore eliminated from the postseason. Wheat also slowly and surely fell in price, and with the extra contracts I bought during the previous up leg, even a small correction was a killer. By the beginning of

![](_page_10_Figure_4.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 2.2** My Last Gasp with Averaging Down in Wheat

December, I was down about \$70,000 on that trade alone and out of funds I could wire to my account. Cookie would have to get toys for her grandkids from someone other than me, because I was done trading. At least for a year or two.

#### ■ **The Wild Man Emerges**

 After my averaging down approach miserably failed, I spent the next couple of years doing only minor trading, focusing on rebuilding my trading funds. When I had enough spare capital, I turned to what I call the "wild man" approach. With this approach, I did not need to test or evaluate any idea before trading real money with it. If I got a brilliant idea that coff ee should go down, I'd sell it. If OPEC was discussing stricter quotas, I'd buy crude oil. No real rhyme or reason to my method—just crazy trading based on whatever rumor I heard or whatever thought fl oated into my brain. I tried to keep losses small and winners big, but for some reason doing things the other way around was psychologically much easier. Plus, I still employed some tricks from my earlier trading, such as adding to losers. I'm sure my broker liked me, but my account equity did not. My account treaded water with this haphazard approach, but after a while I knew there was no future in it. Yet I still followed this approach, if you can call it that, until the fateful mad cow trade I discussed earlier. That trade and all the circumstances surrounding it were a cold slap in the face. I desperately needed to trade diff erently.

#### ■ **Time to Evaluate**

 As 2004 started, I was still licking my wounds from the live cattle/mad cow debacle. I took a long, hard look at my trading, and I did not like what I saw:

- Moving average crossover system—lost money.
- Reverse moving average crossover system—lost money.
- Tested thousands of systems—results too good to be true, never traded.
- Scale trading—lost money.
- Averaging down—lost money.
- Wild man approach—lost money.

 Almost no matter what I did, I lost money at it. The deceiving part was that for a while many of these methods would work, giving me an extra boost of irrational confi dence before the inevitable fall. The extra confi dence really just made the resulting crash tougher, both emotionally and fi nancially.

 Yet when I looked at my history, I saw the one bright spot: I did have success developing, but not live trading, mechanical trading algorithms. The problem was that I did not know if it was because I actually had good systems, or if good results were the result of a fl awed testing process (bad data, overoptimization, bad programming, etc.). I decided in early 2004 that this was my chance to become consistently profi table—I had to develop and test mechanical algorithms.

 Most of the fi rst half of 2004 was getting things in place—investigating trading ideas, looking at software options, determining how to do walk‐forward testing manually. For my strategy, I decided to go with a simple X day close breakout; that is, if the close today is the highest close of the last X bars, then buy at the open of the next bar. For short entries, it was vice versa. For exits, I employed a simple stop based on average true range, a fi xed dollar stop, a moving stop as profi ts accumulated, and a tightening stop that applied only when a big open profit occurred. It was a pretty simple system, but my initial results showed it worked well. Nothing earth shattering about this strategy's entries or exits—I am sure this approach was been applied by many people before. It is just a simple trend‐ following approach, and as long as some sustained trends develop, the system overall will make money.

 Even though up until this point I had used back‐test software I had developed myself, I decided that I did not fully trust the results. I obtained a copy of Trade-Station software, which at the time was probably the best and most popular (many people say it still is the best, and I still use it as my primary tool, but there are many other excellent back‐test programs available on the market today, too). In addition to making the testing easier, I had much more faith in the results. The only problem was that I wanted to utilize walk‐forward testing (discussed in great detail later), and TradeStation at the time did not support that feature. So I was relegated to running optimizations on TradeStation, then computing results and manually performing a walk‐forward analysis. It was tedious work, but at the same time it gave me a solid sense of how walk‐forward testing actually worked (I suggest your fi rst walk‐ forward test be done manually to increase your understanding.)

 By the last quarter of 2004, I had a system I felt was ready to trade. I stuck my toe in the water, making a few trades with the system, and found that the results matched the back test pretty well. Full‐size trading of my new system would begin in 2005. As 2004 ended, after more than 10 painful years of trying diff erent approaches, and eventually failing with most, I fi nally saw the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel. Thankfully, it wasn't a train coming at me! I had a tested method that worked with real money, and I wanted to shout from the mountaintop, "I am a good trader!" Since I live in Ohio, where mountains are a rarity, I did the next best thing: I entered a public, worldwide trading contest. Actually, I had entered the contest in 2004, but I used a pseudo mechanical, mostly discretionary system that did well for a while, but eventually fell apart. But this time, I'd be armed with a good mechanical approach and hopefully not embarrass myself. With that fateful decision, my trading adventure continued.
