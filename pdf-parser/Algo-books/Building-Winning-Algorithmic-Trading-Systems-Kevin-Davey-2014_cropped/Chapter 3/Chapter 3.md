# World Cup Championship of Futures Trading® Triumph

 $\bigcap$  ased on the work I had completed in 2004, I thought I had a viable trading  $\mathbf{D}$ strategy. Of course, I wanted to share my "success" with the world but at the same time not give away the strategy. So I did the next best thing: I entered a public trading contest.

For those of you who have never heard of it, the World Cup Championship of Futures Trading, sponsored by Robbins Trading Company, is the premier worldwide, real money, year-long futures trading contest. It attracts some of the best and brightest traders from around the globe, all matching wits and pitting strategies against each other. It is a high-pressure contest, with results constantly posted for all to see (back in the old days, results were published monthly in trading magazines; now they are updated daily on the World Cup web site: www.worldcupchampionships.com). In 1987, legendary trader Larry Williams turned \$10,000 into over \$1.1 million in that contest. That gives you an idea of the caliber of traders who competed.

Once I had my mind set on entering the trading contest, I had to make sure my system was good enough. Looking at the performance of past winners, I concluded that I had a reasonable chance of finishing in the top three contestants, as long as I had an annual return of 100 percent or higher. That was actually my goal; it wasn't

to win the contest, since I realized that at the upper end of performance, luck would play a role. I could not count on luck to win the contest; all I could do was set myself up to be near the top. To achieve 100 percent return over the course of a year, I knew I had to accept a very large maximum drawdown. I decided I would allow around 75 percent maximum drawdown, which would be ridiculous for any normal trader's account. But, as I'll discuss in great detail later, your goals and expectations should be based on the situation at hand. For a trading contest where the only success criterion was return on account, allowing a large drawdown makes sense. If, however, the contest were based on return and risk (say the winning contestant would have the highest Calmar ratio), I would have approached the contest completely diff erently. This will be discussed in detail later, but for now realize the goals and objectives I set at the outset dictated every subsequent step in the trading development process.

 As previously mentioned, I had developed a decent trading strategy in 2004. It actually would have been good enough to fi nish in second or third place in the 2004 contest, but, of course, I wasn't ready to enter at that point. However, I was ready for 2005 with the following system:

## **Entry**

 Buy next bar after 48 bar high close (vice versa for short), as long as the 30‐bar RSI was greater than 50 (less than 50 for short trades).

## **Exit**

Calculate stop based on:

Fixed dollar value (\$1,000)

Y \* average true range from entry

Z \* average true range from entry (profi t target)

## **Other Rules (based on my psychology, I felt I needed these)**

 If last trade was a loser, wait 5 bars before entering next trade (minimizes whipsaws).

 If last trade was a winner, wait 20 bars before entering next trade (be patient after wins).

 The system utilized daily bars for all trading signals, which was perfect for someone with a full‐time job, like me. Each night, I could simply review my charts, place any orders for the next day, and then not worry about the intraday variations. It was the ideal setup, as my time to check on my positions during the day was limited.

For markets to trade, I had a basket of nine futures that I looked at:

- Corn
- Cotton

- Copper
- Gold
- Sugar
- 5‐ or 10‐year Treasury notes
- Coff ee
- Japanese yen
- Nikkei Index

 I selected these for their past performance, their relatively low margin requirements, and their general lack of correlation to each other. Looking back on this, though, I realize I made two pretty big rookie mistakes. First, when I tested my system, I tested over 20 to 25 diff erent instruments. Then, upon seeing the actual performance, I simply selected the best performers. In other words, I optimized based on market! That is a big no‐no for good strategy development. For my second mistake, I did not run any detailed correlation studies when selecting the portfolio. Rather, I simply guessed at what I thought the correlation should be ("Corn and the Nikkei Index are probably not correlated, so I can trade both."). At the time, this seemed reasonable, but my experience since that time has taught me that correlations sometimes are diff erent than what common sense dictates, and should always be examined in a portfolio situation. Even then, it is important to realize that even noncorrelated instruments can become correlated during market panics. Thankfully, in spite of my rookie development mistakes, my trading approach still succeeded.

 Since my capital was limited (I started each year with a \$15,000 account), I could only trade one contract of each instrument. Occasionally, I had to skip a signal here and there, if I did not have enough available margin. At all times, I tried to trade as "fully loaded" as I could, using up as much purchasing power as I could while still avoiding margin calls. My plan was to take every signal and follow the system as best I could, within the constraints of my available capital.

 Here is how I performed, and some of my thoughts, in each of the years 2005 through 2007.

# ■ **2005**

 My equity chart for 2005 is shown in Figure 3.1 . After the fi rst month of 2005, I was slightly down. Huh? I was going to take over the trading world with this strategy, and yet I was losing money? It seems like this always happens to me—as soon as I start trading a strategy, it starts losing money. I was mentally crushed. I was down only

4 to 5 percent, but still it is always nice to begin the year with a bang. Thankfully, by mid‐April things were looking up. I was now up over 30 percent for the year, which would translate into a 120 percent return for the year. I was on fi re! Everything was working according to plan.

 Of course, just like any Hollywood movie, the story has to have a dark period. For me, that was a four‐month drawdown from mid‐April to mid‐August. Not only did it last a long time, but it also was severe—over 40 percent drawdown. At the lowest point, I had pretty much given up winning the contest or even coming close to winning. But I stuck to my plan. I was still trading the system as best I could, but I had to skip a few trades because of margin concerns. That summer was defi nitely a "bummer day 'round here" for my contest account.

 Things started to improve in mid‐June, and although it would take a few months to reach a new equity high, by mid‐December I had almost tripled my account. A couple of nice trends in Japanese yen and copper in September 2005, and a coffee trend in November really helped the account take off . That is really how trend trading works—you can have months of fl at to down performance, but catching a couple of trends can make your whole year. The problem, of course, is that if you miss the trend trade—let's say you give up before the trend shows itself because of the numerous false breakout losses, or you don't have enough money in your account to take every trading signal—your performance will be dismal. Because of this, trend trading is not for everyone, as it can be so psychologically diffi cult to follow.

 When I hit my peak equity in mid‐December 2005, I knew I was in good shape for the contest, for either second or third place. First place was out of the question, as the contest leader, Ed Twardus, was up over 250 percent for the year. With my confi dence riding high, I did violate my system toward the end of the year, when I added on to a losing position in coff ee. At the time, I was aiming for a 200 percent return, and apparently old habits die hard, since I was resorting to averaging down once again (will I ever learn?). So the last two weeks of December I gave back a chunk of equity. Lesson learned again: don't add to losers!

# ■ **2006**

 After my success in 2005, I realized that I had a good strategy, and if I traded it correctly, without emotion, I'd probably do okay in 2006. The problem with a public trading contest, of course, is that it is embarrassing when one month you are in the top three fi nishers, and the next month you are out of the top three. Worse yet is when you fi nd yourself right behind the lead trader. When that happens, it is very enticing to take a few fl yer trades to catch that person. I tried that back in 2004, in an ill‐fated attempt to catch eventual winner Kurt Sakaeda. Not that I had any chance, by the way: Kurt fi nished the year up 929 percent, a terrifi c performance. Yet he always remained very humble about his performance (a great characteristic for a trader).

 As trading in 2006 began, I had high hopes, a solid plan, and a clear head. My performance in 2006 is shown in Figure 3.2 . Unlike 2005, the fi rst month of 2006 was great for me. I was up about 30 percent, and I felt great about my chances. Of course, whenever I feel great about my trading, a drawdown is right around the corner. That happened in February and March and brought me back down to breakeven. A couple of losing trades in yen and 10‐year Treasury notes helped bring me back down to earth.

 But in the midst of this drawdown, in mid‐February, I would enter the trade that changed everything for me: I went long copper, as shown in Figure 3.3 . I held that one trade (actually two separate trades, after accounting for rollover) from February 17, 2006, to May 1, 2006, and it produced a net profi t of \$28,875 per contract. It was one of those once‐in‐a‐blue‐moon‐type trades, where the market just takes off , with me holding on for the ride. My account value on May 1 was \$45,122, so that meant that one copper trade was responsible for over 95 percent of my profi t for the year.

 At the beginning of May 2006, being up 200 percent already in the contest gave me a euphoric feeling. Little did I know that was my peak for the year, and the rest

of the year would be a slow downhill slide. During the rest of 2006, I still traded the system as planned, and I still traded only one contract for each trade. I probably should have traded larger size, since my account had tripled, but part of me was scared that I'd give back my profi t. That turned out to be a good decision, since most of the next seven months were net losers.

 Toward the end of the contest, I also had to contend with Michael Cook, a worthy opponent in second place. Although I knew the guidelines about just focusing on your own performance and not worrying about the other traders, I

 **FIGURE 3.3** Copper Skyrocketed, and I Was Long

had heard how good a trader he was, and I was scared of falling behind him—so scared, in fact, that I shut my trading down at the start of December. Part of this was warranted (just look at the previous six months of poor performance), but part of it was because I thought I'd make Michael beat me, instead of me losing to him.

 The ironic thing about my ceasing trading in the month of December, to preserve my eventual victory, is that that is not how I remember trading the contest years later. In my mind, I stuck to the system the whole year and traded per the plan up until the last day. I'm sure in public webinars and writings I have said the same thing—that I never stopped trading just to stay in fi rst place. Yet that is exactly what I did! And that disturbs me now. No, not that I ceased trading, but that I remember a diff erent reality. When that happens in trading, it is usually a bad thing. A good trader will remember things as they actually occurred, not as they fondly, but incorrectly, remembered.

 Even with the six‐month drawdown at the end, I was still able to fi nish in fi rst place in the contest. I felt validated—all those years of struggle had fi nally paid off . Now the question was: could I repeat that performance in 2007?

# ■ **2007**

 After fi nishing in second place in 2005 and fi rst place in 2006, I somehow felt that I had broken through, and now trading would be easier for me. Of course, the lesson I learned was that trading is never easy, and it is always a struggle. An enjoyable struggle, sure, but a struggle nonetheless. As 2007 began, I began the contest with high hopes. Also, I decided to trade two contest accounts (one crashed and burned), and try some little modifi cations to my core strategy. After all, I was still a bit spooked by the last six months of 2006, wondering how long my original system would suff er.

 Unfortunately, just like 2005, I started out in the wrong direction. My 2007 performance is shown in Figure 3.4 . Losing trades in just about every instrument plagued my eff orts, and by the end of March I was staring at a 50 percent drawdown. By mid‐May, due to some nice trades in orange juice and lean hogs (markets I added as part of my modifi cations), I was back to breakeven, where I'd remain for the next few months.

 In late summer and fall 2007, nice trends developed in Swiss franc and 30‐ year T‐bonds, and I rode them according to my system's rules. By the end of the year, I was up over 100 percent again, which was good enough for second place. Michael Cook, the trader I had been watching in my rearview mirror the last part of 2006, raced past me in 2007, finishing the year up a whopping 250 percent.

# ■ **Reflections on the Contest**

 After fi nishing fi rst or second three years straight in the World Cup of Futures Trading Championship, each time with over 100 percent return, I felt pretty good about my trading. To me, it did not prove I was a good trader, but rather it reinforced for me the importance of setting goals and objectives. Since I had developed my trading system to give me a chance to win the contest, I now realized that without goals and objectives established up front, the contest could just be considered gambling. As you will see later in the book, goals and objectives are a key part of what I do.

 After my second‐place fi nish in 2005, I wanted to let my informal mentor, market wizard Dr. Van Tharp, know of my success. I felt a bond to Van, as I had taken many of his home study courses and read most of his books. He was the closest thing to a mentor I had ever had. I was proud of myself, and I wanted to thank him. He was proud of my success, to be sure, but he also said this:

"And although Kevin has been trading and learning for 15 years, most people [who] win in trading contests are doing some very dangerous things with position sizing. So notice your reactions. Are you impressed with the people [who] win competitions? Or is your gut reaction to learn more about how to trade eff ectively in any market—and just stay in the game!"

 It took me a long time to understand what Van meant by this comment, with my fi rst reaction being anger ("how could someone not be impressed with my success?"). Eventually, though, I realized the wisdom in Van's words. The impressive thing is not winning a contest—luck, recklessness, and a host of other things can infl uence the fi nal results. The impressive thing is to trade the contest eff ectively. For me, that meant following my system, the one developed specifi cally to average about 100 percent annual return. So don't be impressed with the performance itself. I'm certainly not. What I am impressed with is my discipline in seeing a goal, chasing it, and realizing it. That, to me, is the real success.
