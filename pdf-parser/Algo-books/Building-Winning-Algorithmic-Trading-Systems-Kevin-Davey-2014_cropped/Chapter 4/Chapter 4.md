# Making the Leap-<br>Transitioning to FullTime

 $\mathsf{T}$ t is the dream of every part-time, retail trader—one who loves all aspects of trading to trade for a living, full time. At least that was always my goal, to live the dream. Trader Gary Smith wrote a book with just that title: *Live the Dream by Profitably Day Trad*ing Stock Futures (Advanced Trading Seminars, 1995). The dream, of course, is whipping the markets every day with your amazing strategies, taking as much money out of the market as you need (Want a new car? Simple—just double the size of your next trade!), spending your ample free time playing with your kids or doing volunteer work, or the typical stereotypical behavior: lounging on the beach, margarita in your hand, as bikiniclad women (or hunky guys, if that is your preference) stroll by on your private island.

The problem is that the dream is rarely, if ever, reality. The truth is that trading full time, as I tell many people, is in my opinion "the toughest way to make easy money." But that does not mean it cannot be done; it just means it is incredibly difficult. Anything great worth attaining is always difficult, right?

After about 15 years of part-time trading, quite a lot of unsuccessful trading, I had 3 consecutive years of contest-winning performances. As 2007 ended, I began to seriously consider trading as a full-time profession. After all, if I could not succeed at it, after all I had been through and all I had accomplished, who actually could? So in early 2008, I decided to take the plunge, and trade full time for a living. I thought I had it figured all out when I started trading full time. Boy was I wrong! I jumped into full-time trading doing some things, some things wrong, and many things I'd do differently if I had to do it over.

# ■ **Confidence**

 Even though you need many things to succeed at trading (capital, strategies, computers, etc.), self‐confidence will infl uence your long‐term success in full‐time trading more than most other things. It took me a long time to fi gure out that most of my trading success and failure wasn't due to having the fastest computer or having the Holy Grail of strategies. Rather, the confi dence in my trading abilities, the confi dence in my strategy development, the confi dence in my never failing optimism in the face of harsh drawdowns would help me survive as a trader. Obviously, confi dence alone will not get you there—regardless of what some trading gurus might say—but at some point, you'll need confi dence to weather a trading storm. Be it a major drawdown, many failed strategies, or an inability to develop new approaches, sooner or later confi dence in your abilities will be required to get you through the tough times. After three years of trading contest–winning success, I felt I had confi dence to succeed. After all, staring each day at three trading trophies (Figure 4.1 ) helped me feel like I was invincible.

## **What I Did Right**

I had enough confi dence to think I could succeed at full‐time trading.

## **What I Did Wrong**

 I probably had too much confi dence when I began trading for a living. After all, winning a trading contest is nice, but did it really mean I could trade full time? Now, I of course realize this. Back then, I equated contest success with full‐time success. That was a dangerous way of thinking.

# ■ **Capital**

 I'm sure you've heard the stories of people who started with \$1,000 and parlayed that into a lucrative full‐time trading career. I'm equally sure that for every one of those people, there are probably 999 who started with that amount and failed. After

all, as I'll demonstrate in a later chapter, being undercapitalized is the easiest road to ruin, whether or not you have a great trading strategy. Even a breakeven strategy will lead to ruin if your bankroll is smaller than your opponent's. The excellent book *Chances Are* ... *Adventures in Probability* by Michael and Ellen Kaplan (Viking Penguin, 2006) describes this very well:

Let's imagine some Buddhists opened a casino. Unwilling to take unfair advantage of anyone, the management offers a game at completely fair odds: flip a coin against the bank and win a dollar on heads, lose a dollar on tails. What will happen over time? Will the game go on forever or will one player eventually clean out the other?

One way to visualize this is to imagine the separate moment when the gambler is down to his last dollar. Would you agree that his chance of avoiding ruin is exceedingly small? Now increase the amount you imagine in his pocket and correspondingly reduce the bank's capital; at what point do you think than gambler's chance of being ruined equals the bank's? Yes: when their capital is equal. Strict calculation confirms two grim facts: the game will necessarily end with the ruin of one party—and that party will be the one who started with the smaller capital. So even when life is fair, it isn't. Your chances in this world are proportional to the depth of your pockets—the house wins by virtue of being the house.

Of course, you might protest, "But I have an edge, therefore I'll win in the long run." While that is true, remember your edge is likely small, and it probably will not last forever. Over time, it will likely regress to breakeven, and that means your account size becomes critical. Can you outlast your opponents?

#### **What I Did Right**

I started full-time trading with a low-six-figure account, although I kept some of that out of trading accounts, effectively "in reserve." I felt I was reasonably well capitalized.

#### What I Did Wrong

Based on my starting capital, I had to make 50 to 100 percent annual returns just to pay living expenses, taxes, and slightly increase my trading account. Wow! Looking back on that, I realize I was insane and started with about 10 times less than I should have. Another full-time trader friend once told me that every successful trader he knew started with \$2 to \$3 million before embarking on full-time trading. As crazy as that amount sounds (I would have scoffed at it six years ago when I started full

time), I now believe it is reasonable. After all, you want your trading account to grow over time, and you want to draw living expenses from it, and at the same time you need to survive the inevitable drawdowns. It is nearly impossible to accomplish all three on a shoestring‐sized account.

# ■ **Living Expenses**

 When I started full-time trading in 2008, I was fortunate enough to have three to fi ve years of living expenses saved up. That savings was not part of retirement, and was not part of my trading capital. I think those are the key issues to living expenses when embarking on full‐time trading. Trading is stressful enough without worrying about where your next meal or mortgage payment is coming from. You need to feel secure that your expenses are covered, even if you hit a drawdown right from the start (which always seems to be the case for me!).

## **What I Did Right**

 Due to years of saving money, and a lucrative change‐of‐ownership agreement I had at work, I could easily cover living expenses for quite a while, even with a growing family. Knowing that allowed me to focus on my trading 100 percent.

## **What I Did Wrong**

 Nothing. I think having three to fi ve years of living expenses in reserve was a great decision.

# ■ **Family Support**

 I am probably in the minority, but I had (and still have) a loving spouse who was totally on board with my dream of trading full time. For us, this meant my giving up an upper management position in the aerospace industry, where the sky—no pun intended was the limit. But she realized that my heart just was not in giving up my soul to a ruthless corporation, that I was destined for better things. My children also support my trading, and since they are young, it is really the only "job" they have ever seen me do. They understand when it is playtime, and when Dad has to work. It does seem to them—and to me, too—that it is a lot of the latter and not enough of the former.

## **What I Did Right**

 I married the right person, someone who understood and supported my trading 100 percent. Now, after six years of full‐time trading, she is still fully committed to my journey, and so are my three children.

#### What I Did Wrong

I pretty much nailed this right on. I shudder to think how much more difficult fulltime trading would be without a supportive spouse and family.

## ■ Home Office Setup

To save on expenses, I decided to trade right out of my house, in a dedicated home office. The distractions are many, especially with three young children now running around. Sometimes my work gets buried in a pile of crayon drawings, and sometimes an overeager child will accidentally close a spreadsheet without saving it first. Plus, my oldest even placed a few mini S&P trades on my open trading platform. At least his trades made money! Overall, though, I can't complain, when rush hour traffic for me is merely needing to dodge a few Legos on the stairs.

#### **What I Did Right**

I created a dedicated office for my trading business.

#### What I Did Wrong

I probably should have established firmer boundaries, such as no touching Dad's computer. But most of the time, intruding children are no problem.

## **Trading Strategies**

When I started full-time trading, I had about three to five strategies I felt comfortable going live with. Unfortunately, I did not have any extra strategies waiting in limbo, ready for trading when some of my first group of strategies lost their performance edge. Back then, I naively thought I could trade the same strategies forever. Now I realize that some strategies burn bright, like stars in the sky, for a long time. Others, though, are more like shooting stars—you need to stop trading them before they crash to earth.

#### What I Did Right

I had multiple strategies to trade. Even from the beginning, I knew it was a bad idea to rely on just one particular method.

#### What I Did Wrong

If I were starting full-time trading today, I'd make sure for every strategy I took live, I had at least one good strategy ready to take its place. Plus, I'd make sure I had a long list of potential strategies to test and evaluate.

# ■ **Brokers**

 Just like any other aspect of trading (computers, Internet connections, strategies, etc.), it is crucial that you have a backup for your broker. I don't mean having a backup phone number for the trade desk (which you defi nitely should have handy, by the way). I mean having multiple accounts at multiple brokers, ideally having different clearing fi rms. Brokers do fail from time to time (I was a victim of Refco's bankruptcy and of PFG Best's corrupt owner), and by having multiple accounts, you can still trade even if one broker goes down. Since I trade multiple strategies, it also makes bookkeeping a bit easier, since many times I'll dedicate one strategy to one specifi c account.

## **What I Did Right**

 I had multiple brokers, which used multiple clearing fi rms. So I think I was pretty smart in this regard.

## **What I Did Wrong**

 I've experienced two broker failures over the past 15 years, and some warning signs were evident with each of them—warning signs I missed or ignored. I assumed the system would make me whole, and that indeed happened in the Refco case. But I am still waiting for most of my money from the PFG Best case. That really irks me, which you can see fi rsthand by seeing my interview on Fox Business Channel (go to www.foxbusiness.com and search for "davey" and you'll see my interview).

# ■ **Free Time**

 Ahh, the days of working with the evenings free. That was life in the corporate world, for the most part. But now, working full time at home, I feel the need to check the markets at all times of day and night. Trading ideas pop into my head, and immediately I run downstairs to program and test them. Now most of my waking life is thinking about, or working on, trading. I have become too one‐dimensional in my pursuit of making a living full‐time trading. I think my wife believes that my trading computer is actually now part of me, since I seem to be attached to it so much.

 Of course, for many people who leave a job and start trading, the opposite could be true. All the free time, with no boss and no rules, lead many would‐be traders to a life of laziness. It is sometimes hard to stay motivated and continue developing new trading strategies, especially when your trading account is in a drawdown. Motivation can really be an issue, and while that might not hurt performance today, it can aff ect performance down the road.

#### **What I Did Right**

I have always been disciplined enough to keep working and never stop trying to improve my trading.

#### What I Did Wrong

I probably spend too much time working on trading, and I'll bet many of these extra hours are not the least bit productive. A trader, like any other self-directed worker, needs balance. I need to work on that.

## Taking the Plunge

Once I had all the foregoing items in place, at least to a point that I thought was acceptable at the time, I was ready to take the plunge. I took that full-time plunge in May 2008, and I haven't looked back since. Has it been easy? No way! Has it been fun? Definitely! Would I do it again if I had the chance? Of course, although I'd naturally be smarter the second time around. The main point here is that I had a goal, thought through all the details of it, and eventually took the gamble. If I—someone with no trading knowledge until I started reading some books and then trading—can do it, I think most people can. If your heart is in it, as mine always has been, the road to trading success is much easier. If you find all the talk of developing strategies to be burdensome, my suggestion to you is: walk away—trading probably is not for you.

As I look at my trading day, years after going full time, I find that most of my trading activity is not in placing trades or examining account statements. Rather, most of my day-to-day routine consists of developing strategies, looking for ideas, thinking about trading, and, of course, testing and evaluating potential strategies. Most of the rest of this book focuses on just that—how I evaluate, design, and test trading strategies.
