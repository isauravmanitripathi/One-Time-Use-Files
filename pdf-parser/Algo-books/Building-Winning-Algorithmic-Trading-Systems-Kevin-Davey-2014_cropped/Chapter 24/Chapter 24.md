# Real Time

 $\mathsf{X}\mathsf{I}$ hen I take a new strategy live, I like to review the performance on an ongoing  $\checkmark$  basis, to make sure things are going more or less as expected. For my euro day and night strategy, which I started live trading in late August 2013, here are my real-time updates every three to four weeks of trading it, for the first four months, along with a discussion of a few interesting events that came up along the way.

#### Four-Week Review—September 13, 2013, End Date

Week 4 of trading the euro day and night system with actual money is now complete. For the first few months of live trading, every four weeks or so, I review the current performance of the system as shown in Figure 24.1, and answer some standard questions. This information may be useful should the performance of the system become erratic—maybe there was something I could have seen earlier, or something I just plain out missed.

- **Summary:** Well, after four weeks of trading this system live, I am right where I started—breakeven.
- **Am I surprised at this result?** Absolutely not. It is well within expectations.
- Am I disappointed in the results so far? Yes. Anytime I start a new strategy I want to make money at the beginning.
- Are results in line with expectations? Yes. The current profit is below the average I expect, and it is above the lower 10 percent line. So, while it is underperforming currently, I see no reason for alarm. Also, I have had two winning weeks and two losing weeks. Over time, I expect about 60 percent of my weeks to be profitable, so the performance is just as I expect.

 **FIGURE 24.1** Daily Performance, After Four Weeks of Live Trading

**Are fi lls and trades live comparable to TradeStation strategy report?** Yes, in fact, in most cases my fi lls are better than what I had anticipated. Slippage is usually less than I had expected.

**Do I see any reason to stop trading this system?** No.

 **D o I see any reason to change my position‐sizing plan, that is, reduce or increase my risk?** No.

### ■ **Update after Week 7**

 Seven weeks into trading this system live, and things went bad this week, with a couple of large losing days. The cumulative equity is hovering right around the 10 percent line, which is generally a good warning sign that the system is not working the same as its historical test. If circumstances were diff erent, I might consider stopping trading this system. The things working against the "quit now" idea are:

- 1. There are only 18 days of live trading data—too short, in my mind, to make a decision to quit.
- 2. Most important, when I laid out the criteria for stopping live trading, performance relative to the daily performance was not considered (sometimes I do consider this in my "when to quit" analysis). For this strategy, though, I used maximum drawdown as my stopping criteria.

I will keep on trading, realizing that things need to improve.

 After seven weeks of live trading, is the system performing as designed? First, let's look at the number of trades it has taken. A sharp increase or decrease in the number of trades, when compared to the walk‐forward history, would suggest that the market action is diff erent than the historical market, causing many more, or far fewer, trades to be taken than normal. After seven weeks, the system has traded for 18 days, or 53 percent of possible days. Historically, it trades about 151 days per year, or 60 percent of days. So the system is trading less than the average. But some years it has traded as few as 130 days (51 percent) and as many as 175 days (70 percent). Based on all this, I'd conclude that the number of trades is generally in line with expectations, although at the low end. Anecdotally, I have felt that the volatility has been lower than usual. There have been a handful of days where an entry was missed by only a few ticks (the big Fed move day, September 18, was a case in point). A little more volatility in the hours before the announcement and the system would have entered a big winner.

 Second, let's look at average performance versus actual performance. The average historical performance of the system gives \$1,441 profi t after 18 trading days. Actual performance, however, is at −\$746. This is a *huge* discrepancy, and the conclusion obviously is that the system is not performing as well as it should. But here is where is gets tricky. Take a coin and fl ip it 100 times. If you get 60 heads, do you conclude that the coin is "broken," that is, biased? What if you got 70 heads, or 80, or 90? Even if you fl ipped 100 heads in a row, could you absolutely conclude that the coin is biased? No! There is a chance, albeit very, very small, that a fair coin could be fl ipped heads 100 consecutive times.

 It is the same way with a trading system. You can ask, "Is it broken?," but the answer will always have some degree of uncertainty. That uncertainty sometimes makes all the diff erence to your conclusions and decisions. Some people take statistics as gospel, but I'll relate a little secret I learned. Back in my previous career, I had a statistician who worked for me. I assigned a project to him that required a lot of data analysis and then some sort of conclusion. After he reviewed the details of the project, before he even started work, he asked me, "What conclusion would you like? I can make the data support your point of view, whatever it is." I was astounded, but I never forgot the lesson—statistics can be manipulated very easily, so be careful making any conclusions based on them.

 Right now, the actual system performance is at the 10th percentile of what was expected. The 50th percentile would be right at the average, so the 10 percent mark is pretty bad. But it is still within the realm of possible outcomes. If it were below the 0 percentile—let's say the system had lost \$8,000 through the fi rst 18 days—then the system obviously would not be performing as expected. That would be an easy decision. It is where there is uncertainty that things get tough.

 There are statistical tests that could be run to show whether the current trades could be part of the historical distribution of trades, but even such advanced analysis is not defi nitive. There is always a gray area. So how do I navigate the gray area? First, I try to determine the parameters that will cause me to quit trading a system. I could certainly use the percentile number approach and have a quitting rule that says, "If after X days the performance is below the Yth percentile, I will cease trading." X and Y would be at my discretion, based on personal preferences. As long as I stick to the rule I create at the start, I'd be doing fi ne. For me, and for this particular system, earlier I decided that I would quit only when I hit a \$5,000 drawdown. So I am not using the data in the tracking graph to decide when to quit. Sometimes I do use it, though.

To summarize:

- **Is the system performing as expected?** No, not even close. It is performing much worse than expected.
- **Is the system "broken?"** Maybe, maybe not. It depends on how you defi ne broken. One cannot say defi nitively it is broken or it is not broken.
- **Am I going to quit?** No. My quit point, established earlier, calls for a single‐ contract drawdown of \$5,000. This was a well‐thought‐out amount, and I can't just toss it out the window. I'm going to stick to the plan. I realize, though, that sticking to the plan might be akin to the captain sinking with the ship.

## ■ **Week 8 Review**

 Week 8 of trading the euro day and night system with actual money is now complete. **Summary:** First, let's look at the big picture. I like to do this regularly, because at a glance I can tell if things are going as planned or not. From looking at Figure 24.2 , a couple of things are clear:

- 1. Over the whole course of the system history (walk‐forward, incubation, live), the system performance hasn't changed much. I could draw a line from the start of walk‐forward to the start of incubation, and then another line from the start of incubation until the present time, and the slopes of those two lines would be about the same. This gives me some reassurance that the system is behaving, subject to point 2.
- 2. In Figure 24.3 , It is easy to see that the live trading (dark gray line with triangles) has not been up to par at all. The performance these past two months has been down, and while it has not crashed and burned, it certainly has been a disappointment.

 After eight weeks of trading this system live, I am down about 5 percent from the start.

 **FIGURE 24.2** Big Picture Equity Curve after Eight Weeks

**Am I surprised at this result?** Absolutely not. It is well within expectations. **Am I disappointed in the results so far?** Yes. After eight weeks, I had hoped to be making some money. The performance these past eight weeks is way behind the long‐term average, so it is very disappointing.

**Are results in line with expectations?** Yes. The current profi t is below the average I expect, and it is right around lower 10 percent line. So it is

![](_page_4_Figure_4.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 24.3** Daily Performance after Eight Weeks of Live Trading

underperforming currently, and I will be concerned if equity drops below that 10 percent line. Also, I have had four winning weeks and four losing weeks. Over time, I expect about 60 percent of my weeks to be profi table, so the performance is a bit behind in that regard. Plus, one week was really, really bad.

- **Are fi lls and trades live comparable to TradeStation strategy report?** Yes, in fact, in most cases my fi lls are better than what I had anticipated. Slippage is usually less than I had expected.
- **Do I see any reason to stop trading this system?** No.

```
Do I see any reason to change my position‐sizing plan, that is, reduce 
or increase my risk? No.
```

 After eight weeks, I will keep on trading per the plan, but storm clouds are forming on the horizon. I need some sunshine instead!

### ■ **Week 9—Automated Trading Issues**

 You've probably heard the phrase "automated trading does not mean unattended trading." You've also probably read all the disclaimers that the brokerage throws at you before they allow you to turn automation on. With TradeStation, for example, there are tons of disclaimers you have to sign when you open an account, and then if you want to automate a strategy, there are two more disclaimers you have to click and accept. The fi rst disclaimer is 397 words, and the second is a whopping 593 words. That is a lot of legalese to wade through just to automate your trading.

 But all those warnings are there for a reason. Ignore them at your own risk. That's what happened to me in week 9 of live trading. Let me explain.

 My euro day and night strategies enter on limit orders, which are supposed to be active for the current bar only. After the bar closes, any open orders get canceled by the software. Depending on the strategy logic, another limit order may be placed for the current bar.

 So, Monday night during week 9, my euro night strategy placed a limit order to buy, well below the market. It did not get fi lled during the bar, so it should have been canceled. For whatever reason, it was not canceled. This is the fi rst time I have *ever* seen this occur. The success rate of the software auto‐canceling orders, from my experience, has to be well over 99 percent. That is excellent, but errors can and do occur. Just look at the airline industry, for example. There are roughly 28,000 commercial fl ights per day, and if even 99.99 percent had successful takeoff s and landings, two or three planes would crash *per day* . That's where claims of 99 percent plus uptime, accuracy, whatever are meaningless. Anything less than 100 percent perfection runs the risk of costing you money.

 The order rested at the exchange until 5 a.m. Tuesday morning, when it was filled. I noticed this rouge position Wednesday morning. Of course, with Murphy's Law in eff ect here, I noticed it not when the position was profi table, but after it had gone negative. Then, to add insult to injury, while I investigated the issue—before I exited the position—I watched it drop another \$125 or so. Once I confi rmed that the position was wrong, I exited with about a \$550 loss.

 Who's to blame here? Well, the software did not do its job, since it should have canceled the order. But, ultimately, I can blame no one, and no thing (software, Internet connection, etc.), except myself for the error. I'll repeat that: I am to blame! I am the caretaker, and if things go wrong, as they occasionally will, it is up to me to be aware of it and fi x it. I take full responsibility for this screw up, and I added some steps to make sure it is not repeated:

- 1. Check statements every day. If I had checked it that fi rst morning, I'd have probably exited with a \$300 profi t, instead of a \$550 loss.
- 2. Check platform every few hours for uncanceled orders.
- 3. Improve checking of positions. I normally check my positions every few hours, but somehow this one slipped by me.
- 4. Make sure fi lled orders show up on the chart. For some reason, this fi ll did not—they usually do.

 Not a killer loss, but enough for me to getting pretty upset at the situation! Percentage‐wise, for this account, the losses were 7 percent, so that is pretty bad. Eventually, I want this strategy to get to 10 contracts, and at that point it would be some serious money.

 I noticed the bad trade about 30 hours after I entered it. Then I exited at almost the worst time, with a \$550 loss. Now, less than one hour later, I could have exited with less than a \$100 loss. Is it just me, or does this kind of stuff happen to you, too? If I did not know better, I'd swear that someone was controlling prices, and watching my positions, and deliberately doing things to maximize my losses! I can defi nitely see why people feel this way—at times, it surely feels like the market is out to get me personally!

 I've thought a lot about this occasional paranoia‐type feeling. I know why some of this occurs. I tend to discount—not really notice or dwell on—every good thing that happens to me (mistakes in my favor, excellent news reports right after I enter a position, etc.). Money‐making anomalies become just a blip in the equity curve. They are nice, but I don't really remember them too well. But I tend to remember losses due to mistakes and keep them fi led in my memory bank. Some of these "losing lessons" might be good to remember—today's automated issue is a good example—but most should be forgotten just as easily as the money‐making mistakes. That doesn't happen for me, at least not usually.

 Last year I actually did a study of this psychological phenomenon. I added up all my winning mistakes and all my losing mistakes. The net impact, from a monetary basis, was just about zero. But from a psychological standpoint, it defi nitely was not breakeven. One would think this feeling ("the market is out to get

me") would have disappeared after 20‐plus years of trading. But it hasn't, and I suspect it never will!

 By the end of the week, what should have been a decent winning week turned out to be a losing week, due to the entry "glitch" described earlier. That cost me \$550. I have taken some immediate steps to prevent it from happening again, and I think I am in the clear, at least for the time being. My actual performance now lags the perfect strategy performance, and the issue this past week is to blame for that.

 The problem ultimately comes down to this: if I am depending on a computer to place, cancel, and replace orders, unless someone is monitoring it at all times, there is always a possibility of something going haywire. The question is how much of my limited resources (it is just me, after all) do I devote to the eff ort to make the automation goof‐proof? Doing the usual amount of eff ort hasn't worked—since I just lost \$550—but at what point will I be confi dent that those issues will not occur? Plus, it is usually not the issues you know about, but the issues you don't know about. This case was one of them. After thousands of automated trades over the years, this particular issue had never come up before!

 Enough about that issue for now. Performance is still lagging, and the euro day system has not had a trade in two weeks (I think I can blame lower volatility for that). Regardless, I will "keep on trading!"

### ■ **Week 9—Limit Order Fills (October 28, 2013)**

 One of the tricks unscrupulous system vendors play is to assume that all limit orders are fi lled as soon as the price is touched. You can recognize this by looking at a price charts of their trades. If the method shows trades being bought at the exact low of a bar, and/or sold at the exact high of a bar, you can bet this game is being played.

 Of course, the reality is that it is hard to buy the low and sell the high. My experience is that, depending on the market and when your order is placed, you can probably do this 5–20 percent of the time. The other 80–95 percent of the time, price has to trade through your price to get you a fi ll at the limit price.

 This can be an issue with back testing. If your back‐test engine assumes that limit orders are filled when touched, the results will be too optimistic. If the back‐test engine assumes price must be penetrated to get a fi ll, then the back‐test results will be a bit too pessimistic. I always go with the pessimistic approach. My actual results can then only be better than the back test.

 During trading for week 9, the euro day strategy bought the exact low of the bar on a limit order. Of course, part of the reason I was fi lled was that I was trading a 1 lot; if I were trading a 10 lot, I probably would have received only a partial fill. The interes ting thing is that when I refreshed the chart, the trade went away, according to the strategy engine. Since the price did not go one tick below my limit price, the

strategy engine assumes there was no trade. But my real account says there was a trade because I was indeed filled. Since the trade was a winner, it was a nice surprise for once! So this is roughly a \$400 trade in my real account's favor, when compared to the back‐test engine. This makes up for the order problem that cost me \$500 in the previous week.

### ■ **Week 12 Review**

**Summary:** First, let's look at the big picture, as I always do. From a look at Figure 24.4 , a couple of things are clear:

- 1. Over the whole course of the system history (walk‐forward, incubation, live), the system performance hasn't changed much. Just as after week 8, I could draw a line from the start of walk‐forward to the start of incubation, and then another line from the start of incubation until the present time, and the slopes of those two lines would be about the same—with the slope from start of incubation to present being a little fl atter. This gives me some reassurance that the system is behaving well on a longer‐term basis.
- 2. It is easy to see that the live trading has been lagging long‐term performance. The performance these past three months has been down, and while it has not crashed and burned, it certainly has been a disappointment.

 **FIGURE 24.4** Big Picture Equity Curve after 12 Weeks

![](_page_9_Figure_0.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 24.5** Daily Performance, After 12 Weeks of Live Trading

 After 12 weeks of trading this system live, I am down about 10 percent from the start for the strategy‐calculated performance, and about 4.5 percent for the actual performance (Figure 24.5 ).

- **Am I surprised at this result?** Yes. I had expected better, certainly close to breakeven by now—at the very worst.
- **Am I disappointed in the results so far?** Very much so. The performance these past 12 weeks is way behind the long‐term average, so it is very disappointing.
- **Are results in line with expectations?** Just barely. Results are around the lower 10 percent line, which means the system in real time is close to being a diff erent system than walk‐forward and incubation. Not quite diff erent yet, but getting close.
- **Are fi lls and trades live comparable to TradeStation strategy report?** No, but it is a good thing! I am doing about \$550 better live than the strategy predicts because of (1) less slippage than I had planned for and (2) a few trades where I was filled in real life when price just touched, but did not exceed, my limit price.
- **Do I see any reason to stop trading this system?** No.
- **Do I see any reason to change my position‐sizing plan, that is, reduce or increase my risk?** No.

 After 12 weeks, I will keep on trading per the plan, but this system is just kind of fl oundering. A couple of big winners, which is what the system is based on, are needed.

### ■ **Week 13—Time Limit Review**

 As my strategy continues to fl ounder around breakeven, I start to wonder: how long am I willing to put my capital at risk without any return? The answer for me involves the "next best alternative."

 Every six months or so, I look at every system I am trading, and also the systems waiting in the wings (ready to be traded live, but currently not trading live). If I fi nd a better system than the one I am trading, and I don't have enough capital to trade both (or perhaps because of correlation issues I do not want to trade both), I will replace it. Thus, even if the euro trading strategy is performing decently (making money as opposed to its current situation of near breakeven), I still might replace it with the "next best alternative."

 I do this exercise only two times a year, in part because it is involved (complicated correlation studies, etc), but mainly because it is only fair to a new system going live to have some time to prove itself. Most people don't have the patience to do this, and they jump from system to system, never giving any system a fair chance. It would almost like pulling a pitcher in baseball from the game as soon as he gives up just one hit. As I showed earlier, even winning systems can be losers for quite a while, until the long‐term positive expectancy really shows itself.

 Of course, even with this twice‐a‐year analysis, my original quitting point is still in eff ect. If I hit that, I am out, regardless of the next best alternative (which may be cash).

## ■ **Week 15 Review**

**Summary:** After 15 weeks, the euro day and night trading strategies are fi nally doing better, as depicted in Figures 24.6 and 24.7 . By looking at the big picture, it is clear that the performance of the past few weeks is getting the live results closer to the historical back test. The system still has to improve performance, but things are certainly looking better. After 15 weeks of trading this system live, I am up about 1 percent from the start for the strategy‐calculated performance and about 9.0 percent for the actual performance.

- **Am I surprised at this result?** Obviously, I was hoping for better, but I am thankful that the system is showing a profi t at this point.
- **Are results in line with expectations?** Results are defi nitely more in line with expectations, especially in the past few weeks. But the strategy as a whole is still underperforming. As stated earlier, this approach relies on a handful of big profi t trades per year, and so far in live trading there have not been any.

![](_page_11_Figure_0.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 24.6** Big Picture Equity Curve after 12 Weeks

**Are fi lls and trades live comparable to TradeStation strategy report?** No, and that is still good! I am doing about \$700 better live than the strategy predicts because of (1) less slippage than planned and (2) multiple trades where I was filled in real life but not in the back‐test engine (limit price penetration issues).

![](_page_11_Figure_3.jpeg)

 **FIGURE 24.7** Daily Performance after 15 Weeks of Live Trading

#### **Do I see any reason to stop trading this system?** No. **Do I see any reason to change my position‐sizing plan, that is, reduce or increase my risk?** No.

 After 15 weeks, I will keep on trading per the plan, but this system is still underperforming, compared to original expectations. That is one drawback to a trading approach that requires large, but infrequent, winning trades. It might be a long time before this system really shows its capability.

### ■ **Future Reviews**

 This running diary will continue indefi nitely, or until I stop trading the euro day and night system, at which point I'll explain any reasons I had to stop live trading. Updates can be found at the web site (www.wiley.com/go/algotradingsystems).
