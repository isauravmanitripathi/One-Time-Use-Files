# Position Sizing and<br>Money Management

 $\mathbf{T}$ p until this point I haven't discussed position sizing or money management in any detail. That isn't to say I don't value it; I agree in large part with position-sizing guru and author Ralph Vince, who states that position sizing is one of the most important things in trading. The problem is some people take that view to the extreme, and believe that position sizing is the only thing that matters. That is simply not true. Use superb position sizing with a losing strategy, and you'll still lose in the long run.

Many people have written books about position sizing and money management, and just like with general trading books, some are good and some are bad. The best ones I have found include Van Tharp's *The Definitive Guide to Position Sizing* (Van Tharp Institute, 2013 [2nd ed.]) and the numerous books by Ralph Vince. Vince's books are more mathematically based, and tough for inexperienced traders to understand and follow, but the underlying messages he puts forth are usually good ones. So in this chapter I won't try to recreate the wheel; I'll instead refer you to those authors for more in-depth information. In this chapter, I'll discuss how I employ position sizing, both for a single system and on a portfolio level. But first, I'll share with you my thoughts on general position-sizing issues.

#### No Optimum Position Sizing

In all my studies on position sizing, I have determined there is no optimum or one and only one correct way to position size, regardless of trading system. Some trading books out there claim that their unique method is the best, and then prove it to you through an example or two. This, of course, is bogus. For any given equity curve, you can try

diff erent position‐sizing models and fi nd one that is the best for that particular curve. But, you can't then say that is the best way to position size for any system. A good case in point was a book written a while back (I will not mention the title) that developed a new position‐sizing method. This method basically took more risk at the start of trading and, as the account grew, scaled back the position sizing. This works great when the equity curve does well at the beginning, which is what most of the book's examples showed. What most people don't know is that same author applied his "superb" method in real time and quickly blew out numerous accounts. This was likely because his account started out going down instead of up. So, don't assume that a position‐sizing method that works well with one trading system will work well with all trading systems.

# ■ **Risk and Reward Are a Team**

 Many people look for a magic position‐sizing technique that provides extra reward, without any extra risk. In general, though, reward and risk go hand in hand—if you want more reward, you have to be willing to risk more. Where this gets a bit murky is in reviewing results. Based on the return and drawdown shown in an equity curve, it may look like you received a lot of extra reward (return) for no extra risk (drawdown). But you must remember that the risk taken at the start of the trade won't show up in an equity curve. The risk is there; it was just never realized. No matter what the fi nal results say, in the long run you'll be better off assuming that when you want more reward, you have to be willing to risk more.

# ■ **Position Sizing Can Be Optimized**

 Many traders will develop a strategy, run it through all the development steps, and afterwards, test out 5 or 10 diff erent position‐sizing techniques, picking the best one. Many of these same people don't realize that they have just optimized—not on a particular entry or exit parameter, but instead on the position‐sizing method itself. Just as with optimizing trading strategies, just because one method was optimum on past data, it does not mean it will be optimum going forward. In fact, chances are it will not be the best. If you are dead set on testing diff erent position‐sizing techniques on a trading strategy, make sure you use Monte Carlo analysis. This will give you a much better indication as to which position‐sizing method, if any, is better.

# ■ **Losing Systems Cannot Become Winners**

 No matter what type of position‐sizing approach you use, if your core trading strategy is a loser, no position‐sizing method will save you. That is where it gets confusing, when certain trading gurus state that position sizing is all that matters. While they are espousing the importance of position sizing, they are not saying you can win with a losing system. If this idea was true, you would have more rich casino gamblers out there. No one, to my knowledge, has ever used position sizing to succeed long term in any casino game where they don't have an edge. This doesn't include cheating, or card counting, or any other method that gives you an advantage or edge. In those cases position sizing can help you immensely. If you have a terrible strategy, in the long run the choice of position‐sizing technique is irrelevant; you will lose no matter how you size. Start with a strategy that gives you an edge, then apply position sizing.

# ■ **Winning Systems Can Become Losers**

 You would think that since loser trading systems cannot become winning systems through position sizing, the opposite is also true: winning trading systems can never become losers when employing position sizing. Nothing, and I mean nothing, could be further from the truth. It is exceedingly easy to take a winning system, apply an overly aggressive or inappropriate position‐sizing method, and still lose all your money. Over the years, I have seen many people do this. Most think that when they have a winning system, they must push "the pedal to the metal" and trade as aggressively as they can. Most of these same people crash in spectacular fashion during an inevitable future drawdown.

# ■ **The Fantasy of Size**

 Almost every two‐bit huckster out there selling a trading system will have some sort of sales pitch that goes like this: "If you use my method, you can get \$5,000 profi t per contract per year. So if you trade 100 contracts—all it takes is adding a few zeros to your order quantity—you'll soon be making a very good living!" If you can't immediately see through the transparency of this claim, I'll explain the fallacy. First, the huckster assumes you'll have enough margin in your account to actually trade 100 contracts. If you have determined that a \$10,000 account is appropriate to trade one contract (which, by the way, is already considered aggressive by many traders), then you would need a \$1 million trading account. If you had that much money in your account, you'd probably be smart enough to never listen to the huckster's pitch in the fi rst place! Remember, drawdown is always possible, and your account needs to consider that.

 The second fallacy in the "trade 100 contracts" scenario is that most people could not handle it psychologically. Sure, if the equity curve is always increasing, trading 100 contracts and banking \$500,000 a year is easy. But when you have 5 losing trades in a row, and you lose \$100,000, psychologically that could be a killer. Your best bet, therefore, is to ignore the hucksters and position size so that you slowly

add on contracts, and acclimate yourself to the dollar amounts involved before you increase size again.

# ■ **Short Term—Go for Broke**

 If your edge is small, and you want to trade for only a very short time, just go crazy with position sizing. Chances are, over the short run, you probably will win. In the long run, you'll be toast, but in the short run you'll be profi table. A classic example of this is with a Martingale betting strategy. You begin by betting one coin. Every time you lose, you double your bet (two, four, eight, etc. coins). When you eventually win, you win back all your original bets, plus \$1 profi t. The interesting thing about this approach is that if you play it just once with no bet limit, you will almost always make \$1 (i.e., winning one betting sequence). But if you play it over and over, your odds of overall success go to zero because eventually there will be a betting run of consecutive losses you cannot recover from. Of course, betting one sequence and then walking away is impossible for most people. Still, it is an option that is usually successful. When you add in bet limits for Martingale, the approach becomes even less attractive. I know quite a few former traders who tried Martingale over the years; note I described them as "former."

# ■ **No Position Sizing = No Good!**

 Whether it is fear of loss, lack of confi dence or some other issue, many people who have winning trading systems never position size. Instead, they continue to trade the same size for years. This to me is almost as bad as being too aggressive with sizing. When you have a winning system, you have the goose with the golden egg. Take care of that goose, learn what it can eat to maximize egg production, but don't overdo it. After all, you need to make full use of the goose while you have it.

#### ■ **Strategy, Then Position Size, or Strategy and Position Size Together?**

 For most of my development career, I have developed the strategy fi rst, based on always trading a single contract. After development is completed, I then apply position sizing. This is a good way to go, especially when your fi nal position sizing is for a portfolio of systems.

 Fellow trader Andrea Unger, who also trades for a living, disagrees with my approach. Considering that he has won the World Cup Championship of Futures Trading four times, I think I am safe in listening to him. His argument is as follows: when you develop a system trading a single contract, you'll get a good system, but maybe not one that takes advantage of position sizing. For example, if you include position sizing in your development process, you are likely to end up with smaller losing trades, since that will allow you to trade with more contracts, leading to a higher net profi t. This defi nitely makes sense, based on my own experience. One of my favorite trading systems I developed was based on one contract being traded. Unfortunately, that system has relatively large losses (\$2,000 to \$3,000 per contract), making it tough to position size, unless the account is very large. Just think of the account size you need if you want to trade 10 contracts, where a \$30,000 loss on one trade is possible. With a \$300,000 account, one losing trade would lead to a 10 percent account loss. This is much too large a loss, even for the most reckless of traders. Therefore, in this case, maybe developing the system with position sizing would have suggested a parameter set where \$500 maximum loss was optimum. This system would be much easier to apply position sizing for a smaller account.

 So, even though I prefer not using position sizing during development, recognize that at least one (and probably many more) great traders do develop with position sizing. It might be worth trying both approaches on your development projects, to see which one you like the best.

# ■ **Positioning Size—Single System**

 Whenever I begin trading a new strategy, I almost always start at the smallest size possible, typically only one contract. Many people think the exact opposite; if you have an edge, you need to exploit it with big size as soon as possible. After all, what if the edge disappears? That is a good point, but in my experience, starting small is better. First, even with all the development, testing, and incubation, the system still might not have an edge, even though I think it does. Trading small will limit my loss in such a case. Second, I always become emotionally invested in strategies when I start trading—after all, I want to see my creation succeed—so trading a small size takes any emotion out of the equation. This new strategy becomes just another strategy in my portfolio. My fi nal reason for starting small is that I want to increase size based on the profi ts of the strategy. If the strategy makes money, it will ramp up in size. If it stays fl at or loses money, my downside is limited.

 Even though I start with one contract, I always know in advance what my sizing scheme will be as I build equity. Most of the time, I just use fi xed fractional sizing:

$$N = int(x * \text{Equity/Largest Loss})$$

where

*N* = Integer number of contracts (always round down) *int* = Integer function

*x* = Fraction of equity to bet on each trade Equity = Current account equity Largest loss = Largest historical loss from walk‐forward back testing

 The only variable that is at my discretion is the fi xed fraction *x.* Many traders will say that *x* can be no more than .02, or some other value. While I can't argue with keeping the value of *x* low, I prefer to use Monte Carlo simulation to show me the best value of *x,* which for me is one that maximizes my return/drawdown ratio. This is, of course, subject to other constraints such as risk of ruin and maximum allowable drawdown. An example will make this clearer.

 To look at the impact of fi xed fractional sizing, I use the Monte Carlo simulation analysis of the euro system I will present later. I run the analysis with various values of the fi xed fraction *x,* and look at the following charts:

 Median rate of return—I want as high as possible. Return/DD ratio—I want as high as possible. Median max drawdown—I want this as low as possible. Risk of ruin—I want this as low as possible.

 Obviously, since I am trying to maximize return and minimize drawdown, there has to be a happy medium somewhere. This depends not only on the results but also my personal preferences. For instance, if I did not care what the drawdown or risk of ruin was, I'd select the peak point on the return or return/DD chart. This corresponds to *x* = 0.32, and also is Ralph Vince's optimal *f.* But, with *x* = 0.32, I'd have a 50 percent chance of having a max drawdown equal to or greater than 67.4 percent. Plus, my risk of ruin would be 21 percent. Wow! Those values are too high for me. But I will accept a 45 percent maximum drawdown and a 10 percent risk of ruin. Eliminating all chart points that do not meet these criteria result in a max value of *x* = 0.175, as shown in Figure 16.1 . Therefore, I will use this value of *x* in my trading for this particular system.

# ■ **Positioning Size—Multiple Systems**

 Since I am trading multiple systems at any one time, I have to respect any correlation between the results. That is, I can't independently determine the value of *x* for each system, and then just trade them together. Instead, I analyze all the systems together, and try all values of *x* for each of them. Just as with the single system, I want values of *x* for each system (each system will indeed have a diff erent value of *x* ) that maximizes my return/DD ratio, subject to maximum allowable drawdown and risk of ruin. An example of this process is shown in Figure 16.2 , where fi ve diff erent systems are traded at the same time. The values for *x* for each system maximizes the return/DD, subject to the loss constraints I have chosen.

 Obviously, I have just scratched the surface with position sizing, but I have given you an idea of how I approach it. As stated earlier, my philosophy is to go slow at fi rst and let the system profi ts generate most of the extra capital needed for position sizing. This helps me keep the risk at a manageable level. Since I use fi xed fractional sizing, you might wonder how you could employ a diff erent sizing technique in your analysis. Simply take what I have shown here and modify it for your sizing approach, and conduct the same analysis. You'll then have a logical analysis for whatever position‐sizing method you decide to employ.
