#### **Futures Models**

Futures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a specified time in the future. But only a diminishingly small part of futures market participants use these contracts for such things. The original idea with futures were to enable farmers higher economic certainty by selling their future harvest at today's known prices. As with most financial innovations, it quickly turned into another part of the great casino out there and became a popular vehicle for traders.

There are some great properties of futures that we are going to make use of in this book, and there are also some dangerous potential. The dangerous way to see futures is as easy leverage. The fact that you are able to take on enormous risk in the futures markets does not necessarily mean that it's a good idea to do so.

In the futures markets you can take positions many times larger than in the stock markets. If you have an account size of a hundred thousand, you could easily put on a position of a million or more. That's a great way to wipe out your account quickly, and this feature of the futures markets tend to appeal to the gambling type. As in a casino, you could double your money in a day or lose it all in a minute. That's not how we will use futures in this book.

This author would argue that the futures markets is the most interesting space for systematic trading, owing mostly to the vast diversification potential. The one weakness of course with futures markets is the fairly high capital requirements to play this game. The most interesting type of systematic models require a larger capital base than most readers of this book will have available. But before you stop reading to draft a letter asking for a refund, know that almost no one makes interesting money trading their own capital. The real

money is in asset management, and the fees that can be made by doing a good job managing other people's money.

### **Futures Basics**

Futures are the only derivatives I intend to cover in this book. They are quite straightforward, easy to understand and trade. I certainly don't mean that they are simple to make money from, but they have very little in common with the highly complex world of options trading.

The one really great feature of futures is the standardization. This is the single most important thing you need to understand about futures. The very reason that they became so popular with professional systematic traders, such as the now prolific trend following industry, is the standardization.

Because they are standardized, you can trade a very wide array or markets in the same way. You can trade cotton and lean hogs the same way as you trade equity indexes and currencies. The same mechanics, the same math, the same terminology. It makes things so much easier. There are some minor differences between futures markets, but for most purposes they work more or less the same.

The futures markets can open a whole new world for you. If you are used to being an equity trader or a forex trader, now you can suddenly trade everything in the same way. There is really very little reason to pick a single asset class to trade, when you can get so much diversification benefit from trading all of them. And the futures markets is just perfect for this.

A futures contract is mutual obligation to conduct a transaction in a specific asset at a specific future date, at a specific price. That's

the textbook definition, and while it's important to understand this part, it works a little different from a practical point of view.

The original purpose of futures is hedging. The simplest example may be a farmer who will have a crop of corn ready to ship out in three months and would like to lock in the price. He can then sell futures contracts for delivery in three months, and be sure to lock in the current price levels. A breakfast cereal company may need to buy that corn in three months, and they would also like to avoid the price risk in the next few months. They take the opposite side of that futures position, locking in current price levels.

The same example could be made with most futures markets, whether the underlying is oil, currencies or bonds, the hedging argument works in theory. Of course, in reality an overwhelming part of all futures trading is speculation, not hedging.

You buy the gold futures contract if you believe that gold is going up. If you think that the Yen is about to move down, you go short that contract.

As mentioned, the futures contracts are a mutual obligation to take or make delivery. That's the theory, but not exactly the reality. Some futures markets have physical delivery, while others are cash settled. Commodities and currencies are generally physically settled for instance. That means that if you hold a long position of live cattle futures until they go into delivery, you may find yourself with a truck of slightly confused bovines outside your office. In theory.

These days, practically no bank or broker will allow you to hold a physical futures position past the date where it goes to delivery, unless you happen to be a commercial trader with specific arrangements allowing for physical transactions. If you have a regular brokerage account, there is no risk of unexpected bovine surprises. Your broker will shut your positions down forcefully at the last moment, if you fail to do so yourself. Not out of altruistic reasons of course. They are no more interested in dealing with physical settlement any more than you do.

Currency futures however are usually allowed to go to delivery, so be very careful with those. If you have a currency futures contract open at expiry, you may get some larger than expected spot conversions going on in your accounts. That may or may not have happened to yours truly a long time ago, but I will strongly deny any such rumors.

Another highly important point with the standardization of futures contracts is regarding counterparty. When you buy a gold futures contract, that means that someone else out there is short the same contract. But there is no need to worry about who that person is, and whether or not your counterpart will welch on the deal or fail to pay up in time.

With futures, your counterparty is the clearing house, not the individual or organization on the other side of the trade. You have no counterparty risk towards whoever is on the other side.

# **Futures Mechanics and Terminology**

If you are used to the stock market, the first thing you will notice with futures is the limited life span. You don't just buy gold futures. You buy a specific contract, such as the March 2017 gold futures contract, for instance. That contract will no longer exist in April of 2017, so you can't just buy and hold futures like you could with stocks. You always need to make sure that you hold a position in the right contract, and keep rolling it. The word right is dangerous of course, but most of the time the right contract would be the one that's most actively traded at the moment. For most futures markets, there is only one highly liquid and actively traded contract at any given time. Sometime before the expiry, the traders will start moving to another contract and there will be a new active contract. The process of moving positions from one month to another is referred to as rolling.

Another key thing to understand about futures is the mark-tomarket procedure. When you buy a futures contract, you don't actually pay for it upfront. You do need to put up a margin, a kind of collateral, but more on that later on. As opposed to stocks and bonds, you don't actually pay the whole amount, you just need to have a small part of it available to make sure you can cover potential losses.

The mark-to-market procedure settles all positions at the end of the day. When you have futures positions open, you will see a daily cash flow. If you lost two thousand dollars on the day, that will be automatically deducted from your cash account at the end of the day. If you made a gain, it will be credited. Therefore, the value of a futures position is always zero at the end of the day. It has been marked to market.

Each futures market represents a certain amount of the underlying, not just one unit. For example, a gold contract represents 100 ounces, a crude oil contract is for 1,000 barrels and the Swiss Franc contracts 125,000 CHF. This property is what is called contract size. For most contracts, the contract size is also the same as the more important property point value. There are a few exception to that rule, such as for bonds, but most of the time they are the same.

The reason that the property point value is more important to us is that this is what you need to multiply with to calculate your profit or loss. The point value, sometimes referred to as big point value, tells you how much money you gain or lose if the futures contract moves one full currency unit. You always need to be aware of the point value of the market you are trading.

Take gold as an example. You buy a single contract of the March 2017 gold at \$1,400 on Monday. By the closing time that day, the price is \$1,412, exactly 12 dollars more than the previous day. Since every full dollar move represents 100, the point value for the gold market, \$1,200 will now magically appear on your cash account in the evening.

The next day, the price of the gold futures moves down to

\$1,408, and \$400 will be deducted from your account. On the Wednesday you close the position, selling the same contract, at \$1,410, and \$200 dollars is credited to your account.

And that, in a nutshell, is how futures work.

Every individual futures contract has a specific code. From this code, you can see the market, the delivery month and the delivery year. The standard code for a futures contract is simply those three things, in that order. The March 2017 gold, for example, would have the code GCH7, or GCH17 if double digit year convention is used.

Typically the year is designated with a single digit, but some market data providers and software vendors use double digits. In this book we will use two digits as that's the required format for the Zipline backtesting software.

When you deal with futures for a while, the syntax of the tickers will become second nature. If you are not yet overly familiar with this instrument type, you should take a moment to look at Table 13.2. Anyone trading or modeling in this area should know the monthly delivery letters.

| Month     | Code |
|-----------|------|
| January   | F    |

## **Futures and Currency Exposure**

When it comes to currency exposure, futures differ quite a bit from stocks. This topic is of course only relevant if you trade markets denominated in different currencies.

For stocks, you pay for your purchase up front. That means that a US based investor who buys a million Euro worth of stocks in France has to exchange his dollars for Euro. He would then have an open currency exposure of one million, unless he chooses to hedge it.

In the case of international stocks, you would then in effect have two positions on. One in the stock, and one in the currency. When modelling and backtesting strategies, this can be a significant factor.

For futures on the other hand, the currency impact works a bit differently. Remember that we are not paying for futures contracts the way we pay for stocks. We just put up a margin, and then have the daily profit or loss netted on our account.

That means that your currency exposure for international futures is limited to the profit and loss.

If you buy a British futures contract, you have no initial currency exposure. If by the end of the first day, you make a thousand Pound profit, that amount will be paid to your Sterling account. Now you have an open currency exposure of one thousand, but not on the full notional amount of the contract. If you lose the same amount next day, now you have no currency exposure.

Thereby, currency exposure is a much smaller issue with futures, and one which can almost be approximated away.

## **Futures and Leverage**

The fact that we only need to put up a margin, and not pay for futures in full, can have some interesting implications. This means that in theory, we can take on very large positions.

It's rarely worth wondering just how large positions you could take on, if you were to max out your risk. You can take on far larger positions than you ever should anyhow. And that possibility is often misused by retail traders. If your motivation to trade futures is that you can take on higher risk than with stocks, you should stay with the stocks. Using futures for cheap leverage is a very bad idea.

But the possibility of taking on these enormous position sizes has a very clear advantage. When you deal with cash markets, like stocks, you are more or less limited to 100% notional exposure. Sure you can leverage stocks, but that's expensive and restrictive.

But with futures, you can start by deciding what risk level you are looking for, and use that to guide your position sizes. There is no need to really care about the notional exposure of your portfolio, as long as you have a firm eye on the risk side.

This means, among other things, that we are able to take on meaningful positions in very slow moving markets. The short term interest market for instance, where daily moves larger than 0.1% are rare, wouldn't be of much interest if we were limited to 100% notional exposure. It just wouldn't be able to have a noticeable impact of the portfolio.

But this is a clear benefit of futures. We can use risk as a guide, instead of notional exposure.

Leverage can wipe you out, but correctly and deliberately used, it allows you to construct much more interesting trading models.
