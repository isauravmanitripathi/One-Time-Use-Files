# **Criticisms of Quant Trading**

*Computers are useless. They can only give you answers.* -Pablo Picasso

**D**ecently, and periodically in the past, people have loved to hate quants. In 1987, a quant strategy known as *portfolio insurance* was blamed for the crash that occurred that October. In 1998, people blamed quant models for the LTCM crisis and the near-collapse of financial markets. In the summer of 2007, though, it might well be that the tide of public opinion turned from leery and suspicious to overtly negative. There could be many and various reasons for this sentiment. Some of the predilection is likely owed to widespread hatred of math classes in grade school, some of it to fear of the unknown, and some to occasional and sensational blowups by one or several black boxes. But, as is the case with many things that are not widely understood, the arguments against quant trading range from entirely valid to utterly ridiculous. It is worth noting that almost every type of trading in capital markets faces valid criticisms. In other words, quant trading, like any other type of trading, has its pluses and minuses.

This chapter addresses many of the most common criticisms of quant trading and some of my own. Where relevant, I also present counterpoints in defense of quants.

# TRADING IS AN ART, NOT A SCIENCE

The markets are largely driven by humans' responses to the information they receive. Not all this information is understandable systematically. Furthermore, the process by which different people interpret the same piece of information is not systematic. If the CEO of a company is fired, is that good news or bad news? One trader might argue that it shows instability at the highest levels of office and is therefore terrible news. Another might say that the CEO deserved to have been fired, it was a situation well handled by the board of directors, and the company is far better off now. Neither can be proven right ex ante. So, critics of quant trading claim, how can anyone believe that you can really model the markets? Their critique is that markets are ultimately driven by humans, and human behavior can't be modeled.

This criticism of quant trading is rather backward, reminiscent of the persecution of scientists such as Galileo and Copernicus for proposing ideas that challenged human authority. Humans have successfully automated and systematized many processes that used to be done by hand, from manufacturing automobiles and flying planes to making markets in stocks. Yes, of course there is still room for humans to make or do various products or services by hand, but when commerce is the main objective, we typically see that the efficiency and consistency of automated processes outweigh the benefit and cachet of doing things manually.

The idea that human behavior cannot be modeled is a bit less easily dismissed, but it is also unlikely to be true. Consider that quantitative techniques are extraordinarily successful for determining what books you might like at Amazon.com, in mining data in customer relationship management software, and in human resources departments seeking to determine which universities produce the best employees. Obviously, as we have already discussed, there is always the risk of trying to get computers to answer questions that shouldn't have been asked of them and of building models that are not good representations of the real world. But in many cases, quant trading included, it is entirely feasible to demonstrate that something humans do with mixed results can be done just as well by computers: to profit from trading the markets.

Indeed, when done well, computerized trading strategies have tended to be exceptional performers over very long periods, as demonstrated by the examples we've used so far (Ed Seykota, Renaissance, Princeton‐Newport Partners, D. E. Shaw, and Two Sigma). In the best cases, models are merely simulations of the real world, not replications. So we cannot expect a quant's models to be perfect, just as we cannot expect Amazon.com to recommend exactly the right book every time. However, over time, a well‐designed quant strategy can predict enough of the behavior of the markets to generate substantial profit for practitioners, as evidenced by the results of some of the quant firms we highlighted in Chapter 2.

# Quants Cause More Market Volatility by Underestimating Risk

This criticism contains components of truth and of falsehood. Many managers, quants included, are subject to a fundamental type of model risk we discussed in the last chapter, namely asking the wrong questions and using the wrong techniques. Techniques such as VaR, for example, make numerous wrong assumptions about the market in an effort to distill the concept of risk down to a single number, which is a goal that itself seems mostly pointless. Furthermore, as illustrated by the August 2007 quant liquidation crisis, quants have underestimated the downside risk of being involved in large‐ scale, crowded trading strategies. This, too, stems from a fundamental flaw of quantitative trading. Computers can be given a problem that is badly framed or makes too many assumptions, and they can come up with an answer that is both highly precise and entirely wrong. For example, I can drum up a model of my wealth that assumes that this book will sell 50 million copies, that I will receive 50 percent of the proceeds, and that I can then invest the proceeds into a vehicle that will earn 100 percent per year, compounded, forever. With this model I can get precise answers to the question of my earnings as far into the future as I want. However, all of my assumptions are highly suspect, at best.

The computer's job is not to judge my assumptions, so this kind of error is ultimately attributable to my poor judgment. Similarly, some quants can be blamed for using quantitative models that are either inappropriate or badly designed to measure risk. That said, they are scarcely alone in making these errors. Indeed, VaR itself was developed to appease risk managers and banking regulators who were interested in having a single number to summarize downside risk, rather than do the difficult and nuanced work of understanding risk from many perspectives. So, though we accept the criticism that quants can underestimate risk or measure it wrongly, it is worth understanding that they are not alone. Decision makers in almost every field commonly manage to underestimate worst‐case scenarios, and when they do not, it is usually to overestimate risk in the aftermath of a disastrous event. This is largely because extreme risks are so rare that it is very difficult to ascertain their probability or the damage they can cause. So, we find that the statement that quants underestimate risk is likely to be true, but we also find this to be due more to human nature and the circumstances of rare events than to something specific in quant trading.

The idea that this underestimation of risk on the part of quants is somehow responsible for an increase in market volatility is, however, plainly ridiculous. First, we have already shown in Chapter 2 that quants tend to reduce market volatility and inefficiency during normal times. Regardless of what happens in abnormal, chaotic times, this fact should not be simply discounted. Second, extreme events have been happening since people could trade with each other. Preliminarily, we can look at extreme events in stocks and other asset classes. There were five distinct drawdowns in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that were worse than 40 percent before quant trading existed (indeed, before there were computers in general use). The worst of these occurred during the Great Depression, which brought with it a drawdown of almost 90 percent in the Dow and which took until 1954 to recover. The last drawdown in stocks before quant trading became a significant force began in January 1973, reached a nadir of –45 percent in December 1974, and was not fully recovered until November 1982. The next severe drawdown in stocks since then was the bear market of March 2000 through October 2002, which was set off by the bursting of the dot‐ com bubble. It is ridiculous to claim that a single one of these events of extreme volatility or prolonged pain was the responsibility of quant traders. The same analysis holds for other asset classes. The worst event in recent history in bonds was Russia's default in 1998. This impacted some "quant" firms (though, as mentioned in Chapter 10, I reject wholesale the idea that LTCM was actually a quant trading firm), but was certainly not caused by quants. The currency problems in Mexico and Asia in 1995 and 1997, respectively, were also not the result of quants' activities. In fact, at the time a rather famous *discretionary* macro trader, George Soros, was widely (though not necessarily correctly) blamed by Asian governments for triggering the latter event.

We can also look at the broader question of how quants are related to market crises from the opposite perspective. How does a crisis in quant trading relate to changes in or levels of market volatility? Since we so far have only one example to work from, we will focus on the events of August 2007. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's historical volatility did move up during the two‐week period in which quants were experiencing pain that summer. However, the Dow's realized volatility moved from a significantly below‐average level to a level that is equal to its average volatility since 1900. From the close of trading on August 3 through August 9, 2007, certainly the worst part of the quant liquidation crisis, the Dow was actually *up* an estimated 1.1 percent—scarcely cause for alarm. Implied volatility, as measured by the VIX index, moved up during this period, from 25.16 to 26.48, but this is by no means a significant change in its level over a four‐day period. It would be an impressive stretch of the imagination to attribute any change in market volatility to quant traders. Indeed, of infinitely greater importance to downside risk in markets and upside swings in volatility levels are policymakers' decisions, exogenous shocks (e.g., wars or terrorist attacks), basic economic cycles, and run‐of‐the‐mill manias and panics. With that, I believe that the extraordinary events of 2008 bear discussion.

#### The Market Turmoil of 2008

While I was writing the first edition of this book in the summer of 2008, the financial world was suffering through its most challenging environment since the Great Depression. Stocks endured their second distinct 40‐plus percent decline in a single decade, and dozens of banks around the world had either gone bankrupt or been nationalized, including two of the five largest U.S. investment banks. Real estate prices crashed in many parts of the world. Several money‐market funds lost all or most of their value. Several of the largest insurance and mortgage companies in the United States were nationalized or required rescuing. The nation of Iceland was effectively bankrupted and actually went to Russia to seek a loan. Record‐setting bailout packages and unprecedented, multinational government‐backing measures were enacted in an attempt to stabilize the financial system, which U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson reportedly told the U.S. Congress was "days from a complete meltdown." Most forms of financial activity, in particular credit, were frozen almost entirely. I raise this example of market turmoil for two reasons: (1) to evaluate whether quants can be blamed for it and (2) to discuss how quants have fared. This is not intended to be a thorough examination of the crisis itself.

It turns out that we can understand a fair amount about what brought us to that precipice: It was caused by irresponsible banks that lent money without proper diligence to unqualified consumers who acted with total disregard to their own financial realities; enabled by ratings agencies that had lost all sense of independence and objectivity; and regulators who ignored or even exacerbated the problem. Dodgy accounting practices, incredible amounts of leverage, extreme greed and recklessness among people who should know better, skewed compensation practices, and lofty egos also played significant roles.

Short sellers and hedge funds were widely blamed for causing the crisis, and indeed, it does appear possible that irresponsible rumor mongering on the Internet might have been partially to blame. (Though I have not seen anyone propose banning the Internet or the kinds of sites that give rumors such wide audiences.) There is no acceptable excuse for those who spread such rumors. But let us be clear and explicit: This was an equally irresponsible attempt to divert attention from the real causes and culprits, many of whom were loudly lobbying for banning short sales and hedge funds.

The facts are unchanged, despite the attempted smokescreen: Many banks did in fact have toxic balance sheets, uncounted and untold billions in losses, and no way to solve the problem. The bailout package passed by Congress in 2008 approved \$700 billion of rescue money, and while that, coupled with the American Recovery Act and the most benign monetary policy in American history, was enough to stem the pace of the collapse, it is clear that the U.S. economy has not come close to a full recovery from this event four years removed from its occurrence. Furthermore, Europe's woes have only recently come into focus, but they are at least equally deep as those in the United States. Even China appears vulnerable lately. In other words, this is one hell of a very real mess, not just a rumor‐driven illusion. Nonetheless, to appease those railing against hedge funds and short sellers, the U.S. SEC banned all short sales of 799 financial stocks from September 19 to October 8, 2008. During this time, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (AMEX: XLF), an exchange‐traded fund (ETF) tracking the financial sector, fell another 23 percent (slightly worse, if we exclude a roughly 1 percent dividend issued during this period). By contrast, one week *after* the ban was lifted and financial companies were again allowed to be sold short, XLF *gained* slightly versus its closing price on October 8.

Quants, according to some, are at least partly to blame for the housing bubble which, when it burst, unleashed all this havoc. How? Nonsensical arguments have been made1 connecting supposedly quant traders like Ken Griffin and Boaz Weinstein to the crisis. These arguments have two major flaws. First, most of those funds that were involved in credit trading are not traded systematically at all. While both Griffin and Weinstein are good at math, their investment strategies are fully discretionary. Secondly, even if we were to call them quants, neither fund's activities in any way precipitated anything associated with the real economic crisis that unfolded in 2008.

It is, in fact, pretty close to inconceivable how anyone could think otherwise. The kinds of credit trading and other arbitrage trading that dominate both Griffin's Citadel and Weinstein's Saba hedge funds are busy looking for trades that take advantage (for example) of mispricings between various tranches of a company's capital structure (equity and various types of debt issuances). The art in these kinds of trades is mostly related to legal and accounting skills, and there is nothing systematic about them whatsoever. Citadel has also made a name buying massively distressed assets, as they did in both the cases of Amaranth and Sowood. Connecting such activities with quant trading is an obvious mistake. But inferring that they were involved in the creation of a crisis is like saying the world is round because California grows good avocados.

Less ridiculous arguments were made about the structured products boom on Wall Street that was far more instrumental in the crisis of 2008. It is clear that many parties were to blame for the credit crisis. The stories of modest income‐earners buying fancy houses with no down payments and no proof of financial wherewithal are well known. Regulators and ratings agencies enabled (and quite possibly ensured) irresponsible lending and borrowing that would power the housing bubble. Here, too, other sources are better than this book on this topic.2 So where do quants come in?

Structured products did play a role in the crisis, making it attractive to lenders to provide loans to utterly unqualified borrowers at massively inflated home values and with little collateral to protect them. This was accomplished by an abuse of the concept of diversification. The thinking was that making one bad loan was a bad idea. But making a huge number of equally bad loans was probably a completely fine idea because, it was infamously assumed, not all those loans would go bad all at once. In other words, those who transact in these securities composed of a bunch of loans were making a convenient, but highly questionable, assumption that there would be no systemic risk that would cause the loans all to go bad at once. How the possibility of a drop in home values or a serious recession was ignored, I'm not sure.

There *is* a tremendous amount of fairly sophisticated mathematics in the determination of the pricing of these securities and analyses of their credit risk.3 The techniques have names like copulas, Lévy models, and saddlepoint approximations. But as I indicated from the very beginning, quant trading has little to do with the financial engineering that drives the creation of structured products, and nothing to do with their promulgation throughout the investment community. Yes, both quant trading and financial engineering utilize mathematics in the field of finance. However, that is the extent of the similarity, and it is a microscopic overlap. Quant traders do not originate securities, show them to ratings agencies, market them to pension funds, and so on. Financial engineers are not responsible for making forecasts of the future movements of various financial instruments, nor for executing trades. Quant traders don't usually have to think about how to value anything: The prices of the instruments they trade are generally knowable with a high degree of certainty, as they are generally extremely liquid and most often exchange traded.

So quants weren't a cause of the credit crisis, but how did they fare through it? In short, better than most. In 2008, many quantitative equity firms struggled, posting losses in the –10 percent range for the year. But a great many quants, using statistical arbitrage, short‐term trading, and even some longer‐term trading strategies, actually made substantial gains. And in other fields of quant trading, 2008 was a banner year. Quantitative commodity trading advisors (CTAs) and short‐term traders in various asset classes, in particular, performed rather well through the crisis. But even if –10 percent was the norm, why should this be considered a particularly bad outcome, especially compared to the alternatives? Stocks have cut investors' money in half *twice* in the past decade. Many large, storied money market funds have gone bust. To my way of thinking, *these* are examples of extremely risky investments, not quant hedge funds. And as just mentioned, it is categorically untrue that quants in general struggled in 2008.

This is also not the first time that quants have demonstrated good performance in turbulent times. In the last two severe market dislocations, in the summer of 1998 and in the bear market of 2000 to 2002, quants again proved to be outperformers. Both periods, in fact, were quite good for a great many quants, with some having the best results in their histories during these times. Even in the crash of October 1987, most quantitative trend‐ following CTAs posted tremendously strong returns. This isn't to say that they are immune from losses or unaffected by market turmoil. The point is that there seems to be an immense double standard applied to quants compared with more traditional markets and even other hedge funds in terms of what is considered risky.

# Quants Cannot Handle Unusual Events or Rapid Changes in Market Conditions

This is perhaps the most valid criticism of quant trading. Quants must rely on historical data to make predictions about the future. As a result of this dependency, it is likely that quants will suffer any time there is a significant and sudden change in the way markets behave. It bears repeating and emphasizing that, in order for the event to be of importance to a quant, the regime change must be both large and without much warning. Perhaps the most challenging time for quant trading in its known history has been the period from late July 2007 through August 2008. Over this roughly 13‐month window, quants (particularly those implementing equity market neutral strategies) faced a liquidity crisis and at least three separate episodes of substantial pain. You can see this illustrated in part in Exhibit 11.1.

As you can see from this figure, Value outperformed Growth from mid‐2004 through early 2007. There was a reversal of this trend beginning in mid‐May 2007, which accelerated aggressively in late July 2007 and was a likely cause of the poor performance among quants that contributed to their liquidation. The trend favoring growth over value from May 2007 to January 2008 is easily seen to be sharper than that which favored value before May 2007. Many quant strategies had adapted to this new regime by the middle of the fall of 2007, leading to strong performance in the later part of that year. But two other periods catch the eye: one in January 2008

![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

Exhibit 11.1 Regime Changes, as Indicated by the Value-Growth Spread

and the other in July 2008, both of which are circled in the chart. These two events were rather violent reversals of the strong trend favoring growth that began in May 2007. These reversals were among the sharpest in the history of this spread, and both were substantial periods of downside risk for many quant traders, particularly those in equities. This is because the prevailing pattern of behavior, on which the quant bases forecasts of future behavior, becomes inverted at such times.

It is worth mentioning that, although the significant majority of quant strategies are negatively impacted by regime changes, a small minority are able to successfully navigate these periods. Some shorter‐term strategies specifically seek to profit from short reversals of longer‐term trends and the resumption of such longer‐term trends. These counter‐trend traders have been able to profit in many of the most difficult periods for quants (but certainly not all of them). Others sit on the sidelines during normal times, waiting for large dislocations to signal the beginning of a potentially profitable trading period. This kind of trading is known as *breakout trading*. Both of these styles can be found in any asset class or instrument class but are most generally done with futures instruments in the most liquid markets.

# Quants Are All the Same

This argument, too, has been widely held to be true, particularly in the wake of the disastrous performance of many quants in August 2007. However, it is a patently false claim, and this I can state with both vehemence and certainty. We will focus again on both theoretical and empirical evidence of this truth, starting with the former.

This book has outlined many of the kinds of decisions each quant must make in the process of building a quant strategy. These decisions include the kinds of instruments and asset classes to trade, the sources of data one will use and how these should be cleaned, ways to research and develop trading strategies, the kinds of phenomena being traded, how these phenomena are specified, ways in which various forecasts are combined, how far into the future forecasts are being made, how bets are structured, ways in which risk is defined and managed, how transaction costs are modeled, how portfolios are constructed, and how trades are executed. The number of degrees of freedom for a quant in building a trading strategy is, in other words, very large. Though the kinds of phenomena are not very numerous, all the other considerations are ways the quant can differentiate his approach from those of others who are ostensibly looking for the same types of anomalies. Depending on the time horizon of the strategy and number of positions it takes, the number of trades per year can easily get into the millions. I know many traders who execute 10,000 to 100,000 trades each trading day. As you can imagine, small differences in how one arrives at a single trade are amplified when millions of trades are made in a year.

The empirical evidence is abundant and covers both position data and return information. At my firm, we have separately managed accounts with both quant and discretionary equity firms. On an average day, 30 percent of the quants' positions are held in *opposite directions* on the exact same names. This belies the notion that quants are all the same, especially since only about 75 percent of their positions are even in the same country. In other words, of the positions held in the same country, about 40 percent are held in opposite directions by various quant traders. As the number of traders is increased, this ratio naturally also increases. This has been confirmed by several studies. In 2008, Matthew Rothman, then of Lehman Brothers, produced a study of 25 of the largest quant equity market neutral traders and found that approximately 30 percent of their positions were held in directions opposite those of someone else in the group, on average, using portfolio data spanning over a year. Among smaller firms, the differences are even more noticeable. With a third to half of all potentially overlapping positions held in opposite directions, it is difficult to accept an argument that quants are all the same. If they were, one quant's long would not be so likely to be another quant's short.

Return data confirm what we see in the position data. I have a sample of a couple of dozen quant managers' daily returns (some going back as far as 1997), and the average correlation of these managers to each other is 0.03. There are only nine pairs of correlations that exceed 0.20, out of 252 pairs in total. And during the heart of the crisis, from September through November 2008, this correlation was merely 0.05. By contrast, the eight HFRX hedge fund indices that have daily returns (i.e., ranging from convertibles to risk arb and macro strategies) correlate at an *average* of 0.21 to each other, and 11 of the 28 pairs correlate at greater than 0.20. Five of the 28 correlate at greater than 0.40, and the maximum correlation is 0.81, between the equity hedge and event‐driven styles.

The same basic story is told by monthly return data. Measuring the correlations of some 53 quant equity market neutral traders with at least 25 months of return history, we find that the average correlation among them is 0.13. Note that we did not even include quantitative futures trading, which would reduce the correlation still further. By contrast, 22 Hedge Fund Research Inc. (HFRI) hedge‐fund‐style indices (excluding the broader HFRI hedge fund and fund of funds indices and excluding the short‐selling managers) correlate at an average of 0.48 to each other, and these span styles as diverse as macro and distressed debt. The data are strongly in opposition to the idea that all quants are the same, confirming what we would expect, given a basic understanding of how quant trading strategies are actually developed.

# Only a Few Large Quants Can Thrive in the Long Run

I've heard this criticism repeated countless times by various observers of the quant trading world. The argument is reasonable enough at first glance, and it goes something like this: The largest and best‐funded quants can throw the most and best resources at every aspect of the black box, from data to execution algorithms, and can negotiate better terms with their service providers. Based on this premise, it is reasonable to expect that, in the long run, they will outperform their smaller cousins. Ultimately, smaller quant firms will fall by the wayside due to either underperformance or investor attrition. The best shops, furthermore, are so good that they ultimately replace their investors' capital with their own, leaving the investor who desires to invest in quant trading in a quandary: Should she select smaller, inferior shops and be able to keep money with them until they go out of business? Is it better to invest in a handful of the biggest quants while that is still possible, and if they kick out their investors later, so be it? Or is it best to simply avoid this space altogether, since the two other options are unattractive?

This criticism and its corollaries are interesting theoretically but ignore many important facts about quant trading and therefore draw an incorrect conclusion. First, as evidenced very clearly in August 2007 and throughout 2008, having a large amount of money to manage is not always good, because readjustments to such large portfolios can be extremely costly in times of stress. In other words, one sacrifices nimbleness while gaining size.

Second, whole classes of very appealing strategies are made impossible or impractical for the largest quants because the amount of money that can be effectively managed in those strategies is too small to be worth the effort. For example, large quants rarely engage in statistical arbitrage in markets such as Australia or Hong Kong because they cannot put enough money to work there. High‐frequency trading in any market has very limited capacity and is therefore a very uncommon component of a large quant trader's portfolio.

Third, there is reasonable evidence that smaller hedge funds actually *outperform* larger funds.3 Some observers believe this is partly because smaller shops are headed by entrepreneurs who are hungry to succeed rather than already successful managers who can become complacent or uninvolved. Regardless, there isn't a particularly good reason to believe that the lack of resources any small trader faces, relative to those who are much larger and trade similar strategies, is any more an impediment for quants than for discretionary traders. As one small discretionary trader put it, "It's not like I'm going to get the first call when a broker has useful information about a company. I just have to work harder and find things on my own." In other words, though there is evidence that smaller managers outperform larger ones, there is no reason to distinguish smaller quants from smaller discretionary shops. Both face challenges that larger shops don't, and both must find ways to cope with them.

Fourth, smaller managers tend to focus on the kinds of things they know and understand best, whereas larger managers need to diversify into areas that are increasingly far from their core expertise in order to grow to such large size. Most very successful trading strategies have somewhat limited capacity for capital under management. As such, to build on success, a larger trader must incorporate other strategies, which might not be at all similar to the ones in which the original success was achieved. This was certainly the case with LTCM and Amaranth; it is also the case with more successful large hedge funds such as D. E. Shaw, Caxton, and Citadel. Some of these have managed a wide diversity of strategies better than others, but the evidence in favor of large multistrategy hedge funds is mixed at best.

Fifth and finally, the vast majority of the quality of a quant strategy is determined by the good judgment and sound research process of the people in charge. Therefore, it is absolutely the case that one good quant, with significant applied science and/or trading experience and sound judgment, is worth dozens of PhDs who lack these traits.

A related point bears mentioning here: Ever since the Industrial Revolution, there has been a trend toward specialization in all variety of businesses. In quant trading, this usually means that the bigger firms tend to hire people with very specific skill sets to fill very specific roles. However, I have seen a great deal of (admittedly anecdotal) evidence that this may be suboptimal. Instead of having a mathematician who doesn't understand software development (or hardware issues, or network optimization) and may not have a great deal of trading expertise or experience, it may be better to have senior partners whose skill sets span multiple areas relevant to quant trading (math, computer science, and finance).

There is often a loss of information that accompanies communication between specialists in one area and specialists in another. It is easy to verify this phenomenon by sitting in any meeting that includes participants of widely varying backgrounds. The jargon is almost always different, the approach to communicating can be different, the assumptions are often different, and, perhaps most importantly, the understanding of what problems can be solved (and what can't be solved) by people in other fields is simply not at a high enough level to maximize the efficiency of communication between specialists of differing fields.

I can distinctly remember my first job in the finance industry as a summer intern in a group that built technology for trading desks. An enormous amount of energy was expended trying to plug the holes in communication between programmers, statisticians, and traders, and this energy was often spent in vain. This is not an indictment of that particular group: It is a well‐known problem endemic to any field that requires expertise from a multitude of disciplines. On the other hand, a great deal of creativity is inspired by the application of techniques from one discipline into another. This is most easily seen in the rise of quant trading itself. Applications of techniques from computer science, physics, statistics, genetics, game theory, engineering, and a huge number of other fields have found their way into the capital markets. Individuals who have expertise in a number of disciplines obviously have an easier time applying techniques across those disciplines.

I have certainly seen firsthand reasonably compelling evidence that a portfolio of boutique quant traders can be built that is productive and competes favorably with a portfolio of larger quant managers. There are also a number of quants who are not among the largest but who certainly have sufficient resources to tackle many of the same advanced problems that the largest shops can consider. For example, the smallest firms most often rely on data vendors, but some small boutiques actually collect and clean their own data, something that it is widely assumed that only the largest firms can do. Both theoretically and empirically, there is little evidence to support the idea that only the largest quants can survive.

This is not to say that the largest firms are without advantages. Those pluses outlined at the beginning of this section are certainly valid, for example. But the case in favor of larger quants is far from airtight, and equally strong arguments can be made for boutiques. The good news is that there are many hundreds of them from which to choose.

In short, we find that there is no substantial difference in quality between smaller and larger quants. There are some larger quant firms that invest their resources into better infrastructure. Others may not. There are some smaller firms that have a great deal of expertise and firepower, despite their size. Others suffer from the lack of resources. We find that it boils down to an evaluation of managers bottom up, and that there is no valid top down evidence that either larger or smaller quants have an advantage over the other. The evaluation of managers is a topic we will save for the next chapter.

# Quants Are Guilty of Data Mining

Data mining is given a fairly bad name in financial circles. It is used interchangeably with another term that is actually deserving of such negative judgment: overfitting. Data mining is an empirical science, to borrow again from the framework of the two major kinds of science we discussed in Chapter 6. Data‐mining techniques are generally understood to use large sets of data for the purpose of deriving information about what happens without worrying about *why* it happens. This is the biggest difference between data mining and theory‐driven science: Theorists are interested in understanding *why* something happens in order to believe that they can correctly forecast *what* will happen. However, as we already learned, theorists, too, look to historical data for clues about what kinds of theories might explain what has happened. This is a fine line—fine enough that it is not entirely clear that there is a valid difference between well‐done empirical science and well‐done theoretical science. The only discernible difference is that, in theoretical science, a human is expected to derive an explanation that seems reasonable to other people, whereas in empirical science, the method of analyzing data is the primary subject of scrutiny. In other words, nearly *everyone* mines data, even if only loosely. This is not problematic. We would not have heard that cheap stocks outperform expensive ones unless someone had some data to support the idea. If the data were overwhelmingly opposed to such a statement, no one would espouse it as a valid approach to investing.

Data mining is very successfully used in many industries in the broader economy and society. In the defense industry, data mining is widely used in terrorism prevention. No doubt you have heard of the U.S. government's efforts to scan millions of phone calls and e‐mails for information to help predict and therefore help stop terrorist attacks. The government does not have individuals sitting on phones listening into each conversation or at computer terminals reading e‐mails. Rather, computer algorithms are used to discern defined patterns that are expected to be fruitful in rooting out potential terrorist activities.

We have already given several other examples of successful data mining in this chapter. Amazon.com uses data mining to advise you of what kinds of books you might like, given what you've purchased and viewed. Analytical customer relationship management (CRM) software packages help businesses maximize profit per contact by mining data on these contacts, to allow sales personnel to focus on the most lucrative clients and spend less time on less lucrative prospects. Human resources departments use data‐ mining tools to discern which universities produce the best employees (the "goodness" of an employee is based on measures of her productivity and quality). Scientists, too, are heavy users of data‐mining techniques. This is particularly evident in the field of genomics, where patterns of genetic information lead to linkages between specific genes and human health and behavior. So, it might not be entirely fair to claim that data‐mining techniques cannot be used on market data, given their wide use and success in so many social and hard sciences. But, perhaps more importantly, as we showed in Chapter 3, most quants *aren't* interested in data‐mining strategies. They are, instead, utilizing strategies based on strong underlying economic principles. Many are very careful about fitting parameters and other aspects of the quant research process that lend themselves to data mining. In short, data mining doesn't deserve as bad a name in finance as it has received, but it's largely a moot point since most quants aren't data mining in the first place.

Overfitting is another story entirely. *Over*fitting a model implies that the researcher has attempted to extract too much information from the data. With a sufficiently complex model, it is possible to explain the past perfectly. But what is the likelihood that a perfect explanation of the past, using an overly complex model, will have any relevance to the future? It turns out that the answer is: not bloody likely. Imagine that we find out that the S&P 500 dropped an average of 1 percent anytime the Federal Reserve announced a decision during some period. But we have only a handful of observations of the Fed making announcements, and all their announcements during the historical period were of the Fed announcing rate *hikes*. We could, if we were overfitting, draw a conclusion that Fed announcements are always bad, and this conclusion would be successful so long as future Fed announcements are met with the same reaction as past announcements. But what happens if the next Fed announcement is of a lowering of interest rates? It's very likely the strategy would lose money because it was fitted to a sample that primarily included rate hikes. Therefore, we should be concerned about overfitting the data.

As an experiment, I set up a new Amazon.com account and idly clicked on a handful of books of interest to me. The recommendations that came back were not nearly as good as those that I'm given from my main Amazon.com account, since my main account is based on a lot of real data, whereas the new account is based on information from fewer than 20 observations of my clicking on various titles. The recommendations in my new account are likely to be overfitted, whereas those in my old account are less likely to be overfitted.

To estimate a given parameter of a model, one needs rather a lot of data. Overfitting ignores this basic fact and burdens a limited supply of data too much, asking it to explain more than is realistic, given the amount of data. These models are finely tuned to the past, but the moment that the future is out of step with the past, the model breaks down. In quant finance, the inevitable outcome of overfitting is losing money. There is no question that, when it is found, overfitting should be eliminated. But it is a gross and incorrect generalization that all quants overfit their models. Those most likely to be guilty of overfitting are data‐mining quants. And among data‐mining strategies, I find that a useful rule of thumb is that shorter timescales tend to be more amenable to data mining than longer timescales.

First, this might be because there are so many more observations of trades at short time horizons, and therefore the amount of data available for analysis is increased. If a strategy holds positions for a year, on average, it would take hundreds of years to be comfortable with any substantial statistical analysis of the strategy's returns, because the number of betting periods is so small. If, by contrast, a strategy trading U.S. stocks holds its positions for one minute, there are 390 trading periods per day (because there are 390 minutes per trading day) and about 100,000 trading periods per year (because there are 250 to 260 trading days per year and 390 minutes per trading day) per stock. If 1,000 stocks are traded, there are about 100 million trading periods per year to observe, yielding a great deal more data that can be mined. Remember, the problem of overfitting arises when the model is too complicated for the amount of data available. The more data are made available, the less likely it is that overfitting has occurred for a given level of model complexity.

Second, at very short timescales it is not clear that theoretical scientists have yet come up with useful explanations of behavior. A practical guideline is that, for strategies with holding periods of less than a day, data‐mining strategies might be fairly useful. For strategies with holding periods on the order of a week, a hybrid approach that combines data‐mining techniques and sound market theory can be useful. Finally, strategies that expect to hold positions for months or years are not likely to work if they rely on data‐mining techniques.

Overfitting models is not only possible, it actually happens among some quant traders. But just as we do not reject analysis because some people are prone to overanalyzing things, we should not so quickly dismiss quantitative modeling (even data mining) just because it is possible (or even easy) for some people to do it badly.

# Summary

Quant trading is no elixir, and certainly there are quants who are guilty of each or all of the criticisms discussed in this chapter. Some do bad science, underestimate risk, and lose money when market conditions change suddenly. Some implement strategies that are commonplace and crowded, and some overfit their models to limited amounts of data. But most of these criticisms are equally applicable to discretionary traders. Done well, quant trading can produce superior risk‐adjusted returns and substantial diversification benefits.

So, what does it mean to do quant trading well? We will cover this topic in depth in the next chapter, but let's recap some salient points from this chapter: Quants must be concerned with falling prey to the temptation of false precision, particularly in risk management. A printout with a risk number on it does not imply that the number is accurate or has been properly derived. Quants must also remain aware of relationships within the market and must have a detailed understanding of the kinds of bets they are making and how they are expressing these bets in their portfolios, allowing them to navigate violent regime changes. Quants must conduct innovative research in alpha modeling and across the entire spectrum of the black box, to reduce the risk that there is substantial overlap between their models and those of their peers. Finally, to the extent that data mining is explicitly utilized, it should be done in a manner that does not express overconfidence in the amount and predictive power of historical data.
