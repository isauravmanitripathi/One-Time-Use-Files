CHAPTER 2

# An Introduction to **Quantitative Trading**

You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: You send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.

-Attributed to Albert Einstein, when asked to explain the radio

The term *black box* conjures up images of a Rube Goldberg device in which some simple input is rigorously tortured to arrive at a mysterious and distant output. Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines a Rube Goldberg device as "accomplishing by extremely complex roundabout means what actually or seemingly could be done simply." Many observers in both the press and industry use markedly similar terms to describe quants. One *Washington Post* article, "For Wall Street's Math Brains, Miscalculations; Complex Formulas Used by 'Quant' Funds Didn't Add Up in Market Downturn," contains the following definition: "A quant fund is a hedge fund that relies on complex and sophisticated mathematical algorithms to search for anomalies and non-obvious patterns in the markets."<sup>1</sup> In the New York Post's "Not So Smart Now," we learn that "Quant funds run computer programs that buy and sell hundreds and sometimes thousands of stocks simultaneously based on complex mathematical ratios...."<sup>2</sup> Perhaps most revealing, this view is held even by some of the world's best-respected investors. David Swensen, the renowned chief investment officer of the \$17 billion Yale University endowment fund and author of *Pioneering Portfolio Management*, said in an interview with Fortune/CNN Money, "We also don't invest in quantitativeblack box models because we simply don't know what they're doing."<sup>3</sup>

The term *black box* itself has somewhat mysterious origins. From what I can tell, its first known use was in 1915 in a sci‐fi serial called *The Black Box*, starring Herbert Rawlinson. The program was about a criminologist named Sanford Quest who invented devices (which themselves were placed inside a black box) to help him solve crimes. Universal Studios, which produced the serial, offered cash prizes to those who could guess the contents of the black box.4

This connotation of opaqueness still persists today whenever the term *black box* is used. Most commonly in the sciences and in finance, a black box refers to any system that is fed inputs and produces outputs, but whose inner workings are either unknown or unknowable. Appropriately, two favorite descriptors for quant strategies are *complex* and *secretive*. However, by the end of this book I think it will be reasonably obvious to readers that, for the most part, quantitative trading strategies are in fact *clear* boxes that are far easier to understand in most respects than the caprice inherent to most human decision making.

For example, an esoteric‐sounding strategy called *statistical arbitrage* is in fact simple and easily understood. Statistical arbitrage (stat arb) is based on the theory that similar instruments (imagine two stocks, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron) should behave similarly. If their relative prices diverge over the short run, they are likely to converge again. So long as the stocks are still similar, the divergence is more likely due to a short‐term imbalance between the amount of buying and selling of these instruments, rather than any meaningful fundamental change that would warrant a divergence in prices. This is a clear and straightforward premise, and it drives billions of dollars' worth of trading volumes daily. It also happens to be a strategy that discretionary traders use, though it is usually called *pairs trading*. But whereas the discretionary trader is frequently unable to provide a curious investor with a consistent and coherent framework for determining when two instruments are similar or what constitutes a divergence, these are questions that the quant has likely researched and can address in great detail.

## What Is a Quant?

A *quant* systematically applies an alpha‐seeking investment strategy that is specified based on exhaustive research. What makes a quant a quant, in other words, almost always lies in *how* an investment strategy is conceived and implemented. It is rarely the case that quants are different from discretionary traders in *what* their strategies are actually doing, as illustrated by the earlier example of pairs trading and statistical arbitrage. There is almost never any attempt to eliminate human contributions to the investment process; after all, we are talking about quants, not robots. As previously mentioned, although quants apply mathematics and/or computer science to a wide variety of strategies, whether a fund designed to track the S&P 500 (i.e., an index fund) or to structure exotic products (e.g., asset‐backed securities, credit default swaps, or principal protection guarantee notes), this book will remain focused on quants who pursue *alpha*, or returns that are independent of the direction of any market in the long run.

Besides conceiving and researching the core investment strategy, humans also design and build the software and systems used to automate the implementation of their ideas. But once the system "goes live," human judgment is generally limited in the day‐to‐day management of a portfolio. Still, the importance of human discretion in such a setup should not be understated. Good judgment is actually what separates the best quants from the mediocre. The kinds of issues listed in the stat arb example are just a small subset of the kinds of decisions that quants almost always have to make, and these fundamental decisions, above all else, drive the strategy's behavior from that time forward. As such, good and bad judgments are multiplied over and over through time as the computer faithfully implements exactly what it was told to do. This is no different from many other fields. Imagine a guided missile system. If the engineers make bad judgments in the way they design these systems, there can be disastrous results, which are multiplied as more missiles are fired using the faulty guidance systems.

To understand the systematic nature of quants better, it can be helpful to examine the frontiers of the systematic approach—in other words, the situations in which quants have to *abandon* a systematic approach for a discretionary one. When a quant intervenes with the execution of her strategy, it is most commonly to mitigate problems caused by information that drives market behavior but that cannot be processed by the model. For example, the 2008 merger between Merrill Lynch and Bank of America, which caused Merrill's price to skyrocket, might have led a naïve quant strategy to draw the conclusion that Merrill had suddenly become drastically overpriced relative to other banks and was therefore an attractive candidate to be sold short. But this conclusion would have been flawed because there was information that justified the spike in Merrill's price and would not seem to a reasonable person to lead to a short sale. As such, a human can step in and simply remove Merrill from the universe that the computer models see, thereby eliminating the risk that, in this case anyway, the model will make decisions based on bad information. In a sense, this is merely an application of the principle of "garbage in, garbage out." If a portfolio manager at a quant trading shop is concerned that the model is making trading decisions based on inaccurate, incomplete, or irrelevant information, she may decide to reduce risk by eliminating trading in the instruments affected by this information.

Note that in this example, the news of the merger would already have been announced before the quant decides to override the system. Some shops are more aggressive, preemptively pulling names off the list of tradable securities at the first sign of credible rumors. By contrast, other quants do not remove names under any circumstances. Many quants reserve the right to reduce the overall size of the portfolio (and therefore leverage) if, in their discretion, the markets appear too risky. For example, after the attacks of September 11, 2001, many quants reduced their leverage in the wake of a massive event that would have unknowable repercussions on capital markets. Once things seemed to be operating more normally in the markets, the quants increased their leverage back to normal levels.

Though the operating definition of quants at the beginning of this section is useful, there is a full spectrum between *fully discretionary* strategies and *fully systematic* (or *fully automated*) strategies. The key determination that puts quants on one side of this spectrum and everyone else on the other is whether daily decisions about the selection and sizing of portfolio positions are made systematically (allowing for the exceptions of "emergency" overrides such as those just described) or by discretion. If both the questions of *what positions* to own and *how much* of each to own are usually answered systematically, that's a quant. If either one is answered by a human as standard operating procedure, that's not a quant.

It is interesting to note that, alongside the growth in quantitative trading, there are also a growing number of *quasi‐quant* traders. For instance, some of these traders utilize automated systems to screen for potential investment opportunities, thereby winnowing a large number of potential choices down to a much smaller, more manageable list. From there, human discretion kicks in again, doing some amount of "fundamental" work to determine which names selected by the systematic screening process are actually worth owning and which are not. Less commonly, some traders leave the sourcing and selection of trades entirely up to humans, instead using computers to optimize and implement portfolios and to manage risk. Still less commonly, a few traders allow the computer to pick all the trades, while the human trader decides how to allocate among these trades. These quasi‐quants make use of a subset of the tools in a proper quant's toolbox, so we will cover their use of these techniques implicitly.

## What Is the Typical Structure of a Quantitative Trading System?

The best way to understand both quants and their black boxes is to examine the components of a quant trading system; this is the structure we will use for the remainder of the book. Exhibit 2.1 shows a schematic of a typical quantitative trading system. This diagram portrays the components of a live, "production" trading strategy (e.g., the components that decide which securities to buy and sell, how much, and when) but does not include everything necessary to create the strategy in the first place (e.g., research tools for designing a trading system).

The trading system has three modules—an alpha model, a risk model, and a transaction cost model—which feed into a portfolio construction model, which in turn interacts with the execution model. The alpha model is designed to predict the future of the instruments the quant wants to consider trading for the purpose of generating returns. For example, in a trend‐ following strategy in the futures markets, the alpha model is designed to forecast the direction of whatever futures markets the quant has decided to include in his strategy.

Risk models, by contrast, are designed to help limit the amount of exposure the quant has to those factors that are unlikely to generate returns but could drive losses. For example, the trend follower could choose to limit his directional exposure to a given asset class, such as commodities, because of concerns that too many forecasts he follows could line up in the same direction, leading to excess risk; the risk model would contain the levels for these commodity exposure limits.

The transaction cost model, which is shown in the box to the right of the risk model in Exhibit 2.1, is used to help determine the cost of whatever trades are needed to migrate from the current portfolio to whatever new portfolio is desirable to the portfolio construction model. Almost any trading transaction costs money, whether the trader expects to profit greatly or a little from the trade. Staying with the example of the trend follower, if a

trend is expected to be small and last only a short while, the transaction cost model might indicate that the cost of entering and exiting the trade is greater than the expected profits from the trend.

The alpha, risk, and transaction cost models then feed into a portfolio construction model, which balances the trade‐offs presented by the pursuit of profits, the limiting of risk, and the costs associated with trading, thereby determining the best portfolio to hold. Having made this determination, the system can compare the current portfolio to the new target portfolio, with the differences between the current portfolio and the target portfolio representing the trades that need to be executed. Exhibit 2.2 illustrates an example of this process.

The current portfolio reflects the positions the quant trader currently owns. After running the portfolio construction model, the quant trader generates the new target portfolio weights, shown in the New Target Portfolio column. The difference between the two indicates the trades that now need to be executed, which is the job of the execution algorithm. The execution algorithm takes the required trades and, using various other inputs such as the urgency with which the trades need to be executed and the dynamics of the liquidity in the markets, executes trades in an efficient and low‐cost manner.

The structure shown in Exhibit 2.1 is by no means universal. For example, many quant strategies are run without a transaction cost model, a portfolio construction model, or an execution model. Others combine various components of these models. One can build whatever risk requirements and constraints are considered necessary into the alpha model itself. Another variation is to create more recursive connections among the pieces. Some traders capture data about their actual executions and utilize these data to improve their transaction cost models. However, the diagram is useful because, for the most part, it captures the various discrete functions within a quant trading system, regardless of whether they are organized precisely in this manner.

|                                | Current Portfolio | New Target Portfolio | Trades to Execute |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| S&P 500 Index                  | Short 30%         | Short 25%            | Buy to Cover 5%   |
| EUROSTOXX<br>Index             | Long 20%          | Long 25%             | Buy 5%            |

exhibit 2.3 The Black Box Revealed

Exhibit 2.1 captures only part of the work of the quant trader because it considers only the live production trading system and ignores two key pieces required to build it and run it: data and research. Black boxes are inert and useless without data—accurate data, moreover. Quant traders build input/ output models that take inputs (data), process this information, and then produce trading decisions. For example, a trader utilizing a trend‐following strategy usually requires price data to determine what the trend is. Without data, he would have nothing to do, because he'd never be able to identify the trends he intends to follow. As such, data are the lifeblood of quants and determine much about their strategies. Given data, quants can perform research, which usually involves some form of testing or simulation. Through research, the quant can ascertain whether and how a quant strategy works. We also note that each of the other modules in our schematic, when built correctly, usually requires a great deal of research. We can therefore redraw our diagram to include these other critical pieces, as shown in Exhibit 2.3.

## Summary

Quants are perhaps not so mysterious as is generally supposed. They tend to start with ideas that any reasonable observer of the markets might also have, but rather than using anecdotal, experiential evidence—or worse, simply assuming that their ideas are true—quants use market data to feed a research process to determine whether their ideas in fact hold true over time. Once quants have arrived at a satisfactory strategy, they build their strategy into a quant system. These systems take the emotion out of investing and instead impose a disciplined implementation of the idea that was tested. But this should not be read as minimizing the importance of human beings in the quant trading process. Quants come up with ideas, test strategies, and decide which ones to use, what kinds of instruments to trade, at what speed, and so on. Humans also tend to control a "panic button," which allows them to reduce risk if they determine that markets are behaving in some way that is outside the scope of their models' capabilities.

Quant strategies are widely ignored by investors as being opaque and incomprehensible. Even those who do focus on this niche tend to spend most of their time understanding the core of the strategy, its alpha model. But we contend that there are many other parts of the quant trading process that deserve to be understood and evaluated. Transaction cost models help determine the correct turnover rate for a strategy, and risk models help keep the strategy from betting on the wrong exposures. Portfolio construction models balance the conflicting desires to generate returns, expend the right amount on transaction costs, manage risk, and deliver a target portfolio to execution models, which implement the portfolio model's decisions. All this activity is fed by data and driven by research. From afar, we have begun to shed light on the black box.

Next, in Part Two, we will dissect each of these modules, making our way methodically through the inside of the black box. At the end of each of these chapters, as a reminder of the structure of a quant system and of our progress, we will indicate the topic just completed by removing the shading from it.
