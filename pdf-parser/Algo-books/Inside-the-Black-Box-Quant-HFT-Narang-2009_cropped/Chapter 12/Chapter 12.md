# Evaluating Quants and Quant Strategies

*. . . talent means nothing, while experience, acquired in humility and with hard work, means everything.*

— Patrick Süskind

I n this chapter we discuss methods of assessing quant strategies and practitioners to separate the good from the mediocre and the mediocre from the poor. As I have said throughout this book, a great deal of the work that quants do has very natural analogues in discretionary trading. There are also significant parallels in the work of a quant trader to the work of a corporate CEO or any other person involved in the allocation of resources. In this regard, the framework presented in this chapter can be used successfully to judge the work of such decision makers. Indeed, one person I trained in this method of assessing quants has adapted it for trading credit markets and now uses the same method to provide a framework for judging the merit of various corporate bond offerings and the companies behind them.

The first challenge an evaluator of quants faces is to pierce the walls of secrecy that quants build around their methods. Though it is fair to say that quants are often secretive, I have had a rather different experience. The vast majority of quants I have evaluated—and there have been many hundreds of them—have been willing to answer most or all of my innumerable questions. The difference is due, at least in part, to the questions we ask at my firm. It also owes to how we ask these questions and how we handle the information we learn from quants. In the next section, I describe the principles of my approach to interviewing quants.

Armed with the techniques described in this chapter, the evaluator of a quant has two goals. The first is to understand the strategy itself, including the kinds of risks it is taking and from what sources its returns are generated. This is important because it tells the investor what she owns when she is investing in a given quant strategy. The second goal in the evaluation of a quant is to judge how good the practitioners themselves are. In many respects, a quant trading team is much like an engineering team at an automobile manufacturer. It is fine for the team to build one great engine, but over time, that engine must be improved. As times change, the engine might even need to be redesigned entirely, or other types of engines might need to be designed for other vehicles. It is critical to ascertain whether the quant team is skilled at designing engines, evolving them, and designing new types of engines over time. All these components of the analysis of a quant ultimately serve to help the evaluator answer perhaps the most central question in the evaluation of any kind of trader: Why should I believe that this particular team, utilizing this particular strategy, is actually likely to make money in the future? In hedge fund parlance, what is this manager's *edge*?

Assuming that the investor finds a team and strategy worthy of investment, he must ascertain the integrity of the people involved. After all, skill is a good thing only if it is in the hands of good people. Here I briefly address some thoughts on how to judge the integrity of a trader, although this is not central to quantitative trading. Finally, I provide a few brief thoughts on portfolio construction using the frameworks provided in this book.

# Gathering Information

How does one actually go about finding out what a particular quant does? Quants are notorious for their secrecy and paranoia. And this is not without reason. Much of the skill of quant trading comes from experience and know‐how, not from raw mathematical superiority. There is an excellent book called *The Interrogator,* by Raymond Toliver, from which many useful lessons can be learned on how to get information from a quant.1 The book's subject is Hanns Joachim Scharff, a former World War II Luftwaffe interrogator who succeeded at gathering information from downed Allied pilots without the use of any physical force or psychologically stressful techniques. Instead, Scharff used three major tools: trust building, domain knowledge, and an organized system for tracking and retrieving information.

Before detailing Scharff's techniques, I want to stress that I am no fan of wars or interrogations, nor does the relationship between investor and quant manager closely resemble the relationship between interrogator and prisoner. But there is one similarity, I believe, that allows lessons from the latter to be useful in the former: In both cases, information that one party is reluctant to provide is needed by the other.

The first technique Scharff used is also the most obvious: He built trust with the pilots he was interviewing. In fact, Scharff remained friends with a great many of them after the war, and they seemed universally to respect and like him. Turning to the quant, trust comes in part from building relationships, but a big chunk of it relates to the behavior of the interviewer. If an investor asks a quant for sensitive information and has either a reputation for talking, or an actual propensity to talk about what other quants do, it is less likely that the quant will or should trust this investor. After all, whatever the quant tells him is likely to get spread around the industry. At my firm, we hold quant managers' strategies in the strictest confidence. Often a quant will ask us what some other quant does. Our answer is universally and always that we will not discuss what others do, just as we do not discuss what the quant who asked us does. However, we've heard numerous stories and witnessed numerous firsthand examples of investors or managers passing along even reasonably proprietary bits and pieces of a quant's strategy to the industry. This is an ugly practice.

The second lesson from *The Interrogator* is that it is hard to feel particularly justified in being secretive with information if the person asking questions already knows most of the possible answers. For example, Scharff knew the name of the pet dog at the home base of one pilot and the names of most of the pilot's colleagues. His goal in a given interview was to learn just a little bit more about his prisoners and their activities. They were frequently lulled into thinking that there was no point in keeping secrets, since their captor knew so much already. Though this never led to blatant tell‐all behavior, it certainly allowed the interrogator to amass huge amounts of value from the interviews, a little at a time. It is possible to learn a similarly voluminous amount about quant trading without asking any particular quant to teach it to you in a meeting. This is helped along by the fact that most of what an investor needs to understand about a quant can be learned without compromising proprietary information. In this book, for example, we have outlined a great majority of the kinds of approaches quants use. None of this information is especially proprietary to any trader. A quant with any hope of being successful knows most of the material in this book already. In a sense, this book provides you with a great portion of the menu available to a quant. There aren't many dishes he can choose that aren't on this menu, which obviates the need for most of the secrecy. The investor can, in this way, learn about the specific items on the menu that the quant being interviewed has chosen and why these choices were made. For instance, understanding the kinds of alpha models the quant is using, whether they are relative or intrinsic, how fast he trades, and in what instruments and geographies tells the investor a great deal about what risks are being taken. This information is necessary for building a diversified portfolio and is largely sufficient for that exercise.

The third and final lesson of *The Interrogator* is to be organized in the management of information when it is gathered. This greatly supports efforts to get new information but is also useful in ongoing evaluations of the quality of a given practitioner. Scharff's group developed a sophisticated, almost relational database system using index cards and a card catalogue file. (Remember, this was before the computer was invented.) As they got new information, they would organize it by linking it to other relevant cards in the file. For example, if they found out the name of another pilot from a given American base, they would tag that card with references to all the other information, including other pilots, from that base. This way, as they were interviewing a given pilot, they had a dossier that contained an impressive and extensive array of details, well organized and easy to access. These days we have powerful computers and databases to rely on, making such a job easier.

Keeping information organized furthers the goal of developing deep domain knowledge, but it is also quite useful in ascertaining the "goodness" of a quant team over time. If every three months you ask a quant, for example, what types of research projects he is working on and what new pieces he has added to the model over the past three months, over time you should see a rational life cycle that repeatedly takes a robust research pipeline and turns it into implemented improvements to the strategy. If the quant has a process wherein modules that were not part of the research list from the past suddenly appear in production, this could be evidence of sloppiness in the research process. When visiting a quant's office, it is useful to ask to see firsthand some of the various tools and software that the quant claimed to use or to have developed in previous discussions. But, even to know that you should be asking to see something specific, you already had to have carefully managed the information about the nature of these tools and software.

# Evaluating a Quantitative Trading Strategy

In my years of evaluating and creating quant trading strategies, I have noted an extraordinarily interesting fact: The work that a quant does is, in most ways, identical to the work that any portfolio manager, any CEO, or any other allocator of resources must perform. After all, these resources (e.g., time or money) are limited and must be invested in a way that results in maximum benefit. The process used to invest resources—the investment process—contains six major components:

- **1.** Research and strategy development
- **2.** Data sourcing, gathering, cleaning, and management

- **3.** Investment selection and structuring
- **4.** Portfolio construction
- **5.** Execution
- **6.** Risk management and monitoring

You may note that these activities are closely parallel to the modules of the black box and the activities in and around its construction and management. This is because all these areas must be addressed in order for a quant trading program to function properly over time. One fact about computers, which we've mentioned already, is that they do not do a good job of thinking about things you might have missed. As quant trading programs have evolved over time, they have had to address the myriad decisions that any portfolio manager must address. Too often, in discretionary management activities, important aspects of this process are left without sufficient analysis, and an ad hoc approach is taken. I've interviewed scores of discretionary stock pickers who can spin tremendous yarns about why they are long this stock or short another. But when asked how they decide how to size these positions in their portfolios, the answers are often vacuous, given without deep thought or analysis.

Those charged with evaluating managers must thoroughly examine each of these areas. And quants, in general, should be willing to answer questions about each. A few examples of the kinds of questions I ask a quant follow:

- Research and strategy development
  - How do you come up with new ideas for trading strategies?
  - How do you test these ideas?
  - What is your approach to fitting the model, as well as your approach to in‐sample and out‐of‐sample testing?
  - What kinds of things are you looking for to determine whether a strategy works or not?
- Data sourcing, gathering, cleaning, and management
  - What data are you using?
  - How do you store the data, and why that way?
  - How do you clean the data?
- Investment selection and structuring
  - Can you describe the theory behind your alphas?
  - Which types of alpha are you using (e.g., trend, reversion, technical sentiment, value/yield, growth, or quality)?
  - Are you making relative bets or directional bets?
  - If relative, what does relative mean, exactly?
  - Over what time horizon, and in what investment universe, do you apply your alpha model?

- How are you mixing your various alpha models?
- Portfolio construction
  - How do you do portfolio construction, which is to say, how do you size your positions?
  - Are there limits, and why did you set them that way?
  - What are the inputs to your portfolio construction model?
  - What are you trying to achieve with portfolio construction (i.e., what is your "objective function")?
- Execution
  - What kind of transaction cost model are you using, and why did you choose to model transaction costs the way you did?
  - How are you executing trades—manually or algorithmically?
  - Tell me about your order execution algorithms: What kinds of things did you build into them (e.g., hidden vs. visible, or active vs. passive)?
- Risk management and monitoring
  - What does your risk model account for, and why those things?
  - What are your various risk limits, and why did you set them where you did?
  - Under what circumstances would you ever intervene with your model?
  - What are you monitoring about your strategy on an ongoing basis?

This is but a sampling of the hundreds of questions I ask a quant. If he claims that the answers to such questions are proprietary, I do not simply accept that response. Rather, I try to ascertain *why* he thinks the answers are proprietary and try to make him understand *why* I need to know. Most quants I have met are sympathetic to the goals of an investor trying to understand whether that trader's approach and the commensurate exposures that it yields are beneficial to the investor's portfolio's exposures and whether the quant is skilled at his work. In other words, the overall justifications for all the questions one needs to ask about a systematic trading strategy are as follows. First, the investor must understand what the strategy is, in order to ascertain whether it is desirable for his portfolio to be exposed to the strategy's risks. Second, the investor must ascertain whether the manager implementing the strategy is actually doing it well enough to deserve an allocation of capital, which we address in the next section. Success in the endeavor of evaluating quants ultimately is driven by building trust, having domain knowledge, and being organized in the management of information. As I've said, the menu of things that quants can choose to do is reasonably easy to know. It is largely laid out in this book, and I am certain I've revealed nothing proprietary. A quant generally should not claim that he cannot disclose which items he has chosen from this menu.

The investor has one more tool available for understanding a quant strategy, and that is the footprint left behind by the strategy: its return history. Imagine that an investor learns, by asking questions such as those I've listed, that a quant is using a trend‐following strategy on various individual instruments, with a six‐month average holding period. When long‐term trends are present, the strategy should do well. When longer‐term trends reverse, the investor should see the strategy do poorly. In other words, the strategy's return pattern should corroborate the fundamental understanding that the investor has gained by asking many questions.

# Evaluating the Acumen of Quantitative Traders

If I have tried to stress anything in this book, it is that the judgment of a quant trader pervades the strategy she builds. So, an evaluation of the quant's skill and experience in the fields relevant to the trading strategy is obviously important, but it is also easier said than done. This section outlines a few tools that can be used to determine the skill level of quant traders.

The people developing and managing quant strategies should be well trained in the methods they use. At least some members of the team should have substantial live experience in areas of quant trading relevant to the strategy they are currently pursuing. Experience helps drive good judgment, especially in light of the massive array of subtleties and traps inherent in the process of research and trading. From a dispositional standpoint, quants should be careful and cautious in their analysis, and they must be humble about their ability to predict the future. There are considerable hurdles to doing quant trading well, such as polluted data and constantly improving competition. A good quant does not underestimate such challenges, nor does she overestimate her ability to meet them. The reality is, however, that evaluating whether scientists know what they are talking about at a deep level is not the easiest task for someone who is not technically proficient. As such, to make a judgment, one may have to rely on the quant's qualifications and experience, reputation, history of success, and analyses of the investment process. Although this is a lot of work, the task is doable for those who want to undertake it.

One of the handiest tricks I know of to evaluate a quant's skill is to dig deeply into the details in a few areas of her process. Why? The difference between success and failure is very commonly found in a large number of highly detailed decisions. If the mechanism used to make these decisions is flawed, the manager has little hope of success in the long run. Thus, an analysis of the investment process, and by extension its six major components, is focused on understanding *what* a quant does and, just as important, *why* the quant does it. As we discussed throughout this book, a number of approaches to quant trading can deliver acceptable risk‐adjusted returns. Momentum and mean reversion strategies can both work, even though they are opposites. Both intrinsic alphas and relative alphas can work. So it is important to understand what a trader does, but why she does it tells you about her judgment, her process, and her potential for future success.

Each decision a quant makes in how she builds a strategy represents a source of potential differentiation from other traders, but also of potential success or failure. And it makes sense that this should be the case. Many quants have large numbers of positions, frequently in the thousands, and most engage in strategies that turn these positions over relatively frequently—from once every few minutes to once every few months. If 5,000 positions are turned over once a week, for example, this represents about 260,000 individual trades per year. Now imagine two equity traders, Trader A and Trader B. They have remarkably similar strategies, even in the details, and they each manage \$500 million. For each dollar managed, they put on \$2 of long positions and \$2 of short positions so that each trader has a portfolio of \$2 billion. Each turns over about 20 percent of her portfolio per day, or \$400 million in dollar volume each day. They each average 10 percent returns per year. If Trader A is later able to optimize her executions such that she makes 0.01 percent more per dollar traded than she used to—either by being faster or reducing transaction costs or improving the alpha model this results in Trader A's annual return improving to 12 percent per year. This is 20 percent, or \$10 million per year in profits, better than the result generated by Trader B, which is an enormous difference when compounded over time. Though some quants certainly do things that are plainly incorrect at a high level, the judgment of the quality of a given quant most often comes down to her decisions at a fairly detailed level.

Another reason that the details matter so much is that there is really only a tiny amount of predictability in all the movements of the market. Quants often depend on being right only slightly more often than they are wrong and/or on making only slightly more on winning trades than they lose on losing trades in order to generate profits (though trend-following futures strategies tend to lose as much as 70 percent of the time, with dramatically larger payoffs on the winners than the losses suffered on the losers). As such, small decisions that affect the probability of winning only slightly or those that skew the size of winning trades versus losing trades slightly can dramatically impact the outcome over time.

Finally, if the quant has given deep and well‐grounded thought to the details of the few areas that you spot‐check, it is more likely that she has given deep thought to other areas of the quant trading process. This, too, improves her probability of success in the future, since we have shown that rigor is a key component of success in quant trading. Though it is likely obvious enough already, I want to make it clear that the fact that a quant has a PhD in physics (or anything else) is no indication of quality or skill. Some of the brightest and most successful quants have no advanced degrees, and some of the biggest failures in quant trading have won Nobel Prizes.

The flaw in this plan of focusing on the details of a quant strategy is that such details are unlikely to be revealed to an investor during due diligence. Though the higher‐level topics discussed in the section entitled "Evaluating a Quantitative Trading Strategy" might be relatively uncontroversial to discuss, the details are not. As I mentioned earlier, it is frequently the details that separate the best traders from the mediocre ones, and these details often boil down to know‐how more than, say, better math skills. So, quants are and probably should be somewhat more reticent to provide such details. Even if they were to provide details, the investor would have to be knowledgeable and proficient enough to pass judgment on them. In other words, to try to divine the quality of a quant's system from clues about its particulars requires significant experience on the part of the quant investor. After all, just as I require experience in my traders, I also benefit from experience in judging them. A great many things that seem plausible enough at first glance simply don't work. For example, just because a quant pays a lot of money to a data vendor for clean data, it doesn't mean that the quant should actually rely on the cleanliness of that data. The saving grace for the nonquantitative investor seeking to evaluate a quant is thoroughness and strong information management in the assessment and due‐diligence process.

# The Edge

In assessing a portfolio manager, including a quant, a key issue to focus on is the idea of an *edge*. We define an edge as that which puts the odds in favor of the portfolio manager succeeding. An edge can come from three sources, listed here in order of commonness:

- **1.** The investment process
- **2.** A lack of competition
- **3.** Something structural

In investing and trading, an edge is *not* the same thing as a competitive edge. A trader might have absolutely no competitors, yet still manage to lose money. I've seen it more than once. An investment edge is thus more intrinsic than comparative. Still, competition does matter: A valid idea with a valid implementation might make little or no money if there is too much competition, whereas a mediocre strategy might make money if there is none. As such, one must ascertain the sustainability of a given trader's edge. The odds might be in the trader's favor today but against him tomorrow as the world changes or as competition increases, if the trader does not evolve.

An *investment process edge* must come from one or more of the six components of the investment process we just outlined. Too often, when asking a discretionary stock picker what his edge is, we hear him say, "Stock picking." But this is merely an invocation of the activity, not evidence that this particular trader is any good at it. One must dig further into the *reason* that the trader claims to have an edge in any of these activities. For quant traders, most often an investment edge comes from experience and skill in conducting research and/or the acquisition or cleaning of data. This is because the goodness of the models for investment selection and structuring, portfolio construction, execution, and risk management is usually determined by the quality of the research and development process that created them. If some modules have not been particularly well researched, there is almost no chance that the trader will have an edge in these areas. An edge in research can derive from superiority in talent or process, but actual experience in conducting successful research in the financial markets is usually critical. In other words, one must have better people and/or a better process to put around these people, but in either case experience is needed.

I have already described a bit about how to assess the people at a quant shop, but one more point bears mentioning. How a quant deals with adversity is critical to understanding his edge and its sustainability. There are times when the model simply doesn't make money. Knowing how and when to react to these episodes is critical. By analogy, an inexperienced or inferior pilot might decide to emergency‐land his plane along the way to his destination because of a little unexpected turbulence. This is clearly a bad outcome. By contrast, take the example of Chelsey Sullenberger, the former fighter pilot who was at the helm of US Airways Flight 1549 when it had an in‐air collision with a flock of geese about three minutes after takeoff. The plane lost power from both its engines. Sullenberger recognized that there would be no opportunity to land the plane safely along its planned southbound route and decided to turn north to land the plane in the Hudson River. The 155 passengers and crew were all safely evacuated, and even the airplane was found more or less intact.

The analogy is not a bad one. An inexperienced quant may abandon a model after a little unexpected adversity. He may liquidate a portfolio or reduce its leverage drastically. Then, just on the basis of a small window of observation in which the model is performing better, he may allow the portfolio to accumulate positions again. But, as we've seen, transacting is expensive, and occasionally it leads to repercussions (as in the case of the August 2007 quant liquidation and the Flash Crash of 2010). Too often quants react in a suboptimal manner to losses in their funds, and a knee‐jerk reaction can often ruin whatever edge the strategy itself has. At the other extreme, a quant may not recognize when a generally valid strategy is simply on a crash course with total failure. One could argue that LTCM's biggest mistake was forgetting Keynes' admonition that the markets can remain irrational longer than an investor can remain solvent. There is a balance between sound fiduciary caution and being hyper‐sensitive to every bump in the proverbial road. A sound approach to managing adversity starts with good monitoring tools, which allow the quant to pinpoint problems and work to solve them rather than panicking. It is unlikely that a trader has an edge because of monitoring, but it is easy to throw away a potential edge through insufficient or badly conceived monitoring processes.

In terms of research, there are several hallmarks of a high‐quality process. The process should be vigorous and prolific, and there must be an ability to translate models efficiently from research into production. This is because most quant models eventually decay into mediocrity, and successful ongoing research must be implemented in live trading strategies to stay ahead of this decay. The research process should also deal with issues such as overfitting and look‐ahead bias, and the evaluator should ascertain exactly how the quant thinks about and deals with these critical issues. Finally, the process should at least largely follow the scientific method. In evaluating a quant trader, it is useful to ask many questions about how and why various elements of their strategy are the way they are. If a manager says he will close a position if it has moved 10 percent against him, ask him how and why he decided on 10 percent rather than 5 percent or 50 percent. If the quant says he is running a trend‐following strategy in certain markets, find out why he picked a trend‐following strategy, how he defines the strategy, and why he is using the markets he's using rather than other or simply more markets. These kinds of details will give you insight into the care with which a manager has developed the entirety of an investment strategy.

A *data edge* can come from having proprietary access to some sort of data. Earlier in the book we gave the example of a company that uses geolocational data derived from GPS signals on cell phones to aggregate macroeconomic indicators that have far less lag than the typical kinds of figures released by governments. If, in fact, these data prove useful, they might be able to trade using this information, and they might then have a data edge. But in this era of technology and regulation, it is difficult to find sustainable data advantages. These advantages eventually are competed or regulated away. It is also possible to build a data edge through superior data gathering, cleaning, and storage techniques. These are, in principle, more sustainable. Again, an interviewer should ask questions about where a trader gets his data, what work is done to clean the data, and how and why the data are stored in a certain way. Some answers will be thoughtful; others could indicate carelessness.

This kind of data edge is quite similar to a *lack‐of‐competition edge*. But lack of competition is not a long‐term plan. It is a truism in economics that, if higher‐than‐average profit margins can be had in some activity, more and more players will compete until the margins compress and normalize at levels more typical in the broader marketplace. This is likely to have happened already in at least two quant trading spaces: quant long/short and statistical arbitrage. In each of these two cases, a small number of practitioners enjoyed very little competition for some years. And these years produced excellent results. But excellent results attract a lot of attention and tend to generate a diaspora of lieutenants who form their own competitors to the original practitioner. As competition increases, the margins decrease and eventually, these strategies can even look "dead." But rather than dying, they have simply become cyclical. Thus, there are periods when players vacate the space because it offers too little reward, leaving more of the pie (and therefore better margins again) for the fewer players who remain. This cycle repeats.

In any event, in evaluating a strategy that is supposed to be without competition, it is also important to ascertain *why* there is a lack of competition. Some strategies are inherently more difficult for new entrants; others simply have not yet attracted the attention of new entrants. An example of the former, at least historically, can be found in purely quantitative options trading. This is not widely pursued because there are significant challenges associated with acquiring and cleaning data, structuring trades, and modeling the liquidity of options contracts. But this by no means implies that it cannot later become a crowded strategy with many competing firms chasing an ever‐shrinking pie.

As an example of the second outcome, I remember an experienced team that formed a hedge fund to trade corporate credit in Asia back in 2002. They had successfully carried out this strategy as proprietary traders at a bank for several years previously. They had few, if any, competitors, and their early years were very strong. Then, as time passed and more entrants to their niche crowded the field, they had to branch into other areas that were less appealing. Over time their edge, which was largely related to a lack of competition, was eroded. Ultimately, the new areas into which competition forced them to participate caused a massive drawdown in their fund. The lack of competition was really due to a lack of discovery of their niche, and these are among the most fleeting kinds of edges.

*Structural edges* generally relate to something in the market structure that puts the wind in the sails of a market participant. These are usually caused and removed by regulation. I once knew a trader in the pits of the New York Mercantile Exchange who ran a hedge fund that relied on his short‐term discretionary trading. Because of his status on the exchange, he was able to supplement a reasonable investment edge with a structural edge that allowed him to transact very cheaply and extremely quickly. Over time, however, his markets went from being pit‐traded to electronic, and his structural edge vanished. In quant trading, the most common sort of structural edge comes from liquidity provision, or the rebate, on electronic communication networks (ECNs). ECNs actually pay market participants for market‐making activities by providing commission rebates. In certain cases I have seen the act of transacting become a profitable exercise for the trader, and this too is a structural edge. It is possible that, over time, payments by ECNs for order flow will dwindle, and this edge, too, will be eradicated.

# Evaluating Integrity

Most quants, and most traders in general, are honest and ethical. Therefore, it is entirely reasonable to work with them on a "trust, but verify" basis. In other words, for most of the evaluation process it is reasonable to assume that the trader went to school where she claims, got whatever degree(s) she claims, and is generally not a criminal. But before making an investment, most observers would agree that to the extent possible, it's worth verifying a quant's ethics.

Here we have a few tools at our disposal. First, do background checks, education verifications, and reference checks. In the case of backgrounds and education verifications, serious problems in a trader's personal or professional history should probably serve as a red flag. Of course, this is a tricky proposition. The investor must determine whether the mistakes or misdeeds in a quant's past served to teach her a lesson, or whether they indicate a likely pattern of behavior that will repeat, even if not in exactly the same way. That judgment cannot be made universally for all cases. But I encourage the investor to consider this question only from one specific angle, which might help drive the answer: The job of the investor is not to judge the quant as a person but rather as a potential fiduciary, acting on behalf of the investor. Fiduciaries are bound to act in their clients' best interest and to be very open and up front about any potential conflicts of interest or anything else that could impede their fulfilling their duties to investors. Using the mentality of the fiduciary as a compass is something I have found helpful in a great many difficult circumstances.

When performing reference checks, I find it useful to request references from existing investors whenever possible and to ask them not only why they like the manager but also what they think her weaknesses are. More helpful still is to seek out references that the manager did not provide herself. It is relatively easy for any trader to find a few people to say something nice about her. But it is much better if the trader is known by others, and those others are likely to provide much more useful input than the references a trader provides for herself. If you cannot locate such references in your own network, it sometimes helps to ask the references provided by the manager whether they know anyone else you can contact.

It turns out that getting into details with quants helps demonstrate their integrity as well. Though even less skilled quants might have answers at hand for higher‐level questions about their strategies and process, even someone intent on deceiving rarely thinks through low‐level details sufficiently to be facile in answering questions about them. This is a common and successful interrogation technique in law enforcement. If you ask a suspected criminal where he was last night, it's not surprising to hear him quickly and convincingly provide an alibi, such as "at my girlfriend's house." But if you follow up by asking what time he arrived, how long he stayed, what movie he watched, what he ate and drank while he was there, and so on, he will have to make up answers to these questions he likely has not rehearsed beforehand.

A quant who is lying to cover up a lack of skill would have to be an expert at making up answers to questions about details on the fly to keep up with questions about the details of her strategy. And some people are very good liars, to be sure. However, these answers also have to be able to stand up on their own. Answers that reveal a lack of understanding of the subject matter or answers that are internally inconsistent or are deficient in other ways should not be ignored. They might not lead you to conclude that the manager lacks integrity, but they should be sufficient to conclude that she isn't very good, which is itself sufficient for the purpose of avoiding hiring her. What's more, you can use the same technique of looking for details in assessing a quant's background as in assessing her strategy. If a quant says she completed her PhD at Harvard, you can follow up by asking where she lived while she was there, what her favorite restaurants were, who her dissertation committee included, what her dissertation's title was, how many pages it ended up being, and so on. And again, some of these specifics should be verifiable with her alma mater.

It is worth mentioning one more point about selecting managers, whether quant or not: Almost no trader is so special that it is worth investing in her strategy without gaining a reasonably deep understanding of it. It should not take much to say no, in other words, whereas it should take an incredible amount of confidence to say yes. Seeing a long and attractive track record should never be sufficient. In fact, I would put forth that it is significantly more important to get good answers to good questions than to see a long track record. If Bernie Madoff and the other scandals that were announced on a nearly weekly basis in late 2008 provide any sort of lesson to investors, it must be that reputation and track record are not enough.

Investors cannot validly claim that they understood how Madoff could have made such consistently positive returns based on the strategy he is said to have employed. Madoff never addressed questions, maintaining that his strategy (which was discretionary, not systematic) was too proprietary. Though insufficient to uncover all potentially fraudulent (or simply unprofitable) investments, the tools provided in this chapter can certainly help eliminate a great majority of them. These techniques should be used in conjunction with an equally rigorous operational due diligence process to further reduce the possibility of being victimized by fraud, malfeasance, or other misbehavior on the part of traders.

# How Quants Fit into a Portfolio

Assuming that you find a quant that is worth hiring or investing in, you have to decide how to allocate to this trader. To make this determination, you have to understand how the strategy fits in with the rest of your portfolio. This is largely a question of balancing the levels of various types of exposures. This section details some of the more important kinds of exposures associated with quant investing.

#### A Portfolio of Alphas

First, it is worth remembering that portfolio construction is about allocating to exposures. A portfolio that contains more kinds of exposures is more diversified than one that is concentrated among a smaller number of exposures. Investors must seek out the appropriate balance of trend, reversion, value/yield, growth, and quality to achieve optimal diversification. A quant doing trend following is not likely to be so incredibly different, from a portfolio construction viewpoint, from a discretionary trader who is seeking to identify trends. To be sure, the tireless vigilance of a computerized trading strategy might find opportunities that the human trader misses. In addition, the human trader might avoid some bad trades that are taken on by the computerized strategy out of naïveté. But, as trend following in general goes, so it is likely that the human and computerized trader both go. So, at a primary level, the investor must diversify among various alpha exposures. In the evaluation process, the investor should be able to ascertain at least roughly the underlying alpha exposures of the various strategies in a portfolio. Using this information, the investor can allocate capital such that the blended allocations to various types of alpha are in line with the levels that the investor has determined are desirable.

# Bet Structures

The second consideration relevant to portfolio construction is bet structure, as described in Chapter 3. Relative bets can behave very differently from single‐instrument bets, particularly when these bet structures are used with different types of alpha models. When a quant strategy makes relative bets, it is inherently counting on the stability of the relationships among the instruments that are grouped together. This makes bet structure itself a source of risk in such strategies, and this risk becomes evident when the relationship between the instruments changes. In such environments, for example, relative mean reversion strategies are prone to losses. On the other hand, single‐instrument mean reversion frequently *benefits* from large regime changes. This is because this strategy tends to bet against the prevailing trend while remaining indifferent to the destabilizing effects of a large trend reversal on the relationships depended on by a relative alpha strategy. This is but one example of how bet structures can impact results and, as a result, the investor's portfolio. In short, it is worthwhile to diversify across various bet structures as well, even within the same domain of alpha exposure (e.g., relative and intrinsic mean reversion).

# Time Horizon Diversification

Finally, the investor must balance her exposure across time horizons. In general, it is my experience that longer‐horizon quant strategies—those that hold positions for more than a week or so—tend to go through longer and streakier performance cycles. They can outperform or underperform for several quarters on end, and it can take several years to evaluate whether there is really a problem with the manager. Some longer‐term strategies have also demonstrated conclusively that they are subject to crowding risk, as seen so vividly in August 1998 and August 2007. While this might make them a bit less desirable, one can manage significantly more money in such strategies, which is sometimes a practical necessity.

Short‐term strategies, by contrast, tend to be very consistent performers, but they cannot handle much capital. They are also far from invulnerable. As the years since 2008 have shown, short‐term strategies require trading volumes to remain acceptably high, volatility to be above very low levels, and correlation among instruments to be below very high levels. They are nonetheless desirable, but also not always practical. When one does find a good short‐term trader to invest in, it is not clear that the trader will remain small enough to be effective on short timescales. Many traders are tempted to grow their assets when assets are on offer, and this demands attention on the part of the investor.

# Summary of Portfolio Considerations

Quants can be valuable components of a portfolio. The investor must realize that quants are ultimately not so different than their discretionary counterparts and therefore that the list of things that matter to building a portfolio that includes quants isn't much different from what it would be without quants. As with all things related to portfolios, the key is to build a diversified portfolio that considers three important elements:

- **1.** Various types of alpha exposures
- **2.** Various bet structures
- **3.** Various time horizons

It is interesting to note that these considerations closely mirror the taxonomy of theory‐driven alphas, presented here again as Exhibit 12.1. Equally interesting, I do not believe that the investment universe (asset class, instrument class, or geography) nor various other subtleties about the models (e.g., model specification or run frequency) are particularly impactful in portfolio construction. These variations add a great deal of diversity when markets are behaving normally, but in stressful times they simply matter a lot less than distinctions along the lines of the three portfolio considerations listed here.

# Summary

To assess a quant trader and a quant strategy, one must understand the strategy being implemented and the quality and vigor of the process that generates strategies. To do this, the investor has three weapons at her disposal: building trust, gaining as much knowledge as possible about quant trading, and keeping information she learns as organized as possible. These tools can be used to extract and piece together information on a given quant, and on quant trading generally.

Ultimately, an investor has to determine whether a quant has an edge, what the sources of this edge are, how sustainable the edge is, and what could threaten it in the future. Edges come from people and/or processes, and it is in these areas that the evaluation of a quant must focus. Once

Exhibit 12.1 Taxonomy of Theory‐Driven Alpha Strategies and Implementation Approaches

quants have been vetted, they should be thoughtfully included in a portfolio. It is important to diversify across different approaches to alpha generation, different time horizons, and bet structures to complement best the other components of the investor's portfolio.

I remember once interviewing a senior employee at one of the best quant shops in the world. I asked him how on earth they had done so well, which of course was a sort of stupid question. His answer, however, was both concise and seemingly on target. To quote him, loosely: "There is no secret sauce. We are constantly working to improve every area of our strategy. Our data is constantly being improved, our execution models are constantly being improved, our portfolio construction algorithms are constantly being improved . . . everything can always be better. We hire the right kinds of people, and we give them an environment in which they can relentlessly work to improve everything we do, little by little."
