# Risks Inherent to Quant Strategies

Torture numbers, and they'll confess to anything. -Gregg Easterbrook

We have defined two broad classes of exposures: those that generate re-<br>turns in the long run (alpha and beta) and are intentionally accepted and those that do not generate long-term returns (risks) or are incidental to the strategy. For the kind of quant traders that are the subject of this book, beta exposures are generally avoided (because they can be easily obtained by generic, low-cost index instruments), and therefore we can focus on alpha and risk exposures.

As we have already stressed, the kinds of alpha exposures quants seek to capture are generally exactly the same as those that are sought by discretionary managers. However, with any strategy there is always the possibility that the exposure from which returns are generated is not being rewarded by the marketplace at a given point in time. This risk of out-of-favor exposure is shared by both quants and discretionary traders alike.

This chapter will help an investor understand the types of risks that are either unique to quant trading or at least more applicable to quant trading. In a sense, we also are providing a framework for investors to design their own risk models that can be used to help determine how to use quant trading as part of a portfolio of strategies. The latter is a topic we address again in Chapter 12.

# Model Risk

*Model risk* is the most basic form of risk any quant system brings to an investor. Models are approximations of the real world. If the researcher does a poor job of modeling a particular phenomenon—for example, momentum—the strategy might not be profitable, even in a benign environment for momentum in general. In other words, model risk is the risk that the strategy does not accurately describe, match, or predict the real‐world phenomenon it is attempting to exploit. Worse still, model risk need not be evident right away. Sometimes small errors in specification or software engineering lead to problems that accumulate very slowly over time, then suddenly explode on a busy trading day. Additionally, model risk can come from several sources. The most common are the inapplicability of modeling, model misspecification, and implementation errors. It bears mentioning that all types of model risk can occur not only in the alpha model but also from errors in any of the other parts of the strategy. Back‐testing software, data feed handlers, alpha models, risk models, transaction cost models, portfolio construction models, and execution algorithms can all have model risk in them.

#### Inapplicability of Modeling

Inapplicability of modeling is a fundamental error that comes in two forms. The first is the mistaken use of quantitative modeling to a given problem. For example, trying to model the quality of a musician is simply the wrong idea from the start. One could conceive of some relevant factors that correlate with skill in musicianship, such as the source and duration of training. But ultimately, the goodness of a musician is not a question that can be answered with mathematics or computer models. It is an inherently subjective question, and to apply computer models to it is an error.

Models that are inapplicable to the problem they're being used to solve are often created due to the use of improper assumptions, coupled with wrong judgment regarding the use of a given statistical method. The global market turmoil in 2008, which was fueled in part by the securitized mortgage business, could be an example of the problem of the inapplicability of quantitative modeling to a problem. Though these securitized mortgages were not in any way like quant trading strategies, part of their rise to prominence resulted from the quantitative modeling work done by various structured products desks inside a wide variety of banks around the world. They modeled what would happen in various scenarios, and on the back of the comfort gained in the output of these models, they issued AAA‐rated bonds backed by instruments that, each on its own, were toxic. It appears that a fundamental error was made (or ignored to rationalize massive greed) in the conceptualization of the problem. In this case, the problem was a failure to realize that there absolutely could be a dynamic in the economy that could lead to a large number of mortgage defaults simultaneously. The tools used to model and value these securities were simply not meant to handle the realities of the market to which they were applied.

A second type of inapplicability is subtler and, probably because of this subtlety, more common among quant traders. It is the error of misapplication of an otherwise valid technique to a given problem. One example of this type of error, which we have already touched on in the section on risk modeling, is the widespread use of *value at risk* (VaR). Conventional VaR uses correlation matrices and historical volatility to determine the amount of risk in a given portfolio at a point in time. However, there are many assumptions inherent in the use of VaR that are invalid. For example, the use of both correlation matrices and historical volatility (defined as the standard deviation of returns) assumes that the underlying distributions that describe the various elements in a portfolio are normal. But in fact, market data often exhibit *fat tails.* In other words, there are significantly more observations of extreme values than one would expect from a normal bell‐curve distribution. A specific example of this situation can be seen with data on the S&P 500. Based on the daily historical index data (excluding dividends) from January 3, 2000, through November 30, 2008, a –4 standard deviation day is one on which the S&P posts a return worse than –5.35 percent. A 4 standard deviation event should occur once every 33,333 trading days (approximately every 128 years, assuming 260 trading days per year) if the S&P's returns are normally distributed. In fact, the S&P has posted a return this poor on average once per 13 *months*, or *119 times more frequently* than you'd be led to believe from a normal distribution.

Furthermore, correlation coefficients (a key ingredient in the computation of VaR measurements) should be used only when a linear relationship exists between the two things being correlated. Instead, many instruments are not linearly related to each other. Exhibit 10.1 shows an interesting contrast between two relationships.

As you can see from the charts, the relationship between XOM and JAVA is not linear. Note that the best day for XOM is actually a fairly poor day (–5 percent or so) for JAVA. Likewise, the best day for JAVA is also a nearly 5 percent loss for XOM. A line that best fits this relationship would look more like the Gateway Arch in St. Louis than a straight line. By contrast, the relationship between XOM and CVX does appear to be reasonably linear. A researcher using correlation to examine the relationship between JAVA and XOM would likely be making a model inapplicability error because the relationship is nonlinear in the first place.

#### Model Misspecification

The second kind of model risk is *misspecification*. Model misspecification means that the researcher has built a model that badly describes the real world. Practically speaking, a model that doesn't fit the real world at all is unlikely ever to make money and therefore is unlikely to be observable for very long before being shut down. As such, the more prevalent misspecification errors relate to events that are uncommon. These models work fine most of the time, but they fail when an extreme event occurs. A recent example of this situation can be seen in the aftermath of August 2007, when many quants concluded that they had done a bad job of modeling liquidity risk in large‐capitalization U.S. stocks. This is because they looked at only the liquidity risk associated with their own holdings in these names. What they learned, however, was that if many large traders liquidate similar holdings at the same time, the aggregate size of these positions matters more than the size any individual trader holds.

As a direct result of this event, some quants discovered risk model or transaction cost model misspecifications and have begun to attempt to correct these flaws. But again, the rarity and unique nature of such events make them extremely difficult to model.

#### Implementation Errors

The third and perhaps most common variety of model risk is from errors in *implementation*. All quant trading strategies ultimately are pieces of software residing in hardware and network architectures. Implementation errors, or errors in programming or architecting systems, can cause serious risk for the quant trader, and in some cases also for the market at large. For example, imagine that a quant means to have his execution software buy the bid and sell the offer price using limit orders. But he programs his execution software with the signs reversed so that it buys at the offer and sells at the bid. Because of this error, he is now paying the bid/offer spread on every trade the exact reverse of his intention. This is an example of a programming error. In August 2012, Knight Trading lost more than \$400 million in a mere 30 minutes due to a software bug that caused a dormant piece of software to come back online, multiplying order sizes and causing Knight to accumulate massive positions at highly elevated prices. As they sold those positions off, the nine‐figure losses mounted. The losses, both in capital and in confidence, have had significant repercussions for Knight. The company nearly went bankrupt and was forced to sell over 70 percent of the firm to a consortium of investors at a steep discount in order to remain afloat. Not to pick on them, but this wasn't Knight's first implementation error. In March 2011, a "process error" at Knight caused the values of some newly created exchange‐traded funds (ETFs) to drop from 80 to 100 percent immediately upon their inception (the exchanges canceled those trades).

AXA Rosenberg, too, had a coding error in its risk model that resulted in a \$217 million loss to clients, which AXA eventually repaid to its investors, along with a \$25 million penalty paid to the SEC to settle the case. In this case, the error appears to have been introduced in April 2007, but it was not discovered until June 2009, and even after it was discovered, certain AXA executives apparently decided to hide the issue from their CEO, not to disclose it to investors, nor even to fix the issue. AXA finally disclosed the error to clients about three years later, in April 2010. In addition to the hefty compensation and penalty AXA paid, their assets under management dropped from \$62 billion in March 2010 to \$18 billion by the end of June 2012.

In another case, a successful quant trading firm that will remain anonymous made an architectural error. The firm has separate servers for alpha models and the execution engine. As we discussed earlier, the portfolio construction model looks to the alpha model for information on what positions it should execute on both the long and short sides. At some point during one trading day, there was a need to reboot the servers for the system. But when the servers were restarted, the execution server came online first, and a few minutes later, the alpha model was restored to service. The execution model, seeing that it had no signals whatsoever from the alpha model, rapidly and automatically began liquidating the portfolio of positions in order to eliminate risk. In the few moments before the alpha server came back online, 80 percent of the firm's portfolio was sold off and then had to be reacquired. There was no warning that this error existed until it manifested itself in this unfortunate manner. The strategy was making perfectly good returns but suddenly broke down due to a combination of a specific quirky error and the circumstances of the situation. Fortunately, returns were not very adversely affected, but this was probably merely lucky. Given the massive quantities of code that go into a quant trading strategy, such software and architectural errors are unfortunately the most common, but usually least painful (the Knight episode in 2012 notwithstanding), types of errors.

# Regime Change Risk

Most quant models are based on historical data. Even those using analysts' forecasts or other sentiment signals turn out to depend heavily on the past because sentiment usually is biased in the direction of historical trends. Regardless of the type of model, quants use past relationships and behavior

to develop theories and build models to help predict the future. If markets have behaved in a particular way for a while, quants will come to depend on that behavior persisting. If there is a regime change, the quant will typically suffer because the relationships and behavior he is counting on are altered, at least temporarily.

Dependence on the past is certainly one of the more interesting problems to consider in analyzing quant strategies and determining how to use them. In some strategies, dependence on the persistence of historical behavior is explicit, as in the case of trend following. Note that this isn't necessarily an indictment of these strategies. Indeed, such strategies have made money for decades and have exhibited better risk-adjusted returns than the stock market by far. However, if an established trend reverses, the trend follower will almost certainly lose money. Ironically, mean reversion-focused quants may also suffer during a large trend reversal, particularly if they are engaged in a *relative* mean reversion strategy. We might expect that if a reversal of trend occurs, this should be good for the mean-reversion trader, since he bets against trends. However, if the reversal is also associated with the breakdown of established relationships, this can be quite painful because of the *relative* part of the strategy. Exhibit 10.2 illustrates this point.

![](_page_6_Figure_3.jpeg)

EXHIBIT 10.2 Regime Changes in a Relationship between Two Stocks

As you can see, there are four distinct phases in the relationship between Charles Schwab (SCHW) and Merrill Lynch (MER). From early 1996 until the end of 1997, the stocks were reasonably correlated and showed similar trends. From early 1998 until early 2001, on the other hand, the stocks behaved very differently from one another, and SCHW in particular began to exhibit substantially greater volatility than it had earlier or than it would again later. The Internet bubble appears to be the cause of this shift, during which investors began to treat SCHW as an online broker, and its shares rose and fell with the likes of Ameritrade and E\*Trade instead of its more traditional peer, MER. Upon the bursting of the Internet bubble, SCHW reverted uncannily to MER's level and tracked it very closely for some time, from early 2001 until early 2007. Then, in early 2007, you can see another sharp change in the relationship, with MER dramatically underperforming SCHW. This, of course, is due to the banking and credit crisis that traces its roots to early 2007.

A quant betting on this relationship's persistence would have suffered through two reasonably significant periods in the past 10 years in which the relationship did not hold up at all. Whether these stocks have permanently decoupled or will revert again at some point in the future is a matter that is beyond my ability to forecast. But this is precisely what regime change risk is about: A structural shift in the markets causes historical behavior of an instrument or the relationships between instruments to change dramatically and quickly.

Another example of this kind of structural shift can be seen in the relationship between value stocks and growth stocks, as measured by the IVE and IVW ETFs, which represent S&P 500 Value and S&P 500 Growth, respectively. The historical spread between these two ETFs is illustrated in Exhibit 10.3.

This figure shows that the S&P Value index outperformed the S&P Growth index by some 29 percent from the start of 2004 until mid‐May 2007. The spread then trended a bit lower until mid‐July and then rapidly fell as quants unwound their portfolios, which clearly had been betting on Value to outperform Growth. This unwind, combined with the macroeconomic environment,1 set off a massive rebound in Growth relative to Value.

Note that there are two substantial, short‐term reversals of this more recent trend, one in January 2008 and one in July through September 2008, both of which are circled in the figure. These moves are incredibly sharp, actually representing the biggest and fastest moves in this spread in a very long time (certainly going back further than this analysis). In 16 trading days, from January 9 through 31 of 2008, the Value index recovered more than half the underperformance it had experienced in the 160 trading days

![](_page_8_Figure_1.jpeg)

Exhibit 10.3 Value/Growth Spread, 2003–2008

prior to that point. In other words, the reversal was five times faster than the trend that preceded it. This was another rather painful experience for quants, though not on the order of what was felt in the summer of 2007. Over the subsequent 115 trading days, the Value/Growth spread reversed over 22 percent, all the way back to breakeven, until mid‐July 2008. At that point, another brief but violent six‐trading‐day period saw the spread recover almost 40 percent of the lost ground. In other words, the reversal was almost eight times faster than the trend that preceded it. From late August through early September, the spread recovered another 36 percent of its lost ground, and over the 39‐day period from mid‐July through early September the recovery was more than 50 percent in total.

What's worse, such sharp reversals frequently cause many other types of relationships to falter. For example, the sectors that had been underperforming (such as financial companies or homebuilders) become the new outperformers, while those that had been outperforming (such as technology companies) tend to become the new laggards. Currencies and bonds also tend to reverse, as do commodities (especially over the past five years). An illustration of this last point is shown in Exhibit 10.4.

![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)

Exhibit 10.4 Value/Growth Spreads versus Oil Prices, Normalized to August 16, 2006

Note that the Oil ETF moves almost like the mirror image of the Value/Growth spread, experiencing mirroring reversals in early January and mid‐July 2008 (again, indicated by the circled periods on the graph) and mirroring trends in between. It is for this reason that regime changes are especially painful for quants: They tend to occur across many levels simultaneously.

# Exogenous Shock Risk

The third in the family of quant‐specific risks comes from *exogenous shocks*. I refer to them as *exogenous* because they are typically driven by information that is not internal to the market. Terrorist attacks, the beginning of a new war, and political or regulatory intervention are all examples of exogenous shocks. Because quant models utilize market data to generate their forecasts, when nonmarket information begins to drive prices, quant strategies typically suffer. This is especially true because such shocks usually also result in larger‐than‐normal moves. So, in situations of exogenous shock, we have big moves that aren't explainable by a reasonable model using market data but rather by information that is entirely external to the markets (see Exhibit 10.5).

![](_page_10_Figure_1.jpeg)

EXHIBIT 10.5 S&P 500 Price Index, December 1999 to December 2008

The first circled period in the S&P 500 chart in Exhibit 10.5 represents the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, D.C., on September 11, 2001. The market was closed for almost a week, and when it reopened, it dropped precipitously, only to recover much of that ground rather quickly. Ignoring the obviously horrible nature of the attack on civilians, the downward move in markets was actually a continuation of the downward trend in stocks that had begun in March 2000 and therefore benefited trend-following strategies. However, many mean reversion strategies and relative-alpha strategies suffered in September 2001 as nonmarket information dramatically and briefly changed the way markets behaved.

A similarly difficult situation was observable with the start of the Iraq war in early 2003, which is the second circled period. Suddenly global stock, bond, currency, and commodity markets began moving in lockstep with each other, all driven by news reports of the U.S. armed forces' progress through Iraq. This, too, resulted in losses for many quants, including trend followers, since the move resulted in a reversal of the prior trend across several asset classes simultaneously.

The third circled period follows the bailout of Bear Stearns in mid-March 2008. This period was negative for many quant strategies because it was a sharp trend reversal that was caused by information that could not be

anticipated by machines. Indeed, even the collapse of Bear might well have been the result of nonmarket "information," and as of this writing, the SEC is supposed to be investigating potential wrongdoing in the rumors that were spread about Bear just in advance of (and which likely contributed to) its collapse.

The final circled period represents another rally in the financial sector in equities, this one set off by the SEC's change in shorting rules, which made it much harder to short battered financial stocks. Though one can argue about whether an SEC intervention or a rumor‐based collapse and government‐brokered buyout of a major financial institution are endogenous or exogenous to the market, it is unassailably true that the kind of information these events presented to market participants was both unquantifiable and unusual. As such, exogenous shock risk is a significant byproduct of quant investing, one that it is difficult to do anything about (other than with discretionary overrides).

# Contagion, or Common Investor, Risk

The newest member of the quant‐specific risk family is *contagion,* or *common investor,* risk. By this we mean that we experience risk not because of the strategy itself but because other investors hold the same strategies. In many cases, the other investors hold these strategies as part of a portfolio that contains other investments that tend to blow up periodically. The first part of this risk factor relates to how crowded the quant strategy in question is. A second part relates to *what else* is held by other investors that could force them to exit the quant strategy in a panic, sometimes called the *ATM effect*. In an ATM effect, significant losses in one strategy cause liquidation of a different, totally unrelated strategy. This happens because investors who have exposures to both, especially if highly levered, reduce their liquid holdings in the face of financial distress and margin calls, since their illiquid holdings are usually impossible to sell at such times. In essence, the good, liquid strategy is exited to raise cash to cover the losses of the bad, illiquid strategy.

This is a particularly challenging type of risk that is certainly not exclusive to quants. However, the clarity with which this risk expressed itself in both August 1998 (easily argued not to be a quant event) and August 2007 (clearly a quant event) demands specific attention. In August 1998, it was not quant trading that suffered but other strategies such as merger arbitrage. We will discuss both of these events in greater detail later, but for the moment, it bears mentioning that there is one striking similarity between the two: In both cases, a credit crisis leading to illiquidity in credit instruments sparked a forced sale of more liquid assets that had nothing to do with the credit crisis.

In 1998, many relative value equity arbitrage positions, which bet on convergence of share prices between stocks that are either dually listed or else are merging, suffered dramatically as an indirect result of the Russian government's defaulting on its debt obligations. The famous example used by Lowenstein in *When Genius Failed* was Royal Dutch and Shell, a dual‐ listed company. Royal Dutch had been trading at an 8 to 10 percent premium to Shell, and the bet was that the two stocks should eventually converge, eliminating the premium. In hopes of this, Long‐Term Capital Management (LTCM) and many others had long positions in Shell and short positions in Royal Dutch. After all, there was no rational economic reason that a European listing of a given company should outperform a U.S. listing of the same company. Yet because LTCM had to vacate this position at a time when there was little liquidity, the spread widened from 8 to 10 percent to more than 20 percent by the time LTCM was trading out of it. The reason that this position had to be sold is that LTCM also had massive losses on its positions in Russian debt. The Russian bond holdings were part of a relative yield trade that paired a long position in high‐yield Russian debt and a short position in lower‐yielding U.S. debt (which was a hedge against interest rates moving higher globally and which financed the long Russian position). When Russia defaulted, no one particularly wanted to buy the billions of dollars of their debt that LTCM was stuck with. And so, LTCM was forced to liquidate equity positions such as Royal Dutch and Shell to raise cash in a panic.2

It is inaccurate to call the LTCM crisis a quant blowup. To be sure, some of those who worked at LTCM were quite good at mathematics. But ultimately, the strategies in which they were engaged, in particular the ones that caused the most trouble, were not quant trading strategies. They were engaged in a very broad cross‐border and cross‐asset class yield game in which they constantly sought to own risky assets and sell safer ones against them. It was, in most respects, a highly leveraged, one‐way bet on ongoing stability and improvement in emerging markets and the markets in general.

August 2007 was a far different affair and much closer to home for most quant funds. Several drivers coincided, leading to disastrous performance among relative‐value‐oriented quant strategies. The causes were the size and popularity of certain quant strategies, the somewhat poor performance of these strategies for the period leading up to August 2007, the cross‐ ownership of these strategies with far less liquid ones by many players, and the widespread use of VaR‐like models to target constant volatility.

The first driver of the quant liquidation crisis of 2007 was the size and popularity of quantitative long/short trading strategies. From 2004 to 2007, many blue‐chip managers launched quant long/short strategies targeted at attracting large pools of investor capital, either large institutions or individual retail investors. The firms launching these products were attracted by the low turnover and longer‐term investment horizons of long/short strategies, both of which are necessary for the placement of large sums of capital. Investors were also attracted by the positive returns in quant long/short products from 2004 through the early part of 2007 and by the blue‐chip brand‐name managers launching the products. In aggregate, it is likely that hundreds of billions in cash was invested in quantitative long/short funds and bank proprietary trading desks, and with leverage, quant long/short traders likely controlled about \$1 trillion in gross positions (the value of longs and absolute value of shorts added together). The vast majority of these positions were held in larger‐capitalization U.S. securities because the large numbers of deeply liquid stocks allowed for sufficient diversification and size of assets under management to accommodate both the managers' and investors' needs. Even though there was actually a great deal of diversity in the underlying models of the various firms launching these products, enough of them had sufficient overlap to make individual trades get very crowded.

The second driver of the debacle was that many of these operators had already begun to suffer subpar returns for a period leading up to the summer of 2007. Many big‐name funds with a U.S. focus were flat or negative year to date before August. This is partly because "value" had underperformed "growth" since at least the end of May 2007, after several years of outperforming growth, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Many multistrategy and prop‐trading desks also tend to chase recent performance, adding capital to whatever has been doing well and reducing whatever has been doing poorly. This tendency, coupled with the weak results of quant long/short trading strategies for the few months leading up to summer 2007, is likely to have contributed to especially itchy trigger fingers for risk managers who already felt the need to reduce risk in their broader portfolios.

A third cause, and in my view a critically important one, was the widespread practice, especially among banks' proprietary trading desks and multistrategy hedge funds, of either explicitly or implicitly cross‐collateralizing many strategies against each other. The huge profits enjoyed by hedge funds and prop‐trading desks before this summer attest to their exposure to credit spreads that kept narrowing in early 2008. These credit‐based strategies have historically proven to be far less liquid in a crisis than they appear during "normal market conditions," and in July 2007 some credit managers experienced spectacular and sudden losses. This, in turn, drove them to seek to raise cash by selling whatever strategies were still liquid. This ATM effect is the main similarity between the 2007 meltdown and the 1998 situation described earlier.

The fourth factor leading up to the liquidation was *risk targeting* (which we discussed in Chapter 7), whereby risk managers target a specific level of volatility for their funds or strategies. They hope to achieve this "constant risk" by adjusting leverage inversely with the amount of risk their portfolios are taking. The most common tool for measuring the amount of risk in a portfolio is VaR. As already discussed, VaR measures the risk of individual instruments (using the variability of their returns over time) and combines this with how similarly they are trading to each other (a correlation matrix). With models such as these, risk is computed to be higher when market volatility is higher and/or when correlations among individual instruments are higher. However, note that these two phenomena can be causally linked in that markets tend to become more volatile precisely *because* they are being driven by a risk factor that also leads to higher‐than‐normal correlation among individual instruments. In other words, both inputs to a VaR risk model can rise simultaneously, and these increases can be driven by the same underlying causes.

The decline in market volatility that characterized the period from 2003 through 2006 led to a dramatic increase in the amount of leverage employed in a wide variety of strategies heading into 2007 through two channels. The first was by virtue of the use of risk targeting models for leverage, as described above. When volatility declined, risk targeting models called for increased leverage to keep volatility constant. To deliver the same volatility in early 2007 as was being delivered in, say, 2002 or 2003 would have necessitated increasing leverage by at least one‐and‐a‐half to two times. In other words, what used to be a four‐times gross leverage strategy had become a six‐ or eight‐times leveraged strategy.

Secondly, when volatility declines, opportunity also declines, and returns tend to go down. Strategies that had been reliable producers of double‐digit returns in the late 1990s and early 2000s had begun to deliver low single‐ digit results. Investors and managers both wanted better nominal returns, and thus leverage went up, even with many shops that did not utilize risk targeting approaches. However, in summer 2007, particularly in late July, volatility began to spike dramatically as the credit crisis began in earnest. This led to a requirement for many players to reduce leverage simultaneously because their VaR models reacted very negatively to the simultaneous jumps in correlations and volatility.

To review, there were four main drivers of the crisis quants faced in August 2007: (1) large sums of money invested in value‐based quant strategies with at least some similarity to each other—in other words, the "crowded trade" effect; (2) poor year‐to‐date performance in quant long/short trading in the United States; (3) cross‐ownership of illiquid credit‐based strategies that were experiencing large losses alongside more liquid quant strategies, causing the latter to be used as an ATM in a time of crisis; and (4) the decline of volatility, which led to increased leverage both because of volatility targeting‐based leverage adjustments and the desire to produce higher nominal returns.

It appears that the crisis started when several large multistrategy hedge funds and/or proprietary trading desks began to deleverage their portfolios in response to poor performance in credit‐oriented strategies. In addition, market volatility was rising, leading to higher VaR levels and therefore lower leverage targets. The deleveraging began with quant long/short trading in the United States, the most liquid strategy at hand, which also happened to have been underperforming. Managers sold off their longs and covered their shorts, causing substantial market impact. The stocks that had been long positions experienced substantial, fundamentally inexplicable price declines while the stocks that had been short positions experienced similarly violent price increases. This meant that anyone holding any of those stocks in the same direction as they had been held by the liquidators saw large, adverse performance as a result. In many cases, stocks were moving at incredible speed on massively increased volume as quants had to unwind their holdings.

For example, one crowded short trade was in Pulte Homes (NYSE: PHM). Exhibit 10.6 illustrates the issue.

This table contains several fascinating pieces of data. Note that PHM was declining through the early part of the summer on an average volume of 3.5 million shares per day. Then, on July 24, the volume spiked to 7.2 million shares per day, and the stock exhibited an accelerating price decline. Over the next four trading days, however, volumes increased another 50 percent, and there was a huge reversal in the stock, which recovered about half its 44‐day decline in four days (i.e., the stock was moving about 20 times faster than it had been previously). This also happens to be an interesting illustration of the quadratic nature of market impact. The first 100 percent increase in volume was absorbed by the marketplace without a change in the stock's direction. But the next 50 percent increase seemed to be on the wrong side of a tipping point in the market's supply of sellers,

| PHM, Summer 2007    | Price Change (%) | Average Daily Volume |
|---------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| May 31–July 23      | −22.0            | 3.5 million          |
| July 24–August 3    | −12.5            | 7.2 million          |
| August 6–August 9   | +15.6            | 10.4 million         |
| August 10–August 31 | −22.6            | 5.7 million          |

Exhibit 10.6 Pulte Homes, Inc. (NYSE: PHM), May 31 to August 31, 2007

and indeed, a trader covering a short position on August 9 was paying as much as 15 percent in market impact, many hundreds of times the average cost to liquidate. As soon as the liquidation pressure subsided, which by all accounts was during the afternoon of August 9, the stock resumed its downward march, falling almost 23 percent on volumes much closer to the average prior to the quant liquidation.

Other types of quant traders, such as statistical arbitrageurs, seemed to provide the necessary liquidity to quant long/short players in late July. Statistical arbitrageurs usually feast on environments like this, and no doubt many were happy to provide liquidity as they bet that prices would eventually converge. Many long positions with relatively attractive valuation characteristics were being sold at extremely depressed levels while expensive, poorer‐quality short positions were reaching ever‐higher prices as a result of the quant long/short liquidations. These stocks had diverged from their peers so significantly that they must have appeared to be excellent trading opportunities to the average stat arb trader, who bets that such stocks will converge again to a "fair" relative value. But at some point, the stat arb traders were also experiencing significant losses by taking on the inventory of other quant funds, inventory that kept flooding the market relentlessly. In front of this tidal wave, stat arb traders could not continue providing liquidity. As they began to experience losses from having acquired these positions, they, too, became anxious to go to cash, adding fuel to the fire.

This was likely the tipping point, and suddenly both stat arb traders and quant long/short traders began to experience significant losses that weren't explained at all by fundamentals but purely by a lack of sufficient liquidity. Thus, by August 7 the situation was starting to get very troubling. A broader set of strategies, such as statistical arbitrage, was losing money at breakneck speed and beginning to liquidate alongside the quant long/short traders. Finally, the dam broke on August 8, with huge losses across many types of strategies and with these strategies responding by suddenly liquidating in an effort to preserve capital. Losses began to spread from U.S. strategies to international strategies, especially those implemented in Japan (which was at that time the most popular non‐U.S. market for quant long/short and statistical arbitrage trading).

A wide range of fundamental signals began to lose money as the overlap between the aggregate of all liquidating managers began to overwhelm virtually any level of differentiation between managers. For the first time during this crisis, even growth‐based and momentum‐oriented factors began to lose money rapidly. Note that these strategies usually hold *opposite* positions from the value‐oriented and mean‐reversion‐oriented strategies. Thursday, August 9, was pure bedlam in Quant Land. An enormous cross‐ section of strategies, many of which were extremely far removed from the original losers, began to bleed money. Intraday P&L charts started negative in the morning and literally every minute of the day ticked lower and lower as a huge variety and number of quant equity funds liquidated positions. Whereas a few signals had still been working on August 8, in quant equity trading it was hard to find anything except cash that made money on August 9. It appears that any stock that was attractive for any reason was being sold down, whereas any stock that was unattractive for any reason was running up. In short, most quant equity traders had the worst day in their history, and a great many reduced leverage to extremely low levels, with many shops going completely to cash.

A bit more should be mentioned about why so many managers reacted in the same way, namely by deleveraging and liquidating positions. Early August was a period of exceedingly perverse behavior. Not only were tried‐and‐true factors not working, they were actually working negatively. And because the primary discretion employed by a great many quant managers is the decision to unwind positions in the event that the models are behaving badly, quant managers did exactly that, leading other managers with any overlap experiencing losses and doing exactly the same thing in response. The losses incurred, it is important to note, were solely the result of market impact.

One of the clearest proofs of this point is that one large, well‐known quant firm was suffering like everyone else in early August. On August 9, in a panic, the firm tried to convene its investment committee to determine what to do. But several members of the committee were on their summer holidays, so a meeting was scheduled for Monday, August 13, and in the meantime the lieutenants managing the portfolio day to day kept the fund fully invested. As shown earlier in Exhibit 10.6, prices returned to their previous trends fairly quickly when the liquidations stopped. (PHM, for example, was down about 12.3 percent by the close of business on Monday, August 13, merely two trading days later.) As such, by the time the investment committee met, its fund had recovered a huge proportion of its losses, and the committee elected to hold the course.

Perhaps the greatest irony of the broader situation in August 2007 was that smaller, more boutique quant traders, engaged in less commonplace strategies that had minimal overlap with the more conventional and larger‐ scale institutional quants, ended up experiencing losses and liquidating their portfolios only very late in the game. As alluded to earlier, managers whose losses began to accumulate only in the middle of the second week of August ended up needing liquidity at the tail end of an already massive deleveraging. This forced them to pay incredible transaction costs (all from market impact) to reduce their leverage. Reports of losses at extremely prestigious funds abounded. The range of losses was wide, from –5 to –45 percent, and few equity traders emerged unscathed from this event.

What separated August 2007 from prior market crises, even from the great crash of 1987, was that there was no general market panic during this period. U.S. stocks were approximately flat for the first 10 days of August, whereas stocks internationally were down in the small single digits. What we witnessed in this period was nothing short of a liquidity crisis in the most liquid stocks in the world, driven by market‐neutral investors whose hundreds of billions of dollars of position selling led not to a market collapse but to almost no change at all in equity index values. It was a situation where losses were very heavily attributable to the cost of liquidation and market impact, rather than simply "being wrong" about the trade to begin with. This is a fine, mostly academic distinction, but in dissecting the incident, it bears mentioning. This situation illustrated for the first time that contagion/ common investor risk can appear in liquid quant strategies almost as much as in illiquid or discretionary strategies. For the first time, crowding became a risk of quant trading strategies.

# How Quants Monitor Risk

Any discussion of quant‐specific risks also merits a discussion of quant‐ specific tools used to target those risks. Chapter 7 described risk models at some length as models that seek to eliminate or control the size of exposures in a portfolio. But quants also utilize various pieces of software to monitor these exposures, their systems, and the kinds of quant‐specific risks we have discussed in this chapter. There are several types of monitoring tools, most notably exposure monitoring, profit and loss monitoring, execution monitoring, and systems performance monitoring.

*Exposure monitoring tools* are straightforward enough. They start with the current positions held and then group and/or analyze these positions for whatever exposures the manager is concerned about. For example, in a futures portfolio, if the manager wants to see how much of his portfolio he has invested in the various asset classes (equities, bonds, currencies, and commodities), this is something he can do with exposure monitoring software. Similarly, one can group instruments by any other set of characteristics that are of interest, such as their valuation, the level of momentum they have exhibited, their volatility, and so on. Many equity traders (using either proprietary tools or off‐the‐shelf software such as BARRA or Northfield) monitor their gross and net exposure to various sectors and industries, to various buckets of market capitalizations, and to various style factors such as value and growth. VaR‐based tools also measure exposure in terms of the overall, gross level of risk being taken in a portfolio, at least according to that measure of risk. The tools are straightforward, but the art is in how to use them. Experienced managers can discern from the exposures in their portfolios whether the model is behaving as it should be. If exposures are out of line based on either limits or expectations, this can be an early warning that there is a problem with the model or else problematic market conditions.

*Profit and loss monitors* are similarly straightforward. They also start with the current portfolio, but they then look at the prices at which the portfolio's positions closed the previous day and compare those to the current market prices for the same instruments. Many managers look at charts of the intraday performance of their strategies to determine quickly and visually how the day is going. These tools are also important in watching out for several types of model risk. If the strategy appears to be performing in an unexpected manner, either making money when it should be losing or vice versa, the manager can check into the reasons for this anomalous behavior. Or alternatively, the manager can see patterns in his performance that can alert him to problems. We alluded to this idea in discussing the performance of various quant strategies during August 2007, when the intraday performance charts were showing deterioration in the performance with nearly every passing tick. We know of at least one manager who noticed this intraday pattern and, as a result, quickly conducted research that enabled him to reduce his risk much earlier than most, thereby saving him much of the loss experienced by other traders who only acted later.

Other types of profit and loss monitors look at *how* money is being made or lost rather than *whether* money is being made or lost. For example, quants can analyze the realized and unrealized gains and losses of their strategies. Many strategies are constructed to cut losing positions quickly and ride winning positions longer. But if a quant sees that her strategy is holding losers for longer than usual or selling winners more quickly than usual, this can be an indicator that something is wrong and needs to be corrected. This kind of tool also frequently tracks a *hit rate,* which is the percentage of the time that the strategy makes money on a given position. Again, the designer of a strategy usually understands what the hit rate of a trading strategy should look like, and substantial deviations from the norm in this metric can be important indicators of problems.

*Execution monitoring tools* are usually designed to show the quant trader the progress of his executions. They typically show what orders are currently being worked and which ones recently were completed, along with the sizes of the transactions and prices. Fill rates for limit orders are also tracked to help monitor the execution algorithms' performance, particularly for more passive execution strategies. Some managers specifically measure and monitor slippage and market impact in their order execution monitoring software, which allows them to see whether they are getting the kinds of results from their execution strategies that they would expect.

Finally, *systems performance monitors* are used largely to check for software and infrastructure errors. Quant traders can monitor any aspect of their technology, from the performance of CPUs or the speed of various stages of their automated processes to latency in the communication of messages to and from the exchanges. This kind of monitoring is perhaps the most important for sniffing out systems errors and some types of model risk.

# Summary

Quant trading offers many potential benefits to investors and practitioners. The discipline, computing power, and scientific rigor brought to bear on the challenge of making money in a highly competitive marketplace certainly pay dividends overall. However, quants have their own sets of problems to deal with. Some of these problems are unique to quants (e.g., model risk), but most are simply more significant for a quant strategy than for a discretionary one (e.g., common investor or contagion risk, exogenous shock risk, and regime change risk). Quants utilize various types of tools to monitor their systems and risk, which can mitigate the downside associated with the risks of quant trading.

Having discussed the challenges facing a quant trader and how the quant faces these challenges, we turn our attention to various criticisms of quant trading that are widely espoused in the marketplace.

- 1. The macroeconomic environment around this time, and for some time thereafter, favored companies that are in "growth" industries. During this period, that meant those positively linked to commodity prices, such as oil companies or gold‐mining companies, and those in businesses that are less dependent on economic cycles, such as telecommunications firms.
