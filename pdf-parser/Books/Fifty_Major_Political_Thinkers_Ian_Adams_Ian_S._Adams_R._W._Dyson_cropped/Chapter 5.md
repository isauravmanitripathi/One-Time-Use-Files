## **St Thomas Aquinas (1225-74)**

St Thomas was born in the castle of Roccasecca near Aquino in Italy, into a wealthy and aristocratic family. He was educated at the Benedictine Abbey of Monte Cassino, where his uncle was abbot. In 1245, despite family opposition, he joined the Dominican order and went to the University of Paris to study under the German theologian Albertus Magnus. He took his master's degree in 1256 and spent the next eighteen years teaching and studying at Paris, Naples, Orvieto, Viterbo and Rome. His *Summa contra gentiles* - a manual for missionaries to Muslims and Jews - was completed in 1264. He began the enormous *Summa theologiae* in 1266 and worked on it until his health failed in 1273. He died on his way to the second Council of Lyons. Most of his political doctrines emerge incidentally, during the theological and moral discussions of the *Summa theologiae*. His only exclusively political work is a longish fragment called *De regimine principum*: part of a much larger work which he abandoned in about 1267 and which was subsequently completed by his pupil Tolommeo of Lucca.

The most obvious feature of St Thomas's philosophy is the extent to which it is influenced by the ideas and thought-patterns of Aristotle. Largely thanks to the triumph of Neoplatonism as mediated through the writings of Augustine, Aristotle's ethical and political writings were effectively unknown in the West from late antiquity to the end of the eleventh century. The study of these writings had for many years been the province of Arab commentators, most notably Averroes (1126-98). That they again came to be studied in the West is due to a handful of translators and exegetes, mostly working at the University of Paris; it was there, under the tutelage of Albertus Magnus, that St Thomas was introduced to them. Not surprisingly, the Church regarded this 'recovery' of Aristotle with disfavour. Apart from his own paganism, the fact that Aristotle had been so much studied by Arab scholars was enough to infect him with the taint of Islam. Matters came to a head in 1277, with the formal condemnation of a long list of Aristotelian doctrines by Bishop Tempier of Paris. Despite perhaps because of - the climate of opposition to Aristotelianism that prevailed throughout his professional career, St Thomas was convinced from the beginning that Aristotle's teachings could be reconciled with the Christian faith. Aristotle - 'the Philosopher' - had carried intellectual investigation as far as it can go without the advantage of divine revelation. When his conclusions are divested of error and supplemented by revealed truth, the resulting synthesis of reason and revelation will yield an intellectually complete system. So St Thomas believed. To produce such a synthesis through the kind of minute philosophical analysis exemplified in the *Summa theologiae* became his life's work.

As we might expect, then, his political thought departs fundamentally from the Platonist and Augustinian orientation of earlier generations. Augustine, with his eyes fastened on the world to come - the transcendent other-world of the Christian Neoplatonist - had found the present world sin-laden and disordered, and its politics merely harsh and coercive. To Augustine, the individual is aligned either with earth or with heaven. To be the ally of one is to be estranged from the other. St Thomas, by contrast, finds nothing to quarrel with in the rational, humane and ordered world depicted by Aristotle. He sees no irreconcilable tension between the acquisition of present goods on earth and the achievement of eternal ones in heaven, provided only that the former are directed towards the latter and the latter are not neglected in favour of the former. To be sure, man has a true and final end - eternal beatitude with God in heaven - of which Aristotle knew nothing; but earthly happiness also is possible and desirable. Life on earth is not the welter of misery that St Augustine depicted, and the achievement of temporal well-being is an end that, though limited and secondary, is valid and worthwhile.

The achievement of such well-being requires government, but this is not 'Augustinian' government, ordained to suppress human destructiveness by force and fear. It is a benign administration suited to the kind of sociable and co-operating creature that man is. Nobody is able to provide themselves with all the necessaries of life: we need to co-operate in order to secure the benefits of a division of labour. There may be more than one way to achieve our ends, and we need to be guided wisely towards them just as a ship needs to be steered into harbour. These are facts that have nothing to do with sin. They are simply facts of human nature. They are the facts that make it necessary for a human community to be knit together in a common purpose by wise leadership directed to the common good.

In *De regimine principum*, St Thomas holds that the kind of leadership our condition requires is best provided by a king. Kingship, because it is government by one, is the most natural kind of government. Its archetype is God's government of the universe, and we see it mirrored everywhere in nature. It is the most efficient kind of government because a king's power is undivided and his freedom of action unlimited. The discussion of governmental forms in *De regimine principum* is incomplete. In the *Summa theologiae*, St Thomas again recommends kingship, but this time a kingship tempered or limited by elements of democracy and oligarchy. This, of course, is an Aristotelian prescription, borrowed from Aristotle's account of mixed government in the *Politics*. St Thomas follows Aristotle in supposing that this kind of government will derive stability from the fact that it will please all sections of the community.

But the king must understand that his function is not merely to rule externals. In the final analysis his task is to create conditions of life conducive to the virtue and salvation of his subjects. Whatever he does should have material well-being only as an intermediate goal. His true reward is not any material gain, nor is it the passing glory that comes from human renown. It is the eternal blessedness of heaven. This kind of thing is, of course, a stock in trade of ecclesiastical writers. It is a curious fact, however, that St Thomas does not develop an explicit theory of 'Church and state'; or, at any rate, he is somewhat vague and noncommittal in what he has to say. He states in a general way that the Supreme Pontiff - the pope - is Christ's earthly representative, that the king should submit to the spiritual guidance of the priesthood, that in certain unspecified cases the king is subject to the temporal authority of the Church, and that spiritual and temporal power coincide in the Supreme Pontiff. But he does not draw out the detailed implications of these statements, for reasons about which we can only speculate - possibly because he was not personally involved in any political controversy.

Because, for St Thomas, politics is a benign and positive activity and civic happiness a worthwhile end, he takes a view of tyranny different from the 'traditional' Augustinian one. His thought on the subject is not wholly divested of Augustinian elements, but he tends not to regard tyranny as a divinely intended punishment, nor does he hold that the right to disobey a tyrant extends only to those commands that manifestly flout God's will. Kings exist to do more than merely suppress wickedness and test faith: they exist to secure a common good or a public interest. If, therefore, instead of this, the king devotes himself to his own private good - if he becomes a tyrant in the sense specified in Book III of Aristotle's *Politics* - he has betrayed the purpose for which God has appointed him, and his people have no obligation to obey. What action St Thomas thinks them entitled to take is not entirely clear, at least partly because he himself does not think the question amenable to a clear-cut answer. Some commentators have thought him inconsistent or pusillanimous on this issue. In his relatively youthful *Scripta super libros sententiarum*, speaking with apparent approval of the

assassination of Julius Caesar, he seems to subscribe to a version of tyrannicide, at least when the tyranny is extreme and no other course of action is available. In *De regimine principum*, he takes the view that action may be taken against tyrants, but only by those who are in some sense authorised to do so: either because they have a formal 'kingmaking' role, or because they are carrying out the will of an oppressed community. Tyrants may not be overthrown merely on the private judgement of someone who happens not to like the king. Again, in *De regimine principum* and the *Summa theologiae*, St Thomas holds that tyranny of a relatively mild kind should be tolerated and that action should be taken only where the harm and scandal involved is not greater than the advantages that doing so may be expected to secure. We may read these statements in conjunction with what he says elsewhere about war and violence: that wars waged to repel aggression or escape oppression, and reasonable force used in self-defence and without malice, are morally justified, but one must always be careful not to do more damage than one averts. His position is not really inconsistent; nor, strictly, does he fudge the issue. His remarks, taken together, add up to a position of cautious conservatism, which recognises that extreme measures may be justified but should be avoided if at all possible.

The best-known part of St Thomas' political writings is the section of the *Summa theologiae* in which he develops his fourfold typology of law as eternal law, natural law, human law and divine law. He conceives law as being a rational pattern somewhat after the fashion of Plato's 'forms' or 'ideas'. Any relationship between a superior and an inferior involves, as it were, a picture in the mind of the superior of what the inferior should do or be, just as, before he actually makes anything, the craftsman has in his mind an idea of what his product will be like. In the case of a relationship between ruler and subjects, the idea that the ruler has in his mind of what his subjects should do is what we call law. It is the 'rule and measure' that, when formulated and promulgated, governs their acts; when the subjects act as they should, they 'participate' in the law in the way that a table 'participates' in the idea of a table which the carpenter has in his mind. Because God is the supreme governor of everything, the pattern of the government of the universe that exists in His mind is 'law' in the most general and comprehensive sense: it is the 'law' that makes the universe orderly and predictable rather than chaotic and irrational. This rational pattern is what St Thomas calls the 'eternal law', and to it everything in the created universe is subject.

Inasmuch as humankind is part of the order of the universe, it follows that there must be a portion of the eternal law that relates to human conduct specifically. This is the *lex naturalis*, the 'law of nature' or 'natural law'. The idea is a very ancient one, but St Thomas expounds it in unprecedented philosophical detail. There is a broad sense in which all animals have a 'natural' law: the sense, that is, in which all sentient creatures have an instinctive urge to protect and reproduce themselves. But the natural law to which humans are subject is not a mere instinct to survive and breed. It is prescriptive also: it tells us what to do. It tells us to do good and avoid evil; it tells us to live at peace with our neighbours. It is 'natural' to us in the sense that we are by nature creatures to whom its prescriptions are rationally obvious. We do not have to learn about them or have them legislated for us: to all human beings, pagans included, they simply 'stand to reason'.

But why, in that case, is it also necessary to have 'human' or 'positive law'? The reason is that the provisions of the law of nature, though clear to us, are too general to furnish us with sufficiently specific guidance. We know that we ought to do good and avoid evil, but we do not know what actually is good or evil in specific circumstances; nor do we know what to do with people who do evil: what punishments should there be and who should incur them?

Human laws are particular rules deduced by practical reasoning from the general principles of the natural law. They are derived from it in much the same way as, in scientific or speculative reasoning, we arrive at particular conclusions by deduction from first principles. All human law, properly so-called, takes its character as law from the fact that it is derived from the natural law. Human laws can be changed or dispensed from in order to suit changing times or exceptional circumstances, but the general principles of natural law cannot be changed and must always be honoured. By the same token, 'laws' that are not derived from the natural law - laws that are unjust in the sense that they oppress those subject to them or fail to secure their good - are not really laws at all, and so we are not bound to obey them. They have, St Thomas says, more the character of force than of law. And so a similar condition here arises to the one that we noted in connection with tyranny. We should obey even unjust or tyrannical laws if the consequences of disobedience would be worse than any good that disobedience might secure. But we are not *obliged* to obey, simply because the 'laws' in question are not really laws, and so cannot oblige. (The point is more obvious in Latin than in English, inasmuch as *lex*, 'law', is related etymologically to *ligare*, 'to bind'.)

The fourth and final kind of law is 'divine law'. The divine law differs from human law in that it is not derived by a process of rational inference from the more general principles of nature, and not all of its precepts 'stand to reason'. It is part of the eternal law, but it is the law of revelation, made accessible to us through the teaching of scripture and the Church. Why do rational creatures need a revealed law over and above the natural and human laws? The answer to this is that human law is concerned only with the external aspects of conduct. Eternal salvation, on the other hand, requires that we be inwardly virtuous as well as outwardly obedient. The divine law regulates our inner lives; it regulates those aspects of conduct that no one can see; it punishes us in so far as we are sinners rather than merely criminal; it guides us in those duties which are religious rather than civic.

Broadly speaking, then, St Thomas's theory of law is of the kind called 'intellectualist' rather than 'voluntarist'. He thinks that law derives the morally important aspects of its character not from the will or command of a legislator, but from the rational content that it embodies; legislative pronouncements that depart from, or fail to institutionalise, the natural law simply do not have the character of law. Promulgation and command are important parts of what make law a reality, and there is a formal or technical sense in which even bad laws are laws; but no one who commands or promulgates something that is against nature makes law in the proper sense. Ultimately, the value and validity of law depends upon its conformity to eternal and invariable moral principles.

The fact that he was for so long the semi-official philosopher of the Roman Catholic Church has tended to insulate St Thomas from criticism. It is fair to say that he has been somewhat overrated as a philosopher. His literary style is difficult. He is apt to set off in pursuit of elaborate and distracting side issues. His arguments tend to be clouded by needlessly subtle and sometimes trivial distinctions: this is a criticism that has perhaps been levelled too much against scholasticism in general, but it is not wholly undeserved. He is committed in advance to a closed system of religious and moral beliefs, and his 'philosophical' arguments are devised with a view to supporting and confirming those beliefs. Having said this, we can hardly fail to admire his persistence and diligence and the ambitious scale of his philosophical thinking. Specifically in regard to political theory, we may make three remarks. First, St Thomas was responsible, almost if not quite single-handedly, for reintroducing the political and ethical thought of Aristotle into the educational curriculum of the Latin West. This, in itself, is a fact of considerable significance. Second, and as a direct consequence of

the rehabilitation of Aristotle, he was responsible for a large-scale re-evaluation of political activity and participation as worthwhile activities apart from any connection with the Church. We may say that, in this respect, he helped to make 'modern' normative political theory possible. Third, although he himself abstains from any extended treatment of 'Church and state', he made available the intellectual equipment with which his immediate successors were to begin to unravel the long-established interweaving of secular and spiritual themes in European political writing. These facts establish him in a place of the first importance in the history of political thought.
