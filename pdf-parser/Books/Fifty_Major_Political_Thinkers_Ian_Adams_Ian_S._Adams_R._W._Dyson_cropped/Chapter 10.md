## **James Harrington (1611-77)**

James Harrington was born in Lincolnshire, England. He inherited a large fortune from his father while still a young man. After studying at Oxford, he made the customary Grand Tour of Europe. He was much impressed by the Republic of Venice and returned home in 1635 a convinced republican, though he remained a loyal supporter and friend of Charles I. After the king's execution, Harrington's financial independence enabled him to devote himself to his major work, *The Commonwealth of Oceana*, published in 1656. After the Restoration, Harrington was suspected of plotting to reinstate the Commonwealth. Arrested in 1661 and imprisoned for a time in the Tower, he suffered a breakdown in health from which he never fully recovered, although the rumour that he died insane is probably without foundation.

Harrington shows little respect for the political thinkers of his day. He esteems Hobbes as a philosopher, but dislikes his politics. His political models are Plato's *Laws*, Aristotle's *Politics*, Polybius's *Histories* and the writings of Machiavelli, whom he especially admires. *Oceana* is a description of the government of a purportedly imaginary commonwealth, but the events, places and people depicted are only lightly disguised: 'Emporium' is London, 'Hiera' is Westminster, 'Leviathan' is Hobbes, 'Panurgus' is Henry VII, 'Parthenia' is Elizabeth I, 'Olpheus Megaletor' is Cromwell, and so on.

An important and original principle of Harrington's political thought is the causal link that it posits between economic distribution and political power. The form and operation of government inevitably depends, he thinks, on the distribution of property, especially of land. When the control of land rests with a monarch who lets it to numerous tenants in exchange for military service, the result is absolute monarchy. When the land is in the hands of a relatively small number of nobles who maintain large bodies of retainers, the result is a mixed or feudal monarchy. Feudal lords are able to limit the power of the monarchy, but are prevented by their own mutual quarrels from overthrowing it altogether. When the great feudal estates are broken up and the nobles are no longer able to support their retainers, the result is a commonwealth or republic. In short, government follows property: one form of government turns into another in response to changes in land distribution. Not surprisingly, therefore, Harrington's account of English history is primarily economic. The old feudal order had depended upon the division of property and power between kings and nobility. This division was unbalanced by the Wars of the Roses and the economic changes effected by the Tudors. Henry VII redistributed the great feudal estates among a relatively large number of proprietors. Henry VIII, in dissolving the monasteries, redistributed the property of the largest landowner of all - namely, the Church. The result was the creation of an increasingly numerous class of yeomen from whom, as they became collectively aware of their own power, the demand for political rights was bound to come. Hence the Civil War, the conflict that arose as political realities adjusted themselves to economic realities.

Given, Harrington continues, that recent English history has witnessed a redistribution of property in favour of the people, it follows that the form of government now appropriate indeed, inevitable - in that country is a republican one. Harrington's project is to devise for 'Oceana' a constitution that will create what he calls an 'equal' commonwealth: namely, a balanced and stable commonwealth within which there are no serious conflicts between selfinterest and public interest, so that it is in no one's interest to subvert it. Such a commonwealth must, he thinks, rest upon the impartial rule of law rather than upon the inconstant and partial will of men. Its most fundamental basis will be an agrarian law that will protect popular ownership of land against the natural tendency of property to accumulate in the hands of the few. This agrarian law would, as far as possible, restrict land ownership to holdings having an annual value of not more than £2,000. Harrington's idea of popular ownership is, however, rather different from what we should nowadays call popular. He thinks that as few as 5,000 landed proprietors would be enough to make the commonwealth stable.

The government should, Harrington thinks, embody three features that will secure responsiveness to the popular will. First, there is to be rotation in office, to ensure that the members of the community all have a chance to play their part in government. Magistrates are to be elected for short terms only, usually not exceeding one year, and they should not be eligible for immediate re-election. Second, elections should be conducted by secret ballot, so that neither fear nor favour can play a part in the result. Third, there is to be a bicameral legislature. The deliberative or policy-forming function is to be performed by a Senate consisting of a few persons of wisdom and experience. The acceptance or rejection of the Senate's legislative proposals is to rest with a larger body called the 'Prerogative Tribe', which is, however, to have no deliberative authority of its own. Both parts of the legislature are to be elected by the citizens through an elaborate system of indirect election involving ascending tiers of government - parishes, hundreds and 'tribes' - and property qualifications.

Harrington restricts citizenship to persons of independent means. Wage-earners or servants people whose livelihood depends on someone other than themselves - cannot, he thinks, have a disinterested political will. The citizens or freemen are divided into those under thirty, who are the active military class, and the elders - the 'orb' of the commonwealth - who form the military reserve and are the main repository of political wisdom. Citizens with incomes of £100 a year or more are to serve in the cavalry when required; those with incomes of less than £100 a year will be infantrymen. No one is exempt from military service, and there is to be conscription if necessary. Suitable arrangements are to be made for the care of the old and infirm.

Education is to be an important feature of the commonwealth. Schools should be provided at public expense, and attendance is to be compulsory between the ages of nine and fifteen. Harrington understands that the viability of a government depends largely on the belief and understanding of those subject to it. Education is therefore to include weekly classes for the purpose of explaining the constitution and maintaining political awareness. Harrington also gives much thought to how the religious life of the commonwealth is to be organised. There is to be a non-compulsory state religion, overseen by a council of religion elected by the Senate. Each congregation is to be free to choose its own minister. When a vacancy arises, two representatives of the parish are to request one of the two universities to appoint a minister, who will hold his office on probation for one year. The parishioners will then vote on whether his appointment is to be confirmed, such confirmation depending on a majority of two-thirds. The clergy will not be allowed any occupation apart from their parochial duties, but in order to ensure that there will be no shortage of candidates for the ministry, no benefice is to be worth less than £100 a year. There is to be freedom of worship for everyone except Jews and Catholics, and no religious coercion of any sort. When disputes over religious matters arise, they are to be referred to the divines of the two universities, who will settle them by debate and discussion.

Much of what he says is derived, as he happily admits, from 'ancient prudence', but Harrington has considerable ability as a political theorist. As a designer of constitutions, he was admired in eighteenth-century America. It has been suggested that he influenced the

drafting of the constitutions of Carolina and Pennsylvania. Marxist historians have found support in his writings for the theory that the English Civil War was a bourgeois revolution caused by the so-called 'rise of the gentry'. Many of the devices that he recommended have become established as standard features of liberal government: a written constitution; the election and rotation of magistrates, with short terms of office; guarantees of religious freedom; popular education at the public expense. Harrington is often congratulated on his objective treatment of political problems. He himself conceived political theory to be a science comparable to the anatomical work of William Harvey. The degree of rational detachment that he achieves is all the more remarkable in view of the political turmoil by which his lifetime was distinguished.
