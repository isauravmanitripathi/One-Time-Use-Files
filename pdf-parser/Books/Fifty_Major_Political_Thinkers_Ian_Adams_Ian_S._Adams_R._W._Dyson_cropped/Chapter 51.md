# **Glossary**

#### **anarchism**

Anarchism is the view that social relations can and should be organised without coercive government or, indeed, any formal structures of authority that might restrict spontaneous human action and association. Implicit in anarchism is the belief that human beings are by nature benign and co-operative, and that government, as restrictive of individual freedom, is intrinsically an evil. Anarchism is almost by definition a revolutionary ideology. Reform from above is, *ipso facto*, reform initiated or covertly directed by those in authority, and therefore not real reform. True social change must involve the replacement, by violent means if necessary, of the state.

## **aristocracy**

Aristocracy comes from the Greek word *aristokratia*, 'rule by the best'. It does not necessarily mean a hereditary nobility (there are, for example, military aristocracies, such as Sparta in the fifth century bce), although when 'the best' are selected according to expertise or educational attainment, this nowadays tends to be known as 'meritocracy'. For Aristotle, aristocracy is rule by the best in the common interest, as distinct from 'oligarchy', which is rule by the wealthy few in their own interest. Plato and Aristotle are both aware of how easily the former can turn into the latter.

#### **capitalism**

Capitalism is that system of economic organisation or 'mode of production' within which (1) the means of production and distribution are wholly or mainly privately owned, and (2) goods and services are exchanged at prices determined with a view to the profit of private owners. Marx believed that capitalism is inherently unjust, partly because it requires those whom it employs to sell their labour at less than its market value, the difference being the profit of the employer. It has in practice proved possible for elements of social ownership to exist within the capitalist mode of production without destroying or seriously disrupting it. Liberals tend to see capitalism as an important (for neo-liberals, the all-important) guarantee of human liberty.

## **civil rights**

Originally 'civil' rights were those rights deemed to belong to individuals simply as members of civil society. Especially in the 1960s, the phrase came to mean specifically the rights of ethnic (and especially black) minorities in the United States. It is in this sense that the phrase 'civil rights movement' is used. As part of this usage, 'civil rights' now often, or usually, refers to group rights as much as to individual ones.

### **civil society**

The term 'civil society' has been used in a number of ways by writers since the eighteenth century. It is now usually used in (more or less) the sense intended by Hegel to mean that sphere of society in which individuals associate freely in

relationships and organisations - firms, voluntary associations and other corporate bodies - intermediate between the state and the family. It is, in other words, the field of all the public and social relationships in which the state does not ordinarily intervene. The general tendency of government in the twentieth century was to reduce the size of that field and hence to erode, however slowly, 'civil' rights. However, New Right government of the 1970s and 1980s sought to reverse this trend.

#### **communism**

According to Marxist theory, communism is the final and highest stage of human development. It will come about following the communist revolution, although not immediately. The revolution will overthrow capitalism and bring the workers to power in a worldwide 'dictatorship of the proletariat', which has the task of creating the classless, stateless, equal society that is communism. However, after the first communist revolution in Russia in 1917, the revolutionaries (or 'Bolsheviks') led by Lenin argued that because the workers' revolution had not spread around the world, as Marx had predicted, it had to be protected by all means possible until the rest of the world caught up. This justified a gigantic state apparatus that dominated every aspect of Russian life. Lenin's regime, and those modelled on it (like China), came to be called 'communist' even though none of them claimed to have achieved genuine communism. In this way the term came to be associated with a totalitarian system in which the state owned and controlled everything: that is, the very opposite of what Marx understood by the term.

### **conservatism**

Conservatism, particularly in its traditional British form, is a set of beliefs, or an 'ideology', emphasising the preservation of traditional ways, mistrusting rapid or discontinuous change, and to that extent favouring only slow and piecemeal alterations to the existing order. Always a force of some kind in politics, it came into its own in Europe especially after, and in reaction to, the French Revolution of 1789. Forms of conservatism in Europe up to World War II tended to be more reactionary and nationalistic. In England and America during the 1970s and 1980s, conservative politics tended to identify itself with neo-classical or New Right liberal views on such subjects as economics and state intervention.

#### **critical theory**

The term 'critical theory' was coined by the German social philosopher Max Horkheimer (1895-1973) and is associated with the Frankfurt School, of which he was a leading figure (along with Theodor Adorno and Herbert Marcuse). The School was inspired by Marx's early writings and its members were critical of his later works, which Marx regarded as more 'scientific'. 'Critical' theory is contrasted with 'traditional' theory, as exemplified in the natural sciences. Whereas the task of traditional theory is to investigate a stable and unchanging reality, that of critical theory is to identify the conditions necessary to a rational form of social existence: in other words, to work towards a state of affairs not yet realised. Traditional theory is an impartial and scholarly pursuit, while critical theory is committed to human emancipation and the achievement of radical social change. JÃ¼rgen Habermas is the thinker most associated with the later development of the Frankfurt School.

## **Enlightenment**

'The Enlightenment', like 'Romanticism', is a term of notoriously elastic meaning. Roughly, it may be taken to denote the cultural and intellectual history of the eighteenth century in so far as that history is characterised by love of rational order, liberal politics, belief in progress, and faith in scientific reason as the engine of progress. It is customary, though not wholly satisfactory, to think in terms of a French, an American and a Scottish Enlightenment. The great philosophers of the seventeenth century - Hobbes, Descartes, Locke, Newton - are usually regarded as the fathers of Enlightenment thought. Montesquieu is the political thinker most associated with the French Enlightenment.

## **epistemology**

The term 'epistemology' means 'theory of knowledge'. It is the branch of philosophy concerned with origin, structure, methods and validity of knowledge: that is, with investigating what can be known and how. The philosophy of Plato is perhaps the best example of how epistemology may be adapted to the service of politics.

## **hedonism**

'Ethical' hedonism identifies pleasure as the highest good; 'psychological' hedonism holds that the attainment of pleasure and the avoidance of pain are the chief or only explanations of human motivation. The one does not necessarily imply the other, but most ethical hedonists (see thomas hobbes; jeremy bentham; john stuart mill) are also psychological hedonists, if only implicitly.

## **idealism**

### See materialism.

### **ideology**

An ideology, broadly speaking, is a collection of ideas purporting to describe the world in which its exponents live and to prescribe for them the kind of political actions necessary to maintain that world or change it for the better. Coined by the eighteenth-century French philosopher Antoine Destutt de Tracy, the word has been used in a number of different, and not always compatible, ways. The degree of integration that ideologies exhibit is very variable. Thus, fascism and Marxism (see benito mussolini and fascism; karl marx) are closely defined ideologies, with clear doctrines and a scriptural canon against which orthodoxy can be checked. Liberalism, by contrast, is a very loose and adaptable ideology. Conservatism is so lacking in 'doctrine' as to be hardly an ideology at all.

## **intellectualism**

The term 'intellectualism' has a number of applications. In medieval legal theory (see st thomas aquinas), it is the doctrine that the essence of law is its conformity to reason (ultimately, to the Divine reason) and therefore that the validity of law depends upon its embodying rationally apprehensible moral standards: a bad or immoral law is not

really a law at all. By contrast, 'voluntarism' (see marsilius of padua) holds that law derives its binding force from the will of a legislator, reinforced by coercion or the threat of coercion, and that moral content is not part of the definition of law. 'Voluntarism' in this sense is synonymous with 'legal positivism'.

### **Keynesianism**

'Keynesianism' is a shorthand term for the economic and social doctrines associated with the British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946), especially as set forth in his *General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money* (1936). As generally understood, Keynesianism advocates government intervention in the economy to manipulate demand, in the interests of maintaining continuous steady growth and full employment. Keynes himself believed that these things could be accomplished without any serious disruption of the existing order. In the United Kingdom, very high levels of inflation and unemployment during the 1970s led to a general abandonment of Keynesian economics in favour of 'supply-side economics', which concentrates on controlling inflation and other obstacles to the optimum working of the free market.

#### *laissez-faire*

*Laissez-faire* is the doctrine that economies work according to a 'natural law' that fixes prices according to the relation between supply and demand, and therefore should be 'left' to 'function' according to that law. The doctrine is associated particularly with exponents of classical and neo-classical liberalism (also called 'neo-liberalism'). It favours the idea of a minimal or non-interventionist state, which leaves individuals alone to pursue their interests in free markets. When economies are regulated by states or such business associations as cartels or 'trusts', this is, in effect, an interference with a natural process and can only lead to baneful consequences, such as inflation.

## **legal positivism**

#### See intellectualism.

#### **liberalism**

Liberalism is usually said to have originated in seventeenth-century England, as the ideology of the emergent middle class or 'gentry' whose members wished to assert their own political and economic status and oppose the 'divine right' absolutism of the Stuart kings (see john locke). It emphasises the rights and personal autonomy of the individual, private property, the rule of law, the importance of consent as creating political obligation, the need for a minimal or non-interventionist state, and *laissezfaire* economics. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, 'classical' liberalism gave place to a version of liberalism that accorded more emphasis to the idea of community and was more tolerant of provision of welfare by the state. This new 'social' or 'welfare' liberalism is particularly associated with the ideas of T.H. Green and L.T. Hobhouse. The revival of interest in individualism and *laissez-faire* economics that characterised politics in Britain and the United States during the 1970s and 1980s is often called 'New Right' or 'neo-classical' liberalism or 'neo-liberalism'.

## **materialism**

In politics and sociology, materialism is the view that the character of political and social experience - including how we think or feel about such experience - is wholly or mainly determined by the material conditions under which it occurs. The bestknown exponent of materialism in this sense is Karl Marx. The opposite view, 'idealism', is that 'mind', 'consciousness', 'ideas', and so on, determine the nature of social being and shape its material conditions. Kant and Hegel are both 'idealists' in this sense. In philosophy, materialism is the doctrine that only matter exists; idealism is the opposite view, that only minds and mental representations exist or have true reality.

### **metaphysics**

Metaphysics, or 'what lies behind nature', is that branch of philosophy purporting to deal with the ultimate reality underlying the realm of sensory experience. It therefore has to do with such things as existence, substance, causality, and so on. The Ancient Greeks were the first philosophers to pursue it seriously. Much of what used to belong to metaphysics has either been abandoned altogether or 'hived-off' into other disciplines such as psychology, and the predominantly analytical character of philosophy in the twentieth century tended to have a discrediting effect on metaphysics. Largely thanks to Professor A.J. Ayer and like-minded positivists, there was a time during the second half of the twentieth century when 'metaphysics' was used more or less as a synonym for 'nonsense'.

## **minimal state**

See state.

#### **mode of production**

In Marxist theory (see karl marx), a mode of production is the form taken by the organisation of economic or productive relations prevailing at any given period of history and therefore determining the social, political and other human institutions characteristic of that period.

### **monetarism**

Monetarism is the name given to the economic doctrine asserting (1) that changes in the money supply in an economy cause changes in the general level of prices; (2) that increases in the money supply are inflationary in tendency; and (3) that inflation can be controlled successfully only through restrictions in the growth of the money supply. In its modern form, the doctrine is especially associated with the Chicago School of economists, to which belong Milton Friedman and F.A. von Hayek. Monetarism especially commended itself during the 1980s to successive British governments, to whom the control of inflation sometimes seemed to be the sole aim of economic policy. Monetarism is the most extreme form of 'supplyside economics', which has dominated Western economic thinking since the late 1970s.

#### **moral relativism**

Moral relativism is the doctrine that there are no absolutely, objectively discoverable moral standards, and that ideas of 'right' and 'wrong' are simply relative to the moral community whose ideas they are. On this view, universal moral prescription is impossible, and attempts to engage in it are probably no more than instances of cultural imperialism. Moral relativists characteristically ground their opinion on two things: (1) moral diversity (that is, the actual perceived differences of moral conviction as between one community and another); and (2) the apparent absence of any rational apparatus whereby moral disagreements may be resolved.

#### **neo-classical liberalism/neo-liberalism**

### See liberalism.

### **Neoplatonism**

Neoplatonism is the name given to the revival and development, in the third century ce and after, of the philosophy of Plato. The tendency of Neoplatonism is to bring out the mysticism implicit in much of Plato's thought. Neoplatonism postulates an ultimate reality called the One, from which Mind, Soul and Matter - and therefore all sensible particulars - emanate as 'hypostases'. The chief exponents of Neoplatonism were Plotinus (205-70 ce), Iamblichus (*c*. 245-326 ce) and Proclus (412-85 ce). The markedly Neoplatonist character of Christian philosophy down to the thirteenth century is due largely to the influence of Neoplatonism on the thought of St Augustine.

## **New Right liberalism**

See liberalism.

#### **nominalism**

Nominalism is (to put it crudely) a philosophical doctrine invented in the eleventh century to solve the problem of how 'universals' - that is, concepts that can be predicated of more than one subject - can be said to exist. Nominalists hold that abstract ideas have no independent existence or reality, and therefore that words expressing such ideas ('purple', 'two', 'good') have meaning only in so far as they are the 'names' of individual instances of them. Thus, Hobbes, Bentham and Mill all believe that 'good' and 'evil' are only 'names' that we give to the things which we find pleasurable and painful respectively.

#### **normative political theory**

Political theory is 'normative' in so far as it is concerned with what *ought* to be: with what values we should live by, such as freedom and justice, and how they can be put into practice. It therefore deals with questions about how we should live, what kind of society we should strive to create and what laws we should have.

## **oligarchy**

Oligarchy refers to rule by the few, usually a wealthy minority. For Aristotle, oligarchy is the 'perverted' form of aristocracy: it is government by the wealthy few in their own interests. The word is not intrinsically evaluative, but nowadays it has almost always an unfavourable sense. Political theorists such as Robert Michels and Joseph Schumpeter have emphasised the oligarchical or elitist tendencies latent in all organisations.

## **patriarchy**

'Patriarchy' is a word with several distinct meanings. In modern political writing, and especially in feminist writing, it refers to the alleged dominance, in most known human communities, by males of social, political and private life. Such writing typically takes it for granted that the normal relation of the sexes is exploitative, with women as the victims. It is suggested that the law - especially family law - and other mechanisms of social control and value-transmission systematically institutionalise and defend male values, or values that serve the purposes of male hegemony.

## **prerogative powers**

Prerogative powers are extra-legal powers that may be used at the discretion of a sovereign. The intention is that they will be deployed in an emergency or in circumstances not covered by the normal provisions and processes of the law, where a final arbiter is required. The idea of prerogative powers was first formulated - though not, of course, invented - by John Locke.

#### **radicalism**

Radicalism, as the term is used in this book, is the political stance of those eighteenthand nineteenth-century figures who directed their efforts towards such things as extension of the franchise, popular participation in politics, civil liberties, greater social welfare and religious toleration. It is associated also with non-conformism or scepticism in religion. The term is also used more generally, as in the expression 'radical right', to refer to any sustained attempt to challenge the existing order or widen the terms of political debate.

#### *raisons d'Ã©tat*

A term, originating in the seventeenth century, designating political matters, especially in the field of international relations, deemed to be of so urgent or important a character that they override all other considerations, including the 'normal' requirements of morality.

### **Renaissance humanism**

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement among scholars and teachers that developed in Italy in the Renaissance period and spread to the rest of Europe. It was a reaction against the scholasticism that dominated the universities of the time. Whereas scholastics emphasised the study of logic, metaphysics and Aristotelian science, the humanists regarded such studies as arid and of little use to the conduct of life. They instead advocated the study of history, literature, moral philosophy and,

above all, languages. They were responsible for the revival of Ancient Greek and of a purer and more authentic Latin, and for making these the basis of European education until the twentieth century. More broadly, they promoted the view that Ancient Greece and Rome were the pinnacles of human civilisation, whose achievements should be emulated - though in a Christian context.

### **revolution**

Revolution is, literally, the 'turning around' of political power, usually (though not always) by sudden and violent means. Revolution is not, however, a mere *coup d'Ã©tat*: not, that is, the mere replacement of one ruler by another. It involves the thorough and fundamental transformation of the social and political order affected by it. Thus, Marxists expect communism to be effected by a revolution of the proletariat; monarchy in France was abolished by the Revolution of 1789. The term is used in an extended sense also, to refer to such large-scale episodes of change as the Industrial 'Revolution'.

#### **Romanticism**

The Romantic Movement began in the late eighteenth century as a reaction against the fashionable ideas of the Enlightenment, and indeed it is sometimes known as the 'Counter-Enlightenment'. Whereas the Enlightenment stressed reason and science and universality in understanding human affairs, Romantic thinkers insisted that these were at best limited. They stressed the particularity and uniqueness of every individual, society and culture, and they believed that it was history, literature and the arts in general that gave us greatest insight into the human condition. Romanticism expressed itself in a multitude of different and sometimes contradictory ways. In politics there were influences across the spectrum. The conservatism of Burke has a distinctly Romantic dimension, with its stress on unique history and traditions, while the liberalism of Wilhelm von Humboldt stressed the need for freedom so that each person could fully develop their unique individuality - he influenced John Stuart Mill and social liberalism. However, the greatest influence of Romanticism was probably on nationalism and the view that each people has its own special heritage and destiny.

#### **scholasticism**

Scholasticism is an imprecise term for philosophy as practised in the medieval Christian universities: the 'schools'. Broadly speaking, it has the following features: (1) love of minute analysis; (2) respect for the intellectual authorities of the past, especially (from the mid-twelfth century) the authority of Aristotle; (3) preoccupation with the reconciliation of faith and reason; (4) logical precision, sometimes especially in later scholasticism - carried to the point of mere hair-splitting; and (5) verbal disputation as a method of instruction and clarification. The beginning and end of scholasticism are hard to identify (university curricula were still largely 'scholastic' in the seventeenth century), but the thirteenth century is usually supposed to have been its heyday and St Thomas Aquinas its most distinguished exponent.

## **socialism**

Socialism represents a long tradition of political thought that stresses the values of social equality and social solidarity. Its modern form began in the early nineteenth century as a response to industrialisation and unrestricted capitalism. Many early forms of modern socialism were based on small self-governing communities (for example, Robert Owen and William Morris), but the twentieth century has seen a stress on state ownership and planning. Marxism is a revolutionary form of socialism with a history of its own (see karl marx), but most socialists have sought change by peaceful democratic means. In the late twentieth century, the experience of communist regimes led many socialists to give up the prospect of abolishing capitalism and instead see the ideal society in terms of state-managed capitalism and extensive welfare. This 'social democracy' has become the dominant form of socialism in the Western world.

#### **sovereignty**

Sovereignty is the right to exercise, within given territorial borders or over a particular area of the world, a power than which there is none higher. Thus, in the United Kingdom, the authority of Parliament is 'sovereign' in the sense that everyone is bound by, and no agency may disregard or overturn, the laws that it makes and causes to be enforced. Again, Great Britain and Argentina have for many years been in dispute over the 'sovereignty' of the Falkland Islands: that is, over who has the right to own and control them.

## **state**

The word 'state' occurs in several different senses in the history of political thought; it is a mistake to suppose that the city-state of classical Athens, Machiavelli's *lo stato* and the modern nation-state are the 'same thing' in any but the most tenuous sense. 'The state' need mean no more than 'the governed community'. In most modern occurrences, it denotes all those agencies and institutions within given territorial boundaries that (1) are authorised to make and enforce law; (2) are responsible for protection and defence; and (3) possess a monopoly of legitimate coercive force. The phrase 'minimal state' expresses the conviction of classical and neo-classical liberals that liberty depends upon restricting or reducing the power of the state over the lives of individuals.

#### **totalitarian**

An adjective used to describe regimes that seek to include every aspect of life within the sphere of governmental control, and thus hold sway over the 'totality' of human existence in the name of some doctrine. Because such regimes are characterised by extensive bureaucratic control, insistence upon ideological conformity, high levels of intervention and surveillance, and drastic legal and penal systems, the term is almost always used in a pejorative sense.

## **utopia**

'Utopia' is a pseudo-Greek neologism meaning either 'no place' or 'good place'. The word originates with Sir Thomas More's little book of which it is the title and theme. 'Utopian' has by extension come to denote a literary form depicting an imaginary ideal society. Such a society is typically one from which present evils have been eradicated and in which perfect peace, harmony and justice prevail. Anachronistically enough, the earliest 'utopia' is probably the 'Kallipolis' of Plato's *Republic*. In relatively recent times, the word 'dystopia' has been coined as the name of a literary sub-form depicting imaginary societies in which present evils have become worse. Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World* is an example of 'dystopian' literature.
