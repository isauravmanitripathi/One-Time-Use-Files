## **Marsilius of Padua (***c.***1275-***c.***1343)**

Marsilius of Padua - Marsiglio dei Mainardini - was born shortly after the death of St Thomas Aquinas, in Padua, Italy. He studied medicine at the Universities of Padua and Paris, and became Rector of the University of Paris in 1312 or 1313. His major political work, a long and complex treatise called *Defensor pacis*, was finished in 1324 and dedicated to the German king Ludwig of Bavaria. He subsequently wrote two shorter works, Marsilius of Padua *De translatione imperii* (*c.*1326) and Marsilius of Padua *Defensor minor* (*c.*1340), the latter being, as one might expect, a condensed version of *Defensor pacis. Defensor pacis* was at first published anonymously, but in 1326, in circumstances that are not clear, the identity of its author became known and Marsilius thought it prudent to leave Paris. He and a colleague, John of Jandun, took refuge in the court of Ludwig of Bavaria, who had been in conflict with Pope John XXII since the disputed imperial election of 1314. Marsilius seems to have accompanied Ludwig on his Italian expedition of 1328. *Defensor pacis* was formally condemned by John XXII in the Bull *Licet iuxta* in 1327.

Marsilius, like St Thomas, is steeped in Aristotle; but while St Thomas has relatively little to say on the subject of 'Church and state', Marsilius uses Aristotelian modes of thought to strike at the root of the medieval Church's claim to fullness of power in temporal matters. The Church's interference in such matters is, he says, one of the most notorious causes of civil strife, and his purpose is to offer a remedy for such strife. *Defensor pacis* is the antithesis of the arguments put forward by John of Salisbury in the *Policraticus*. On the analogy of body and soul, John of Salisbury had argued that the government of a kingdom ought to be entirely subject to ecclesiastical supervision and that the prince should be subject, if necessary, even to deposition at the Church's behest. Marsilius, by contrast, wishes not merely to reduce the Church's role or curb its pretensions, but to exclude the Church entirely from all part in the conduct of temporal affairs.

A kingdom or state is, Marsilius argues, a sufficient or 'perfect' community. By this, he means exactly what Aristotle means when he describes the *polis* in similar terms: a community within which human beings can live to the full the kind of life appropriate to their kind. If such a life is to be achieved and enjoyed in peace, the various occupations in which men engage must be harmonised with one another for the common good. Following Aristotle, Marsilius mentions six such occupations: farmers, artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests and magistrates. Social harmony is achieved when the magistrates govern the other groups for the good of all according to law. Although he has a preference for elective kingship, it does not much matter to Marsilius whether government is in the hands of one, few or many, provided that the object sought by government is the common good rather than a sectional or individual good. In this, again, he follows Aristotle's analysis of constitutional forms. We note that, as with St Thomas, this new Aristotelian political thought is entirely divested of 'Augustinianism': there is no suggestion that human association and its ends are in themselves base or sin-laden. Granted that they are not our final ends, the ends at which organised human life aims are nonetheless worthwhile.

Marsilius thinks that government should be government according to law. The rule of law is the best safeguard against the perversion of government by individual or partial interests: another Aristotelian motif. Unlike St Thomas, Marsilius is a legal positivist. Whereas St Thomas is an 'intellectualist', holding that the authority of law comes from the rationality of its content, and ultimately from its association with divine reason, Marsilius is a 'voluntarist' who defines law simply as the will or command of a human legislator, a *legislator humanus*, reinforced by the threat of coercive sanctions. A not-unintended effect of this definition is to exclude the possibility of a law being declared invalid by the Church because of some alleged defect of moral content. Law, Marsilius thinks, should emanate from the *universitas civium*, the 'universality of the citizens': that is, from the people, or at least from the 'weightier part' of the people (what he means by 'weightier part' is not entirely clear). There are several reasons for this. If law is made by one or a few, it can more easily become subservient to particular interests. People are more ready to obey laws if they feel they have made those laws themselves. The purpose of law is to secure the common good, and the people themselves are the best judge of what is in the common good. Finally, if the law is to be enforced successfully against transgressors, the co-operation of the whole community is required for this to be done effectively. Also, and for similar reasons, Marsilius favours a republican form of government. Princes or magistrates - the *pars principans*, the 'ruling part' - should be elected by the people over whom they are to exercise authority. In making these recommendations, Marsilius has the model of the Italian civic republics in mind, although he seems to intend his political prescriptions to have universal application.

If a state is a sufficient community governed by law, it follows that none of its citizens can claim exemption from the law. Priests are no longer a people set apart, as the medieval Church had insisted for so long. The priesthood is just another occupational group within the community. Its members, *qua* citizens, have no more claim to be exempt from the civil law because they are priests than builders do because they are builders. By the same token, there is no reason why ecclesiastical property should be exempt from taxation merely because it is the property of the Church rather than of any other association within the state. For Marsilius, because individual members of the clergy are just as much citizens as anyone else, their traditional claim to be beyond the reach of secular jurisdiction carries no weight. This is not to deny that the clergy are ministers of the divine law. Moreover, Marsilius does not dispute that the divine law is law in the proper sense. It is the command of a Legislator, Almighty God, and it is reinforced by the threat of coercion in the form of eternal damnation. But the good to which the divine law is directed is not of this world, nor will the sanctions by which it is reinforced apply in this world. The role of the clergy is to prepare us, by instruction and admonition, for the life that is to come after this one. The affairs of this world are entirely in the hands of the secular authorities; the affairs that are in the hands of the ecclesiastical authorities are not of this world. The ecclesiastical authorities therefore have no right to interfere in temporal matters, and no right to coerce any member of the community. Like physicians, they may teach and advise, but they may not compel. Heretics, simply in so far as they are heretics, may not be coerced at all; in so far as their heresy involves criminal behaviour, they should be coerced by the secular power only.

Marsilius is not content merely to exclude the clergy from temporal affairs. He wishes to challenge the whole way in which the Church is governed. Just as sovereignty in the political community should lie with the universality of the citizens, the *universitas civium*, so should the Church be governed by the *universitas fidelium*, the 'universality of the faithful'. The hierarchical organisation of the Church is a matter of convenience only. It has no supernatural origin. Apart from a certain pre-eminence in dignity, the pope is in a position of equality with other bishops. Final authority in matters of doctrine and scriptural interpretation should be vested not in the pope, but in a General Council, which should include secular as well as ecclesiastical delegates. The Council should be elected by the citizens of the various sovereign states, and its decisions should be enforced, in so far as enforcement is necessary, by the secular governments of those states. The pope should be chosen by the people as represented in the Council, and the Council should have the right to depose him.

Marsilius wrote at a time when the Church was demoralised by the migration of the papal curia to Avignon, and when the emergence of nation-states in Europe was in any case eroding the traditional supranational claims of the papacy. He is an early precursor of the 'conciliar movement' associated with Jean Gerson (1363-1429), Nicholas of Cusa (1401-64) and Aeneas Sylvius (1405-64): this movement sought, albeit without ultimate success, to replace the authority of the pope with that of a representative Church council. Without too much simplification, we can say that *Defensor pacis* began to sound the death-knell of the 'high' medieval ideal of papal monarchy and to prepare the way for the increasing secularisation of political thought during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.
