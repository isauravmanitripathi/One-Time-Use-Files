# **John of Salisbury (1120-80)**

John of Salisbury, also called John Little, was born in Salisbury, England, and educated largely in France. After ordination to the priesthood he joined the household of Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, in a secretarial capacity. His duties brought him into contact with senior figures in the ecclesiastical and secular life of England and continental Europe, including Pope Eugenius III (1145-53) and Nicholas Breakspear, who in 1154 became Pope Hadrian IV. John was a lifelong friend of Thomas Becket and supported him against Henry II after Becket became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162. In consequence, John spent the years between 1163 and 1170 in exile, either in France or at the papal court. He continued to promote Becket's cause from abroad until the latter's assassination in 1170, whereupon he returned to England. In 1176, by which time his health seems to have been failing, he was consecrated Bishop of Chartres, where he remained until his death.

John's political principles are most fully stated in his *Policraticus*, a rambling treatise of some 250,000 words which he finished in about 1159 and dedicated to Becket. Much of it is devoted to a discussion of the follies and weaknesses of courtiers. From our point of view, its interest lies chiefly in the picture that it presents of the Church as sovereign over all aspects of life, temporal and spiritual, public and private. As is characteristic of twelfth-century political thought, his argument is not about 'Church and state' considered as discrete entities, but about how, within the same community or corporation, two functioning parts are related: *regnum* and *sacerdotium*, the temporal power of kings and the spiritual power of priests.

It is with a view to elucidating this relationship that John develops his 'organic analogy'. He conceives the political community as a kind of macrocosm - a large-scale counterpart - of the human body.

[T]he place of the head in the body of the commonwealth is filled by the prince . . . The place of the heart is filled by the Senate . . . The duties of eyes, ears and tongue are claimed by the judges and governors of provinces. Officials and soldiers correspond to the hands . . . The husbandmen correspond to the feet, which always cleave to the soil.

## (*Policraticus* 5:2)

The imagery is self-consciously classical, but it is, of course, biblical as well. As St Paul tells us, we are all one body, with Christ as the head. This is a language with which John's contemporary audience would have been entirely familiar.

If the prince is its head, the soul of the body politic is the Church. The soul gives life, unity and purpose to the whole, and the prince must acknowledge himself subject to the Church just as, in the human body, the head is subject to the soul. By this, John does not mean merely that the prince must submit to the Church in spiritual or religious respects. In his secular office also he is bound to respond to the Church's supervision and direction, translating the law of God into the law of the civil community. John wishes to argue, indeed, that the prince's power is actually conferred on him or delegated to him by the Church. More strictly, it is bestowed on him by God acting through the agency of the Church. In developing this argument, he draws upon the symbolism of medieval coronation ritual. The prince receives *the sword of blood [his temporal power] from the hand of the Church, although she has no sword of blood at all; or, rather, she has this sword, but she uses it by the hand of the prince, upon whom she confers the power of bodily coercion, retaining to herself authority over* 

*spiritual things in the person of the pontiffs.*

# *(Policraticus 4:3)*

One implication of this argument is clear: what the Church confers, the Church can also remove.

What, though, of the time-honoured Roman law doctrine that the prince is *legibus solutus*, 'not bound by the law'? There is, John concedes, an obvious sense in which the prince is not bound by the law: in the sense, that is, that no one is in a position to enforce it against him. But the good prince subjects himself to the law voluntarily, and by serving it seeks the common good that it is the purpose of law to secure. He functions as a 'head' should, and directs the whole body to its corporate advantage. The tyrant, by contrast, disregards the law and seeks his own private good at the expense of his subjects. If the prince is or becomes a tyrant, the Church may discipline him or depose him. The Church can dispense his subjects from their oath of fealty to him, preach a crusade against him, or even sanction his assassination by his subjects. John is prepared to say explicitly that those who usurp or misuse the 'sword of blood' may rightly and justly be slain: 'the priests of God regard the slaying of tyrants as a godly deed' (Policraticus 8:20). It should be noted, however, that John sanctions tyrannicide only in extreme circumstances. For the most part, it is better to suffer and pray for deliverance; experience shows that tyrants usually come to bad ends anyway.

In comparative terms, John is not a political philosopher of the first rank. Strictly speaking, he is not a political 'philosopher' at all. The *Policraticus* is more a compendium of classical and biblical anecdotes and quotations than a developed argument. John's humanist learning is impressive, and the *Policraticus* was valued in the later Middle Ages as a storehouse of such learning, but his relationship with the literary past is largely second-hand and not, indeed, entirely honest. One of his ostensible sources, a treatise attributed to Plutarch called *Institutio Traiani* ('The Instruction of Trajan'), is almost certainly an invention of his own, devised to lend the authority of antiquity to his thesis. The *Policraticus* does, however, represent the earliest medieval attempt to state, in a way that is recognisably theoretical rather than merely controversial or assertoric, the political claims that the Church had been formulating since the fifth century. It is this fact that gives the work its status as a 'landmark' in the history of political thought.
