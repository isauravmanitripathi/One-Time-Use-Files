## MAKING FRIENDS, INFLUENCING PEOPLE

### Why India Must Create a Global Constituency

 $r$  n its quest to become a leading power, India has to successfully navigate the two big contradictions of our times, even while steadily enhancing its comprehensive national power. One is the East–West divide that has been sharpened by the Ukraine conflict. The other is the North–South gap that has been aggravated by Covid, debt, climate change as well as food and energy insecurity. This is on top of the natural compulsion of a rising power to maximize its friends and minimize its problems. India's search for ideal positioning in the global arena may be an unceasing effort. But those with larger ambitions must definitely develop reliable partners and assured sources of support. Their endeavour is also to shape the landscape rather than just operate in it.

The days when India could stir itself episodically while allowing processes to make their own progress are now behind us. Our interests are only expanding with time, and so must our activities and profile. The task before us is to lay the foundations in the *Amrit Kaal* for India to not only be a developed nation but also a leading power. That is why *Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas* (working with all for the progress of all) is as relevant in foreign policy as in the domestic one. After all, diplomacy is all about making friends and influencing people. And the scope for a country that has a natural inclination to treat the world as a family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) is immense in this regard.

In India, the term 'Rama–Lakshmana' is popularly used as an expression for describing closeness between siblings. But transpose this to the domain of global politics and reflect on its implications. The fact is that every Rama needs a Lakshmana, someone trustworthy and vigilant who will share both successes and sorrows. At crucial moments, he provided courage, counselled composure and steadied his principal. When the demon Viradh kidnapped Sita in Dandakaranya forest, it was Lakshmana who exhorted a shaken Rama to take swift counter-action. When Rama vented his frustration after Ravana's more successful abduction, it was again his brother who narrated how others dealt with misfortune through patience and fortitude. Thereafter, as Rama lost his cool with the seagod Varuna, who would not allow him to cross into Lanka, it was Lakshmana who persuaded him not to intimidate the god more than necessary. How to build close and reliable partnerships is the perennial task of diplomacy.

Every nation, however large or powerful, needs such sources of support. They may have a situational salience but the fact is that once established, such relationships have multiple ways of making themselves valuable. This is obviously a far cry from the normally transactional nature of international relations. It requires generosity, care, consideration and, sometimes, even affection. There is even some place for sentiment in world affairs, illustrated by that adage of blood being thicker than water. The solidarity of shared experiences is no weak bond either. India opened its heart through Vaccine Maitri, it was a gesture that will stand it in good stead for a long time. Indeed, as it rises up the global hierarchy of power, the requirement for reliable friends will grow, not lessen. The broader the footprint and greater the interests, the more is the importance of Lakshmanas.

The unstinted devotion of another player may be a relative rarity in real life, but significant enterprises in global history generally require assembling a larger coalition of support. This is particularly so when the nature and outcome of endeavours are open-ended. As activities are taking place far away from one's zone of familiarity, the value of associates goes up commensurately. This is further enhanced if they bring a particular skill or contribution to the collective effort. When confronting a larger or unusual opponent, the need for allies and wellwishers is still more keenly felt. We have seen this even in modern history, whether we think back to the World Wars, the Gulf War, Afghanistan or even ongoing situations. In the case of Rama, he was utterly at a loss to even guess how and where his abducted wife could have been taken. He finally tracked her through the multiple contributions of well-wishers and allies of various kinds. It does not always take a combat situation for this to be realized. In the competitive world of international politics, each friend who stands up in a difficult situation is one to be prized.

The coalition of *vanaras* that set out in every direction to gather intelligence is an equally powerful example of such sentiment. It was the force under Prince Angada, which had gone south, that learnt of Sita being in the gardens of Lanka. Without the army of monkeys, the bears and the eagles, Rama perhaps could not have got his bearings right. The need to be situationally aware when making important decisions is evident.

Often, some challenges may be beyond purely national capabilities and the contribution that well-wishers can make could be invaluable. Sampati's extraordinary sight is an analogy for accessing vital information about competitors and adversaries. And when the time came to cross the oceans, it was Nala, the bridge-building son of Vishwakarma, who provided the technology solution. Varuna went against his very nature in promising not to wash over the bridge that Nala built. This was the result of coercion by Rama, who in his anger, had threatened to dry up the seas if he was not allowed to cross.

Making friends and influencing people does involve a range of motivating factors, from incentives and flattery to assistance and threats. For most nations, this is an exceptionally patient and arduous task and may not be as easy as it seems. Generally speaking, it requires

an astute identification of its components and accommodation among competing interests. On exceptional occasions, there could even be difficult choices made for larger good. At the heart of one such case is the most debated action of Lord Rama in the epic. In an ongoing battle between the two sibling monkey chieftains, Vali and Sugriva, Rama intervened to kill the former. It was, of course, Vali's destiny to meet his end by divine hands and his own personal conduct was clearly not above reproach.

But the episode and its consequences offer important insights into undertaking larger operations. Viewed from a power perspective, Rama favoured the lesser entity, the younger brother Sugriva, who was earlier ousted from his position. Common sense indicates that the weaker side is always more welcoming of intervention and even more inclined to tie its fortunes on a lasting basis. Having gained the services of Sugriva, it was farseeing of Rama to maintain the unity of the *vanara*s by taking Vali's son, Angada, under his personal protection. Inspiring his allies to act with alacrity was no easy task either. Predictably, Sugriva went back to a good life in Kishkinda after assuming the throne, and it required Lakshmana's anger to remind him of his obligations.

The entire period when the *vanara* sena (army) is sent in multiple directions is also an experience of strategic patience for Rama and Lakshmana. The coalition must not just assemble but be given time to do its work, often at the speed of its less efficient components. Sometimes, partners may not be able to deliver in time. That was the case for Rama later on with Pratardana, the king of Kashi, whose promised legions did not arrive in time to join the battle in Lanka. But it is to Rama's credit that he publicly acknowledged their intent. In life, there is always a next time and diplomacy must never foreclose possibilities.

#### **THE PAST AND THE FUTURE**

As it goes about its business of rising in the international order, India has to bear in mind that the world is continuously changing, as indeed are its ties with various players. In the early years after Independence, we sought to build a relationship with the West while creating our decisional space. At the same time, constituencies in the developing world were nurtured by building on the obvious empathy of post-colonialism. Cooperation with the Socialist bloc was explored, with tangible outcomes in the economic and security spheres. As the pressures of the Cold War grew and Sino-US rapprochement unfolded, it compelled India to double down on its Soviet relationship. A large part of its difficulties with the West emanated from the preference that the latter showed for a military-ruled Pakistan.

It was, therefore, natural that the end of the Cold War would lead to readjustments on India's part and of the world towards India. These processes have gained steady momentum in the quarter of the century that has

passed. Their consolidation has been facilitated by the fact that in the last decade, New Delhi has shed much of the ideological baggage of the past. The US, in particular, is seen much more as part of the solution than of the problem. The diplomatic challenges now are one of advancing new relationships while retaining earlier ones. And, within that overall mix, assigning the appropriate weightage to specific ones, so that India gets the optimal results in a world that is under transformation.

Analysing India's ties with the five permanent members of the UNSC is a good place to start an assessment of both its record and its prospects. Those with the US and China are addressed in further chapters.

### *The UK: A Contemporary Compact*

More than any other relationship, India's ties with the UK carry the burden of a complex past. The scars of that period are both material and psychological. The challenge now is to make history work for the future of the relationship, where comforts and convergences overcome frictions and fissures.

Interestingly, it began as a symbiotic relationship in the immediate aftermath of India's independence. Current generations will probably be astonished at the extent of influence that the UK wielded in India for the next two decades. In fact, an Indian leadership anxious to stay out of the Cold War and keep the US at bay actually perceived the UK as its best foil. So much so that its radical segment even overcame initial reservations about joining the Commonwealth, believing that a British association would shield them from American pressure.

The recent success of the movie *RRR* is a reminder of how strongly feelings about the colonial era resonate with the Indian public even today. It is quite natural that there are sensitivities and wariness in the India–UK relationship that derive from this period. The partitioning of India may have left its own deep impact thereafter, but the subsequent India–Pakistan hyphenation clearly gave it even further life. Starting from 1947, when Pakistan attacked Jammu & Kashmir, the UK was perceived in New Delhi as being partial to Pakistan. This view, which grew further from the workings of the UNSC, was aggravated by the position that the UK took in the 1965 and 1971 conflicts. Britain's Cold War compulsions, the withdrawal from East of Suez and accession to the EU gradually eroded the proximity of the initial years. When it came to developments in Afghanistan after 2001, it did not

escape New Delhi's notice that Great Britain was the strongest advocate of dealing with the military leadership in Rawalpindi.

From the Indian perspective, whether it was the exercise of the nuclear option, a security concern like Afghanistan or the politics of the Indian subcontinent, British diplomacy was understandably viewed with suspicion. Moreover, as it gradually came into its own, the desire to put the past behind was also commensurately stronger in Indian politics. Weakening bonds between the elites as a result of deeper democratization of India accelerated the process. By the time Brexit arrived, the case for setting new terms of engagement was apparent.

While the past continues to cast its shadow, the present is not without its own complications. British politics is often driven by vote-bank considerations, though not to the extreme extent of Canada. And this has given space for secessionist forces targeting India to operate from its soil and misuse its freedoms. Ideological hostility in influential quarters against the current dispensation in India has also added to irritants. Some are visibly so resentful of changes in India that they do not wish to understand the reality. When the UK claims to have a special bond with India, its impact is all the more.

However, there is also a parallel reality of the two nations cooperating in a range of domains. This long-standing duality is one of the characteristics of the ties; whether the UK would follow the US to comprehensively reset it is the major question. Till now, the UK has lagged behind, but there is growing consciousness of the distance that this has created with India. Making adjustments requires introspection on a range of concerns, from political sensitivities and security issues to export controls and mobility. That this is no longer the India of the past should be evident by now. Whether it is replacing British-era legal codes, expressing its cultural beliefs or asserting the symbolism of Netaji, times are surely changing. Because of the close past association, it is particularly incumbent on the UK to appreciate the nature of this transformation.

On the other hand, it is also essential that Indians approach the future of this partnership more clinically. They must recognize that the UK has served as an effective gateway for Indian businesses in Europe and that it hosts a successful diaspora. Its global influence may not be the same, but it is still very real in parts of the world. In certain domains, British technology and capabilities are clearly world-class. From an Indian viewpoint, there is a

case for building further on the convergence that the two countries may currently have. That answer, once both countries put their mind to it, veers in a positive direction. This is reflected in their agreed 2030 Roadmap, among others.

Connecting the two countries and peoples can be pursued through different avenues, including closer political contacts, deeper economic and financial exchanges, greater skills and education flows, stronger research and innovation partnerships, and, of course, by nurturing the living bridge. Underlying this exercise is how we look at the world and grapple with issues that both nations confront every day.

The UK is a very different polity in the aftermath of Brexit. And some of these changes are precisely those that can provide impetus to a more contemporary partnership. Greater national control has allowed the UK to contemplate an Enhanced Trade Partnership with India. An agreement on a migration and mobility partnership helps to match demand, demographics and talent. The UK's Integrated Review locates it as a Euro-Atlantic actor, but with an increasing stake in the Indo-Pacific. That makes a compelling argument for a stronger understanding with India.

From India's viewpoint, there are many UKs that we seek to engage simultaneously: the Global Britain, the Atlantic UK, the post-European one, the City of London, the diaspora one, the innovation and education UK, and, of course, the strategic one. The internal balance among them has clearly shifted as a result of Brexit and the global aspect is now much more at the forefront. While refreshing their ties, India and the UK cannot ignore the issues carried forward from their history. But their conversation in the future will necessarily be different. In the final analysis, the true test of a transition to a new era will be in the ability to work together both on issues of the Indian subcontinent and the larger global stage.

## *Russia: A Steady Partnership*

The story with Russia (erstwhile USSR) has been very different. A power that was suspicious of the Indian national movement, often to the point of being downright hostile, developed increasing shared interests as post-Independence diplomacy took root. This picked up after 1953–54, especially once Pakistan joined US-led alliance systems. Many political parties in our country also viewed the USSR as a progressive force. For an India

increasingly worried about the Western arming of its neighbour, the relationship was both an insurance policy and an active contributor to our national strengths. It grew to a level where Russia's role, then as the USSR, was critical to a strategic inflection point in the Indian subcontinent in 1971.

The resulting goodwill, combined with a continuing sensitivity to India's interests, has kept these ties steady despite global tumult. Even the break-up of the USSR had limited impact, with the two nations re-discovering their mutual priority within a decade.

Today, it is this Indian relationship with Russia that is most on the global radar. In terms of significance, it compares in many respects to that with the US and China. Its economic content may be less, but for India, it has enormous strategic and security relevance. The unintended consequences of an unforeseen conflict, however, have paradoxically hastened some possibilities long under discussion. As a result, Russia could well emerge as a primary supplier of resources at the very time that India ramps up its economic growth and expands such needs.

The irony today about the partnership is that it is the subject of attention not because it has changed but because it has not. In fact, ties between Russia and India have been among the steadiest of the major relationships in the world after the Second World War. Each country has seen ups and downs in its ties with many other partners. Yet, for a variety of reasons, both have managed to insulate their own relationship from the volatility of global events. It appears that the logic of geopolitics combined with the mutuality of benefits have provided an exceptionally strong ballast to their ties.

If relations have been stable, this is not to say that either nation has remained static as a polity or even as a society. In the last quarter of a century, India has grown to emerge as the fifth largest economy, a nuclear weapon power, a technology centre, a reservoir of global talent and an active shaper of international debates. Its interests and influence have grown well beyond the Subcontinent.

Russia has, meanwhile, defined itself more nationally, with the accompanying changes in orientation and priorities. Its inherent character as a Eurasian power and its global status make it salient to the world order. Russia has also demonstrated an ability to influence outcomes across regions and issues. Its importance in domains like energy, resources and technology remains noteworthy.

The last three decades have seen the autonomous evolution of both Russia and India. They may have forged partnerships with others that may not always be convergent. Their own bilateral balance and equation have also developed with time. Yet, there appears to be a continued intersection of interests built on a legacy of goodwill that shapes their thinking about each other. What has made a difference is that they have taken great care even in a changing world not to act in a manner that adversely affects the core interests of the other. Preserving that is obviously crucial.

Though coming from different histories and geographies, India and Russia conceptually share a commitment to a multipolar world and have gravitated towards its establishment as a global modus vivendi. Their understanding of that may not be exactly the same when applied across geographies. Precisely because Russia is a Eurasian power, it is essential for India that it appreciates a multipolar world must have a multipolar Asia at its core. The operating principle of such a world is the legitimate pursuit of partnerships without seeking exclusivity. Two nations that have such a strong sense of independence should have less difficulty in appreciating the intent of the other. While Russia has stakes in the larger direction of global change, it is also a polity that has deep interests in the current international architecture. An important aspect of the future of our ties is the extent to which this accommodates India's rise.

Given the history of their ties, Indians would have expectations of Russian support, including on the reform of the UNSC. The Ukraine conflict has also led Russia to reassess its traditional focus westwards. Its consequential shift towards Asia is already visible on the economic front. For India, that will broaden an engagement that, till now, was almost exclusively reliant on the triad of military, nuclear and space cooperation.

In the coming years, the focus with Russia can be expected to shift, capturing its Asian facets more and more. The outlines of that have started to emerge. It could be connectivity like the International North–South Transport Corridor or the Chennai–Vladivostok maritime route and greater Indian involvement in the Russian Far East, or perhaps closer collaboration in Central Asia and the Arctic. All in all, India–Russia ties are poised for evolution even as they maintain their trajectory.

In very different ways, the British and Russian relationships evoke emotions with the Indian public. But policy, while not impervious to sentiment, is finally driven by empirical facts and a cost–benefit analysis. As

India takes stock of a transforming landscape and seeks to chart its way forward, adjustments are only to the expected.

## *France: The Third Way*

In contrast to the UK and Russia, France is a relatively newer diplomatic discovery, one whose colonial past has receded more in public consciousness. The minimal overhang of history offers it opportunities, just as its focus encourages growth of select domains.

For two decades now, this relationship has been steadily advancing, free from surprises and shifts triggered by external factors. The two nations not only share values and beliefs but put considerable emphasis on building national capabilities. Both of them navigated the Cold War era trying to maximize their strategic space. In modern times, they have developed strong convergences that go back to the 1950s. Since then, succeeding generations of French platforms and equipment have been an integral part of the Indian military force. India, therefore, has good reasons to see it as a major partner for its national security.

France was also an important influence in the development of India's strategic thinking, especially its nuclear-force posture. Indeed, the very concept of credible minimum deterrence was derived from the learnings of the French experience. Not just that, after the 1998 nuclear tests, this nation was the first nuclear power to show an understanding of our strategic compulsions. So, it was no surprise that PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee made Paris his first bilateral stop after the nuclear tests. Along with President Jacques Chirac, he launched the strategic partnership between our two countries that still serves us well till today. French support played an important role in India getting an exemption from the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in 2008 to resume international cooperation in civil nuclear energy.

In the UNSC and other international forums, where competing and complex sets of interests affect choices, France has been a consistent partner. Our synergies have enabled us, for example, to be more effective in mobilizing UN action against terrorism and terrorist groups. France has also been a forthright supporter of India's case for permanent membership of the UNSC.

In the past few years, the uncertainties and disequilibrium of a world in transition have encouraged a stronger sense of common strategic purpose. Among the current priorities, one is to cooperate more closely in the Indo-Pacific, where India is in the middle and France present at its bookends. It is revealing that the two nations have entered into trilaterals with Australia and the UAE recently.

For India, in recent years, ties with France fit the challenge of 'rightsizing' its crucial partners. A nation that espouses the Third Way also holds an intuitive appeal to an independent-minded India. Its autonomy and selfreliance resonate strongly, as does its reticence on bringing in larger concerns. Once the two nations consciously decided to make this a foundation, their collaboration grew steadily over multiple regimes. As a result, in the pursuit of its larger aspirations, India has found in France another significant player committed to multipolarity.

However, while the long-standing insistence by both India and France to maintain their decisional freedom may produce convergences, each will have its own perspective. After all, they are located in very different geographies that will naturally decide both priorities and interests.

Like every other relationship, this one, too, will require assiduous tending. What should give most cause for optimism is that they have actually set out a perspective of cooperation for Horizon 2047.

The P-3 examples of the UK, Russia and France may be contrasting, but they do bring out the intrinsic value of the relationships. The fact is that permanent members of the UNSC have an importance much beyond that body. Nurturing these ties is, therefore, all the more important as India's interests unfold across the world.

#### **RESETTING WITH THE WEST**

Since international relations is simultaneously a collective and national activity, it is perhaps worthwhile to assess India's approach to the West as a whole. Understandably, some of that remains coloured by the experience of colonialism. That said, it is also a fact that this era has facilitated elite bonding to a considerable degree.

The one Western country that could have escaped the colonial taint was the US. It, however, blotted its copybook in India by strongly aligning with the Pakistani military and, thereafter, with China. These negatives were

nevertheless set off against the substantive economic, technological and societal linkages that were built up after India's independence. Interestingly, even the political frictions were sometimes mitigated by circumstances. India may not have always been treated as a friend but was not regarded as a foe either.

The very same nations that evoked anxiety through their geopolitics were the ones that stepped forward after the 1962 conflict with China. Their contribution to infrastructure creation and agricultural self-sufficiency also cannot be underestimated. Our stance towards the Western bloc as a whole was influenced by the totality of these experiences and considerations.

Looking back, it is telling that for the first few decades, India's preferred partners in the Anglosphere were the UK and Canada. Indeed, much of its early international forays took place in tandem with them, the mediations on Korea and Vietnam being prominent examples. The US was, of course, an overwhelming presence, but one long regarded with suspicion due to our ideological proclivities as much as strategic calculations.

A measurement of the distance that India's foreign policy has travelled over 75 years is also in changed attitudes in this respect. The more we got beyond the romanticism of the early years and viewed the world through the lens of hard realities, the greater was the merit that was discovered in partners hitherto kept at a distance. This was accelerated when India started looking eastwards and developing an Indo-Pacific agenda. As a result, it is now the US and Australia that are assessed as having critical value, including at the Quad. If there is a pointer here, it is that the alignment of geopolitical outlook is so central to the development of ties. Indo-Pacific strategies now offer a contemporary pathway in that regard.

Challenges, however, are not with just individual nations. India's relationship with the West as a whole needs an objective evaluation. In many ways, this group is a natural partner because its members share the attributes of a pluralistic society, democratic polity and market economy. Yet, this very commonness can also create its own frictions. The continuing hegemonism visible in many quarters in the West leads to an excessive advocacy of their particular practices and convictions. Often, it is lost on them that others have different traditions, practices and yardsticks, and that the West itself would not necessarily come out well if they were evaluated objectively and publicly. Moreover, these attitudes do not stop at advocacy and extend to promoting an actionable agenda as well. That comes into conflict with postcolonial polities like India, which are reasserting their identities and standing their ground.

There are developmental frictions as well, as those more advanced seek to protect their leads. This is evident in the domains of trade, climate, patents and cross-border transactions, among others. At the heart of the contestation with the West is the tension between those who have dominated for long and others who now seek to challenge. The promotion of a rules-based order is regularly advocated, just as respect for the UN Charter is frequently invoked. But for all the talk, it is still largely Western nations that shape the agenda and define the norms. A fairer and less selective application of rules in various domains is, therefore, very much part of rebalancing. If global conversations have become more animated of late, much of it emanates from the courage to call out what is unacceptable. But for all these differences, the fact remains that those Asian nations have progressed fastest who have done so in partnership with the West.

For India, there are lessons to be learnt from how East and Southeast Asian nations leveraged geopolitics to accelerate national development. This is particularly relevant in our contemporary era of polarization. After all, no relationship is conducted without context, and the immediate one must inform India's choices even more than the distant.

In the discourses of Delhi, the term 'strategic autonomy' is usually defined as keeping a distance from the West, especially the US. The irony is that this has led us instead to develop deep dependencies elsewhere. The same logic applied in the case of non-alignment too. As we now move into a capable and confident era, it is important that our outlook is determined more by our interests and less by our insecurities.

Going by common sense, Indians must ask themselves which geographies give better access to their products and talents. As a long-term trend, there is also a fit between Western demand and Indian demographics that will help shape the global knowledge economy. Political choices, therefore, should not be divorced from those of economics, sociology or culture. There may be a process of subtle contestation between India and a world largely shaped by the West. Some of that may also show up in hedging, a phenomenon well established in the political domain. But here too, there are good reasons to be discerning and deliberate, rather than allow an attitude to become a strategy. India may be non-West but must realize that there is little profit in being anti-West.

Certainly, a calculation to broaden partners and ensure maximum benefits is an obvious one. But increasingly, in a tech-driven world, not all choices can be straddled or sidestepped. This is particularly so in respect of the digital domain and critical and emerging technologies. And while engaged in that exercise, the global scenario itself must also be clinically assessed from our perspective. Convergences and contradictions can be systemic in certain domains.

Developing affinities with the West will definitely pay well in the era of the knowledge economy. It is, therefore, crucial that we approach the larger issue as much with our heads as with our hearts. Eventually, new compacts will come into being that could more accurately reflect rebalancing and multipolarity.

The attention that the Modi government has devoted to building ties with Europe is a significant departure from the passivity of the preceding decades. Earlier, Indian diplomacy mostly concentrated on larger states, especially the UK, France and Germany. This continues to a certain degree, but there is now a more sustained focus on the EU as a collective body, and also sub-regions and smaller states. Regular India–EU summits have done much to change the atmosphere, leading to the resumption of FTA negotiations.

For India, Germany is clearly the account where there is visible space for further growth. Till now, much of that country's attention has been on other parts of Asia. That could well change somewhat in the light of new strategic circumstances. Indeed, it is the progress with the India–Germany relationship which could make the difference with that of the EU as a whole.

Among the sub-regions, the Nordic engagement has been particularly prominent, delivering results in the political and economic domains. The Mediterranean one, including Italy and Greece, has been less collective but still enthusiastic and impactful. It could acquire a new significance in the context of IMEC. The MMPA with Portugal was particularly timely in catalysing the rest of the EU.

Reinforcing relations with Central and Eastern Europe remains a work in progress, and different formats are being explored. Indian energies have also been expended in the Baltic and the Caucasus, including through the opening of embassies.

Handling the East–West contradiction is today one of the major challenges for Indian diplomacy. But the East is not a simple proposition for India. After the first decade of Independence, that has never been India's

preference. Its relationship with Russia has been qualitatively different from its ties with China. It is clearly not helpful for India if the two are perceived to be in the same basket. From time to time, efforts have been made to advance such an analysis and India, on its part, has refused to be drawn in. There has been no competitive element at all in its relationship with Russia. On the contrary, it is the continuous consideration that the two countries have extended to each other that has been the foundation of their partnership. Where China is concerned, it is a very different story, in part due to the unresolved boundary question. Therefore, India's geopolitical posture will not be amenable to the extrapolation of the Indo-Pacific into Europe, and it is essential that we get the West to understand this logic of strategy.

While countries are naturally impelled by their national interest, it is also true that this positioning can help to mitigate global frictions when the time comes. This has been already evident in the workings of the G20 and some other international platforms. Indeed, it could even be asserted that calming the global discourse and stabilizing the global economy is in itself a contribution to common good.

#### **THE AFRICAN SOLIDARITY**

When PM Modi announced at the New Delhi G20 Summit the membership of the AU in that body, it was a very special moment for India–Africa ties. A year before, he had made that commitment in Bali and, thereafter, took it up personally and seriously with other G20 leaders. To many African countries, it was natural that India should step forward and advance their cause.

Yet, the fact remains that the story of India–Africa relations is a relatively uncommented one. It is often forgotten that there is a really long history of contacts, whether fostered by the dhow or the caravan. The period of Western colonialism added its own texture, creating the beginnings of an Indian diaspora in that continent. The subsequent independence struggles have generated a unique solidarity that is still on display in global forums.

As with many other regions, what was a steady but unremarkable relationship got a quantum jump due to PM Modi's personal interest. Perhaps this also reflected the extensive contacts that his home state of Gujarat had with this region. A clear approach to cooperation with the continent was articulated by him in July 2018 in an address to the Ugandan Parliament. Its essence was that India would respond to Africa's priorities, demands and

needs rather than unilaterally propose an agenda. Since 2014, there have been 34 outgoing visits by the Indian president, vice president and PM to Africa, and more than a hundred incoming ones at the same level. The IAFS of 2015 laid out particularly ambitious targets for cooperation.

A decade later, despite the interruption by Covid, much of that was agreed upon has been delivered in terms of projects, capabilities, training and exchanges. Apart from practical collaboration, the solidarity with Africa is best expressed by how strongly India has pushed for its membership of the G20.

To date, India has done about 200 projects in Africa, with 65 more under execution and 81 in the works. Many of these projects were the first of their kind in Africa. Some are truly iconic in nature such as the Tema–Mpakadan Railway and Presidential Palace in Ghana, National Assembly building in Gambia, the Rivatex textile factory in Kenya, the Metro Express project in Mauritius and the Mahatma Gandhi International Convention Centre in Niger.

The narrative in other related domains has also been encouraging. More than 40,000 scholarships have been extended since the last IAFS meeting. A pan-Africa e-network launched a decade ago is supplemented by the e-VidyaBharti and e-ArogyaBharti initiatives on distant education and health respectively. We are today Africa's fourth-largest trade partner and fifthlargest investor. India's contribution of vaccines, medicines and equipment was particularly crucial during the Covid pandemic. The discussion is increasingly now on digital delivery, green growth and affordable health as the three themes of future development collaboration.

#### **THE BRIDGES NOT TOO FAR**

While Africa has been the main focus of lines of credit and grant assistance, India's growing footprint in Latin America is also worth noting. From being perceived as a faraway destination, that continent is gaining salience as a supplier of energy, natural resources and food. Its expanding middle class are natural customers for Indian products in pharmaceuticals and vehicles. The Indian IT industry is also firmly entrenched in the Latin American market. If the overall trade turnover is growing so rapidly, then the seriousness of our presence cannot be ignored. Currently, India is among the top five trade partners of both Brazil and Argentina. Indian investments are growing apace in diverse sectors, matching the strengthening political collaboration. In the

task of making friends and influencing people, Latin America is no longer a bridge too far.

The example of Pacific Islands is a reflection of how much India's reach has extended in the last decade. But it is equally a reminder of what awaits it: a more intensified engagement with regions that are not proximate. Within this period, India has undertaken three summit-level meetings with Pacific Island countries, the most recent being in 2023 in Papua New Guinea. While the warmth of that reception got public attention, what is also important to appreciate is a development agenda that is demand-driven. Much of it focussed on the acute health priorities of the Pacific region. Indian commitments included a super-speciality hospital in Fiji, Jaipur Foot camps, dialysis units and sea ambulances in all member states and centres for supply of cost-effective pharmaceuticals. The digital deficit was also sought to be bridged by creating an IT hub in Papua New Guinea. A warehouse to host geo-spatial data sets was launched, alongside a centre for sustainable coastal and ocean research. Ongoing endeavours at solarization and community skillbuilding will also be taken forward.

Many Pacific nations were vocally appreciative of Indian assistance during the Covid pandemic, and all of them clearly saw merit in its climateaction initiatives. That Indian calculations have started to focus on a region where there were previously only tenuous contacts obviously speaks of an expanding horizon. But it also underlines how integrated global politics has now become and the importance of extending one's hand generously.

In a different quarter of the world, a similar story has begun to unfold in respect of the Caribbean Community, where there is a significant diaspora as well. Here again, a long-standing but low-key relationship is being energized through development projects, larger investments, enhanced trade and focussed capacity building. Enabling this through a politically-led framework is also beginning to yield results. The Covid pandemic provided an opportunity for India to display solidarity in a manner that will resonate for long.

#### **NEIGHBOURHOOD: TRULY FIRST**

Even as it spreads its wings, a rising India must remain focussed on its immediate neighbourhood and the extended one. The current decade has seen a radical improvement in India's linkages as a result of the Neighbourhood

First policy. Whether it is rail, road, air or waterway connectivity; supply of energy; restoration of heritage; construction of housing; or expansion of capacities, India has demonstrated the value of its friendship. Neighbours are increasingly realizing that India can be a source of prosperity for them as well. In difficult times, especially during Covid, their well-being was greatly enhanced by contributions from India. Those who faced serious balance of payments crisis, like Sri Lanka, could also turn to India for support. As a result, the sense of regional togetherness has grown steadily.

That has also been the case with the regions a little more extended from India. ASEAN has discovered in India a firm advocate of its centrality and cohesion. The agenda of cooperation has widened to cover connectivity, development assistance, research and education, as well as security. The Gulf has seen a degree of attention that has been missing for the last four decades. The stresses of the Covid period have only intensified this growing closeness. The levels of investment, trade and strategic collaboration have improved markedly.

With Central Asia, too, the template of comprehensive engagement announced in 2022 has opened up possibilities in a wide range of domains. Indian capacities and partners are being explored with a much greater sense of enthusiasm.

As for the island neighbours of the Indian Ocean, they have seen India come through in both difficult and routine times. The overall picture that emerges is now of an India that is more engaged, more responsible, more contributive and, therefore, more reliable.

## **GLOBAL SOUTH AND GLOBAL GOOD**

As it ascends the international hierarchy, India speaks not just for itself but for a larger Global South constituency as well. The last few years have been particularly tough on developing countries. The impact of Covid was much harder, whether in terms of health accessibility or affordability. That they were then subjected to travel restraints added insult to injury. Already fragile economies reeled under the weight of lockdowns and disruptions, made worse by growing debt and declining trade. The knock-on effects of the Ukraine conflict have added to the woes, especially when it comes to 3F prices. In many regions, terrorism has been endemic along with its economic costs. Developing societies are also more vulnerable to extreme climate

events that we are witnessing with greater frequency. Whether it is the 2030 Agenda or climate commitments, there is growing concern about the ability to sustain progress.

In all of this, India is widely perceived to be an exemplar in many areas. Developing countries also expect a nation like India to articulate their concerns in forums where they may not be present. For India, this is both a moral responsibility as well as an expression of global strategy. After all, the re-balancing process will extend beyond its current beneficiaries, and India is well served by investing deeply in the Global South.

There are also occasions when friends are won and opinions influenced by doing greater good. Some of it again may be directly relevant to national interest. But there is more expected of India as its capabilities grow. In recent years, we have been effective in providing succour in situations ranging from the Türkiye and Nepal earthquakes and Yemen civil war to mudslides in Sri Lanka and floods in Mozambique. The Covid period too saw intensification in international collaboration, be it the Vaccine Maitri for 100 partners, supply of medicines or equipment to 150 countries, or indeed the deployment of Indian personnel in the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar, Seychelles, Comoros and Kuwait.

Beyond emergency situations, however, India can help make the world safer and more secure by contributing to the well-being of the global commons. This could take the form of the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) that India announced at the East Asia Summit in 2019. This has since gathered momentum with a growing list of partnering nations. It could be the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA), which will focus on challenges like illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Or indeed the Quad itself, which has taken on responsibilities ranging from collaborative connectivity and pandemic response to emerging and critical technologies. There are also practical examples of demonstrating climate action in which India has played a crucial role. The same spirit drives India's championing of the International Year of Millets. This could have substantial implications for food security and greener agriculture, especially for Africa.

Many elements of the logic that drives India's engagement with Africa also apply to its larger approach to the Global South. There is a broad message of empathy and solidarity, but their expressions could be specific to the region or the country involved. It is visible in multilateral forums through

platforms like the G-77, Non-Aligned Movement or the L.69 Group. With Small Island Developing States, this is evident in development projects, renewable energy spread and disaster resilience efforts.

At a time when much of the world has fallen back to a nationalism of an earlier era, enlightened Indian interests dictate that it puts even greater emphasis on internationalism. This is made easier by the fact that in Indian tradition, there has never been tension between the two. The presidency of the G20 provides just the right platform for this message to be driven home.

It is not just that important bilateral relations have started to get the attention that they long deserved. There are also more innovative group engagements at various levels. In the immediate and extended neighbourhood, we can see that in the East Asia Summit platforms, Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and a Central Asia collective engagement. Beyond that, there are the IAFS, the Arab League dialogue, the SCO, the Pacific Islands Forum, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). Dealings with Europe have acquired a new intensity, not just with the EU but also with constituent members like the Nordic countries or the Slavkov format. The Commonwealth remains a long-standing commitment while the G20 has evolved into a growing priority. All of these are backed up by a plethora of ad hoc arrangements, like the BRICS, RIC, IBSA, Quad, I2U2 and multiple trilaterals. In addition, there are some key bilaterals and certain specific regions that will determine the smoothness of India's rise.

India has now entered a new phase of a multi-vector engagement that seeks to maximize outcomes and benefits. Its results have heightened its profile and changed its image. As a consequence, it is today perceived as a source of ideas, a champion of causes, a driver of initiatives and an advocate of consensus. No country or region is now seen as irrelevant to India's global calculus. Each of these examples highlights the importance of making friends and influencing people. This generous, intensive and enlightened engagement with the world is key to Bharat's journey towards becoming a leading power.
