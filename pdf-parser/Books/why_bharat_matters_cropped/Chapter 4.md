## BACK TO THE FUTURE

## As National Security Balances Globalization

ill 2014, like the rest of the world, much of India too was lulled by the soothing sounds of globalization First care D the European experiment. Soon thereafter was the election of Donald Trump and the articulation of *America First*. A Chinaâ€“US tussle, which was supposedly only tactical, became truly serious with the passage of time. Each episode enhanced the realization of the vulnerabilities that economic and technology concentrations had created. Then came the Covid pandemic, which thoroughly exposed the hollowing out of so many economies in the name of global efficiency. A new consensus began to emerge on the importance of resilient and reliable supply chains, as also on digital trust and transparency. A legacy issue, meanwhile, ground to an abrupt end with the hasty exit of American troops from Afghanistan. This was followed by the Ukraine conflict whose global impact confirmed how deeply integrated we all now are. And not least, the West Asia tinder box saw our worst fears realized with a new level of conflagration.

So, we have the revival of all the negatives of global politics that were thought only recently as anachronistic. Did we really not see it coming? Were we in denial? Perhaps some combination of both, enhanced by strong vested interests, their ability to lull the international community and a human propensity to hope for the best. All that globalization optimists were convinced was behind us has now returned with a bang. World politics is struggling with the intense interdependence of technology, finance, trade and resources coexisting with the overwhelming compulsions of security, sovereignty, privacy and values. The former pulls us towards developing closer linkages, while the latter cautions us about its vulnerable consequences. Navigating these contradictions will surely challenge all our creativity because the tensions of the present now collide with the prospects

of the future. From its messy outcomes could emerge a different architecture of international cooperation, one that is more sensitive to values and interests as much as to employment and culture.

It was not as if the twenty-first century began particularly well. Almost at its very start, the 9/11 attacks in New York shaped its global direction. Their consequences then consumed the world for the next two decades. Much of what unfolded could hardly have been anticipated then, including how the preoccupations of one power could help open up the pathway for another. Soon thereafter, an unnecessary conflict in Iraq led to even more unpredictable outcomes. On the economic front, a world that was recovering from an Asian financial crisis slid into a global one within a decade.

The entry of China into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 heralded a model of globalization that was to have profound political and social repercussions in many societies. Quite a few found themselves unable to compete for reasons of scale, nature of the model, or against such massive subsidies. The resulting hollowing out obviously created its own politics in due course.

As these long trends unfolded, different regions and countries grappled with their individual challenges and opportunities. Greater sensitivity to employment, protection of technologies and safeguarding of data in a digital world were notable concerns. In a more connected existence, their domestic churnings also began to be reflected more strongly on the global stage.

By the time we reached the end of the second decade, it was clear that the very fundamentals of the world order were shifting. Trend lines indicated a movement towards greater turbulence and big power contestation, challenging assumptions with which we were comfortable. What no one expected was that an already troubled world would get a 'once in a century' shock in the form of a pandemic. When we add the consequences of Afghanistan and Ukraine, the future looks even more open-ended. It is certainly a new world out there, quite definitely not a brave one.

### **SHARPENING GREAT POWER COMPETITION**

Prominent among the postulates that have shaped our thinking is the centrality of the US to the current international system. It is evident, however, that the two 'forever wars' in Afghanistan and Iraq have greatly affected that polity. That one was marked by conceptual confusion and the other was altogether

avoidable is beside the point. The rationale of both conflicts may continue to be debated by those still interested. But what is done is done, and the US has come out much worse.

There was also a parallel economic pressure growing in this very period, one paradoxically created by the US on itself. The globalization model that many Americans advocated for so fervently has had a corrosive impact on its own strengths and capabilities. The last and obviously weakest justification for its continuation is that of the importance of the dependencies that it has already created. But the implications for American manufacturing prowess and technology leads were visible enough to be expressed, first as a political backlash and, thereafter, as a national security challenge. The Trump presidency certainly marked a turning point, but many of the debates matured further during the Biden Administration to emerge as a systemic posture. The net outcome of these developments is a strategic evolution of the US that is reflected in a changing stance abroad and different terms of engagement that it now offers to the world.

This is not a situation that has emerged overnight. On the contrary, rhetoric notwithstanding, we have seen a growing caution in US power projection since 2008. In tandem, there have been persistent efforts to address its overextension. In fact, there is a consistency in this regard over three Administrations that it may not readily admit to. Whether it is footprint, extent of involvement or the nature of activities, we are witnessing a very different America. And this America is moving towards greater realism, both about itself and the world, as it seeks to achieve global objectives in a more cost-effective manner. It could assume a broader posture as an off-shore balancer in more regions in a way that protects its influence without expanding its risks. This has different aspects, key among them a striving for a better balance between its domestic revival and its external obligations.

There is a sharper recognition, too, of an emerging multipolarity and growing strategic autonomy that characterizes the current era. This impels a quest for new options, even while consolidating old relationships. There is also not only an acute consciousness of the challenges to its position but a realization that these have made much headway. The real question is the ability of the US to reassess and reinvent itself. What this means to the world is a new kind of diplomacy, one more in tune with an awareness of its limitations and, consequently, of the value of greater and more contemporary partnerships.

Even as all of this happens, the world also witnesses the rise of China. Indeed, this correlation between the fortunes of the two nations is difficult to dispute. The emergence of a power at a global level is a unique happening in any circumstance. That this is a 'different' kind of polity, both ideologically and culturally, enhances the sense of change. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) may have borne some similarities, but it never had the salience to the global economy that China has today. We are, therefore, contemplating scenarios very different from the post-1945 situation.

The consequences of China's growing capabilities are particularly significant because of the extrapolation of its domestic seamlessness to the world outside. As a result, whether it is connectivity, technology or trade, there is now an ongoing debate on the changed nature of power and influence. Separately, we have also seen a sharpening of tensions on territorial issues across the breadth of Asia. Agreements and understandings of yesteryears now seem to have developed question marks. India had its own experiences, especially in 2020, with regard to the border situation.

Time will, of course, provide more answers. But what is evident is that establishing a multipolar Asia as a foundation of a multipolar world is now more urgent than before. Obviously, much of this will happen in the backdrop of intensified great power competition, and understanding how that could unfold is, therefore, vital. Here too, the Ramayana has some instructive insights.

Among the backstories of the Ramayana is the competition between two sages, one who can be regarded as an entrenched power and the other as a rising one. Their rivalry originated in an attempt by King Kaushika to forcibly seize Sage Vasistha's particularly productive cow. In the fight that followed, all his sons and his entire army were destroyed. Kaushika then acquired formidable weapons through penance but was again unsuccessful in his attacks on Vasistha. He then intensified his prayers and steadily moved up the ranks of the sages. But in the process, he discovered that rising was not such an easy task, especially to the summit level. Moreover, his besetting weakness was a tendency to lose his temper and expend his powers on the immediate provocation. And those happened to be many, some deriving from his enmity towards Vasistha, but others being distractions deliberately put in his way. Not content with being recognized by Lord Brahma as a '*rajarishi*', he ultimately pushed himself to attain the highest status of '*brahmarishi*'. But even then, Kaushika was not satisfied until he heard this recognition from the lips of Vasistha himself.

This tale of the two sages has some resemblance to developments in current world affairs. Rising powers are constantly pushing themselves, with the established one as the standard to be matched. Some may be driven by memories of humiliation, even if others are more at peace with themselves. In this process of reordering, only gaining the respect of competitors is not always enough. There is equally a deep desire to be formally acknowledged as an equal. The fire inside, which drives such a quest, can encourage a mentality of winning at any cost. And that, today, is understandably the biggest challenge to the establishment of a rules-based order. Not to forget, entrenched powers such as Sage Vasistha have a deeper influence that cannot be easily overcome.

If there is another trait that has carried on uninterrupted in history, it is that of political suspicion. Much as they may deny, even the closest of partners watch each other for contrary signs. It is a moot question whether the absence of her own son Bharata on the day of Rama's coronation added to Queen Kaikeyi's anxieties about his (and her) future. Certainly, these thoughts would have been magnified by her evil help Manthara, who had instigated her to make unreasonable demands by invoking the two boons given by King Dasaratha. This, incidentally, is also a telling example of how a smaller player with their own agenda can take advantage of the insecurities of a larger one. We can see that happening in our own neighbourhood.

But personalities aside, the hard realities that underpin international relations are those of competition and benefits. For all the talk of globalization and common good, nations still calculate unsentimentally what is to their particular advantage. The world may be changing but, in some respects, the more it does, the more it remains the same.

#### **BEYOND WESTPHALIAN POLITICS**

While it is natural to visualize the developments pertaining to the US and China in a related manner, it would nevertheless be an oversimplification to see them as a zero-sum game. To begin with, both of them are aspects of a larger rebalancing that is taking place in the world. Certainly, they have impacted each other and there are causal connections. American retrenchment has provided greater space to Chinese influence, given that it extends across so many domains. As much of the world put the colonial period behind, new centres of economic activities inevitably came into being. Of course, the pace and quality of this transformation was shaped by political choices, especially of the US.

China may have been a particular beneficiary of the geopolitics of the last century. But the fact remains that the shortfalls on the American account today cannot be readily filled by the growth of China's capabilities. Some of that reflects from the sheer spread of the US and its extensive grip on the

international order. But there is also the crucial difference in the very nature of the two polities.

The US has prided itself on its universalism and consciously promoted these traits. China, in contrast, considers itself singular and its globalization is not readily converted into universalization. Each will play to its strengths. In an interesting way, the two will be a study in contrasts. One will make the most of its openness and diversity while building on its unique ability to attract global talent; the other has developed formidable strengths by leveraging the world, even while developing autonomous capabilities through extraordinary fusion. Paradoxically, a challenge that awaits them both is to ensure that these very qualities are not exploited by the other.

What is relevant for our purpose is the lessening convergence in their respective world views. And what that will lead to is a period of uncertainty, limitations and frictions in world affairs. This will be most evident on global connects like supply chains and data flows as well as challenges like maritime security, pandemics and terrorism. After all, we have a situation where not just the distribution of power has undergone a change, but along with it the characteristics of those who will now wield greater influence. Quite apart from their ability to work together or not, how they view enlightened self-interest and how much that would propel them to contribute to safeguarding the global commons are the questions that await answers.

It is not just eastwards in the Indo-Pacific that India is witnessing a radically different situation. Towards the West, the politics of our proximate region is also undergoing a transformation with the American exit from Afghanistan. Diplomats in the UN may have articulated the concerns of the international community in terms of terrorism and radicalization, treatment of women and minorities, freedom to travel and inclusive governance. But strategists with an understanding of the region would also be forced to recognize how open-ended its prospects have become. The balance of values, ideologies and interests are being carefully weighed by all relevant parties.

Just beyond, another change in the making arises from the transition in American Administrations and the negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme and regional influence. Where that finds a landing point is of no small consequence. Paradoxically, West Asia has witnessed simultaneously a radical departure from past political battle lines as well as their intensification. The optimism of the Abraham Accords has been countered by

the terrorist attacks on Israel. The resulting balance, however transitory, is still far from clear. What can be safely asserted is that this time around, the very underpinnings of West Asian politics are being transformed.

Quite autonomously, Western liberal politics is also increasingly at odds with regime comfort in some nations. It has triggered reappraisals that are enhanced by evolving global dynamics. On its part, the Abraham Accords are noteworthy not only for their departure from entrenched positions but for the promise that they hold, especially on economic and connectivity issues. The I2U2, a new grouping, contains the kernel of ideas that could suggest a greater Indian involvement. And that need not be the only game in town. Saudi Arabia's greater focus on Asia also offers openings for India. This includes the IMEC initiative with possibilities of cooperation in connectivity, logistics and energy. Building on a tradition of contacts between India and Europe that went through Arabia, it represents a 'return of history'. In the final analysis, the balance between entrenched politics and emerging economics will determine the region's relevance to the world beyond.

Insofar as Europe is concerned, even before the Ukraine shock, it had started emerging out of its fortress mentality. One sign of that was how gradually it had become more alive to its interests on a global scale. The adoption of policies by the European Union (EU) on the Indo-Pacific and on connectivity was a telling indication. However, the enormity of the Ukraine crisis obviously radically transformed the security outlook of individual states, as also of the collective. It fast-forwarded strategic globalism, as Europe itself chose to define the impact and responses in that framework. The challenge nevertheless remains that a continent, which fervently believed in 'change through trade' and was supremely clinical about its interests, now seeks the world's support and understanding. That it has cushioned itself from some of the sharper pains while advocating hard options for those much poorer makes this exercise much more difficult. This was most evident in regard to energy imports from Russia, though it also extends to other aspects of commerce.

Even if the smoke clears somewhat, what would be of great interest to India are Europe's changed relationships across the Atlantic and towards the Urals. Both are likely to encourage a re-evaluation of its Asian engagement. The big imponderables are the future of a German posture so assiduously built over two decades and how much others will seek to take advantage of its ongoing dilemma. Where Asia is concerned, European positions will

necessarily be different from the US because it is no longer defending global supremacy. At the same time, risk awareness has certainly grown in recent years. In many ways, the outcomes will be a compromise between pressing compulsions and medium-term calculations.

It is, however, the premier power of our times that is the bellwether of change. Influential Americans have argued that a less globally dominant US cannot afford the economically generous stance of the past. Their reservations are no longer restricted to just free trade agreements but also extend to the nature of global supply chains. As a result, more innovative endeavours are made to intensify economic engagements abroad that are sensitive to the realities at home. An example is the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), which commenced on the sidelines of the 2022 Quad Summit in Tokyo and has progressed by the time of the 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.

It is not only that the US is looking to realize opportunities differently. The strategy that it fashioned in respect of the Ukraine conflict has also been instructive in highlighting the vulnerabilities of our era. Indeed, the entire game has become one of which party is able to better leverage its hold on the other. A key question is the American ability to address multiple major challenges simultaneously. And of course, that is precisely what distinguishes the dominant power of our times from others. American awareness of strategic competition is greater, and is combined with domestic compulsions to build and protect better. The aggregate of these developments, some long in the making and others more immediate, are truly transformational.

What we are currently experiencing is also being shaped by concerns that go beyond the orthodox belief in Westphalian politics. Admittedly, the Cold War saw systemic competition with the goal of asserting superiority of a set of values over another. But this was balanced by the strong sovereignty sensitivities of a post-colonial order. Along the way, a broad compromise was struck where internal affairs were respected, while making exceptions in a few egregious cases. Even that was heavily tempered by strategic considerations; all departures from the supposed norm were not treated equally.

When it came to economics, transactionalism was much greater and societies were treated like black boxes. At a macro level, economic choices were not personal; it was just business. What was happening inside the box was not supposed to be our concern. But as globalization steadily promoted

greater interpenetration of societies, this could no longer be dismissed with the same degree of complacency. We were letting in players into our lives who may believe, think and act very differently. It was no longer just a question of importing their products; in fact, they were now operating in our territory as well. And while this maybe physical in some respects, a digital age ensures that AI ranks foremost among our concerns.

Such an exposure naturally raised concerns about transparency and trust. It understandably bothers us if the restraints and firewalls that are our norm are not theirs. Not just that, the behavioural shifts in world affairs started to impact the global structure itself. In more sanguine times, we focussed mainly on efficiencies and competitiveness. However, as market shares and interdependence began to get strategically leveraged, the extent of our exposure also emerged as a national security concern. Such volumes did exist earlier; it was just that they were not manipulated in the same manner so prolifically before. There is no question that we have now slipped into a different culture of diplomacy, one with less inhibitions and greater coercion. Among the key developments of the last decade has been the weaponizing of the routine. It could be trade, tourism, connectivity or finance. As a result, everything needs to be hedged against now. Such anxieties have also fed into supply-chain concerns. The age of political agnosticism has effectively come to a close.

Ironically, the turn of events in Afghanistan could be interpreted as going in the opposite direction. For many, the real problem there was how intrusive the foreign presence in that country had become with the goal of nationbuilding particularly coming under criticism. It is a moot question whether the foreign presence in Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks could have limited itself without adverse consequences. But even that is probably entering a false debate. The true challenge was not the ambition of the goals but the understanding of the landscape. For two decades, the US struggled with the paradox that the very country that was fuelling the fighting against it was also the one critical for its logistics. The dilemma was so acute that even the presence of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan could not bring it to head. This should not take away from the dexterity with which those cards were played by the Pakistani military, leaving a generation of American military and political leaders with scrambled identification, friend or foe (IFF) systems!

Today, however, the world contemplates the opposite quandary. It desperately hopes that irrespective of developments within the Afghan

society, there would be no negative external implications. Some countries define that in terms of terrorism and radicalization. Others are more concerned at the possibility of refugee outflow or treatment of women. Whatever happens, the truth is that international relations continue to grapple unsatisfactorily with the problem of reconciling sharply divergent cultures in a more tightly integrated world.

## **THE ARRIVAL OF 'OTHERS'**

Some of the frictional aspects of the current situation have spawned their own discourse on how best to advance interests. In an effort to correct the outcomes of a less strategic era, there has been a debate about the virtues and viability of de-coupling. Like most other concepts, it is sensible to avoid extreme interpretations.

The global economy is today far too interlinked for it to be nationally separated in a comprehensive way. No society can really afford to see that happen, which is why it will not. At the same time, there is open talk of strategic competition that cannot be wished away either. Competitors clearly are not going to trust each other beyond a point. Any two-way link, be it trade, resources, connectivity or pipelines, will normally be better leveraged by the harder state or the one smart enough to have anticipated it. The very openness that drives creativity and progress also becomes a vulnerability. The likely repercussions of such attitudes will be to encourage autonomy and safeguarding in selected areas and, at the same time, to try and develop redundancy and reliability wherever necessary in other domains. This also leads to a renewed focus on export controls and technology sharing. Chips and semiconductors are an obvious example. There will be sociopolitical consequences as well, as different nations will adjust their procedures and practices as per a less trusting ethos. From academia to business, from research to travel, the world will see this impact in the coming decade. On top of it all, the political economy and orthodox security will continue to play out.

Who will gain and who will lose when the external environment is less favourable is an interesting proposition. How power differentials assert themselves is no less significant. We have already seen that some players have misread the strategic culture of others, leading to unintended results. A

world that is more united in some respects but struggling deeper in others will surely be a novel experience.

The response of states is naturally conditioned by changed circumstances and surroundings. It is, therefore, all the more important that we appreciate the structural changes underway. The reality is that the loosening in the architecture created by the limitations of the US and the rise of China has opened up space for others. We may have two major powers, obviously not quite at the same level. But even this does not translate into traditional bipolarity. There are now many more players whose growth is autonomous and whose weight is increasing. To varying degrees, they will exploit gaps, just as they will take advantage of competition. Some of that will be constrained by their biases, affinities and interests. But as a broad pattern, they will be tempted to make the most of the ambivalence of those more distant. The diversity of alliance interests could be a contributory factor.

We must also appreciate that alliances themselves are a product of a set of circumstances. Copying the broad and durable network created by the US is near impossible. No other power has the capacity to even attempt a serious replication. But changing times produce different models and the unceasing process of establishing a global hierarchy will surely find unique expressions. Economic integration and dependency may now become more determining factors in the emergence of a new order. The possibility of alternatives should not be discounted.

A broader spread of power among nations with less structural rigidity is exactly what defines the arrival of 'others' on the world stage. This category may itself be a spectrum, with some having a longer history of power projection and some a more immediate relevance. Again, a few could aspire to be leading powers one day, while some may be simply protecting the leads of the past. Moreover, a globalized world no longer requires all-round development of power to make a nation stand out in competition. If some facets are adequately developed, that in itself provides enough capability to make a difference. It could be military force, as in the past; natural or financial resources; a strategic location; a cutting-edge capability; or an effective platform. A combination of them makes a powerful case for greater influence.

The prominence of such powers is already expressing itself in greater regionalism. Whether in Africa, West Asia, the Gulf or Oceania, differences and disputes are being addressed in a more localized manner. In fact, the

openings provided by the transformation underway are so significant that they can be leveraged even by smaller nations.

Few regions have displayed this more graphically than West Asia. Its stronger regionalization has been expressed in conflicts and tensions that are increasingly driven by resident players, both big and small. While the rest of the world continues to have significant stakes, their ability and inclination to intervene is clearly declining. Leveraging of natural resources has long been a tradition. To this has now been added the innovative applications of technology. Whether it is from Yemen or Gaza, we are witnessing how longstanding problems have acquired highly impactful contemporary forms. Much of this has also fed into regional competition, especially of middle powers.

Numerous players operating with greater agility and less constraints in an interdependent world make a compelling case for pragmatism. In certain senses, shared interests can help override ideological or systemic differences. Whether it is in domains of energy, connectivity or technology, those who have little else in common have come together for their individual gains. But here, too, there is a larger structural logic to what is unfolding in front of us. That the unilateralism of any single power is untenable as a standard operating principle is obvious by now. The 1990s are well behind us and cannot be reinvented even by the most powerful of those emerging.

At the same time, the problems of the world have also become so complicated that no bilateral relationship in itself is adequate to be a regular solution provider. Theoretically, there is good old multilateralism to which everyone always pays lip service. But its frailties and shortcomings are even more openly on display. It is not only anachronistic but functions at the lowest common denominator, that too with deep deference to vested interests. This then necessitates arrangements of convenience to assert themselves.

Such minilateralism is practised in different combinations on various issues. As it grows, a larger culture of plurilateralism has begun to emerge. In itself, this is not entirely new. Earlier, a regional explanation provided a basis for working together. So, we had the EU, ASEAN, SAARC, GCC, etc., where proximity was the foundational basis for shared activities. We also saw nations collaborating on specific issues like maritime security, counterterrorism, export controls, non-proliferation and climate change. It could even be an effort to influence rebalancing and advance multipolarity. And it

went beyond the compulsions of geography. BRICS is one case in point, where four continents were reflected in one membership.

The difference now is that such groupings can become broader in their agenda, while also more purposeful in their working. The Quad, in that sense, is a sign of such changing times. What makes this format more appealing is that it has much lower overhead costs. There are no treaties, obligations, establishments or even disciplines that come with better relationships. It would seem that frugality is also a virtue now in the area of diplomacy.

When it comes to multipolarity, it is essential that we do not judge this complicated world by a simple yardstick. The phenomenon itself expresses a range of credible powers, whose interplay influences the global outcome. But the fact is that nations have acquired such differential capabilities that they perform in an increasingly domain-specific manner. Consider how this appears from the perspective of a nation like India. Political multipolarity has an obvious set of players, among them the P-5 nations of the UNSC, collectives like the EU and ASEAN, and those individual states that are regionally important. Economic multipolarity, however, looks very different because it is a product of some other factors. India's most substantial trade accounts are the hubs of the EU, the US, China, the Gulf and ASEAN. The equation stacks up still more differently in the case of energy. The key partners on this score are Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Russia, UAE and the US. Viewed from the technology perspective, the answers would move much more in the direction of Western economies. When it comes to mobility and skills, the Gulf obviously has to be given its due weight, but it is the West that provides more value addition.

All of this is supplemented by a truly worldwide constituency when it comes to multilateral outcomes and global issues. Voting patterns of nations are often characterized by blocs and India's appeal is accordingly targeted. This complex picture underlines how much more layered foreign policy calculations have become in this day and age. A large nation and a rising power certainly cannot visualize its strategy in linear terms or with limited variables. And the beauty of our differentiated world is that everybody is pursuing their own matrix.

The commentary that accompanied the expansion of BRICS in South Africa in August 2023 merits some observations. Much of it suggested that the US specifically, and the West generally, were the elephants in the room.

The truth, in fact, was very different. The outcomes were an intricate negotiation to find common ground among the powers that were actually there. Each one of them had their own reasons to chart an independent path and there were overlaps between them. The six invited states (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and Argentina) all have strong and established relationships with India, as indeed with other BRICS members. Their own inclinations are very much towards multipolarity.

The occasion also saw a groundswell of pressure on the UNSC reform, which, therefore, led to a significant evolution in the collective BRICS position. That both current and potential members have a shared interest in promoting trade settlements in their national currencies was another point of convergence. The bottom line is that the international system is today headed in more independent and multiple directions. Viewing it exclusively through an anti-Western prism would be misleading.

### **A POST-COVID WORLD**

As challenging as the long view is, nothing really prepared us for the enormity of the Covid pandemic. It was not the human toll that it took, which alone was mind-boggling. The disruption it caused to the routine was just beyond imagination. The reason for this was that the last time something similar took place, the world was not as tightly connected as we are today. The difference between the Spanish Flu and Covid is a statement about the evolution of global society. They influence our expectations of an effective response, as they do of the benefits of international cooperation. But the impact cannot be judged just in terms of problems or solutions; it is even more about mindset.

The implications for international relations are particularly far-reaching. The Covid experience has challenged the globalization model that had entrenched itself in the last three decades. The efficiency obsession has been balanced to a considerable degree by a hedging mentality, and the experience on the vaccine front has heightened awareness in the Global South about its interests.

This pandemic may be the most serious in living memory, but it should be seen as a recurring challenge and not a one-off. It demands cooperation on a scale that could not have been conceived of earlier. No national capacity, however large, proved to be adequate. And merely excess volumes from

even the large capacities are not clearly enough to address global needs. A collective response, by itself, could fall short if it is just an aggregate of the present capabilities. What we will now have to conceptualize is reengineering of the way the world works to respond to such cataclysmic events. The pandemic has certainly triggered debates on issues like supply chains, global governance, social responsibility and even ethics. It equally encourages an objective assessment of the contemporary world, so that we are better prepared for tomorrow.

As nations contemplate the world, there is no question that Covid has moved the needle in the direction of fears. This is reflected in national security acquiring a more expansive definition. In the past, defence, politics and intelligence drove calculations, with extrapolation into domains like resources, energy and technology. With some notable exceptions, their demands were balanced out by the requirements of global exchanges, economic efficiency and by social habits. These trends, in fact, became stronger as the globalization mantra took deeper root.

The pandemic, however, saw capabilities leveraged, commitments dishonoured, supply chains blocked, logistics disrupted and shortages created. When this applied to PPE, medicines and ventilators, we woke up to health security. Those who saw their essential supplies under threat now realized the value of food security. Where economies slowed down due to material disruptions, we now understood the need for manufacturing security. Call it buying nationally, middle-class concerns, dual circulation or selfreliance; its underlying message is not that different. The efficiency of others may have strengthened bottomlines in good times; they are now seen as too unreliable for difficult ones.

The nature of the Covid experience has also brought to fore concerns of transparency. Opacity can no longer be overlooked; it has real implications for the rest of the world. It was bad enough to be confronted with shortages and disruptions, worse that they could become pressure points. There are also worries that the financial distress caused by the pandemic could lead to new vulnerabilities. Consequently, strategic autonomy is now being debated as greater self-sufficiency, stronger partnerships and multiplicity of options, all of which are perceived as integral to risk mitigation. These can have geoeconomic implications in the days ahead.

Behavioural aspects have also played their part. Stresses induced narrower definitions of self-interest and departures from collective

endeavours. Few practised what they preached; some even stopped preaching altogether. Inadvertently, insights emerged on the interplay of culture, interests and values. Pluralistic societies remained more engaged with the world and solidarity was stronger between them. And those who saw the world also as a workplace, rather than just a marketplace, had a deeper interest in remaining connected.

Challenging as they may be, the essential realities of our times cannot be denied. Our globalization is deep and pervasive and will continue to shape activities and strategies. What Covid has brought out are some of the particular risks of its current incarnation. The task before us is to de-risk that, even while pursuing other objectives, including rapid economic recovery.

Every solution, however, also throws up new problems. The digital domain that is enabling so much delivery is raising issues of both privacy and security. That is even more so as AI gathers steam. Critical and emerging technologies are gaining in salience as revolutions in energy, mobility and communication unfold. Ensuring that newer supply chains do not enhance global vulnerabilities is of utmost importance. For India, this is the subject of engagement bilaterally with the US, trilaterally with Japan and Australia, and collectively with the Quad. The Trade and Technology Council initiative is a parallel exercise with the EU.

What is now clear is that the alarm bells set off by the Covid experience have brought into focus a larger challenge of ensuring trusted collaboration. The truth is that market economies and democratic societies offer a degree of reassurance that the international community recognizes as vital to the coming times. In line with this thinking is a growing realization that Free Trade Agreement (FTA) choices should not be divorced from strategic directions. Precisely because much that India has to build lies ahead of it, we have greater stakes in ensuring the requisite partnerships and accessing the necessary resources.

India is, however, in it not just for itself. For the Global South that has barely come to terms with Covid, the Ukraine conflict has added to their trauma. The 3F (food, fuel and fertilizer) insecurity has been aggravated by trade and tourism disruptions. Concerns have been intensified by the perceived insensitivity of the developed towards their predicament. As homilies on open markets are pronounced while shortages mount, many legitimately fear that their experiences of vaccine inequity will be repeated in other domains.

In this situation, India has to summon its rallying powers in addition to its production capacity. Even against some headwinds, we have championed the cause of the economic security of the South. Setting an example in that respect is itself a powerful message. We stood our ground against considerable odds when it came to Covid, refusing to sacrifice the interests of our citizens. Energy security is a different but not dissimilar fight and what we do has a resonance well beyond.

Let us, therefore, take stock of what we confront. As it is, a world order into its eighth decade had run its course and is ripe for change. This is driven both by the national prospects of major powers as well as the cumulative impact of greater rebalancing and multipolarity. To that is added the complexity of a more interdependent, tech-centric and borderless world, where the concepts of power and influence have acquired new meanings. And this mix now experiences a pandemic that exceeds any in living memory; a conflict that impacts the most complacent continent and beyond; a power vacuum in a sensitive region like Afghanistan and both departures and reaffirmations in a volatile one like West Asia. Some major players have heightened awareness of their predicament while others have made sharp assertions of power. This is really a new era of multiple strategic competitions. As a result, there is truly disorder under the heavens, and it will take all the fortitude and staying power of a civilizational polity like Bharat to tackle it effectively.
