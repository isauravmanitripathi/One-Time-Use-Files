## WHY BHARAT MATTERS

### Grasping Our Value, Expressing Our Confidence

The successful landing of Chandrayaan-3 on the moon coincided with the BRICS Summit in South Africa. Predictably, that extraordinary achievement dominated the proceedings. Leaders of the Global South expressed pride that one of them was capable of such a feat. This is but one example of how much India is impacting the world today.

A few weeks later, the G20 Summit in New Delhi unanimously produced a substantive outcome. This diplomatic accomplishment was paralleled by the admission of the AU as a permanent member, that too at India's initiative. Here again, there was a larger resonance of these developments. In the years before, India's Vaccine Maitri effort provided health access for many small countries, otherwise forgotten in the pandemic. Three very different examples in very diverse domains have one message: that India matters to the world more and more.

A new generation of more globally aware Indians naturally debates our weight in world affairs. One way at approaching the issue is to consider why and how India matters to others. The answers are not always that simple, though they could start with the common-sense proposition that India has always mattered in some way. After all, such a large landmass with so many people and that rich a history and culture would naturally have made its impression. By its very existence, India occupies global mind-space and its growing vigour would only expand that appreciation. The questions now are really of the extent to which its revival is shaping the world order and what that portends for the future. This means choices, policies, leadership, delivery and, not least, an awareness of who we are and how we assert our collective persona.

In popular parlance, Hanuman is synonymous with devotion, perseverance and strength. The irony, of course, is that Hanuman himself does not know the full extent of his own powers. As Agastya revealed to Rama, this was the result of his antics in early youth that troubled many sages in the midst of their meditation. Hanuman was, therefore, cursed to be forgetful until divine duties require otherwise. As the epic unfolds and Hanuman takes on increasing responsibilities, his own self-awareness enhances commensurately. At key junctures, he is indeed the saviour of the situation. When Sita was abducted and a search mission was set into motion, Sugriva divided his army and sent them in all four directions under experienced leaders. Vinata, Sushena and Shatabali were tasked with leading the forces to the east, west and north respectively. But it was Hanuman, along with Angada, who was given the responsibility of going south, which was perceived as the most promising prospect. Just as Angada was giving up on the task, Hanuman exhorted him to keep faith and persevere.

As he stepped forward during various stages of the epic, his true potential was displayed for the world to see. When Lakshmana was struck down in battle and could only be revived by the medicinal plant *Vishalyakarani*, Hanuman was sent to the Dronagiri Mountain to gather it. Unable to identify the plant specifically in day time, he picked up the entire mountain and brought it for the more discerning monkey-chieftain Sushena to pick the right herb. As many other occasions testify, Hanuman is determined, innovative, outcome-oriented and selfconfident.

The legend of Hanuman could well be the story of India in the last decade. The more we do, the more we believe we can do. It is this self-discovery that has made India so different in recent years and set it on a course that has major implications for the global order.

#### **A DEMOCRACY THAT DELIVERS**

India can matter by just being there, as a market place, as a contested ground, a resource or a platform. Indeed, as it did during colonial times. This breeds a survival mentality that, at best, can graduate to a transactional one. But India can also matter through the power of its ideas and actions as an engine of the global economy, a hub of innovation or a democracy that delivers. That is the course of destiny, and its ambitious path requires deep determination and strong perseverance. The debates within our society will decide which road is finally taken. As a nation, choices are becoming increasingly stark. The progress of the last decade points to hope and optimism, while the old order highlights our insecurities and underlines the divides.

Indians, of course, must be conscious that the world has a lot riding on our decisions. Those who wish us well will endeavour to cooperate. Others who see our rise less favourably will obstruct, if not do worse. Either way, we must be prepared for those who will participate in our discourse, even intervene in pursuit of their interests. As discussed earlier, it is vital that we do not open ourselves to the external shaping of our prospects. India certainly matters to its own people, and for that very reason, we must recall from history why our future must not be decided by those outside.

The place that India has long occupied in global thinking is manifest in the obsessive search for trade routes to it. They may have initially taken European explorers to the American continent. But when the explorers finally reached India by sea, even more significant consequences unfolded. Using it as an effective base, Europe was able to thereafter dominate the rest of Asia. In fact, even China's fate in the nineteenth century was very much shaped by the outcomes in India.

Not surprisingly, this centrality of India worked the other way around as well. Its independence set in motion a larger decolonization process that became the basis for the contemporary global order. Decades later, India's economic progress contributes to a rebalancing and multipolarity that is still unfolding. These may be some illustrations of an argument on why India matters. Pondering over its past importance certainly helps to gauge its future relevance.

Part of why India counts is obvious. For a start, it represents a sixth of humanity. So, its successes and shortcomings have clear global connotations. But for Partition, India, and not China, would have been the largest society in living memory. The case for India is, however, more than just one of demography. For it is among the few civilizational states that has survived the ravages of history. Such polities are distinguished by a different level of culture and heritage, with accompanying attitudes and mindset as well. They take the long view, especially in regard to global issues. Many of their goals and objectives also build on traditions that are not readily shared by contemporary peers. Simply put, there is not only a scale and history but an exceptionalism about India that makes it matter.

Societies can be relevant as a playing field for others or they can be players by themselves. The colonial era with its ruthless extractive culture presented that sharp choice in the last few centuries. You were either a victim or an assailant; there was no middle ground. However, the progress of

contemporary times has provided the basis for change beyond that binary. It is not merely a platitude to state that this is now an era of greater cooperation. New activities and energies emerged from the freedom of nations to be taken forward by comparative advantage. In due course, their political importance increased in world affairs. In doing so, countries transcended their earlier predicament and became factors of influence. Large ones, in particular, regained their natural weight and salience in the calculations of others. Their choices and actions started to determine not only their own prospects but also those of others. This could be from a set of capabilities, a reservoir of resources, the quality of talent, the importance of location or even national will and leadership.

It is the entirety of this matrix that is shaping the rise of India. As our nation completes 75 years of independence, Indians should examine their prospects against a global context that has been equally transformational. The world undoubtedly offers vastly more opportunities, but that is also embedded with new responsibilities. India matters because these cannot be separated, and it counts on both scores.

While size and population are obvious indices of a nation's potential, neither is a self-fulfilling criterion by itself. Our own past history is proof of that assertion. There are others, too, whose political standing has been below par despite these attributes. And, in contrast, there are much smaller nations that have punched way above their weight. The core of global rebalancing has been the revival of China, India and some others in the Global South that have made their long-standing characteristics count more through national revival. A key factor is the pace and nature of development, including the enhancement of human resource quality.

In this respect, recent happenings are a source of hope for India. There is, after 2014, a holistic commitment to achieving social development goals through dedicated campaigns covering every segment. They include better health and immunization, reducing gender gaps, expanding educational access and coverage, promoting skills to fostering talent and innovation, making it easier to do business and creating greater employment opportunities. The resulting inclusive growth will naturally contribute to strengthening capabilities and expanding the marketplace. But just as notable will be its impact on the global workplace, and this really matters for the world.

A knowledge economy like India putting such a premium on human resources makes it imperative, for itself as much as for the world, to focus on

realizing SDG targets by 2030. It is clear from the national campaigns initiated after 2014 that these 17 SDG defined by the UN are indeed among the government's key objectives. And this has continued despite the Covid challenge. Take the Jan Dhan–Aadhaar–Mobile (JAM) trinity that has empowered millions of vulnerable by providing banking and digital services. In a similar way, the expanding health coverage demonstrates that this need not just be the prerogative of the developed. The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme for girls' education also has such sweeping societal implications, and so does the Jal Jeevan Mission to bring tap water to homes, the Digital India network to bring masses online and the Ujjwala programme to replace burning firewood with cooking gas. These are examples of the ability to address long-standing challenges in a lasting manner. The aggregate impact of these campaigns is improving the socio-economic welfare of a significant proportion of humanity. Why India matters is because its record of progress would determine global success in meeting the SDG Agenda 2030.

Not all readily appreciate that it is India's political choices that have enabled democratic values to achieve a near universal status. Till we took the call, these practices were widely perceived as the prerogative of developed countries only. It, of course, was enabled by the fact that democratic traditions are deeply rooted in Indian history and culture. But this aspect was not asserted even by India in earlier years, and its modern incarnation was depicted for years as an anomaly. So much so that opinions in the West were quite comfortable recommending military rule as a better governance solution for the 'less worthy'. Our own region provided the most telling examples in that regard, with Pakistan touted for years as a preferred partner. In fact, India made a difference not just by building a modern democratic polity under testing economic conditions but by drawing on its own heritage of pluralism to do so. Unlike many other societies, India never put a premium on uniformity. On the contrary, its innate unity, which was expressed through diversity, is the real basis of its culture of confabulation.

In contrast to challenges faced by others in recent years, India's credentials have only become stronger with time. Whether it is in terms of electoral participation or broadening of political representation, the effectiveness of the democratic process is only more apparent. This is no mean achievement, given the alienation caused by globalization and the disaffection fomented by disinformation. In our case, we are seeing an increased vigour of democratic activities and debates, supported by the

validation of power transfers. And we can confidently state that unlike in some other places, at least our election results are not doubted! It can, in fact, truly be said that democracy is not just doing well but better than ever before.

In an argumentative society like India, political debates often take the form of polemics. A globalized existence means that they can even spill beyond our borders. But for those who see first-hand how consistently our people expand their freedoms, it is evident that India's value has grown in the eyes of the world because it is not only a political exercise at home but also a democratic assertion of a resurgent society.

When the virtues of an open society are being rediscovered, it is not enough to be a democracy. We have surely been one for 75 years in a narrow sense and, in truth, very much longer societally. It is even more important to be a democracy that delivers. It is on this score that the last decade has been so critical. A genuine passion for good governance, combined with effective application of technology tools, has started to transform the socio-economic landscape. And the world can only marvel at the scale and intensity of the transformation.

By firmly establishing a digital backbone across the country, 800 million plus Indians received food support and half of them also received money in their bank accounts during the Covid pandemic. Think about the enormity of this effort: it is like supporting the entire European and American populations at the same time. Indeed, each one of the programmes and schemes has been carried out on a magnitude that approximates the population of a major nation. The Jan Dhan initiative is like banking the US and Mexico at one go; the Saubhagya scheme is like electrifying all of Russia; Ujjwala is equivalent to changing the cooking fuel for all of Germany; and the Awas Yojana is like housing all of Japan. Examples could be cited in other areas like clean water, health coverage and farm support. The direct benefit transfers (DBTs) from India's digitalization have also ended a long tradition of leakages. The 2 billion plus vaccinations too are a feat in themselves. Perhaps the biggest lesson is how these initiatives have helped to democratize technology and empower the masses. India matters because it not only symbolizes good governance; its digital public infrastructure has a larger relevance to the world.

Developed nations may gladly recognize such progress in a polity that they have long viewed as an underperformer. It certainly opens up new avenues of collaboration. But developing countries see it as experiences that

are directly applicable to them, especially when they are executed on such a large canvas.

That India has now become a laboratory, a training ground, a driver of innovation and invention as well as a field of demonstration heightens its relevance. The Covid pandemic brought out its contribution as the pharmacy of the world. Its digital skill and start-ups are generating a steady stream of technologies and services. Its impact on business outcomes is as strong as on public delivery. In fact, key global challenges like climate action are likely to be more effectively addressed if India emerges as an exemplar. Its leapfrogging potential will make a real difference when realized. Similarly, the rapid progress of Make in India in different domains can validate how much more can be made with the world and for the world. The scale, scope and competitiveness that we can bring to bear have all the markings of an additional engine of growth. India matters both as an inspiration and as a key factor in decentralized globalization.

#### **SIGNIFICANCE OF ITS TALENT**

The last few years have seen a surge in India's self-confidence. A generation that is surer of itself naturally has higher aspirations. For talent to be translated into capabilities, it is necessary to create the mechanisms, institutions and practices. Large nations, in particular, require deep strengths. If there has been a major shortcoming in India's post-1991 performance, it has been in the inadequacy of that level of capabilities. Contentment with corporate profitability overrode any commitment to create resilient domestic supply chains. That growth was insufficiently reflected in expansion of employment spoke for itself. Reform itself was conceptualized in narrow terms to serve a limited constituency.

As the nation now shifts gears to upgrade the human resources chain as well as step up manufacturing and innovation, a new range of prospects has opened up, from established domains like chemicals and textiles to contemporary ones like electronic hardware, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. The determined effort underway to better realize its potential can make a difference. The manufacturing of Apple products in India may be just one example, but it is surely a powerful statement. India will only matter if it makes a greater contribution to global production and reliable supply chains.

The enormity of India's human potential has long been undervalued, even within the country. Let us look at what is already a reality. There are currently 32 million Indian nationals and persons of Indian origin (PIOs) living and working abroad. The US is home to about 4.5 million, many of whom are important to technology and innovation. Twice that number, approximately 9 million, resides in the Gulf and keeps their economies going. Commonwealth societies like the UK, Canada, South Africa and Australia account for another 5 million plus. It could be larger or smaller nations, nearer or distant ones, historical emigration or recent movements. Indians matter because they are truly global.

The pervasive spread of the Indian community has been a natural accompaniment of globalization. It is obvious to associate it with skills and talents in various geographies. The million plus Indian students who are studying abroad are also going to increase in number. They and their domestic counterparts are being wooed through mobility partnerships offered by the developed economies. So, as the world moves towards higher skills and tougher demographics while India itself improves the quality of its human resources, the demand–supply fit has an increasingly powerful logic. Recent agreements with Portugal, Australia, Austria, Germany, Japan, the UK, Italy and France are harbingers of this change. India matters because with each passing year, it will become a bigger factor in the global workplace.

In such a scenario, the obligation on India to take care of its own has grown steadily. It is not only that their presence abroad is greater but that the expectations of its people are too. We often tend to see that as a reflection of stronger national capabilities, and that is not wrong. But equally, there has to be the political will to deploy resources, especially in high-risk situations. Among the significant shifts in India's diplomatic posture is the inclination to undertake operations abroad for the welfare of its citizens. These often involve use of military assets. The most recent, of course, were Operations Ajay, Kaveri and Ganga that brought back our nationals from Israel, Sudan and Ukraine respectively. Of much greater magnitude was the Vande Bharat Mission, perhaps the largest such in history, through which its citizens abroad came home during Covid. There were many others, ranging from the Yemen conflict and Nepal earthquake to the South Sudan violence and Kabul's capture.

Together, they signify not only a more frequent activity in comparison to India's own past but also when assessed against the proclivity of other states. The generous usage of funds abroad to mitigate distress situations affirms this mindset. India matters because it is not only pulling its own weight abroad more but extending a helping hand to others while doing so.

#### **EXPANDING STRATEGIC HORIZONS**

International relations understandably assign a great importance to geography. The Indian peninsula has a visible centrality to the ocean that is named after it. That this sea space is also a particularly active arena of maritime projection makes it even more significant. There is a continental dimension to India's presence as well. Without its active participation, no trans-Asia connectivity initiative can really take off. After all, it provides the contiguous link between Southeast Asia and the Gulf. Location confers a centrality to India, quite apart from the potential global power that has risen just before it. Management of their overlapping peripheries becomes an onerous responsibility. That many of India's other immediate neighbours also share people-to-people and cultural ties adds to the complexity that policy has to address on a sustained basis. How well India leverages its geography is a considerable part of its relevance to the world. To the extent that it is able to influence the Indian Ocean and participate in the Indo-Pacific, its global stock will rise commensurately. And if its prosperity and progress serve as a lifting tide for the larger subcontinent, then this would be even more consequential.

History may be a mixed blessing for most states, but making the best of it is nevertheless still a policy compulsion. In India's case, Partition not only reduced its stature but also cut it off from proximate regions where it had long enjoyed respect and influence. In recent years, reclaiming its strategic legacy has been a major endeavour. The graduation from Look East into an Act East policy highlighted the seriousness of connectivity and security interests in Southeast Asia. It was also the first step towards defining an extended neighbourhood.

In the last eight years, a parallel effort was made in the Gulf to rebuild other long-standing associations that have been disrupted. After decades of limiting those ties to energy and emigration, India is working at creating full

spectrum relationships. Stronger economic linkages are being buttressed by closer security coordination. The IMEC could be a harbinger of a new era.

A third initiative is currently underway and has its own basis, this time aimed at Central Asia. Here, overcoming the impediment of connectivity is central to dealing with a region with such visible cultural affinity. Of course, with regard to the sea space to its south, the 2015 SAGAR doctrine initiated a reach-out to islands whose future is so closely intertwined with India. Returning to history and recognizing our extended neighbourhoods is another reason why India matters.

Political constraints can not only limit the pursuit of national interest but also shrink strategic horizons. To a considerable extent, that had happened in the case of India. As we strive to go beyond the previous framework, it is only natural that the cultural legacies should start to regain salience. The most obvious of these are in respect of Southeast Asia, where centuries of exchanges produced a rich shared heritage. These are visible even today in significant monuments and living arts. Consequently, a new archaeological find in My Son or a conservation project in Angkor Wat, Ta Prohm and Bagan affirms the understandable desire to build further on the past. Towards the East, the extent of the Indian cultural reach goes all the way to South Korea. It is but natural that the cultural revival of Ayodhya should strike a strong chord in that society.

Turning to the West, the expressions of our common history may be a little different but no less a part of societal mores. An energetic culture of trade picks up on old comfort to build new links very quickly. There is an equally intuitive appreciation of the cultural practices of its partners as well. The construction of a temple in Abu Dhabi is symbolic of its time-honoured relationship with Indian society.

The connection in the north to the Eurasian landmass is similarly significant. The spread of Buddhism through the continent carried its own intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic messages. This legacy endures and the endeavour is really to ensure it flowers again. Dedicated efforts have been made in that direction in the last few years, once Indian policy broadened to appreciate its necessity.

The sensitivity to nurturing India's cultural footprint over the ages is now visible in focussed efforts to promote cooperation in heritage conservation. It is not just the rising metrics of power that count; it is also the accompanying

cultural and intellectual resurrection that is key to global rebalancing. India matters on that account due to its unique contributions.

#### **THE WORLD AS A FAMILY**

If from the recesses of history there have emerged factors that enhance India's relevance, this could be the case for more contemporary periods as well. Here, too, the impediments were only in our own minds, conditioned by the politics of the day. Take the events of the last century. Indian contribution to both World Wars was significant, to a point of deciding the outcome in some theatres. Over a million Indians participated in the first one, serving in Europe, the Mediterranean, West Asia and Africa. The bicycle troops in Somme and the turbaned ones entering through the Jaffa Gate in Jerusalem are among the iconic images of that era. But it is only in recent years that the valour and sacrifice of these soldiers has entered public consciousness. Unburdened by agendas, PM Modi set the record straight and honoured them at memorials like Neuve Chapelle and Haifa. Our public naturally then began to take notice. Initiatives are now underway to create historical trails of the campaigns of our servicemen abroad.

This applies in equal measure to the Second World War, when as many as two-and-a-half million Indians took up arms. In this case, the contribution was notable on both sides, with the Netaji-led Indian National Army firing up the cause of freedom. It also extended to major logistical efforts. Countries like China and Russia were kept supplied through the Himalayan hump and the Persian corridor respectively. When an Indian military contingent marched through the Red Square in Moscow in June 2020, this was a reminder of India's contribution to the eventual victory. The stabilizing role that the Indian armed forces played from East and Southeast Asia to West Asia and Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War is no less notable.

It is this tradition of global service that became the foundation for the country to emerge as a leader in UN Peacekeeping Operations. From that, India has now evolved into an effective first responder in regional crisis situations. India matters because it can make a real difference to global needs.

In recent times, India has heightened its international profile and displayed greater diplomatic energies. Regions and nations that were long

neglected at the leadership level have been intensively engaged. Countries in the Gulf like the UAE got a prime ministerial visit after a gap of three decades and Bahrain the first ever in 2019. Similarly, Central Asian states like Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan waited for two decades and a key partner like Australia even longer, for 28 years! Even neighbours Sri Lanka and Nepal hosted an Indian PM bilaterally after long breaks. These endeavours have been supported by more systemic linkages across multiple domains. On important issues at global gatherings, India's voice has been stronger and effective.

But at the end of the day, much depends on the overall posture adopted by us. When our national security is at risk, it is essential to stake out positions and back our bets. If we were serious that there is no longer tolerance for terrorism, then an Uri or a Balakot had to happen. If our northern borders are threatened by China, then Covid or no Covid, the Indian armed forces will be counter-deployed. Even otherwise, a rising India must continuously push the envelope to expand its space. The pursuit of national interest is respected the world over, even by competitors. Doing what it takes is even more critical when it comes to core interests. This may apply to the safeguarding of its territorial integrity and sovereignty, combating terrorism, pursuing its economic interests and, indeed, in responding to global challenges.

Participation in the Quad is a recent example that has certainly enhanced India's standing in the world. Similarly, its stance on the Ukraine conflict resonates strongly with much of the Global South. We speak for them on energy security, food inflation and trade disruptions. India matters when it displays confidence, independence and determination.

Owing to its very uniqueness, India is not an easily replicable model. But it does offer experiences for others who are facing similar challenges. Indeed, the more it rises, the greater is the value of its achievements. The world recognizes both the singularity and the relevance of India's progress. Put aside those who harbour political prejudices; the rest get it that a civilizational state rising again will display its own personality. It will speak and think for itself, radiating how it is rooted in its own culture. The more assured India is, the more expressive it will be. Only then can it overcome the image of being a poor cousin mired in its colonial history.

In this endeavour, India is uniquely positioned to bridge modernity and tradition. It will be more impactful by embracing its heritage, not by diminishing it. A combination of cultural beliefs and modernizing agenda

helps address many current dilemmas. Its historical characteristics are a source of strength once they are approached with confidence. For example, the appreciation of pluralism is as much a derivative of long-standing social practices as of a constitutional mandate. Similarly, stronger nationalism at home coexists traditionally with enthusiastic internationalism abroad. Rising India wants to engage the world more, not less. India matters when it is more authentically India.

Given its growing political stature and economic abilities, India has to credibly address the expectations that the world has of it. And this has to begin in its immediate neighbourhood. Those who are physically and historically close to it will naturally turn to India, especially during moments of difficulties. These could be natural disasters or man-made situations, political and economic. The challenges arise, however, when expectations of India are selectively articulated. Neighbours would naturally like it to modulate its presence as per their convenience.

From the Indian perspective, it is not always easy to get the balance right. Doing too much looks intrusive; showing reticence can be taken as indifference, if not weakness. Or losing out to a competitive power. The politics of every partner is a significant variable and context often drives calculations.

The optimal Indian strategy is, therefore, to rise above the day-to-day developments and create structural linkages. For this to happen, a combination of non-reciprocal, generous and patient policies have to come together. They must connect societies at a fundamental level, facilitating infrastructure development, socio-economic initiatives and political comfort. Those ingredients of connectivity, commerce and contacts are the core of India's Neighbourhood First approach. It was equally evident in the manner in which India stepped forward to support Sri Lanka during its economic crisis. In the final analysis, regionalism can only be built if key players are prepared to go the extra mile. And India matters because it alone has that ability in the Subcontinent.

As India's profile rises, its policymakers are also discovering that expectations of other nations are not confined to our immediate vicinity. Ever since its independence triggered global decolonization, India has carried the responsibility of speaking for a larger constituency. The Global South watches its positions and performance carefully, drawing conclusions from both. In the early days, these were centred on consolidating independence

and rebuilding the economy. With the passage of time, more issues of greater complexity have come to occupy the agenda.

The Covid pandemic was the most recent of these, highlighting the challenges of accessibility and affordability of vaccines. Climate action has been a more long-standing concern, with the consistent evasion of financial commitments by the developed countries. The non-tariff barriers on trade and the various forms of protectionism using non-trade considerations are an even longer struggle. Obviously, on many of these issues, India has its own interests at play. But, as it demonstrated through the Vaccine Maitri initiative, it was willing to assist others even in the midst of its own challenges. It was this timing that much of the world recognized as a statement of solidarity. Rebuilding the world order after two centuries of colonialism will not be easy. But India matters because a large part of the Global South believes that it is there for them.

In the last decade, a long tradition of South–South cooperation has developed into something deeper. It captures domains where Indian capabilities have a direct relevance for the aspirations of Africa, Latin America and even the rest of Asia. Some of that has taken the form of development projects in energy, digital, manufacturing, education and connectivity. That has been supported by exchanges of experiences and best practices, including training. It is not just the immediate benefits of these endeavours that matter. They help create more options for the Global South, giving them the leverage to deal with the rest of the world on stronger terms.

On assuming the G20 presidency, the effort at ascertaining the views of 125 nations through the Voice of the Global South Summit was also an initiative that spoke volumes of our mindset. Admittedly, India has an emotional connect with these nations. Whether it is the rise of Africa or the sustainable growth of least developed countries (LDCs), the resulting rebalancing is very much to India's strategic advantage.

In that context, especially since 2014, India has taken active steps to empower the Global South. Lines of credit and grant assistance have been vehicles to execute socio-economic projects of varying levels of magnitude. These range from power plants, dams and transmission lines to public buildings, housing projects, rail and road links, agricultural processing and IT centres. While many have been undertaken at a national scale, hundreds of smaller initiatives at the community level have had an equally effective

impact. The creation of assets and facilities has also been supported by extensive training and imparting of best practices.

What differentiates India's endeavours is a conscious policy of responding to the priorities and needs of the partner country involved. Prime Minister Modi's articulation of the Kampala Principles of development partnership in 2018 really set our country apart. Unlike cases where such initiatives have been driven by extractive objectives, India's efforts are aimed more at ensuring self-reliance; and the partners appreciate it. India matters to the Global South because there are few others who have taken such an approach.

India also matters by displaying its own distinctive characteristics. As its capabilities and influence grow, its representatives are often asked in other parts of the world why it would not emulate the behavioural pattern of those who have risen before it. Obviously, such queries emanate from people who are unfamiliar with India's DNA.

It is essential, therefore, that India differentiates itself by highlighting its own national qualities, beliefs and traditions. The most basic of them is its inherent pluralism, one that allows its unity to be expressed in diversity. Flowing from that is its democratic ethos. This is not just a trait to be practised at home but equally one visible in consultations abroad. Adherence to laws and rules is another important point to emphasize with an international audience. As a corollary, we are not a polity given to pursuing coercive approaches or seeking one-sided gains. Indeed, the sum total of India's engagement with the global community over multiple decades, if not more, is of treating the world as a family. Nowhere is that more visible than in periods of stress, such as the tribulations of recent years.

#### **NEW INDIA AND THE GLOBAL AGENDA**

How, then, is India faring on the world stage? The world is not what it was even a few years ago. That process of rebalancing was perhaps inevitable, even though its pace and quality were outcomes of political choices. The contribution that India has made to this rebalancing has not been small. At a symbolic level, it is recognized in the establishment of the G20 as a premier global grouping. This superseded a purely Western combination of G7 that lost its primacy after the 2008 global financial crisis. But the change of power distribution has many facets and expressions. It may be visible in

economic activities, trade and investment figures, technological capabilities and market shares. But it is also evident in the debates of the day, such as on climate change, terrorism, black money and taxation as well as the pandemic.

India has emerged as a more influential voice in these conversations, as it has done on the consequences of the Ukraine conflict. And then there is the question of shouldering responsibilities, including beyond its shores. The record of addressing humanitarian and disaster situations since 2014 has clearly established India's reputation as a first responder in the Indian Ocean and its littorals, and with Türkiye, even beyond. The ambit of India's activities has also increased, towards the Indo-Pacific in the East and to the Gulf and Africa in the West. What India is saying, doing and shaping is a powerful reason why it matters.

This image has been sharpened by the independence of thought and action that India has displayed during the course of its ongoing rise. Maximizing freedom of choice has historically been an Indian approach. At times, it is done by keeping a distance; sometimes, perhaps better by voicing opinions. But, on occasion, it is also served by working with others on specific issues and designated theatres. After all, why should we not take advantage of convergences with other powers to advance our objectives?

Given that India has such a broad range of interests, it can only bridge contradictions through a multi-vector approach. In other words, the nature of the partners will depend on the nature of the problem. Others will try and restrict that freedom, seeking to impose a veto on our choices. We saw that in respect of Quad. India should never succumb to such pressures or hedge for the sake of hedging. The compass of national interest will guide us unerringly if we do not get distracted by ideological reservations or hidden agendas. The cultivation of such flexibility is all the more important because India will come to acquire a more leading position in the coming decades. And bear in mind that this is not happening in isolation. Other powers, especially those of a middle plus capability and a regional dominance, also have similar aspirations. The multiplicity of power centres is an increasingly visible characteristic of our times. India matters because it is central to the emergence of multipolarity, whether in Asia or in the world.

We are also once again in times when the importance of norms and behaviour has assumed greater significance. There are few nations who would not assert their commitment to international law or respect for agreements and regimes to which they are party. But actual observance can

be quite another matter. The example that has captured attention in recent times pertains to the UNCLOS 1982 and its application in the South China Sea. India took a principled approach to this matter by underlining that it supported freedom of navigation and overflight as well as unimpeded commerce, based on principles of international law as reflected in the UNCLOS. It also urged all parties to show utmost respect for the UNCLOS, which establishes the international legal order of the seas and oceans. More importantly, India led by the power of example when it accepted an arbitration verdict on its own maritime boundary dispute with Bangladesh.

Another debate that has also featured in contemporary consciousness relates to the relevance of connectivity to world politics. Here, too, India has been among the earliest to enunciate an objective and fair position. In essence, it declared that connectivity initiatives must be based on recognized international norms, good governance, rule of law, openness, transparency and equality. They must be financially responsible, avoid creating an unsustainable debt burden, balance ecological and environmental protection, transparently assess costs and have a local ownership. Connectivity projects must be pursued in a manner that respects sovereignty and territorial integrity.

While respect for international law is essential to any global order, it is also evident that following its letter but not spirit has had damaging consequences. When systems are gamed and the underlying principles skirted through semantics, clearly the world emerges the worse for it. It is no accident that in the light of recent experiences, there is a global interest in a rules-based order. This is not to be treated as a derogation of law but as going beyond it to promote norms. India matters as an advocate of a rulesbased order.

Once we agree that India does matter, the issue that naturally follows is what it takes to ensure it matters more. That naturally is the focus of its national security strategy and foreign policy. The answer in such cases often begins at home. A nation that sets its house in order clearly counts for more in the global discourse. Some of that pertains to the quality of governance, some to the development of capabilities. Any progress in addressing longstanding vulnerabilities, such as in Jammu & Kashmir, is naturally welcome.

Where its periphery is concerned, stronger structural linkages expand the space for India's activities. A more integrated region offers the benefit to all but not least to the largest player. This can be best realized through

highlighting the attraction of cooperation as well as the costs of alienation. The extended neighbourhoods that represent the next circle also need sustained attention. It is only if they are treated with the priority of immediate neighbours that India can widen its reach. That they are not so proximate also means a more bespoke policy. With the rest of the world, working with all the major powers gives India the most advantage.

But India's own growing footprint is also being driven by demands of engagement from the world. Given its institutional limitations, an efficient method of engagement is to develop more group interfaces. We see that happening as India interacts collectively with ASEAN, the EU, Eurasia, Africa, the Gulf, Pacific Islands, the Caribbean and the Nordic states. These are being increasingly supplemented by plurilateral groupings like the Quad, the I2U2 and BRICS. The bottom line is that India has, at last, broken out of the box that its competitors helped devise. A 360-degree engagement is one more reason why India matters.

For a country that has the history, scale and ambition of India, the games that nations play have to be developed to a higher level. Understanding and exploiting global dynamics is a critical aspect of that exercise. And this is exceptionally challenging because the world is in the midst of a fundamental transition. The reality of an unfolding multipolarity is tempered by the frictions of a more bipolar overlay. On many questions, the narrative can also be shaped by a larger set of players of varying sizes. As a consequence, India has to simultaneously pursue a range of approaches, some of which may appear contradictory on surface.

As a foundational goal, it must strive to promote greater multipolarity and stronger rebalancing. That will happen faster if it has many well-wishers who perceive India's rise as being in their strategic interest. Harnessing the calculations of others is clearly a useful tactic but one to be practised with both prudence and self-confidence. The obverse is no less important, and standing up to intimidation and pressures is part of our maturing. Not least, there has to be a reasonable expectation that a rising power will be tested. The quality of leadership and the ability to perform better on the ground is certainly helping to set India apart.

That India matters and will matter more with the passage of time can be convincingly asserted. Like so many other developments in politics and history, it must never be taken as preordained. There will always be doubters among us who cannot believe that our nation can even dare to think big.

There are vested interests, too, that will masquerade as political correctness and global consensus. We have seen for too long attempts to distance us from our history, traditions and culture. At the end of the day, much will ride on our national unity and collective purpose. Being a serious global player requires ambition and strategy to be backed by initiative, perseverance and energy. Our own people and leadership must embrace their destiny to realize their aspirations. Keeping the faith and getting down to work are good ways to demonstrate it.

Why India matters should also be approached from the perspective of to whom it matters. As a larger factor in international affairs, it clearly features more prominently in the calculations of the rest of the world. At a time of global transition, this is particularly relevant to the larger states that are seeking to shape that process. Obviously, a rising India would also matter more to its competitors. Those who took India's limitations and shortcomings as a given will surely now reassess its progress and prospects. For India's neighbours, the benefits and comfort of being proximate to a generous and non-reciprocal polity are becoming increasingly apparent. For the rest of the Global South, a more powerful India is, if anything, even better.

Overall, the international community today engages India with greater enthusiasm and expectations. That is something that Indians should assess by themselves and from which they must draw conclusions. There will always be the polemicists and critics, but even for them, an India that will not bend to ideological bullying and be deflected from its course is one that they will have to take more seriously.

How does India look to the world today? It is among the few large economies with a robust recovery underway. We are fifth in the world, likely to be third by the end of the decade. It is a polity that, over the last decade, has shown the will to take tough decisions and embark on serious reforms. We are making big strides on human-centric development, digital public goods and green growth. India has stayed strong during the Covid storm and even gone out to help others. When its national security has been challenged, it has stood its ground firmly. Breaking from the past, it is showing zerotolerance for terrorism. It is an India that knows how to take care of its people abroad as well. This New India shapes the global agenda and influences its outcomes. Now, it is perceived as the consensus-builder and voice of reason in a polarized world. At the same time, as the Voice of the Global South Summit demonstrated, others trust us to put forward their case.

This is an India of ideas and initiatives, one that articulates the creativity and innovation of our youth.

A civilizational state is once again regaining its place in the comity of nations. It is doing so in a unique way, encouraging partnerships through its responsibilities, contributions and accomplishments. The world knows that this rise will unfold in consonance with its traditions and ethos. Obviously, its democratic values, pluralistic society and economic outlook will resonate more strongly. But they would be underpinned by deep-rooted beliefs and vast experience from a complex past and present. It is no coincidence that as policymaking is driven by those more grounded, long-standing challenges are addressed effectively. They may range from leaving no one behind to democratizing technology and promoting sustainability. Achievements, be they in space, health, start-ups or sports have instilled a new sense of pride, especially among the younger generation. And that is buttressed by a sharper awareness of heritage and the value we add to global progress.

It may be a society on the move but clearly one with a long view of its own prospects and that of the world. And it stands ready to set contemporary terms of engagement with others. Its outlook is deeply international and built around an age-old conviction of the world as one family. With each passing day, it is becoming clearer that India matters because it is Bharat.
