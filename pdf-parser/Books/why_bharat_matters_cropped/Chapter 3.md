# THE STATE OF THE WORLD

## **Understanding the Landscape**

 $W$  hen PM Modi declared in Samarkand in September 2022 that *this is* not an era of war, the statement resonated across the world. It did so naturally because of its immediate context. But the message also captured the interdependence of our world that has now made conflict very dangerous for everybody. In a sense, it was a caution as well to others who may be contemplating their own options. The fact that such a pronouncement had to be made at all is a reflection on the fragility of the current global order. That it was in transition was already well recognized. But that this process could take the forms we are witnessing today was anticipated by very few.

In 2020, when I wrote *The India Way*, the world already appeared uncertain and unpredictable. Little did we know at that time that we hadn't seen anything yet. In the years that have passed, we have been traumatized by the Covid pandemic, impacted by the Ukraine conflict, grappling with a new level of violence in West Asia, afflicted by frequent climate events and subjected to serious economic stress. They have aggravated both an East-West polarization and a Northâ€“South divide. If there is continuity with my earlier endeavour, it is in the underlying phenomenon of how nation states, still the key concept of international relations, struggle with the problems of globalization. This applies as well to the main takeaway: that the world matters for each one of us as never before. As we consider that, the question confronting every Indian is about what our value, weight and prospects are in the contemporary era. We do so not knowing what even the immediate future holds because the pace of technological, economic and social change has accelerated so much. This is no longer an issue of more variables; we are really moving into uncharted territory. Naturally, at such a moment, it is worth reflecting on how our forebears dealt with the uncertainties of their

era. And in that context, analogies from the past certainly offer some guidance.

The two figures most popularly associated with diplomacy in Indian traditions are unquestionably Hanuman in the Ramayana and Sri Krishna in the Mahabharata. One is perceived as an exemplary embodiment of service, who performs his duties undaunted by any obstacles. The other is regarded more as a strategist and counsellor, a source of wisdom in difficult moments. Each has his criticality in the given context, and Hanuman is at his best when confronted with uncertainty and tough odds. The process of a nation's rise is not unlike the arduous campaigns which embedded both of them so deeply in our consciousness. In fact, it is more than a campaign; it is an endless exercise of expanding prospects. And like Hanuman, it requires true believers and problem solvers who are at it 24x7.

As Lord Rama's emissary to Lanka, Hanuman's cleverness in gaining critical intelligence about an adversary, and even access to the confined queen Sita, were crucial developments. In addition, he used his mistreatment by the *rakshasa*s, who set his tail on fire, to do them immeasurable damage by burning the city. But he also developed key insights about Ravana, his temperament and his advisers. Equally vital is his judgement of Ravana's brother Vibheeshana, who alone stood up for him when he was brought before the court. It is Hanuman's certification of his integrity that encouraged Rama later to welcome Vibheeshana after his defection from Ravana. Typically, people tend to think of diplomacy just as mediation. But in reality, there is so much more to it, including the ability to read competitors, allies and the landscape correctly.

Hanuman is also noted for his persistence, a quality he demonstrated when his fellow monkeys were inclined to give up on their search for Queen Sita. His ability to improvise and solve problems is equally in evidence when he lifts an entire mountain in order to bring back a single life-saving plant. At the end of the war, he is sent on a delicate mission to inform Bharata of the outcome and to assess whether he would really welcome Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya. Each of these attributes are today the prized quality of a successful diplomat.

A different illustration of the complexities inherent in diplomacy is provided by the monkeyprince Angada. He, too, was sent by Rama to Ravana's court in Lanka and cleverly played to his strengths. In his case, that specifically was his leg, which could not be moved once firmly planted on the ground. By making it a challenge, he embarrassed those who tried unsuccessfully to shift his limb. Finally, he humiliated Ravana when the latter tried to reach out for it and dropped his crown that Angada then picked up and threw it back to Lord Rama. As an envoy, he not only resists blandishments proffered by Ravana but improvises to make his points effectively. Denied a seat that is due to him, he is said to have made a chair for himself by elongating his tail and placing himself on par with the demon-king before him. After all, mind games are a key element of diplomacy.

A very different kind of skill was displayed by his mother Tara, the wife of the monkey-king Vali, who was earlier killed by Lord Rama. In the cases of Hanuman and Angada, they were dealing with Ravana, a haughty and irreconcilable adversary. Their mission was to both obtain information and leave psychological scars that would affect the morale of the other side. In the case of Tara, she was confronted with the anger of her current king Sugriva's allies Rama and Lakshmana. Sugriva had failed to deliver on his promise to locate Sita once he ascended the

throne after Vali. It was then that Tara was sent to parley with Lakshmana as he approached Kishkinda, twanging his bowstring to signal his aggressive intentions. Her tactics were astute, and she initially appeased Lakshmana by admitting to Sugriva's fickleness. Having done so, she underlined his devotion to Rama and embroidered reality by highlighting the search for Sita set into motion just then. Even if it meant taking some liberty with details, her effort at defusing a conflict between the brothers and the *vanaras* (monkeys) was successful. If Tara stands out, it is also because she is an exception to the self-absorption that characterizes her kith and kin.

The three cases may be different from each other in objectives and approaches. But what brings them together is a shared understanding of the larger task that confronts them. They have to grasp the enormity of the threat and actively contribute to the search for solutions. There is both a sensitivity required in respect of the larger environment as well as an awareness of their own predicament. Strategic choices have to be advanced but in a tactically astute manner. Honouring of commitments and upholding of principles are essential, but even these need to be optimized. The complex dynamic between the landscape and the game plan is always a perennial issue in diplomacy. Getting them both right is the prerequisite for success.

#### **TOWARDS AN UNCERTAIN, INSECURE FUTURE**

Pondering over the complexities of our own times, we might want to start by reflecting on how a pandemic that first engulfed a distant Chinese city then went on to completely take over our lives for more than two years. Or how and why an ongoing conflict in Europe, an entire continent away, is now affecting our daily life and its costs. And for that matter, the implications that climate events are having on the many processes that we take for granted. Or it could be a different kind of trauma, were any of us to be caught up in an act of terrorism or distantly inspired violence. In some cases, as we saw with students trapped in Ukraine or travellers stranded during Covid, stresses might happen when we are out of our country. But in others, be it Covid, conflict, terrorism or natural disasters, such developments can come right to our doorstep, sometimes even inside our homes. In the age of globalization, there is no escape from the world.

That does not mean that we need to be apprehensive about global developments or defensive in our approach. The flipside of the very interdependence is that the same world is also full of possibilities. If we brought back 7 million plus Indians during Covid through the Vande Bharat Mission, it reminds us that the India of today utilizes the global workplace

extensively. It is equally due to the fact that our talents and skills are now an intrinsic element of global innovation, manufacturing and services. This is also reflective of how many Indians travel for personal or professional purposes. Indeed, these very issues are now central to the priorities of Indian diplomacy. We strive to ensure better access to our talent, stronger protection for our workers, greater opportunities for our students and fairer markets for our businesses.

But the world is not simply about mobility and migration. It is as much about partnerships, compacts and understandings that serve all parties well. In fact, a deeper engagement could lead to accelerating our national development, exploring more markets, procuring resources, improving our quality of life, expanding employment and, not least, shaping crucial global issues that determine the future of our planet.

To accurately assess what the world means to us, we must first of all appreciate that the globalized era in which we live is very much a doubleedged existence. It is hard to separate the vulnerabilities from the dependence or the risks from the benefits. The very mobility that brought Covid to our homes was otherwise such an enormous source of livelihood for so many. The supply chains, which created disruption when they did not function, were a veritable boon when they actually did. Their complexity may be now hard to describe, as indeed their salience to critical aspects of our life. But the Covid era showed us how much we were all dependent on the cross-border flows of goods and services.

Not surprisingly, India was both a contributor and beneficiary in that regard. We sent out shipments of vaccines to almost a hundred nations. But we received ingredients from many of them as well. Nations in the Gulf were critically dependent on Indian exports for their daily consumption. And that continued without interruption because there was a deep understanding of this requirement. This paid off during the medical oxygen crisis in 2021, when the same countries cited it to make shipments to us.

Indeed, if there is one big lesson for the globalized economy from the Covid experience, it is that of more capabilities and options. The 'just-intime' approach with its concentration in a limited geography showed how vulnerable the world could be in a crisis. De-risking the world economy now requires a 'just-in-case' outlook with more diversified production. Where India is concerned, this could mean another chance to board the bus of manufacturing that we had missed a few times before. And this is exactly

what the 'ease-of-doing-business' approach and the offer of 'productionlinked incentives' are intended to ensure.

The last few years have also encouraged us all to become more digitalized. We, in India, have a record that is generating widespread respect for good reasons. The scale of our digital delivery, whether it is in food, finance, health, pension or social benefits, is very much the talk of the world. Here, too, the visible efficiency of that transformation has been accompanied by corresponding risks of data privacy and data security. Where our data resides and who harvests it matter increasingly. The political sociology of such residency or processing is no longer irrelevant.

As a result, trust and transparency have become important guiding factors in digital decision-making. This is even more relevant as we enter a world increasingly driven by artificial intelligence (AI). The potential of critical and emerging technologies (CET) also poses its own set of issues. Whether it is for climate change or strategic concerns, countries have shifted towards greener and cleaner sources of energy and mobility. The resources, technologies and production associated with them have their own concentrations and consequential vulnerabilities. As a result, nations have made CET a priority for both their national capabilities as well as their collaborative endeavours.

Beyond the intricacies of supply chains and the vulnerabilities of data harvesting, there are larger changes underway in international affairs. These emanate from the weaponization of a broad range of services and activities that were regarded till now as essentially benign. In recent times, we saw how trade, connectivity, debt, resources and even tourism became points of political pressure. The Ukraine conflict has dramatically widened the scope and intensity of such leveraging. The scale of financial measures, technology controls, service restrictions and seizure of assets has been truly breathtaking.

At the same time, it is also an undeniable fact that global rules, regimes and practices have been gamed for national advantage for decades. In that scenario, the world of comparative advantage had no chance against 'unrestricted economics'. The complacency of the previous era has ended decisively, and each line of questioning now is producing deeply uncomfortable realizations. Sharpening great power competition is inevitably enhancing stress factors across multiple domains. And they will not cease simply because vested interests and political correctness wish to cover them

up. The challenge for many nations, including India, is whether they can be converted into opportunities.

At one level, today's uncertainties induce greater caution about international exposure, whether we consider it from the perspective of implementing strategy or mitigating vulnerabilities. India happens to have concerns on both scores. But beyond a point, that cannot be fully hedged against, since the very nature of our existence now is very globalized. For each nation, especially the major ones, a set of answers has to be found that optimize risks and benefits.

This has led to a revival of interest in strategic autonomy, now redefined as ensuring national capabilities in core and sensitive areas. This process of adjusting towards a different basis of global interaction has naturally generated its own outlook. In our own domestic discourse, we know this as *atmanirbhar* Bharat, that is, self-reliant India. The digital domain has seen its own variation of similar compulsions. Events in 2020 sharpened awareness in India of an exposure that had been built up over decades. The clean app approach and the embrace of concepts like 'trusted providers' and 'trusted geographies' are a resulting outcome.

It is a paradox in many ways that while we speak of the advancements of technology and promise of science, world politics is actually moving 'back to the future'. Some of this arises from the expectations placed on globalization proving to be over-optimistic. This is not to suggest that the underlying economic interdependence is not well-founded. But widening differences among and within societies and creation of new global equations have meant that counter forces of globalization have been set into motion. Once challenges began to be articulated, the globalization model was not easy to defend precisely because its benefits were so heavily skewed.

Political expressions of globalization have also created their own backlash. When self-appointed custodians of correctness sit in judgement over democratically elected representatives, they cannot expect to be unchallenged, especially when they have such visible stakes in the preferred outcomes. To add to that, some countries are advancing aspects of their own model as an example abroad. Cumulatively, this has led to a situation where political and social identities have resurfaced strongly, creating inherent tensions with the nature of economic flows. Because there are so many moving parts, these predicaments are not easy to resolve.

Consequently, different nations are struggling to find the right balance, though the reasons in each case may be different. Some seek to address regime security, others to protect their technology leads or way of life, and still more who would like to limit exposure and build capabilities for themselves. These new forms of competition are likely to be among the fundamental characteristics of the politics of our era. Our globalized world is likely to be fractured in some respects and even selectively disengaged in areas of particular contention. These are some of the inevitabilities for which India needs to plan intelligently.

### **REFRESHING ANALYSIS AND POLICY**

Such examples may reflect more recent trends, but we cannot forget that oldfashioned national rivalry also continues to be very much at play. Especially after 2008, the world has seen a sharper re-balancing and the steady emergence of multipolarity. The shifting terms of the US engagement with it in the last decade is a key dimension. The ending of a 'forever war' in Afghanistan only heralded different ways of ensuring American security and furthering US interests. But the manner in which it did may have signalled weakness of a kind that was not intended. That, too, is going through a process of correction.

The rise of China is an equally profound happening, one whose global consequences are becoming more apparent. That so much of it is taking place outside established constructs is clearly conceptually challenging for both policymakers and analysts. Far from being a zero-sum game, these developments have also opened up space for other players, some essentially regional and others with greater potential. Clearly, the world perceives India to be in the latter category. As all of this is unfolding, the Ukraine conflict has reminded us of the importance of Russia while underlining the strategic mobilization of Europe. If this matrix already looks complicated, then the volatility is further compounded by the impact on the developing world of a range of economic challenges. Throw in a whole lot of pre-existing and neglected problems. As a result, the world as a whole is staring at a far more uncertain and insecure future.

Such a prospect clearly calls for greater diplomatic energies and political creativity. It is even more necessary now to harmonize the pursuit of national interest with a responsibility for collective good. For a nation like

India, where such a large segment of its population is so vulnerable, it means, first of all, to mitigate the impact of key negative trends. In doing so, we not only stand up for our own welfare but speak up on behalf of the Global South as well. Indeed, a domestic outlook that so strongly advocates inclusive growth has a natural inclination to display a similar approach abroad. At the same time, we also have an obvious interest along with the rest of the Global South in cooling down overheated global politics. This is obviously not going to happen overnight, yet, we must persevere.

Beyond the immediate compulsions, there are also the structural challenges of the current world order that confront us. Most of those emanate from the outcomes of the Second World War and the fashioning of international architecture in 1945. But they are also underpinned by a few centuries of Western domination, whose intellectual and cultural facets still remain prominent. The oldest trick in the diplomatic book is to freeze the moment to your advantage. This is reflected in cherry-picking events and outcomes and portraying them as the 'normal' or in creating mechanisms and concepts that are presented as immutable. That, in fact, is what some countries have done so successfully for the last eight decades. Pursuing reform in the multilateral domain and ensuring that global decision-making reflects democratic reality is, therefore, a quest of no small importance.

Allowing the past to influence thinking is, however, not a predicament that can solely be attributed to others. Sometimes, it is an assumption that we maintain ourselves because a particular experience continues to resonate. Thus, even six decades later, the 1962 war with China stirs suspicion of that country in the public mind. Similarly, our hesitations concerning the West derive from the memories of the 1947, 1965 and 1971 conflicts. This applies even on the positive side of the ledger. The 1991 economic reforms, for example, were impactful enough that the need to build on it was not given priority till recently. Such complacency contributed, till a decade ago, to impassivity towards strengthening manufacturing and developing technologies as well as improving our social indices.

At this stage of its rise, India must have the courage to revisit its past and draw the right lessons from abroad as much as from home. Sometimes, this is misinterpreted as political distancing when it is, in fact, an objective audit. It is not only dangerous to remain a prisoner of our experiences but, even more, to romanticize them. We now have the ability to shape the landscape more significantly and must use that more often. It is already expressed in new

concepts like the Indo-Pacific, mechanisms like the Quad or the I2U2 and initiatives like the ISA. The China challenge can only be countered by reversing past neglect of the border infrastructure and maintaining deployments and, indeed, by utilizing the possibilities that global dynamics can offer. On the economic front, we have to be judicious in picking the FTAs and frameworks that truly serve our interests. The need to refresh both analysis and policy will only increase in a turbulent world.

## **CONTINUITY AND CHANGE**

For any polity, national security has an undeniable primacy. Indians are much more conscious of this than most since it has been challenged so often in the last 75 years. In fact, when we evaluate the merits of leadership, it is largely perceived as a mix of addressing crises and ensuring delivery. A lot of our foreign policy is devoted to preparing for, obviating, mitigating and reacting to security threats. Clearly, a time has come that we must decisively address longstanding vulnerabilities that a competitive world regularly exploits. It may have been a political surprise in August 2019 that the Article 370 issue was firmly settled. But the fact is that mainstreaming Jammu & Kashmir was long overdue, and only vested interests were standing in the way.

We need to equally apply ourselves to the hard task of securing our borders effectively, including through promotion of Vibrant Villages Programme. At the same time, as the world penetrates into our daily existence more prominently, we must develop awareness and responses to the problems posed by the 'normal'. These are dangers emanating from the routine, be it digital, financial, ideological or even mobility-related. Just as international economics is grappling with the challenges of new practices, national security, too, must address more contemporary dangers.

A foreign policy that impinges so many aspects of our life understandably has deeper personal implications on our safety, welfare, prospects and opportunities. It has transactional and collaborative connotations, especially in the economic and technology domains. There are, of course, threads of continuity that run parallel to the compulsions of change. As always, foreign policy is a constant exercise of building power and exercising influence, whether for national or collective purpose. It can be a competition of ideas, values or culture that combine to set forth a vision of our future. Each of these facets, old and new, co-exist with others perhaps much more

dynamically in an era of interdependence and interpenetration. International relations are played out in more domains and with greater integration than before. But precisely because it impacts us so profoundly, each one of us today has an obligation to take interest in the games that nations play.

While we overcome constraints, hurdles, habits and black swans, it is particularly necessary for the young generation to appreciate how the world looks at India now. Indeed, many of the very problems of the last few years have earned us credit for coming through in the manner in which we did. The combination of changes in India's political standing, economic weight, technological capabilities, cultural influence and the successes of the diaspora is moving the nation into a higher orbit. Admittedly, there is much more work to be done. But nevertheless, we see a growing recognition in the world that India is at last getting its act together. Some observers have actually said that PM Modi has succeeded in shaking up India in a manner that could not have been foreseen.

Equally, there is a realization that the big issues of our times cannot be solved without India's contribution or participation. This is a moment when India can reset the terms of its engagement with the world. It is also a juncture at which we should be prepared to take up greater responsibilities. The G20 presidency offered an important opportunity to demonstrate that to the world. By tabling new ideas, shaping the agenda, ensuring a consensus, fashioning action plans and promoting G20 enlargement, India certainly made the most of it.

For those who are starting off in life, I can only say that they have every reason to be more confident. India today has determination, vision as well as the perseverance to enhance its global standing. Those more experienced and part of our journey for the last 75 years will appreciate the transformation underway and value the outcomes that it has generated. But all of them would certainly share the conviction that today, even as the world enters a new era of turbulence, we matter more. And with the right leadership, we can definitely weather the storms and make the most of our opportunities. The confidence with which we will accomplish all this is one of the defining characteristics of Bharat.
