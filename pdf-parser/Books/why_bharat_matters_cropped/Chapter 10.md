# Chapter 10. THE ROADS NOT TAKEN

## Recalling Leaders, Revisiting History

 $\bullet$  t is not often that we reflect on what we inherit. But even when we do, there is an inclination to think of the choices made as the only ones possible. Obviously, that cannot always be the case. It is, therefore, useful to regularly revisit the past, especially with regard to strategic assessments. Much of what was long assumed to be the tenets of Indian foreign policy is actually the predilection of the first PM, Jawaharlal Nehru. And this was so because he comprehensively dominated the scene for two decades. But the truth is also that in the early period after Independence, there were vigorous debates even in this domain. A lot of this was driven by his peers, including those who did not share Nehru's ideological bent of mind.

Three relationships, those with Pakistan, China and the US, featured strongly in the argumentation. Overall, Nehru's critics felt that he harboured a sense of false internationalism that came at the cost of national interest. On Pakistan and also on Israel, they believed he was driven by an appeasement that was an important facet of a domestic political strategy. On China, he was perceived by them as displaying misplaced and impractical idealism that ignored the primary logic of statecraft. And where the US was concerned, his views appeared to be an extrapolation of a left-wing antipathy that was so popular in certain circles of the UK. Because these relationships are today the focus of change, it is important for the public to be more familiar with the critical viewpoints. After all, some of the roads not taken then are now being traversed.

Looking back, it is also interesting to note that diverging perspectives were not limited to a narrow group. On the contrary, they ranged from his own deputy Sardar Patel, who passed away early after Independence, to other cabinet colleagues like Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee and Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who both quit to found their own political parties. In Parliament,

criticism of foreign policy was often voiced by Opposition leaders like J.B. Kripalani, Ram Manohar Lohia, Deendayal Upadhyaya and Minoo Masani. But there were differences within Nehru's government as well, most notably on China, as ties with that country worsened. Current generations would perhaps be surprised at the salience of foreign-policy issues in driving domestic politics, both within the ruling Congress party as well as in the founding of alternatives.

One reason to go back in history is precisely because differing political viewpoints gained ground to the point of one of them (the BJP) eventually coming to power. Another is that the very issues of debate then are still the focus of challenges and opportunities now. Whether we could have created different outcomes is, therefore, not an entirely academic issue. But as Nehruvian beliefs used to be projected as a norm and others as deviations, these contestations are surely worth recognizing.

The conviction that Third World-centred solidarity would be a force strong enough to overcome any contradiction between newly emerging governments would be quixotic at best of times. But when actually practiced by a serving PM vis-à-vis an immediate neighbour, it became downright dangerous. This led to downplaying signals and actions in the 1950s that had implications for our security and well-being. We expended political capital espousing the cause of a neighbour who finally turned on us. And, at times, we even deluded ourselves that we had influence over their thinking!

To evaluate such policies, it is worthwhile to reflect on the basis for this supposed solidarity. At its heart was the conviction that there were sentiments and forces stronger than nationalism and powerful enough to overcome cultural identities. Those who hold such views tend to believe that others do so as well, especially if they belong to a similar school of thinking. It was this display of false internationalism that worried Nehru's peer group and led them to voice their concerns. The critique came with considerable variation in intensity, arguments and even the issues. Because they did not necessarily prevail at that point of time does not make their viewpoint irrelevant, especially if subsequent events demonstrated validity.

The standing of those asserting competing points of view is also material. Many of them were truly stalwarts of the independence struggle and some distinguished themselves in the Constitution-making process as well. It is also worth noting that Patel and Mookerjee directly shaped the map of India as we know it today. Obviously, we have to appreciate the compulsions of

that period to also grasp the factors driving decisions. But, somewhere in all that, there are learnings from the voices of dissent as we try to find new solutions to old problems. Whether it is the standing of the leaders concerned, the intensity of their differences or the importance of the issues, there are good reasons for us to look back at their urgings with fresh eyes.

If there is a symbol of loyalty and sacrifice in India's folklore, it is the elderly eagle-king Jatayu. He was very old and virtually blind when Sita was abducted by Ravana. Yet, as the demon-king crossed his path, Jatayu gave his all to prevent evil from happening. He attacked Ravana with his talons, broke his bow with his beak and brought down his chariot. But in the combat, he was bested by the abductor, who chopped off his wings and eventually left him to bleed and die. But before he did, Rama and Lakshmana found him and learnt who was responsible for the kidnapping of Sita. On his demise, the last rites were performed by Rama, who was truly moved by the sacrifice of Jatayu.

Thereafter, it was his elder brother Sampati who made the difference. The monkey contingent under Prince Angada was beginning to despair about finding Sita. As they spoke about Jatayu's fate, Sampati who overheard them came to their assistance. He used his extraordinary eyesight to locate Sita, although she was imprisoned far away in Ravana's garden in Lanka. It was this 'over-the-horizon' visibility that then allowed Lord Rama and the monkeys to now make their plans.

In India's case, too, those with experience and wisdom had insights to offer. Some of our leaders of that era contributed to national security by challenging decisions, even at great personal cost. Their loyalty was no less than that of Jatayu. And their insights, as we now appreciate all the more, as valuable as that of Sampati. We owe it to them and to ourselves to revisit their counsel.

#### **PATEL AND NEW INDIA**

In recent years, Patel has featured more prominently in our national debates and discussions on security. Part of the reason is the change in our political circumstances that allows him to be brought back from the shadows. But equally, it is a reflection of our times when hard challenges and multiple uncertainties have highlighted the importance of leadership. More than any other figure of contemporary India, Patel symbolizes strategic clarity and decisive action in the midst of difficulties. Not just that, he is also closely

associated with nation-building and systemic reform. For all these reasons, he emerges as a natural inspiration for New India.

Seventy-five years ago, both the world and India were experiencing a different kind of turbulence, one no less in its seriousness. The Second World War had just ended, comprehensively overturning the global order. New centres of dominance emerged with very different interests and outlook. Forces set into motion, many predating the conflict, eventually ended colonial rule in many parts of the globe. At home, of course, the endurance and determination of our independence struggle finally prevailed. But it did so at the cost of the partition of our country, with all its accompanying consequences.

This was the context when Patel ascended the leadership stage and took on the immediate challenges of nation-building. He was already recognized as among our pre-eminent leaders, admired for his political vision as much as for his organizational skills. On the assumption of power, he took on the most daunting responsibilities of governance, characteristically setting his personal interests aside. It is generally agreed that he was the preferred leader of his own organization, but he eventually yielded to the choice of Mahatma Gandhi in that regard. And it is this period of his national leadership that holds the most relevant lessons for us today.

In the popular mind, Patel is seen as responsible for the accession of Jammu & Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh. In reality, his contribution was even greater. In fact, these examples, challenging as they were, took place on a firm foundation that he had laid through a set of high-stakes and fast-paced negotiations with many other Princely States. To those unfamiliar, it is necessary to underline that even some southern Princely States were reluctant initially to sign the Instrument of Accession. Certain British officials from the Political Department deliberately encouraged many rulers to hold out, suggesting that a 'third force' created through aggregation could be viable. As a result, each state had to be individually and painstakingly engaged. In that process, some actually went to the very brink. Those geographically more contiguous to West Pakistan were tempted by Jinnah's ostensibly generous offers. It finally took the enormous pressure exerted by Patel to ensure their accession. There were smaller principalities that were being difficult too, often instigated from behind by larger ones. It was only in early August 1947 that the tide turned decisively.

Two negotiations that continued after Independence under Patel's direct oversight were those pertaining to Junagarh and Hyderabad. Interestingly, both of them threw up the possibility of going to the UN, but Patel prevented it decisively. Because these events happened within India, we tend to think of them as politics rather than diplomacy. But as V.P. Menon has so ably chronicled, the exercise involved the toughest negotiations we can imagine. And whether it is in their objectives, strategy or tactics, they remain worthy of deep study even today.

That there were differences between Nehru and Patel on referring the invasion of Jammu & Kashmir to the UN is a well-known fact. Indeed, that was only one aspect of a larger divergence on handling the issue. This eventually saw Nehru divest Patel of the responsibility in the cabinet for Jammu & Kashmir and hand it over instead to Gopalaswami Ayyangar. On China, I have already examined how the two leaders reacted differently to its professed posture vis-à-vis India. But for all this, the discipline that the government, Parliament and politics impose ensured that much of the disagreement remained restricted to their internal correspondence. In response to Nehru's sensitivity to criticism on foreign policy, Patel gave him an assurance that he would limit the forum of expression to cabinet meetings.

Rather than focussing on what has been already highlighted, it may be worthwhile to explore some other views that are less known publicly. One relates to the difficult navigation of the Cold War era by Indian foreign policy. Significantly, on such issues, Patel was often the voice of moderation and caution. He felt that there was little to gain by excessively antagonizing Western powers, especially when India's direct interests were not at stake. The issue was not so much about specific choices and positions but more a discomfort with a larger attitude. From time to time, they found echo in positions that were also taken at that time by C. Rajagopalachari. As India– China ties worsened at the end of the 1950s, foreign policy views were asserted more independently by serving members of the Nehru cabinet. The point to appreciate is not whether they were right or wrong in their immediate stance. It is more that they came out of a stronger sense of national interest rather than an ephemeral sentiment of global solidarity.

There are two live issues right now in respect of Indian diplomacy on which Patel offered his views in his lifetime. One pertains to the US, and he obviously had a much less suspicious view than Nehru. In 1948, a year before the latter paid his first visit to that country, Patel opined that the US

actually held the key to the international situation. He felt that without American cooperation, it would be difficult for India to industrialize significantly. Keeping that in mind, he made out a more India-centric case for collaboration than Nehru, whose overall assessment was more coloured by the need to create a non-aligned front. Two years later, in one of his last public appearances, Patel pointedly remarked that many people believed that India should not take American help because it would lose prestige and be perceived as joining a bloc. He felt that India was quite capable of realizing its own interest and position. In that sense, the origins of an 'India First' outlook go back many decades, though it clearly took a nationalist ideology to bring it back to life now.

The other issue pertains to the hesitation in recognizing Israel and establishing full diplomatic relations. Patel was clearly uncomfortable with the vote-bank pressures on Nehru and believed that this should not be given a determining say over the making of national policy. As with some other foreign policy issues, his thinking did not prevail, and it was not until PM Modi's 2017 visit to Israel that this issue was finally put to rest.

The quest for a more perfect union is one that is pursued by all diverse societies and federal polities. Indeed, if there is one area in which Patel left an indelible imprint, it is in national integration. As a civilization that values unity in diversity, it is vital that we nurture the bonds that bind us together. Our journey in the last 75 years has not been without its obstacles. If we have successfully surmounted them, it is, in large part, due to a national determination that emanates from the Sardar's legacy.

But there are issues left over from his era in which neglect had been rationalized to great measure over the years. Catering to vested interests or ignoring ground realities cannot serve us well. World politics is extremely competitive and others are constantly looking for weaknesses within. Our deep underlying pluralism that harmonizes so much diversity is our civilizational strength, not just a contemporary creation. We know this instinctively, though some parts of the world may struggle to understand.

An India that is true to its roots will always be strong and resilient. Our thinking is best driven by self-belief and national awareness. Sardar Patel presciently cautioned us in 1948 against submitting our positions to the interests and judgement of others. That holds true as much now as it did then.

#### **THE MOOKERJEE ALTERNATIVE**

If Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel pursued his beliefs and commitments while functioning within the government, that was not the case with his contemporary Dr Syama Prasad Mookerjee. There are many facets to his contributions that are worthy of discussion. After all, he was a notable educationist, an influential political personality, a leader in providing humanitarian relief and an ardent espouser of our culture and traditions. Above all, he was a fierce nationalist and one quintessentially Indian, who approached his nation and its prospects through that perspective.

Our focus is naturally on those activities that were critical to the direction of immediate post-Independence India. Many became the basis for a cohesive and alternative way of thinking in this country. These expressions of nationalism drove a debate over many decades about the nature of our politics and governance. They also influenced our view about development and progress, including on how best to stand on our own feet. And of course, they shaped our approach to engaging the neighbourhood particularly and the world at large. At one level, each of them may look like a different domain. But the truth is that they represented a holistic worldview, and, in real life, each was inseparable from the other.

The question that is most deeply associated with Mookerjee is that of the accession of Jammu & Kashmir and the ensuing debate about that process and its implications. His position is, of course, summed up by the famous slogan: '*Ek Desh mein do Vidhan, do pradhan, do nishan, nahi chalenge* [There cannot be two Constitutions, two PMs and two flags in one nation].' In Parliament and outside, Mookerjee brought up concerns of balkanization and the weakening of the Indian polity as a result. He flagged the implications of contesting sovereignty, claiming competitive status and restricting the display of national symbols. These issues no longer require any further elucidation after so many years and so many experiences. We all know how damaging it has been economically, developmentally, socially and in terms of national security when Jammu & Kashmir were not fully integrated into the mainstream. When that was decisively rectified on 5 August 2019, obviously our national integration emerged that much stronger. But from a foreign-policy perspective, what is worth examining is how this issue was taken advantage of by external powers vis-à-vis India.

Such an assessment is not a retrospective view. Even in 1953, Mookerjee conveyed to PM Nehru that his handling of the Kashmir problem had neither enhanced our international prestige nor won us wide international support

and sympathy. On the contrary, he felt that it had created 'complications' at home as well as abroad*.* He, therefore, urged Nehru to re-examine policy dispassionately rather than be carried away by 'false internationalism'. This reference to complications abroad must be noted because that is precisely what came to preoccupy Indian diplomacy for the period thereafter. As Mookerjee was to state in Parliament, India went to the Security Council on the question of aggression, not on the question of accession. How this was distorted by interested powers is a parallel that he draws in a manner similar to Patel's caution.

With the passage of time, the diplomatic consequences of the early misjudgements on Jammu & Kashmir have receded from public memory. It is possible that the gen-next is even unaware of the pressures that our country faced. Yet, this must be recalled in order to fully appreciate the significance of what was done in respect of Article 370 in 2019. The global manipulation of the Jammu & Kashmir situation is worth examining in some detail. This would explain what Mookerjee meant when he spoke of complications.

In December 1947, India referred the matter to the UN under Article 35 of the UN Charter as a threat to international peace and security created by Pakistan's support to the invaders. There is a separate debate on whether this was the best pathway that India could have chosen at that time. But there is no need to get into that discussion. What we should bear in mind is that the British-appointed Governor General had, two months earlier, accepted the Instrument of Accession in regard to Jammu & Kashmir under the relevant legal provisions. But this did not stop major world powers from taking advantage of an opening that the situation provided.

As the recent colonial power, the UK was in the lead. It was also the one with the strongest post-Partition agenda and, therefore, the most mischievous. The UK influenced the passing of a Security Council resolution calling on both India and Pakistan to refrain from any acts that would aggravate the situation. In effect, the aggressor and the victim were put on par. Declassified records indicate that there was a clear strategy in the Commonwealth Relations Office to bring in Pakistani troops and balance out India.

The next step was a move through Belgium, as the president of the Security Council, to establish a three-nation commission. In that process, India's main request that Pakistan refrain from assisting the invaders was conveniently dropped. The further sleight of hand happened when the title of the resolution itself was changed from 'Jammu & Kashmir Question' to the

'India–Pakistan Question'. Canada took over from Belgium and carried the Western agenda forward by pressing for a Pakistani military presence in place of the invaders if they withdrew. Matters reached a stage where India threatened to leave the Commonwealth in protest against such bias.

As the stakes rose higher, the US and other Western allies also got drawn deeper into the game. Intense pressures were exerted over the next few years, including the threat to withhold assistance to India. The turning point, of course, was a 1957 UK–US draft resolution that ended up being vetoed by the USSR.

India's defeat in the 1962 conflict with China saw a renewal of such efforts in the next decade. The Harriman-Sandys Mission of 1963 that sought to arbitrate on Jammu & Kashmir was the most serious of these endeavours. If they failed, it was less due to intent and more because of global circumstances and India's resistance. The illegal 1963 China–Pakistan agreement on Shaksgam Valley made it awkward for Western nations to make common cause with Pakistan beyond a point. But by 1965, Western partiality for Pakistan reasserted itself through their efforts on suppressing its responsibility for initiating the conflict.

Although this issue moved purely to the bilateral format as a result of the Shimla Agreement of 1972, attempts to interfere in Jammu & Kashmir nevertheless continued. This happened publicly during the Clinton Administration. Even the reaction of Western powers to our 1998 nuclear tests tried to link it to this issue. While the Bush Administration moderated this somewhat, there were nevertheless conversations behind closed doors. Barack Obama also brought up Kashmir during his presidential campaign and there was a debate about the US Ambassador Richard Holbrooke's remit that bears recalling.

Such diplomatic endeavours aside, what has hurt our interests more are the actual violations of sovereignty and territorial integrity by China. It began in 1963 and kept increasing through connectivity projects that later developed into the so-called CPEC. Each of these efforts has been countered and will continue to be so. But keeping all this in mind, we must appreciate that in mainstreaming Jammu & Kashmir, we have not just strengthened national integrity but also enhanced national security. And this is absolutely vital as India raises its profile on the global stage. Certainly, our Western partners today are much more understanding. But let that not cloud the fact

that the real change has been in our own position that draws inspiration from Dr S.P. Mookerjee.

A question closely related to the mishandling of the Jammu & Kashmir issue is that of India's misreading of Pakistan, its intent and its policies. This, too, is a long-standing issue that has cast its shadow for many decades on our well-being and security. And here, too, there has been a decisive shift in Indian thinking.

In Mookerjee's case, the matter acquired particular salience because it was the cause for his resignation from the Union Cabinet. He shared his assessment candidly with Parliament in 1950, diagnosing the prevalent attitude to Pakistan in words that still resonate with all of us. In essence, Mookerjee viewed Nehru's approach as weak, halting and inconsistent. In his reading, India's inaction or goodness has been interpreted by Pakistan as weakness. In fact, according to him, it has made the latter more and more intransigent, made India suffer all that much more and even lowered it in the estimation of its own people. On every important occasion, Mookerjee asserted that India has remained defensive and failed to expose or counteract the designs of Pakistan aimed at it. This could well be the natural thoughts of the average Indian citizen in the aftermath of the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai!

When it came to displaying strategic clarity about Pakistan, there is no question that Patel and Mookerjee stand out. Apart from the accession of Jammu & Kashmir and treatment of minorities, this was most notably on display where Mookerjee was concerned in regard to his own province of Bengal. Once the concept of partitioning India was accepted by the Congress, the key question became the future of Bengal, Punjab and Assam. Each of them had to be individually partitioned if the entire state was not to go to Pakistan on the basis of a tenuous majority. It was to this cause that Mookerjee then devoted his energies, ensuring that the metropolis of Calcutta (now Kolkata) and as much of Bengal as possible stayed with India. Obviously, this had direct implications for the fate of Assam and even of the Northeast. To that end, he convened meetings of a cross-section of society and led a public agitation that compelled a positive outcome.

Today, we cannot even contemplate the consequences of a different result, leave alone what it could have meant for the conduct of our foreign

policy. Mookerjee did in the east what Patel did in the north and the west. In that sense, the India of today is very much their creation.

While there is a larger point that Mookerjee was making with reference to our approach to Pakistan, his specific analysis of the Nehru–Liaquat Pact of 1950 is also relevant even today. Let us not forget that this understanding was the precipitating factor for his resignation. He underlined that the pact tried to ignore the basic implications of an intolerant State; that the declared positions of the Pakistani government undermined any sense of minority security; and that an ultra-communal administration was giving life to these policies.

There is much that Mookerjee had warned about the treatment of minorities that came true in the decades that passed. He perceptively noted that there was a general impression that India and Pakistan have failed to protect their minorities. The fact, however, is the exact opposite. Mookerjee's view was that in some sections of the foreign press, a hostile propaganda has also been carried on. He believed that this was a libel on India and the truth, he felt, had to be made known to everyone who desire to know it. Apparently, some things have not changed in some quarters!

Mookerjee's remarks on the India–Pakistan equation are of greatest longterm relevance. He predicted much of what has gone wrong, not just in the pact but on the broader ties with Pakistan. In that process, he identified the key conceptual shortcomings very clearly, especially that India and Pakistan are made to appear equally guilty, while Pakistan was in fact the aggressor. Moreover, he pointed out that when Pakistan violated agreements, there was no remedy open to India. He, therefore, felt that there must be sanctions built into any understanding, an approach that would have served India well had it been seriously followed. Seven decades after these insights on Pakistan, it is essential that we reflect on the judgement that Mookerjee bequeathed to us.

This is all the more so as the equivalence between India and Pakistan that was so troubling even in the initial years after Independence morphed into a persistent hyphenation. For decades, India and Pakistan were uttered in the same breath and their differences made to look like a natural agenda left over from Partition. There were even periods when a military regime in our neighbouring country was held out as an example of development! The 1971 outcome obviously changed much of this, but not as decisively as India would have hoped. Pakistan kept trying to create an artificial balance and was actively supported in that endeavour by both China and Western nations.

This even went to the extent of assisting and facilitating its nuclear and missile programmes. And worse still, Pakistan increasingly resorted to cross-border terrorism to bring India to the table.

If truth be told, our own policies were not sufficiently robust to firmly discourage this approach either. Instead of confronting the cross-border nature of terrorism emanating from Pakistan, we even appeared to be open at Havana and Sharm El-Sheikh to a narrative that suggested that both India and Pakistan were victims of terrorism. This was exactly the false equivalence that Mookerjee cautioned us about in his time.

So, what is the answer? We have seen that unfold over the last decade in a variety of ways. To begin with, this means a clear position on the unacceptability of cross-border terrorism. It is obviously not in our national interest that we normalize terrorism by carrying on with the rest of the relationship as usual. That message has been sent loud and clear. Where egregious actions of cross-border terrorism are concerned, the operations at Uri and Balakot are as much a shift in our thinking as in our action.

It is also important to mobilize the international community through advocacy and awareness creation. Only then can we be successful in delegitimizing terrorism. As a result of our diligent efforts, there is widespread understanding today that this is not a threat to India alone. That the UNSC's Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) held a meeting at a 26/11 site in Mumbai was a statement of no small significance. It is also our endeavour to get global platforms and conferences, whether we speak of the G20, meetings like 'No Money for Terror' or bilateral and plurilateral mechanisms, to keep the spotlight strongly on such threats. The listing process created by the UNSC 1267 Sanctions Committee has its own importance. And there are no prizes for guessing which country features prominently in it!

Another domain where Mookerjee's views remain an inspiration is that of cultural diplomacy. As the president of the Maha Bodhi Society of India, Mookerjee was also the driving force in forging links with Buddhist nations, especially neighbours. He played a personal role in the return of holy relics from the UK and their display in Southeast Asia, including Myanmar. Today, those initiatives are being further developed through recent activities like the

Dharma-Dhamma conferences, restoration of the Ananda Temple in Bagan, solarification of Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka and digitization of manuscripts in Mongolia's Gandan monastery. Indeed, the importance we attach to our Buddhist heritage was only underlined by the visit of G20 Development Ministers to Sarnath. Obviously, Mookerjee's cultural interests were much broader and must be assessed in terms of its relevance to the anti-colonial struggle. Our endeavours at deepening cultural rebalancing would surely resonate with his views about the salience of that domain.

### **DR AMBEDKAR AND 'INDIA FIRST'**

Among the founding fathers of modern India, Dr B.R. Ambedkar is widely recognized as the architect of India's Constitution and the strongest voice for social justice and inclusiveness. He was different from many of his contemporaries in being exposed to American society through his educational experiences. As the first Minister of Law and Justice, he served in the cabinet of independent India for little more than four years. When he resigned in September 1951, the main reasons were his dissatisfaction on a range of issues pertaining to social reform. But interestingly, Ambedkar also shared with Parliament his 'actual anxiety and even worry' about the directions of foreign policy. In his view, few countries wished us ill at the time when we attained independence. However, within four years, he felt that we had alienated much of the world and that this was visible in the lack of support for India at the UN.

Ambedkar, on that occasion, quoted two realists in a manner that is relevant even today. One was Bismarck, with the observation that politics is not a game of realizing the ideal; it is the game of the possible. The other was George Bernard Shaw, to the effect that while good ideals are good, one must not forget that it is often dangerous to be too good! It would seem that even by 1951, important Indian leaders were already alarmed by the impracticality of our diplomatic outlook.

Among Ambedkar's specific grievances in this regard, one pertained to the handling of the US, which he articulated in 1951 in the 'Election Manifesto of the Scheduled Castes Federation' that had a section devoted to problems of foreign policy. Like Patel, who had passed away a year before, Ambedkar too was concerned about Nehru's outlook towards China. But, perhaps due to intervening events, he was now connecting it to India–US ties.

In essence, Ambedkar asked why India was fighting China's battle for permanent membership of the UNSC. In his view, this championing by India had created antagonism with the US and jeopardized the prospect of getting financial and technical resources from that country.

In what we would unquestionably recognize today as a declaration of 'India First', Dr Ambedkar sharply emphasizes that India's first duty should be to herself. In his view, instead of trying to make China a member of the UNSC, India should get itself recognized instead. His characterization of the Nehruvian approach was of it being quixotic, if not suicidal. And his remedy was that India should focus on building its own strength instead of championing the interests of other Asian states. On another occasion, he expressed the same sentiments in his assertion that the keynote of our foreign policy appeared to be to solve the problems of others rather than of ourselves.

Like many of his generation, Ambedkar was obviously deeply conversant with international affairs and visibly invested in its formulation. His plea was clearly not one of turning India's back on the world but instead of making choices that would be primarily driven by our country's gains. In that sense, his endeavour was to get the balance between our national interest and international posture. And like many contemporaries, he appeared to believe that Nehru was leaning far too much in the direction of the latter at the expense of the former.

Ambedkar, too, shared the sense that India was being naïve in its unquestioning acceptance of the principles of Panchsheel. His own view was that they had no place in politics; nor did he believe that China, in its heart of hearts, differed on this matter. In a revealing parliamentary discussion in August 1954 where he laid out his viewpoint, Ambedkar also made a strong case for an interest-based diplomacy. He questioned what he termed Nehru's advocacy of 'Asia for Asiatics', suggesting that greater weight should be given to political values. It is surely not without reason that seven decades later, this debate is still very much in vogue.

#### **MASANI'S PERSPECTIVE**

There are many examples of what we may consider to be current issues actually being debated in our history. Those I have cited above give some flavour of what our past holds, if only political correctness does not stand in

the way of objective exploration. Among the long-held tenets of Indian foreign policy is that of non-alignment. Even though it has a particular global context, this has sought to be made into an immutable concept. That India's capabilities now allow it to move beyond defensive options is often lost on those who treat policy debates as theological ones. But precisely because it is invoked so often, a critical viewpoint is also worth recognizing.

Few questioned the predicaments that the practice of non-alignment could create for India more graphically than M.R. Masani in 1959. And he did so, understandably, as the threat from China loomed large. Masani essentially asked whether our approach had brought us to a point where we were unable to repel effectively an attack on our own territory. Related to that, he suggested that by keeping a distance from the West, we were not even able to equip our forces adequately. But more fundamentally, he was concerned that India's capacity to recognize a dangerous neighbour had somehow got impaired. Its domestic reflection was discouraging our own people from even displaying patriotism. In effect, Masani was bringing out that nonalignment, while working in good times, was less productive in tough ones. Keeping a distance from others also meant that they too kept their own when they wished. Masani believed that non-alignment was not inconsistent with the capacity to recognize a dangerous neighbour and take measures accordingly. Significantly, much of what he said tallied with Nehru's hesitation to engage Western powers even as China advanced into India in November 1962.

As with the other examples, this debate, too, is worth revisiting because of endeavours to put India under pressure. When others extol our independence and strategic autonomy, it is not always meant for India's good. They seek instead to influence our thinking in a manner that constrains our options. In that quest, it is natural that they would use our own past against us. And how can we blame them, when such tactics succeeded as recently as 2007 when it came to the Quad? Strengthening a sense of independence or even autonomy does not necessarily mean staying at the centre or not making commitments. There is an inherent flexibility in that exercise, which somehow got lost when policy became dogmatic. Even today, tactical nimbleness and strategic creativity have a value that cannot be overstated.

At the end of the day, strategic clarity means both a sound understanding of the international environment as well a clear-eyed view of it from our

national perspective. There have been shortcomings on both scores in our early periods after Independence and we paid a high price for it.

From the road taken, we must learn that national security can never take second place, least of all to the quest for prestige. In the final analysis, hard power will always score over soft power. Ideally, the two should be in lockstep, so that capabilities and influence grow side by side. But the desire for acceptance, particularly by competitors, should never become a significant driver of diplomacy. This realization from past experiences now drives India's attitude towards world politics in general and our regional concerns in particular.
