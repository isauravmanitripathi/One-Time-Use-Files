# RE-IMAGINING SECURITY

## **Adjusting Habits to Contemporary Times**

orrosion is now the new competition. In a world of constraints and risks, nations now penetrate and influence of each other. So, if the threats are different, our defences must be too. And that starts with greater awareness of our times. There was an era when we thought of security essentially as policing, law and order, intelligence and investigation. We would stretch it understandably to counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism and border defences. As an extreme case, our thoughts perhaps extended to military conflict. Today, however, you might want to think that through again. Life is not what it used to be; neither are its challenges.

It is not that these entrenched problems have become less; it is quite the contrary. It is that even as we remain focussed on the abnormal, the 'normal' has taken very concerning forms. Every day, all around us, activities and interactions are happening that put our polity and society at risk. Unless we wake up to how much globalization can impact our security, a day may come when we will find ourselves compromised beyond redemption. More powerful nations are struggling with their own versions of this predicament.

Our world has changed profoundly and so, too, must our sense of security. This means looking at the variables of global politics and appreciate what it really means to be in an interdependent and interpenetrative world. The 'knowledge economy' that we are now getting accustomed to can generate new metrics of power. The strongest today is increasingly defined as the smartest. And as the epics would confirm, this is not altogether unprecedented.

Knowledge is power and, in critical situations, often more than that. In a competitive world, this puts a premium on intelligence, assessments and understanding. In a battlefield situation, insights and information can be a veritable trump card. And indeed, this is exactly what we see unfolding in the Ramayana.

The battle between Lakshmana and Indrajit, Ravana's son, is considered in many ways to be the turning point before the final denouement. Its setting is preceded by a 'psy-ops', where Indrajit created a virtual Sita and killed her in the presence of the monkey army. He then sought to use the resulting confusion to complete an *asuric* sacrifice that would make him invincible. It is here that knowledge makes a difference. His uncle Vibheeshana understood exactly what he was doing and counselled Rama accordingly. Lakshmana was sent to Nikumbhila to prevent the completion of the sacrifice. After battling for three days and nights, he killed Indrajit by using the *Indrastra*.

There is also a preceding encounter with another son of Ravana, the giant Atikaya, where inside information makes a difference. Struggling to hold his end up in the duel, Lakshmana was advised by Vayu that only the *Brahmashakti* can kill this demon, which it did, much to his relief. Indeed, Rama himself was the beneficiary of his charioteer Matali's advice to use the *Brahmastra* against Ravana at the crucial moment of their battle. Clearly, informationized warfare provides not just an edge but can be a complete game-changer.

If there is an underestimated character in Ramayana, it is Ravana's younger brother Vibheeshana. Perhaps his disassociation from the parent clan, even for virtuous reasons, left a taint in the public mind. But the fact remains that at the turning points of this saga, he made a crucial contribution. This was something that Lord Rama understood and anticipated when he welcomed him into his ranks despite the reservations of his advisers. He sensed Vibheeshana's ambition to replace Ravana and, significantly, crowned him as the king of Lanka before the battle began. Apparently, regime change has a long history!

On his part, Vibheeshana provided invaluable information through a network built by his allies Anal, Sampati, Pramati and Panas. It was to him that Rama continuously turned for tactical intelligence during the course of the war. And when Rama and Lakshmana were disabled by Indrajit using the *Nagapash*, it was Vibheeshana who gained time for their recovery. Adopting from the ranks of adversaries is always a tricky situation. There are inbuilt doubts and suspicions to that process. But as Lord Rama demonstrated, it really pays off when this is not just sound judgment in the beginning but also the courage to stick to that call through trying times.

A related aspect is the power of the narrative. If assiduously built up, it becomes the basis for dominance, where even the will to resist can be weakened. Ravana is generally regarded as invincible until he was defeated by Rama. The reality, however, was a little different, and it is to Ravana's credit that he was able to create such an effective reputation. That he defeated virtually all his contemporaries was crucial in this projection. So, too, was the fact that his son Meghanada was able to vanquish the king of gods (Indra), thereby earning the sobriquet Indrajit. But it was also true that, on occasion, Ravana was bested in combat and forced to accept that outcome. Among those who defeated him was Vali, when Ravana sought to capture him in the midst of his meditations. There was also an encounter with King Kartavirya Arjuna of Mahishmati that went rather badly. They both happened to be immersing themselves in the Ganga at the same time, and Arjuna's activities interrupted Ravana in the midst of his worship. In the ensuing battle, Ravana was captured and taken back as a prisoner to

Mahishmati. It finally took the intervention of his grandfather, Sage Pulastya, to secure his release. In both cases, Ravana not only beat a retreat but came to a compromise with his adversaries.

Sometimes, even great powers realize their limitations and arrive at accommodations. Expending energy on 'forever wars' or trapped in an infructuous conflict is neither prudent nor rewarding. Growing power is always accelerated by smarter calculations and course corrections. But most of all, Ravana's reputation underlines the power of narratives and how they can become a potent weapon in themselves.

#### **UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY CONUNDRUM**

As a start, let us reflect on the changes that are not always sharply perceived, and then understand how much of our challenges really reside below the waterline. Does it really take acts of violence or spilling blood for a happening to be assessed as injurious? A lot of our security threats are gradual and corrosive, not necessarily blunt trauma. If our nation's unity and integrity is weakened and alternative loyalties created, should we remain indifferent? If sympathy, succour and support are given abroad to separatists in the name of democratic freedoms, should we display equanimity? When national development, especially critical infrastructure, is impeded, do we show indifference? When influence operations are undertaken to shape societal thinking, can we really afford to be complacent? If policy choices for an open economy lead to de-industrialization and external dependence, what does it say for our future? Strategic autonomy can only come from strategic security.

Much of the security debate now revolves around exposure, penetration and vulnerabilities. This is the new world where normal activities can so easily be transformed into malevolent intent. Raising such issues is not a case for tightening control, strengthening authority or turning our backs to the world. It is, in fact, a plea to wake up, prepare, augment, and most of all, not let our defences down.

Indian society is continually seized with the challenges of security, perhaps more than many of its contemporaries. Like the rest of the world, it faces conventional and non-conventional threats of a broad range. Law and order issues and even internal security are obviously more complex in a

large, pluralistic and diverse polity. Concerns about terrorism are particularly sharp since India has experienced unrelenting violence from across its borders. Externally, the task of securing unsettled boundaries has always been an exacting one. That current generations have direct memories of multiple conflicts also shapes our thinking.

Each of these aspects naturally requires an upgraded response. But there are significant concerns as well that are embedded in our increasingly connected existence. Because they are intrinsic to the engagement with the world, there is no getting away from these problems. When it comes to security, doing more and doing better is no longer enough. India needs to do things differently and that means thinking differently. Enhancing security today requires re-imagining it.

Those who spend their lives dealing with national security perhaps appreciate more readily how much our very definition of that term has evolved. Change is driven by the impact of globalization on all societies, the penetration of technology into our daily lives and a more competitive global scenario. What, where, when and how threats emanate is as complicated to anticipate as the manner in which we need to respond, protect and counter. We are required to not only deal with a more intricate framework in which threats are assessed but do so with greater variables. Together, they ensure that the normal has become increasingly unpredictable and that the uneventful is but an exception.

At the heart of the security conundrum is the seamlessness created by the fusion of economic interdependence and technological interpenetration. They have facilitated the flow of information, ideas and ideologies in a manner previously inconceivable. There are the human aspects as well, pertaining to the extent of observance of rules and norms. We cannot be oblivious of the paradox that while our existence is more capability-driven, we are more vulnerable at the same time. The very factors that hold so much promise for growth and prosperity are also the source of anxiety in the wrong hands.

Understanding why security issues need to be approached beyond the orthodox construct springs from these particular realizations. India is a polity that not only values its engagement with the world but is actively seeking to expand it. In fact, the drivers of progress at home link us more deeply every day to a range of factors outside. The task before us is, therefore, to arrive at optimal solutions that maximize benefits while minimizing risks. The era when this could be done through physical controls is now well behind us.

Instead, the requirement is to comprehend, anticipate, prepare and out-think whatever problems the nation is likely to encounter. To do that effectively, it is absolutely vital to develop an accurate and updated understanding of what the world is really about. And today, our existence is shaped by a set of trends and happenings whose externality does not in any way mitigate their deep domestic relevance.

Any objective global assessment now has to recognize the prospect of uninhibited competition among nations, especially the major ones. What that essentially means is that they have not only developed many more capabilities and influence but are also more inclined to exercise them. It is expressed through visible linking of sectors that were generally regarded as autonomous. Business, energy and finance are treated as intrinsic to strategy, as are sports, tourism, education and politics. Norms and firewalls have fallen by the wayside in that process, as have assumptions of what is fair or acceptable. Some of this transformation is structural, but it is strengthened by changes that are behavioural. Globalization and technology would reflect the former; nationalism and unilateralism the latter. The world has seen a sharp increase in risk-taking propensities. No country can remain uninvolved or unaffected, and India is no exception. The bottom line is that our external environment is now much more hazardous.

But the home front is no less challenged, since the phenomenon of borderless politics has erased that comfort too. Many of the same forces also contribute to it, but the variables stack up differently. The ability and the inclination to pronounce on, influence and direct developments in other societies are clearly on the rise. Like established globalization, borderless politics is also played to the benefit of a few. But as in that case, it also shares the advantage of being marketed as in the interest of many. Its expressions range across every medium of opinion formulation and image shaping. Through shaping narratives and argumentation, it seeks to both legitimize and de-legitimize. This may be a broader phenomenon, but that should not obfuscate its security implications. After all, it can disenchant or disturb, or on occasion, incite and encourage challenges. Indeed, motivating beliefs are often backed by a flow of accompanying resources to make them more actionable. It is, therefore, a naïve polity that does not monitor external transactions and when required, regulate them.

Significantly, Western nations are as active as non-democratic ones in this respect, whether legislatively, through intelligence or by administrative

action. When India is sometimes targeted on that score, the irony is that such criticism often comes from those with more stringent monitoring practices. Like many other developments, borderless politics, too, spans a broad spectrum. At one end, there is a desire to assist fellow travellers and those with shared benefits and interests. On the other extreme are endeavours that lead to radicalization, violent extremism or even terrorism.

Then there is the securitizing of the routine. We tend to think of dangers and vulnerabilities as arising from unusual situations: a conflict, a clash, a disturbance or preparations for them. But modern life has taken us into a web of technologies, activities and instruments that can be utilized without the user or the target even being aware. Every day, in myriad ways, we are exposed to risks of different kinds. The most obvious example is that of data and the processes that help generate it. How data is harvested and AI is developed is one of the most intense areas of global contestation. It could be digital transactions and the cyber world that have become so much more salient in our daily routine or the critical infrastructure on which a society is so dependent.

In fact, the Covid experience taught us how even domains unconnected with technology can enhance our vulnerability. In a world of supply chains, shortages can emerge at sensitive moments in key areas. This may be the outcome of logistical disruption, but equally of a planned strategy. As a result, global concerns have focussed more on resilient, reliable and redundant supply chains and, in the digital world, on greater trust and transparency.

The real problem, however, is the weaponization of everything. In recent years, the world has recognized how domains like trade, finance, investment and logistics can be leveraged for strategic purposes. Indeed, market shares and sectoral dominance have been created with that very end in mind. Some nations have put forward entire initiatives that advance objectives that remain hidden until it is too late. Others have been starker, like in the application of sanctions as means of pressure.

Once the mindset of weaponization sets in, almost nothing is safe. It can be directing or withholding the flow of tourists, the supply of raw materials and components or exercising the power of a large vendor or customer. When the market economy is subjugated to non-market goals, we then realize how the normal has added to fragility. In truth, the world has long lived in a twilight zone where rules were manipulated for globalization gains. Now that

the chickens are coming home to roost, we are belatedly waking up to the resulting concerns. Ironically, when strategy demands, even espousers of free-market virtues are prepared to give their principles a short shrift. Security assessments, therefore, now require a comprehension of how dependencies are created and exploited. There is also an understandable trend among polities with greater security consciousness to scrutinize investment inflows and business takeovers.

On top of all this is the now increasingly recognized power of big tech companies, whose market capitalization often exceeds the GDP of nations. This is not just about the mammoth size of the relevant enterprises. Nor is it necessary to enter a debate about the politics and ethics of their influence. As realists, we can be neither oblivious to their relevance in our daily life nor impervious to the outcomes that they can help influence. Concerns about privacy and commerce have now mutated into something much larger. We are used to State and non-State actors. But enterprises with their own megainterests are breaking new ground in modern international relations.

The problem that society at large faces is that these enterprises seek to work on their own agenda and norms. Moreover, recent events have underlined that even strong States find it tough to fully gauge, leave alone control, enterprises of this scale. Such entities can even provide capabilities that are normally associated with governments or stake out their own line of geopolitics. Businesses betting against governments and nations is not new in itself. But the manner in which they do so has been facilitated by our way of life. We cannot be blind to these winds of change.

### **WAR BY OTHER MEANS**

It can be justifiably argued that every society's understanding of security matures, whether spatially or otherwise. Distant threats became more real and imminent as mobility improved. Those who mastered such techniques on an impactful scale became dominant; the rest were their victims.

We, in India, of course know it as part of the Panipat syndrome and, thereafter, the colonial experience. History offers many telling examples elsewhere. The modern era, however, has taken this to a completely different level. For, in effect, globalization and technology have, between them, erased distances and, thereby, create unprecedented challenges.

The old way was to contemplate military capabilities or coercive acts that were instrumental in creating outcomes, balances and influence. Even then, human relationships and financial transactions that were more humdrum and repetitive made a crucial difference. Imperialism advanced by combining all of this effectively. But today, the latter two are more potent in the penetration of societies through the course of normal activities and in creating options, leaving it to be decided when and whether they are to be exercised.

The most underestimated concerns are, therefore, what take place as routine in daily life. From the security perspective, globalization should be assessed for the interpenetration and interdependence that it embodies. And that, in turn, underlines that distance is no longer a safeguard. After all, we have all discovered that self-radicalization can happen without leaving home. Globalization has not only brought the world to our doorstep, it has also carried the accompanying opportunities and anxieties with it. The more technology-centric our life becomes, the more serious the challenges will be.

Even as this spectrum of vulnerability widens, our expectation of what constitutes adequate protection is also expanding. National security was traditionally viewed largely in narrow military, policing and legal terms, highlighting the assumption that threats were both far away and well-defined. But neither hold true any longer. Furthermore, experiences of dependence and pressure, such as of technology and finance, as also of food or fuel, have rekindled a global debate on the merits of strategic autonomy. Bringing economic security to the heart of national security has been facilitated by the rise of China, the changed American discourse, impact of Covid, the Ukraine conflict and the Middle East violence. It has given more weight to livelihood concerns as opposed to profitability considerations.

This steady expansion of what impinges on collective comfort levels has added sharper edges to every nation's calculation. Indeed, disruption itself has become the driver for constantly evolving definitions of security. The value that partnerships and cooperative arrangements now offer as reassurance has increased in value.

Changes are not just structural; they can also be behavioural. We must recognize the inflection points of the last two decades in this context. These include the 2008 global financial crisis and changed leadership styles in many power centres. It continues all the way to the Covid pandemic and the Ukraine conflict. All in all, we are seeing heightened competition in global

politics led by major powers. There is less questioning now when nations use every instrument of influence at their command to advance their interests.

In the past, such tools were visualized as a spectrum, with application of force as one extreme and the power of example as the other. There were practical options that emerged in between, and even their use was tempered by shared interests and common restraint. Perhaps these have not always worked. Whether it was the selective use of force or the application of sanctions, those who had an edge have often chosen to use it. But as a whole, the belief in globalization tended to be a discouragement to adventurism. However, as stakes rose and contradictions sharpened, major powers have displayed the mentality of 'war by other means'. What characterizes our times is a willingness to be far more muscular and unabashed in using the toolbox of influence and capability. That it also contains more tools only encourages the practice further. In fact, we are seeing that approach develop to a point of exploiting many aspects of our globalized life and its activities.

Trade was always political, but is much more so today. Market shares are being openly leveraged for political messaging, whether by buyers or sellers. Monopolies, whether of goods or technology, are being even more ruthlessly exploited. Finance is equally potent, be it the power of currencies or the desperation of debt. Connectivity has acquired a growing connotation of linkage and dependency, assisted by lack of transparency and market viability. Technology, in fact, takes it to a new level because it can be harnessed even more intrusively. As for data, this offers a unique insight into the very mindset of societies. Even the flow of tourism, when it is directed, becomes a card in the influence game. All of these are 'normal' facets of interdependence, often entered into without adequate thought or due diligence.

But competitive politics is not just an exercise in leveraging or coercion; it is equally one of inducements. As a result, projects, activities and interactions all represent avenues to promote and exercise influence. We see that across a broad swath ranging from education and business to media and entertainment. That interpenetration is now so natural and extensive makes these possibilities that much easier.

Encouraging acquiescence or engineering change is as old as politics. The modern nation-state provides the analytical construct for this to be played out as international relations. In its most extreme form, these endeavours are aimed at asserting control by subjugating others. Reality,

however, rarely reaches that level. It is more often expressed as acquiring and sharpening instruments of influence. In a way, it is work continuously in progress. The more dominant nations, by definition, are more active in offense while the vast majority are focussed mainly on defence. Creating a global order is one outcome of this exercise since it establishes mechanisms that regulate behaviour and legitimize demands. Depending on the domain, standards can have great utility by making the capabilities of a few the aspirations of many.

In the evolution of societies, progress in the security world and that in everyday life have always been connected to each other. Advances in one are naturally transposed on the other, whether we speak of materials, communication, platforms or activities. What has often begun in laboratories or businesses has ended up in armouries. Equally, commercializing security inventions or discoveries has been successful over the ages. However, as the world has become more globalized, the lines separating the two are becoming fainter. Some of this reflects the more integrated nature of technology; others derive from a deliberate civil–military fusion. In some nations, in a situation where less is taken at face value, we must be aware that economic activities cannot only enhance security capabilities but can even be driven by them. Where business ends and security begins is no longer easy to distinguish.

Behaviour, too, can be shaped by setting norms and establishing etiquette. That is why rule-making and rule-observance have become so central to debates in international politics today. But the rules of the game are often inadequate to either advance interests or establish an effective defence. It becomes even more complicated when the rules are non-existent, disputed or simply disregarded. Therefore, serious polities naturally concentrate on building capabilities rather than assuming intent. India, too, must recognize clearly that the former can be insurance on the latter. The basis for assured security lies in deeper strengths, a realization that has separated the bigger powers from the rest.

This is particularly pertinent to India because our industrial and manufacturing capacities have not kept pace with the overall growth. Even as we endeavour to introduce corrections, the logic for advocating rules and norms remains generally strong. In the foreseeable future, we are more likely to be injured than to gain from their absence. Smaller nations that do not have our resilience will have no choice but to bend before a few power centres.

Even between major powers, rules could prevent the instability that is in no one's interest. At the same time, there is a developing awareness that in domains like the digital one, rule-making can be used to freeze the leads of established players. Increasing capabilities, therefore, needs to be accompanied by bolder policymaking and building narratives.

Shaping opinions and conditioning thinking are integral aspects of political contestation. If the domain of information has assumed a higher profile now, it does not imply only recognition of its salience but also the availability of new tools. The anachronism of propaganda may have now yielded place to an industry driven by technology and data, but like many other practices in vogue, we should not forget that this too has its history.

Controlling the narrative is always a fight and technology has made it far more complex. Those responsible for law, order and security have to struggle with it every day. It can distort, motivate, alarm, confuse and mislead, sometimes all at the same time. But do not forget the impact of the routine: what we read, see and hear all the time. Think about it: these are also processes of acceptance or rejection at work. The forces that drive them often extend beyond nation-states and traditional definitions of power and influence. On occasion, they could root strongly for the status quo and be sensitive to departures from it. The vehement opposition from select quarters to the change in respect of Article 370 is a case to point. But they may equally make the case for radicalism, or perhaps even extremism in a more acceptable form. We see their hand at work as well when cross-border terrorism is depicted as just a more vigorous form of post-Partition differences.

In fact, the very image of nations is often moulded with an agenda in mind. Data protectionism is an argument used to trivialize digital delivery and justify data monetization. In the same vein, the concept of 'big emitters' seeks to evade historical responsibility. Either way, entrenched elites will monitor and resist the kind of rebalancing that gives emerging societies the confidence to define their own interests.

As with standards in the material field, rising powers typically face narrative challenges from the established views of early movers. In the world of ideas, they seek to define political correctness and make that universal. Often, external interests are strongly aligned with local elite with whom there is a mutual understanding. Our own experience in recent years has revealed how good governance can be distorted as excessive state

control or how anarchy and worse are justified as exercise of democratic rights. A polity that is oblivious to such practices is a society in danger.

The globalized era encouraged the promotion of an integrated broad truth, magnified by well-crafted echo chambers. The unfolding of multipolarity has, however, brought back the natural diversity of our planet. In the ensuing competition, there is always the possibility of both misunderstanding and misrepresentation. Since so much in security derives from perception, we cannot be impervious to the shaping of our image. If we expect an easy passage up the global hierarchy of power, we will be deluding ourselves. How to define norms, where to shine the spotlight, which parts of reality are picked, these are all par for the course. So, too, are the adjectives used in reporting, the free pass from fact-checking and the selectivity of judgement. But knowing full well the bias and interests, it is still a contest that we have to enter with zest and vigour. Creating and propagating our own narratives is, therefore, of great importance. Sections of the world have their views, but we should not be intimidated from having a view on those views. Swimming upstream is the karma of all rising powers.

### **THE ROAD AHEAD**

Building adequate state capacities to deal with a more complex security matrix is a common challenge for larger nations. The very tools that allow us to render more effective services can also help to secure our people better. As with more orthodox external threats, conducting security policy in an informationized environment is the task for which we need to prepare fully. It will have its own challenges and debates, but the direction that we need to move in is difficult to dispute.

The world may have changed in many ways, but an incessant challenge that India grapples with is that of terrorism. That the dangers it poses to the international community are realized is a matter of satisfaction. But to the extent that compromises are made for political gains or regional strategy, it is a reminder of the task that remains. As a primary victim, we cannot expect that others will fight for our cause if we do not do so ourselves. Mobilizing world opinion must be accompanied by a robust defence of our own interests. In the realm of ideas, it is also important that the trap of normalizing terrorism must continue to be resisted vigorously. We must ensure a brand differentiation between two neighbours who each produce

their own brand of IT graduates: one on information technology, and the other on international terrorism.

Security has many dimensions, and promoting socio-economic development is one whose worth is increasingly appreciated. As its impact is felt more deeply, challenges diminish accordingly. India is now seriously focussed on achieving its SDG targets. Precisely because the benefits are so self-evident, there are also ongoing attempts to obstruct development and delay progress. The resistance to road-building in Left Wing Extremism (LWE)-affected areas is one obvious example. But if national prospects are undermined or border area infrastructure paralysed, then it is a worry of an even greater magnitude. As the record shows, this can come in many forms and appearances, some openly negative while others take the cover of public good. While noting the centrality of these endeavours to our prospects, it is imperative that we give due priority to ensuring uninterrupted progress.

The digital domain has a special resonance when it comes to development, especially after the Covid experience. Passport issual was an early field of change, but we can now see that governance itself has undergone a transformation. Given the enormous Indian digital market, it is natural that there is a competition in harvesting the data generated. Smart networks and services in different areas are also a subject of contests. Sensitivity to protecting digital services and data is obviously not unique to India. Like many others, we, too, are evaluating the vulnerabilities enhanced by new technologies. India's endeavour is to find the optimal landing ground that addresses its multiple concerns. These include data protection for citizens, making it easier to do business, ensuring the public interest of efficient governance and safeguarding national security.

A similar sensitivity to telecommunications was a much-awaited step. It will encourage a broader effort to make our security outlook more contemporary. Health security was another important revelation from the Covid experience. Today, we may be exporters of many products and, indeed, a key producer of vaccines. But none of this should obscure the danger of a large society like India depending on others for basic needs. The attitude of states at a time of extreme stress offers lessons that we ignore at our peril. But if we get it right, it can facilitate the building of capacities that trigger their own virtuous cycle.

An active debate is underway on the nature of India's economic engagement with the world. No one seriously doubts the reality of

globalization or questions the need to interact with other economies. The key issue is the terms negotiated by India. Foreign-trade liberalization should not be practised at the cost of fair competition in our own markets. And unfortunately, that is exactly what we have seen in the past. The subsidizing of production and denial of market access in other parts of the world have made it very difficult to compete. If critical production is no longer viable, then it is not a matter of trade policy but a concern of national security. Let us be clear: India can only be consequential abroad if it has adequate capacities at home. It is not our fate to be just a market for goods or a generator of data for others. A rising India will only really advance when it is an *atmanirbhar* Bharat.

India's emergence on the world stage has been an exceptionally eventful journey. And external challenges have been as formidable as the internal consolidation process. The traumatic Partition left consequences, some of which are being addressed only now. And through all this, those opposed to the re-emergence of India have done their best to make that process difficult. Terrorism, radicalism and separatism have been used on multiple occasions. We have been through difficult years but came through stronger due to the sacrifices of our people. The takeaway is the need to deter our diversity being projected as fault lines. Strengthening national sentiment, by itself, may not discourage such continuing endeavours. That we are an open society also means that there are more opportunities for mischief. Eternal vigilance, in our case, is not just the price of liberty but of national unity as well.

India's rise in the global order is not merely an ascendance on the ladder of power. It is simultaneously a transformation of a civilizational society into a modern nation-state. Securing borders and improving governance are no longer enough; they are just the foundation on which many other capabilities need to be developed. As is often the case in India, different eras will coexist, even in the domain of security. In the coming period, our concerns will gradually become more global. But we must not lack the boldness to seek some of the solutions there as well. Just as we prepare for contingencies at home, we must develop habits of cooperation abroad.

If the world carried the burden of pre-existing conditions before it was hit by the pandemic, India was no exception. The conventional narrative in that regard tends to focus on issues of finance and trade, with some social and political problems added for good measure. But a truly self-critical assessment of the last quarter century would raise deeper questions about our

very understanding of reform and globalization. It is often said that in India, we make the changes we must rather than the changes we should. In other words, we react to the crisis of the moment and slip back into a default position of complacency once that appears addressed. And the truth is that this is pretty much what has happened to us since the early 1990s.

Debates on reform have focussed largely on different aspects of the economy, industry and commerce, which is perhaps natural if we recall that the triggering crisis was one of balance of payments. But the undeniable reality is that large swathes of economic, social and human activity were left untouched. Whether it was agriculture or labour, education or administration, the power of vested interests kept the impulses of further reform well at bay. Our human development indices then naturally did not improve as much as they could have, and requirements of urbanization remained as ineffectively addressed as the demands of rural growth. Not just that, the absence of progress across the social front began to tell increasingly even on the economic one.

This domestic scenario was mirrored by an external strategy that has hardly enhanced India's competitiveness. In the pursuit of globalization, we have been driven by short-term calculations and tactical gains. India imported to consume, trade and profit rather than to absorb, innovate and produce. The contrast with East Asia could not be starker. The overleveraging of low-cost options from outside obviously eroded domestic manufacturing. Quite unconsciously, we began to perceive in the efficiencies of others a solution for our own limitations. And with that, the cause of reform remained at a level that was comfortable for the order of the day. If self-assessments remained positive, it was because they were based on benchmarking ourselves against our own past rather than vis-à-vis competitors. By the second decade of this century, these realities have caught up with us. It has led to a growing realization that globalization without a strategy is like driving without a destination. And the true yardstick for reform can only be its impact on comprehensive national power.

Policymakers across the world dealing with the impact of the pandemic are now focussed on economic and social recovery. Nations have made decisions in line with their particular circumstances, many conscious that the real challenges still lie ahead. Addressing both lives and livelihood has been an overarching concern for all.

Expectedly, this is India's primary preoccupation too at this time. The pathway to recovery, however, also has steps of resilience that reflect the pandemic experience. These could be in terms of the more direct concerns, as in the health and pharmaceutical sectors. Or they could be broader, covering domestic manufacturing, distribution and consumption. Rapidly creating a pandemic response infrastructure and meeting huge socioeconomic needs during a crisis have created a new level of expectations, perhaps more than we realize. If the Indian public has shown commendable fortitude and discipline in the face of adversity, it is in no small measure due to leadership and motivation. However, it is essential to think through strategies that would hasten to put the scars of the pandemic behind us.

In a sense, a foundation for that has been laid by a set of initiatives since 2014. National campaigns addressed a wide range of challenges that were traditionally excluded from the debate on reform. They range from financial inclusion to digital delivery, both on a mass scale; from power and water for all to affordable housing; education and toilets for girls to sanitation and cleanliness; urban planning and rural incomes to accelerating infrastructure building; digitization and formalization to skills development; as well as promoting start-ups, entrepreneurship and innovation. The message was of improving human development indices, leapfrogging using digital tools, empowering the aspirational, and expanding opportunities and benefits. No less important was the fact that transformation was brought about through mobilizing and motivating society at large. By doing so, it finally put behind us the colonial mindset that the people and the government are two different entities. This commitment to societal transformation is clearly appreciated by the public at large.

We must have no illusions about the fact that the road ahead will be a long and arduous one. Looking at the horizon, there are lessons from experiences of others that India needs to imbibe, whether in terms of human resources, social infrastructure or economic capabilities. Basic amenities of power, water and housing can no longer be treated as a luxury. Nor can education, healthcare, skills and employment remain optional for some. In particular, a greater focus on technology and manufacturing is central to India's prospects. Digitization could well hold the key to the credible emergence of social welfare in a nation with stretched resources. Let us understand that in a world where trade wars and technology battles are likely to be more commonplace, de-industrialization is truly akin to unilateral

disarmament. Therefore, making it easier to do business is not just an economic objective, it has enormous social and even strategic implications.

In the final analysis, it is central to the rapid strengthening of India's comprehensive national power. As far as reform is concerned, India would truly arrive when we internalize that this is an endless process with everwidening application.

Challenges for national growth and development are not limited to socioeconomic domains. Addressing governance deficits and implementation shortcomings are a major part of the solution. The problem, of course, comes in many forms and variations. They range from outdated policies and inadequate frameworks to casual implementation or even downright neglect. At the end of the day, it is as much about capabilities as it is about strategizing. If we bemoan the limitations of border infrastructure, we must ask ourselves the reasons for their current state. Quite apart from a deliberate neglect, the periphery will reflect in large measure the capabilities, or their limits, in the heartland. Leaving parts of the country underdeveloped or under-governed has its obvious risks, more so at the border. It also cannot be that we rise to special challenges, while neglecting the daily routine. Safeguarding borders, after all, is a 24x7 exercise, not only a crisis-driven response.

Our own debates in regard to national security need to recognize this value of putting in place the requisite structures and systems. Advocating sweeping solutions without laying the groundwork may be dramatic politics; it is not serious policy. On the contrary, our recent experience through the Gati Shakti initiative shows how much the national infrastructure can advance through stronger focus and integration. Breaking down silos and ensuring a more integrated governance process is just as important to national security. Underlying it is, of course, a basic willingness to fully recognize the challenges that the nation faces. By playing down issues like cross-border terrorism or competitive geopolitics, there has been a tendency to look away from the hard choices. In a more difficult world, that is going to be less possible.

Building Bharat is not a matter of falling back on our past; it is primarily about re-imagining our future.
