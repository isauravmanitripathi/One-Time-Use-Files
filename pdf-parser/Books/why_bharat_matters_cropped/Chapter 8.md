# Chapter 8. DFAI ING WITH CHINA

# Appreciating the Importance of Realism

There are few debates on the merits of realpolitik versus ideology that would match the conversations in India about China. Not surprisingly, it can also become one of nationalism versus internationalism, however misplaced the latter may be in this case. This starts from our early years of independence, meanders through an era of conflict, witnesses the subsequent normalization, and finally arrives at the choice between a 'Chindia' outlook and an 'India First' one. The impact of the border events in 2020 have recently revived this argument, contributing to a growing awareness of the complexity of the challenge before India. As a result, facets like trade, investment, technology and even contacts have begun to be viewed from an integrated perspective. The current state of the relationship is clearly unnatural; what its future holds seems ripe for debate.

In essence, the competing perspectives derive from the differing viewpoints set out in 1950 by PM Jawaharlal Nehru and his deputy, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. The latter was as hard-nosed as they come and least susceptible to protestations from neighbours that diverged from ground reality. In his estimation, India had done everything to allay China's apprehensions, but that country regarded us with suspicion and scepticism, perhaps mixed with a little hostility. Patel cautioned that for the first time after centuries, India's defence had to concentrate on two fronts simultaneously. And his view of China was that it had definite ambitions and aims that shaped its thinking about India in a less-than-friendly way.

In contrast, Nehru felt that Patel was overly suspicious and stated in a note to him on 18 November 1950 that it was inconceivable that China would 'undertake a wild adventure across the Himalayas'. Guided by a positive predisposition towards a leftist regime, he also felt that it is exceedingly unlikely that India may have to face any real military invasion from China in the foreseeable future. He appeared to take at face value the repeated references by China desiring friendship. To those who felt otherwise, he warned against losing our sense of perspective and giving way to unreasoning fears.

Each one eventually was to temper their view with some realization of the complications of a modus vivendi. The choice of words in what was an internal debate is obviously not quite diplomatic. But their gut instincts nevertheless were articulated quite clearly. One bet on a world of left-wing romanticism; the other voted for time-tested calculations about neighbours, especially big ones.

There were naturally multiple expressions of this divergence in approach, and that played out in the ensuing decades. As competition and even conflict characterized certain periods, public attitudes also started to take root accordingly. These may or may not have been shared by the governments of the day. Some displayed a consideration that was at variance with popular sentiment or even sought to shape opinion by advancing new objectives. Others were more hard-headed and would not let difficult issues be brushed under the carpet. Whatever the nuances, the defining imagery of diplomatic complacency remains the 1954 Panchsheel declaration.

If there is a common thread in the tendency to expect best-case scenarios, it is the optimism of a particular brand of Indian internationalism. One illustration of this Nehruvian approach was in the debate about permanent membership of the UNSC. Whether it was feasible to successfully assert our claim at that point of time is an issue in itself, and would we have been granted the same consideration had roles been reversed is a corollary to it. But there was not even an attempt by India to leverage this issue for national gain, either with China bilaterally or with other major powers. It appeared that the basics of diplomacy had given way to the influence of ideology. Instead, Nehru's decision in 1955 was to declare that India was not in a hurry to enter the Security Council at that time, even though it ought to be there. The first step, instead, was for China to take its rightful place. After that, the question of India could be considered separately. And no surprise, far from reciprocating Nehru's 'China First' policy, we are still waiting for that country to express support for our own similar ambitions!

A very different situation reveals how deeply this mindset was divorced from ground realities. It was November 1962 and Sela and Bomdila had fallen to the advancing Chinese forces. As the then PM sought American

help, he tellingly conveyed to the US President that because of its wider implications in the global context, India did not seek more comprehensive assistance. Apparently, we gave precedence to keeping distance from the West than to the defence of the nation! It is this lack of realism that has long dogged our approach to dealing with China. And it is precisely in this domain that we now see the difference.

If the positions and protestations of China got traction with an earlier generation, the state of Indian politics indicates that it is not altogether a vestige of the past. The previous driving factor was a desire to make common cause in the international arena. It was very much propelled by non-Western solidarity and Asian togetherness, more than tinged by ideological proclivity. Since then, public opinion has hardened and the earlier inclination to be excessively trusting is not maintainable. The world, too, is more transactional, and there have been decades of experience that influence thinking in India and China about each other.

How does the contemporary Nehruvian then approach the relationship? In times of stress as we currently are, like Nehru, the inclination is to indulge in ultra-nationalist rhetoric. This is done even while being in denial of the 1962 outcomes, when not actually misportraying it as something more recent. But ideology, habits and connections die hard. So, it is apparently necessary to have a double messaging, one for the more credulous within India and another for a different audience abroad. It is the latter that encourages them to advocate the view that China prizes harmony above all, without questioning why that does not apply to its neighbours. It also leads to admiration of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while overlooking its violation of India's sovereignty. There are less-than-subtle suggestions of China's unstoppability by describing its rise as a force of nature and ill-concealed sympathy for its model of economic growth and technology appropriation.

But it is the actions more than the articulation of these Chindians that are of deeper concern. By consciously underrating the China challenge, any sense of preparation in India was undermined; till the change of 2014. The neglect of the border infrastructure was paralleled by an unwillingness to accelerate industrialization and create deep strengths. Even now, 'Make in India' endeavours are attacked by them while ostensibly expressing concern at the trade imbalance with China. The combination of politics, policies and populism lowered our national guard and still continues to target our national

morale. Not surprisingly, this is about as far as we can be from the traditions of realism.

In the years that have passed, the Nehru–Patel dichotomy of approaches has continued within the Indian system. It finds resonance in each era through the issues of the day, from the boundary question and border areas management to FTAs and technology issues. Not all of the debate is restricted to its bilateral format. Understandably, given the influence of the two countries, it spills over into the global arena just as easily. Issues like connectivity, debt, development and maritime claims have also become contentious. Overall, there is no question that many of them today are being approached with a higher degree of thought about their implications. The era when Indian policymakers were sanguine about the 'String of Pearls' did finally end in 2014.

But there is also a fundamental issue of defining national interests clearly, defending them vigorously and appreciating the nature of power. Asian or even developing world solidarity may have its place, but it was never enough to counter the competitive instincts of a neighbour. Indeed, it is this kernel of the 1950 debate that continues to be relevant.

Today, there are animated conversations across the world on how best to engage China. Naturally, this is even more intense in India, given our proximity as well as the border events of 2020 and thereafter. Polemical positions within India may be driven by political tactics; it is the underlying policies and actions that speak for actual thinking. The true stance of various political forces vis-à-vis China is not episodic, whatever may be the temporary posture. The realists among them hold a worldview that stresses building national capabilities, which puts key concerns like terrorism firmly on the table, calls out actions on unsustainable debt and opaque connectivity, and approaches global developments with national security foremost in mind. It is precisely this approach that will push for upgrading the boundary infrastructure, as it has after 2014. In addition, they would deploy an Indian 5G stack, understand the value of critical and emerging technologies, and, not least, seek from the turbulence of our current era better solutions for our advancement.

Indeed, the nature of the challenges we faced predicate that India's analysis continuously monitors how the rest of the world is responding. Much of what the world faces today has come out of miscalculation on the part of some powers and its intelligent usage by others. But the course of history is

far from linear, and even major nations are not impervious to becoming complacent or making errors. In fact, a common failing is to seek immediate gains at the cost of larger credibility. The realist, therefore, has to objectively analyse the state of play while being sceptical about the inevitability of events and trends. It is on this score that our epics may shed some light.

In world affairs, as indeed in human relationships, parties tend to help others out of goodwill, generosity or calculation. In real life, one can often spill into the other. The trigger of the Ramayana narrative is actually an act of exceptional trust, the two boons that King Dasaratha gave to his wife Kaikeyi on the battlefield. While involved in a war between the *asura* Sambara and the king of the gods Indra, Dasaratha was rescued by her when severely wounded in a night attack. It was these promises that Kaikeyi invoked to send Rama to his exile in the jungle and demand that her own son Bharata be crowned king.

If we consider the boons to be latent capabilities that were exercised when the time came, this episode is an object lesson on injudicious sharing. In recent decades, international relations have also witnessed how countries and economies were built up, perhaps less as an act of gratitude and more as one of utility. This was especially visible in the last years of the Cold War, when it came to exercising military and other pressures through third parties. But a lack of understanding of the players involved led to long-term consequences.

The Western world found that the Islamic card that it played against the USSR came back to haunt them within a decade. And when it comes to strategic understandings, the economic benefits that China obtained became the foundation for the upturning of the global order and the contemporary competition that we witness now. India, too, carries the consequences of its own past dealings. Its strong advocacy of Chinese interests in the 1950s was obviously not repaid in kind. It is bad enough to forget that gratitude has a short shelf-life in diplomacy; it is even more so when basics of diplomatic calculation are overridden by misplaced beliefs of political solidarity.

In personal terms, vulnerabilities are often created as a result of thoughtlessness. On occasion, it could also be an emotional response to a challenge. To some degree, that could be extrapolated to explain the behaviour of nation-states as well. But a more credible explanation can be found in the mindset of strategic complacency that polities and rulers often display.

A telling example is the case of the key antagonist, the demon-king Ravana of Lanka. In that era, exceptional figures performed the most exacting penance that could be rewarded by their wishes being granted by the Gods. In this case, Ravana was given the boon of invincibility by the creator Brahma. But in his arrogance, he invoked it only against what he saw as likely threats, *devas* and *gandharvas*, *asuras* and *kinnaras*, *nagas* and *rakshasas*, all creatures other than men. He left out humankind because he could not even envisage that such puny beings could be threatening. And it was for that reason that Lord Vishnu took a human form, that of Lord Rama, to kill Ravana.

The issue here is the threat that was overlooked, which thereby created a window of vulnerability. There is another lesson, too, from Ravana's behavioural characteristics and that,

paradoxically, is the attitude of those who feel wronged by history. He is badgered by his advisers to regain their dominant status in Lanka, a land that was once ruled by his maternal grandfather Sumali. Ravana consequently begins by displacing his elder brother Kuber, who comes from a different stock. But it then becomes an endless quest, powered by a sense of entitlement and absence of restraint. There are important learnings here for entrenched and rising powers alike, both in charting a path and in managing their ambitions. Total security will always be a fruitless quest.

A different example presents itself much earlier in the epic, when Bharata and accompanying sages try to persuade Rama to return to Ayodhya after the death of King Dasaratha. The sage Jabali makes a particularly impassioned appeal, underlining that the promise that Rama made to his father was no longer binding after the latter's demise. This provokes Rama's anger and he questions how trust would be maintained if vows were so lightly discarded. The sages appreciate his stance while confessing that they had to make their best effort to bring him back. The point eventually is about credibility, not just as a personal virtue but as a larger systemic underpinning. If states do not honour agreements and adhere to obligations, they must weigh any tactical gains against the larger damage that they have done to their reputation.

#### **A MULTIDIMENSIONAL CHALLENGE**

The Galwan clash between China and India in June 2020 saw the first fatalities on their border in 45 years. It was not just the underpinning of peace and tranquillity that was shattered as a result. Working assumptions about their relationship built up over four decades were now suddenly questionable. China's disregard for established agreements, which led to this turn of events, also has its own further implications. But even as India gears up to take on a new level of concerns on its northern borders, there are cascading questions posed by China's posture. Together, these immediate developments and long-term concerns create a multidimensional challenge to Indian foreign policy.

Among the many issues that India has to address in its endeavour to ascend in the world order, the relationship with China undoubtedly presents the most complex problem. On the one hand, the parallel but differential rise of the two polities constitutes the core of global re-balancing. Willy-nilly, the two countries have ended up creating greater space in the international architecture. Together, they are drivers of what was touted in more optimistic days as heralding an 'Asian century'. At one time, there was even talk of concluding a bilateral FTA, a discussion that was set to rest only after 2013.

On some aspects of the development debate, they find themselves on the same side.

Yet, an intractable boundary dispute and different politico-economic models have created a competitive narrative in this very period. That they are immediate neighbours has added to the intricacy of their ties. A common periphery and balance of power have also contributed to a sense of rivalry. It is also a reality that China's reach and influence has extended significantly during this period. A lack of appreciation of this aspect 15 years ago has added to our vulnerability in the Indian Ocean.

From the Indian perspective, the answers are in a combination of realms, many of them centring on building our national strengths and upgrading our infrastructure. But there is also a conceptual transformation underway in the diplomatic approach. The global landscape today offers many more opportunities for India to leverage, once it goes back to the realist tradition.

The serious debate about the future of this relationship today dwells on how to establish the most advantageous modus vivendi. Because it is an immediate neighbour, China's rapid growth has been particularly impactful, both on the balance with India as well as its presence in their common and near periphery. Moreover, for various reasons, China has not given the same regard to India's rise as the rest of the world. In their ties, the present is very much shaped by the past, whether we speak of the ground situation, national power or even sentiment. And the past is not without its share of problems.

At the same time, their cumulative effect on the established world order is creating greater openings for its change. The fact is that neither can wish the other away and both clearly have the ability to run the long race. Even otherwise, they had to take the rest of the world into consideration when it came to calculations about each other. Perhaps, this is more so in the current global scenario. If and how they come to terms seriously will not only shape the prospects of the two countries but that of the continent, and perhaps even the world now.

Most Indians are familiar with the modern history of our bilateral ties. Perhaps not everyone may know every nuance of how it evolved. But generally, people have a sense of the ups and downs of this relationship. The first decade of the 1950s can only be described as one of Indian naiveté. On multiple issues, Indian foreign policy took up China's cause to an extent that it impacted its own relationship with the West. What is important to note is

that this criticism, whether on bilateral or global issues, is not a retrospective one but offered even as events were then unfolding.

After the 1962 border conflict, India and China exchanged ambassadors only in 1976, a decision taken by the Indira Gandhi government. It then took till 1988 for the first Indian prime ministerial visit to China after 1954, that of Rajiv Gandhi. And indeed, the re-building of our ties was actually a very painstaking endeavour. This, if you think about it, is something of a paradox. Because, do remember that India was among the early nations to actually recognize the People's Republic of China (PRC). However, the quality of our ties in many ways was determined by the border conflict and the three distant decades thereafter.

It took a conscious effort on the part of both nations to orchestrate a recovery and restore a sense of normalcy. As a result, for the next many years, interactions and exchanges grew steadily in many areas. China became one of our largest trading partners; a very significant source of investment, even of technology; a participant in projects and infrastructure building; and a substantial destination for tourism and education. As for the border areas, a detailed and practical set of understandings and agreements focussed on their management, even as negotiations were conducted on the resolution of the boundary dispute.

The advancement of India–China ties since 1988 was obviously predicated on ensuring that peace and tranquillity in the border areas would be maintained and that the Line of Actual Control (LAC) observed and respected by both sides. For this reason, it was agreed in 1993 that no activities of either side shall overstep the LAC; that the two sides shall keep military forces along the LAC to a level compatible with good relations; and that prior notification for military exercises near the LAC would be given.

In 1996, these commitments were not only reaffirmed but further developed through additional provisions. It was decided that the two sides would reduce or limit the number of army, border defence and paramilitary forces along the LAC and exchange data accordingly. More importantly, it was explicitly recognized that large-scale military exercises involving more than one division (15,000 troops) would not be held in close proximity to the LAC. If that were to be conducted, the strategic direction of the main force involved shall not be towards the other side. The 1996 agreement also provided for prior notification if exercises involving more than one brigade

(5,000 troops) were to take place. This would include date of completion of the exercise and de-induction of the troops involved.

At the same time, the 1993 agreement to jointly check and determine segments of the LAC with differing perceptions was upgraded to a shared objective of speeding up the process of clarification and confirmation of the LAC. Not just that, there were subsequently detailed understandings in 2005 and 2013 on handling situations of friction, if they were to arise.

In the years that passed, we obviously did not make significant progress on arriving at a common understanding of the alignment of the LAC in the India–China border areas. The appointment of Special Representatives (SRs) in 2003 did intensify the engagement, not just on the boundary question but on the larger relationship as well. A specific mechanism was also established in 2012 to address issues pertaining to the border areas. But all the while, there was also increasing construction of border infrastructure and depth-area logistics on the Chinese side. In contrast, the belief then in India was that our own border areas were best left undeveloped. This turned out to be a serious misjudgement that has cost us dearly.

Since 2014, there have been better efforts by India to reduce this very considerable infrastructure gap that had developed over three decades. Greater commitments raised the budget to four times the previous level. A better road-building record, which doubled construction and tripled tunnelling, was also indicative of improvement. Nevertheless, the infrastructure differential remains significant and, as we have seen in 2020, consequential. It, therefore, takes considerable operational ingenuity to make up for the lapses of the previous decades.

For all the differences and disagreements India and China may have had on the boundary, the central fact was that border areas remained fundamentally peaceful between 1975 and 2020. That is why the events in Galwan have so profoundly disturbed the relationship. They signalled a disregard for commitments about minimizing troop levels, informing about their deployment and movement, and respecting the status quo. The combination of these steps heightened the associated risks of breaching peace and tranquillity, with the results that we all know well by now. The impact this has had on both public and political opinions in India has been profound.

Significantly, India has never received a credible explanation for the change in China's stance nor convincing reasons for massing of troops in the border areas. It is a different matter that our own forces have responded

appropriately and held their own in challenging circumstances. The issue before us is what the Chinese posture signals, how it evolves and what implications it may have for the future of our ties.

Even before 2020, the India–China relationship witnessed decisions and events that reflected the duality of coexistence and competition. We saw trade grow dramatically, though its one-sided nature made it increasingly controversial. In sectors like power and telecommunications, Chinese companies successfully obtained access to India and built impressive market shares. The number of Indian students in China grew, as indeed did Indian tourists who visited there.

In the global arena, India and China made common cause on some developmental and economic issues, notably in climate change (UNFCCC) and trade (WTO). Our membership of plurilateral groups like BRICS and RIC was also a meeting point.

Yet, when it came to interests and aspirations, many of the divergences were also apparent. China started the practice of issuing stapled visas for residents of Jammu & Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh. Their reluctance to deal with India's military command in the northern sector led to the freezing of exchanges for some time. Water-marking of Chinese passports covered Indian provinces within their boundaries in an attempt to assert claims. Border area frictions continued to grow as China's infrastructure steadily advanced.

In India, these multiple realities naturally fed an increasingly animated debate. There was a powerful lobby that not only advocated deepening ties but even exempting China from the limited security scrutiny that was then in place. To some, such expanded cooperation was a compensation for the improvement in India–US ties that was then taking place. This perhaps was buttressed by a natural proclivity to build on a Nehruvian outlook to China, as much as to the world. Discussions on the boundary question were, therefore, publicly projected far more positively than the actual progress justified. And as trade expanded, active proponents in its favour came into their own.

Yet, the systemic response remained much more cognizant of hard realities, seeking to put in place filters of various kinds, pushing back on boundary-related issues and increasingly highlighting the trade deficit. The last was effective insofar as the commitment to an FTA was finally abandoned.

As both India and China moved into a more confident era, their *inter se* relationship also witnessed additional issues of difference. This was visible in 2013 when the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was first announced. Frictions in border areas continued to grow, though they remained below a certain threshold till 2020. China's blocking of UN listing of Pakistani terrorists involved in attacks on India became a matter of growing controversy. As the CPEC advanced, becoming part of the BRI, the violation of Indian sovereignty was deemed unacceptable. China's opposition to Indian membership of the NSG created another problem, hardly mitigated by its undermining of any efforts towards UN reform. And when it came to trade, promises of better market access looked less and less credible in the absence of delivery.

As the aggregate consequences of these developments began to be felt, the two nations sought at the SCO Summit in Astana in 2017 to limit damage by not allowing differences to become disputes. At the same time, they tried to explore the factors of stability in the relationship. Subsequent summits in Wuhan and Mamallapuram were largely in that direction. But far from mitigating differences, they have ended up witnessing a relationship under exceptional stress as a result of the events of 2020.

### **LESSONS FROM THE PAST**

Given the gravity of its state now, it is natural that those who study the relationship will be particularly concerned where our ties are heading. It is hard to offer a definitive answer at this point in time. Whether it is our immediate concerns or more distant prospects, the fact is that the development of our ties can only be based on mutuality. Indeed, the three mutuals, mutual respect, mutual sensitivity and mutual interests, are its determining factors. There are discussions underway through various mechanisms on disengagement at the border areas. Many of the close-up deployments of the two sides in frictional areas have been resolved on the basis of equal and mutual security. But any that remain and the larger issue of de-escalation will continue to cast their shadow on bilateral cooperation.

It is untenable to suggest that there can be a return to 'business as usual' for the larger relationship when the situation in the border areas is far from normal. Looking beyond, when a neighbour prepares, trains and exhorts, it is wise to focus on the capability rather than the professed intent, especially in

a culture where public rhetoric is taken seriously. At the minimum, therefore, whatever engagement is feasible has to be undertaken with eyes extremely wide open.

In that context, the Indian side has to draw lessons even from the near past when it comes to handling China. To begin with, the public characterization of our ties is important. By describing it as a 'strategic partnership' in 2005, there was conceptual confusion about its real nature. Clearly, this description sat ill with unresolved boundary differences, growing transgressions and competitive neighbourhood activities. In fact, what it led to was the very complacency that made India underestimate the implications of Chinese-built ports in Hambantota and Gwadar.

Similarly, ritualistic reaffirmations of territorial integrity could not continue in a one-sided way. A balance has therefore been introduced. The neglect of the border infrastructure also spoke of a casual attitude towards the boundary dispute till 2014. Even more concerning was the underplaying of Sino-Pakistani cooperation in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), until the current Indian government took a firm stand in 2017 on the BRI. Despite that, there are some from the old order who still advocate softening our stance.

On the economic side, it would appear astounding to many now that an FTA with China could even be contemplated. In such an atmosphere, informed scrutiny of activities within our country was not easy. The collapse of the Quad in 2007 in face of China's objections sent its own message, making its revival a decade later that much harder. The very term 'Chindia' that was in vogue a decade earlier, with all its Nehruvian connotations, underlines why the loss of strategic clarity can be so damaging.

Given how severely developments since 2020 have eroded confidence and trust, it is obvious that stabilizing ties is the first order of the day. How to embark on that endeavour is best captured by certain propositions that reflect both experience and expectations. To begin with, agreements already reached, such as those of 1993 and 1996, must be adhered to in their entirety, in letter as much as in spirit. Cherry-picking individual provisions are hardly likely to advance the objective of finding common ground.

Where the border areas are concerned, the LAC must be strictly observed and respected; any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo cannot be countenanced. We cannot be in denial that peace and tranquillity in the border areas is the foundational basis for development of relations in other domains. If they are disturbed, so inevitably will the rest of the relationship. This is

quite apart from the issue of progress in the boundary negotiations that are being separately held. Attempts to conflate one for the other will inevitably be seen through; it will never obfuscate the problems created by the developments of 2020.

While both nations are committed to a multipolar world, there should be an acceptance that a multipolar Asia is one of its essential constituents. Obviously, each nation will have its own interests, concerns and priorities, but sensitivity to them has to be shown by both sides. At the end of the day, relationships between major states are reciprocal in nature. As rising powers, each will have their own set of aspirations and their pursuit too cannot be ignored. There will always be divergences and differences but their management is essential to our ties. And finally, civilizational states like India and China must always take the long view. Departures from these axioms, as we witnessed in 2020, have serious implications.

For a variety of reasons, it is common for the Chinese to speak today of 'international relations in the new era'. There is much that this terminology signifies, as is often the case with them. Whether we agree or not, what is undeniable is that the world order has now entered a very different phase from how it was envisaged after 1945. Without exaggeration, the rise of China is the most profound change in global politics since that of the US and the USSR after the Second World War. It has not just implications and lessons but significant policy consequences, especially for neighbours. India, therefore, would also do well to regard its own relationship with China as also having entered a new era. If there were any doubts on this score, the changed Chinese posture in the border areas has demonstrated that graphically. India is historically used to thinking of a Chinese presence to its north. For the last two decades, China is also rapidly growing as a maritime power, and we will also have to anticipate activities in the south.

Since there is so much flux underway, this might also be an opportune moment to reflect on how China and India have approached each other traditionally and whether there are indeed takeaways for the Indian side.

Looking back at seven decades of engagement, it would be fair to state that India has essentially taken a bilateral approach in respect of outstanding issues with China. There are many reasons for this, including a sense of Asian solidarity and a suspicion of third-party interests that emanated from other experiences. Brief exceptions to this are mostly in circumstances when PM Nehru was compelled to turn to the US and UK after Bomdila fell to the

People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1962. To some extent, the post-1971 relationship with the USSR also encouraged India to look at its relationship with China in the larger global context. But these were not lasting, and after 1988, India reverted to the earlier tradition of engagement without leveraging. Underlying this narrow view was also a belief that problems between the two countries were resolvable in the near term.

On its part, India has been remarkably consistent and steady in its approach to the resolution of differences, including on the boundary question. As a result, Indians have generally been less contextualized in their approach and do not readily correlate the relationship with developments in larger world politics. There was neither an inclination to practise balance of power nor indeed an appetite for using opportunities presented by international developments. Nehru's own excessive caution in 1962 was one illustration of this belief. In fact, Indian policy in the past has exhibited such a degree of self-restraint that it led inadvertently to the expectation that others can have influence, if not a veto, over its choices. That era, too, ended in 2014.

The Chinese approach to India has been quite contrasting. While there have undoubtedly been sentiments of Asian commonness expressed from time to time, these have not obfuscated time-tested approaches to dealing with neighbours. So much so that Pakistan's membership of Western military alliances was overlooked by China in the 1950–60s as part of a balancing strategy. A decade later, this was taken to higher levels through nuclear and missile collaboration that specifically targeted India. When it comes to bilateral negotiations, China has focussed on differentials rather than on maintaining the logic of its positions. There have been radical shifts in its stance, especially in regard to its claims and priorities on the boundary question.

Overall, it can be asserted that in keeping with its fundamental world view, contemporary China has treated its relationship with India as a subset of a larger engagement with the world. Modulations accordingly reflect not just the bilateral dynamic but the global situation as a whole.

It is worthwhile to dwell for a moment here on the relevance of the West in the unfolding of India–China relations. This is often the subject of Chinese polemics, and Indians then tend to go on the defensive. There is no question that given its dominance, the West has been very much a factor of calculations for both parties. But the record shows that it is actually China that has been more active in bringing it into play.

For two decades after the PRC was founded, India's ties with the West were relatively much better, though there were issues of divergence. Indeed, China itself was key among them, especially between India and the US during the Nehru–Krishna Menon period. It was, therefore, something of an irony that as ties worsened over the border dispute, China's portrayal of India's relationship with the West started to change. When we finally did turn to the West, it was actually only as Chinese forces overwhelmed Indian defences in November 1962. Yet within a decade, it was China that made a sharp aboutturn through its rapprochement with the US, reflected in the visits of Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon. The resulting China–Pakistan–US triangle, thereafter, posed a serious challenge that could be answered only through the Indo-Soviet Treaty of 1971.

It is noteworthy that in pursuance of its interests, China had no hesitation in establishing global coordination with the Western bloc. There was a time when it even publicly advocated the formation of a 'single line' of nations in the same latitude (China, the US, Japan and Europe) to counter the USSR and its friends. Vietnam was kept in check through direct pressure and India, more indirectly, through Pakistan. This was the history that was sought to be put behind when India and China came to terms pragmatically in 1988.

But it is still one worth recalling for many reasons. To start with, China had built up enough constituencies of support in the West to insulate its economic cooperation from whatever political differences may crop up from time to time. This allowed it to reap economic and technological rewards while still engaging in political disputation. India must, therefore, fall neither for a simplistic description of national contradictions nor assume a zero-sum game between China and the West. Then, for all the homilies that are now handed out about the evil intentions of the West, Indians would do well to remember the advocacy of a China–US G2 last decade. Given inconstancy of policies, these are tendencies that must never be entirely disregarded. After all, a little more than a decade ago, China was making common cause with the US on South Asia. In contrast to China's swing from one extreme to the other, India has maintained a stable and evolutionary approach to the West.

How, when and to what extent India should engage the West is its national prerogative. The expectation that we must conform to the ups and downs of another nation's policy is unrealistic and unjustified. And, of course, previous events have demonstrated that when they so wish, India and China can keep their ties on a positive trajectory and insulated from other

relationships. Expressing anxieties about the West should not become a cover to constrain the legitimate interests and choices of the other party. Therefore, when such arguments are advanced, the best response is to place a mirror in the room!

## **PREPARING FOR A DIFFICULT ERA**

India and China are quite distinct in their persona and behaviour, even though they are neighbours. As it is not a command polity, public opinion plays a much greater role in India's perception of its external relationships. It is not only more quickly exercised but when that happens, also slower to forget. Factors like faith and values have a relevance that is not readily appreciated by those who do not share them. Moreover, reactions are less determined by cost–benefit analysis, and perceptions tend to be more permanent. The interplay of internal politics with foreign policy can also be complicated in a democratic and pluralistic society like India. We may be seeing public reversals in the traditional stance of political players who embraced China earlier on matters ranging from security to economics. But transient politics should not let us hide the deeper truths. Insofar as border areas are concerned, the outcomes of 1962 and continuous neglect of the infrastructure have to be effectively addressed through determined responses. And that is exactly the exercise underway.

When it comes to the border, India stands significantly disadvantaged by the topography. The nature of the terrain makes the boundary far harder to secure from the south than from the north. This is further compounded by the outcome of the 1962 war. In many sectors, China vastly benefited by the 38,000 sq. km. territory that it gained during the conflict. In fact, even recent developments like the bridge building across Pangong Tso and establishment of border villages take place in areas whose control passed into their hands 60 years ago. And the infrastructure neglect till 2014 compounded this predicament.

India, therefore, needs to factor in these legacy complications while refashioning a response for a more difficult era. Some of that is to step up its efforts on the ground, some to explore effective technology options. Given the manifest commitment to defend its interests, an optimal combination will always emerge to be continually refreshed. All of that has come into sharper

focus for a government that is fully seized of the magnitude of the challenges before it.

The second issue is that of comprehensive national power. Naturally, there are outcomes that reflect the lack of purpose on the Indian side till 2014. Technology and tactics can offer some compensations on their own score. India is, therefore, compelled to imaginatively address the problem of dealing with a powerful adversary. Policymakers of the past may shirk their responsibility, but the record is there for all of us to see. Indeed, we have already noted a radical shift in the positioning of many who advocated a very different outlook in office.

The sensible response, of course, is to build deep strengths as rapidly as possible, where necessary, in partnership with others. The current geopolitical scenario offers more possibilities in this respect. But there must be both the full awareness and the greater determination to exploit such opportunities. Nothing is more important than securing our borders.

There are even larger developments pertaining to India's status that feed into the problems of our times. We are all aware how much Partition diminished our strategic stature. But what it also did was create the basis for a subcontinental balance of power. And even worse, the incomplete exercise of sovereignty in Jammu & Kashmir in 1948 allowed a physical contiguity that is now a matter of deep concern. Ideological blinkers were responsible for the wilful neglect of the first principles of international relations in the past. Even open Sino-Pakistan collaboration since 1963 has consistently been underestimated, failing to prepare us for what was to come next. When the CPEC was unveiled as part of the BRI, its forthright rejection by India was second-guessed publicly by some in the country. Excuses were advanced and workarounds sought to be invented, all the while ignoring a clear message from China.

In its current state, it is natural that there will be a debate in the relationship about ways of mitigation. An issue that presents itself is whether intensive economics is an effective answer to complicated politics. There was a period when significant sections of opinion in India believed in such possibilities. When China was described as a 'strategic partner' in 2005, this was in the expectation that the optimistic view of ties would prevail.

In the last decade-and-a-half, those hopes have been belied. Economics has hardly helped in stabilizing politics and, to add insult to injury, actually become a cause of problems in itself. One part of it is the reality of global

supply chains that emanate so much from China, but the other is the fact that we have made it so hard till recently to undertake manufacturing in India. Indeed, there are influential voices that still argue that this is neither the competence nor the destiny of India! The result is that market-access challenges and a mounting deficit have made trade with China increasingly problematic. This is fuelled by the contrasting shares that technology and digital businesses have in each other's markets. The irony is that those who claim to be concerned are the very parties responsible for this predicament.

Indians must realize that only a sustained effort in building domestic alternatives can rectify the situation. But there is no doubt that the Covid pandemic has heightened awareness of the risks of such massive external exposure. This has only been accentuated by the concerns emanating from the escalated friction in the border areas. '*Atmanirbhar* Bharat' has now emerged as much as an expression of strategic response as of economic capability. Even though there is a strong proclivity in India to deal with China more bilaterally, some of the global debates of our times do intrude into the ties. This is particularly so in respect of domains like supply chains, technology, data and connectivity. In fact, the more global China becomes, the more these larger discussions will shape the response of its interlocutors.

Like the rest of the world, India, too, is grappling with the reality that the established economic models are unable to cater to the realities of the day. It is clear that the logic of comparative advantage does not work with respect to those who are autonomous of market forces. And obviously, the world is simply not geared to take on the challenge of unrestricted competition, when every factor of production and consumption can be leveraged.

Where India is concerned, it is only a departure from an established way of doing business that can yield results. And there are transformations underway, that of resilience and reliability when it comes to supply chains and trust and transparency when it comes to data. These offer real possibilities to build greater national capacities in various fields.

In the interim, it is essential that India is cautious about exposing its economy more substantially to unfair trade. This is not protectionism but economic self-defence. Resisting the lure of quick fixes is also necessary to build up domestic supply chains. When it comes to global competition, India's choices are best made in terms of what serves its interests well. These considerations must guide its choice of partners on connectivity initiatives and technology development as well.

The ability of India and China to cooperate in multilateral and plurilateral forums has naturally had some effect on their ties. Even now, there are some regional, developmental and political platforms that they coinhabit. At the same time, the last decade has seen the emergence of new mechanisms dedicated to promoting the welfare of the global commons where the interests of the two neighbours diverge. It is helpful for the overall India–China relationship if the sum total of their diplomatic activities remains on the positive side of the ledger. But this is not that easy to realize given the differences on display when it comes to the expansion of the NSG, reform of the UN or the spread of the BRI.

Accommodating the rise of others while in the midst of your own cannot be easy. When it comes to strengthening multipolarity, India will obviously first evaluate how much of it applies in Asia itself. Similarly, when it comes to rebalancing, Indian choices will lean towards those options that accelerate its growth. But what should be clear is that a nation like India, which long viewed sovereign equality as a fundamental principle of international relations, will continue to do so in the times ahead.

Seen from a narrow bilateral perspective, it is not unexpected that the rise of India has been underplayed by China. Efforts to structurally shape its shared neighbourhood is naturally of deep interest to us. Prominent among that has been the BRI, one of whose corridors, we have noted, violates India's sovereignty. The maritime space is also beginning to undergo a noticeable transformation, one clearly not to India's benefit.

In all of this, the global commons has been left to the commitment of likeminded partners who share a sense of responsibility. India's interests and influence have widened eastwards at this very time. The conceptualization of the Indo-Pacific and the emergence of the Quad are examples of a contemporary response to emerging demands. They also underline the importance of not according a veto to others on sovereign choices.

When it comes to India–China relations, references are often made to it being the foundation of an Asian century. This goes back to some remarks that were made by Deng Xiaoping more than three decades ago. Events of the last few years, however, point to the converse reality that their inability to get along can jeopardize such prospects. The search for a modus vivendi, therefore, becomes a quest for multipolarity in Asia. And that, in turn, has evolved into a larger debate about exercise of choices, concerns about the global commons, respect for international law, and an engagement on the

basis of sovereign equality. In its economic dimension, there is a parallel debate underway on the need for fair trade, the importance of equal opportunities, the compulsions of risk mitigation, and building resilient and reliable supply chains while promoting trust and transparency.

In the games that nations play, political romanticism and cultural pride can often become manipulative cards. Forging a united front against the West and suggesting that Asia must be for Asians are tried-and-tested tactics that appeal to the insecurity of the post-colonial world. The reality, however, is remorselessly unsentimental and much more competitive. In a globalized world, keeping others out while seeking access to their regions is unrealistic. In a strategic one, partners should be chosen on interests and not on the basis of sentiments or prejudices. A more culturally assured India would surely see the difference.

India's answers for a more balanced and stable relationship with China lie in a range of options across multiple domains. Given the developments of 2020, they obviously centre around an effective defence of the border. This was undertaken even in the midst of Covid. A fitter and more technologyenabled military is evidently the need of the day. Peace and tranquillity on the border areas clearly remain the basis for normal relations. This is far from equating it with resolving the boundary question. The reality is that even this lower bar was breached in 2020! Economically, further progress in expanding manufacturing and promoting '*atmanirbhar* Bharat' is key. Internationally, building more relationships and promoting understanding of its interests will strengthen India. We must continue to compete effectively, especially in our immediate periphery.

Establishing a stable balance between India and China after 2020 is not easy. If that has to emerge, it can only become sustainable on the basis of three mutuals. The international situation could even contribute to that process, as India strives to find an optimal positioning in the East–West and North–South divides. But there has to be an acceptance of multipolarity in Asia. The last few years have been a period of serious challenge, both for the relationship and for the prospects of the continent. The continuation of tensions will have its consequences. New normals of posture will inevitably lead to new normals of strategy. Whether a long-term view of their ties will prevail is the big question.

The India–China relationship is now truly at a crossroads. The national will, policy confidence, global relationships and growing capabilities of

India are on display. Choices that are made will have profound repercussions, not just for the two nations but for the entire world. Respecting the three mutuals and applying the resulting propositions to the growth of their ties may help both nations to make the right decisions. That is best done when the relationship is approached with clinical analysis, global strategy and delivery on the ground. It is only when our approach to China is steeped in realism that we will strengthen our image before the world as Bharat.
