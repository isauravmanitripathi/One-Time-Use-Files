## A TRANSFORMATIONAL DECADE

### Laying the Foundations of a Leading Power

 $\bullet$  n 2015, PM Narendra Modi publicly articulated India's quest to become a leading power one day. Some treated it as a statement of arrival when it was actually meant to be an expression of an aspiration. In the decade that has passed, it has also become clearer that this is now work in serious progress. While inaugurating the Bharat Mandapam in 2023, the same thinking was reiterated by the PM in a determination to emerge as the thirdlargest global economy. And a year before, in a departure from tradition, he made a public appeal to think and plan for an entire era, not just a term in office. This was characterized as *Amrit Kaal*, a quarter century with its goal as India's emergence as a developed nation.

Each of these assertions has a profound foreign-policy implication, especially because they are being voiced not merely as a broad ambition but with specific targets and goals for which India is now strategizing. The achievements of the last decade point to how steadily and systematically the foundations are being laid for a global footprint.

From his first day in office as the PM, Narendra Modi put his stamp on the nation's foreign policy. He demonstrated diplomatic imagination by inviting neighbouring leaders to his oath-taking ceremony in 2014, a step that orthodox thinking had not even contemplated. His US visit later that year served to bring on stage a new kind of public diplomacy. He infused greater energy into Indian endeavours, reaching out with an intensity and spread that was so different from his predecessors. In the time that has passed, PM Modi tabled fresh ideas and initiatives in various geographies and domains, ranging from energy and climate to counter-terrorism and connectivity. He has been active on key global issues, often directly shaping the outcomes.

This is not someone who is content with simply extrapolating on what he inherited. Instead, he has given foreign policy greater strategic clarity,

stronger conceptual basis, heightened activity and better delivery. This was evident in the manner in which the immediate neighbourhood was approached and the extended one was engaged. It was also visible in the assessment of the global order and building stronger relationships with major power centres. There was then the planned cultivation of middle powers, of regions and sub-regions. This was paralleled by publicly upholding the interests of the Global South. The delivery of Indian projects there was radically improved, making them a visible symbol of a New India. First responder capabilities were effectively demonstrated, as was the ability to look after our citizens abroad when in distress. Fresh strategic concepts emerged, and so did new mechanisms and memberships.

The cumulative results were visible in India's higher global standing now. In other circumstances, it could well be called a transformational decade. But given the ambitious objectives set out, real changes have just begun. There is still a considerable road to traverse.

Nations and individuals come of age through demonstrations of strength. In the Ramayana, the relevant episode is the stringing of Shiva's bow by Rama when he goes to visit Janaka, the king of Mithila. This was a weapon of extraordinary capability that Shiva himself had given for safekeeping to Janaka's ancestor Devaratha, at a particular time when he could not trust himself to keep his emotions in check. Janaka had decided that he would allow only the person who could lift and string this bow to marry his daughter Sita. And it was this feat that not only ensured the marriage of Rama and Sita but announced the arrival of Rama into the world of warriors. This was immediately tested in a confrontation with Parasurama, a sage who obsessively fought the warrior community. Rama bested him by capturing and stringing Vishnu's bow made by Vishwakarma, the counterpart of Shiva's bow he had just strung, which had first come into the possession of Parasurama's grandfather. These were but the beginnings, and at every stage of his journey, Lord Rama overcame obstacles to realize his true potential.

Major tests do not come out of the blue. More often than not, they are preceded by earlier experiences of a significant nature. That is the natural evolution of people as it is of states. In Rama's case, this first happened when sages demanded his services to deal with demons that were ruining their sacrifices. Rama's father, Dasaratha, was naturally reluctant to expose him to such risks but finally consented with great hesitation. This attitude is also a systemic response in most countries when confronted with new threats.

In Rama's case, he first had to overcome the female demon Tataka in the Kamasrama forest. The next encounter in Siddhasrama was with more serious adversaries, the demons Maricha and Subahu. One was vanquished and the other reduced to ashes. Rama and Lakshmana then traversed the hermitage of Sage Gautama, where Rama was destined to

revive the former's wife Ahalya who had been cursed earlier. It was only thereafter that the brothers proceeded to Mithila to perform the feat with Shiva's bow.

For a nation like India, it is to be expected that there will be rivers and mountains to cross as it moves towards becoming a leading power. Some of them could be direct challenges, others a product of larger circumstances. There could be recurring issues, as indeed Lord Rama was to experience with the demon Maricha. At the end of the day, the rising of a power is an exercise in perseverance, endurance and mental strength. If we are to look for a contemporary reflection of these events where India is concerned, this may be in building its infrastructure, upgrading its human resources, countering territorial challenges, developing deep strengths, exercising the nuclear option and improving the quality of governance. As it moves on to the next stage of its rise, India, too, needs to broaden its vistas, be more aware of competitors and strengthen its comprehensive national power.

#### **THE NEW MANDALA**

In any assessment, it is relatively easy to point to individual events and outcomes to demonstrate a sense of change. That may not be altogether without merit, but it cannot be the full story. Even inflection points are just that; they only serve to highlight a larger trend. Given the scale of what India is seeking to do over an extended period, it would be completely natural to expect that there would be a comprehensive approach to achieving its goals. And indeed, that is exactly what has emerged steadily over this period.

Some facets required an occasion to be unveiled, such as the enunciation of the SAGAR outlook during a prime ministerial visit to Mauritius in 2015. In other cases, the rationale followed the action such as the formalization of the Neighbourhood First policy some months after the 2014 swearing-in ceremony or, as was the case with ASEAN and beyond, additional layers had to be added for 'Look East' to become 'Act East'.

But there were also stark strategic decisions, such as the commitment to propagate the message of Indo-Pacific. Sometimes, particular events were devised to make a new move, such as the Forum for Indiaâ€“Pacific Islands Cooperation (FIPIC) summits. On occasion, certain circumstances brought out latent thinking, a good example being the Voice of Global South Summit in the aftermath of Covid and Ukraine. As we near the end of a decade, the overall strategy is obviously very much clearer than it was at the beginning. The dots have joined into lines, even forming concentric circles of interest.

What then is the *mandala* that captures India's thinking of the world today? At its core is obviously the immediate neighbourhood, the objects of attention at Modi's oath-taking ceremony in 2014. The approach here is to begin by recognizing that India occupies a unique position in the Subcontinent by virtue of its size, location and, increasingly, economic weight. It is obviously in India's interest that its immediate periphery be stable, secure and sensitive. Ensuring this in a competitive world will require us to underwrite the larger region and invest in the connectivity, cooperation and contacts that make for a more cohesive geography. There are challenges from both history, sociology and economics to overcome in this pursuit. While they need to be managed, the heart of the Neighbourhood First policy is for India to convince its immediate neighbours of the benefits of closer ties and then proceed to make that happen on the ground. This is essentially what we have seen unfold since 2014.

Today, we are looking at a distinctly different picture, where trans-border transmission grids, fuel pipelines, roads, railways and waterways, and smooth border crossing have become the hallmark of our times. All this is underpinned by the usage of each other's capabilities, be it in goods movement, ports or power generation. It has allowed the entire region to benefit through larger scale and greater efficiency. The real test of Neighbourhood First came in Sri Lanka's economic crisis and India's expeditious response has done much to enhance the credibility of its stance.

The second circle of priority is the extended neighbourhood. In every direction, the Modi government has, by now, laid out an intricate plan of engagement. In the case of ASEAN and Pacific nations, the upgradation of cooperation is expressed in domains like security, development and digital. As a result, the Act East Policy not only deepens India's presence in Southeast Asia but also positions it as a launching pad to the Pacific region and beyond.

Towards the Gulf, the 'Link West' approach has seen an unprecedented intensification of activities in a range of areas. Ties with the UAE, in particular, have helped to accelerate the pace of progress. Obviously, India only stands to benefit as others seek to compete. From the days when our vision of the Gulf was limited to energy and labour, this now extends to technology, education, innovation, investment and security. Even traditional areas like energy have witnessed broader Indian participation. Not least, the Gulf also serves as a bridgehead for greater involvement with Africa.

To the south, the SAGAR outlook brings together our maritime neighbours in an integrated manner. Some countries like Sri Lanka and the Maldives overlap with the Neighbourhood First policy. But others today note the stronger focus and larger resources that India is prepared to devote. Our development partnership with Mauritius has emerged as an exemplar in this context. The underlying maritime cooperation has also become the basis for an emerging security conclave that encourages more cooperative thinking.

To the north, Connect Central Asia Policy is the last piece of the puzzle which forges more systemic linkages with culturally comfortable partners. The agenda here is much more about connectivity, de-radicalization and development. For many of these states, India offers options that strengthen their overall positioning.

Clearly, how smoothly India advances in its multiple quests depends on the nature of its ties with major powers. In certain cases, Europe being one, constituent segments of a collective also need to be engaged individually. Many of them have the ability to facilitate this process; some have the ability to obstruct as well. It is naturally our endeavour to continually create an optimal mix. And this cannot be done by always staying the middle course or ducking the difficult problems. Obviously, there is a strong case for both prudence and perseverance. But there is an even more powerful one for understanding which relationship serves our interest best on which issues. As a result, contemporary diplomacy looks far from linear, often ending up in apparent zigzags. But the real test of its effectiveness is whether it puts India ahead in the competitive game. And such periodic assessments, therefore, assume importance in both policy validation and course correction, where required.

An essential part of preparing for a global footprint is to expand the breadth of interactions. The truth is that a very large number of nations have been engaged very perfunctorily by India for many years now. Even today, there are countries that are receiving an Indian foreign minister for the first time in their history. Realizing this, our efforts in the last decade have been to find more efficient ways of conducting global diplomacy.

A vigorous participation in existing mechanisms and the invention of new ones helps to address this challenge. The Quad and FIPIC in the Indo-Pacific, the I2U2 in West Asia, and the Indiaâ€“Nordic Summit in Europe are relevant examples at the highest level. The IMEC is the latest in the list. Those with ASEAN, the EU, Africa and BRICS have, of course, continued apace. But

these are now also supplemented at ministerial levels by formats with Central Europe, Caribbean and Central America. As with Europe and the rest of Asia, we can relate more purposefully to broader geographies like Africa and Latin America by dealing with sub-regions. The opening of new embassies, especially in Africa, is part of the same endeavour.

An important source of strength is the growth in investments, trade and projects of Indian businesses abroad. India is today among the top five economic partners of many countries of Africa and Latin America. The movement of our professionals is adding an additional layer to many relationships. Similarly, development projects supported through grants and soft loans across 78 nations of the Global South demonstrate capability as much as a solution to a local need. Quite apart from our national branding, it is the presence on the ground in so many manifestations that is imprinting India in the mind space of societies even far away.

The spatial *mandala* is accompanied by a conceptual one. Indian foreign policy today recognizes more explicitly the imperatives of national security in setting priorities and making choices. But security itself is perceived in much broader and deeper terms. AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India are neither economic protectionism nor political slogans. They are, in fact, a quest to build deeper strengths and greater strategic autonomy that is required by a nation aspiring to be a leading power. Increasingly, economic security also cohabits with technological security.

The digital domain is its most visible expression, though obviously far from being the only one. India's goal is not of moving the needle in the direction of autarky but, instead, to create the capabilities that would make it a serious player at a global level. The demand for resilient and reliable supply chains are a chance that could be exploited with the right policies. Similarly, the knowledge economy is its big opportunity, and transparent and trusted data flows assign a value to India that must be fully appreciated. Participating more intensively in the global economy will not just require better preparations and the right outlook but also the appropriate human resources.

Investing in skilling them for contemporary times is now being paralleled by endeavours to promote Indian talent through start-ups and innovation. These are not just economic or even social initiatives but strategic steps laden with deep meaning for international relations. Let us not forget that one important driver of the transformed Indiaâ€“US relationship was the H1B visa

flow. Addressing the rising aspirations of people at home and realizing ambitions abroad are but two sides of the same coin.

#### **THE INDIA STORY**

While the manner of engaging the world may be more considered, its effectiveness will really be judged by how the world views us now. It is, therefore, worthwhile to reflect on the changing external perceptions of India. Much of this centres on the nation's economic and technological progress. We were seen as the global back office for many years, but India has now surged well past that limited image. The knowledge economy has increasingly made us the crucial technology partner for many economies. The talk has now shifted to collaboration in complex fields like defence manufacturing and semiconductors. Our infrastructure improvements, coupled with making it easier to do business, have propelled us to become the largest destination for foreign direct investment (FDI). The Covid experience established us as the pharmacy of the world. That India handled the Covid well is widely recognized, but it is the economic bounce-back that is seen as the more consequential happening.

A lot of the India story discussed abroad revolves around improved governance. A digital delivery on such an enormous scale has been a particular source of fascination. Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) front magnifies the sense of a society on the move. The mosaic is made up of many granules, from vaccines and health industry to 5G stack and space launches, or indeed, to educational branding or Make in India outcomes. The G20 presidency has also served to acquaint a wide crosssection of policymakers and influencers with infrastructure improvement and governance progress. This emphasis on delivery has led to more effective implementation of project commitments abroad. That great care is taken to synchronize budgeting is only proof again of how much diplomacy is an art of the detail. A successful diaspora certainly adds to this positive view.

There are also leadership factors and decision-making record in play. To begin with, a sharper strategic clarity has enabled India to prioritize and plan better. A relevant example is of Neighbourhood First and the seriousness with which it is implemented on the ground. Another is about overcoming hesitations of history with the US in particular and the West in general. Here, too, India has not let changes in Administration deflect it from pursuing its

goals. At the same time, it has ensured that other balances are maintained to make this a smooth exercise.

Strategic clarity has also been accompanied by strategic communication. India's interests and intentions have been steadily messaged in appropriate forums and adjusted to changing circumstances. It could be about the Indo-Pacific, critical technologies, Covid-related needs or the Ukraine conflict. Partners are neither confused about our thinking nor doubtful of our intentions. A strongly independent stance has also helped India to effectively navigate a more multipolar and fractured world.

There is also a conscious endeavour to shape global issues, such as climate action, the pandemic, terrorism and digital infrastructure, and unleash the full power of ideas, be it in solar energy, disaster resilience, sustainable lifestyle, food security or even wellness. This has been backed up by projecting Indian traditions, history and culture more visibly on the global stage.

New India may be a message at home; it is equally an image abroad. It is not simply a more powerful and capable India that the world perceives; it is a more authentic and participative one, at ease as much with its nationalist spirit as with its international contributions.

The resulting interest in engaging India is today visible in many quarters. When it comes to matters of technology and economy, there is a growing perception of our relevance to the challenge of trusted manufacturing. This is all the more so since those processes have become so intensively data driven. One aspect of it is the reliability that emanates from our political and social characteristics. After all, it is evident that we are a political democracy, pluralistic society and market economy.

Increasingly, the misalignment of global demography and demand is making our human resources valuable for the international economy in a more tech-driven era. The establishment of the Trade and Technology Council with the EU is an indicator of the direction in which the winds are blowing. There has been even more marked progress with the US on this front, as indeed with the other two Quad partners.

A different dimension is the contribution we can make to the stability and security of the global commons, especially in the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, India is a partner of value in forums like BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Our independent stance always leaves open participation in any endeavour at conflict mitigation or resolution. The

combination of Covid support, digital delivery and development projects has also created a deeper constituency in the Global South. It is not lost on the developing world that we commenced our G20 presidency with the Voice of the Global South Summit. Nor, for that matter, that we championed the membership of the AU in the G20.

The last decade has also established convincingly that Indian development initiatives are truly demand-driven and do not conceal a hidden agenda. Certainly, India's ability to straddle the big fissures that global politics is currently grappling with is part of its overall standing in the world.

### **DECODING MODI-ERA DIPLOMACY**

We have till now focussed on how India has dealt with the world differently and the extent to which this, in turn, has shaped global views about India. Our appreciation, however, would be incomplete if we do not give adequate attention to the change in the very understanding of what foreign policy is all about. It may look as a shift in emphasis but is very much more than that.

Foreign policy is now seen as a direct instrument to accelerate national development and modernization. The flow of technology, capital and best practices are the ensuing focal points. Wooing the world is expressed in encouraging investors, especially by making it easier to do business. Interactions with them are as frequent as those with technology-providers and high achievers in different domains. AatmaNirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and Make in India provide an overall framework that facilitate such exercises, supported by initiatives like Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) on manufacturing or Gati Shakti in infrastructure.

The quest for technology and best practices is even visible in the PM's itinerary abroad, whether it related to a battery storage facility in the US, river cleaning in South Korea, bullet trains in Japan, skill development in Singapore, or railway stations in Germany. As this mindset was applied outwards, it also witnessed the export of projects, products and services that spoke of India's improved abilities. This includes a range of infrastructure, connectivity and public facilities that extend from South Asia to Africa and Latin America and, not least, a steady increase in defence exports to a growing list of nations.

The aggregate result is a developing perception of India as a partner of growing consequence. This has helped exports and market access abroad, with beneficial consequences at home. When a PM personally engages with all his ambassadors in that regard, we really know that India is changing.

In many ways, the operational culture of foreign-policy decision-making has adjusted to the new era. Central to that endeavour is a conscious effort to overcome silos by tighter coordination, more intensive strategizing and stronger feedback. Whether it is global trade negotiations, national security situations or multilateral concerns of development, the emphasis is on collective deliberations and decision-making. Starting as it does from ministers and secretaries, this has had a natural impact on the bureaucracy at large.

The same outlook is also demonstrated in respect of important partners and key issues. We see this now in respect of a multi-ministerial interaction with Singapore, the Trade and Technology Council format with the EU and the 2+2 Ministerial Dialogues in Defence and External Affairs with key nations. Behind that process was also a deliberative exercise that sought to prioritize, maximize and intensify India's international relationships. It could be the attention given to leadership-level exchanges, including to the chief guest for the Republic Day, and how they fit in with the larger game plan. Where feedback was concerned, the national-level Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI) exercise was customized for the objectives of foreign policy. Drilling deep down to specifics enabled delays, roadblocks and policy obstacles to be identified and addressed. As a result, many development projects abroad began witnessing more efficient execution.

The systemic improvements came into full play during Covid, whether it was in the Vande Bharat Mission or the Vaccine Maitri initiative. They were demonstrated during evacuation exercises as well, ranging from Yemen and Nepal to Afghanistan, Ukraine and Sudan.

From 2014, there has also been a strong conviction that India should be more active in shaping the global agenda. Obviously, some issues of particular priority for India itself, like terrorism and tax evasion, did not get the attention they deserved in the councils of the world. There were others like maritime security on which India could make a crucial contribution. In due course, when an important debate like the one on connectivity unfolded, the strong confidence level of the Modi government allowed it to take the

lead. When it came to climate challenges, India, till 2014, was widely perceived as a reluctant participant. Since then, it has emerged as a credible champion of both climate action and climate justice by becoming an exemplar on renewables and advocate of resourcing.

There was also a belief that we were mostly responding to the initiatives of others rather than putting forward our own thinking. However, whether it was at the UN, G20 Summits or COP meetings, the flow of ideas turned into more structured proposals, like the ISA and the CDRI. The creativity continues, recent examples being One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG), Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) and the International Year of Millets (2023). To take the agenda forward, there was an openness to explore new partners and collaborations where required. The Quad, the I2U2 and the SCO are relevant examples. As confidence grew in our ability to contribute to global solutions, it took diverse forms, a collective one like the development agenda for Africa as well as a unilateral one like the Vaccine Maitri. By dint of application and imagination, the early thoughts about making our presence felt more strongly have now become reality.

While addressing practical challenges to India's progress, much thought has also been given to branding India in a manner reflecting the rise of a civilizational state. The truth is that two centuries of colonialism had skewed the global discourse so drastically in favour of the West that the heritage, culture and traditions of the rest of the world were relegated to the sidelines. Part of the responsibility for that predicament also rests with the leadership of developing societies. They subscribed to equating modernity and advancement with emulating the West. For reasons both ideological and political, many of them often ran down their own past.

As a result, the imperative for cultural rebalancing to accompany its economic and political facets has only grown with times. Prime Minister Modi has led from the front in this regard. His initiative in 2015 to globally celebrate yoga has been phenomenally successful. The propagation of our medical and wellness practices has also gained traction. When it comes to environment, the advocacy of lifestyle changes is being widely welcomed. Even food habits are relevant in this regard, reflected in the Indian endeavour to lead greater cultivation and consumption of millets, our ancient grains. Some of this is expressed through the optics of how the leadership carries itself and expresses its views.

A large part of the challenge that still needs more effective redressal is in the deeper concepts and entrenched assumptions of contemporary international relations. That is still work in progress but hopefully one that will see improvements in the coming years.

Yet another notable feature of the Modi-era diplomacy has been its people-centric approach. There were multiple drivers for this greater emphasis on the human factor. One, of course, was the external reflection of a domestic campaign to improve development indices and extend social welfare. Supporting Indians abroad is a natural extrapolation of this approach.

Another is the understanding that India needed to prepare for the requirements of the knowledge economy. It was essential to envisage a global workplace, not just a trading place. And that meant working out the requisite institutional arrangements and practices rather than leaving our citizens at the mercy of the vagaries of the mobility industry.

Then, there was greater consciousness about the importance and contribution of Indians abroad, be they students, professionals or those more settled. Their welfare was envisaged as an obligation that should be addressed with utmost seriousness. And finally, there was a sense of a changing India itself. A rising power should not leave its people abroad to face adversity on their own. Such detachment not only reflects badly on our standing but could also undermine the faith with which Indians could proceed abroad.

Instituting robust welfare measures applicable beyond our borders, extricating our citizens from crisis situations and organizing repatriations as they happened during the Covid pandemic are all steps in that direction. Indeed, the transformation begins right at home with radical reforms in the ease of issuing passports. This was paralleled by initiatives to facilitate mobility while ensuring that Indians were not treated in a discriminatory manner. Concluding Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements (MMPAs) with countries ranging from Australia to Germany are the policy reflections of this concern.

### **DELIVERING ON PARTNERSHIPS**

The progress report of the last decade is an encouraging one. Stronger expressions of diplomatic energies and activities have clearly raised India's

profile in global councils. Prime Minister Modi, in particular, is perceived as a global figure who, while advancing his national interest, has a broader vision and a commitment to collective good. When it comes to the complex challenges that inevitably arise in world affairs, India is no longer seen as ducking the tough decisions.

The regional perception in the Subcontinent started to change from 2014. Understandably, this has not been a linear path, but overall, there is appreciation for the enormous strides that connectivity, cooperation and contacts have made. The extended neighbourhood also appreciates India's stronger sense of purpose as well as high-level visits happening after such long gaps. Where the major powers are concerned, they, too, have seen India prepared to engage more confidently and independently, perhaps in its engagement with multiple partners on defence, technology and energy or, indeed, standing its ground firmly when it comes to protecting its national interests from external pressures.

There is a global dimension to India's progress, which is no less important. In myriad ways, we have been active on a range of international issues that actually shape our contemporary era. Whether it is debt relief, global minimum tax or fairer market access, India has been a powerful voice in global conversations. When it comes to terrorism, India's own counteractions and collaboration in restricting terror financing and listing of sanctioned terrorists have contributed to greater international awareness. We not only took the debate on maritime security to the UNSC but are participating in concrete initiatives across the Indo-Pacific, including hosting a key fusion centre.

One subject on which India made a decisive difference was connectivity. By taking a comprehensive and clear-cut view of the principles underpinning it, its policymakers were able to shape the debate in favour of greater transparency and better viability. But what has affected global perception most profoundly has been the Indian stance during the Covid pandemic. By providing vaccines to a 100 partners and medicines and materials to 150 nations, India demonstrated an altogether different level of global responsibility. The accrued goodwill has clearly helped define its profile at a time when the world is in transition.

In international cooperation, a lot depends on the willingness to walk the talk. For decades, we were known for partnering with other nations in their development efforts, mostly through training and exchanges but also, on

occasion, through projects. In the last decade, this development has been significantly scaled up. There has been a visible expansion in lines of credit, grant assistance, capability building, infrastructure and economic projects as well as human resources enhancement.

But more than this scale, what has really changed is the effectiveness of delivery. Monitored continuously and supervised strongly, long-pending projects were brought to successful conclusion and new ones undertaken with greater professionalism. Connectivity, socio-economic facilities, logistics and energy in our immediate neighbourhood have been particular beneficiaries. Post-earthquake projects in Nepal and infrastructure in Mauritius are prominent examples of the enhanced quality of delivery. Despite the Covid challenges, India was also able to keep most of its commitments made to African nations as part of the India-Africa Forum Summit (IAFS).

During this period, the footprint of India's international partnerships has also expanded perceptibly. It now ranges from renewable energy in the Pacific to community projects in the Caribbean. It could be the refinery in Mongolia, the Metro Express in Mauritius, a textile factory in Kenya or water supply in Tanzania, many India-supported endeavours have been gamechangers for the partner countries.

A more vigorous India has been able to forge new relationships that recognize its growing value. An obvious example is the Quad, which has facilitated other Indo-Pacific engagements in domains like technology, supply chains, education, maritime security, etc. When it came to Eurasia, India's inclusion in the SCO in 2017 underlined its salience to that grouping's agenda. During this period, membership of export control regimes like Missile Technology Control Regime, Australia Group and Wassenaar Arrangement were as significant as plurilateral initiatives led by India, especially on sustainability. These memberships also spoke of a larger phenomenon of India's rise and the response of the world to it. That all 54 African states attended the IAFS Summit, that all 10 ASEAN leaders were present at the 2018 Republic Day and that India engaged 27 EU countries in Porto in 2021 and that 125 nations participated in the Voice of Global South Summit in 2023 are illustrations of where it stands today.

Often, that proposition is tested through elections to international organizations, and by and large, India has come through successfully. Indeed, the growing demand for our participation in different forums, engagement in various formats and presence on multiple occasions are reflective of our global stock.

#### **FINDING OUR OWN SOLUTIONS**

As we come out of Covid, like every other country, India is also assessing its costs, evaluating its experiences and drawing its lessons. What can be said with some degree of confidence is that we have weathered the storm better than many others. Strong fundamentals and considered policies ensure that India stays very much on course to becoming a leading power in the future. While much of that is dependent on continuously enhancing capabilities, it is equally essential that India's vision of its prospects remain confident. After all, we have struggled with decades of downsizing, hyphenation, noninvolvement and risk aversion.

The pathway for the future is built on a mindset of fierce independence, though the challenge is to refresh it for contemporary times. Our ability to express this outlook has naturally changed with our strengths. Today, we have many more resources and instruments at our command to achieve national goals abroad. But even capabilities and aspirations produce results only when filtered through an accurate understanding of the world in which we live.

A crucial aspect of diplomacy, therefore, is a comprehensive landscape analysis, which captures the contradictions and nuances so essential to make policy choices. At the highest level, it centres on multipolarity and rebalancing while taking into account the contradictions between major nations. Drilling down region by region has meant a more granular appreciation of the issues involved. In all of this, there is the overarching reality of globalization, the ideologies of which can often mislead us through simplistic propositions. As we are increasingly discovering, one truth mainly works for one street.

The quest to develop capacities clearly benefits from domestic reform and modernization initiatives. This linkage was dumbed down to the assertion that 8 per cent growth was the best foreign policy! The reality, however, is that growth gained without transforming the foundations and framework had in-built limitations. This decade has consequently been a much more comprehensive effort that departed from established mantras. It also sought to avoid the pitfalls that were presented by a less strategic

understanding of globalization. India's decision not to accede to the RCEP agreement in 2019 was significant in that respect. One important indication of the changed approach was in its very conceptualization. For the first time, Indian policymakers started framing the rise of India in terms of an era that is called the *Amrit Kaal*. By doing so, they articulate a thinking that is more long-term, comprehensive and transformational. And the fact is that the achievements of the last decade justify such a view point.

There is no shortage of indices that would point to the progress of recent years. And these do not in any way deny the magnitude of challenges that still confront India. But among them, perhaps it is worth focussing on those that are directly relevant to India's rise in the international system. A starting point is the steep decline in poverty, notable not only because it is among the more extreme problems facing India but also as it represents a wider drag on society. Equally important is the Indian middle class, which is expected to double during the *Amrit Kaal*, that is, by 2047. The world is surely assessing these developments, both from contribution and consumption perspectives. As it studies the quality of India's human resources, it would also note major expansion of universities, medical and nursing colleges and engineering and technical skills. Indeed, there is a change underway in the approaches to education and skill development that are designed to make them more worldfriendly. The transformation in infrastructure is also underway, reflected in expansion of highways, railways, airports and digital networks. India is no longer seen as just limited to services. Even at home, energetic digital delivery has revolutionized governance and helped prepare the ground for deeper participation in a range of domains.

By raising the definition of basic amenities and, more importantly, delivering on them, India is rapidly changing the quality of life of one-sixth of the world. Depending on the country concerned, it is perceived by them as an innovator, producer, contributor or exemplar. Each one of these attributes make it a more attractive partner in international relations.

Developing the boldness and fortitude to advance one's prospects is almost as hard as growing actual capabilities. Learning to compete at increasingly higher levels does require confident leadership and systemic changes. As stakes get higher, it is also necessary to outthink competitors and outlast mindgames. Each phase in a power's rise has different benchmarks and changing peer groups. Adjusting our ambitions and calculations constantly will never be easy. In India's case, we have steadily outgrown the

hyphenation with Pakistan and are being increasingly perceived as sui generis.

A part of the challenge is also to strike the right understandings on the optimal terms with the most appropriate partners. How to get the give-andtake right is crucial. These could be in a field of commerce and investment or indeed in domains like technology and connectivity. There are always opportunities to leverage if a nation plays to its strengths. Similarly, it has additional possibilities that could emerge from global demands of reliable supply, trusted data or critical technologies.

That said, we cannot be oblivious either to structural obstacles created by a world order devised more than 75 years ago. The heart of the matter is that in those crucial years, India was either present nominally on the high table or not there at all. Especially because of what happened to it in 1947, India consequently operates in a world where the dice is often loaded against it. Indeed, its rise in the last seven decades is really a story of changing the terms of engagement with the world, many of which were particularly adverse when it started this journey.

The problem is not one that can be quantified economically; it is even more that of assumptions and narratives. The world order consists of institutions and practices that are often closely interlocked. They determine what is politically correct and what is not. And because its key players have not only built an architecture to serve their purpose but still retain the influence to promote it, a power like India will have to swim upstream for a long time to come. Among the most formidable currents it has to navigate are the challenges emanating from 'freezing the moment'. This is a widely practised stratagem by hegemonic powers that seek to make permanent the advantageous elements of a landscape.

At its broadest level, this is visible in the manner in which the outcomes of 1945 are utilized to define an international hierarchy. The trick obviously is to imbue a particular moment with enormous significance and, thereafter, derive continuous benefit from it. Arguments to make the world more contemporary are rebutted by conflating them with challenging the original outcome in question. This, however, is but one example of the larger tussle to maintain or change the world as we know it today. There are many more, some limited in scope and others more sweeping. They help to create and maintain frameworks, operate and defend structures and, crucially, establish and advance narratives. And they succeed to a great degree because global

behaviour is shaped so much by muscle memory. We are all not just creatures of habits but followers of norms and believers of storylines.

A combination of these factors conceals the vested interests that underpin the arrangements of the day. It could be the UN and its working, nuclear nonproliferation, the selective focus on human rights, the equally calculated balancing of realpolitik and values, as well as the utilization of Cold War imagery. Particular moments also serve to define the 'other' sharply, such as after the 9/11 attack. So does the evocation of past conflicts, especially the last World War. For all these reasons, attempts to reshape global debates and concepts meet with the fiercest resistance. That is something India must expect and counter.

As a rising power, India encounters freezing the moment in different formats. It can come up against institutions and practices that do not give it its due. That is why it is such a strong proponent of reformed multilateralism. It can shape its approach to other powers, sometimes to our detriment. This requires confident thinking to create more up-to-date terms of engagement. On occasion, impactful moments can lead to such strong perceptions that it puts pressure on policy to adjust. To a considerable degree, that is the case with Pakistan after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack. The Indian public clearly saw the governmental response as weak-kneed and pushed for a change.

There could even be situations when we will want to move on rapidly beyond an action. That was certainly the case of the Vajpayee government in reaching out to key partners soon after the 1998 nuclear tests. It is sometimes the fate of nations to also inherit the concepts and assumptions of others. The global understanding of India's place and influence is a relevant example, one very much shaped by other powers. It is only in recent years that we have managed to break out, first of the post-Partition hyphenation and then from the Indian Ocean box. The reaction to an Indo-Pacific presence is, therefore, only to be expected. One facet of a transformational decade has been to overcome this natural inclination to be a prisoner of our own history.

The difficulties of the past need not always be an encumbrance. The creativity of political leaderships is sometimes demonstrated by an ability to make it an asset in a changed context. In recent years, our nation has seen a renewed interest in Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army, as well as in those who resisted British colonialism in an earlier era. The great tribal leader Birsa Munda and the revolutionary Alluri Sitarama Raju are two such cases. While such figures may not have been entirely

successful in achieving their immediate objectives, their longer-term impact as inspirational icons is very apparent today. Imageries from history are, in fact, extremely powerful in articulating aspirations for the future.

Indeed, when we look back at our own record over the last seven decades, it is still specific events like the conflicts of 1962, 1965, 1971 and 1999 that stand out as milestones. As India goes about its endeavour to ascend the international hierarchy, it must play well this game of using narratives and experiences to establish practices and habits as well.

The messaging out of New Delhi has also been far more energetic on key issues. *Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam* (the world is one family) conveys a commitment to international cooperation; 'Reformed Multilateralism' underlines the urgency of addressing the effectiveness of the UN; 'A World Free of Terror' underlines a determination to combat this long-standing threat; 'Digital for Development' speaks of how effective it has been as a governance tool; 'Mother of Democracy' is a reminder that our pluralistic and consultative traditions go back deep in history; and 'One World One Health' is an assertion of the need for timely, effective and nondiscriminatory responses to global health challenges.

Developing our own lexicon, concepts, mechanisms and ideas and socializing them in world politics is also a testimony to India's continued rise. Their unfolding underlines the reality of India's vigorous participation in global platforms.

Within India, there will always be lively arguments about the balance between continuity and change in our foreign policy. That is only to be expected and, perhaps, in some ways, is even contributory to the emergence of new ideas. Normally, when it comes to diplomacy, analysis focusses on how we see the world and all its complications. Sometimes, it is useful to invert that and reflect on how the world, on its part, could be visualizing India and the opportunities there.

India's rise is a relentless exercise where the sensible only pause to take stock, never to declare victory. Without neglecting the past, it works best when our eyes are fixed firmly on the horizons and we read the international situation right as well as fashion our strategies and tactics accordingly. But to do all this and more, it is essential that Bharat is true to itself, its interests and its ambitions.
