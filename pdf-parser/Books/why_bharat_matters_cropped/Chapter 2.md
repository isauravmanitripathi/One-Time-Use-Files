# FOREIGN POLICY AND YOU

## Making a Difference in Your Daily Life

ndia may matter to the world and vice versa. But that does not mean we Indians should not watch out for ourselves. From that national perspective, what is a 'good' foreign policy? Perhaps we overcomplicate the answer by confusing sensible pursuit of interests with complicated formulations. So, it is important to look beyond the terminology and validate it through gut answers.

A 'good' foreign policy must work for you personally. Your everyday needs from the world must be better met. Since we are a collective as a country, our national security must be ensured. As that is done, the pursuit of our aspirations must be facilitated. Foreign policy, being the link to the outside, should enable us to draw what we seek. It could be technology, capital, best practices or work opportunities. And obviously, we would all like to be strong, look good and feel appreciated.

In the final analysis, good foreign policy must read global trends well and anticipate what portends for our nation and our people. When the unexpected happens, it must respond nimbly and effectively. At the same time, it must message our intentions and project our image positively. Any effort that ensures these goals has a lot going for it. It does not necessarily need to sound nice; it must simply pass the smell test.

Put yourself in the shoes of an Indian student who happened to be in Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Focussed on educational prospects, you are now caught in the middle of a serious conflict. It is not just you and thousands more of your fellow nationals, there are millions of Ukrainians who are trying to get out of the country at the same time. Internal travel is dangerous and complicated. The borders are even more so due to overcrowding and congestion. In the conflict-impacted cities, there is even fear regarding the physical danger of stepping out in the open due to shelling and air strikes.

This is when you really look to your government for support and extrication. And indeed, this is when its entire foreign policy apparatus swings into action as it did through Operation Ganga. It did so by facilitating transport, including trains and buses. It intervened at the highest levels in Russia and Ukraine to ensure ceasing of fire for safe passage. It engaged the border authorities to enable border crossing. And in extreme cases, such as in the city of Sumy, its representatives even traversed conflict zones to ensure the necessary logistics for your safety. Once you were out of Ukraine, it worked with neighbouring governments in Romania, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to establish transit camps, utilize air fields and organize the flights required for a return home. Reflect for a moment on the efforts, interventions and relationships at various levels, starting from the very top, that were involved to make all of this happen.

Revisit then Kabul on 15 August 2021. Imagine that, for whatever reason, you found yourself stranded when the Taliban suddenly took over the city. Apart from navigating a city now controlled by Taliban checkpoints, you could well ask how difficult going home could be. Well, a great effort had to be made by the Indian government. It was as challenging as combining access to a secured American airbase that was on edge, surrounded by desperate Afghans and suspicious Taliban; using Tajik rear support for quick response; accessing Iranian airspace at short notice; and quietly utilizing Gulf facilitation! Some others were beneficiaries of seats in flights run by the United States of America (US), the United Kingdom (UK), the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and France that were delicately negotiated. This might seem like exceptionally complicated logistics. But it was more than that: behind it were years of relationships that really delivered at a time of need. Equally important is that this represented the efficacy of a flexible and pragmatic Indian policy of multiple engagements.

The Operation Devi Shakti flights from Kabul may have been extraordinarily stressful, but they were still manageable at short notice. In terms of numbers involved, India's response to the demands generated by the Covid pandemic was much bigger. The Vande Bharat Mission, which brought back millions of Indians from multiple countries by air, sea and land, is perhaps the largest recorded evacuation exercise in history. The movement of people was only the tip of the iceberg. Driving it was a complex and intricate set of activities that included organizing, gathering, testing, housing and even feeding those waiting to be repatriated.

Starting first at Wuhan and then moving on to Italy and beyond, this involved an intensive engagement with local, provincial and national authorities. And it covered everybody, from tourists and students to professionals and workers, even pilgrims, fishermen and seafarers. It was not limited to Indians coming back. Many staying abroad, in the Gulf, for instance, were given support directly or by interceding with local governments. Here, too, the results of cultivation by political leaders and diplomats paid off.

A more recent example was that of the Indian community caught up in armed civil strife in Sudan in April 2023. Tensions may have been steadily building up over the past year, but nevertheless, expatriates are usually reluctant to leave until the worst case actually happens. In this instance, when it suddenly did, it put almost 4,000 Indian nationals in jeopardy. Overnight, the Indian response mobilized by setting up the command centre at home for what came to be named as Operation Kaveri. At the same time, Indian aircraft were positioned in Saudi Arabia for short-notice flights, while Indian naval vessels were sent to the Red Sea. The extrication process was again incredibly complicated because our nationals were dispersed in small numbers across a vast area. In the civil war situation, law and order broke down completely and even basic necessities became difficult to access. The Indian Embassy worked under the most challenging circumstances, including the occupation of its premises by a warring party. The solution was to evacuate as safely, inconspicuously and rapidly as possible, three objectives that often collided especially in the face of personal and political pressures.

Yet, it was an operation that delivered fully because it was a combination of a committed official presence on the ground, adept diplomacy with neighbours and enablers and a detailed SOP that had been honed over years. Our diplomats and military personnel performed outstandingly, often taking high personal risks. We saw partners like the Saudis, the British and the Egyptians go out of their way to help as well. If there is a common thread among these stressful experiences, it is that of larger dangers that impact individual lives. And that is, in fact, a predicament all through human history.

When a sage first took Rama and Lakshmana to cleanse his hermitage of evil demons, little did they realize what that encounter presaged for their lives. It was their first brush with the forces of darkness, whose full powers they were far from grasping. Indeed, the very Maricha whom Lord Rama first neutralized came back in the form of a golden deer to deceive him in his later exile. Years later, in the initial phase of his banishment, he again pledged to protect the sages of Sharabhanga, perhaps unknowing of where this was to lead him.

There are so many instances of the future being decided by the juxtaposition of complicated events, be that the fate of the monkey-king Vali or the eagle-king Jatayu. A few like Maricha sense it but are still powerless to halt the course of destiny. In fact, the triggering event of King Dasaratha's boons is an example of an unintended decision leading to unanticipated consequences. This is also illustrated by the fact that Ravana does not even imagine the ultimate results of his abduction of Queen Sita.

In our modern world, we, too, live with uncertainties and turbulence. No amount of anticipation can prepare us fully. Yet, we must always assess, plan and be ready to respond. A sensible government, which has the welfare of its citizens at the centre of its thinking, will naturally put in place rules, regulations, mechanisms and practices for unforeseen contingencies. It would also constantly refine them based on experiences. That is exactly what has changed in the last decade, and if we look back, it is visible how much of a difference that has made to our common citizens.

#### **DEALING WITH A GLOBALIZED EXISTENCE**

A parallel example in public health during the same period is equally instructive. When the first wave of Covid hit India in 2020, we scrambled across the world to procure personal protective equipment (PPE), masks and ventilators and did so in a seller's market as the demand far exceeded supply. Ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry with escalating requirements were also greatly sought after. Even the inputs for vaccines came from tens of companies spread out in multiple nations, and they were subject to the primacy of local demands. Commerce by itself was not adequate in such circumstances; contacts were needed for effective access and regulatory approvals. The second wave in 2021 saw a similar spike in demand for oxygen and specialized medicines from abroad. Locating, negotiating and contracting supplies became the priority of Indian diplomacy. And it really bent its back to deliver. These examples may be the products of extraordinary situations, but they do illustrate what is an undeniable reality. And it is that our daily life is increasingly influenced by what happens elsewhere, be they problems or solutions.

So, the next time you are watching a foreign visit, hearing a discussion on an important relationship or reading a debate about interests abroad, take it very seriously. Remember that this may have a direct bearing on your wellbeing. Foreign policy matters not just in distress situations. It could literally determine your security, your job, the quality of your life and, as we discovered recently, even your health. It shapes what you hold dear: pride, values, reputation and image. For all these reasons and more, it is important that you take a greater interest in the world and understand what that could mean for your prospects.

Let us explore what foreign policy could mean for you personally. If you are an Indian student, it may be the ease of getting a visa, the ability to travel during times of Covid and perhaps employment after studies. If you are a businessperson, it could help you get access to foreign markets, receive information on regulations and practices, and, where circumstances demand, obtain assistance to solve problems. For professionals and workers, this may be visible in ensuring fair employment contracts, a stronger sense of protection and welfare measures in times of difficulties. For a stranded tourist, a sympathetic embassy provides much-needed succour and support and, in more threatening circumstances, even evacuation.

But you do not have to be abroad to need foreign policy; it matters at home just as much. When it comes to security, external or internal, diplomacy could be a preventive measure, a mitigator or a problem solver. It can help raise awareness of a shared threat just as it can find partners against common dangers. So, if you are a soldier guarding our frontiers or a policeman grappling with terrorism, a good foreign policy makes your life a little easier. And then there is the economy, with its search for investment, technology and best practices, which can be enabled only by foreign policy.

In each of these sectors, foreign relationships can accelerate India's progress. Cumulatively, what they do is expand employment and improve your quality of life. Whether it is the price of cooking oil that is imported or a smartphone produced collaboratively, a larger policy decision has just made some difference to your purse. Indeed, if there were any doubts at all on that score, the pressures and responses coming in the wake of the Ukraine conflict have set it to rest.

But also reflect for a moment how much the big issues of our times, pandemic, terrorism and climate change, impact your very existence. Ask yourself whether we should not have a greater say in the search for solutions.

It also matters to all of us what other nations think of India, our culture and our way of life. After all, the G20 presidency offers a unique chance to make the world more conversant with India and our own people more ready to explore opportunities abroad. Should we not then shape our image and influence the narrative? At the same time, the challenge is to do so without opening a way for external forces to interfere in our national debates and development. These are but a sample of how, in an increasingly connected world, the attitude, perceptions and interests of others are so relevant. If they have to be managed and leveraged, then it is all the more necessary for a sharper realization at home that foreign policy really matters.

## **DIPLOMACY AND NATIONAL SECURITY**

For all societies, security ranks foremost in their priorities. The reason is obvious: it affects the very nature of our collective. This has a territorial aspect as well as that of safety, law and order and well-being. They are often connected because together, they determine the national spirit and existence. India faces more than its fair share of external challenges, in part because many of our boundaries have not been fully settled. The resulting contestations are obviously a call on both determination and resources. We saw that earlier with Pakistan and more recently with China. But they demand equally that energies be focussed on ensuring optimal positions, on the ground as much as in negotiations. Given the serious repercussions of such differences, it is also very relevant to ensuring peace and tranquillity, if not more.

Diplomacy is a natural partner of defence. Most of the time, it is the first line; on occasion, it is also the back-up. After all, most military situations do end up at the conference table! Indeed, the achievements of foreign policy in stabilizing the neighbourhood are very much the basis for progress and development at home.

With the world being what it is, self-interest and convergence cannot be fully counted upon to forecast the behaviour of others, including neighbours. Neither their ambitions and emotions nor their risk-taking propensity are always predictable. Few would have anticipated the sharpness of the downturn that India's relations with China have taken in the last three years. Any prudent polity, therefore, backs its posture with capabilities and deterrence.

A big responsibility of Indian diplomacy is to create the widest set of options for such contingencies. This could mean acquisition of defence equipment and other supportive measures; securing understanding for our policies and actions from the international community; and, for that matter, in mitigating or resolving more fraught situations. Let us look at how all of that has worked in the last few years.

A notable achievement of the Modi government was to conclude and implement the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh in 2015. In conjunction with the resolution of maritime differences, this has had a positive impact on the security situation in the East. More than that, it has opened up possibilities for economic cooperation and connectivity for the entire sub-region. The beneficiaries are not just India and Bangladesh with respect to trade and travel or Nepal and Bhutan for the same but the northeastern states of India as well, and that also to a very significant degree.

A very different challenge is being faced on our western boundary vis-àvis Pakistan. On that front, the initial goal of diplomacy was to expose and de-legitimize Pakistan's cross-border terrorism. When counter-actions were required, as in Uri in 2016 and Balakot in 2019, effective diplomacy ensured global understanding of India's actions.

As far as China is concerned, the diplomatic negotiations that are going on in parallel to the military stand-off since May 2020 illustrate that foreign and defence policies are really joined at the hip. Here, too, the value of global support and appreciation is self-evident. The leveraging of a multipolar world has been particularly visible in terms of weapons and technologies needed by our defence forces. That a Rafale aircraft acquisition from France can take place in the same timeframe as that of an MH-60 helicopter or P-8 aircraft from the US, the S-400 missile system from Russia and SPICE bombs from Israel speaks volumes of our nimbleness. These are typically accompanied by military exercises and policy exchanges that bring about greater strategic comfort. In short, diplomacy supports, empowers and facilitates the national security effort.

Some of this happens on the domestic side as well, even if it is less obvious. Peace at home has often been troubled by insurgent groups operating from the neighbourhood. Adept diplomacy, however, has effectively discouraged neighbours from providing shelter or support. From time to time, it has taken a little more than that to achieve results. That, too, has been persuasively justified.

Separatism, violence and fundamentalism have also been propagated from destinations afar, misusing the protections of free speech. Canada and the UK have both witnessed such happenings. These also require vigorous and continuous countering, since some see preaching violence against others not to be in discordance with democratic rights. Where arguments and persuasion yield little result, firmer diplomatic measures may also be required. Our overall posture does radiate the message that India will no longer be a punching bag in the politics of others.

Arguments must be met with reason, but polemics clearly demand a more vehement reply. Extremism and other challenges to governance that find encouragement from sympathizers, whether in the name of civil society or identity, need a robust response as well. A world of borderless politics also generates its own set of concerns that supplement traditions of influence operations. There are powerful forces with their distinct agenda that encourage the overriding of democratic choices. Their intolerance of anything different is manifested in attempts to delegitimize other points of view. Established newspapers giving UN-sanctioned figures access to their opinion page or eminent broadcasters doing political hatchet jobs are indicative of both a mindset and an objective. That there are many effective tools in play, including the power of technology and influence of civil society organizations, makes this challenge formidable. When it comes to politics, the battle of narratives is a perennial exercise. India has to patiently make the case that its pursuit of national interest is very much in tune with its advocacy of global good. A large part of the answers lies in the world of argumentation and in the effectiveness of communication. Diplomacy, thus, has a responsibility as both the shield and sword of a polity.

Recent global debates about India have implications for our security. As a federal polity of such extraordinary diversity, the quest to nurture the union should be most appreciated in our context. Yet, what we find is that efforts to strengthen national unity, sovereignty and integrity are often undermined by misrepresenting facts. Surprisingly, improvements in governance, applications of technology and progress on long-festering issues can be depicted as detrimental to freedom. Even prominent institutions indulge in disinformation in pursuit of a cause. History can be airbrushed and unfavourable events conveniently ignored. In our quest, we have discovered that political votebanks are a reality strongly beyond our shores as well.

Robustly defending the nation against such undermining is a commitment that must be recognized.

If this was just a debate, perhaps that would matter less. But it is a harsh reality at work. Some of it may be ideological, but there is also the competitive nature of international relations. Bluntly put, there have always been interests that militate against a strong and united India. In the past, they exploited every faultline that our society provided: religion, language, ethnicity and social strata. Today, in a different garb and with new arguments, they are even more active than before. Perhaps, more of us need to ask ourselves why separatism in India finds regular support in quarters abroad. For that matter, how terrorism directed at us is consistently underplayed or even rationalized. Indeed, why some foreign forums lend themselves so readily to the denigration of our record and achievements. The task of foreign policy, when confronted with such calculations and stratagems, is to push back strongly even while advancing our own narrative.

### **ACCELERATING NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT**

Since the drive for prosperity is a constant endeavour for all societies, it is natural that policymaking is also devoted to this goal. The most obvious expression of that is the promotion of trade and investments. Markets do not always work by themselves; in reality, pretty much everybody utilizes encouragement and facilitation. Those with historical handicaps have an even stronger reason to do so. We are still playing catch-up on industrialization, technology acquisition and competitiveness and will continue to do so for some time.

Just building capabilities at home, however, may not be adequate. Securing business abroad needs information, networking and access. There is a virtuous cycle at work here, whereby greater trade and economic activity strengthens skills, capabilities and employment at home. And that, in turn, constantly updates and tests our mettle. In many ways, foreign policy is an exercise in competitiveness and its economic facets a reflection in a particular domain.

In the last few years, India achieved ambitious export goals that would have been considered unrealistic till just recently. Now, this is not just a substantial increase in aspiration but one realized as the world economy is still recovering from the Covid pandemic. The basis for this confidence is a

range of reforms in manufacturing, labour, finance, skills and trade facilitation. Added to that is a steady improvement in the ease of doing business. Foreign commercial policy is being tasked to obtain access to markets and lower trade barriers. This can be done in an orthodox way but hastened through negotiated understandings, including free-trade agreements (FTAs) and global supply chains. That may be an objective in itself; its larger significance for employment and prosperity are obvious.

Increasingly, foreign policy contributes to the creation of new capacities at home. In Asia, all modernizing economies have single-mindedly focussed their external interactions on obtaining capital, technology and best practices from abroad. Japan was the pioneer in this regard during the Meiji era, and China, after Deng Xiaoping, was the most successful in terms of scale. In the last few years, India, too, has embraced this mindset. We have notable examples of benefits to people from endeavours at the enterprise level or in national projects. It may be information technology (IT) or auto manufacturing, food production or food processing, metros or bullet train, space capabilities or nuclear energy: the fruits of foreign collaboration are there for all to see.

Newer challenges like green growth and climate action have started to open up more possibilities. Our partners have expanded from the older industrialized economies to more innovative ones. All this happens because of our ability to identify, engage, negotiate and leverage opportunities of interest abroad across many domains. The most effective foreign policy is the one that focusses and delivers on development.

The resources and opportunities provided by external collaborations speed up the natural growth of the domestic economy. Valuable as they are, they do not, however, substitute the continuous nurturing of deep strengths at home. As we have discovered through experience, confusion on that score can have damaging consequences.

Three decades ago, India embarked on much needed reforms and opened up its economy. The benefits of doing so are undisputed. However, in the name of efficiency and modernity, easy options were taken at the expense of our small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Instead of building effective domestic supply chains, we opted for integration and value addition that were more profitable and less painstaking. Infrastructure projects were given out to others without any effort to absorb learnings for our own industry. The pursuit of short-term gains made us lose ambition and, with that, a sense of

strategy. As a result, economic growth did not witness the commensurate scaling up of skills, strengths and capacities.

In the last decade, we have awoken to the realization that mantras about globalization, if mindlessly applied, can cause real damage. Not just that, if economic choices are divorced from a strategic context, it could lead the country down a very dangerous path. The real debate is not whether we should be an open or a protected economy. It is whether we are an employment-centric and capability-driven one or just a profit-obsessed society content to be a market. Along with vulnerabilities, a dependent mindset has also been rationalized, which masquerades as globalized thinking. India's destiny is bigger than to be just a part of the future of others. Real growth is not only about GDP increase; it is equally about infrastructure, supply chains, skills, finance and socio-economic progress. When we sacrifice the latter for the former, our long-term prospects are imperilled. We could slide into strategic lock-ins without even being aware. Foreign policy is surely an instrument to advance our strategic course; it is equally an insurance that our big picture is the right one.

In an era of more interdependence and interpenetration, it is also expected that all nations will seek to expand their zones of deep influence beyond their national boundaries. In the past, trade, finance, military activities and migration were some of the means to do so. Nowadays, the role of connectivity and socio-economic collaboration has become more salient. This is an important realization for a nation like India, whose reach was constrained by Partition. As we grow in different dimensions, strategic sense dictates that our prosperity serves as a larger incentive for the entire region. Realizing this, the Modi government has significantly expanded connectivity and collaborative initiatives with neighbours. Its results are evident in new road and rail connections, waterways, port access and transit rights, power grids and fuel flows, and especially in the movement of people.

South Asia is undergoing a real transformation by encouraging win-win outcomes and buy-ins by partners. The Neighbourhood First outlook addresses this challenge in the immediate vicinity, just as parallel policies do in the extended neighbourhood. India's support to neighbours during the Covid period also reflected this very thinking.

Interdependence, however, has its own downside and can be leveraged unfairly when global norms are cast aside. Exposure to competitive polities, therefore, needs constant monitoring. We cannot always assume that all

others will play by the rules. For that reason, as an interpreter of the world, diplomacy is also voice of caution. It informs a society of the risks and pitfalls even as it explains opportunities. Doing so in a systemic and organized manner is part of formulating strategy. By its very nature, foreign policy develops a comprehensive outlook and can guide other sectors. It could be trade and technology, or education and tourism. Current times, in particular, require a holistic approach to relationships.

### **ACCESSING A GLOBAL WORKPLACE**

India may be blessed with an enormous human capital. But among the shortcomings is the inability to utilize that advantage to the fullest. Like many other aspects of life, that, too, is changing. National campaigns launched after 2014 are addressing a vast range of socio-economic challenges, ranging from gender discrimination and health to education, skills and employment. In this period, virtually every domain has seen a change due to progressive policymaking. Infrastructure growth, manufacturing expansion, smart cities and labour codes are among the notable examples. Our definition of basic necessities has changed to include access to water, power, housing and health. This has consequences not just for our national ambitions but also for global society.

At a time when demographic constraints are impacting the developed world, there is a real prospect of Indians gaining significantly in the global workplace. Till now, that has been self-driven, with policymakers largely agnostic on this happening. However, a conscious effort at bringing our human capital into play on the world stage can create a different set of outcomes.

Employment prospects of Indian students studying in the US, Canada, Australia and Europe are now prominent in our agenda. Migration and mobility partnerships have been done with Portugal, UK, Australia, France, Germany and Italy, even as other European nations are starting to follow suit. In fact, in the period of Covid-induced uncertainties, the educational interests of students have become a subject of focus.

In terms of skills, we strive to ensure that Indian talent is treated in a nondiscriminatory manner in the US, Canada, Oceania and Europe. Where they already reside, community welfare and cultural concerns, too, are a subject of our attention. The largest numbers with the greatest need are, of course, in

the Gulf. Their well-being is of utmost priority, and that has been fully reflected in decision-making. The liberal usage of the Indian Community Welfare Fund (ICWF) speaks of a stronger sense of responsibility towards them, as do programmes for job training and creating facilities for those in distress. The agreement on rights of domestic workers signed with Kuwait is one illustration of our commitment to ensuring a better workplace abroad. Endeavours to get back social security payments made abroad is another. Indeed, making it easier to get visas has become much more central to our diplomatic efforts.

This mindset, in fact, goes back further up the chain, starting from how much easier it is now to get passports at home. By expanding the application centres four-fold and simplifying the verification process, the ability to travel and work abroad has undergone a sea change. Today, new prospects are opening up for Indian skills as a result of negotiated agreements, be it with Japan, Europe, the Gulf or Russia. Foreign policy is helping to make the world much more accessible to the average Indian. And they set out far more confidently than before, knowing that we have their back in times of difficulty. The Vande Bharat Mission, which brought back millions of Indians during the Covid waves, was as much a statement of capability as of commitment towards our workers and students, seafarers and tourists.

Those who have forayed into the world recently may have grown in numbers. But let us not forget that contemporary migrants join historically established communities to create the largest diaspora in the world. It is natural that their welfare and interest is connected deeply with foreign policy. As India's global standing has gone up, they too have reaped the benefits of association. This is quite apart from the undoubted achievements that they can legitimately boast of in their lands of domicile. In a more globalized world, they inevitably emerged as a more effective bridge to India. At the same time, a confident India has also taken pride in their successes and not shied away from a visible relationship.

In some ways, the Indian diaspora is quite unique because, in contrast with those of other societies, its mobility was not driven by turmoil at home. On the contrary, its bonding with Mother India has grown emotionally stronger with the advent to power of a more authentic representative. The 2014 event at Madison Square Garden marks a new era in diaspora connectivity. Its role has acquired greater value at both ends of the chain. For foreign policy, this may mean some additional responsibilities but surely

provides greater sources of support. As a result, initiatives pertaining to the diaspora have expanded so as to strengthen its bonding with India.

Sensible foreign policies obviously have to address bread and butter issues. However, there are bigger questions to consider as well, especially for large nations. Three contemporary examples of urgent global concerns are pandemics, terrorism and climate change. No country can really afford to be oblivious or indifferent to such challenges. Smaller states are impacted; larger ones even more so. For a nation like India, quite apart from their direct consequences, there is also the need to shape the direction of global debate. This, therefore, becomes as much an exercise of responsibility as of influence.

An examination of the recent record on these matters offers some learnings. India has been a major factor in global deliberations regarding the countering of terrorism. If the awareness of those threats is more or the tolerance is less, our efforts have made no small difference. On climate change, India not only helped forge a consensus in Paris in 2015 but, in contrast to many others, has stayed true to its commitments. In Glasgow in 2021, these were taken to an even higher level. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) are two notable examples of its leadership in climate action. On the pandemic, its supply of medicines and vaccines and deployment of teams abroad spoke volumes about its internationalism.

In the decade that has passed, the new energy in India's endeavours is evident, notably in PM Modi's own engagements. Indian diplomacy has changed profoundly, be it in terms of bilateral visits, collective summits, development partnerships or opening of embassies. Indian citizens of every category are more assured that their concerns are addressed and interests advanced.

The benefits at home of a more proactive approach abroad are equally visible. On the global stage, India's greater relevance is being demonstrated in a variety of ways. Some of it was evident in the conversations and agenda, especially on terrorism, black money, etc. It was also visible, in outcomes and initiatives, notably in Paris and Glasgow on climate change. Our willingness to step forward in disaster-relief situations and to meet the Covid challenge has also been appreciated by the international community. Our national persona, be it on democracy, innovation, yoga, millets or Ayurveda, has gained recognition. We have, in the last few years, steadily

built up the image of a first responder, pharmacy of the world, a reservoir of talent, climate action leader, development partner and cultural powerhouse.

When 10 ASEAN or five Central Asian leaders (virtually) attend our Republic Day, 27 European ones engage us together in a meeting or 41 African leaders come to India for a summit, clearly something has changed for the better. This is the India that took on the presidency of the G20 at a time when the world was, and continues to be, sharply polarized. It used this occasion to not only validate an approach of engaging multiple partners but also speaking up for the Global South.

A stronger and more capable India, one truer to its roots and culture, is a key factor in the larger rebalancing that characterizes our contemporary world. At a time when there are many more power centres, our place in a multipolar order is clearly more assured. In an era that is more globalized, our talents, capabilities and contribution have a growing value for the rest of the world. As we celebrate 75 years of independence, there is good cause for Bharat to be confident about its prospects. But to be so, it is equally important to be fully aware of the opportunities and challenges that the world currently presents. And surely, that will happen once we appreciate that foreign policy really matters to us.
