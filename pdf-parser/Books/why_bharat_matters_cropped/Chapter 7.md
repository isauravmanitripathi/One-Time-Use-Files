## QUAD: A GROUPING FORETOLD

#### When Common Good Requires Fresh Thinking

The importance of the Indo-Pacific as a theatre and the Quad as a diplomatic platform is increasingly being recognized. Some may be interested in their novelty; others may think of them as real global change that is underway. Understandably, they have been the subject of debate and, in some quarters, even of polemics. Both subjects predate the Covid pandemic but have been shaped by it. We intuitively know that it has taken considerable diplomatic energy and determination to realize them.

With its meetings raised to a summit level, the Quad is no longer a bureaucratic mechanism but, instead, a gathering key to national interests. As we contemplate how this came about so rapidly, the more perceptive would appreciate that these were developments just waiting to happen. Indeed, this is a tale of a grouping foretold. But even for that to happen, it required global trends to intersect with strategic clarity and bold leadership. A steady course was equally important as the understandable resistance to a break from the past also unfolded.

After Lord Rama was sent into a forest exile on the eve of his coronation, he thereafter met up with his half-brother Bharata, in whose favour that decision was made. Their meeting (known famously as Bharata Milap) is, of course, a favourite subject for artistic and cultural depiction in the ages since. The hunter-king Guha, on whose lands this encounter takes place, observed the gathering of the four brothers (as the twins Lakshmana and Shatrugana were also there). He marvelled that despite each having their own interests and perspectives, they displayed very visible affection towards each other. It was not that there were no differences or tensions amongst them. Lakshmana, in particular, was deeply aggrieved at the invoking of the boons by Bharata's mother Kaikeyi and that continued to influence his outlook.

But once they come together, the distrust that would be natural in other circumstances was dissipated by their innate bonding. They realized, too, that their collective solidarity had a larger purpose because it resonated throughout the kingdom and allowed them to render their expected service. The ability of those who share values and beliefs to come together for greater good should, therefore, never be underestimated. Particularly once they have learnt to accommodate differences and appreciate a larger purpose, the groundwork is laid for a lasting convergence.

If we are now to consider the campaign underway to recover Queen Sita, Lord Rama brought together a diverse group of players to advance a shared objective. Naturally, the other side made all efforts to sow dissension among this differentiated group. In this particular case, Ravana sent the sorcerer Suka to create discord between monkeys and men. However, Suka failed to achieve his objective, as his insinuations that men do not treat other creatures fairly was strongly rebutted by the monkeys. In fact, his efforts end up counterproductively, bringing into open the conflict of interests of monkeys and demons in the forests that they inhabit together.

Ravana made another attempt with the monkey-prince Angada, invoking what he claimed was a deep friendship with his father Vali. He sought to exploit what would normally be a grudge, since Lord Rama had killed Angada's father. This too failed, as much a result of selfawareness on the prince's part as of the mutual confidence that was steadily encouraged by Rama. In its own way, the Ramayana is also a tale of the power of comfort and convergence as it is of the importance of global good.

#### **THE CHANGING BIG PICTURE**

In many ways, I bear personal testimony to the evolution of the Quad. This goes back to 2005â€“06 as witness to the early efforts to develop it that were particularly driven by Japan. After the 2007 effort, many of us shared the disappointment of an aborted venture. It was, however, typical of an era of ambivalence. A decade later, we were now in a position to both assess the changed geopolitical landscape and learn from the lessons of the past. A meeting at the Foreign Secretary's level in New York in 2017 was a signal that our leaderships had decided to give a new life to an old idea. The difference was also that Quad members now had greater clarity about global deficits and a stronger resolve to contribute. This was probably true of all but most marked in the case of India.

By 2019, the consensus was developing that the time had come to raise the group to a political level. I now had the privilege of participating as the EAM. The 2020 meeting of the Quad foreign ministers in Japan was particularly significant, taking place as it did in the midst of Covid. Just

when the professional pessimists were beginning to pronounce on its prospects again, the logic of strategy asserted itself in 2021. The shared desire to ensure a safer global commons and strengthen Indo-Pacific stability was appreciated at the highest levels of the four governments. The practice of holding summits of Quad leaders took off, developing rapidly in the coming years. Clearly, the Quad has now come of age.

In the bigger picture, the Quad certainly represents an example of the direction in which the world is currently moving. But to see only the outcome and remain oblivious to the reasons that drove it would be to assume that major developments happen out of the blue, which, of course, they don't.

The truth is that a large part of the explanation lies in the corrections that Indian foreign policy made after the Cold War. The changes in its strategic calculations allowed three major relationships, those with the US, Japan and Australia, to unfold more naturally and fully. This journey was not without its issues, India's own nuclear posture and economic positions, as well as the priority given by the others to Pakistan among them. When events unfolded, additional incentives for relationship-building appeared. Concern for regional stability and cooperation on global issues acquired greater salience. The last three decades also brought out the importance of values in international relations. The convergence of these major relationships on the critical challenges of our time was inevitable. And it is the resulting fusion that we now know as the Quad.

Those who ponder about the changes in the Indo-Pacific geography might find it instructive to compare them to developments in Europe three decades ago. It is something of a paradox that even though Asia has been more dynamic than Europe, its regional architecture is far more conservative. Part of the explanation lies in the fact that Europe was very much at the heart of the Cold War and felt its termination more directly. The fall of the Berlin Wall opened up the ground for strategic experimentation that has led to the expanded EU as we know it now.

In contrast, there was no such seminal development in Asia. On the contrary, this was an era of steady economic progress and an accompanying political stasis. Moreover, the region had a much vaster expanse with greater diversity and a less collective persona than Europe. In fact, there were distinct sub-regions, such as Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Oceania, each with their particular characteristics and history.

Prosperity also unfolded at a differential pace, both between and within these sub-regions. Till recently, they did not perceive an overarching scenario that required a shared response. To the extent that when they needed an agreed meeting point, it was provided by ASEAN-driven platforms. Most importantly, the deep underpinning to the larger stability provided by a pervasive presence of American power has helped to keep the theatre steady till now. It is the revisiting of many of these assumptions and attitudes now that has started to shape the emergence of the Indo-Pacific.

To begin with, there is the reality of the repositioning of the US. Some of it may be reflected in its changed resources and commitments, but there is also the relative growth of competitors and the increasing complexity of challenges. Both the landscape and the tasking demand a response that cannot be the same as before. Call it 'America First' or a foreign policy for the middle class, there is widespread recognition of a new era. Where the differences lie within the US are in respect of the vision, attitude and strategy. These are not just divergent but very consequential in their impact on the rest of the world.

The US is undeniably the premier power of our times and will remain so. Indeed, such is its centrality to the current order that be it an ally, a competitor, the agnostic or the undecided, none of us can really be indifferent to its posture. There are different ways by which the US is coming to terms with its constraints and its challenges. And, as we have all seen since 2008, that has not exactly followed a predictable path. Some of the US's answers lie in reprioritizing; some in a more mobile and affordable footprint; and some perhaps in more tools of influence. Building a technology and financial edge has long worked for it and maintaining that against stiffer competition will be another national response. Where the US, as an entrenched power, is understandably struggling is in respect of new manifestations of exerting influence and wielding power. As an open society, it is not easy to deal with rivals with command polities. It not only has inherent vulnerabilities but also structural constraints while practising these contemporary forms of competition.

But what is important to recognize is that in its own unique way, the American polity is going through a serious introspection. That could well result in a different method of engaging the world. Among its policy changes are a greater emphasis on burden sharing and openness to partners beyond

established relationships. Its search for global solutions leads it to contemplate a new form of plurilateralism.

The second big driver of the changes we see around us is, of course, the growth of Chinese power. There are three autonomous aspects to this phenomenon that need considered analysis. The first is the enormous expansion of Chinese capabilities in virtually every field. The second is a projection pattern that changed beginning with 2009 and, more vigorously, after 2012. The third, and this was particularly apparent during the pandemic, is China's deep relevance to the global economy. These trends obviously cannot be viewed in isolation and must also be seen in terms of their implications for others. They have propelled global economic and strategic rebalancing, that too in a radical manner.

The US, as the dominant power of the day, is the most affected on both scores. Equally, the changes have had an influence on the rules and practices of the current order, management of the global commons and on the nature of world politics itself. None of that is surprising given that the combined import of these developments has been multiplied by their focussed leveraging for strategic purposes. That seamlessness exhibited abroad by China is a reflection of both a tightly integrated worldview and its domestic outlook.

So, let us be clear that this is not just about the rise of simply another power, however major. We have entered a new phase in international relations and the full impact of China's re-emergence will be felt more than those of major powers before it. And naturally, the reverberations are strongest in its immediate vicinity.

These developments centring on the US and China are largely responsible for the concept of the Indo-Pacific taking root so rapidly. They have fundamentally shaken the old order but not yet created a new one. The region has come to grudgingly appreciate that it can neither be insulated from their relationship nor indeed indifferent to what it portends for global goods. What this has in common with a very dissimilar situation in Europe a generation ago is that sharp geopolitical changes are redefining the very contours of the landscape. In Europe, it happened when American power was at its peak, encouraging a generosity that overcame the cautions of that continent's history. In the Indo-Pacific, it is a very different story, where it is the relative limitations of American abilities that has triggered a rethinking on the part of all parties.

Both, in their own ways, have encouraged a greater sense of collectivism. It was also inevitable that such a significant transformation in the relative weight, influence and behaviour of players should lead to a re-imagining of the arena itself. The irony is that those who are projected as taking the lead are actually coming to terms with a scenario that the fortunes of others have helped create.

### **THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACT EAST**

There is more than adequate evidence of how integrated economic and cultural activities have been between the Indian and the Pacific oceans in history. By its very nature, the maritime domain supersedes artificial barriers and manmade lines. Whether it is trade or faith, mobility or practices, monuments or relationships, we know that the energies of its community traversed the waters over the ages with great comfort.

Assigning labels and restricting activities is a relatively modern phenomenon. In this particular case, the sharp differentiation within the Indo-Pacific was very much the result of the 1945 outcomes. In fact, it has a specific American signature to it that is highlighted by the milestones of its preoccupations in the Far East. Among them are the Second World War itself, the revolution in China, the Korean War, the revival of Japan and the Vietnam War.

As a result, it was quickly forgotten that much of what happened in that theatre was actually driven by forces residing in the Indian Ocean. To that extent, there is again a similarity to the Europe of the previous era. The interests of one great power distort the entire landscape and create concepts for its convenience. But here, too, the wheel of history has started to turn, and the old normal is reasserting itself.

The Indo-Pacific debate has, on occasion, been marked by charges of Cold War thinking. In fact, the truth is the very opposite. That is not surprising given that such rhetoric comes from the very quarters who seek to freeze the advantages of 1945. The Indo-Pacific suggests integration and plurality; its denial means division and dominance. And criticism is really meant to advance classic Cold War goals of constraining freedom of choice and exerting pressure to conform. In fact, to see the Indo-Pacific in binary terms when the interests of many are involved is a dead giveaway. The Indian Ocean may have been relegated to being a strategic backwater for

seven decades after the Second World War. But today, it is not only a critical global lifeline but one smoothly fusing into the waters of the Pacific. The actions of the major powers active in the Indo-Pacific speak volumes of their integrated vision. So, if we judge nations by what they do rather than what they preach, the picture is quite clear.

At the end of the day, the compulsions of interdependence and interpenetration have triumphed over outdated definitions. Concerns about the well-being of the global commons were also a factor. Contemporary challenges required like-minded nations to work together, especially once the US acknowledged the difficulties of going alone. The Indo-Pacific, in that sense, represents the reality of globalization as much as it does the results of rebalancing.

A significant contribution to the change in landscape has been made by India's Act East policy. Three decades ago, India adopted a more open economic model that helped forge closer ties with the ASEAN and Northeast Asia. In due course, this opening acquired other dimensions, including those of connectivity, security, education and societal exchanges. The domains of activity may be different, but starting from the 1990s, India's ties with ASEAN, Japan, South Korea and China have developed far greater substance and, consequently, higher priority. Australia was a subsequent happening, but political and security convergences allowed this relationship to play catchup.

What began for India as a solution for an economic crisis has finally ended up as a strategic correction. Today, India trades with, travels to and interacts with the East much more than it has done since its independence. Here, too, there is a falling back to history as there is a long tradition of Indian maritime activity and presence, going all the way up to the Fujian coast of China. Those who have been to the temples of Angkor Wat, Borobudur or My Son will certainly attest to these linkages.

As we consider the emerging Indo-Pacific, its policy consequences obviously drive the strategic debate. From India's perspective, its embedding in ASEAN-led structures over decades has created a regular and comfortable interface with all the players. In fact, as India's vistas kept broadening eastwards, economic stakes were supplemented by political and security relationships with those partners that nursed common interests. It could be a global forum like the G-20 or a regional one like the IORA, all of them provided additional opportunities for greater socialization. Even otherwise,

those with a similar outlook and shared values tend to congregate together. But when the entire region grapples with new issues and different capacities, then those inclinations become stronger.

At the heart of the Quad, however, is a level of comfort generated by a marked improvement in multiple sets of relationships. This is enhanced by a stronger sense of common purpose in the face of regional and global challenges. Obviously, the collective ease is based on shared interests and some similar characteristics. But all of this also happened because the resistance to reforming international organizations and limitations of regional ones compelled a search for practical solutions. They, in essence, made the case for the Quad.

#### **A TALE OF THREE TIES**

The origins of the Quad actually go back to the coordination among the same four countries who responded to the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Subsequent conversations led to a diplomatic gathering of their representatives in 2007. This did not progress further as none of the participants were really prepared to invest sufficient political capital in the initiative at that point of time.

The natural question, therefore, is what changed between 2007 and 2017 when the Quad, now in a more serious incarnation, assembled in New York. The current Quad did not come out of nowhere. It was an accumulated product of multiple developments, among them the complementary capabilities of key players, a more integrated arena and a greater openness to look beyond orthodox constructs.

But the real shift was in the enormous progress that some of the relevant bilateral ties had made in this very decade. The other three nations already had strong relationships with each other, though these too deepened discernibly in this period. What they did not have in 2007 was the degree of convergence and cooperation with India, which they had attained by 2017. Equally important was a leadership in our country that did not subject its national interests to the test of ideological preference.

This was particularly notable in regard to ties between India and the US. Those with Japan followed some distance behind. There was admittedly a greater time lag with Australia, since ties with India warmed up only after the 2014 political changes. It is in the story of these changed relationships

that we must seek the explanation for the rapid development of the Quad. In the case of Japan and Australia, the relationship that India had was much thinner both in content and scope. Where the US was concerned, there were some sectoral strengths in an overall substantive but differentiated engagement. But even these had their limitations.

In the last decade, India's systemic interface with its Quad partners expanded very significantly. It extended across many more domains and enabled a full spectrum engagement with them. Naturally, the challenges and opportunities were different in each case. But as they gained traction, lessons and experiences from one were helpful to the advancement of the others.

### *The Rediscovery of America*

Let us start with the US. The current phase of ties with India can be traced back to President Bill Clinton's visit in 2000. The background may have been of the effective management of the political consequences of the 1998 nuclear tests. But the driver was more a coming together in a globalizing world. It is essential that this starting point be duly recognized because it confirms that India and the US upgraded their engagement seeing an intrinsic value in doing so. This was the era of the dotcom revolution and H1B visa. American dominance was quite pronounced globally and there was really no 'balance of power' argument that was driving the changes. It was, in fact, the improving prosperity, expanding talent and a larger global exposure of India that made it a better partner in American eyes.

In many ways, this was a natural progression of the relationship once the constraints of the Cold War era receded. Suggesting, as some do, that these ties do not have their own merit and must necessarily be directed against others is a mind game being played to discredit both the relationship and the Quad. This is all the more contestable, given how those making such charges have leveraged their own relationship with the US so enthusiastically in the past when it suited them. Obviously, when a judgement is proffered by a party with a stake in the outcome, it must be seen for what it is.

Progress in Indiaâ€“US ties accelerated during the Bush administration, which correctly identified the nuclear impediment as a major obstacle to serious cooperation. By this time, both sides wanted a more normal relationship, freed from the encumbrances of the past. Therefore, they proceeded determinedly in that direction, successfully addressing the

domestic political challenges to that process. This was also a moment when authoritative US studies focussed more strongly on the global relevance of India's human resources. Pretty much across the board, cooperative trends gathered momentum in a positive atmosphere. It was visible in defence, civil aviation, science and technology, trade and mobility.

The successful conclusion of the Indiaâ€“US nuclear deal widened the pathway to greater shared endeavours. That five successive American presidents, who were so different from each other, have been united in their pursuit of better ties with India has been a real game-changer. This consistency holds true at the Indian end as well. As a result, a relationship that was earlier notable for its argumentation and distancing has undergone a sea change.

There are many ways of capturing the transformation that has been underway for more than a decade. Trade is one obvious indicator, and it has expanded fivefold in the last 15 years. Investment is much harder to accurately define in national terms, but it has clearly multiplied in this period. The flow of talent is relevant because technology forms such a key element of the ties. The H category of visas, which enabled techies to move between the two countries, almost doubled in the last decade-and-a-half. So, too, has the number of students from India.

In some domains, this progress can be expressed through decisions and agreements. That a country that bought no American defence platforms from 1965 for four decades should now operate C-130, C-17 and P-8 aircraft, as well as Apache, Chinook and MH-60R helicopters, is not a mean achievement. Indeed, the security dimension of the relationship should be judged by more than defence trade. Policy exchanges and military exercises also testify to this shift, as do the multiple agreements that promote closer coordination. The mechanisms and dialogues today span a very wide range of subjects, from counter-terrorism and cyber security to climate action and energy, from space cooperation and health to education and homeland security.

What has changed further is that while the focus till 2014 was to remove obstacles to cooperation, the endeavour after that has been to ambitiously realize its expanding potential. Prime Minister Modi's 2023 State visit to the US, in that sense, marks a new phase of ties. The expanding agenda of cooperation and its growing relevance to key global debates underlines how far the relationship has now come. While important in themselves, the

understanding on transfer of technology for jet engines and the collaborative steps in the semiconductor domain hold a symbolism far beyond. American business is beginning to overcome its long-standing scepticism about India, just as its military is learning to work with a non-alliance culture. Its strategic community is displaying a better understanding of India's value as its technology sector appreciates the significance of closer collaboration. Truly, the relationship has now moved into a higher orbit.

Although the ties have undergone a profound change, some of the divergences of the past need to be borne in mind to navigate the future in a better way. A large part of the contradiction between the interests of the two nations arose from the traditional American approach to the Indian subcontinent. The interest in hyphenating India and Pakistan and seeking to influence their bilateral dealings has been an entrenched attitude. The deliberate permissiveness with regard to Pakistan's nuclear programme in the 1980â€“90s was its most extreme manifestation. The US presence in Afghanistan also created new factors of regional dependency that were not in harmony with its India relationship.

Moreover, the global outlook of the US was often on a different wavelength from the security and economic interests of India. Even on the nuclear account, the 2005 understanding did not always set to rest more doctrinaire American advocacy in that domain. It was also natural that the worldview, policies and diplomacy of two partners, one developed and the other still developing, would differ on a range of socio-economic issues. Nor was it unexpected that a dominant prescriptive polity should rub against a sensitive sovereignty-conscious society.

Indeed, some of these very traits combined to create challenges for the relationship in 2013â€“14. But structural changes underway, along with policy optimism, came together to ensure that ties returned to their upward trajectory and stayed that way. It is not that the two nations do not have differences; what has changed is the willingness to nevertheless find common ground and pursue mutual advantage. Indeed, it has been an example of how an open-minded appreciation of contemporary changes has refashioned a pre-existing relationship.

The breadth and intensity of cooperation over the last decade has been truly impressive. It is, of course, driven by much more frequent engagement at the leadership level, and by more comfortable conversations. This is supported at the cabinet and sub-cabinet levels through regular interactions

on a wider scale. New mechanisms and dialogues have sprung up in every field of activity. Foundational agreements, contemporary frameworks and a larger volume of activity are all part of the change. And wherever that is quantifiable, trade, investments, students, visas, exchanges, the numbers tell their own story.

What started as an evolutionary exercise with a limited objective has not only mushroomed rapidly but is now developing increasingly higher levels of ambition. From the bilateral and regional agendas, ties have matured to cover a broader canvas and a more complex agenda. That the two nations are partnering each other in quadrilateral and trilateral groupings is a statement of how far their relations have come.

It is particularly notable that this growth enjoys strong societal support. There is, of course, the Indian diaspora factor in the US and the Congressional support. Because so much of the relationship is driven by so many constituencies of civil society, it can also be effervescent at times. Today, the strength of the bilateral ties encourages the two nations to work together beyond the narrower confines of their national interest.

Even as this unfolds, India and the US will also have to recognize that they approach the world from different vantage points, histories, culture and levels of development. From an Indian perspective, the US as a global power can, on occasion, have interests that are in contradiction with its own. Nor may it always share our priorities and perspectives. This naturally will be mirror imaged on the American side as well, especially as India's influence and footprint expands. It is, therefore, all the more important that strong levels of comfort are established at this juncture. Because willy-nilly, the two countries will have much more to do with each other in the times to come.

## *Rising with the Sun*

The two decades that witnessed such significant developments in respect of the US also saw steady progress with Japan. Challenges for India on this account were, however, very different. Unlike the US, Japan did not have a pronounced history of leaning towards Pakistan during the Cold War. It was, of course, given to some degree of hyphenation like much of the Western world.

But for reasons rooted in history and culture, there was always a partiality in Japanese politics towards India. Respect for an ancient civilization was widely shared, and the immediate post-War period actually witnessed political warmth between the leaderships. Indian policies conveyed their sympathy for Japan's predicament, and the dissenting voice of Justice Radhabinod Pal at the Tokyo Tribunal was subtly appreciated.

On its part, Japan supported India's socio-economic goals through substantial levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA). Within the Western camp, on a range of issues, it was among the friendlier voices. The paradox of the relationship, in fact, was that the very lack of problems also limited policy attention.

As with many other states, Indiaâ€“Japan ties also felt the implications of what befell India during this period. Economically, a traditionally broad presence of Japanese companies failed to strike deep roots in the absence of a welcoming environment. They gravitated instead to Southeast Asia and, thereafter, to China, lowering India steadily in terms of Japanese priorities. Even when economic reforms were introduced in 1991, the Japanese business community responded with great caution, expressed in a demand that the enabling environment should come up to their expectations.

The thinness of the interface was not limited only to business, it also extended to the supportive activities that Japan normally encouraged. Whether it was education, culture or travel, the two nations continued to remain distant, even if pleasantly. The political domain was not helpful in this period either. There were already the compulsions of the Cold War that pulled the two countries in opposing directions. India's defeat in 1962 in the border conflict with China had obviously damaged its standing as well, and its economic struggles thereafter strengthened a negative stereotype.

Sometimes, situations get worse before getting better. This happened in the instant case when India's nuclear tests in 1998 shook the ties out of their complacency. It is understandable, given its history, that Japan should react strongly to that development. What was, however, perplexing to the Indian side was its sweeping disregard of the security compulsions of the other party. This was aggravated by the fact that Japan had not hesitated to ensure its own security through a treaty arrangement with a nuclear power. Relations really took a dip when Japanese policymakers of that period decided to lead the charge against India in international forums.

The resulting freeze in the relationship ended up providing an opportunity for both nations to introspect on its value. And from that exercise emerged a new phase of our bilateral ties. Just as President Clinton's visit marked the breakthrough in one relationship, that of PM Yoshiro Mori did in the other. And interestingly, while President George W. Bush took it to a higher level in regard to the US, PM Shinzo Abe did so even more personally in respect of Japan. His famous 'The Confluence of Two Seas' speech to the Indian Parliament in 2007 was not only a turning point for the bilateral relationship but an early vision of what emerged as the Indo-Pacific. The context for that unfolding is also worth recalling.

A decade-and-a-half ago, Japan, too, was contemplating an increasingly uncertain external environment that required it to contemplate greater responsibilities. Given its complex history, this naturally was accompanied by an involved domestic debate. A society with a broader agenda and taking a greater interest in world affairs will understandably look for more partners. India, no longer distanced by the Cold War, offered obvious attraction. Some of this was a regional convergence, some a shared quest for better UN representation and some a natural empathy of democratic societies. So here, too, the bilateral wheels began to move on their own logic. As they gathered greater traction, vistas of cooperation also opened up.

Between India and Japan now, the political messaging is strong, underlined by a practice of annual summits since 2006. Despite changes in administrations on both ends, the pace of cooperation has not slackened. As in the case of the US, this continuity is the strongest proof of structural change. The official description of the relationship has continuously grown, titled most recently in 2014 as a Special Strategic and Global Partnership. Trade may have remained limited despite a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2011, but Japanese investments in India have expanded both in sectors and volume. Japan ranks fifth as a source of investment and more ambitious goals were set during PM Fumio Kishida's visit in 2022.

The economic partnership as a whole has intensified, whether we consider currency swaps or development assistance. In fact, the ODA has more than doubled in the last decade itself, with disbursement touching Â¥328 billion in 2021â€“22. Its implementation record has been impressive, boasting so far of six metro rails in key Indian cities and a number of other major connectivity projects. What has also changed is a Japanese inclination to

shape a more conducive infrastructure, expressed in its support for industrial and freight corridors. There are ongoing dialogues now in energy, space, steel, textile, start-up funding, digital skills and healthcare, among others.

The high-speed rail project from Mumbai to Ahmedabad stands out as the flagship initiative. Given its ripple impact, it can even be envisaged as the third technology revolution, following upon that of the Maruti-Suzuki car and the Delhi Metro. Similarly, while the ODA cooperation is a long-standing one, the Act East Forum established in 2017 specifically targets improved connectivity for India's Northeast.

But it is those familiar with the intricacies of Japanese society who are more likely to appreciate the progress with India. The yardsticks for that are examples of cooperation in domains of particular sensitivity. The 2016 agreement to cooperate on civil nuclear energy is an even more telling illustration of the growing comfort. No less significant are the series of understandings in the domain of defence and security. The 2014 agreement on defence cooperation was followed by those on equipment transfers and information protection in 2015, naval cooperation in 2018 and reciprocal supplies and services in 2020. Policy exchanges in defence have been supported by staff talks between services as well as bilateral and plurilateral military exercises. As with the US, India holds 2+2 ministerial meetings with Japan since 2019. Again, the bilateral comfort is beginning to be transposed on a wider canvas, starting predictably with the US and Australia.

## *Building a New Mateship*

The relationship that has developed most visibly in recent times is that with Australia. Indeed, within a short space of time, it has narrowed the gap that stood out in comparison to the other two Quad members. As in the case of the US and Japan, the 1998 nuclear tests did impact ties and the road to recovery was also not an easy one. But the Australian relationship also carried its own unique challenges. It says something about India's priorities that the first prime ministerial visit took two full decades after independence, that of Indira Gandhi in 1968.

In many ways, Australia tended to be the most distant of the Anglosphere partners. It displayed the attitude of the US to issues east of India and the approach of the UK to concerns on the west. On the other hand, the Commonwealth framework ensured that there were steady exchanges in a

large number of domains, including defence, commerce, training and education. What was a substantial but not high-profile relationship also took a marked dip in 1998. Australia took the lead in calling for a special session of the Conference on Disarmament and co-sponsored a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) condemning India's nuclear tests. More significantly, it suspended defence cooperation and froze official contacts. The story was, in many ways, very similar to that of Japan.

It took a year for the two sides to step back from the confrontational posture. The visit of Deputy PM Tim Fisher in 1999 could be credited as the beginning of the thaw. In a sense, Australia was ahead of Japan in repairing its ties, evidenced in the visits of Foreign Minister Alexander Downer and PM John Howard in March and July 2000 respectively. The return to normalcy progressed steadily and was accelerated somewhat by the tail winds of the 2005 nuclear deal. But the reality nevertheless was that neither nation devoted the political attention to the other which was required to take ties to a higher level.

Certainly, on the Indian side, there was a continued perception that Australia had neither de-hyphenated its subcontinental relationships nor emerged from a general disinterest about the region. not matched the US or even Japan in. So, for almost a decade more, the progress of ties was left largely to civil society and market forces. It took the two-way visits of PMs Tony Abbott and Narendra Modi in 2014 to open the gates for cooperation that was so long delayed.

That ties developed so rapidly once political leadership came into play only underlines the extent of the structural convergence. The ambitions that guide this exercise are best explained by *An India Economic Strategy to 2035 Report* released by the Australian side and the *Australia Economic Strategy* issued by India. A trade of \$20 billion plus and investments around \$25 billion stand to benefit with a free trade arrangement whose initial phase has commenced. Australia is a major educational destination for Indian students, who now number in excess of 100,000. The Indian community, the second most rapidly growing one, is a source of strength for both societies.

But it is really in the realm of politics and strategy that the transformation has been most evident. Much of the growing convergence has been driven by concerns about the region's stability, prosperity and security. The deficit in global goods has sought to be addressed by India and Australia working together bilaterally as well as in larger forums. This reflects their shared

concerns about respect for international law and a rules-based order. The two countries may have long interacted in ASEAN-led forums, the Commonwealth, IORA, etc. But stronger leadership bonding and more open exchanges have brought out the mutual benefits of closer cooperation and coordination. Australia has been an early and vigorous supporter of India's IPOI. In fact, the big change has been the realization that a stronger bilateral relationship today allows the two nations to contribute much more effectively at a regional and a global level.

The new intensity in the interactions has been on display at the highest level, despite multiple changes at the Australian end. It is notable that their Comprehensive Strategic Partnership covers an annual meeting of PMs, a foreign minister's dialogue, a 2+2 ministerial mechanism, a trade ministerial commission, an education council, an energy dialogue and sectoral working groups. Clearly, the days of attention deficit are now over for good. Recent agreements range from maritime collaboration, defence science exchanges and mutual logistics support to cooperation in cyber-enabled critical technology, critical and strategic minerals, water resources management, migration and mobility, vocational education and training, as well as public administration and governance.

Some milestones do bring out the interactive dynamic between the bilateral and the regional facets of the relationship. Greater political confidence and deeper defence cooperation, for example, contributed to Australia joining Exercise Malabar. A better understanding on the space applications front led to the Australian support for the temporary Telemetry Tracking and Command Centre for the Gaganyaan Mission. A shared concern about trade reliability and economic volatility encouraged a partnership on the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative (SCRI), along with Japan. The conclusion of the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) in 2022 was not just a trade deal; it was an expression of systemic confidence as well. It also says a lot that Australian universities have been the first to take advantage of India's New Education Policy to set up establishments in the country.

As with US and Japan, a change in leadership reaffirmed in the Tokyo Quad Summit that cooperation was now proofed strongly in respect of political developments. Indeed, the enthusiasm of each successive government more than matched those of its predecessors.

### **INTENTIONS OVERCOME HESITATIONS**

In assessing the Indo-Pacific, there are also dimensions that are autonomous of such bilateral matters, as indeed of the Quad. Prominent among them is the IPOI, announced by PM Modi in 2019 at the East Asia Summit. This is envisaged as an open, non-treaty-based, inclusive platform for cooperation in the region. Structure-light and cooperation-heavy, it is intended to work in tandem with other mechanisms like the ASEAN, IORA, BIMSTEC, IOC, PIF, etc. Its seven pillars include maritime security, maritime ecology; maritime resources; capacity building and resource sharing; disaster risk reduction and management; science, technology and academic cooperation; and trade connectivity and maritime transport. So far, Australia has agreed to lead the maritime ecology pillar, Japan the connectivity one, France and Indonesia the maritime resources, Singapore the science and technology one, and the UK the maritime security pillar.

How the IPOI will develop remains to be seen. But it is certainly an example of fresh thinking on regional partnerships that has the potential to move cooperation in the Indo-Pacific forward. That ASEAN, the EU and individual nations have all tabled their own outlook, vision and approaches augurs well for the future. It is also an interesting thought that as India's global footprint steadily grows, it intersects with the interests of its Quad partners. A telling case is that of India's engagement with the Pacific Island nations. Relationships between like-minded countries tend to be naturally supportive beyond the confines of their actual interaction. And the complex challenges of the contemporary world certainly can use more effective international cooperation.

India is establishing IT labs in these Pacific Island societies and promoting solar electrification. Women solar engineers called Solar Mamas have also been trained. Apart from climate-related projects, Indian grant assistance supports community development, agricultural equipment, computers and LED bulbs for schools, dialysis machines, portable saw mills as well as construction of sea wall and coral farms. As noted elsewhere, the level of cooperation is being significantly upgraded as a consequence of the 2023 FIPIC Summit, especially in the domains of health, education and space.

India has responded to natural calamities, including cyclones Yasa, Gita, Hola and Winston, and dispatched vaccines for Covid to Fiji and Nauru bilaterally, as also to Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands through the COVAX initiative. There is a historical connect in particular with Fiji that can be the foundation of a modern collaboration. All these factors came together at the third FIPIC Summit that was held in Papua New Guinea in 2023.

The Quad nations are all democratic polities, market economies and pluralistic societies. Apart from that natural understanding, similarity in the structural aspects of their relationships has helped to foster the platform. In each case, there are regular bilateral meetings at the summit level, designated formally as annual in the case of Australia and Japan. All the ties now include a 2+2 defence and foreign ministers' interaction. Again, all four countries are members of ASEAN-led forums, including the East Asia Summit, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting. They also strongly subscribe to the centrality of ASEAN insofar as the Indo-Pacific is concerned. Between them, they are involved in multiple trilateral combinations with other partners, such as Indonesia and France.

In many ways, the ease of working together has been increased by other experiences, whether they are bilateral or more collective. That all of them offer mutual logistics support and work on white shipping obviously enables better maritime security coordination. Their shared view of United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982 as the constitution of the seas is no less relevant. Similarly, three of them (Japan, Australia and India) being members of the SCRI and the IPOI makes a difference. The working of the Quad takes into account the consequences of globalization and requirements of the global commons. There is undoubtedly a strong shared interest in the oceanic domain as all members are maritime powers. In fact, well before the revival of the Quad, some of them were conducting the Malabar Exercise among themselves. And the same convergence is also underlined in the support they expressed together in Tokyo in 2022 for the IPMDA. But significant as this may be, any one-dimensional projection does injustice to a group that can make a serious contribution to larger welfare. It is, therefore, essential to have informed visibility of the entire Quad landscape. And it does span a growing range of issues.

Where critical and emerging technologies are concerned, the Quad adopted principles on technology design, development, governance and use in 2021. It urged that democratic values and human rights shape the design,

governance and application of technologies. The adoption of the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Action Plan encouraged a diverse, open and interoperable telecommunication ecosystem. This was followed by an agreement to facilitate exchanges and align closely on O-RAN testing activities. The Quad obviously has an interest in the expansive deployment of O-RAN across the Indo-Pacific.

In parallel, there have been discussions on the global semiconductor value chain. That the Quad members have come up with a common statement on technology supply chain principles says much for the importance they attach to this domain. Given the twin concerns of supply chain resilience and digital trust, it is natural that the Quad should be heavily focussed on the future of trusted collaboration. Progress in this domain will only further underline its salience in contemporary global architecture.

Climate action has been another significant area of attention. Here, too, the Quad has sought to apply itself to practical initiatives. The green shipping network between the four aspires to decarbonize the shipping value chain and to establish green corridors in the Indo-Pacific. India has a particular interest in exploring collaboration on green hydrogen and to dovetail it with its national mission. The Quad has also partnered with the CDRI in its adaptation and resilient activities. This is aimed at collectively advancing climate monitoring and disaster risk reduction in the Indo-Pacific.

Infrastructure has been a natural focus, given the widespread unease generated by strategically led connectivity initiatives. Given the nature of the challenge, much of the deliberations are on debt management and debt sustainability. The development assistance institutions are coordinating on promoting sustainable and alternative financing. There is a clear recognition that high standard infrastructure based on transparency and market viability should be promoted for the larger benefit of the region.

In the light of the pandemic, it was to only be expected that the Quad would come together in its vaccine supply endeavours. The group cooperated to expand manufacturing capacity of World Health Organization (WHO) approved vaccines and collaborate with COVAX to track demand, as also with WHO to overcome vaccine hesitancy. On its part, India has provided more than half a million 'Made in India' vaccine doses to Cambodia and Thailand under the Quad Vaccine Partnership. Other notable areas of cooperation have been the Quad Data Satellite Portal and the STEM

fellowships. The analysis on climate change risks and sustainable use of oceans and marine resources is high on the Quad agenda.

An important outcome from the Tokyo Summit in 2022 was the Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) partnership for the Indo-Pacific. This has a symbolic resonance, given the 2004 tsunami cooperation. These initial agreements have now led to the finalization of the Quad's standard operating procedures. At a time when climate events are proliferating and global responses are declining, this will fill a significant gap.

By the time the Quad leaders assembled in Hiroshima in May 2023, they were ready to jointly articulate their most comprehensive collective outlook to date. This included a detailed agenda that addressed climate action, supply chains, pandemic and health concerns, infrastructure, education, connectivity, digital capabilities, standards, R&D, cyber and space technologies and maritime domain awareness. They issued three statements of principles: on clean energy supply chains, critical and emerging technology standards, and secure software. Their global and regional perspectives, while reiterating many known positions, clearly highlighted where the convergences were strongest. As each year, indeed each meeting, widens the ambit of cooperation, it is increasingly clear that Quad is here not just to stay but to grow steadily.

An interesting feature of the evolution of the Quad, and it is still continuing, is how the comfort levels are constantly encouraging exploration of new areas. In early 2023, this was visible in domains ranging from maritime security, multilateralism, counter-terrorism and HADR. When it came to the IORA, the Quad members committed to working more intensively together, as they visibly did in the 2023 Colombo meet. The Maritime Security Working Group similarly met in the US to take more practical steps, even as the IPMDA started to take shape.

On multilateralism, the Quad supported for the first time the Inter-Governmental Negotiations (IGN) process on Security Council reforms. It agreed to address attempts to subvert the UN and international system and to take forward the 2030 Agenda for SDG without prioritizing a narrow set of goals.

A different cluster of issues illustrate the contribution that the Quad can make to keep the world and itself safer, secure and protected. On counterterrorism, starting with policy exchanges and experience sharing, the

potential for mutual benefit was rapidly explored. A working group was established even as the focus on the use of emerging and evolving technologies in terrorism sharpened. Cyber security is also evolving as a productive arena of work. Sharing model approaches, encouraging development of talent, ensuring supply chain resilience and security and networking industries are its prominent facets.

The objective of the Quad, in the words of PM Modi, is to do global good. The need for that to be a collaborative effort is self-evident. It is equally natural that nations with significant capacities and shared interests would step forward in response to the need of the day. That India should be one of them makes sense, given how much it has grown on both scores. Indeed, its presence imbues the Quad with greater credibility because it does not carry a history of alliances. But for this to happen through partnerships with the three Quad countries was not always a given.

It can unfold today because painstaking efforts were made over many years to strengthen the bilateral relationships, which are the real building blocks. But even that, by itself, was not adequate. It took considerable openness of mind in all the Quad leaderships to envisage collaboration in a more contemporary manner.

Indeed, the Quad is proof that PM Modi walked the talk in declaring his intention to overcome hesitations of history. Similarly, the other three nations took a leap of faith beyond the orthodoxies of alliances. Since 2017, practical progress has validated the relevance of this sensible approach.

If the Quad is to continue growing, we must also be cognizant of what we should not seek to do. Trying to straitjacket it, subject it to stress tests or impose congruence over convergence are all harmful, not helpful. The Quad works precisely because it is flexible and understanding, a welcome supersession of the rigidities of the Cold War era. Therefore, efforts to set expectations that are modelled on the relationship that the US had with its Western partners should be resisted. Nor should we readily accept the opposite paradigm, that of a purely transactional arrangement. Each one of the Quad partners has its own culture and tradition, but the fact is that there is a strong democratic overlap. Fortunately, the governments in question have all shown a maturity that would, hopefully, also percolate more deeply into the public discourse.

The Quad is the aggregate of the progress India has made in key relationships over two decades. It is also an assertion of going beyond

traditional confines and set working habits. That it has opened up so many new vistas should only encourage us to intensify it further. This coming together for an agreed agenda powered by a shared outlook is manifestly a statement of practical goodness. It is, at the same time, a revelation how a crucial landscape, when examined by a Bharat with clearer eyes, will help find its own solutions.
