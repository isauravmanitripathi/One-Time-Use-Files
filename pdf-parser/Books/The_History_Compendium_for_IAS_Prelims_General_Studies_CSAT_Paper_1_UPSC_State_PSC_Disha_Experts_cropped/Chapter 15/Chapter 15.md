# Introduction

The *Saiyyid and the Lodhi* rules failed to stop the decline of the Delhi Sultanate. *Babur* took full advantage of the political chaos and established the rule of the *Mughal Dynasty* in India. The Mughals were able to create strong structures of administration and ideas of governance.

The 'classic period' of the Mughal Empire is believed to begin in 1556 with the coronation of *Akbar* to the throne. Under the rule of *Akbar*, the region enjoyed economic progress as well as religious harmony. Akbar himself was a successful warrior and he forged strategic alliances with several Hindu Rajput kingdoms. Though some Rajput kingdoms continued to pose a threat to the Mughal dominance, most of them were subdued by Akbar. By the mid-18th century, the *Marathas* had defeated Mughals. They won over several Mughal provinces from Punjab to Bengal. Due to the weakness of the Mughal Empire's administrative and economic systems, internal dissatisfaction arose that led to the break-up of the empire. The declaration of independence of its former provinces by the *Nawab of Bengal, the Nawab of Awadh, the Nizam of Hyderabad* and other small states also added to the chaos.

In 1739, the Mughals were defeated in the *Battle of Karnal* by the forces of *Nader Shah* leading to the loot in Delhi. During the following century Mughal power had become limited and the last emperor, *Bahadur Shah II*, had his dominance over the city of *Shahjahanabad*. He issued a *firman* supporting the Indian Rebellion of 1857. After the defeat, he was tried by the British East India Company for treason, imprisoned and exiled to *Rangoon*. The last remnants of the empire were formally taken over by the British. *The Government of India Act* 1858 facilitated the British Crown formally assume direct control of India in the form of the new *British Raj*.

# **FEATURES OF MUGHAL ADMINISTRATION**

# **The Mughal Central Government**

The principal officers of the Mughal central government were four:

**1. Diwan:** The Diwan, often called *the wazir* (the chief minister), was mainly concerned with revenue and finance, but he had a say in all matters where any expenditure was involved. All the imperial orders were first recorded in his office before being issued.

- **2. Mir Bakhshi:** The Mir Bakhshi performed those duties which had been the responsibility of the *ariz*-*i*-*mamalik* during the earlier period. Some foreign travellers called him *the lieutenant-general or the captain-general*.
- **3. Mir Saman:** The work relating to state karkhanas, stores, ordinance, and communications was considered very important by Mughals and the person dealing with it was called the **Mir Saman.**
- **4. Sadr:** The **Sadr** or **Sadr-i-jahan** was the director of the religious matters, charities and endowments. Sometimes, a higher dignitary called **Vakil**, was also appointed. The Mughals had an efficient administrative system. The famous diwan under Akbar was **Raja Todar Mal**. The Diwan had under him two principal officers, called **Diwan-i-tan** and **diwan-i-khalsa**, who were in charge of salaries and state lands respectively. The organization of public services was based on the **Mansabdari** system. Every important officer of state held a **Mansab** or an official appointment of rank and emoluments. The principal categories of Mughal mansabdars were three –
- Those in command of ten to four hundred were commonly styled **Mansabdars** (officers)
- Those in command of five hundred to twenty-five hundred were **Amirs** (nobles)
- Those in higher ranks belonged to the category of **Umara-i-Kabir or Umara-i-Azim** (grandees).

Each grade carried a definite rate of pay, out of which the holders were required to maintain a quota of horses, elephants, beasts of burden, and carts. The mansabdars were paid either in cash or by temporary grant of *jagirs*. Appointment to the ranks of mansabdars was made by the emperor. In addition to the Mansabdars, there was a class known as **Ahadis**, who were usually young men of good families, who were not fortunate enough to secure a Mansab.

# **The Mughal Provincial Administration**

The Mughal provincial administration was greatly improved under Akbar. The boundaries of the provincial units were more definitely fixed and a uniform administrative pattern was developed. By the introduction **Mansabdars**, liable to be transferred anywhere, the control over the provinces was made more effective.

The principal officer was the Governor, popularly known as **Subahdar** or **Subah**. Next was the provincial **Diwan**, who was in independent charge of the revenues of the province. He was usually a **Mansabdar** of much lower status than the Governor. The next provincial functionary was the **Bakhshi,**  or the paymaster. The **Sadr** and the **Qazi** were entrusted with religious, educational, and judicial duties. The **Faujdar** and the **Kotwal** were the two other important provincial officials. The Faujdar, who was the *administrative head of the sarkar* (district), was appointed by the emperor but was under the supervision and guidance of the governor. The kotwals were not provincial officers, but were appointed by the central government in the provincial capitals and other important cities. The Mughals interfered very little with the local life of the village communities. The **Muqaddam** was normally the sarpanch (head of the village panchayat, or council) who dealt with local disputes, arrange for watch and ward, and performed many functions entrusted to the local bodies.

### **Revenue and Finance**

Tax structure of the Mughal empire was relatively simple. Revenue and expenditure were divided between the central and the provincial government. **Land revenue** was the most important source of income. The principal items of expenditure were defence, the general civil administration of the empire (including the religious organizations) and maintenance of the court and the royal palace.

The *Mughal revenue system* was based on the division of the empire into *subas or governorships, sarkars or districts, and parganas,* consisting of number of villages which were sometimes called **mahals**. The suba was modeled after the central imperial structure. The levy of tax was based on survey settlements calculated after measurement and classification of the cultivated areas. Akbar's revenue system was **raiyatwari**, the revenue amounted to one-third of the produce being collected directly from the individual cultivator.

### **Military Organization**

The Mughal emperors depended upon four different classes of troops. They were–

- The soldiers supplied by the mansabdars.
- Troops under the command of a mansabdar, know as *Dakhili*, who were paid by the state.
- A third class were the **ahadis**, or "*gentlemen troopers*." Drawing higher pay than those in the ordinary service.
- The artillery was paid wholly out of the imperial treasury.
- *The Mughals* had a poor navy. They had no fighting vessels, and the ships that they maintained were only for the commercial operations of the state.

### **Judicial System**

The judicial system of the Mughals was similar to that of the sultanate. Normally no lawyers were allowed to appear. The disputes were speedily settled, often on the basis of equity and natural justice. Many crimes—including murder—were treated as individual grievances rather than crimes against society. The aim of the judicial system was primarily to settle individual complaints and disputes rather than to enforce a legal code, as is indicated by the fact that the criminal court was normally known as the **diwani-mazalim**, the court of complaints.

The judicial courts provided by the Mughals were principally of two types—secular and ecclesiastical. The principal courts for settlement of disputes were presided over by the emperor, the governors, and other executive officers. Akbar used to spend several hours of the day disposing of judicial cases, and governors followed the same procedure in the provinces. In the **Ain-i-Akbari** we find the instructions issued to a governor detailing the judicial procedure he should follow.

Apart from the secular courts and the panchayats, the principal agency for the settlement of disputes was the **qazis' court**. The qazi, being the repository of Muslim law, attended the hearing of cases by the executive authority, whether governor, faujdar or kotwal, and assisted the latter in arriving at a decision consonant with Quaranic precepts. The death penalty normally had to be confirmed by the emperor, but there exceptions of the rule. Capital punishments and mutilations were frequent, and there are records of impaling, dismemberment and other cruel punishments.

### **Important officials**

- 1. Mushrif-i-mumalik Accountant general
- 2. Mustaufi-i-mumalik Auditor general
- 3. Diwan-i-Khalisa
- 4. Diwan-i-tan
- 5. Daroga-i-dak Chauki

# **SHER SHAH (THE SURI EMPIRE)**

Sher Shah was the first muslim ruler of India who displayed a real aptitude for civil government. He gave sound administrative system to India which was followed by many rulers.

In the field of central administration, he followed the Sultanate pattern. There were four departments of central government :

- **1. Diwan-e-Vizarat :** It dealt with financial matters such as collecting taxes and maintaining accounts.
- **2. Diwan-i-arz :** It was headed by *ariz-i-mamalik*. It was a military department.
- **3. Diwan-i-Rasalat :** He added by *Sadr*. It dealt with religious and foreign matter.
- **4. Diwan-i-ensha :** It issued royal orders and conducted correspondence with different parts. According to A.L. Srivastava, there were two more ministers.

- **5. Diwan-i-Barid :** It dealt with the postal system of the empire.
- **6. Diwan-i-Qaza :** After the emperor, he was the chief justice of the empire.

There were two important officials at the sarkar level-

- **1. Shiqdar-i-Shiqadaran :** To maintain law and order.
- **2. Munshife-i-munshifan :** To supervise the revenue.

Land revenue represented a claim on behalf of the state to a share of the crop. Sher Shah settled the land revenue directly with the tillers of the soil and fixed the state demand at one third of the gross produce. *Sikandari Gaja* (32 points) was the measurement of land. He introduced a regular postal service. He issued a large number of silver coins. He improved communications by building roads. He constructed important roads like-

- (i) Grand trunk road from *Sunargaon to Peshawar*.

- (iv) Road from *Mandu to Agra*.

He was also a very fine architect. He built *Purana Qila* in Delhi.

# **ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING MUGHAL PERIOD**

It was policy of the Mughal rulers to encourage trade. The Mughals, especially Akbar, encouraged trade by linking together various parts of the country through an efficient system of roads and abolishing many tolls and duties.

### **Trade and Industry**

Mughal rulers welcomed the foreign traders, provided ample protection and security for their transactions, and levied a very low custom duty (usually no more than 2½% ad valorem). The expansion of local handicrafts and industry in Mughal period resulted in a surplus of export goods. Indian exports consisted of cotton cloth, indigo, saltpetre, spices, opium, sugar, woollen and silk cloth of various kinds, yarn, asafoetida, salt, beads, borax, turmeric, lac, sealing wax, and drugs of various kinds. The principal imports were bullion, horses, luxury goods for the upper classes, like raw silk, coral, amber, precious stones, superior textiles (silk, velvet, brocade, broadcloth), perfumes, drugs, china goods, and European wines.

The manufacture of cotton goods had assumed such extensive proportions that India sent cloth to almost half the world. *The textile industry*, well established in Akbar's day, continued to flourish under his successors. Even the silk *industry*—especially in Bengal—was in flourishing condition. Akbar was responsible for the expansion of silk weaving at *Lahore*, *Agra, Fatehpur-Sikri*, and in *Gujarat*. He opened a large number of factories at important centres, importing master weavers from *Persia*, *Kashmir* and *Turkistan*.

### **Health Facilities**

Public hospitals had been provided in Muslim India, at least since the days of *Firuz Tughluq* (1351–1388), the system seems to have been extended during the Mughal period. Jahangir states in his autobiography that on his accession to the throne he ordered the establishment, at government expense, of hospitals in large cities. That this order was actually made effective is shown by the records of salaries paid by the government and of grants for the distribution of medicine.

### **Social Customs**

The marriage customs of Hindus and Muslims had many similarities. Early marriages were much in vogue amongst the Hindus, with seven considered proper age for a girl to be married. To leave a daughter unmarried beyond twelve years of age was to risk the displeasure of one's caste. The Muslims also betrothed their children between the ages of six and eight, but the marriage was generally not solemnized before they had attained the age of puberty.

# **ARTS & CULTURE DURING MUGHAL PERIOD**

During Mughal period, architects, poets, historians, painters and musicians flourished. The patronage of the Mughal rulers gave a recognizable style and manner to a wide variety of arts.

### **Education**

During Akbar's reign subjects such as *logic*, *philosophy and scholastic theology* had taken on new importance. The standard of learning in these subjects rose as is evidenced by the career of scholars like **Shaikh Abdul Haq Muhaddis** (1551–1642). The extensive study of **hadith** (also **hadis**) began because of contact with Arabia. A number of educational institutions and foundations, including the colleges established by **Ghazi-ud-din Khan Firuz Jang, Sharaf-uddaulah,** and **Raushan-ud-daulah** in Delhi belong to Mughal period.

Later, in the eighteenth century, the *Dars-i-Nizamiya*, named after **Mulla Nizam-ud-din** (d.1748) provided instruction in grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, logic, scholasticism, tafsir (commentary on the Quran), fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), hadith and mathematics. For the students interested in religious studies, there were institutions like **Madrasa-i-Rahimiya**, the forerunner of the modern seminary of Deoband, where *tafsir and hadith* were the principal subjects of study.

Many Muslim women were patrons of literature. The memoirs of **Gulbadan Begum**, *Akbar's aunt*, are well known, and his foster-mother, **Maham Anga**, endowed a college at Delhi. Akbar's wife **Salima Sultana**, the famous Empress **Mumtaz Mahal**, and Aurangzeb's sister, the Princess **Jahan Ara Begum**, were poetesses of note, as was his daughter, **Zeb-un-Nissa**.

## **Literature**

Persian was the language of Mughal intellectual life. A large number of prominent Irani poets, including Urfi, Naziri, Talib, and Kalim, migrated to India, and at times the level of Persian literature was higher in Mughal India than in Iran. **Faizi** (1547–1595) was the brother of Abul Fazl. As Akbar's poet-laureate, his poetry mirrors a triumphant age. **Ghalib** (1796–1869), who was attached to the court of the last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, came under the spell of the immigrant Irani poets—Urfi, Naziri, Zahuri, and Hazin.

Apart from poetry, disciplines of history and biography were most extensively flourished during the Mughal period. Historians include **Abul Fazl** (1551–1602), whose comprehensive Akbar Nama is one of the most important historical works produced in India. **Badauni** (1540–1615), was a consummate artist, a master of the telling phrase, and capable of evoking a living picture with a few deft strokes. *Babur's autobiography*, originally written in Turkish, but soon translated into Persian by

## **Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khana**.

**Hindi** was the next language which received patronage at Mughal court. The practice started by Akbar of having a Hindi **kavi rai** (poet-laureate) along with the Persian **malik-ul-shuara**. The greatest Hindi poet of Akbar's days was **Tulasidas**. *Raja Birbal* (1528–1583) was the kavi rai, but the works of Akbar's famous general **Abdul Rahim** have been better preserved. A skillful writer in Hindi, Abdul Rahim furthered the development of the language.

Mughal rulers patronized *Bengali, Kashmiri, Hindi, Deccani, and other regional languages*. This trend was most powerful in the regional kingdoms which grew up after the weakening of the Delhi Sultanate. The establishment of a well-organized central government at Delhi resulted in greater linguistic unification, and the influence of Persian became far more dominant. Mughal rule indirectly assisted the regional literatures.

# **Architecture**

Architecture reached the pinnacle under the Mughal rulers. After India's conquest, Babur summoned from Constantinople pupils of the great Ottoman architect **Sinan**, to whom he entrusted the construction buildings. The buildings constructed by him exhibit no trace of local influence and are distinctly foreign.

Akbar's most ambitious project was his new capital at *Fatehpur Sikri*, the seat of the imperial court from 1569 to 1584. Some of the buildings there are dominated by the Hindu style of architecture, but Persian influences were equally strong in his day, as can be seen in the magnificent tomb for Humayun built in 1569 at Delhi. Akbar built two major fortresses at Agra and Lahore. **The Lahore fort**, which was built on the banks of the Ravi, at about the same time as that at Agra, was planned and constructed on practically the same grand scale.

Akbar's successor, Jahangir, was interested less in architecture than in painting and gardens. During Jahangir's reign a number of gardens were built, such as the **Shalimar Bagh** and the **Nishat Bagh** in Kashmir. Jahangir's beautiful mausoleum at Shahdara near Lahore was completed by his widow Nur Jahan.

**Shah Jahan** was the greatest builder amongst the Mughals. The style of Shah Jahan's principal edifices is basically Persian, but is distinguished by use of *white marble*, minute and tasteful decoration—particularly the open-work tracery which ornaments the finest buildings, giving them their distinctive elegance. Among the more famous of his buildings are the **Pearl Mosque** and the **Taj Mahal** at *Agra*, the **Red Fort** and **Jama Masjid** at *Delhi*, palaces and gardens at Lahore, a beautiful mosque at *Thatta in Sind* and many edifices at Ajmer and Ahmadabad.

## **Painting**

Humayun is credited for the founding of the Mughal school of painting. He persuaded **Khwaja Abdul Samad** and **Mir Sayyid Ali**, the pupil of **Behzad**, to join his court at Kabul in 1550. They accompanied him to Delhi, forming the nucleus of the *Mughal school*.

In the reign of Akbar, many painters were granted ranks as **mansabdars** or **ahadis**. The painters worked in a large building at *Fatehpur Sikri*, and, according to Abul Fazl, "the works of all painters are weekly laid before His Majesty by the *daroghas* (supervisors) and the clerks; he then confers rewards according to the excellence of workmanship or increases the monthly salaries.

**Khwaja Abdul Samad** was the head of the establishment and was known by the title of **shirin qalam** (or "sweet pen"), referring to his skill in calligraphy. Later he became master of the mint (1577) and subsequently was appointed **diwan** at Multan.

Akbar's traditions were maintained by Jahangir. The main remnants of Jahangir's principal picture albums are in the *State Library of Berlin*, while another album, which was taken away by Nadir Shah during his sack of Delhi, is in the *Imperial Library at Tehran*.

## **Music**

Most Mughal emperors patronized music. There were nearly forty prominent musicians who flourished at Akbar's court. These artists came from *Gwalior*, *Malwa, Tabriz* (in Iran) and *Kashmir*. The most famous musician of the period was **Tansen**. According to some Muslim *chroniclers*, he was brought up in the hospice of **Shaikh Mohammad Ghaus** of *Gwalior*, but Hindu tradition

describes him as a disciple of **Swami Haridas**. The variety of music most extensively cultivated at Akbar's court was the ancient **dhrupad**. The same tradition was continued by **Bilas Khan**, the inventor of *bilas todi*. Music received great encouragement under Shah Jahan. He had thirty prominent musicians at his court. The **khiyal**, or *ornate school of music* was beginning to assert itself in his reign.

## **Decline of the Empire**

Aurangzeb's death in 1706 caused the rapid decline of Mughal empire. The governor of Hyderabad, Bengal and Avadh established independent kingdoms and the Marathas reorganised under a new system of government.
