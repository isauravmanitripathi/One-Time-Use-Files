# **INDIAN FREEDOM 18 STRUGGLE**

# Introduction

The national movement in India started in the second half of the nineteenth century. As we already know that the English had come to India to trade and make profits. So the East India Company came to enhance the profit of Indian possessions as well as to maintain and strengthen its powers. However, sporadic uprisings with a motive of driving British out of India had started a century earlier. The cumulative effect of British expansionist policies, economic exploitation and administrative innovations over the years had adversely affected the position of all rulers of Indian states, sepoys, zamindars, peasants, traders, etc. excepting of course, the western educated class who owned their 'position' to the company's government. The Indian rulers were not united. They were selfish and guided by self-interest. There was no feeling of nationalism. The British had superior weapons and military tactics. Thus the British were successful in subjugating the whole of India.

**Chapter**

Such a feeling of growing discontent, got its manifestation in several civil rebellions, tribal uprisings and sepoy mutinies during the colonical rule. There were also violent religio-political uprisings and disturbances, which were anti-British. Of all uprisings in the 19th century, the Revolt of 1857 was the most important as it was the first major challenge to the British domination. It was a watershed in the history of British rule in India, shook the very foundation of the British empire in India. It also changed the character of British rule, marking the end of the rule of the East India Company and bringing British India directly under the British Crown.

# **REVOLTS**

### **Indigo Revolt or Blue Rebellion**

Thousands of ryots refused to grow Indigo in Bengal in 1859 AD. The English had established the monopoly production of Indigo by capturing land in Bengal and Bihar. In 1860, the peasants of Patna and Nadia districts refused to pay rents to the planters and attacked factories. The rebels here supported by local zamindars and village headmen.

**Ashley Eden,** the lieutenant governor of Bengal tried to appease the ryots and issued an order by which no ryots would be forced to accept the contract. After the rebel, the plantation of Indigo was shifted from Bengal to Bihar. In Champaran, the workers revolted in Bihar. In Champaran, the workers revolted in 1867-68 and later in 1917 in the leadership of **Mahatma Gandhi.**

There was a strong demonstration against the cultivation of indigo in Champaran (Bihar) in 1866-68. The indigo crisis continued till the beginning of the 20th century when M. K. Gandhi had intervened in favour of the indigo cultivators. And finally, after his intervention the long pending problem got some solution.

### **Adivasis Movement**

In 1772, the Paharia Revolt broke out followed by five years uprising led by **Tilka Manjhi**. The Tomar and Munda revolts occurred. In the next twenty years, various revolts occurred in Singhbhumi, Gumla, Birbhumi, Bankura, Manbhoomi and Palamu followed by the Kol uprising in 1832 and the Khewar and Bhunji revolts in 1832 to 1834.

### **Khasi Uprising**

**'**Khasi' is a tribal community which lives in the region between Garo and Jaintia Hills. Khasi uprising of 1783 was in protest of East India Company's effort to built a road link between Brahmaputra Valley and Sylhet. The leaders of this revolution were Tirath Singh and Ganga Singh. This uprising developed into a popular revolt during British rule. By 1833, the revolt was suppressed by English military action.

### **Pagal Panthi Uprising**

Pagal Panth was a semi-religious sect which had influence in the northern districts of Bengal. Karan Singh was its founder and Tipu Shah was successor of this movement. Tipu Shah took up the cause of the peasants against atrocities and oppression by Zamindars. Tipu captured Sherpur in 1825 and assumed royal power. This uprising crushed with the help of army in 1833.

### **Ahom Revolt**

Gomadhar Konwar leaded this revolt. This revolt broke out in Assam. The British had promised to withdraw from Assam after First Burma War (1824-26), but instead of withdrawing the British attempted to annex Ahom's territory in the Company's dominion. As a result of the rebellion the company was forced to hand over Upper Assam to Maharaja Purandar Singh Narendra and part of kingdom was restored to the Assamese King.

# **Santhal Revolt**

The Santhal hul or santhal revolt of 1855-56 was held against the permanent settlement of Lord Cornwallis. **Sindhu and Kanhu Murmu** were the leaders of the revolt in which thousands of Santhals took part. A forest regulation was passed in 1878 which imposed restrictions upon adivasis. The act divided the forest lands in India into three categories - reserved, protected and unclassified. The act changed the traditional rights of adivasis on the forest and forest became state property.

In 1914, Jatra Oraon started Tana Bhagat Movement and 25,000 adivasis joined the movement. The Khasis living in Assam and Meghalaya revolted against the British.

### **Pabna Uprising**

**"Pabna Uprising"** was a movement by the peasants against landlords in the Pabna districts of Yusufzahi Paragana of East Bengal in 1872. In 1873, an **Agrarian League** was formed by Ishan Chandra Roy, Shabhu Pal and Khoodi Mallah. Peasants refused to pay enhanced rents of land and fought against zamindars in the court. The discontent of peasants continued till 1885 when the Government enhanced occupancy rights by the **"Bengal Act of 1885".**

### **Munda Rebellion**

**Birsa Munda** started revolt against the British policies. Zamindars and moneylenders were exploiting the Adivasis. Munda rebellion resulted in the **Chotanagpur Tenancy Act of 1908**. It banned forced labour and assured local customary land rights to the tribals.

For more than three decades the Munda Sardars had been fighting against destruction of their system of common land holdings by the jagirdars, thikadars and money lenders. The revolt of the Munda took place during 1899 - 1900 under the leadership of Birsa Munda who mobilized his followers on religious and political grounds. In 1899, Birsa declared a revolt to establish Munda rule in the land by billing thikadars, jagirdars, Rajas, Hakims and Christians. For this he congregated force of 6,000 Mundas. He was, however, captured in February 1900 and died in jail in June.

### **Civil and Tribal uprisings**

**Sanyasi Revolt:** The British rule in Bengal after 1757 brought a new economic order which spelt ruin on Zamindars, peasants and artisans alike. The famine of 1770 and the insensibility on the part of the company was regarded to be the main cause of alien rule. The restriction imposed on visits to holy places alienated the sanyasis. The Sanyasis in retaliation started attacking on the company's factories and state treasuries. **Warren Hastings** could contain these sanyasi raids only after massive millitary actions.

**Khonds rising :** Khonds the tribal people of Orissa first revolted in 1846 and then in 1855. They were led by **Chakra Bisoi**. They were suppressed with great difficulty by the British.

**Movement of Frontier Tribes:** The other region to have witnessed tribal movements of considerable proportion was the north-eastern frontier. The region differed substantially from the rest of tribal India in two basic aspects. Here the tribals formed an overwhelming majority and thus were relatively economically and socially secure.

The factors that led to a different typology being suggested for the tribal movements along the frontier from that of the nonfrontier tribes were:

- (a) Religous and social reform movements.
- (b) Movements for separate statehood within the Indian union or more autonomy for tribal areas
- (c) Insurgency and
- (d) Assertion of cultural rights.

**Tribal Movements, 1935-47 :** Factors contributing to the development of a sense of larger tribal identity were

- (a) The Government of India Act 1935
- (b) The rise of modern education and

(c) Gradual emergence of a small educated middle class among the tribes of the hills and plains.

World War II, during which these hills had become 'important' theatres of war, had penetrated their isolation due to world events. Many tribals feared that their cherished ancient laws, customs and village organisations would be destroyed by non-tribal rulers after independence. At the time of independence there were two major political trends among the frontier tribes. The first was in favour of asserting more tribal autonomy within the Indian Union. The second trend was towards complete independence for tribal areas. Its protagonists were the **Naga Nationalist Council**, **the United Mizo Freedom Organisation and the Mizo National Front.**

### **Mopla Revolt**

In 1921, the **Mopla** rebelled in **Malabar** region. The Mopla peasants were Muslims but the landlords were Hindus. Excessive land revenue demands, extra cesses and insecurity of land tenures were reason of rebel.

# **The Trade Union Movement**

The trade union movement in India originated due to different reasons –

- 1. The poor working conditions in Indian factories.
- 2. The condition of industries and mines was poor.
- 3. Wages of workers were very low.
- 4. Realisation among leaders to protect the interest of workers.
- 5. Economic distress
- 6. Set up of International labour organization.

The first factory commission was set up in Bombay in 1875 followed by the **First Factory Act of 1881** which aimed at prohibiting child labour. The **All India Trade Union Congress**

(AITUC) was established by **N.M. Joshi** in 1920. The Trade Union Act of 1926 established trade unions as legal bodies to protect the right of registration and privileges of the workers. The British appointed a royal commission, the **Whitely Commission** in 1928. It consisted 11 members out of which 6 were Indians. They visited India in 1929.

#### **It included –**

- 1. Adoption of policy of standard wages in Bombay cotton mills and jute mills of Bengal.
- 2. Development of trade unions.
- 3. To settle disputes, officers were appointed.
- 4. Time and piece workers were included.

### **The Wahabi Movement**

It was named after **Abdul Wahab**. It was a religious movement and aimed at the restoration of Muslim powers and fighting against the British and the Sikhs. The Wahabi movement was suppressed by the British government in 1870.

### **Sepoy Mutinies**

There were several mutinies took place before the 1857 revolt. The 47th Native Infantry revolted in 1824. There were mutinies in 1825 in Assam, in 1838 in Sholapur, in 1844 in Sindh and in 1849 to 59 in Punjab.

# **THE 1857 REVOLT**

According to **P.E. Roberts**, "The Revolt of 1857 was just a sepoy mutiny and it arose due to cartridges with fats."

According to **V.D. Savarkar**, "The Revolt of 1857 was the first war of India's independence, the great rebellion, the Indian mutiny.

These sections of the country were responsible for the revolt in 1857 –

- 1. Rulers
- 2. Peasants
- 3. Soldiers

Missionaries.

4. Common people

Through the Doctrine of Lapse, the British brought a number of kingdoms under its control. Queen of Jhansi **Lakshmibai, Nana Saheb**, the son of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao II and **Begum Hazrat Mahal**, the queen of Awadh opposed this policy.

Due to commercialization of the agriculture peasants were compelled to grow cash crops. They had to pay very high taxes. There was no hope for improvement of the fertility of land.

The Indian soldiers were unhappy with the Britishers as they were not given high position in the army. Apart from this reason, they were also not content with the policy of British government regarding the overseas jobs and the remuneration. Common people were forced to accept the religion of Christian

# **Causes of the Revolt**

#### **1. Political Causes:**

- (i) Growing suspicion among native rulers over Lord Dalhousie's policies of Doctrine of Lapse' and annexation of the territories of native rulers;
- (ii) Annexation of Avadh on the ground of 'misgovernance';
- (iii) Disposing of Nawab Wazid Ali Shah, the reigning ruler of Avadh;
- (iv) Absentee 'soverigntyship' of the British in India;
- (v) Lord Canning's announcement that Mughals would lose the titles of Kings and be mere princes; and
- (vi) disbanding of the Pindaris and irregular soldiers who constituted a large section among the army ranks.

#### **2. Administrative and Economic Causes:**

- (i) Inefficient and prejudiced administrative machinery of the company;
- (ii) Rampant corruption;
- (iii) Racialism in civil and military administration;
- (iv) Deprivation of the traditional ruling classes of their luxury due to the establishment of the company's suzerainty over the Indian states;
- (v) Introduction of new land revenue system which snatched the land from the cultivator and gave it to moneylender or traders or new aristocrats, and
- (vi) De-industrialisation of the country.

### **3. Military Causes:**

- (i) Displeasure of Indian sepoys with alien rule;
- (ii) Compulsion of the sepoys to serve at the cantonments;
- (iii) Withdrawal of free postage facility to sepoys following the enactment of Post-Office Act of 1856 which necessitated them to serve beyond the seas;
- (iv) Debarring the foreign service allowance or batta for Sepoys serving in Sindh and Punjab, and
- (v) Racial discrimination.

#### **4. Social and Religious Causes:**

- (i) Social discrimination of the British against Indians;
- (ii) Spread of Christainity through missionaries;
- (iii) Missionaries' attempt to conversion to Christainity;
- (iv) Enactment of the Religious Disabilities Act 1850, which enabled a convert to inherit his ancestral property; and
- (v) Antagonism of the traditional Indian society due to the law prohibiting sati, child marriage and female infanticide.
- **5. The Immediate Cause:** The Government introduced a new Enfield rifle in the Army. Its cartridges had greased paper cover which had to be bitten off before the cartridge was loaded into the rifle. It was believed that the grease was composed of beef and pig fat. The Hindu as well as Muslim sepoys were enraged because the use of greased cartridges was against their religion and they feared that the government was deliberately trying to destroy their religion and convert them to Christainity. This issue is said to have agitated both Hindu and Muslim soldiers.

# **Spread of the Revolt**

The Revolt was sparked off on **March 29, 1857** when a section of Indian Soldiers of the 19th and 34th Native Infantry posted at **Barrackpur** near Calcutta mutinied and a Brahmin soldier, **Mangal Pandey**, killed the British army oficers, the regiment was disbanded and Pandey executed. At Meerut, in May 1857, 85 sepoys of the 3rd Cavalry regiment on their refusal to use the greased cartridges were court martialled and were sentenced to long term imprisonment. On 10th May, 1857, the sepoys broke out in open rebellion, shot their officers, released their fellow sepoys and headed towards Delhi with the cry **'Delhi Chalo'.**

Delhi was seized by the rebels on 12 May, 1857. **Bahadur Shah II** was proclaimed the Emperor of India. Delhi became the centre of revolt and Bahadur Shah was its symbol. Very soon the rebellion spread to Lucknow, Allahabad, Kanpur, Bareilly, Benaras, in parts of Bihar, Jhansi and other places. In many Indian states, the rulers remained loyal to British Government but their soldiers revolted. South India remained practically undisturbed.

Kanpur was captured by the rebels on 5th June, 1857. **Nana Sahib** was proclaimed the Peshwa, General Sir Hugh Wheeler commanding the station surrendered on 27 June. At Kanpur Nana Sahib was joined by his able Lieutenant Tantia Tope and Azimullah. Later on, Kanpur was captured by Campbell on December 6, 1857.

The revolt of Lucknow was led by the **Begum Hazrat Mahal**, who declared her son **Birjis Kadir** as the Nawab of Awadh. Helped by the sepoys at Lucknow and the Zamindars and peasants of Awadh, the begum organised in all out attack on the British. Sir Henry Lawrance was killed during the course of the residency. Later on, General Outram and Hemelock force their way into the residency. They were also besieged but later on were relieved.

**Laxmibai of Jhansi** joined the rebels when the British refused to acknowledge her right to adopt a heir to the gaddi of Jhansi. On June 4, 1858, Rani Laxmibai was proclaimed the head of the state and she provided spirited lead to the rebels and fought heroically against the British forces. She and her companion **Tantia Tope** made the most imaginative and heroic resolve to capture Gwalior. Maharaja Scindia tried to fight against Rani of Jhansi, but most of his troops deserted to her and he took refuge at Agra. Rani of Jhansi died fighting on 17th June, 1858. At Bareilly, **Khan Bahadur Khan** had proclaimed himself the Nawab Nizam. In Bihar a local Zamindar **Kunwar Singh**

raised the banner of revolt.

The British Governor general mobilized all his forces and hanged thousands of people. The revolt was suppressed by the British.

# **Effects of the Revolt**

- 1. A new Act was passed in 1858 by which the power of EEIC was shifted to British crown. A secretary of State for India was appointed. The title of **viceroy** was given to **the governor general**. The British army was reorganized in India.
- 2. Hindus and Muslims became united against the British government.
- 3. Policies were made to protect zamindars and landlords.
- 4. Religious and social practices of India were decided to be

respected by the British.

5. They gave assurance to the rulers of different provinces that their provinces won't be annexed further. But British crown would be their original sovereign.

### **Failure of the Revolt**

- Lack of coordination and central leadership.
- Revolt lacked a forward-looking programme, coherent ideology, a political perspective or a vision of the future society and economy.
- Rebel leaders lacked resources and experiences as compared to British.
- Revolt lacked the support of martial races of the north.
- British power had remained intact in the Eastern, western and southern parts of India from where the forces were sent to suppress the revolt.
- Limited territorial and social base.

# **Impact of the Revolt**

Even though the revolt of 1857 ended in failure yet it had shuddered the British rule in India from its very foundation. It was the first great and direct threat to British rule in India. That was why, aftermath of the revolt, the British troops did inhuman atrocities upon the Indian people. Thousands of rebels were executed publicly after a mock trial.

The revolt of 1857 brought about fundamental changes in the character of British administration. Some of these were:

- (a) The Queen's Proclamation
- (b) Pursuing the policy of divide and rule
- (c) Reorganisation of British army
- (d) The Act for the better government of India 1858 was passed etc.

# **Features of the Revolt of 1857**

- The Revolt inspired the people of India to imbibe the spirit of selfless services and patriotism.
- It produced many heroes like *Rani Lakshmibai* and *Tantia Tope*.
- It gave *patriotism* to future generations people.
- It made Indians aware of the *true nature* of the British.
- The *participation* of common people, rulers, soldiers, students and others gave the revolt its popular character.
- Many people and rulers whose survival threatened were drawn into the revolt.

# **NATIONAL MOVEMENT**

# **Rise of Nationalist Movement**

The foundation of the nationalist movement had been laid by the end of the 19th century. The main target of this movement was to face the challenge of foreign supremacy. Its effects were the socio-religion reform movement, the spread of modern western education, the emergence of the middle class and the economic consequences of the British rule. The politicial awareness that these trends gave birth to the concept of '*nationhood*' and '*nationalist aspirations*'. In the wake of this political consciousness various political association were founded, particularly in the Presidency towns, to organise the English-educated classes to plead for a more or less common programme of political progress. The culmination of this trend was the foundation of the *Indian National Congress in 1885*, which marks the formal beginning of the organised nationalist movement, to drive out the foreigners from the country. All classes of people in India joined at one stage and played their part in the freedom struggle.

### **Some of the high points of this struggle were:**

- (1) Foundation of the Indian National Congress and its first twenty years (1885 - 1905) - the moderate phase.
- (2) The rise of neo-nationalism or Extremism, the Swadeshi movement and the first phase of Revolutionary Terrorism (1905-15)

# **Factor responsible for the National Movement**

We may list the following factors which created discontent among the people of India and brought the Indian on the same platform against British rule.

- (1) Economic causes;
- (2) Political causes;
- (3) Social -religious causes;
- (4) Unified system of administration;
- (5) Development of the means of communication;
- (6) Growth of western thought and education;
- (7) Development of vernacular languages;
- (8) Growth of a modern press;
- (9) Art and literature;
- (10) Racial arrogance of the rulers; and
- (11) Immediate factors of provocation under the Viceroy Ripon, especially the Ilbert Bill controversy.

# **Rise of political ideas and Political Association (Upto 1885)**

British Supremacy in India created certain forces as a result of its direct and indirect consequences which eventually challenged the British imperialism. One important effect of the initiation of western culture in India was the growth of modern political concepts like nationalism, nationality, political rights etc. The Indian sub-continent witnessed the growth of political ideas and political organisation hitherto unknown to the Indian World. This was the reason why political associations heralded 19th century modern politics into India.

Several public associations were began. In 1866, *Dadabhai Naoroji* organised the East India Association to discuss the Indian question and to influence British to promote Indian welfare. Later, he organised branches of the Association, in prominent Indian cities.

# **Bangbhasha Prakasika Sabha**

Founded in 1836, it was first organized political association of India. It worked for reform of administrative association of Indians with the British, spread of education, putting forward Indian demands to the British parliament. Raja Ram Mohan Roy was pioneer in political movement in India. The 'Sabha' was established by associates of Raja Rammohan Roy.

### **British India Society**

British India Society was founded in 1839 in England with efforts of William Adam who was a friend or Raja Rammohan Roy. The Society organised meeting at several place to create awareness of the condition in India. In 1841, the society started a newspaper "British Indian Advocate."

# **Bengal British India Society**

With efforts of George Thomson, alongwith Dwarkanath Tagore, Chandra Mohan Chatterjee and Parmananda Maitra; 'Bengal British Society was founded on 20th April 1843. The idea behind this set-up was to secure the welfare and advancement of all classes in loyalty to the government of the reigning sovereign of the British dominions.

### **East India Association**

This organisation was established by "The grand old man" of Indian National Movement Dadabhai Naoroji. It was a platform for discussing matters and ideas about India, and to provide representation for discussing matters and ideas about India and to provide representation for the Indians to the Government. Naoroji delivered first lecture to the association on 2nd may 1867. The 'Associations's' first president was *Lord Lyveden*.

# **India League**

Founder editor of "*Amrit Bazaar Patrika*", Sisir Kumar Ghose, along with a few progressive leaders of the time, founded the "*India League*" in year 1875 in Calcutta. The basic aim of the 'League' was to represent masses and to stimulate a sense of nationalism among the people. Later, the 'League' was superseded by the "*India Association*", founded in year 1876 with active participation from Anand Mohan Bose, and S.N. Banerjee. 'Indian Association' raised voice against issues like age limit for ICS examination and opposed 'Ilbert Bill'.

### **Poona Sarvjanik Sabha**

On 2nd April, 1870 Poona Sarvajanik Sabha was founded by M.G. Ranade and G.V. Joshi. The 'Sabha' provided many prominent leaders of national stature like 'Bal Gangadhar Tilak'. It aimed to serve as a mediating body between British Government and people of India. In 1875, "Sabha' submitted a petition to the '*House of Commons*' to demand India's representation in British Parliament.

### **Madras Mahajan Sabha**

It was established by S. Ramaswami Mudaliar and P. Anandacharlu in year 1884 in Madras. The Sabha in collaboration with '*Bombay Presidency Association*' and the '*Indian Assocation*' sent a delegation to England.

# **INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS**

The foundation of Indian National Congress in 1885 was not a sudden event. It was the culmination of political awakening. It was an all India level organisation aimed at certain basic tasks and objectives. *A.O. Hume* was the founder of Indian National Congress. *First INC meeting* was held at the *Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College* on 28th December, 1885. *W.C. Banerjee* was elected its first president and was attended by 72 delegates. It aimed at the development of close relations between national workers. The second session of INC met at Calcutta in December 1886 under the presidentship of Dadabhai Naoroji. 436 delegates participated in this meeting.

Formation of Congress as a body for freedom struggle, highlights its characteristics as one of the oldest and biggest democratic organization in the world.

### **Aims and Objectives of Congress:**

- Promotion of friendship amongst the countrymen.
- Development of consolidation of feeling of national unity irrespective of race, caste, religion or provinces.
- Formulation of popular demands and presentation before the government through petitions.
- Training and organization of public opinion.
- Consolidation of sentiments of national unity.
- Recording of the opinions of educated classes on pressing problems
- Laying down lines for future course of action in public interest.

### **Role of Congress**

- Early congress leaders showed their concern for removal of poverty from India, a resolution highlighting improvement of India.
- Annual sessions of Congress took place in different venues every year.
- Provincial conferences were organized so as to foster countrywide involvement.
- Congress took important steps so as to organise public opinion in Great Britain in favour of Indian viewpoint.
- Congress gave thrust on seeking representation in government. It was Madan Mohan Malviya who commented no taxation without representation.
- In 1872 *Dadabhai Naoroji* became a member of British Parliament.
- By *Indian Council Act of 1892*, indirect elections were introduced for the first time for a credit also goes to INC.
- Congress demanded fiscal suspension from British Government.
- Congress demanded Indianization of Civil services.
- It also protested against economic emasculaton of India.
- INC also protested against insensitivity shown by government to natural disasters including famines, plague and floods in India. That is why in 1896 it passed a resolution blaiming British rule for famines in India.
- Mahatma Gandhi appeared on Congress platform of the first time in 1901, Culcutta session, seeking support for Indian struggle in South Africa and the session was Presided by *Dinolaw Wacha*.
- It was in 1905 that a resolution was passed seeking introduction of socialistic pattern of society. Apart from resolution for introducing concept of economic and social reconstruction.

### **Understanding 'Safety Valve Theory'**

The 'Safety Value Theory' is based on seven volumes of secret report which A.O. Hume, the founder of the Congress, read at Simla in 1878. The theory was first mentioned in Hume's biography, written by *William Wedderburn* and published in 1913. According to this theory, the British wanted the formation of an organization which could save the administration from possible political outburst in the country. That is why they provided ample support to A.O. Hume and other Indian intelligentsia in the formation of the Indian National Congress.

**The First Congress Session:** A. O. Hume along with the cooperation of Indian leaders organised the first session of the Indian National Congress at *Bombay* in the hall of the Gokuldas Tejpal Sanskrit College in December 1885. There were four main demands put forward by the Congress at its first session:

- (a) A simultaneous examination for the ICS to be held in England and India;
- (b) Reform of legislative council and adoption of the principle of election in place of nomination in constituting them;
- (c) Opposition to the annexation of upper Burma; and
- (d) Reduction in the military expenditure.

### **The Moderates (1885 - 1905)**

The moderates were the first in the 19th century to develop an economic critique of colonialism. This critique was perhaps the most important contribution to the development of the national movement in India. They pointed out that a large part of India's capital and wealth was being drained to Britain in the form of salaries and pensions to British Civil and military officials working in India.

Moderate leaders believed in constitutional medium of struggle. That is why, radicalism of direct action was absent from their struggle. Their achievement lies in the fact that they were architect of first all India politics forum. It fostered sense of political unity and spirit of togetherness in Indians for making of India as nation.

# **Methods of Political work**

- Moderate congressmen believed in a peaceful and constitutional agitation
- Prayers and petitions were the media.
- Congress sessions survived only for 3 days a year. It had no channel to carry on the work in the interval.
- They had faith in goodness of the British nation and were sure that all would be well if the British could be familiarised with the true state of affair in India.
- In 1889, a British Committee of INC was formed.

**Role of Masses:** The basic weakness of the moderates lay in their narrow social base. Their movement did not have a wide appeal. In fact, the leaders lacked political trust in the masses. The area of their action was limited to the urban community. As they did not have the support of the masses, they declared that the time was not ripe for throwing out a challenge to the foreign rulers. Their programmes and policies championed the cause of all sections of the Indian people and represented nation-wide interests against colonial exploitation.

### **Main objectives and Demands of the INC (1885 - 1905)**

In the early years, the INC also suffered from a blinkered convinction in the essential sense of justice and goodness of the British people. they deluded themselves that all would be well if the British people could be acquainted with the true state of affairs. They had an equally deep rooted belief that the Indian nation was one and that its suffering arose from the discriminatory behavioiur of sundry bureaucrats. The resolutions passed at various Congress sessions reflected these twin factors. They were roughly similar from one session to the next, and they dealt with three broad types of grievances, namely political, administrative and economic.

# **About INC**

- Aurobindo Ghosh called INC as "begging institute".
- Bipin Chandra Pal viewed "INC playing with bubble".
- Tilak, the Father of Indian Unrest said "INC distinguished between begging and claiming the rights".
- Tilak also said, "Rights are not begged, they are claimed".
- Even Jawaharlal Nehru observes the early Congress to be "an English knowing upper class affairs".

### **Rise of the Extremism**

The moderate policies of the early Congress disillusioned many of its younger leaders, known as *Neo-nationalists* or *Extremists*. By their painstaking studies and writings, the early nationalist leaders had exposed the true nature of British rule in India. Dadabhai Naoroji, exposed the exploitative nature of British rule in India and proved that Britain was 'bleeding India white' and the constant 'drain of wealth' from India was directly responsible for India's economic miseries.

The new turn in Indian politics found expression in two forms-

- (i) The formation of the Extremist group within the Congress,
- (ii) the growth of Terrorism or Revolutionary movement in the country at large.

Four prominent Congress leaders - *Lokamanya Tilak*, *Bipin Chandra Pal*, *Aurobindo Ghose* and *Lala Lajpat Rai* - defined the creed of the new group, gave articulate to its aspirations and guided its operations. Tilak gave the slogan to the new group when he said, "*Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it*".

It should be clearly understood that the demand for Swaraj by extremists was demand for complete freedom from British rule and full independence to manage national affairs without any foreign control. The swaraj of the moderate leaders was merely a demand for colonial self-government within the Empire.

- The methods applied by the two groups were different in their modulation and approach. The extremists had no trust in the generosity of the British public or parliament, nor were they convinced of the power of merely holding conference.
- The extremists also affirmed their worry in passive resistance, mass agitation and strong will to suffer or make self-sacrifices. The new leadership sought to create an ardent love for liberty, accompanied by a spirit of sacrifice and readiness to suffer for the cause of the country.
- They tried to root out from the people's mind the power of the British rulers and gave them self-reliance and confidence in their own strength.
- They had full confidence in the strength of the masses and they planned to achieve swaraj through mass action.
- They, therefore, pressed for political work among the masses and for direct political action by the masses.
- The extremists urged boycott of the foreign goods use of Swadeshi goods, national education and passive resistance.

The torch of extremism was lit by Tilak who used religious orthodoxy to arouse national consciousness. He was the first to give the slogan of "*Swarajya, Swadesh and Boycott*" and wrote in his paper Kesari, "*Our nation is like a tree, of which the original trunk was swarajya and the branches were Swadeshi and Boycott*."

The three pillars of extremism were '*Lal, Bal and Pal*' (*Lala Lajpat Rai, Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal*) who became the ideals of future nationalists. They launched a vehement attack on the British Government.

**Partition of Bengal (1905 AD.)** In Bengal the nationalist feelings and anti British movement arose. Lord Curzon played the policy of *Divide and Rule*, to crush nationalism. The government separated East Bengal which was dominated by the Muslims and merged it with Assam instead of spreading non - Bengali areas from the province of Bengal. Both radicals and moderates opposed it.

The condition for the appearance of millitant nationalism had thus, developed when in 1905 the partition of Bengal was declared and the Indian national movement, entered its second phase.

- On 20th July, 1905, Lord Curzon issued an order dividing the province of Bengal into two parts: Eastern Bengal and Assam with a population of 31 million and rest of Bengal with a population of 54 million of whom 18 million were Bengalis, and 36 million Biharis and Oriyas.
- Although the main argument supported by the Government in favour of the partition was that the existing province of Bengal was too big to be efficiently administered by a single provincial government, the real motive was to curb the growth of national feeling in politically advanced Bengal by making a gulf between the Bengali speaking Hindus and Muslims, and destroying the unity of 78 millions of Bengalis by dividing them into two groups.
- The Indian National Congress and the nationalists of Bengal strongly opposed the partition. They realised the principal motive behind the partition was the destruction of the unity of the Bengalis on religious grounds. They could not but feel that the partition was a measure intentionally adopted to ignite enmity and hostility between the Hindus and Muslims, the two great communities in Bengal.
- An anti partition agitation was initiated on 7th August, 1905 at the Town Hall, Calcutta, where a massive demonstration against the partition was organised.
- 16th October, 1905 was the day fixed for the coming into force of partition and after a month, Lord Curzon left India.
- 16th October, 1905 was declared to be a day of national mourning throughout Bengal. It was observed as a day of fasting. There was a hartal in Calcutta. People went to the Ganges barefooted in the early hours of the morning and took their bath.
- *• Rabindranath Tagore* composed a national song, '*Amar Sonar Bangla*', for this occassion which was sung by huge crowds parading the streets.
- There were cries of 'Bande Mataram' which became a national song of Bengal.
- The ceremony of Raksha Bandhan was observed on 16th October, 1905. Hindus and Muslims tried rakhi on one

another's wrists as a symbol of the unbreakable unity.

**Muslim league** The Muslim League was founded in 1906 at Dacca. It demanded for the separate electorate for Muslims. This demand was later included in the Government India Act 1909.

In 1907, the congress split due to differences that arose between the moderates and extremists.

# **MAJOR MOVEMENT ACTS, COMMISSION AND PARTIES**

# **The Swadeshi Movement**

To oppose the partition of Bengal the Indian leaders initiated the *Swadeshi* and *Boycott Movement* in August 7, 1905. To offer more active resistance, it was decided to Boycott British goods. This was the beginning of the Swadeshi movement, which within a few years transformed the Indian political scene. Bonfires of British cloth demonstrated the people's determination not to rely on foreign products. It gave a tremendous impetus to Indian industry, an open challenge to the British authority. This swadeshi movement was an immense success.

### **Main effect of Swadeshi Movement**

Swadeshi movement was stepping stone of Nationalist movement, which led to the beginning of organized political movement in India.

- Rise of Neo-nationalism
- Surat split
- Boycott of foreign goods.
- Cultural revival and emergence of nationalist art and literature.
- Concept of national education.

### **Movement under Extremists (1905 - 08)**

- Led by Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lajpat Rai and Aurobindo Ghosh.
- The political extremists, demanded self-government for India, not under British control or British superiority, But by severing all British connections, and wiping off British influences.

# **Morley Minto Reforms or Indian Council Act, 1909**

This reform named after Morley, the secretary of state and Minto, the viceroy at that time. The principle of separate electorate for Hindus and the Muslims was legalized. The Home Rule Movement was started due to the Congress inactivity after 1907 and disappointment with the Act of 1909. During this period Tilak gave the famous slogan, "*Swaraj is my birthright and I will have it*."

# **Communalism**

Communalism is the belief that in India Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians form different and distinct communities. Inherent in communalism is the second perception that the social, cultural, economic and political interests of the followers of one religion are dissimilar and divergent from the interest of the followers of another religion. When the interests of the followers of different religions or of different religious communities are seen to be mutually incompatible, antagonistic and hostile. Communalism is said to be at its apex. Thus, at this stage, the communalists assert that Hindus and Muslims cannot have common secular interest, and that their secular interests are bound to be opposed to each other.

To look upon the communal problem in India merely as the Hindu-Muslim question or religious antagonism between the Hindus and the Muslims is misleading. Apart from the Hindus and the Muslims there was third period in the communal triangle - the British rulers, who insinuate themselves between the Hindus and the Muslims and thus, created a communal triangle of which they remained the base.

### **Spread of Communalism:**

- The communalism spread as a result of British policy of *divide and rule*.
- The separation of electorates through the Constitutional Acts.
- The Act of 1909, gave weightage to the Muslims in the Legislative coucils elections.
- The spread of communalism among the Muslims, Hindu and Sikhs made the question of the Indian nationalism knotty.
- Yet, a considerable number of members of each community was patriotic and was on the side of the congress.
- The Nationalist leaders used religious overtones which led to causing the problem of communalism.

# **World War I and Indian Nationalism**

The First World War broke out in June 1914 between Britain, France and Russia on one side and Austria, Germany, Italy and Turkey on the other. As India was a colony of Britain, many Indians troops fought in different parts of the world as part of British army.

- When the war started, the congress was firmly under the control of *Gokhale* and the *Moderates*.
- The Indian National Congress decided to support the British war efforts, both as a matter of duty and in a spirit that grateful Britain would repay Indian's loyalty and gratitude.
- In India, the years of the war marked the maturing of nationalism.
- During the war India's manpower and resources were badly exploited.
- The moderate leaders remained loyal and supportive to the British war efforts.
- Some leaders like B. G. Tilak and Annie Besant were convinced that the British would not grant them their demand of self role till they pressurised them.
- The immediate impact of this nationalist wave in India was the launching of the Home Rule Movement by Mrs. Annie Besant and B. G. Tilak.
- War years turned out to be years of intense nationalist political agitation.
- Tilak's contention was that every Indian had the birth right to be free. He laid the foundations for the great anti-government movement led by Gandhiji in the next few years.
- To curb the revolutionary and terrorist activities, the government introduced repressive laws, which included the Indian Criminal Act, under which special Tribunals were set up to try the revolutionary and terrorist cases.

- Under the Defence of India Act, hundreds of suspects were transported without benefit of proper trial.
- These repressive measures hit the revolutionaries very hard, but did not blunt their courage.
- General Muslims uprising also took place on account of the declaration of war against Turkey.
- They strongly proposed that Muslims should not remain subservient to the British Government, but should participate in the National Movement.
- The events of the First World War and the prevalent sentiments were responsible for the Lucknow Pact and the *Khilafat Movement*.

### **Gadar Movement**

The movement also known as the "Gadar Mutiny" or the "Gadar Conspiracy" was a plan to initiate a pan-India revolt in the British Indian Army in 1915 to end British rule in India. The movement was linked to "Gadar Party"–An organisation founded by Punjabi Indians in the United States and Canada. Some of key members of Gadar Party were Lala Har Dayal, Sohan Singh Bhakna, Abdul Hafiz, Mohamed Barakatullah, Kartar Singh. Sarbha and Rasbehri Bose. The party had its headquarters in 'San Francisco'. It also published a magazine 'Gadar' for free distribution to promote aims and objectives of the organisation.

# **The Home Rule Movement**

The release of Tilak after 6 years of jail in Mandalay (Burma) moderated the launching of Home Rule Movement by Tilak and Mrs. Annie Besant, both of them decided to work in close co-operation to launch the movement to attain concessions, disillusionment with Morley - Minto Reforms and Wartime miseries. But the Home Rule Movement declined after Besant accepted the proposed *Montagu Chelmford Reforms* and Tilak went to Britain to pursue the case that he had filed against *Valentine Chirol*, the author of *Indian unrest*.

### **The Lucknow Session of Congress (1916)**

- Lucknow Pact was signed in 1916.
- By this pact, the Congress accepted the separate electorates given to the Muslims by the 1909 Act.
- By this it does not mean that the Congress and the Muslim League merged with each other. They still held up their annual sessions separately and had district agendas and political cause of action.

# **Beginning of the Gandhian Era [Post war situation]**

During the First World War, nationalism had required its forces and the nationalists were expecting major political achievements after the war; and they were willing to fight back of their expectations were thwarted. The economic situation in the post-war years had taken a turn for the worse. Indian industries, which had prospered during the war because of foreign imports of manufactured goods, faced losses and closure. The Indian industrialists wanted protection of their industries through imposition of high customs duties and grant of government aid, they realized that a strong nationalist movement and an independent Indian government along could secure these. The workers facing unemployment and high prices and living in great poverty, also turned actively towards the nationalist movement. The urban educated Indian faced increasing unemployment. Thus, all sections of Indian society were suffering economic hardships.

The government was aware of the rising tide of nationalist and anti-government sentiments once again decided to follow the policy of concessions and repressions.

### **Importance of the year 1919**

- The year 1919 constitutes an important landmark in the history of British India.
- The *Rowlatt Bills* and the reign of terror in Punjab culminated in *Jallianwala Bagh massacre*.
- The emergence of M. K. Gandhi.
- Development of Pan Islamism as a force of Indian politics.
- The passing of Government of India Act, 1919 on the basis of *Montagu Chelmsford Report*.

# **Government of India Act, 1919**

The Government of India Act of 1919 incorporated the idea of a dual form of government referred as diarchy for the major provinces. It was intended to bring partial responsible government.

- The provincial budget was separated from the central budget.
- The governor was empowered to reserve a bill for the consideration of the Governor General if it related to some specified matters.
- A post of High Commissioner was created.
- The central legislature was made bicameral for the first time. The Upper House was named the council of state. That contained 60 members in which 33 were elected. The Lower House was named the legislative Assembly. That contained 145 members in which 104 were elected.
- Direct election system was adopted in the province. In which reservation system was present on the basis of communalism.

**Entry of Gandhiji :** The arrival of Mahatma Gandhi on the political horizon of India added new management to the National Movement. He played a great part in the country's struggle for freedom. He returned to India from South-Africa in 1915. He led the struggle of Indian peasants and workers. During the First World War he advised the Indians to help the British government in the hope of getting Home Rule after the war. But the enactment of *Rowlatt Act, 1919*, created great unrest in the country. A powerful agitation rose against this Act. This Act was like giving stones to a hungry man. At this critical juncture Mahatma Gandhi entered the field of Indian politics and took the command of the national movement. So the period is generally called the Gandhian Era.

### **Some important points**

- Satyagraha is a combination of two sanskrit words: Satya (truth) and agraha (eagerness): In English Satyagraha is referred to a 'passive resistance'.
- Gandhiji's satyagraha was based on *truth* and *nonviolence*. For him, Satyagraha was a way of life, a spiritual and moral force.
- Gandhiji urged on non-violent methods of struggle and had faith in the power of masses. Under his leadership the Indian National Movement got a new direction and adopted new methods and techniques.
- Gandhiji moved by the degradation and humililation exprienced by the 'untouchables, led a crusade against this institution. He called these people 'Harijans' or 'Children of God'.
- He dedicated his life to the removal of untouchability. Spread of education among girls and Hindu-Muslim unity. He also promoted Swadeshi and popularized the *Chakra and Khadi*.

# **Rowlatt Acts, 1919**

In 1919, the British had passed the *Rowlatt Acts* by which the British government got power to detain anybody without trial for two years. Anybody could be imprisoned without a chance to defend himself or herself. Gandhiji called for satyagrah against the Rowlatt Act. The agitation against the act reached extreme in Punjab. A public meeting was held at *Jallinwala Bagh* in a small park enclosed by building on all sides. *General Dyer* with his troops entered the park and ordered his army to fire without any warning. This was the worst incidence of British rule.

# **Jallianwala Bagh Tragedy and its Aftermath**

- The Rowlatt Satyagraha as a political campaign was a failure as it did not attain its object 'the repeal of the Rowlatt Act.' But it projected Gandhiji as an all India leader of immense potential.
- The anti-Rowlatt Act agitation was particularly severe in the Punjab which was suffering from the after effects of wartime repression, forcible recruitment and the influence of the revolutionaries.
- The movement provoked a hartal in many parts of the Punjab, and violent disturbances took place.
- The Lieutenant Governor, Michael O 'Dwyer, had already earned notoriety as an oppressive administrator.
- On April 9, 1919, he ordered the arrest of two local Congress leaders, Dr. Satyapal and Dr. Kitchlew, who were associated with the Reception Committee for the annual session of the INC to be held in December 1919.
- To protest against their arrest and the British repression, a public meeting was held at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on April 13, 1919, where General Dyer arrived with armoured cars and troops and fired on the unarmed peaceful crowd without warning, killing nearly, 1,000 people and scores of others.
- The massacre of Jallianwala Bagh was followed by martial law and a veritable reign of terror prevailed in the Punjab.

• To protest against the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy Rabindranath Tagore surrendered the Knighthood conferred on him by the British Government.

### **Khilafat and Non-Co-operation Movements**

During 1919-22, the British were opposed through two mass movements– The Khilafat and Non Co-operation.

The British prime minister promised the Muslims that sultan of Turkey would not be humiliated after the end of Ist World War. The Khilafat movement aimed against the British government received the support of Mahatma Gandhi. He addressed the issue of Swaraj. All leaders boycotted British goods and clothes. On 4th February 1922, in Chauri Chaura, a violent clash broke up between local police and protestors. Gandhi went on for 3 days fast to appeal to the Indians to stop all resistance and the movement was called off.

**An Appraisal of the Movement:** The sudden suspension of the Non-Co-operation movement also led to the demise of the Khilafat issue and breakdown of the precariously balanced Hindu-Muslim harmony. Shortly after the movement was called off communalism became rampant all over the country and serious riots broke out. In Kerala, an anti-Zamindar bloodletting was witnessed, when Muslim Moplah peasants turned on Hindu landlords and moneylenders. The Communal situation became far worse during the years 1921-27 than it had been even before.

Mahatma Gandhi's promise to achieve Swaraj within a year of launching the movement was not fulfilled. The Non-Cooperation Movement failed to achieve any of its declared objectives. But its ultimate gain outweighed the immediate losses. The congress had become a force to reckon with and thereafter it went from strength to strength. It generated a desire for freedom and inspired the people to challenge the colonial rule.

### **The Swaraj Party (1923)**

The suspension of Non cooperation was not liked by the extremists. In the Gaya session of Congress *C.R. Das* had resigned from the membership of the Congress. He started *Swaraj Party at Allahabad*.

### **Simon Commission**

In November, 1927 the British government appointed the Simon Commission. It consisted all Britishers without a single Indian representative. The commission arrived in India in February 1928 and met with a strike.

# **Nehru Report (1928)**

The report was a memorandum outlining a proposed new dominion status constitution for India. It was prepared by a committee of All party conference chaired by Motilal Nehru and Jawaharlal Nehru as secretary.

#### **Provisions of Nehru Report**

- 1. Dominion status be granted for internal freedom be sanctioned.
- 2. Dyarchy should be removed and responsible rule be established.

- 3. A supreme court should be set up.
- 4. Federal government should be established.
- 5. The central legislature should consist of two houses.

# **Civil Disobedience Movement**

Civil Disobedince Movement was launched under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi in the year 1930 was one of the most important events of freedom struggle of the country. On 12th March, 1930, a Dandi salt march was started where the British salt law was broken. This angered the British government. On March 1930, Gandhi signed the Gandhi - Irwin pact. It aimed at the calling off the civil disobedience movement and participation of Congress in the Round Table Conference.

Civil disobedience movement was started again and continued till 1934.

Among the programmes outlined for the Civil Disobedience movement were:

- (i) The violation of the salt law and other laws;
- (ii) Boycott of courts, legislatures, elections, Government functions, Government school and colleges.
- (iii) Non-payment of land-revenue, rent or other taxes.
- (iv) Boycott of foreign goods and burning of foreign cloth;
- (v) Peaceful picketing of shops selling liquor and other intoxicants;
- (vi) Organising mass strikes and demonstrations;
- (vii) Resigning government jobs and not joining the civil, military or public services.

**Dandi March :** The Civil Disobedience movement was started by Gandhiji on 12th March 1930, with his famous Dandi March. Gandhiji along with 78 companions, which included Sarojini Naidu marched nearly 375 km from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi, a village in Gujarat sea-coast. It was on the same day after reaching Dandi, Gandhiji broke the law by making salt from sea water. A wave of enthusiasm swept the country. Salt laws were broken at many places and even women took part in the Civil Disobedience Movement.

#### **The Third Round Table Conference - (1932)**

(November 17 to December 24, 1932)

It was held in *London* in 1932. The Congress boycotted it.

Unhampered by the developments on the Indian political scene, the British Government continued with its work of constitutional reforms. The third Round table Conference was called on November 17, 1932 and it lasted till December 24 that year. The Congress boycotted it and only 46 delegates attended the session. This session put together the final features of a concrete plan for the Government of India Act 1935, which, after some amendments, was passed by the British Parliament on August 2, 1935.

### **Poona Pact**

The 'Poona Pact' was an agreement between Gandhiji and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar which was signed on 25th September 1932 in Poona. This agreement ended fast unto death undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi to protest '*Mc.Donand's Communal Award*' to the depressed classes (untouchables) by giving separate electorates to Dalits for electing members to the state legislative assemblies in British India. The major points of this pact were as follows:

- (1) 148 seats were allowed to the depressed classes in the provincial legislatives.
- (2) The representation of the depressed class in the central legislature would likewise will be on the principles of joint electorate.
- (3) Certain percentage of seats allotted to the general non-Muslim electorate was to be reserved for the depressed class.
- (4) Adequate representation was to be given to the depressed class in civil services.

### **Peasants' and Workers' Movement**

The 1930's economic depression worsened the condition of the peasants and workers in India. The prices of agriculture products dropped by over 50 percent by the end of 1932. The employers tried to reduce wages. The peasants all over the country began to demand land reforms, abolition of zamindari, reduction of land revenue and rent, and relief from indebtedness. Workers in the factories and plantations increasingly demanded better conditions of work and recognition of their trade union rights. The Civil Disobedience movement and the rise of the left parties and groups produced a new generation of political workers who devoted themselves to the organisation of peasants and workers. Consequently, there was rapid growth of trade unions in the cities and the Kisan Sabhas in many areas particularly in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Punjab. The first All-India peasant organisation, the *All-India Kisan Sabha* was formed in 1936 under the Presidentship of *Swami Sahajanand Saraswati*. The peasants also began to take a more active part in the national movement.

### **The Government of India Act 1935 :**

- The Government of India Act 1935 consisted of 14 parts, 321 Articles and 10 schedules. The Act of 1935 prescribed a federation, taking the provinces and the Indian states as its units. It was optional for the Indian states to join the federation, and since they never joined the federation never came into being.
- The Government of India Act 1935 referred to diarchy on central level. The central legislature was bicameral consisting of the federal Assembly and the council of the state.
- The Act divided legislative powers between centre and provinces. The executive authority of the centre was vested in the Governor General on behalf of the crown. the Governor General could prevent discussion in the legislature and suspend the proceeding on a Bill.
- A central court was established in Delhi consisting of a chief justice, other three judges and two additional judges. Central Reserve Bank was established by Act of 1935. Diarchy on province was abolished, Vidhan Parishad was established in some provinces.

### **Tebhaga Movement (1939)**

The Tebhaga Movement was a movement of peasants in Bengal. At that time the peasants or tenants had to give half of their harvest to the owner of the land or the Zamindars. The peasants insisted that one-third of the harvest should be taken by landlords in place of one-half. This movement marked as turning point in the history of agrarian movements in India.

### **The August Offer, 1940**

In 1940 session at Ramgarh (Bihar), Congress passed a resolution to offer support to British government in war if a provisional national government is set up at the centre. In response to this, the then Viceroy 'Lord Linlithgow' offered something which became popular as 'the August Offer'.

Some key elements of the proposal were :

- 1. A representative "constitution making body" shall be appointed immediately after the war.
- 2. The number of Indian in the Viceroy's executive council will be increased.
- 3. A war advisory council would be set up.

Congress, however did not approve "The August Offer".

### **Cripps Mission (1942)**

Churchill was compelled to change his attitude. He came to discuss with Indian leaders and break the constitutional stalemate.

In March 1942, the British Government sent Sir Stafford Cripps, a member of the war cabinet, to India with a Draft Declaration. The Drafted Declaration had the following features:

- (i) It reiterated the intention of the British Government to set up an Indian Union soon after the war.
- (ii) The Indian Union would have dominion status with power to secede from the commonwealth.
- (iii) An elected body charged with the task of framing a new constitution for India with the Princes as participants.
- (iv) Pakistan was conceded in principle, in that once the constitution was drawn up, any province might opt out of the Indian Union.
- (v) The Constitution-making body would conclude a treaty with the British Government guaranteeing to protect the racial and religious minorities and covering all other necessary matters.
- (vi) Until a new constitution was framed, the British Government was to remain responsible for the defence of India.

Negotiations between Cripps and the Congress leaders broke down. Stafford Cripps returned home in the middle of April leaving behind frustrated and embittered Indian people.

The failure of the Cripps Mission and the growing threat of Japanese aggression brought about a radical change in Mahatma Gandhi's attitude towards the British Government. The people's discontent with rising prices and wartime shortages was reaching an explosive stage. Japan won a series of dramatic victories in the Western Pacific. Malaya and Singapore were overrun, and the retreating British troops surrendered Rangoon in early March 1942. Soon the Japanese were at India's eastern frontier, and brought India within the range of actual hostilities. Mahatma Gandhi came to believe that "the presence of the British in India is an invitation to Japan to invade India and their withdrawal removes the bait." He therefore asked the British "*to leave India in God's hands or in modern parlance to anarchy*".

# **Quit India Resolution**

'Wardha Resolution' is also known as '*Quit-India Resolution*'*.* In Wardha Session of Congress in 1942, a resolution was passed that demanded that the British rule in India must end immediately. This resolution was an outcome of the change of attitude of Congress party towards British rule.

# **Quit India Movement**

- In 1942, Gandhiji started the final movement called the *Quit India movement* with the famous slogan of *Do or Die*.

- A large number of people extended their co-operation to Gandhiji and the Indians came out in open rebellion against the Britishers.
- They set fire to police stations, post offices, railway stations and other government buildings.
- The Quit India movement made a great contribution to the Freedom struggle of India. It made the Indian masses determined to get freedom.
- The Quit India Movement inaugurated at the call of Mahatma unfolded in four phases. In the first phase there were strikes, processions, and demonstrations. This phase lasted for three to four days and commenced from the day of Gandhi's arrest on August 9th, 1942.
- Quit India movement was Gandhi's final bid to secure India's independence.

# **C. R. Formula (Rajaji Formula):**

It soon became evident to the government that no solution to the Indian problem was possible without the concurrence of the Muslim League. Gandhiji tried to reach an accord with Jinnah. They met in Bombay from September 9 to 27, 1944. Rajagopalachari had induced Gandhiji to accept the principle of Pakistan and had devised a formula which formed the basis of the talks in 1944, to end the deadlock between the Congress and the Muslim League.

The C. R. Formula became the basis for the Gandhi - Jinnah talks in Bombay in 1944 itself to settle the Hindu-Muslim differences.

# **Wavell Plan (1945)**

Mr. Wavell presented a plan for ending the political problems in India. It is known as Wavell plan. It was assured that all the members of Executive except viceroy and the commander - in - chief would be Indian. The representation of Hindus and Muslims would be equal in the viceroy's council. Indians would have the right to frame out their constitution. But this plan became a failure.

# **Simla Conference**

The Simla conference was a 1945 meeting between viceroy *Archibald Wavell* and the major political leaders of India at Simla. It began in cordial atmosphere but due to obstinacy of *Jinnah* and his communal viewpoint no decision could be taken.

# **Cabinet Mission (1946)**

When the cabinet mission arrived in Delhi, it had three members, Cripps, A.V. Alexander and Pethick Lawrence. The mission talked with Congress and Muslim League about the interim government and constitutional assembly. Muslim League demanded for separate nation whereas the Congress opposed it.

Sir Pethick Lawrence, while announcing the appointment of the Mission had made it clear that its objectives was to set up quickly a machinery for drawing up the constitution for independent India and to make necessary arrangements for an Interim government.

The Cabinet Mission spent the first three weeks in discussions with the leaders of various political parties, members of the Viceroy's Executive Council, the rulers of Princely States, etc. After all these discussions, when it could not arrive at any agreed solution, the Cabinet Mission announced its own recommendations on May 16, 1946.

# **Declaration of Atlee**

In July 1946, Congress found a glorious victory in the election of constituent assembly. The Muslim League felt defeated. Dangerous communal riots broke out at Silhat, Tripura, No akhali, Garhmukteshwar, Bihar and other places.

After Direct Action day, the Atlee, P.M. of the British Government announced to leave India.

# **Mountbatten Plan**

Lord Mountbatten, who had came to India as Viceroy in March 1947, worked out a compromise after long discussions with the Congress and Muslim League - The country was free but not united. India was to be partioned and a new state of Pakistan was to be created along with a free India. He announced his compromise Plan on 3rd June 1947.

### **Salient features of the plan**

- 1. If the areas with the majority of the Muslim population so desired, they should be allowed to form a separate dominion. A new constituent assembly would be set up.
- 2. Boundary commission would be set up to define the boundaries of the Hindu and Muslim provinces in Bengal and the Punjab.
- 3. The governor general should be common to both dominions and that the present governor general should be reappointed.

- 5. In the case of two dominions, the armed forces should be divided between them.

In July 1947, the British Parliament passed the historic Indian *Independence Act* to legalize the *Mountbatten Plan*. The Act, thus provided for the establishment of two independent states - India and Pakistan with effect from 15 August 1947. The boundary lines between the two nations were drawn by *Rad Cliff*, a British lawyer, who knew nothing about Indian conditions or geography.

The country was to be partitioned but not on the basis of Hinduism and Islam. India became independent on 15 August, 1947.

On the night of 14 August Jawaharlal Nehru, said in his midnight speech,' *At the stroke of midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom*....".

# **Fourteen Points of Jinnah**

The Fourteen Points of Jinnah were proposed by *Muhammad Ali Jinnah* as a Constitutional Reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in a self-governing India. A comparison of the Nehru Report (1928) with Jinnah's Fourteen Points had a political gap between the Muslims and the Hindus in India. Jinnah aim was to get more right for Muslims. He therefore gave his 14 points. These points covered all the interests of the Muslims at heated time and in this Jinnah stated that it was the "parting of way" and that he did not want and would not have anything to do with the Indian National Congress in the Future. The League leaders motivated Jinnah to revive the Muslim League and gave it direction. As a result, these points became the demands of the Muslims and greatly influenced the Muslim thinking for the next two decades till the establishement of Pakistan in 1947.

- The Maharaja of Kashmir also delayed accession to India or Pakistan even though the popular forces led by Sheikh Abdullah's National Conference wanted accession to India.
- When Pathans and irregular armed forces of Pakistan invaded Kashmir, the Maharaja of Kashmir sought the assistance of the Government of India.
- On 26 October 1947, he formally acceded to the Indian Union, whose air borne troops saved the situation in the nick of time.
- On 31 October 1947 an interim government was formed with Sheikh Abdullah as its head, which, with the help of Indian troops, successfuly repelled tribal raids, aided and abetted by Pakistan.
