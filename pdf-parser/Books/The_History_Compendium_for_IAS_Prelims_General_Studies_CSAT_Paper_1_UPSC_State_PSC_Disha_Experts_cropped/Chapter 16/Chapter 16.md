# Introduction

Europeans had a great demand for Indian products such as Indian spices like *pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger* and such other things which provoked them to start trading in India. At that time the commercial activities of Asia was being controlled by the *Arabs*. In 1400 AD trade was proved to be immensely profitable and *Italy* was treated as a distribution centre for the spices obtained from India. The sea voyage of Europeans had started in India much before the establishment of Moghul Empire as they were well aware of India's prosperity.

# **THE PORTUGUESE**

In 1498, a Portuguese navigator, *Vasco da Gama*, came to Calicut on the western coast of India for the first time with a motive of trading. With this, he became *the first European* to re-establish trade relations with India. Primarily his finding was confined only to find new trade route from *Europe to Asia via Cape of Good Hope*. He was well-received by the Zamorin of Calicut. He returned back to Portugal in 1499 AD. His second visit to India was in 1502 followed by the arrival of *Pedro Alvarez* Cabral in 1500 which led to the establishment of Portuguese Trading Centers at *Calicut, Cannanore and Cochin.*

#### **Objective of Portuguese Advent:**

- The maritime empire of Portuguese was named as *Estado da India*, which were primarily confined to the control of Indian export to Europe but in later age they monopolised the port-to-port *trade on the Malabar Coast* and trade from *Indian to Persian Coast*.
- Initially their trade was restricted only to export spices from India but later on they had shifted their focus to other valuable items such as *wheat, rice, silk and precious stone*.
- The growth of European trade was hampered by sending fleet annually so the term was extended on three year basis by the Portuguese Governors.

#### **Portuguese Governors:**

#### *Francisco De Almeida(1505-1509)*

- 1. He was the *First governor and viceroy* of Portuguese India, appointed by King Manuel I of Portugal
- 2. He erected forts in *Anjediva, Cochin, Cannanore*, and refused to cede office until after Battle of Diu.
- 3. He initiated the *Blue Water Policy*, which aimed at the Portuguese Mastery of the Sea and confined portuguese relationship with India only for the purpose of trade & commerce.

#### *Alfonzo-De-Albuquerque (1509-1550):*

- 1. He was the second Portuguese Governor and Viceroy of India who controlled Persian gulf and Red sea; established head quarters on western coast of India and destroyed the Arab Trade in Malay Peninsula.
- 2. He conquered Goa in 1510 from the Sultan of Bijapur.
- 3. He encouraged the propagation of Christianity & intermarriage with the natives
- 4. He died at *Table Bay*, on return voyage, in march 1510.

#### **The Impact of Portuguese:**

1. The Portuguese began to spread Christianity in the *Malabar & the Konkan coast*. Missionaries like *St. Francis Xavier*, *Father Rudolf & Father Monserette* played a leading role in propagating the Christian faith.

- 2. The Missionaries started schools & colleges along the west coast, where education was imparted in the native language.
- 3. The missionaries undertook research on Indian history and culture. The Portuguese brought *the printing press*  to India. The Bible came to be printed in the Kannada & Malayalam language.
- 4. The Portuguese brought some crops to India like *Tobacco*, some fruits & vegetables were also introduced by him *potatoes, lady's finger, chilly, pineapple, sapota, groundnuts,* etc.

#### **Causes for Decline of Portuguese:**

- 1. After Albuquerque the Portuguese administration in India became inefficient because his successor were *weak & inefficient.*
- 2. The Portuguese officials were neglected by the home government. Their salaries were low. Thus they indulged in *corruption and malpractice*.
- 3. The Portuguese adopted *forced inter-marriage* & *conversion to the Christian faith* which made the natives hostile.
- 4. In 1580 *Portugal was merged with Spain* which neglected the Portuguese interest in India.
- 5. The Portuguese has to face the *stiff competition of the Dutch* in India.
- *6. Portuguese discovered Brazil* which diverted their attention from India.

#### **Portuguese Colony in India:**

Establishment of trading stations gave rise to small colonies of Portuguese had also been developed in the coastal part of India, such as *Calicut, Coachin, Cannanore, Daman, Salsette, Chaul, Bombay,San Thome near Madras* and *Hoogli* in Bengal. **Cochin** was the first capital of Portuguese in India which later shifted to *Goa* by *Nino da Cunha.*

# **THE DUTCH**

The Portuguese enjoyed trade monopoly over the Arabian Sea till the 17th century. The complete monopoly of the Dutch over trade and commerce of Indonesia was another reason as to why they left India. The decline of Portuguese had started with the advent of Dutch in 1605. The Dutch East India Company of Netherlands was formed in 1592 to trade with East Indies. *Cornelis Houtman* was the first Dutch to come to India. The Dutch established trading centres at *Nagapatnam* in Tamil Nadu, *Machlipatnam* in Andhra Pradesh, *Chinsora* in Bengal & at *Mahe* on the Malabar Coast. The headquarters of the Dutch in India was **Nagapatnam**. The Dutch could not withstand the stiff competition of the Portuguese and the English and thus left India.

### **Techniques of Trade:**

- 1. Dutch occupied the Indian subcontinent from 1605 to 1825 with an aim of trade of various items.
- 2. Merchants of the *Dutch East India Company* first established themselves in *Dutch Coromandel*, notably **Pulicat**, as they were looking for textiles to exchange with the spices they traded in the East Indies.
- 3. Apart from textiles, the items traded in Dutch India include *precious stones*, *indigo*, and silk across the Indian Peninsula, *saltpeter* and *opium* in Dutch Bengal, and *pepper* in Dutch Malabar.
- 4. The excellent business techniques of Dutch can be illustrated from the fact that they started trading without the interference of middle man to earn maximum profit.
- 5. They became commercially active in India and they introduced coins to be used in trading with local importance.

### **Dutch Settlements in India:**

Like Portuguese the Dutch union too established their settlements along the coasts of India which were of commercial interests. Important among them were:

#### **(i) Malabar Coast :**

Though primarily the Dutch opted for Malabar coast of India, later they found it to be less profitable as the spice trade of Malabar was less valuable then cloth trade of Coromandel Coast. **Vengurla** was the only coast occupied by Dutch. After a bitter struggle of Power the Dutch were defeated by the English in the *Battle of Bedara*, 1759.

#### **(ii) Coromandel Coast:**

*Admiral Van Hagen* started trade with then *Coromandel Coast*  by setting up permanent settlement in *Masulipatnam* in early 1605. Soon another factory was founded at *Devanampatnam*  (Tegnapatnam) or *Fort St. David*. In 1610 AD Dutch established another factory on the *Pulicat coast* and named it as *Fort Geldria* in honour of the home province of Van Berchem, the Director General of the *Coromandel Factories*.

#### **(iii) Trade in Bengal**

The Dutch East India Company started trading with Bengal from 1615. In 1627, a trading post was established in *Pipli*. In addition they set up colonies at *Chinsurah* adjacent to Hooghly during 1627 which facilitated trade in *opium, salt, muslin and spices*. A fort called *Fort Gustavius*, a church and several other buildings were built. A famous Frenchman, *General Perron*  who served as military advisor to the Mahrattas, was also settled in this Dutch colony near Bengal Coast. They have also settled factories in Pipli which later on shifted to *Balasore* , but remained in neglected state as the focus was maximum on Chinsura.

# **THE ENGLISH**

*Captain Williams Hawkins* was the first English who came to India with a purpose of trade during the tenure of *Mughal Emperor Jehangir* & received permission to do the same at *Surat*. Initially both Indians and Europeans were benefitted by the trade. During these early days, the British fought with other Europeans to gain monopoly over trade. In the early part of the 17th century the British were able to *overcome the Portuguese* in these conflicts. They became victorious even against the Dutch towards the end of the 18th century.

- After Captain Williams Hawkins, *Captain Best* came to India and got permitted to start a factory at Surat.
- He defeated the Portuguese in the *Battle of Swalley* near Surat.
- In 1615, *Sir Thomas Roe* visited the court of *Jehangir* and obtained *trade concessions*.
- With due course of time several trading centers were emerged at different places in India such as *Madras*, *Machalipatnam, Hariharpur, Balasore , Kasim bazaar and Hoogly*.
- The company obtained *Bombay* from the English *King Charles II* who received it as a part of dowry, when he married the Potuguese Princess Catherine.
- The English acquired three villages in Bengal which later developed to become *Calcutta*. The later Moghul Emperor Farookhsiyar granted the English the firman which permitted them to carry on duty free trade in Bengal. The Headquarters of the English Company in India was *Madras*.
- During this phase the internal conflicts of kings had gone up to great extents which incited the English to take part in the internal wars of the kings. They started helping the kings with their military tricks and troops and sometimes their alliance had a great victory over the enemies which made English rapacious and they started taking undue advantages from winning party.
- Thus the English permanently settled in India till 1947. In 1707 the different trading companies came together to form the "*United Company of the Merchants of England trading to East Indies*". It was this Company which carried on trade & commerce with India till 1857.

**Exports:** Textile woven with specific patterns were the main attraction of trade with British East India Company followed by indigo, saltpeter, and Opium.

**Imports:** The prime products imported at Coromandel Coasts were sandalwood and pepper from Archipelago, Copper from Japan and Textile from China.

# **THE FRENCH**

- French were the last European community which came to India during 1664 AD. The French East India Company was established by Jean Baptiste Colbert, the Minister of Louis XIV, the Bourban king of France. They were authorized to carry on commerce and establish colonies in the East Indies.
- The first French Factory had established in *Surat* in 1667 under the state patronage of Gujarat. In 1669 the second French factory was established at *Masulipatnam* by securing patent from the *Sultan of Golconda*.
- The well-known French Viceroy in India is *Franco Martin.* He extended the French commercial activities

in India by establishing French settlements at Balasore, Chinsurah Masulipatnaam, and *Pondicherry*. Among which Pondicherry was considered to be the most important settlement of French and hence designated as the Headquarters of French in India.

#### **French Governors**

*Joseph-Francois Dupleix*, the most powerful Governor of French possessions was appointed in 1742. He had entered into agreements with native rulers so as to fulfil his dream of establishing French Supremacy over India. During his governance French power reached its peak. He succeeded in establishing his supremacy over the Carnatic and the Deccan which became a threat to British. But towards the end of his term the French started losing their ground to British in 1753- 54. In early 1760 they completely lost their power and position to British in India. This Anglo- French rivalry can be best illustrated by the three Carnatic wars fought between French and English from 1745 to 1763.

#### **CARNATIC WARS**

- (a) **First Carnatic War (1746 A.D. 1748 A.D.):**
- **• Also known as :** *Battle of Thomas*.

# **18th CENTURY INDIA**

With the descent of mighty Mughal Empire, a large number of new states started growing all over India in 18th century. They continued to remain prominent till 20th century. These autonomous states were established with their own viable economic as well as law and order systems. In addition the administrations of individual states were having a good control over the surplus production of the peasants which helped them to establish the local centers of power and patronage.

The newly formed states were Hyderabad, Carnatic, Bengal, Awadh, Mysore, Rajputana and Punjab.

# **Hyderabad**

• The state of Hyderabad was first envisaged by the Viceroy of Deccan, *Zulfiqar Khan* who administered the state with the help of *Daud Khan* since 1708.

- He signed an agreement with Marathas against Ahmad Shah Abdali with a declaration that Marathas were to be paid ` 50 lakhs, granted the *Chauth of the Punjab*, Sindh and the Doab in addition to the *Subahdari of Ajmer and Agra*. However the agreement could not last long and failed as the the Peshwa went over to Safdar Jung's enemies at Delhi.
- After the death of Safdar Jung his son Shuja-ud Daula took over Awadh Empire and later became the Wazir of Delhi.
- He signed an agreement with the Nawab of Bengal, *Mir Qasim* as well as with the Emperor *Shah Alam II*, against the Company. He suffered a crushing defeat in the *Battle of Buxar* in October 1764.

#### **Mysore**

- The third *Anglo-Mysore* War was the result of the conflict between the newly formed alliance and Tipu Sultan where he lost nearly half of his territory.
- Finally in the fourth *Anglo-Mysore* war Tipu Sultan completely lost his territory.

### **Rajputanas**

- The Rajputanas took advantages of weak government of Mughal dynasty and freed themselves from the central control of Mughal Empire.
- The Rajput States were often divided among themselves and engaged in petty quarrels and civil wars.

# **SOCIO-ECONOMIC CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE**

The eighteenth century society witnessed two extreme situation of socio-economic condition which stopped its progress socially, culturally and economically. Extreme poverty existed joining hands in hand with extreme rich. The multi layered society was structured on the basis of religion, region, tribe, language, class and caste etc. The increasing revenue demands of the state, the oppression and rapacity of the Zamindars, revenue farmers and the depredation of the adventurers made the life of the people miserable. The lower strata of the society had to bear all sorts injustice and inequalities imposed to them by the upper class. Agriculture was the primary occupation of the people followed by trade.

# **Agriculture**

Though it was the primary occupation of the lower strata of the society of 18th century, it was not much developed. The peasant were used to the age old practices of cultivation which was unable to provide them with greater yield from their piece of land. Additionally the taxes and revenues imposed on them by the Zamindars made the condition even more pathetic. The peasants worked hard with the old technology to get more productivity but all were in vain as the Zamindars, Jagirdars and revenue farmers collected maximum amount of the production.

# **Trade**

Trading was the major look out of the people coming under higher strata of the society and extensive trade within and outside the countries were carried out during the Mughal Period.

Different products were being imported from various countries such as *pearls, raw silk, wools, dates, dried fruits, and rose water* from *Persian Gulf*; *coffee*, *gold*, *drugs* and *honey* from *Arabia*; *tea*, *sugar*, *porcelain*, *and silk* from *China*; *gold, musk, woolen clothes* from *Tibet*; *Tin from Singapore*, *spices, perfumes, arrack and sugar* from *Indonesia*; *ivory and drugs* from *Africa; woolen clothes and metal such as iron, copper, lead and paper* from *Europe*.

As India was rich and self sufficient in some of the product such as *cotton textile, wheat, rice, silk, opium, sugar, pepper, spices precious stones* etc, these are largely exported from India to other parts of the world. Consequently export of India was more than its import.
