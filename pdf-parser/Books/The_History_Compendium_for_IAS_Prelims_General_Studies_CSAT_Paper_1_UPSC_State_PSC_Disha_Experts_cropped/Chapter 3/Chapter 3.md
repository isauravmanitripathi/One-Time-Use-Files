## DISCOVERY

Scholar believed that the history of India began with the coming of the Aryans. When Sir John Marshal announced the discovery of a new civilization named Indus Valley civilization in a *London weekly* in 1924, a great sensation was created among the world archaeologists. Though, in 1826 an English man named Charles Masson had got large number of bricks from a place named Harappa. Later on in 1831, when Colonel Burnes was going to meet Maharaja Ranjeet Singh, he visited the Wreckage of Harappan. Similarly, in 1853 and 1856 Alexander Cunningham supervised the ruins of Harappa. In 1856 the English government started making railway track from Karachi to Lahaur. For this the work of excavation was started and many mysterious objects were obtained but on seeing those objects from ruins the workers became frightened and the work was postponed.

It was in 1921 Daya Ram Sahni got the site excavated at Harappa in the Montgomery district of the **Punjab** (now in Pakistan) on the left bank of **Ravi**. Just after one year in 1922, **Rakhal Das Banerjee** discovered the remains of civilization at **Mohenjodaro** in the *Larkana* district of **Sindh**, now in Pakistan. These two excavations prepared the foundation of a new chapter in history which is studied under the name of Indus Valley Civilization. Now Let us study more about it.

## GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENT

Discoveries have extended the area of the Indus Valley. The 1400 settlements, discovered so far are distributed over a very wide geographical area. It is known extent in the West upto Sutkagendor in Baluchistan; Alamgirpur (Meerut, U.P.) in the East, Daimabad (Ahmadnagar, Maharashtra) in South and Manda (Akhoot, J & K) in the North. Thus, From West to East the **Indus Civilization covered an area of 1600 km and from North to South of 1100 km**. All the settlements are mostly located on the river banks of **Indus and Saraswati**. In 1947, after the partition of India, all the well known Harappan sites, Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Chahundaro and Jhukar (near Larkana) went to Pakistan. The shape of the civilization was triangular covering an area of about 12,50,000 sq. km. Let's see the areas in Maps and chart.

## **NOMENCLATURE**

The two names, Harappan civilization or Indus civilization are used interchangeably. The first one is derived from an *academic* tradition used in *archaeology*. Thus, *Harappan civilization* based on a notion that it began at a site which best represents the *ancient urban system* of South Asia.

Whereas, the **Indus civilization** began from the river valley of the Indus river with the largest concentration of settlement sites along the course of this river. *John Marshall* was first scholar to use this term.

### **Difference between pre-harappan and proto-Harappan cultures :**

All the cultures existing before the Harappa culture are called pre-harappa culture whereas proto-Harappa cultures are those pre-harappa cultures which take some close similarities with the Harappa-culture. Here it would be pertinent to indicate that the Harappa civilization belongs to the Bronze Age (during the year 2500 to 1750 B.C.) extending from Baluchistan (Pakistan) to Gujarat in India.

**Comparison with others:** According to Sir John Marshall chat the standard of civilized life reached by the people of Harappa and Mohenjodaro was higher than that of the ancient Babylonians and **Egyptians** and equal to that of Sumerians.

## **BASIC FEATURES OF INDUS VALLEY CIVILIZATION**

#### **Town Planning**

- The most striking feature of Harappan civilisation is its town-planning and sanitation.
- Harappan cities such as Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Kalibangan, Dholavira & Surkotada, were divided into **two parts** - a **fortified settlement** on the high mounds called '**citadels**' and the main residential areas called '*lower town*'. 'Citadel' was smaller in area than the 'lower town' and located to the west of the cities.
- Houses were built of *Kiln-burnt bricks*. At Lothal and Kalibanga residential houses were made of sun-dried bricks.
- The drains, wells, bathing platforms were made of Kilnburnt bricks.

- Most of the houses had wells within them and a **drainage system** carried the waste water to the main underground drain of the street. The covered drains had **soak-pits** and **manholes** for clearing.
- The arrangements for street lighting were available for the people.
- The main streets ran from North to South varied from 9 ft to 34 ft in width.
- Municipal authority controlled the development of the city.
- The streets ran in straight lines crossing one another at right angles. Houses stood on both sides of the streets. The street and lanes were not paved but a famous street called **'The first street'** of Mohenjodaro was surfaced with broken bricks and potsherds.
- Harappa and Mohenjodaro were built entirely of burnt bricks. All the bricks were well proportioned measuring 26 × 12.5 × 5.5 cm. Large bricks (51 cm) were used to cover drains. The bricks were made of **Alluvial soil.** Wedge-shaped bricks were used in the lining of wells. Small bricks were used for making the bathroom pavements watertight. L-shaped bricks were preferred for corners.
- The buildings (dwelling house, larger buildings and public baths, granaries, etc.) were mostly plain without plasters. At Kalibanga, ornamental bricks were used in the floor of a house. The ground floor of a small house measured 8 × 9 metres and the large one was double of its size.
- Some of the houses were double storeyed. Wooden beams were used in making the roofs. The roofs were made of reed matting covered with thick coating mud. A few staircases have been discovered. Wooden staircase with high narrow steps (38 cm highs, 13 cm wide) were used in general. The roofs were flat and enclosed by a parapet.
- Gutters of pottery (found at Chahundaro) were made for draining the rainwater. The entrance to the house was made from the street side.
- The open court was the basic feature of house planning. The courtyard (paved with bricks) was laid flat and surrounded by chambers. Doors and windows opened into it. Doors were placed at the ends of the walls, not in the middle and outer walls from the roadside had no windows.
- Perforated lattices were used as windows or ventilators. Houses had *stairways* made of solid masonry. In some buildings, the stairways led to the upper storeys which contained the bath and the living and sleeping apartments.
- An average house had besides kitchen and bath, four to six living rooms. Some large houses had near about thirty rooms. The kitchen was small and fuel was placed on a high platform.

- Cooking was done in the courtyards in the open. Sometimes an aperture in the wall was made between the kitchen and the larger room for making a '**serving hatch**'. The waste water ran into the earth through a pottery vessel with a hole sunked in the kitchen.
- Every house had its bathroom on the side of the street.
- Latrine found between the bathroom and the street. The bathroom had brick pavement sloping towards one corner. Pottery rasps were used to remove thickened cuticle.
- From Mohenjodaro large **khans (inns)**, stone houses and watch towers have been unearthed. This is an extensive building on the West of the stupa measuring 69 × 23.5 metres. It was a priestly corporation containing the **Great Bath**. The whole complex is a single unit which is named the '*Collegiate Building*'. At that time bathing was a ritual and the Great Bath (12 × 7 metres) made of burnt brick, was used only on ceremonial occasions. It has *staircases* on both sides. Below the staircases is a broad platform (01 m wide, 41 cm high). It was a safe bathing place for children. There are eight bathrooms on the North of the Great Bath. This building was for priests.
- There was a large oval well which supplied water. A hall (8 metres square) has been discovered on the South of the stupa. It was used for some religious assembly. John Marshall compares it with a Buddhist rock-cut-temple while Mackay calls it a large market hall with lines of permanent stalls along the aisles. There are four wellpaved aisles which are separated by rows of pillars. At Harappa a building has been discovered measuring 50 × 40 metres with a central passage of 07 metres wide. It was a store house for grain.
- Near the 'First street' there was a palatial building with two spacious *courtyards*, *servant quarters* and *store rooms*. It was either a temple or the residence of the Governor.
- The entire city was protected by a '*city wall*'. A small fort has been laid bare in most of the important cities.
- Like Babylonia and Egypt, Harappans did not use any foundation deposits. For this nothing is known about the ceremonies associated with the lying of foundation that can help the excavator to know about the history of the building.
- The Harappan **fortifications** were not meant to defend the township from strong attacks by enemies. It was constructed for the protection against **floods**, **robbers** and **cattle raiders**. It was also a hallmark of social authority over the area they commanded.
- The Harappan towns were encompassed by walls with gateways, the simple entry points to the town. Some of the gateways had attached guard rooms.

## **Religious life**

- Harappan people had features of *Hinduism*, such as worship of the mother Goddess, Pashupati, Shiva, Scared animals, trees, etc.
- *Clay figures* of the mother goddess as the symbol of fertility have been found.
- The three-faced deity wearing a horned head-dress, seated cross-legged on a throne, and surrounded by elephant, tiger, buffalo and rhinoceros, with deer appearing under the seat is the representation of Lord Shiva.
- Marshall has discovered some conical and cylindrical stones which indicate the *phallic worship,* i.e. *lingam worship*. Similarly, on the basis of small ring stones, Marshall suggested them the female generative organ (yoni) which indicate the worshipping of the Mother Goddess.
- At Kalibangan, fire altars have been discovered.
- We do not find any tracer of temple or places for worship at any of the Harappan sites.

#### **Worship**

- Harappans believed in animal worship. The animals fall into three groups :
  - **(1) Mythical animals** or complex animals, e.g. a semi human, semi-bovine creature
  - **(2) Ambiguous creature,** e.g. the strand unicorn accompanied with manager or incense-burner and
  - **(3) Actual animal** including the rhinoceros, the bison, the tiger, the humped bull, etc.
- The most common animal found on the Harappan seals is the **bull** which has been referred to as '**a unicorn**'.
- The cow is not dipicted or introduced anywhere.
- Tree worshipping was a culture in this civilization. **Pipal tree** was the most worshipped tree.
- Indus people believed in armlets and Talisman. On a seal, a six-rayed motif is depicted signifying the sun. Clay models of oxen were used as motive offerings. Tablets of clay and copper were used as armlets.

- Swastik and cross signs were **harbingers** of good luck.
- Daya Ram Shahni has discovered the famous dancing girl called '**Devadasi**' which is depicted on a seal.
- The offering of animals in **sacrifice** was a Harappan practice which have been discovered from Mohenjodaro and Kailbangan. In a 'fire-altar' bovine, bones and outliers were discovered which represent some kind of animal sacrifice.

#### **Funerary Customs**

Three forms of burials have been found at Mohenjodaro, viz, **complete burials**, **Fractional burials** (only, a collection of bones are buried after the exposure of the body of wild beasts and birds) and **part - cremation burials.**

**At** *Kalibangan* three types of burial practices are noticed:

- 1. Extended inhumanion in rectangular or oval graves,
- 2. Pot-burial in the circular pit containing pots and grave goods like beads and
- 3. Pottery deposit in rectangular or oval graves.

At *Lothal*, two types of burial practices were followed the first type contained the grave goods and a single skeleton, the other contained two skeletons buried together.

## **Economic Life**

Harappan people were comfort living and prosperous. Their richness was due to surplus agriculture, cattle rearing, proficiency in various crafts and trade.

#### **Agriculture**

- Agriculture was the **backbone** of the Harappan people. Sindh was a fertile part of country.
- The Indus people sowed seeds in the flood plains in November when the flood water receded, and reaped their harvests of wheat and barley in April, before the advent of the next flood.
- They produced wheat, barley, peas, kodon, sanwa, jowar, ragi, etc.
- Two types of wheat the club wheat campactum and the Indian **dwarf wheat** (**Ttriticum sphaerococcum**) were grown.
- Barley (hordeum vulgare, probably of a small-seeded six-rowed variety, was also sound at Kalibangan. *Barley*  and wheat have been the most important crops at all Harappan sites.
- Other crops include **dates**, **seasam** and **mustard** were also grown.
- It seems that as early as 180 B.C. the people of Lothal used **rice** whose remains have been found.
- *The evidence of the sugarcane has not been found yet.*  Though its presence is to be expected. At Lothal and

Rangpur, rice husks and spikelets were found embedded in clay and pottery.

- A fragment of woven cotton cloth has been found at Mohenjodaro. *The Indus people were the earliest people to produce cotton.*
- The Harappans used the wooden plough with wooden or copper plough share.
- Stone and Copper sickles may have been used for harvesting the crops.
- Gabar bands or nalas enclosed by dams were used for storing the water which are found at Baluchistan and Afghanistan. *No evidences of channel or canal irrigation has been discovered from the sites of this civilization.*

#### **Animal Husbandry**

- Animals were kept on a large scale and *oxen, buffaloes*  (Bubalus bubalis), *goats* (Sus cristatus), *sheep*, and *pigs*  were domesticated.
- *Dogs* and *cats* were also domesticated. The *humped bulls*  were favoured by the Harappans.
- *Asses* and *Camels* were used as *beasts of burden*. Camel bones are reported at Kalibangan.
- The only plausible evidence of the horse comes from Surkotada belonging to around 2000 B.C.
- *Elephants* were well known to the Harappans. They were also acquainted with the rhinoceros, spotted dear, hog deer, wild pig, etc.

#### **Trade and Commerce**

- The cities like Mohenjodaro, Harappa and Lothal were the important centres for **metallurgy**, producing **tools** and **weapons** as well as **kitchenware**.
- **Rice** seems to have been imported to Punjab from Gujarat.
- Lothal and Surkotada filled a large gap in the growing demands for **cotton**.
- Sea-shells were exported from Balakot and Lothal to Baluchistan as well as the Indus.
- **Dates**, **Shilajeet** were found at Mohenjodaro.
- The Harappans imported **metals** and semi precious **stones**, **ornaments** of gold and silver from the subcontinental areas like Lapis Lazuli from Kashmir and Afghanistan
- **Turquoise** and **jade** from Central Asia or gran, amethyst from Maharashtra and agate, Chalcedony and Carnelian from Saurashtra.
- *Gold, silver, Tin and Lead were imported from Iran and Afghanistan*. Precious stones were imported from Badakhanshan and *copper from Khetri (Rajasthan)*.

- The Products of Indus have been found in Mesopotamia. Its seals and products were also discovered at Sumer.
- The chief merchandise *cotton* was *exported from Lothal Harbour*. The Harappan had trading relations with the West and Central Asian sites.

### **Trade Mechanism**

- A copper scale has been found from Harappa. This scale is divided into many parts. All the parts are same in size measuring 0.3676 inch. At that time one foot are equal to 13.2 inch.
- T*he sexagesimal and decimal system were known to the Harappans*.
- The weights were made of stone and they were of cubical and spherical in shape. They followed the series in doubling from 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 and then 160, 320, 640 and so forth. The smallest weights are found of 13.64 grams.
- The unit of ratio was 16 equivalent to 13.64 grams. *16 chhatank made a ser and 16 annas made one rupee*.

### **Crafts and Industries**

- **Weaving** was the chief industry at Mohenjodaro.
- **Pottery** was an important industry. They were also acquainted with the **art of dying** and the art of **smelting**  metals.
- Balakot and Chanhudaro were for shell working and **Bangle** making Charnnudaro was centre for the manufacture of **beads** of carnelian.
- **Bronze Smiths** produced images, utensils, tools and weapons.
- **Brick-laying** was an important craft of that time.
- The Harappans had the knowledge of **boat-making**, **sealmaking** and terracotta manufacturing.
- The Harappans had experts beadmakers and Goldsmiths

### **Transport and Communications**

- Harappans had good transporting system for trade.
- They used **bullock carts** and rarely horse carts for onland journey.
- They practised **navigation** on the coast of the Arabian sea. Representation of **ships** and **boats** are found on seals or graffiti at Harappa, Mohenjodaro, etc. and a terracotta model of a ship comes from Lothal.
- *Caravans of pack-oxen were* the chief means of transport for longer journeys through rougher and wooded country.

## **Language and Script**

• The language of the Harappan is still unknown. The number of **pictoral signs** in the script vary according to different archaeologists. For examples G.R. Hunter (1932)-149 signs, A. H.Dani (1963) - 537, Asko Parpola (1973)-396, etc. Those symbols were not alphabetic in their order.

- Their language is closer to **Dravidian** than to any other known languages.
- Their scripts were pictographic.
- The script was written **from right to left** like modern **urdu**. These scripts are found on various seals, pottery copper tablets, tools, etc.
- The script is not related to any of the contemporary Egyption, Sumerian or Babylonian script. Some scholars call it the parent of the Brahmi Script.
- All the inscriptions discovered till now are short, with an average of half a dozen letters, the longest has seventeen. It will be a turning point in the history of India when this Indus script is deciphered.

# **Social Life**

### **Social Hierarchy**

- Indus people believed in simple living and high thinking.
- Traditional family was the unit of the society.
- Women were given high honour in society. Family was regulated in the name of mother.
- The Indus Civilization had four different classes in which the *society was divided* - *Scholars*, *warriors*, *businessman and labourers*.
- No evidence of caste system has been found yet.

#### **Food habits**

- The Harappans were *non-vegetarians*. Wheat, barley and bread were commonly used. They used to eat *fish*, *beef*, *mutton*, *poultry* occasionally.
- Coconut, dates, pomegranate, lemon and watermelon were the chief fruits they ate.

### **Entertainment**

- They preferred indoor hobbies to outdoor amusements.
- **Dance** and **music** were their popular amusements.
- Dices, chess, fishing, hunting and swimming were the sources of entertainment.
- Gambling was also in vogue.
- On some occasions they made animals or birds fight together for their entertainment.
- Marble dolls and animals toys show that the children of Mohenjodaro were well supplied with playthings.

#### **Costumes, ornaments and Jewellery**

- The ladies were scantily dressed. They wore a short skirt that reached up to the knee; and it was held by a girdle - a string of beads.
- The male used a *robe* with or without embroidery. It was worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm.
- *Dhoti* wearing was also in practice. Perhaps they did not use footware. Cotton was used. There is no evidence of linen or wool.
- Different types of **hair styles** were used but very long beards were not preferred. The dancing girl from Mohenjodaro has a pony tail. Some females have a plait tied with a bow at the end.
- Men's hair was parted in the middle and tied with a fillet. Sometimes the hair was gathered up in a bun or coiled in a ring on top of the head.
- Beards were trimmed and upper lips were shaven. Completely shaven faces with a small beard on the chin are also noticed.
- Mirrors of bronze were very common.
- The people followed the **veil system** in the society. Women used a special clothe over their heads which were flying from the backside of their heads.
- Man and woman both were fond of **ornaments**. Women wore a fan-shaped head-dress. Small cones of Gold, Silver, Copper and Faience were worn on the sides of the head.
- The Forehead was decorated with a **fillet** or a **headband**. **Ear-rings** were made of coils of gold, silver, copper or faience. Probably no nose ornaments were used.
- Necklaces, fillets, armlets, finger rings and bangles were used by both the sexes.
- Girdles, nose -studs, ear-studs, anklet, etc. may have been worn by woman only as are proved by the statues.
- They used some sorts of collyrium, face-powders, lip-sticks, face paints and perfumary which were also exported.

# **Political life**

- Urbanization represents radical socio-political change.
- Harappan political system was organised on the pattern of '*city states*', which were highly disciplined on account of dominant social controls.
- Harappan rulers were more concerned with commerce, than with conquests, and Harappa was possibly ruled by a class of merchants.
- Harappa was ruled by the two capital cities. The distance between the two capitals was 350 mile.
- Sir Mortimer Wheeler writes, "the lords of Harappa administered their city in the fashion not remote from that of the priest-kings or governors of Sumer and Akkad.

## **LINKS WITH OTHER CIVILIZATIONS**

• Harappans had close trade relations with submarine. The Sumerian Civilization was a part of Mesopotamian Civilization. Mangol and Dravid were the progeniar of Sumer. The presence of a cuneiform inscription at Mohenjodaro witnesses the links with the Mesopotamians (area between Dajla and Furat).

## **DECLINE OF INDUS CIVILIZATION**

- The Harappan Culture lasted for around 1000 years.
- *Invasion of the Aryans*, Mortimer Wheeler says, destroyed the Indus settlements.
- Men and women were massacred in the streets and houses.
- They were left lying covered without last rites.
- *E. J. H. Mackay*, Lambric and John Marshall are of the view that the decline of the Harappan Civilization was mainly due to the vagaries of the Indus river.
- Some evidence of devastation by floods is to be found at Mohenjodaro and Lothal.
- According to Thus, numerous causes, natural and human, as the **invasion of nomadic** outsiders (B.C. 1500), flood, social breakup of Harappans, the decline in trade and commerce were the major causes of its decline.

# **SURVIVAL AND CONTINUITY OF THE INDUS CIVILIZATION**

The decline does not mean the total eclipse of all. For this, we can find the historical continuity from the Harappan period to the later periods of Indian history.

- The **worship** of '**Pashupati Shiva**' and '**Lingam**' is survived in these days.
- Similarly Mother Goddess, sacred tree, animals, serpent, different religious symbols such as Swastik, etc. which were prevalent in the Harappan religion, were adopted in later Hinduism and are in Vogue in present time.
- In the field of **Science and Technology**, the Indus Civilization greatly contributed to the similar future developments.
- Harappan civilization was the *womb of mathematics*.
- The **numerical** and *decimal system* were evolved there from which 'the vedic mathematics' is based.
- **Punch marked** coins is an important survival of the Indus Valley.
- The art of making pottery, baked bricks, beads, jewellery, different utensils, was adopted in the vedic civilization.
