# Introduction

Janapada literally means the place where the people put their feet. However, these were permanent settlements of the agricultural communities of the later vedic period. The term *Mahajanapad was used to describe a large area capable of bearing taxes and various imposition*. Several Janapadas included in a Mahajanpada. There were several thousand villages in a Janapada. The Kautilyan Janapada comprised 3200 villages..

# **ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENTS OF MAHAJANAPADAS**

### **Boundary and Army**

- Most of Mahajanapadas had a **capital city** and were fortified.
- It means the entire areas were surrounded by huge walls of wood, brick or stones.
- The **objectives** of building forts were to protect the people and the kingdom from the attacks of other kings.
- To show how rich and powerful they were by building large, tall and impressive walls around their cities
- To control the land and the people living inside the fortified area more easily.
- The rajas maintained armies to protect the people and the fort.
- The people lived in **huts**, and kept **cattle** as well as other animals.

- They used to grow a variety of crops like rice, wheat, barley, pulses, sugarcane, sesame and mustard.
- They knew making **earthen pots**, some were in grey and red colours.
- Some painted grey pots of **geometric pattern** are found.

In transition from tribe to monarchy they lost the essential democratic pattern of the tribe but retained the idea of government through an assembly representing the tribes. These states consisted of either a single tribe such as the Shakyas, Kolia, Mallas, etc. or a confederacy of tribes such as the Vrijis, Yadavas, Panchala, etc.

The people in the lower Ganges Valley and Delta were outside the Aryan boundary were considered as *mlecchas*. There was a strong consciousness of the purity of the Aryans called *Aryavarta*. Each janapada tried to dominate and subjugate other janapadas to beome Mahajanapads.

### **Economic Life**

#### **Taxes of Mahajanapada**

The rulers needed **more resources** for building **huge forts** and maintaining **big armies**. So, they started collecting regular

• The changes in economic and social events led in coexistent of religious thought.

- The creation of awakened groups of traders, industrialists and labour resulted in putting a challenge to the supremacy of the Brahmanas.
- The creation of sub-castes also did the same.
- Several of these groups were rich as well which gave them an advantageous position in the society. It led to religious awakening in the society which **caused** the **formation of several religious sects**.

taxes, instead of depending on occasional gifts brought by people which was in the case of the raja of janapadas. These taxes were collected from :

- (i) **Farmers** on their **crop** production,
- (ii) **Crafts** persons in the form of labour,
- (iii) **Herders** in the form of animals and **animal** produce,
- (iv) **Traders** on goods that were brought and sold,
- (v) **Hunters** and gatherers on forest produce.

#### **New Methods in Agriculture**

There were two changes adopted in the practice of agriculture, that were:

- (i) They used **iron ploughshare** at the place of wooden ploughshare. Its motive was to turn over the heavy clayey soil better to produce more grain.
- (ii) People started developing **nursery of paddy** instead of scattering seed on the ground for final croping. In this nursery plants were sprouted, saplings were grown and then planted in the fields to increase production.

# **CAUSES OF RISE OF NEW CULTURE AND RELIGIONS** • There is no doubt that the **rise of Jainism** and **Buddhism**

- during this period was a result of the **changed economic** and **social circumstances** also.
- We also find that both of these religious sects got support from the **neo-rich trading** and **industrial classes** which were eager to get a better social status so far denied to them.
- The same way, both Jainism and Buddhism drew large converts from new sub-castes who were interested in getting equal status for all castes thereby getting the facility of having better social status for themselves.

### **DIFFERENT MAHAJANAPADAS**

There were about sixteen Mahajanapadas (about 2500 years ago) according to *Anguttara Nikaya* in the sixth century B.C. namely:

(ii) **Anga** (including the present districts of Monghyr and Bhagalpur in Bihar) with its capital at **Champa**. (iii) **Vajji** (a confederacy of eight republican clans. To the north of the river Ganga in Bihar) with its capital, **Vaisali**.

### **Important Janapadas Union (Republic)**

*Republican Manajanapada* was ruled by a group of representatives elected by the common people. The Mahajanapadas of Vrijji, Mall, Kuru, Panchal and Kamboj were republican states and so were either smaller states like Lichhavi, Shakya, Kolya, Bhagga, and Moriya. All the administrative decisions of the states were taken by the *Parisha*. The republics were basically of two types:

- (a) The republics comprising a **single tribe** like those of the Sakyas, the Kolias and the Mallas.
- (b) The republics comprising a number of tribes or the republics of **confederacy** like the Vrijjis.

### **Emergence of Magadha**

The first important king of Magadha was **Bimbisara** (542 B.C. – 493 B.C.) who belonged to the *Haryanka dynasty*. He **strengthened his position by marriage alliances**. He took three wives. His first wife was the daughter of the king Kosala and the sister of Prasenajit. His second wife Chellana was a Lichhavi Princess from Vaishali, and his third wife was the daughter of the chief of the Madra clan of Punjab.

- Marriage relations with the different princely families gave enormous diplomatic prestige and paved the way for the expansion of Magadha westward and northward.
- The earliest capital of Magadha was at *Rajgir*, which was called *Girivraja* at that time. It was surrounded by **five hills**, the openings in which were closed by stone walls on all sides. This made Rajgir invincible.
- He was succeeded by his son *Ajatasatru* (*492–460 B.C.*)
- Ajatasatru killed his father and seized the throne for himself. Throughout his *reign*, he pursued an aggressive policy of expansion.
- Ajatasatru was succeeded by *Udayin* (*460 444 B.C.*). His reign was important because he **built the fort** upon the confluence of the Ganga and Son at Patna. This was done because Patna lay in the centre of the Magadhan kingdom.
- Udayin was succeeded by the dynasty of *Sisunagas*, who temporarily shifted the capital to *Vaishali*. Their greatest achievement was the destruction of the power of Avanti with its capital at Ujjain. This brought to an end the 100 years old rivalry between Magadha and Avanti.

### **Causes for the Rise of Magadha**

- Advantageous **geographical location** either at Rajgir or Pataliputra situated at strategic locations.
- Advantageous **natural resources** such as **iron** enable Magadhan rulers to equip with **effective weapons**.
- The **alluvial soil** of Gangetic plains and sufficient rainfall was very conducive for **agriculture produces**.
- Rise of town and **use of metallic money** boosted trade and commerce.
- The princes could use **tools** and accumulate **wealth to** pay and **maintain their army**.
- Use of **elephants** on a large scale **in wars**.
- **Liberal** (Unorthodox) **character** of Magadhan society.
- Contribution of several enterprising and ambitious rulers.

### **VARIOUS INVASIONS**

### **Iranian Invasion**

The *Achaemenid rulers of Iran*, who spreaded their kingdom at the same time as the Magadhan princes, took advantage of the political disunity on the north-west frontier. The Iranian ruler, *Darius* penetrated into north-west India in 516 B.C. and annexed Punjab, west of the Indus, and Sindh. It gave a momentum to Indo-Iraninan trade and commerce. The Iraninan scribes brought into India a form of writing which came to be known as the *Kharoshi script*. It was written from right to left *like the Arabic*. Iranian coins are also found in the north-west region which points to the existence of trade with Iran. Iranian effect on the Maurya sculpture is clearly noticeable. The monuments of Ashokas time, especially the bell shaped capitals owed something to the Iranian models. Iranian influence may also be witnessed in the preamble of Ashoka's edicts as well as in certain words used in them.

### Points to Remember

- In *516 B.C. Darius* sent a naval expedition to explore the valley of the river Indus.
- He marked the province as *20th Straphy*, which was considered to be the richest and the most populous province of the Persian Empire.
- Its annual tribute amounted to 360 Euboic talents of gold-dust.
- The Kharoshi script was used on the north-western frontier since then until about 4th century A.D.

## **Alexander's Invasion**

In the fourth century B.C., the Greeks and the Iranians fought for the supremacy of the world. **Alexander**, the king of **Macedonia Grecce** conquered not only Asia Minor and Iraq but also Iran. From Iran, he moved on to India, obviously **attracted by its great wealth**.

Alexander defeated Indian rulers one after another. Among the rulers of these territories, two were well-known *Ambhi*, the prince of Taxila, and *Porus* whose kingdom lay between the Jhelum and the Chenab.

After the victory of Iran, Alexander reached to Kabul, from where he marched to India through the *Khyber Pass*.

Ambhi, the ruler of Taxila, readily submitted to the invader, augmented his army and replenish his treasure.

When he reached the Jhelum, Alexander met the first and the **strongest resistance** from **Porus**. Although Alexander defeated Porus, he was impressed by the bravery and courage of the Indian prince. So, he restored his kingdom to him and made him his ally.

Then, he advanced as far as the *Beas river*. He wanted to move still further eastward but his army refused to accompany him.

*Alexander remained in India for 19 months (326–325 B.C.)*, which were full of fighting. He had barely any time to organize his conquests. Still, he made some arrangements. Most conquered states were restored to their rulers who submitted to his authority.

But his own territorial possessions were divided into three parts, which were placed under three Greek governors.

One of the most remarkable aspects of Alexander's foreign policy was his encouragement of **inter-racial marriages**.

He dreamt of **uniting the east and the west** by the natural bonds of marriage, and ruling over it.

# **Results of Alexander's Invasion**

- Alexander's campaign opened up and reinforces a number of trade routes between north-western India, via Afghanistan and Iran to Asia Minor and to the ports along the eastern Mediterranean.
- The date of Alexander's campaign noted clearly in the chronicles left by the historians has helped establish the

chronological order of subsequent events in India. It also opened a new door for Greek art and architecture.

• Thus, Alexander paved the way for the rise of a united empire under the Mauryas.

#### **Summary of Alexander's Invasion**

- Alexander marched to India through the **Khyber Pass in 326 B.C**.
- **Ambi**, the ruler of Taxila, submitted to Alexander.
- He was bravely checked by the local chieftains despite the fact that they had no chance of success.
- He was resisted first strongest by Porus at Jhelum.
- His advance was checked on the bank of the Beas because of the mutiny of his soldiers.
- In 325 B.C., he began his homeward journey.
- In 324 B.C., he reached Susa in Persia and died the next year.
- The Greek invasion of India opened the trade route between north-west India and Western Asia.
