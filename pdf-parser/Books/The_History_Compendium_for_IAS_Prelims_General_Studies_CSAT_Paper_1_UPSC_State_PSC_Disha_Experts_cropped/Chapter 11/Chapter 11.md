# UNIT-II : MEDIEVAL HISTORY OF INDIA

![](_page_0_Picture_1.jpeg)

## Introduction

During the medieval times in India, there have been developed important milestones in the field of religion, folk art and language. The medieval period of Indian history comprises a long period, spanning from 8th century, *i.e.* after the fall of the Gupta Empire to the 18th century, *i.e.* the beginning of colonial domination. Modern historians, divided the medieval period into *Early Medieval Period and Late Medieval Period*.

Early Medieval period refers to the phase of Indian history that stretches from the fall of the Gupta Empire to the beginning of the Sultanate period in the 13th century.

Late Medieval period comprises mainly that of the reigns of the Sultanate and the Mughal period.

## **SOURCES OF THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD**

Historians depend on a variety of sources such as inscriptions, buildings, coins, and non-religious literature. The medieval period also has the first good example of written records of history which give us a better insight into the period.

Broadly we can divide the sources of history into two groups: 1. Archaeological 2. Literary

## **1. Archaeological Sources**

- The archaeological sources are of immense value in the reconstruction of the socio - cultural and political history of medieval India.
- The archaeological sources include *fossil remains, artifacts, tools and implements, edicts and inscriptions, monuments, coins*.
- Archaeologists use them to reconstruct the past.

Let us briefly understand about each of the archaeological sources.

#### **Fossil Remains**

- Fossils are basically imprints of plants, animals or humans preserved in rocks.
- These have been buried for millions of years.
- These imprints are usually made from hard body parts such as bones or skulls, which leave a permanent mark on the rock.
- Fossils are the main source of information on the species that have become extinct, for example, dinosaurs.

#### **Monuments**

- Monuments are ancient buildings and structures such as temples, mosques, tombs, palaces and forts.
- They throw light on the social, religious and cultural life of the people of the age when they were built, rebuilt, repaired or altered.
- *• Sanchi Stupa* in *Madhya Pradesh* is an important *Buddhist* monument. The stupa provides information of historical significance. It was originally built of bricks during Ashoka's time. It was expanded and remade of stones during the *Sunga Period*.
- An inscription on the southern gate was donated by *King Satakarni*. The northern gate and the panels depict stories from the Jatakas.

#### **Artifacts**

- Artifacts such as tools and implements, ornaments, and pottery have been found in various archaeological findings.
- They tell us about the kind of life people lived, their occupation and their social condition.

#### **Inscriptions**

- Inscriptions are the written records engraved on stones, pillars, clay or copper tablets, caves, and walls of the temples and monuments.
- They are reliable sources of information about the history of any period.

- They provide us names of the kings, the adminstration of the kingdom, some important events, the extent of the kingdom, etc.
- The *Ashoka inscriptions* and the *Allahabad pillar inscriptions* tell us a great deal about the reign of *Ashoka and Samudragupta*.

The inscriptions of the Mauryan king *Ashoka* are the earliest inscriptions in India.

#### **Coins**

- Coins belonging to this period are a valuable source for reconstructing dates of historical events.
- They also give us an idea of the economic conditions of that period.
- They help us to ascertain the territorial extent and reign of the rulers.
- They also provide valuable personal information about rulers, such as their religion, For example, *Samudragupta's* coins tell us that he was a good veena player.
- Monuments and paintings are also important archaeological sources of the period.

### **2. Literary Sources**

- One of distinct features of the sources of the medieval period is that the number and variety of literary or textural records increased noticeably during this period.
- Literates and chroniclers wrote chronicles of rulers, petitions, judicial records, accounts and taxes.
- The teachings of saints and traders transaction were also recorded on these papers.
- The medieval chronicles were written by contemporary authors who were either court historians or freelancers. There are three types of literary sources.
- (i) Manuscript (ii) Language
- (iii) Religious and non-religious literature.

#### **Manuscripts**

- The early literary records were handwritten. They are called manuscripts.
- Manuscripts were written on palm leaves, the bark of birch trees, and later on paper.
- Over the years, many of these manuscripts got destroyed, some of them are still preserved in temples, monasteries and archives.
- They throw light on the social and economic life, religious beliefs, practices and cultures of the past.

#### **Language**

- The language of ancient Indian literature depends on the region where it was written.
- Some of the languages included *Prakrit, Pali, Sanskrit or Tamil*.

• On the other hand, *Silappadikaram* and *Manimekalai* were written in *Tamil* since they were written in Tamil speaking areas of south India.

#### **Religious Literature**

- The *Vedas* and the *Puranas* contain details of rituals, prayers and religious practices of the Ancient past.
- They are classified as sacred or religious literary sources.

- Early medieval period is marked by the presence of a large number of regional and local powers in the absence of a paramount power in the country.
- This period has been characterized by certain historians as '*regional imperial kingdoms*'.
- The essential points of eary-medieval India may be highlighted as :
  - 1. Political Decentralization
  - 2. Emergence of landed Intermediaries
  - 3. Naturalisation of Economy
  - 4. Subjection of the Peasantry
  - 5. Proliferation of castes
  - 6. Formation of Regional cultural units
  - 7. Feudal Dimension of the Ideology and Culture.

#### **Kannauj**

In the post-Gupta period, **Kannauj** became the centre of political activities in North India. The political unity crumbled on Harsha's death and was followed by a period of anarchy and confusion in Northern India. A number of petty principalities and independent kingdoms rose on the ruins of the empire of Harsha.

**Chachnama** a work of rather late period, mentions four kings ruling at Kannauj during a period of seventy years following the death of Harsha. These four kings were *Rasil Rai, Sayar, Sahiras and Rai Harachander*.

## **Yashovarman**

A famous monarch named Yashovarman defeated many kings, which included the king of the *Magadha*, *Vanga*, *Parasika*,

#### **Non-Religious Literature**

- The historical accounts and biographies written by poets and foreign travellers form part of Non-religious or regular literature.
- They were written to record events, rules of the contemporary society and administrative regulations.
- *• Kautilya's Arthashastra*, accounts of the foreign travellers such as India written by the Greek ambassador *Megasthenes* in the court of *Chandragupta Maurya*, and the writings of Chinese travellers *Fa-Hien* and *Hiuen - Tsang* are considered as secular literature.
- They describe the political, social and economic life of a certain period.

## **EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA (AD 750-1200)**

*Shrikantha* and *Harishchandra*. He is supposed to have founded the city named **Yashovarmapura**.

Yashovarman could not enjoy the rule of his vast empire, extending from north Bengal to N-W frontier province, for long. **Lalithadithya**, the king of Kashmir (about 750 AD) grew jealous of Yashovarman's power and attacked Kannauj (Gadhipura) and finally uprooted Yashovarman.

The **Rajatarangini** mentions that the poets *Vakpatiraja*, *Bhavabhuti* and others adorned the court of Yashorvarman. **Malatimadhava**, **Mahaviracharita** and **Uttararamacharita**, three well-known Sanskrit plays were written by Bhavabhuti.

## **Ayudhas-Three rulers of Kannauj**

After Yashovarman's dynasty, the last three rulers **Ama, Dunduka and Bhoja**. (belonging to the same lineage-Ayudhas) ruled for a very short period. During this period the struggle for Kannauj seems to have begun.

**Vajrayudha** was the first king who was defeated by **Jayapida Vinayaditya** of Kashmir. **Dhruva Rashtrakita invaded the Doab and defeated the Kannauj king Indrayudha**. Indrayudha was also defeated by Dharmapala of Bengal.

## **Kannauj and the Tripartite struggle**

The tripartite struggle had started between *the Palas, the Pratiharas and the Rashtrakutas* for the control of Kannauj and North India.

The tripartite struggle continued for nearly a century and ended in favour of the Gurjara-Pratihara ruler **Nagabhata II**  who founded the Gurjara-Pratihara kingdom at Kannauj.

## **EMERGENCE OF NEW KINGDOM [AD 700-1200]**

During the period AD 700 - 1200, denoted as the early medieval peirod, a number of powerful regional kingdoms arose in north India, the Deccan and South India. All these kingdoms had the desire to build an empire and, therefore, continually fought with each other to gain control over their neighbouring territories.

The Palas were dominant in eastern India, whereas the Gurjara - Pratiharas dominated western India and the upper Gangetic Valley. The third major kingdom was that of the Rashtrakutas who controlled the Deccan and also the territories in Northern and Southern India at different times. A number of Rajput kingdoms also emerged during this period and among them the *Chahamanas or Chauhans* were the most prominent. In the south, *the Cholas* surfaced as the most powerful kingdom and became known for a distinct administrative structure and agrarian expansion.

## **The Pallavas**

During the period of Pallavas, the Pallavas and the Chalukyas had established powerful empires in South India. The Pallavas are mentioned in *Samudragupta's pillar*, where he is said to have defeated a Pallava king, *Vishnugopa*. The Pallavas were powerful between 330 and 550 AD. Their main area of dominance was *Kanchipuram,*, their capital, up to the *Kaveri Delta*. After Vishnugopa's defeat by Samudragupta, the Pallavas became weaker and the *Cholas and the Kalabhras* repeatedly attacked the Pallava kingdom and robbed it of its wealth and territories. It was *Simhavishnu* son of *Simhavarma* II, who eventually crushed the dominance of the Kolabhras in AD 575 and re-established his kingdom. Although both the Pallava and Pandya kingdoms were enemies, the real struggle for political domination was between the *Pallavas and Chalukyas*. The Pallavas' history between 600 and 900 AD is full of accounts of wars between the Pallavas and the Chalukyas.

## **The Chalukyas**

The incidence of grants to state officials varies from one region to another. The dynasty had two branches - *Vatapi* and *Kalyani*. The earlier rulers of this dynasty were *Jayasingha*  and *Rameraja*. The Chalukyan kings were great patrons of art and letters. Most of the *Ajanta and Ellora paintings* were completed during this period. The famous scholars of their times include *Bilhana* a Sanskrit writer of works such as *Vikramaskadeva Charita* and the poem *Chaurapanchesika and Vijnanesvara* who wrote the *Mitaksara*.

The Chalukyas were largely influential in the area around *Raichur Doab* between *Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers*. Their capital was *Aihole* which was also an important trading centre. The famous ruler of this dynasty was *Pulakesin I*, who was the first independent ruler of Badami with *Vatapi in Bijapur* as its capital. He was succeeded by *Kirthivaraman I* and *Pulakesin II*. *Pulakesin II*, the grandson of Pulakesin I, was a contemporary of *Harshvardhana* and the most famous of the Chalukyan kings. He expanded his kingdom by annexing the entire Andhra Kingdom. His reign is remembered as the greatest period in the history of Karnataka. He defeated Harshavardhana on the banks of the river Narmada. *Ravikriti* was the court poet of Pulakesin II, who composed the *Aihole Inscription*.

This inscription gives a vivid account of the Chalukyan rule.

#### **The Rashtrakutas**

The term '*Rashtrakutas*' means designated officers - in charge of territorial divisions called ' Rashtra'. They were feudatories under the *Chalukyas of Badami*. The founder of the Rashtrakuta kingdom was *Dantivarman or Dantidurga*, who after defeating the Chalukyas king *Kirti Varman* in the early eight century wrested from him the greater portion of the Deccan.

*Dantivarman* was succeeded in A.D. 750 by his uncle *Krishna I*, Who gave the final blow to the power of the Chalukyas of Badami, attacked the *Gangas of Mysore* and forced the *Chalukyas of Vengi* to acknowledge his supremacy. His son Govinda II was dethroned by his younger brother *Dhruva* in A.D. 779.

#### **Their Cultural Contribution**

- The ascendancy of the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan constitutes one of the most brilliant chapters in the history of the Deccan.
- They were tolerant in religious matters and patronised not only Shaivism and Vaishnavism, but Jainism as well.
- The Rashtrakutas were even tolerant of Islam. They permitted the Muslim merchants to settle, build their mosques and preach their religion in the Rashtrakutas.
- Their tolerant policies gave great impetus to trade and commerce.
- In the field of literature also their tolerant spirit is visible.
- They equally patronised Sanskrit, Prakrit, Apabhransa, forerunner of many modern Indian languages, and Kannada.
- They patronised the arts liberally.
- The rock-cut cave temples at Ellora are the symbols of their religious toleration and are one of the splendours of Indian art.
- *• The Kailash Temple*, built by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna I, is an unrivalled and stupendous piece of art. The ancient Indian rock - cut architecture reached its zenith under the Rashtrakutas.

## **The Cholas**

The Cholas or Chodas, as rulers, are known to have existed from remote antiquity. According to II and XIII *Rock Edicts of Ashoka*, the earliest historical documents to refer to the Cholas, they were a friendly power in the south beyond the pale of Mauryan Suzerainty. The Chola dynasty ruled over *Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka*. *Tanjore* was its capital city. The Cholas disappeared only to resurface in 850AD when *Vijayalaya* captured Tanjore and made it his capital. However, during the rule of *Rajaraja* I and his son *Rajendra* I the Cholas entered their most glorious phase. They expanded the kingdom beyond south India to *Sri Lanka, Java and Sumatra*.

By his ability, prowess and military skill, *Rajaraja I* defeted the *Cheras* and seized *Madurai*. He invaded *Sri Lanka* and annexed its northern part which became a Chola Province under the name *Mummadi Cholaman Dalam*. Rajaraja I then overran the eastern Chalukyas who eventually accepted his authority Rajaraja I constructed the beautiful *Shiva temple* at *Thanjavur*, called *Rajarajesvara temple.* An account of Rajaraja I's exploits is engraved on the walls of the temple.

His son *Rajendra I*, by his military valour and administrative talents, raised the Chola empire to a pinnacle of glory. He annexed the whole of Sri Lanka and reasserted the Chola supremacy over Kerala and the Pandhyan country. His army marched triumphantly up to river Ganga and the dominions of the Pala king, *Mahipala*.

He adopted the title of *Gangaikonda* and founded a new capital called *Gangaikonda Cholapuram* in *Tiruchirapalli* district. The Chola monarch's achievements were not limited to land only. He had a powerful naval fleet which gained successes across the Bay of Bengal. It is said that he also sent expeditions to *Java and Sumatra*, presumably to further commercial relations between the *Malaya Peninsula and south India*.

#### **The Chola Administration King and The Ministers**

- The king was the head of the state. He discharged his duties and responsibilities with the help of ministers and other high officers.
- The inscriptions of the Cholas prove that their system of administration was highly organised and efficient.
- Apart from the ruler (**Tiruvakya Kelvi**) there was a ministerial council and an organised administrative staff.
- The ruler maintained close contact with the council of ministers and royal tours contributed to the efficiency of the administration.
- The officers were paid by land assignments. They were honoured and encouraged by conferring titles.
- The higher officials enjoyed the tittle of *Penundaram*, and the lower ones *Sirutaram*.
- The Cholas also constructed roads which helped in trade, commerce and communication.

#### **Revenue**

Revenue was derived mainly from land and Collected in kind, or in cash, or in both, by village assemblies. Land was possessed by individuals and communities. The state's share of land revenue was fixed at *1/3rd of the produce* after an elaborate land survey in the time of *Rajaraja I*. There were periodical revisions of the classifications of land and of the assessment of land revenue. Other sources of public income were *customs and tolls*, taxes on various kinds of professions, *mines, forests*, *saltpans*, etc. Failure to pay the land revenue involved sale of the land in question, including temple lands.

#### **Irrigation**

Agricultural property was ensured by the special attention given to irrigation by the government as well as local authorities. Village assemblies were responsible for maintaining tanks in good condition and for reclaiming forest and wastelands. The Cholas spent huge amounts on buildings canals, tanks, dams and wells. **Rajendra I** dug an artificial lake near his new capital, **Gangaikonda Cholapuram**.

#### **Army**

The army consisted of elephants, cavalry and infantry. Attention was given to training and discipline of the cantonments. It was composed chiefly of *Kaikkolas or Sengundar*.

The commanders enjoyed the rank of *nayaka senapati*, *or mahadandanayaka*. The Cholas under *Rajaraja* Controlled the *Coromandel and Malabar* coast and the *Bay of Bengal*.

#### **Village Administration**

- The village was the primary unit of society and Polity. The village assemblies held the society together through its unique feature of autonomy and self-sufficiency.
- From the *Uttaramerur inscriptions* we find reference to at least three types of assemblies which played a regular part in local administration, namely the *Ur*, *Sabha or Mahasabha* and *Nagaram*.

- The *Ur* was an assembly of common villages where the land was held by all classes of people who were, therefore, entitled to membership in the local assembly.
- The *Sabha* was an exclusively Brahmin assembly of the *Brhamadeya* villages where all the land belonged to the Brahmins.
- The *Nagaram* was an assembly of merchants and belonged to localities where traders and merchants were in a dominant position.
- The *Sabha*, generally comprised the elite or learned in the community, commanded the respect of all the other assemblies in settling crucial matters of common concern.
- *• The Uttaramerur inscription belonged to the reign of the Chola monarch Parantaka I (10th century)*

#### **Chola Temples**

Under the Chola, temples became the centre of life. They were not only places of worship but also emerged as the *hub of economic, political and cultural activities*. The village assembly held its meetings in the temple mandapa or hall. Temples also grew as centres of craft especially the creation of bronze images which was the most distinctive. Many cultural activities like music and dance also prepared in the temples. The Chola records frequently refer to *Devadana gifts of land*. Temple architecture, particularly the *Dravida or south Indian style of architecture*, reached its peak under the Cholas. The chief feature of a Chola temple is the *Vimana or the tower*, which was later eclipsed by the richly ornamented *gopuram or gateway*. In the *Brihadeswara* or *Rajarajesvara* temple dedicated to Siva, the Vimana or tower is about 57 metres high upon a square, comprising thirteen successive stories. It is crowned by a single block of granite, 7.5 metres high and about 80 tonnes in weight. Similarly, *Rajendra* I erected a splendid temple at his new capital, *Gangaiskonda Cholapuram*.

Some Chola temples at *Thanjavur and Kalohasti* contain beautiful royal portraits. The metal and stone images cast during the period are exquistite. The masterpiece of Chola sculpture is the famous *Nataraja or the Dancing Siva* image at the great temple of *Chidambaram*. This Nataraja has been described as the 'cultural epitome' of the Chola period. The Cholas also patronised paintings. The most important Chola paintings are those in the *Pradakshinapath* of the *Rajarajesvara temple*.

## **The Cheras**

The **Chera** Dynasty was one of the important dynasties in India. The Cheras were able to establish their rule before the **Sangam Age** and they ruled till the twelfth century. During the Sangam Age, the Chera rulers were known by many titles including Malaiyar, Villavar and Vanavar. There were two important lines of the Cheras – first initiated from **Uthiyan Cheralathan** while the second line starts from **Irumporai**.

Based on historical evidences, it is believed that the Cheras developed friendly relations with the Cholas and concluded matrimonial alliances with them, but soon supported the Pandya rulers against Cholas. However, their allied forces were defeated by the army of the Chola king in the Battle of Venni. After this defeat, the Chera ruler **Uthiyan Cheralathan** committed suicide.

**H-134** Medieval Period

The Cheras were successful in developing trade relations with Rome. **Muziris**, a famous sea-port in the ancient India, was an essential part of their kingdom. Through this sea-port, *spices, timber, pearls, ivory and gems* were exported from India to the Middle East and southern Europe. Many historical evidences suggest extensive foreign trade from the coasts of *Karur, Malabar and Coimbtore*. There are also legends that the Romans constructed a temple of Augustus at the port city of Muziris.

The Cheras were tolerant to all religions and faiths. In their reign, immigrants belonging to *Jewish, Christian and Muslim* faiths established their communities as the **Juda Mappila**, the **Nasrani Mappila** and the **Muslim Mappila** respectively. The Chera king, **Nedunjeral Adan**, attacked Yavana ships and captured Yavana traders for ransom. Nedunjeral Adan was succeeded by his son, **Senguttuvan**, who is remembered for his great conquests. Senguttuvan was successful in defeating his enemies. **Gajabahu**, a famous emperor from Sri Lanka, also mentioned about the conquests of Senguttuvan.

The second Chera Dynasty, known as the **Kulasekharas**, ruled from the outskirts of Muziris, situated on the bank of river **Periyar**. During their rule, they were in constant conflict with their neighbours and fought many battles against them. Finally, in twelfth century AD, continuous Chola invasions marked an end to their dynasty.

## **The Hoysalas**

Founded by '**Sala**', Hoysala dynasty existed between 1110 A.D. and 1326 A.D. **Vinayaditya** (1047-98) ruled the area centered on **Dorasamudra** (modern Halebid) – the capital city. His grandson **Bittiga**, later called **Vishnuvardhana** (reigned 1110-42) made extensive conquests and built magnificent temples at **Dorasamudra** that were noted for their intricate and elaborate sculpture. Bittiga's grandson, **Vira Ballala II** (reigned 1173-1220) extended Hoysala control North of Mysore and made the dynasty the most powerful in South India. The Hoysalas later came into conflict with the empire of Vijayanagar and the Muslim sultans of Delhi. The last Hoysala ruler was overthrown in 1346. At its peak, the dynasty ruled over parts of the modern states of *Mysore, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu.*

Some of the most magnificent temples are attributed to the Hoysala dynasty. Developed on the architectural style of the Chalukyas, these structures have intricate details. **The Belur temple**, built in 1117 A.D. to commemorate a victory against the Cholas, has a single star shaped structure, whereas **the Halebid temple** (1121 A.D.) has a double sanctum like a twin temple, one beside the other, with the side wings joined to allow access to each other. In *Halebid* the temples are dedicated to *Vishnuvardhana* and his consort *Santaleswara*. **The Somnathapura temple**, built in 1268, has three star shaped sanctums each placed at three angles.

## **The Gangas**

The Western Ganga Dynasty (350 – 1000 A.D.) was an important dynasty of India – known as *Western Gangas* to distinguish them from the *Eastern Gangas* who in later centuries ruled over modern Orissa. The Western Ganga initially ruled from **Kolar** and later moved their capital to **Talakad** on the banks of the *Kaveri* river in modern *Mysore* district.

After the rise of the imperial *Chalukyas of Badami*, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the *Pallavas of Kanchi*. The **Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta** replaced the Chalukyas in 753 A.D. as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the *Cholas of Tanjavur*. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around AD 1000 resulted in the end of the Ganga influence over the region.

The Western Gangas made an important contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region. The Western Ganga kings showed their patronage towards Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as **Shravanabelagola** and **Kambadahalli**. The kings of that dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished.

## **The Yadavas**

The **Yadava** dynasty, also known as the *Seuna Maratha dynasty*, was founded by **Seunachandra** in AD 850. The son of *Dridhaprahara*, at his zenith he ruled a vast kingdom stretching from the River Tungabhadra to the River Narmada, including modern Maharastra, the north of Karnataka, and parts of Madhya Pradesh, with capital at **Devagiri** (now *Daulatabad*) in Maharashtra.

Originally a feudatory of the *Eastern Chalukyas of Kalyani*, the dynasty became paramount in the *Deccan* under **Bhillama** (A.D. 1187–91). Under Bhillama's grandson **Singhana** (A.D. 1210–47) the dynasty reached its height, as the Yadava campaigned against the *Hoysalas in the south*, the *Kakatiyas in the east*, and the *Paramaras and Chalukyas in the north*.

During the reign of the last Yadava king, **Ramachandra** (A.D. 1271–1309), a Muslim army commanded by the Delhi sultan Ala- al-Din Khalji invaded the kingdom in 1294 and imposed tributary status. In a further attempt, his son and successor died in battle, and the kingdom was annexed by the *Khalji empire* in 1317.

## **The Kakatiyas**

The *Kakatiyas* ruled in Andhra Pradesh in India from A.D. 1083 to AD 1323. They were the first feudatories of the *Western Chalukyas of Kalyana*, ruling over a small territory near **Warangal**. Their rule is considered the most promising period of history of Telugu & Andhra Pradesh.

**Rudra** was a renowned ruler in Kakatiya Dynasty who ruled during AD 1158 to 1195. He stretched his empire till the *Godavari Delta*. To serve as a second capital, he constructed the fort at Warangal. **Ganapati** was the supreme king among all the rulers of Kakatiya dynasty. He played an important role in consolidation of *Telugu region* under one rule. He established a huge kingdom and promoted the trade practices in the kingdom. Ganapati did not have any son so his daughter **Rudramba** ascended the throne. Some of the generals who did not want to be dominated by Rudramba formed a different rebellion. She suppressed all kind of criticisms and moved with great courage to blow *the Cholas and Yadavas* tremendously. The successor of *Rudramba* was **Prataparuda**. He ruled in the period AD 1295-1323. He divided his army into seventy five '*Nayakships*'. Later the *Rayas of Vijayanagara* took over the Nayakships and made growth in great extent. During this period only the Muslims invaded the empire of Kakatiya Dynasty in Andhra Pradesh for the first time. The king of Delhi Sultanate **Ala-ud-din Khilji** sent his army in AD 1303. Another major invasion of Muslims took place in order to capture '*Tilling*', **Ghiaz-ud-din Tughlaq** the ruler of Tughlaq Dynasty sent his huge army under the leadership of *Ulguh Khan* during AD 1321. **Prataparuda** was defeated and was taken as a prisoner. This marked an end to the Kakatiya Dynasty.

## **Pala Empire**

#### **8th century - 12th century-**

The Pala Empire was a Buddhist imperial power in classical India during the 8th to 12th century CE. The empire is named after its ruling dynasty. All of whose rulers bore names ending with the suffix - Pala ("Protector"). The palas were often described by opponents as the *Lords of Gauda*. Their empire centered around the Present - day Bengal - Bihar region, and at times, included what are now Assam, Orissa and Parts of North India.

The Palas in comparison with other contemporary empires:-

The branch of the Pratiharas who ruled in the Gujarat were *the Gurjaras*. The inscription of the Pratiharas trace their origin to *Lakshmana*, the Anuja of Rama, who acted as Rama's door keeper or the Pratiharas. But in fact, when *Danti*-*Durga*, the Rashtrakuta king defeated the Gurjara king *Nagabhata* -*I*, the latter was made a Pratihara while Dantidurga performed the *Hiranyagarbha Dana ceremony at Ujjain*.
