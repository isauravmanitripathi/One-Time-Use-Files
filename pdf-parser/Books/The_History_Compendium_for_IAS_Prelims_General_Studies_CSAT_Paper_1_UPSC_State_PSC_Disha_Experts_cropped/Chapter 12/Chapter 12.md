# Introduction

Delhi Sultanate was founded by Turkish '*Mamluks*' employed by rulers of Afghanistan. Early rulers had to defend north from attempted *Mongol invasions*. Their power derived from military, highways, trade routes and the ability to control provincial governors. They introduced *copper and silver coins*. In their reign, many refugees arrived from Persia after the Mongol invasions bringing many skills. Delhi was the capital of the Delhi Sultanate in the beginning of the thirteen century.

**Slave Dynasty Timeline**

| Ruler                  | Reign       |  |  |  |
|------------------------|-------------|--|--|--|
| Qutbu-ud-din-Aibak     | (1192–1210) |  |  |  |
| Aram Shah              | (1210–1211) |  |  |  |

| Nasiruddin Mahmud      | (1246–1266) |  |  |  |
| Ghiyasuddin Balban     | (1266–1286) |  |  |  |

### **Qutub-ud-din Aibak**

He was born of Turkish parents in Turkiestan. *Aibak* received the title of *Sultan of Delhi* from *Ghiyas-ud-din Mahmud*, the successor of *Muhammad of Ghur*. He built two famous mosques, *Quwwat-ud-Islam and Adhai Din ka Jhonpara* at Delhi and Ajmer. He believed in matrimonial alliances. He was an efficient and brave commander. When he became the Governor of India, he conquered Meerut, Kalinjar, Mahoba, Koel, Ranthambhore, Kannauj etc. He was entitled as *Lakhbaksh* or '*giver of lakhs*'. He started the construction of *Qutub Minar in Delhi*. He died as a result of fall from his horse while playing polo.

### **Aram Shah**

After *Aibak's* death his son *Aram Shah* was enthroned at Lahore. But the nobles of his court decided to enthrone Aibak's son-in-law *Iltutmish* and after the conflict between both of them, *Iltutmish* conquered and became the successor of *Aibak*.

### **Iltutmish**

The full name of Iltutmish was *Shams-ud-din Iltutmish*. He made himself secure as the sultan. He consolidated the Ghurid acquisition in India and proved it with a compact monarch. He completed the unfinished construction of Qutub Minar. He conquered Kannauj, Varanasi, Bahraich, Oudh, Gwalior, Bayana, Ajmer, Sambhal, Nagore etc. He was the first Turk Sultan to strike pure Arabian coins.

His governing class consisted of two groups. Turkish slave officers and Tazik. He organised the iqtas, army, currency to consolidate his sultanate. He reorganised the army of the sultanate and introduced the silver tanka and the copper jital. He also organised the team of 40 loyal nobles, *Turkhan*-*i*-*Chahalgani* to keep a watch over intriguers

### **Razia Sultana**

Iltutmish was succeeded by his daughter *Razia* but the nobles of his court disregarded his wishes and placed his son, *Ruknud*-*din Firoz shah* on the throne but he was not an efficient ruler. So Razia held the title of sultan. The intrigues of the Turkish chiefs called the forty or chahalgani increased against the monarchy. Razia was the only woman who ever sat on the throne of Delhi. She was murdered in 1240 A.D. near *Kaithal*.

### **Ghiyas-ud-din Balban**

*Balban* who had all control over sovereignty sat on the throne of Delhi in 1266 A.D. and adopted the name of *Ghiyasuddin Balban*. For the defence from Mongols, Balban recognized the military department known as *Diwan-i-Ariz*. He introduced Pabos, touching the kings feet and sijda - bowing to the king in his court. He was the first ruler who believed in kingship. *Feroz Khilji* killed the successors of Balban and captured the Delhi sultanate.

#### **Turkan-i-Chahalgani**

The most important institution that developed under the slave Dynasty was the institution of Turkan - i - Chahalgani. It was also called *Chahalgan or* "*the forty*" Chahalgans were a group of highly placed and powerful officers, whom *Iltutmish* had organised as his personal supporters. However, during the days of civil war between the successors of Iltutmish, the Chahalgan started looking for personal gains and played on prince against the other. When Balban assumed charge as Sultan, he crushed their power and strengthened his rule.

Historians say that Tughlaq was the name of neither a race nor a family and that Ghiyasud-din's name was either *Ghazi Tughlaq or Ghazi Beg Tughlaq*. He extended his empire upto Madurai.

His death was followed by a civil war among his descendants. The last ruler of Tughlaq dynasty was Nasiruddin.

#### **The Sultanate after the Tughlaqs**

After the Tughlaqs, *the Sayyid* and the *Lodi Dynasties* continued to rule from Delhi and Agra until 1526 but the control of the Delhi Sultans was only over a small region neighbouring Delhi. Regions like Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwas, Gujrat, Rajasthan and the entire South India had independent rulers.

### **THE SAYYID DYNASTY (1414 A.D. - 1451 A.D.)**

Sayyid dynasty was short lived and was limited to Delhi. *Khizr Khan* was a Sayyid and his dynasty is called the Sayyid dynasty. The last ruler *Alauddin Shah* transfered the kingdom to *Bahlol Lodi*.

## **THE LODI DYNASTY (1451 A.D. -1526 A.D.)**

| Sikander Lodi | 1489–1517 |  |  |  |
| Ibrahim Lodi  | 1517–1526 |  |  |  |

*Bahlol Lodi* was the founder of *Lodi dynasty*. The most important Lodi Sultan was **Sikandar Lodi** who controlled the Ganga Valley. He shifted his capital from *Delhi to Agra***.** He conquered Bihar and Tirhut. He was a bigot and demolished many Hindu temples. He introduced the measurement of land known as '*Gaz*'. The eldest son of Sikandar Lodi was *Ibrahim Lodi* who ascended his throne. His relation with his nobles were not coordial. Ibrahim Lodi was defeated by *Babur* in the first *Battle of Panipat* in 1526 A.D. Thus the reign of Delhi Sultanate ended for 320 years.

#### **Causes of the decline of the Delhi Sultanate**

- (i) Weak system of government.
- (ii) The invasion of Taimur.
- (iii) Lack of clear cut succession policy.
- (iv) Ibrahim Lodi was a foolish emperor.
- (v) Greed for wealth and luxury among nobles.

## **ADMINISTRATION OF THE SULTANATE**

The *iqtadari* was a type of land distribution and administration evolved during the Sultanate period. The *muqtis* had the right to collect and appropriate taxes. The sultan from Iltutmish started the practice of transferring muqtis from one iqta to another.

The sultans were the head of the state. He considered himself the deputy of the khalifa. He was the chief law giver and the Commander-in-chief. Other important officials were *Barid-i-mumalik*, *Wakil-i-dar*, *Amir-i-hazib*, *Sadr-i-Jahan*, *Amir*-*i*-*dad*, *Amir*-*i*-*akhur*, *Shahna*-*i*-*pil*, *Shiqdar*, *Amur*-*i*-*Majlis*, *Majlis*-*i*-*an*. Each province was divided into a number of *shiqs* which were headed by *shiqdars* who maintained law and order. The village was the smallest unit of administration.

#### **Law and Order**

The head of the judicial department was the chief qazi who was responsible for the enforcement of Islamic law. According to Islam, the sources of justice are four-Quran, Hadis, Ijma and Qayas. Ijma was the collection of laws which were obtained from the Mujatahid. There were four types of courts at the provincial level.

- (i) *The court of Governor* (ii) *Qazi-e-Suba's court*
- (iii) *Court of Diwan-i-Suba* (iv) *Court of Sadar-i-suba*

#### **Agriculture and Land Revenue System**

During the regime of Mohammad-bin-Tughlaq and Firoz Tughlaq, there was a marked development of gardens. These gardens led to the improvement of fruits, especially grapes for the preparation of wine. Canals was set up by Firoz. Items of import were horses, armoury, slaves, dry fruits etc. Iron, arms, cotton, grains, sugar, spices, herbs, fruits and indigo were exported.

There were five types of taxes.

| (i)  | Ushra | (ii) | Kharaj | (iii) Khams |
|------|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| (iv) | Jazia | (v)  | Zakat  |             |

Ushra was the land tax taken from non-muslims on the total production from 5% to 10%. Khams was 1/5 of the total property. Zakat was 2.5% religious tax of the total income. Jazia was levied on non-muslims.

*Batai* was a method of fixing the land tax. It was of three types-*Khet Batai, Lank Batai, Ras Batai*.

#### **Music**

*Rabab* and *Sarangi* were introduced by the Turks. *Amir Khusro*  is credited for introducing *Qawali*. The Indian classical work of *Rag Darpan* was translated into Persian.

### **POST-SULTANATE PERIOD**

After the decline of Sultanate, many other kingdoms arose. Music was patronised, regional languages were stimulated and provincial style of architecture developed. Gujarat, Malwa and Rajasthan came into power. The Muslim rulers became friendly with the Rajputs. Gujarat style of architecture was extraordinary. Tomb of Shaikh Farid, Tanka mosque, Jama Mosque of Khambhat, Mosque of Muhafiz Khan, Sidi Saiyyad were built in early 16th century. Bengal, Kashmir, Mewar, Bahmani state's rulers were the patrons of art, science and education.
