### **Maguni Charan Behera**

**Abstract** Interdisciplinary trend in contemporary academics has brought in expanding scope of conventional disciplines beyond their core area. The emerging phase is characterized by discipline's critical engagement with new subject areas or topics covered in other disciplines by employing suitable methodologies drawing from crossdisciplinary sources. Consequently, comprehensive insight develops in understanding the phenomena of investigation in the discipline. Alternatively, when two or more disciplines engage in a particular field of knowledge, a distinct branch or discipline like ethno-history, ethno-linguistics, environmental studies, development studies, social work etc. emerges. Under the backdrop of the above theoretical position, the growth of tribal studies as a distinct branch of knowledge and the possibility of presenting it as a discipline, in view of the fact that several disciplines take interest in the study of diverse tribal issues, is explored in this chapter with reference to expanding frontiers of perspectives in the disciplines of history, archaeology and anthropology.

**Keywords** Tribal histography · Ethnographic studies · Living cultures · Interactive perspectives · Historical approach · Material culture · Synchronic and diachronic studies · Horizontal borrowings · Pre-literate people/community

Study of tribes within the perspective approach of history, archaeology or culture gives us their disciplinary scope of enquiries. It is well known that in academic engagement, disciplinary approach at the core of enquiry in subjects of history, political science, economics, archaeology and the like is invariably specialized in nature. Such an approach reduces understanding of tribal lifeways to disciplinespecific rendering. In contrast, the study of culture employs interdisciplinary approaches of enquiry; unsurprisingly therefore cultural studies have emerged as an

interdisciplinary field of enquiry (see Story 1996; Bennet et al. 2005)1 ; the study within the frame of cultural perspective as adopted in sociocultural anthropology presents tribal life in a totality; all aspects of life are viewed as an integrated whole within the community space and in a synchronic frame of analysis. In other words, cultural perspective defines the scope of enquiry with community as the universe (see Eades 1987: 35–37).

However comparative method used in anthropological studies expands the scope of enquiry to two or more contemporary communities, but the basic unit of comparison essentially remains glued to the community and the basis of investigation to the holistic perspective. In such an approach however, the process of interaction between cultures or evolution of a culture over time conspicuously remains outside the scope of the cultural frame of analysis (cf. Radcliffe-Brown who popularized both synchronic and diachronic study of cultures in 1931). Even the past of the culture is described with reference to cultural elements like myths, legends, tales and songs that exist in contemporary collective memory. It is not unlikely to note inconsistency and ambiguity in the sequence of events and dramatic entry of characters in the folklores narrated at a contemporary period (see Showren's discussion in this volume).

In synchronic tradition, culture change between two periods or places is compared; contributing factors are identified and enumerated, but the process of change is not examined. The question, for example, of how to fill up any missing gap that arises in narratives remains unanswered, and the reply such as 'this is the way things exited/happened' becomes very common. In other words, the culture has its own logic and distinctiveness of expression, explanation and presentation of lifeways in a community.

The culture, particularly the account of its material past, is available through hard archaeological evidence. Except in the case of 'living cultures', archaeology has limitations to ascribe the tradition of past material culture to a particular tribal community; for material cultures of a period and in similar ecological conditions assume cross-community characteristics. In early periods, communities were nomadic or semi-nomadic depending on the extent of dependence in settled agriculture and population size. Moreover, they often shifted their settlements due to population growth, epidemics and in search of suitable land. A number of tribes emerging from a single tribe in course of time and living in favourable ecological settings are likely to display similar material culture traits in the process of vertical borrowings (see Blackburn 2007). On the other hand, similar and identical material culture traits among tribes do not necessarily mean their common origin,2 and archaeology does

<sup>1</sup> It is difficult to define cultural studies and discern the nature of approach. However, Sparks' remark is useful to appreciate interdisciplinary nature of cultural studies. He remarks, 'It is extremely difficult to define "Cultural Studies" with any degree of precision. It is not possible to draw a sharp line and say that on one side of it we can find the proper province of cultural studies. Neither is it possible to point to a unified theory or methodology which is characteristic to it or of it. A veritable rag-bag of ideas, methods and concerns from literary criticism, sociology, history, media studies, etc., are lumped together under the convenient label of cultural studies' (Sparks 2005: 14).

<sup>2</sup>The bamboo culture of the Adis of Arunachal Pradesh and the Khasis of Meghalaya resembles to a great extent. But linguistically they are different, thereby denying their common origin. The Adis belong to Tibeto-Burman family while the Khasis to Mon-Khmer family of languages.

not have any clue to establish common origin even if some tribes might have it. Similarity in house structure (bamboo and wooden made houses on raised platforms among many tribes also of other communities) in Southeast Asian countries could be explained in terms of ecological factors rather than the theory of common origin. This can be also said for shifting cultivation spread in various continents. Archaeological evidences of shifting cultivation in a region cannot link objectively its continuity with contemporary people settled there without comparing the antecedents and historical anecdote of migration of the present and past people of the place. The crucial point which comes forth is inadequacy in a discipline to explicate all aspects of life of people as a single community and as one among different communities over time and space. Historical approach,3 though archaeology is one of its crucial methods, folklore studies (see Blackburn 2007), genealogical studies (see Haley 1973), linguistic studies,4 etc. would be rather more useful complementary methods to trace common origin of different tribal communities.

Archaeology by itself has limitations as a complete approach to study contemporary culture of a community with reference to a material evidence of the past. Different unrelated communities showing similar or identical material culture traits at present might have passed through different stages of evolution at different periods before arriving at the present stage. Even communities of the same stock might have evolved different traits while adapting to changing ecological conditions in course of migration in different groups. Irrigation system of the Apatani of Arunachal Pradesh could be a point to reckon with (Behera 2019) for the system differs from other tribes like the Galo, Adi, Nyishi, etc. who claim common origin and show language affinity but live in hills and plains unlike the valley ecology of the Apatani. On the other hand, despite hailing from two different stocks and language groups, the Khampti of Chowkham and the Apatani of Ziro have adopted largely to a similar method of embankment of channels for irrigation suitable to slope of fields.

Contemporaneity5 as conceptualized in a cultural tradition largely owes to 'horizontal borrowings' over a period of time through interaction process in the sense it is used in Blackburn (2007). The Ahoms and the Khamptis of Shan origin and of one language family, but migrated to the then Assam at different periods of time, follow Hinduism and Buddhism, respectively. These religions greatly influence their cultures at present. Difference in contemporary cultures of these groups has a root in historical process, and arguably historical approach to understand the present dynamics would be useful to study their cultures over time and space.6

History as an independent method of enquiry also suffers from the risk of excluding non-literate people from its scope of study. Such a risk of reductionism is evident in all specialized studies committed to the confinement of respective disciplinary boundaries. Even the claim of holistic approach in sociocultural anthropology to

<sup>3</sup>The history of migration can be useful to trace common origin of dispersed tribes.

<sup>6</sup>Radcliffe-Brown and other functionalists were aware of this fact. Radcliffe-Brown, for example, has discussed historical process in his book *The Andaman Islanders* (1933).

study the culture of people, particularly the tribes, is not free from the influence of reductionist tendency in its scope. Cultural perspective in sociocultural anthropology, as we have mentioned earlier citing Eades (1987: 35–37), is community specific, and it rejects other perspectives adopted by different social science subjects for objective investigation of a number of emerging social phenomena beyond community boundary. It is not a surprise that phenomena like Maoism, extremism and migration have remained outside the core of anthropological investigation. Cultural perspective also is a problematic; for example, to examine the scientific principles embodied in technological knowledge of tribes, it simply describes as it exists. Moreover, analysis of temporal dynamics remains largely absent in historical approaches; it is also evident in the works of Boas.7 Similarly, phenomena like migration and terrorism largely remain outside the core area of analysis in sociocultural anthropology.

The above discussion makes us aware of the inadequacy of a discipline but creates interest in complementing role of disciplines for a comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon over time and space. No doubt, the significance of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches has been increasingly recognized in contemporary academics. Not surprisingly, interdisciplinary branches of knowledge are on the rise. Even investigations on contemporary topics within a discipline often embark upon interdisciplinary approaches. Most of the current topics are better perceived and explained within interdisciplinary frame of analysis. It is increasingly evident in recent years that researches in tribal studies are emerging as interdisciplinary engagements across disciplines. It is not a surprise to note growing interdisciplinary studies on tribes and tribal life such as ethnomedicine, ethnohistory, ethnolinguistics, ethnobotany, tribal literature and so on in contemporary academics.

In view of this, the present volume as a whole is primarily designed to examine interdisciplinary nature of investigations in tribal studies by drawing papers from the disciplines of history, archaeology and sociocultural anthropology. Besides, it is also attempted to examine the extent of interdisciplinary focus in individual papers and to make the case for integration of suitable methods of three disciplines – history, archaeology and ethnography – in order that tribal issues are investigated and appreciated comprehensively. In this regard, it is assumed that comprehensive understanding would not be objectively attained within rigid and stylized frame of a discipline. However, the papers have their own thematic perspectives each; the most crucial one is the attempt to situate tribes not as 'others' but as participants, in different degrees, in the progress of human civilization at regional and national level.

The volume includes 17 papers organized into 3 parts titled as Tribes in History, Ethno-dimension of Archaeology and Historicity in Cultural Understanding. The first part contains six papers in which methods of historical studies are apparently

<sup>7</sup>See Thomas (1989). Nicholas Thomas has argued that the approach of investigation adopted by Boas was concerned with particularity rather than historical or current social change (Thomas 1989: 18). Compare it with Guha (1987: x) who argues that Franz Boas was not ignorant about historicity while studying cultures.

crucial. The other two parts contain five papers each, and the respective papers largely focus on interdisciplinarity of archaeology and culture at the core of investigation. Precisely, the papers included in this volume indicate the shift in stylized approaches to tribal studies and add to the trend of emerging frontiers of knowledge in cross-disciplinary perspectives.

Needless to say, individual contributors in the volume despite their respective training in history, archaeology and sociocultural anthropology have rather investigated tribal life within cross-disciplinary perspectives or critiqued conventional methods of studying tribes. It will not be out of context to mention that a few papers which have focused on one or other aspects of culture are in fact drawn on historical materials; even contemporary identity issue is looked through historical prism.

## **Tribes in History**

At conceptual level of categorizing people as tribes, it was claimed that these people do not have a history, and if at all they have, its sense is shallow (see Lowie 1917; Dube 1977). A question arises with regard to the proposition that tribes do not have a history: Did the tribe appear at the time when colonial/western people encountered them? Certainly, the answer is in negative. These communities existed since long past. It was rather the colonial people who encountered them for the first time and because of their ignorance about these people and their west-centric approaches and perspectives to study history; they could not delve into the history of these people whom they labelled as tribes, aborigines, etc. Because of their ignorance of the history of tribal people, they narrowed down the scope of history of humanity and chained it within the confinement of so-called scientific approach. Not only that, they rejected oral sources as unscientific and did not think it wise to work on an alternative approach with orality as source material to construct the history of these preliterate people. In doing so, they ignored the role of tribal past in the making of human history.

The part Tribes in History is organized by including papers with two objectives. The first one is to dispel the notion predominant in earlier ethnographic studies that tribes did not have a history, particularly before colonial period. Second, the part also presents changing perspective within the discipline of history, thereby expanding its scope to study the history of non-literate people. Precisely, the part attempts to situate tribes in the pages of history and through methodological shift in the discipline of history itself.

Earlier ethnographies are mostly distinguished by their deliberate attempts to keep safe distance from the topic of tribal history on various counts.8 Ethnographers'

<sup>8</sup> In *Antiquity* section, unit-1, namely, 'Ancient History and its Scope', Burckhardt's (1958) remark may be considered the representative view of the time about historicity of non-literate people. 'As regards the scope of our subject, this may be observed: Only the civilized nations, not the primitive ones, are part of history in a higher sense… Primitive peoples, however, interest us only when civi-

perception of studying 'others' cultures' was not based on a methodological frame suitable to incorporate the topic of tribal histography. The studies primarily adopted synchronic perspective (though Radcliffe-Brown has used diachronic study of cultures in 1931; see Radcliffe-Brown (1958)), and oral lore as a source was ignored with the logic of their not conforming to the scientific standard of informed sources required in history writing. It is not a surprise to find scholars like Robert H. Lowie (1917) questioning oral lore as a source of written history.9 With arrogance of the notion of civilization and so-called rationalistic logic, the colonial scholars did not find any reason to recognize the 'sense of history' of preliterate colonized people, particularly of tribes. It is instructive to note Lowie's position on tribal people's sense of history and his logic of rejection to oral traditions as sources of history. He asserts:

I deny utterly that primitive man is endowed with historical sense or perspective: the picture he is able to give of events is like the picture of the European war as it is mirrored in the mind of an illiterate peasant reduced solely to his direct observation. (Lowie 1917: 164)

He attributes this shortcoming to general human tendency 'to mingle fancy with fact, to introduce rationalistic after-thoughts, to ignore the essential and apotheosize the trivial' (Lowie 1917: 167) which exists forcefully among the tribes.

Anthropologists' discomfort about the use of historicity approach in ethnography10 however does not absolutely deny the presence of historical elements in tribal folklores. Almost during the same period, along with Lowie, France Boas has admitted to the fact that 'his want of enthusiasm for the historical method was due rather less to objections on epistemological grounds than to the inadequacy of evidence, and that in any case he too had used history for his anthropological studies' (Guha 1987: x).

A deeper insight into the engagement of historians and anthropologists would bring to the surface that both anthropologists and historians operate within 'adjacent fields of knowledge' (Guha 1987: viii), but they did so in isolation during early years of anthropological investigation. The sense of history remained neglected in anthropology, and oral tradition as a source of information suffered negligence in history quite for a long time till the emergence of such branches of knowledge as anthropological history and ethnohistory in both subjects. The emergence was facilitated by epistemological shifts consequent upon such methodological innova-

<sup>9</sup>Nicholas Thomas' (1989) argument is instructive to understand historian's viewpoint on the convergence between historical and anthropological perspectives. He argues that *historical* **perspective** cannot simply be added to conventional *anthropology*, which systematically takes ethnography 'out of time'. Also see Evans-Pritchard (1961) and Clifford and Marcus (1986) for a critical understanding of the relation between anthropology and history.

<sup>10</sup>See the position of Evans-Pritchard in this regard and Malinowski's reflection on his failure to include historicity in the study of Trobriand culture as discussed in Schapera (1962: 143–144).

tions as 'oral history traditions' and 'memory studies'.11 The innovations (see Ritchie (2003) and Leavy (2011) for theoretical and methodological insights) marked a crucial point of fundamental difference in conventional perspectives of history and anthropology. Histography in tribal studies and oral traditions as potential source got academic recognition, though the branch of knowledge is yet to standardize its multidisciplinary sources of methodology.

Despite the notion that the tribes and other preliterate people do not have a sense of history, and oral traditions lack objective evidence support, a few anthropologists focused on historical substance consciously in synchronic tradition of study. They recognized that very often understanding informed by focusing on a point of time contains a certain sense of the past, sensitivity outside the time. Such a sense was acknowledged by American anthropologists, primarily in the ideas and work of A.L. Kroeber during a period marked by synchronic tradition of studying smallscale communities on a short time period; the historicity approach became crucial (see Guha 1987: ix–x) in studying preliterate communities.

This trend is quite evident in F.G. Bailey's (1958) work and also in other works on village studies. These works, as Guha (1987: ix) has rightly put, are 'in the direction of a pure positivity standing outside time'. Chicago anthropologists and followers of their model of studying villages12 conducted field work to study contemporary Indian villages, but their understanding of the present is informed with a sense of the past.

A distinct convergence of history and anthropology is noticed in the works of Cohn (1981), Davis (1981), Sahlins (1985), Thomas (1963), Wolf (1982) and many others. Use of historical texts is available in anthropological works of Evans-Pritchard (1940) (quoted in Clifford 1990: 55, fn. 4), Redfield (1953) and others. Ethnographic topics have been adopted by social and cultural historians (see Rosaldo 1986). The convergence of history and anthropology continues but with the trend of increasing consciousness to systematize interdisciplinary methodologies. Of the methods facilitating convergence, *memory studies* (see Bosch 2016; Keightley and Pickering 2013; Keightley 2010; Roediger and Wertsch 2008; Kansteiner 2002; Halbwachs 1980) and *oral history tradition* (Carlyle 1841/2013; Ranjan 2012; Thomson 1994; Ballard 1970; Tikekar 1964; Smith 1964; Gooch 1961; Barnes

Trigger in his work of 2003 uses an integrated theoretical approach covering history, archaeology and culture to look at the meaning of similarities and differences in the formation of complex societies in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, Yoruba of Africa, Shang of China, Aztecs and Classic Maya of Mesoamerica and Inka of the Andes. In another work of 1978, he has discussed theoretical issues with regard to understanding of prehistory as an integral aspect of scientific investigation of human behaviour.

<sup>12</sup>Mention may be made of the edited volumes of M.N. Srinivas (1955) and McKim Marriott (1955). M.N. Srinivas's edited volume under the title of *India's Village* has included 16 papers from 13 contributors with no less authority on the subject than Alan R. Beals, M.N. Srinivas, E. Kathleen Gough, F.G. Bailey, McKim Marriot, Marian W. Smith, Jyotirmoyee Sarma, Colin Rosser, G. Morris Carstairs, Eric J. Miller, W.H. Newell, David G. Mandelbum and S.C. Dube. Mc Kim Marriott's edited volume, which is entitled *Village India*, includes contributions from Alan R. Beals, Bernard S. Cohn, M.N. Srinivas, E. Kathleen Gough, Gitel P. Steed, Oscar Lewis, McKim Marriot and David G. Mandelbum. S.C. Dube's (1955) monograph entitled *Indian Village* also reveals a sense of history, more explicitly in The Changing Scene chapter.

1963; Burckhardt 1958; Rowse 1946) are crucial on epistemological grounds. The convergence reflects the growth of oral history and ethnohistory disciplines. In fact historians who use memory studies to reconstruct oral history largely draw on *Social Frameworks of Memory*, the famous work of French sociologist Maurice Halbwachs (see Olick and Robbins 1998; also see Halbwachs 1980) written in 1925.

It is not out of context to mention that the relation between history and anthropology, archaeology and ethnography or culture and history travelled from the stage of independent existence of each discipline to convergence though gradual, but unconsciousness drifts to each other's field initially and conscious engagement subsequently.

Recognition to oral sources ignored earlier due its subjectivity resulted from questioning the objectivity in conventional history discipline by modern historians. The highly claimed objectivity did not stand empirical test on many occasions. Cronon (1992: 12) maintains that the 'same event' may be portrayed quite differently depending on author and perspective, even when the same sources are used. Wertsch (2002: 12) informs us that the overall narratives of the Second World War as taught in school and as ingrained in the collective memory of the people often stand in stark opposition to one another (cf. Chang 1997). When this is the stand of objectivity in literate societies, its absence is quite obvious in non-literate societies like the tribes. The historicity of these people therefore must find its root in their own perspectives, but not what traditional historians would like to present.

Recognition to people's perspectives however should not compromise with systematic enquiries and well-defined frame of analysis, and must not consider history, folklore and culture as one stock. Oral history and memory studies methods are crucial in this regard. Memory studies methods lead to the foundation of oral history. However, use of memory is not unqualified. Oral history per se uses individual memory if the individual was the witness of the event or heard from one who was present during occurrence of the phenomenon (see Bernstein et al. 2008). This also holds for collective memory. However, collective memory extends to remembering a past occurrence beyond direct eyewitness criterion. In this regard Q. Wang's observation is instructive. Wang (2008: 307) informs, 'Throughout history collective memory has been central to the creation of community, from a small unit such as a family to an entire nation. The social practices of collective remembering allow the members of a community to preserve a conception of their past'. In tribal societies collective memory is preserved in the process of oral transmission which is informal but institutionalized as a cultural practice.

Two implications are in order. The first one is with regard to the use of oral source that is likely to limit interviewee or interviewee's informed knowledge from a direct participant or eyewitness. The second is regarding removal of direct participation condition and recognizing collective memory of the group. In the second sense, historical sources go beyond the standard use of oral tradition and include folklore, enduring customs, language and place names (see Axtell 1979).13

<sup>13</sup>To Axtell, 'ethnohistory is essentially the use of historical and ethnological methods and materials to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in a culture defined by ethnological concepts and categories' (Axtell 1979: 2).

The extended oral tradition is the fabric of which ethnohistory is made. It studies historicity of indigenous people, also called tribes, by examining standard historical sources along with oral tradition of cultures and customs; in short it uses both historical and ethnographic data, and in this sense it is distinguished from oral history that emphasizes on standard historical sources.

In ethnohistory, a change in perspective of conventional history and corresponding sources is a fundamental area of distinction. Accompanied with it is also the change in the perspective of understanding the present through the past which is a problematized boundary of relations between memory studies and histography. Halbwachs' solution is enlightening. To Halbwachs history is 'a dead memory, a way of preserving pasts to which we no longer have an "organic" experiential relation' and that 'this understanding of the distinction negates the self-image of historiography as the more important or appropriate attitude towards the past: History's epistemological claim is devalued in favour of memory's meaningfulness' (quoted in Olick and Robbins 1998: 110).

In addition to methodological innovations, the interaction of tribes with historical forces right from colonial contact claims for an appropriate treatment of the history of tribes. The contemporary tribal situation has evolved in historical process contrary to the notion of tribal isolation and presents material sources which the discipline of history considers 'scientific'. Needless to say, the domain of unrecorded traditions shares the records of written 'civilization' in course of interaction, and people of every successive period leave recorded past behind. As we learn from epics and chronicles maintained by kings, tribes in India had contact with written civilization, even before colonial period (see for details Vidyarthi and Rai 1985: 25–35).

It is also increasingly recognized that historical approach to study tribal situation holds key to the understanding of emerging tribal issues. In order to understand objectively the indigenous claim of tribes in India, André Béteille (1998) has recommended historical approach for a scrutiny of the claim, for it is the study of historical antecedents, but not a cultural perspective that would establish the question of who are original settlers in course of migration. Historical approach is evident in the works of Redfield (1953), Geertz (1973), Sumit Guha (1999), Bernard Cohn (1961, 1962, 1980, 1981) and many others in understanding culture dynamics.

Historical approach to study tribes reveals the process of change consequent upon either internal and/or external dynamics. External dynamics are the results of a tribe's outside interaction. Papers included in this part largely focus on any one of the themes: process of interaction of tribes or the need for ethnohistorical approach to tribal studies. In short, tribal history is approached either methodologically or empirically or by a combination of the both.

A study of tribes beyond the community frame (anthropologists study tribes as community) situates them in interactive mode over time and space. In other words, the tribe is investigated not in isolation but by situating it in relation to others, both tribes and non-tribes. Empirical studies, even if within community model, do not deny a tribe's interaction beyond its community boundary, and this is evident in anthropological studies within *change and continuity* framework. Moreover, tribes studied over time and space dispels the stereotype that they are 'isolated' groups. In view of this, intra-tribal cultural differences can be explained in terms of tribe's projection at different levels of interaction.

It goes without saying that interactive perspective of tribal studies is a right approach as tribes do not exist in isolation. Studies over time are essentially historical enquiries, and studies over space however could be cross-cultural comparisons at a point of time. But tribal studies over space also could be investigations of relational dynamics on a time scale across tribal and nontribal spheres of interaction. It leads to the fundamental point of temporal and spatial convergence across the tribes influenced by the extent and the span of time each tribe got in the process of interaction. This difference could be the crucial point of difference among tribes. In this sense studies over space entail historical enquiries. This perspective approach is quite evident in the study of Bhils by *Nandini Sinha Kapur* in her paper entitled *The Bhils in the Historic Setting of Western India.* The study delineates the space of Bhils' interaction with regional state powers and rural society of Mewar and Dungarpur in southern Rajasthan and in Ahmadabad locality and the Panchmahals in Gujarat in medieval times – between the seventh and the fifteenth centuries to be precise. Though apparently a historical study, the paper is essentially an interdisciplinary enquiry as it has explained the process of acculturation through *Kshyatriyaization* or *Rajputaization* and *peasantization* in a historical perspective. Moreover, the paper draws on various sources like literary texts and bardic traditions in addition to historical evidences.

When tribes are studied in a historical setting within an interdisciplinary perspective, the thematic scope of investigation in a paper expands to address a number of issues. This is also evident in Sinha Kapur's paper in which she has challenged many stereotypes, raised issues for further investigation and attempted explanations to many queries. The study challenges universality of genealogical origin of a tribe with Koli of Gujarat as case to the point and thus places tribal formation in sociopolitical-ecological settings. It disproves not only the notion of 'tribes as isolated groups' but also rejects the stereotypes that tribes exist outside the state formation. In contrast, it places tribes in a process of interaction with states and neighbouring societies. It further informs us about elite formation and status differentiation among the tribes due to varied nature of integration into the regional political economies.

The paper also points out perspective gaps that arise when different approaches are employed to study tribal phenomena. It is evident when occupationally differentiated Bhils – peasants, labourers, miners, watchmen, royal employment as forest guards, guide, etc. along with the occupation of dealing in charcoal and forest products – are investigated within the frame of embeddedness, meaning 'the economy is only a part of the social set up'. In other words, economic interaction outside the boundary of the culture/social set-up is ignored in a study within culturally embedded frame.

Significantly, Sinha Kapur's paper has directed our attention to an understanding of the process of *Kshyatriyaization* of the Bhils and their social mobilization. Political alliances and military allies stand out as crucial factors in this process. Political relations, however, were never always cordial; there were instances of confrontations as well.

Tribal confrontation with regional state power provides the clue to understand present tribal situation. It is well recognized that tribes in contemporary India constitute marginalized section of the population and hence fall within the bracket of subalterns who cannot speak (Spivak 1988/2003). But it is evident in Sinha Kapur's paper that Bhils during medieval times were not subalterns of state power; rather they were allies of regional rulers. They had entered into various alliances, even to the extent of 'ritual alliance' at the time of coronation of the Ranas of Mewar, and had occasions of resisting state power. It is evident from the information that Chaulukian state was not very successful in mobilizing agricultural revenues from Bhil settlements. It speaks of Bhil's autonomy. In other words, during that time they could speak and over the years they have been reduced to the rank of subalterns with the tag can they speak? Sinha Kapur is aware of this 'shifting status' when she observes the gap that exists 'in our understanding of the distinction between the Bhils of the present day and those of the early medieval and medieval periods'.

A reference to methodological question is due. Tribes being preliterate communities, our reliance on conventional sources of writing history is likely to present very insignificant part of their life and extent of inter- and intra-group interactions on a time scale. Needless to say, sources which are integral part of tribal life like oral tradition in combination with conventional sources of history are certain to give deeper insight into reconstruction of tribal history. In this context it is crucial to note that Sinha Kapur's paper does not inform Bhils in the historical setting by drawing on conventional sources of history. She has consulted, as mentioned, literary texts and bardic traditions along with historical information. Essentially, her paper transcends conventional boundaries of history and anthropology but consolidates between the two. The perspective of betwixt and between provides the basis of ethnohistory – the history of preliterate communities. Undoubtedly therefore, ethnohistory is suitable to anthropological tradition of studying community as the unit of enquiry by applying both historical and anthropological sources and methods.

The emerging perspective of a midway discipline between history and anthropology to study preliterate communities of Arunachal Pradesh is evident in *Tana Showren*'s paper entitled *Exploring Ethnohistory of Arunachal Pradesh*. He cautions us against the use of a particular disciplinary approach or source materials while reconstructing the history of preliterate communities. But he himself has heavily relied on oral tradition without triangulation with historical sources. Folklore as an oral tradition travels through different versions even in a community over time and space (see Doye 2018) with narrator's imaginative interpolations or extrapolations to suit to the context (cf. Ingold 2001 for the concept education of attention as an explanatory tool of the above logic). Showren is aware of this dynamics in folklore tradition when he critically examines number of wives of Tani14 and attributes the reason of emergence of different versions to the evolution of different

<sup>14</sup>Tani (Thanyi) groups of tribe believe that Tan had wives from all species – plants, animals and human.

phratries and to less or no contact between different settlements and groups due to physical or other barriers. He maintains that 'traditions might have been gradually corrupted in order to suit the imagination of new branches of lineage or clan. As such many previously held common traditions might have been imperceptibly distorted and more new elements by the narrators or traditional raconteurs added'.

Folklore is used to construct and assert an identity. Identity assertion drawing on myths and legends has become a fashion in our contemporary world (see Sen 2010; Bhattacharjee 2007). With a definite objective in view, an existing folklore is used directly or with modification to justify and give meaning to the purpose envisioned in the attempt to construct an identity. In this context it is to be noted that Haimendorf15(1946/1950: 7) did not find any genealogical and language affinity while he studied the present Puroiks (also known as Sulungs) in 1940s. But in a later work (Deuri 1982: 1), a myth is narrated connecting the origin of the Puroik with the Nyishi community. However, Puroiks have their version of origin (Deuri 1982: 6). But in this paper of Showren, the Puroik community is linked to Tani (Thanyi), the common ancestor of Tani (Thanyi) group of tribes.

The title of Showren's paper would apparently suggest that Arunachalee community and Arunachal Pradesh are conterminous. In Arunachal Pradesh however, Census 2011 records about 25 distinct major tribes and around 100 minor and subtribes. The phrase *Ethnohistory of Arunachal Pradesh* therefore would convey the meaning of covering all the tribal communities under the scope of its investigation, thus attesting to its general applicability to the study of all preliterate communities with focus on individual communities. It is to be noticed that Showren has not investigated any single community; rather he has attempted to construct a greater ethnic identity for a number of communities of the state rallying round the mythological ancestor Tani (Thanyi), though communities and subcommunities like the Bangru and Puroik16 do not share traditionally common ancestry with Thanyi in their origin myth.

Ethnohistorians therefore need to be cautious in the use of myths, legends, etc. as informed source17 while they are engaged in reconstructing history of preliterate communities. Use of folklore source in ethnohistory to construct a greater identity for a number of communities would point to realization of a contemporary exigency, designed or actual or/and imply to re-conceptualization of ethnic community beyond existing consciousness in the sense of a tribe.

Showren has placed the Puroik and the Bangro 'outside social' category of the Tanis (Thanyis) or of the Nyishis (?), though both the communities share their terri-

<sup>15</sup>Haimendorf uses the appellation 'Sulu' and 'Sulung' interchangeably.

<sup>16</sup>That the Puroiks don't have language affinity and cultural similarity can be ascertained from a scrutiny of their cultural life and study of earlier works even though they have a long record of subordinate status in their relations with the Nyishia and Miji tribes (see Haimendorf 1946/1950: 7; Stonor 1972; Behera 2004; Deuri 1982). For Bangru's myth of a separate origin, see Ramaya (2011).

tory and livelihood strategy mostly with the Nyishis in a binary totality of 'the self' and 'the other' (Behera 2018). In such an 'othering process,' 'the other' along with 'the self' defines a binary totality in terms of Tani (Thanyi) groups – 'social' and 'outside social'. How the totality of the perception including both Tanis (Thanyi) and 'outside social' is constructed and how 'outside' constitutes into 'greater Tani (Thanyi) group' are however conceptual problems at this point inviting further investigation. There appear logical contradictions drawing on contemporary narratives without triangulation with available other sources.

All said and done, the point which Showren wants to make is clear. He adds a new interdisciplinary perspective to study tribal past in Arunachal Pradesh which is virtually absent in academic engagement in the state. Showren, an indigenous scholar from Nyishi community and a historian by formal education, at the first instance raises the question of objectivity and impartiality in the study of his own community which is the central point of reference to ethnohistory. In his paper, a departure from formal methodological perspectives to study the history of preliterature communities is rightly articulated within emerging ethnohistory subject. In our contemporary times, humanity is no more reduced to the celebration of the 'dominants' or 'victorious' only by ignoring the 'subordinates' or 'defeated'. The history of humanity is the history of all – the conqueror and the conquest, the ruler and the ruled, the elite and the subaltern, the powerful and the powerless, the rich and the poor, the literate and non-literate and other such binary constructs showing 'superior' and 'inferior' groupings, along with the individual, family, clan, etc.

Obviously ethnohistory perspective of studying preliterate communities is very crucial in the context of Arunachalee communities, and for this heavy reliance on any disciplinary source is likely to question its validity. Showren rather argues for multidisciplinary approaches by combining 'archaeology, history, ethnology, ethnotoponymy, ethnopolity, social and cultural anthropology under one rubric…'.

Another crucial point which is discernible from his paper is that ethnohistory should not confine to the study of preliterate communities in isolation; rather it should evolve as a comprehensive branch of knowledge to include the history of tribes (preliterate communities) in relation to others, both literate and preliterate, in the composite history of the nation.

It is increasingly evident from the papers of Nandini Sinha Kapur and Tana Showren that multidisciplinary perspective to study histography of preliterate communities particularly in India is in currency in contemporary academics. Its growing importance is crucial on two counts – first, the preliterate stage of tribes, and second, the issue of objectivity in colonial writings because of inherent bias and prejudices in them. *Amrendra Kr. Thakur* directs our attention to the second issue in his paper entitled *Historical Reconstruction of the Past of Northeast India: An Assessment of Colonial Writings*. The objectivity of histography on tribes is questioned because of colonial mindset that has shaped the entire discourse of tribal studies. It is also painfully recognized in his paper that Indian historians have fallen prey to colonial approaches in their wirings and thus endorsing colonial views about preliterate people. Objectivity gap is apparent when 'western centric' approach is applied to understand 'non-western' reality. So, Thakur observes that crucial 'sociological features of the tribal societies of northeast India such as well-formed political and economic institutions to administer laws; conduct social and private ceremonies and impose punishments' were found neglected in colonial writings. Moreover the 'historical process that led to the formation, maturity, and ultimate subversion of various socio-economic and politico-judicial institutions in colonial northeast India' is found overlooked in these writings. Further, colonial intention to know the tribes 'within the broader context of the colonial state's search for establishing an order and legitimacy of itself' directed the administrative interest to collect ethnographic accounts than writing history. Ethnographic accounts, though providing firsthand field-based information on the tribes of northeast India, are not usable for the purpose of scientific reconstruction of the past [because of anthropolization of tribes].

It is not a surprise to find sponsored writings by scholars, administrators, historians, etc. on Northeast people. How far these writings would qualify the test of historical authenticity and stand the scrutiny of objectivity is a matter of academic debate.

Thakur has provided a list of important works prepared during colonial period. He has his strong reservation about their usefulness while reconstructing the history of Northeast India. Like Showren, he strongly argues for a multidisciplinary approach, which in fact has been used in academics, by combining ethnography and history together to reconstruct the history of the Northeast India in general and preliterate communities in particular.

Though colonial writings as source materials have been seriously questioned on reconstruction of unbiased history of preliterate communities, still these writings and other source materials of colonial period are crucial evidences for an understanding of pitiable conditions of these communities at present. Papers of Joseph Bara and Dinesh Narayan Verma, drawing on source materials available during colonial period, trace educational backwardness and general poverty of tribes respectively to colonial policies.

*Joseph Bara* in his paper entitled *Schooling 'Truant' Tribes: British Colonial Compulsions and Educational Evolution in Chhotanagpur, 1870–1930* informs us that British colonial education in India, promoted under the policy frame of 'filtration', barely reached the remote recesses of the empire. Permeation was sluggish and growth uneven. He took the case of Mundas and Oraons of Chhotanagpur in the then Bengal province for his enquiry. His paper shows that while parts of Bengal led colonial India in educational growth, places like Chhotanagpur, in stark contrast to centres such as Calcutta, remained largely untouched. This was despite the fact that the system was introduced as early as 1839 as a local project at the behest of the Political Agent in Chhotanagpur. Not only that, the system so introduced also received considerable impetus in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century from the colonial agenda of 'civilizing' the 'barbarians'. The objective of mass education was not realized. Rather it created elite bias, for realtime impact of education remained trapped in the upper strata of society. The government, for implementation of education policy, largely relied upon the services of missionaries. The efforts of the missionaries, their humanitarian attitude towards the tribals notwithstanding, were ineluctably marred by the constraints of their mission field and prejudiced missionary paradigm.

The missionaries adopted the agenda of conversion while they involved in the implementation process of government policy. Moreover there was an intense rivalry among some missionaries. The state on the other hand also had its own interest of creating workforce with minimum English education. As a result, higher level of educational institutions did not figure in the agenda of the state and missionary partnership. In this regard Bara has observed that the education policy 'was heavily dictated by colonial and missionary agendas resulting in stunted structure, with a virtual vacuum in terms of higher education in the tribal areas till the time of Independence'. The missionaries therefore were unable to devise a pro-tribal educational policy, thus leading to the tribals receiving the faulty system on their own terms.

The attitude of nontribals on the other hand was 'highly prejudiced against the tribals, looking down upon them as *mlechchh*'. The mistrust so created did not attract the attention of tribal intelligentsia to the concept of basic education propounded by Gandhi. They tried to valorize certain aspects of the system but remained unsuccessful to further develop the system through indigenous initiatives. In Independent India the colonial legacy remained at the core of education policy. All these factors affected educational achievements of the tribes, and as Bara laments, 'today the tribes of India comprise the largest rejects of Indian education from top to bottom'.

In a similar vein, *Dinesh Narayan Verma*'s paper entitled *Vulnerability of Autochthon Paharias of Santal Parganas: Revealing Continuity of Colonial Legacy* links present marginalized status of the *Paharias* of Santal Praganas to colonial policy of allowing Santal settlement in the former's areas for the expansion of settled agriculture. In the process of Santal settlement, Verma directs our attention to the loss of lands and forests by the Paharias, for, as Verma informs, 'the Santals in large numbers settled as agriculturists with the help of Company's officials and gradually acquired autochthons "lands and forests"'.

Though implicit, failure of present welfare measures introduced for the Paharias indicates a link with colonial legacy. In recent academics marginalization, deprivation, etc. in development process are studied within the frame of 'social exclusion' (see Lenoir 1974; quoted in Sen 2000). It is also evident in such studies that the forces of marginalization, subordination, exploitation, etc. of an earlier period slither into the new system (see Behera and Basar 2009: 241; also see Walton 2007, cited in World Bank 2011: 2). Arguably the Paharias who enjoyed a subordinate/ marginalized status during British administration due to loss of their resources to Santal remained so even in the process of national development (cf. Behera and Basar 2009 to understand the process of exclusion in the process of development intervention). This also explains prevailing scenario of educational backwardness among the tribes as is informed in Bara's paper.

In recent years marginalized communities raise their voices against historical injustice done to them in the past (e.g. see Karlsson 2004: 8). These communities are increasingly aware of their rights, and many of them have started movements of identity assertion through demands for their rights. This trend is also noticed among the Paharias. In this regard, Verma has been sympathetic to the cause of the Paharias who raise their demands for restoring their rights over resources which they had lost during colonial period and which they could not recover or could not be compensated even through state-sponsored welfare measures. Needless to say, as papers of Bara and Verma inform us, the root of present maladies in tribal communities stems from a complex web of their interactions in a historical process.

It goes without saying that historical studies provide better insight not only of a past event but also of factors contributing to its occurrence; the course it takes and consequences those follow. In fact such studies explain, as is evident in the papers of Bara and Verma discussed above, the present through the prism of the past along the dimensions of 'factors' and 'processes'. This way of understanding the contribution of historical studies also lies at the core of investigation in *D.L. Haokip* 's paper entitled *Bible Translation in Kuki-Chin of Indo-Myanmar and Bangladesh: A Historical Analysis.* The paper argues that Bible translations into different Kuki-Chin dialects acted further as a powerful disintegrating agent resulting in the assertion of micro-group identity which had already evolved upon dialectical variations.

In this context it is noteworthy that a group identity as a tribe is often an outside construct though people have their respective terms of cumulative reference.18 To cite an example, the construct Naga is a generic identity which includes Ao, Angami, Sengma and many other independent identities. Further within Ao, as an example, the people have their respective clan and lineage identity. In Arunachal Pradesh people who are known as Adi were known as Abors in Ahom records and colonial writings (see Nyori 1993: 1). Adi as a group identity is a post-independent construct and includes Minyongs, Padams, Passi, Tengams, etc. (Nyori 1993: 4). These groups in addition to their generic Adi identity also have phratry, clan, lineage and even village identity. For example, the Padams have clan identity like Perme, Pertin, Megu, etc. and below it lineage identity (see Behera 2010). In colonial writings, the Padams were recorded as Bor Abors (Nyori 1993: 9), and even the present Galo tribe was included under Abor designation (see Nyori 1993).

The point which I would like to make is that people did not have the need of a greater identity, such as the tribe before they were designated by the one, as their identity reference did not have spatial expansion before coming in contact with nontribals, particularly state powers. Phratry, clan or lineage identity served the purpose of presenting an individual unequivocally in course of their limited spatial interactions.

Studies on tribes inform us that descendants of a common ancestor formed into different tribes by migrating to different places (e.g. Tani (Thanyi) group of tribes in Arunachal Pradesh) or people migrated in different groups to a place where they together formed one tribe (the Siddi of Gujarat or the Khampti of Arunachal

<sup>18</sup>Depending on the situation, an individual introduces himself in terms of his father, lineage, clan, phratry or ancestor. During a field study in 2004 at Damro, it was observed that a Pertin person used to introduce himself as Pultin, Rapul, Tinrang, Paaper and Kepang in different contexts and places. These are forefathers starting from the lineage head to the community head (Kepang) – the person whose descendants are Padams.

Pradesh). In the case of fissiparous tribes,19 it can be said that variations in dialects, dress pattern, social institutions, nature of interaction with ecological conditions, etc. appeared over time and distinguished them as separate tribes. Needless to say, a tribe or a generic tribe was not a homogenous group.20

So is also the case with Kuki-Chin tribes. Haokip is aware of this fact when he maintains that:

their socio-economic and political system might have become a social barrier compounded by the location of their villages-rugged hills, or mountains, ridges strategically good for protecting themselves from enemies but on the other hand isolated them to the outside world, leaving no room for loan words.

However he has not enlightened us about common origin of these diverse Kuki-Chin groups either from an ancestor or place. He drives us to the point that Kuki-Chin people are differentiated groups with micro-variations but have affinity all along, as Haokip would like us to appreciate, 'through common nomenclature; myths of common ancestry, shared historical memories; common cultural heritage; common causes for homeland and common customary practices' to present greater Kuki-Chin identity.

Bible translation into dialects of micro-groups is what, Haokip argues, reinforced already existing identity variations instead of forging a Kuki-Chin identity. To substantiate his claim, he has presented historical data describing the force and process of translations and about emergence of various missionary denominations around individual/family missionaries. It is also increasingly evident from his paper that native scholars hold British policy of conversion, particularly the nature of Bible translation followed by missionaries, and non-interference in customary tribal affairs responsible for perpetuating village, clan or territorial identity evolved in the process of fission. The paper has also made a reference to the mechanism of 'native' involvement in the success of conversion to Christianity in a large scale. The technique in the mechanism was so powerful that traditional elites invited missionaries to adopt Christianity.21

<sup>19</sup>Refers to division of a tribe into different tribes through migration on the basis of social units like clan or lineage.

<sup>20</sup>The Khampti tribe has three social divisions, namely, Phanchau at the top hierarchy, Paklung in the middle and Phan-e-on at the bottom. The Wancho, Tangsa, etc. are socially divided into chief and commoner clans. On the basis of dialectic variation, the Galos are divided into three groups: Lare, Pogo and Niji-Karka. The constituent tribes of the Naga are different on the basis of dialect, settlement and ancestry variations. Even moiety division of a tribe reveals status differentiation.

<sup>21</sup>Also see Vaiphei (2015: 186). He informs that in the case of southern hills, it was not British colonialism that brought Christianity but rather the local natives themselves who wanted to adopt Christianity.

## **Ethno-Dimension of Archaeology**

In the papers included in this volume, though broadly grouped under three distinct disciplines, namely, history, archaeology and culture (ethnography), the perspective approaches in all of them are primarily interdisciplinary. The premise that interdisciplinary approaches provide comprehensive understanding of a phenomenon is verified through these papers.

Interdisciplinary perspective approach expands the frontiers of knowledge by transcending boundaries of specialized disciplines. History as the study of recorded past of humanity places unrecorded past of it in a binary opposite. Archaeological method adopted in history transcends the latter's scope beyond the time divide. The expanded scope in fact builds up the structure of conjectures which are meaningfully proved with informed ethnography. We have seen in the papers under Part I how history is enriched by adopting ethnographic data while reconstructing the past of preliterate communities. Papers in this part direct our attention to the expanded frontier of knowledge in archaeology discipline when it uses informed ethnography for interpretation and analysis. It is not a surprise to note the emergence of ethnohistory (see ManiBabu in this volume) as a distinct branch of knowledge in the discipline of archaeology in our contemporary times.

How crucial is ethnography in interpreting archaeological data is discussed in *Mayanglambam ManiBabu*'s paper entitled *Archaeology through Ethnography: An Academic Treatment with the Study of Human Past.* His paper provides a theoretical perspective and epistemological necessity of employing ethnography to interpret artefacts and its contemporary significance. He informs us that artefacts by themselves make no sense but only acquire significance when archaeologists employ ethnographic information in interpreting archaeological data with the use of analogy while studying past dynamics in living contexts.

Urgency of ethnoarchaeology emerges from the concern of archaeologists in the wake of population growth, economic development, growth of cities and suburbs, development of transformation systems, elite acquisitiveness, etc. which pose enormous threats to the in situ archaeological records throughout the world during the next centuries. Corollary to this problem is the issue that relates to conservation, management and preservation of archaeological record of the past for future generations.

ManiBabu acquaints us with the expansion of myriad theoretical issues emerging from archaeologists' concern with the prehistory of human behaviour through the perspective of living non-industrial and small-scale societies. In this context ethnoarchaeology, as one of the growing subdisciplines, aims at developing better explanatory models of past human culture through engagement with living societies, recording observable behaviour and residues. In fact theoretical paradigm of ethnoarchaeology rests on the construct of ethnographic analogy and the principles of *uniformitarianism* (see Wallace 2011: 101–103),22 with a premise that living 'pre-

<sup>22</sup>See Cameron (1993) for the debate on the use of the principle of uniformitarianism in archaeology.

modern' indigenous people act as proxies for the people in the past and are deemed appropriate to be compared with archaeological contexts and thereby form important sources of interpretative information for the archaeologists.

With this theoretical perspective and the felt need of urgent ethnoarchaeology, ManiBabu identifies Manipur state as the site of urgent ethnoarchaeology because the state is a fertile ground for archaeological studies. His preference for Manipur however shows general concern for urgent ethnoarchaeological studies covering relevant sub-branches of archaeology. The rest four papers on megalithic tradition, rock art and tribal paintings included in this part support to the issues which ManiBabu has identified to be investigated by archaeologists by employing ethnoarchaeological approach.

*Dwipen Bezbaruah* in his paper entitled *Ethnography to Archaeology: Tracing the Past of the Tribes of Assam and Adjoining Areas* strongly argues to combine ethnography to archaelogy for a comprehensive reconstruction of the archaelogical past of preliterate communites. Implicitly his paper emphasizes on linking informed ethnographic data of intangible cultural heritage with tangible cultural heritage as informed archaeological evidences. Such an interdisciplinary perspective, it is argued, forms the core of ethnoarcheology and immensely helps understanding the past present continuum of preliterate tribal communites. Drawing on informed archaeology on such areas as megalithic traditions, shifting cultivation, pottery and culinary practices, he studies how ethnoarchaeological investigaiton unveils the unrecorded past with the help of ethnographic data. Living archaeology, as he argues, is a continuity of the past and links the present with Neololitic stage of evolution of human civilization. He comes to the conclusion by comparing tools and implements used in shifting cultivation in our time with those in Neolitic times.

Archaeological evidences like the megalithic tradition when viewed with ethnographic data throw light on social dynamics and belief of the cult of dead. Bezbaruah, for example, informs that the 'megalithic tradition of the Khasis tells about a closely-knit matrilineal tradition *a living culture* (*emphasis added*). That a prominent position is given to the eldest maternal uncle is reflected in the stone monuments with a taller central memorial stone *mawkni*) erected in his memory, thus reflecting the matrilineal solidarity in the Khasi social organisation'.

It is also evident that ethnography linked with archaeology is useful to delineate cultural zone across countries and regions. He cites Southeast Asia as an example as it displays 'uniformity in structural; socio-cultural and territorial aspects'. Use of tools and implements in shifting cultivation at present, tradition of pottery and culinary practices, as they have been investigated in archaelogical studies of Garo village, links the present with Neolotihic times, though a present tribe with such practices cannot be ascertained objectively as continuity from those times.

It goes without saying that juxtaposition of archaeological and ethnographic contexts transcends the boundaries of historical periodization; as a result of it, the scope of history emerges contiguous in time and space.

*P. Binodini Devi* in her paper entitled *On the Discovery of Megalithic Art in Manipur* has carried forward the ethnoarchaeological investigation among eight Manipuri tribes in the line envisioned in ManiBabu's paper. She has enlisted practices of megalithic tradition prevailing among the tribes that show association with rock arts. For example, she directs our attention to engravings and paintings on the menhirs erected in Mao villages. Interestingly engravings and paintings display inscriptions in their dialects using Roman scripts, which she opines, belong to the historical period after introduction of modern education. Modern tradition is also evident as 'engravings and paintings on rocks are now replaced by huge but carved out wooden planks'.

Megalithic arts recorded by Devi display topical variations, for some:

are associated with memorials and commemoratives; some with head hunting; whereas some are used to measure the height of small lads of a particular village to confirm the affordable height of village cowboy; some are used to measure the height of village youths; particularly the unmarried boys to fix their marriageable height; some are related to fertility; some are related to the religious ground; while few of them are related to different games.

Megaliths and associated rock art practices convey the idea of social structure and religious beliefs of tribes. It is evident when they perform feasts and rituals while erecting menhirs. Though presented in a different context, Poumia practice of erecting alignments of small stones for those brave individuals who had committed sin, menhirs for commemorating feast-of-merit and the practice of carving of buffalo's horn are useful for our understanding. In a descriptive style, she has attempted to merge ethnography with archaeological knowledge in a meaningful way by interpreting megalithic practices with social status of individuals.

In *Seema Mamta Minz*'s paper entitled *Ethnography: An Emerging Trend in Rock Art Research*, ethnography and archaeology have merged in a fruitful collaboration when present people inhabiting the locality of rock art site have adopted the designs of rock art sites to decorate their houses. A similar perspective is evident in *Dibishada B. Garnayak*'s paper which is entitled *Prehistoric art and living traditions: A study of selected Rock Art sites in Odisha*. Both the papers have similar focus but with distinct frames of analysis. In Garnayak's paper ethnography reveals rock art forms, while in Minz's paper ethnography and rock arts have been presented in ethnoarchaeological frame of investigation. The areas like faiths and beliefs and art forms in living traditions have a link with the archaeological period as is evident in Garnayak's paper. But this link is conceptualized in Minz's paper explicitly by merging ethnography in archaeology with a view to understand the dynamics of living culture and its continuity from the past.

Garnayak's paper reveals an important dimension of India's cultural tradition – the process of acculturation by establishing a link of tribe's worldview with epic heroes and events through rock sites. This is reflected in their reverence to rock sites and the practice of decorating their house walls using motifs, for example, broom pattern during festive occasions as seen in Rajbahal Ushakuthi. His paper evidently shows a dimension of Indian civilization of coexistence and the process of Hinduization as tribes believe in Hindu rituals and deities of Hindu pantheon like Vana Durga, Mangala, etc. in rock sites.

Minz has widened the scope of investigation covering both rock arts and tribal paintings. In a way rock art points to the life of people in caves, rock shelters, etc., and also in the form of tribal paintings, these link the contemporary people of a settled village life in human-made shelters. Artistic genius of people has shifted from rock surface to wall and floors of dwelling houses as is also noted in Garnayak's paper, thus signifying the continuity of a past tradition; for the themes and motifs, tools, colour composition and a sense of collective expression show resemblance between rock arts and tribal paintings.

Minz is critical of conventional approach to study rock art. She comments:

traditional methods of archaeology somewhere failed to give rational answers. Rock art is not an art for art sake, but it is an intangible part of human culture. The conventional method of study could not provide tools to unravel it in the context.

She argues that archaeological data and informed ethnography, i.e. the study of 'living cultural practices, rock art and paintings to be specific could be useful in reconstructing the past of early human'. In other words, she also emphasizes on the use of ethnography to interpret rock art and tribal paintings and interrelations between the two within a historical frame of analysis, in particular on a comprehensive method of 'ethnoarchaeological history' to study living cultural practices in preliterate communities. She has supported her argument with examples drawn from Australia and South Africa and thus directed our attention to methodological convergence in studying rock art and tribal paintings to understand the past and present of a preliterate community in the process of cultural evolution.

## **Historicity in Cultural Understanding**

Synchronic tradition of study by its nature presents static features of a society and culture, and even the dynamic elements in it assume meaning within the static frame of analysis. Nevertheless very often understanding informed by focusing on a point of time contains a certain sense of the past, sensitivity outside the time, and provides the basis to investigate a synchronic tradition in a historical process.23 Sensitivity in history is quite evident, as we have discussed, in the works on village studies.

<sup>23</sup>The argument can be substantiated with reference to Nathan Porath's study (2016: 75–102). Porath has delineated the forces in the process of state intervention and through contacts with other outside forces in Sakai community and the resultant change in the frame of their Shamanic healing complex.

The Shamanic healing complex is an intervention, an exercise of 'making medicine', by which the shaman establishes and brings the boundary between the 'patient' and the 'spirit' disturbed by external forces in order by means of composing songs. Sakai have songs characterizing Arab presence, Chinese presence, Japan's relation, advent of consumerism and the presence of modernity when the Sultan drives a car and so on in their healing complex. We learn cultural absorption to historical forces, and therefore, a study of synchronic tradition gets comprehensive meaning with reference to historical process.

Indian communities, whether tribal or nontribal, have been experiencing the process of interaction in different degrees from historical time as is evident in the records of medieval and epic periods. It is but natural to find a certain sense of history in synchronic community studies. In such studies living traditions are investigated in situ. A contemporary period in the past however cannot be approached through ethnographic methods. In this context historical approach is significant. Reference to historical sources through museums becomes useful to understand a synchronic tradition of the past and compare such traditions across cultures. Such a study leads to a fundamental point by distinguishing between 'the sense of history' in a synchronic investigation at present time period and 'the sense of synchronicity' in the study of a past period.

The latter perspective is linked to the study of tribal cultures through museum exhibits. It takes us to a contemporary understanding of past cultures and the diversity. But a tribe studied as a community does not reflect diversity what juxtaposition of cultural traits of different communities in a museum would reveal (see Dey 2006: 405). In a museum collection mainly consists of hunting and food gathering implements, fishing implements, agricultural implements, household objects, dress and ornaments and objects related to travel and transport, sports and amusement items, rites and rituals and art and crafts of different tribal communities. Collections from a tribe over different periods juxtapose present and past showing changes of biocultural heritage on a time scale and thus provide insights into historical process. *Nilanjan Khatua* in his paper entitled *Envisaging Tribal Culture and Decoding Anthropological Museums* informs us that a museum not only displays contemporary cultural traits but the heritage with reference to past collections, the collections which disappear or get modified in the course of community's exposure to development process. He directs our attention to the 'material culture; which were being acquired for the Zonal Museum in 1950s and 1960s; …are not available now and if a few are found; they lost their indigeneity'. Therefore anthropological museum is a crucial treasure house, as Khatua observes, 'of the tangible evidence of man's history; of his creativeness and traditional knowledge'.

He informs that a museum is a useful and essential medium of mass education of culture and a history of humankind. He has exemplified the role of anthropological museum 'as essential medium of mass education to understand humankind as a whole and different ethnic groups in particular' with Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (IGRMS), Bhopal and Zonal Anthropological Museum, Mysore, as a case study. He has enlisted the activities of IGRMS along with the system of collections and exhibit of ethno-objects for a general understanding of Indian culture and enlargement of the essence of comprehending India.

Similarly he has informed us about Zonal Anthropological Museum that is 'working towards the preservation of intangible cultural heritage after recording of tribal songs, folktales, dialects and speeches of noted personalities, after organizing traditional performing art like leather puppetry and Yakshagana – a traditional folk performance of Karnataka, by making documentary films on tribal culture like Cholanaickan tribe of Kerala, Apatani tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh, etc.'

Importantly he has emphasized the development role of anthropological museum and changing role of curators in the context. He envisions its role and changing role of its curator towards empowering the community people by highlighting their potentialities in preservation of medicinal plants, water harvesting mechanism, traditional architecture, conservation of forest in the form of sacred grooves and other traditional knowledge prevalent among the various communities, in the form of exhibitions. It provides avenue for research and innovation, and not surprisingly museum has emerged as methodological innovation to study tribal culture in a historical perspective (see Dey 2006). This insight is evident in the paper when Khatua argues for simultaneous museological and research activities in a museum, for a 'systematic collection of ethnographic objects not only enrich the Anthropological Museum but also provide the Museum a strong ground as a source of research centre'.

Essentially the museum's role is conceptualized in a dynamic perspective departing from its traditional role of exhibiting museum collections; the perspective linked with museum is its crucial role to address contemporary challenges in the fields of academic and development and thus is interdisciplinary in nature.

Let us place 'the sense of history' in synchronic tradition for an objective understanding. It is instructive to mention that sensitivity in history in earlier synchronic understanding of culture is far from being a conscious effort towards application of historical and anthropological methods in an interdisciplinary perspective. Guha (1987: viii) draws our attention to its nature of unavoidable drift, which is inconsequential and 'of little significance rather than a recognition of epistemological necessity'. Nevertheless understanding of the culture is informed by a sense of the past, though historicity approach remains conspicuously absent. Link to the past reveals through reference to oral traditions' earlier works or use of old concepts. Two papers, namely, *G. Kanato Chophy*'s paper entitled *On Weltanschauung and Witchcraft Among the Indian Tribes* and joint paper of *Tiasunep* and Neingusanuo Solo entitled *Yangpi Morung: An Expression of Ideals and Identity*, come under the above perspective approach. The discussion in the latter is a micro-study on the theme of art in the structural tradition of a village Morung, whereas in the former data are drawn from cross-cultural tradition with a sensitivity of the past to explicate witchcraft as a belief system.

On the other hand, the volume has included papers in which anthropologists consciously combine both historical and anthropological methods to understand the process of culture change or to investigate historical waves to which society and culture were exposed at different time periods. The paper of *Mohammad Nasir Ahmad* entitled *Expressing the Unexpressed: The Minicoy Islanders of Lakshadweep* presents some aspects of cultural life of the Muslim community in Minicoy Island and its outside contact as well. In a slightly different vein, the nature and extent of outside contact, acceptance and resistance, etc. by the tribes are studied by both historians and anthropologists in which understanding of culture has not been the core area of investigation. Sinha Kapur's paper, as mentioned in a foregoing paragraph, is an account of interaction of Bhils with state power and neighbouring communities along with its influence on social formation and occupation. However the role of culture in the process of interaction has not been analysed, though it plays a crucial role in determining the nature and extent of acceptance and resistance by tribal communities to outside forces, both secular and religious. Its merits mention that the role of culture in the process of interaction is at the core of the paper of *Umesh Kumar* entitled *Contact and Conflict: Case of Inhabitants of Andaman Islands*.

Chophy informs us about the tradition of witchcraft practised across the tribal belts of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal and in some caste societies of India and western societies as well. The practice that still exists has a long history as he finds such accounts from a number of works of early decades of twentieth century. The paper has both empirical and theoretical underpinnings. Chophy does not generalize methodological perspective to study the practice everywhere as he cautions us about methodological lacunae when one applies the European witchcraft and witch-hunt model in the Indian context. He attempts to theorize the practice within Heinz Kohut's conceptual frames of 'experience-near' and 'experience-distant' as elaborated by Clifford Geertz. Further he has enriched our theoretical understanding with the ideas and works of Geertz, Needham, Evans-Pritchard and Durkheim.

Drawing on the tradition of witchcraft with reference to Munda and Asur tribes of Jharkhand and Sumi tribe of Nagaland, Chophy focuses on continuity and change of the practice, showing sensitivity in the past as is evident from his reference to oral traditions of the communities and of course in the 'continuity and change' itself. Precisely, he has attempted to give a systematic understanding and a contextual theory for the Indian context keeping in perspective the current ethnographic research and findings on witchcraft especially with reference to Nagaland and Jharkhand. His description is on the phenomenological aspect of the practice, though rationality framework could provide a different logic of its prevalence.

The practice continues, and the occurrences when studied objectively show different causative factors within a broad frame of social inequality and power disparity. Particularly, as Chophy finds from various studies, most of the witchcraft studies in India suggest gender inequality patriarchy, property disputes, land alienation and closed community politics as the main bases of the practice. However the appeal to tradition always hides the real motive. It would not be out of context to state that the practice is manipulated to serve vested interests. In other words, the essence of belief system in the practice is diluted to serve socio-economic interests. In this regard the content and context of the practice show a perspective shift. But Chophy argues, drawing on his field data and ethnographic studies on magic and witchcraft, that witchcraft in essence is a belief system of the community that practises it, for 'belief in magic and witchcraft plays a significant role and occupies a vital space in the tribal cosmology and religious life'. To corroborate his stand, he further maintains that 'the idea of cause and effect in witchcraft is *a priori* to observation and scientific explanation. It is an explanation of life's exigencies and a search for meaning which fails human comprehension'.

Synchronic perspective with a sense of history is evident in the joint paper of Tiasunep and Neingusanuo Solo. The authors have studied the structure of Morung (a sociocultural house often wrongly translated as bachelor's dormitory), wood carvings, paintings and colour pattern, trophies preserved in Morung and other symbols with Yangpi Morung as case study. The Morung is named after the village Yangpi of Chang Naga tribe which comes under Tuensang district of Nagaland. For Christian converts, as Tiasunep and Solo inform us, the motifs are mere art pieces, but the pre-Christian tradition looks at them as expressions of culture in a total perspective. No doubt, the latter tradition attaches cultural meaning of a context different from present Christian worldview. However the meaning reflects in both secular and sacred domains, for the motifs symbolize bravery, ferocity, toughness, reward for bravery, beauty and beliefs and practices. These motifs, as is discussed in the paper, tell us about the story of migration, tradition of 'head-hunting', social values, social status and livelihood pursuits like shifting cultivation and hunting. The secular dimensions of motifs are however not independent of beliefs and practices, for painting is linked with sacred ideals of restrictions and rituals.

Needless to say, the motifs convey cultural meanings of pre-Christian tradition of the Naga tribe. Tiasunep and Solo argue that the art in Morung 'serves as a vessel that encapsulates the essence of the culture of Yangpi. Thus, the art was not detached from other cultural elements but it was immersed in the very fabric of their common culture'.

Implicitly the study suggests two time periods in the context of pre-Christian and Christian traditions of the Naga people. The study of existing motifs with reference to pre-Christian context of oral tradition and earlier writings convey the sense of history. In terms of Christian worldview, the study follows synchronic tradition of investigation. Essentially the authors have attempted to weave the fabric of change and continuity of Chang Naga ideals and identity. Tiasunep and Solo are aware of this perspective when they write, 'Morung house has more to inform us- How they understood themselves; what they aspired to be; what they would wish to inculcate to the new members and how they wanted to express and display about who they are'.

However Morung does not stand as witness to a culture of bye gone days. Its changing context is shaped through the ideals of Christianity. Therefore the authors maintain that 'values reflected in their Morung was the pride and identity of their ancestors; the values from the Church now take its place'.

As has been mentioned, *Mohammad Nasir Ahmad* has attempted a synchronic study of Minicoy islanders and some aspects of their culture. Unlike Chophy and Tiasunep and Solo, Ahmad has used historical data consciously as epistemological necessity for an informed understanding of crucial dynamics of existing island culture. Methodologically the paper is an interdisciplinary approach, more in the line of historical anthropology than ethnohistory, to study the people and their social-cultural life in a historical perspective, though a few existing practices clearly show a link with the past when they adopted Islam.

Ahmad and Singh inform us islanders' connections with different people, rulers, traders, etc. from a long past based on historical data. Their present religious tradition owes its origin to the historical process, but a little explanation is offered to link other aspects of contemporary life to historical time period. However many of such practices, like matrilinity, continue from historical time as is informed with reference to Marco Polo who had referred to Minicoy as the 'female island' because of its matrilineal society. Interestingly a unique coexistence of matrilinity and Islam marks a tradition of change and continuity in the process of acculturation. The author informs us that the islanders practise monogamy and community ownership of resources and maintain matrilineal institutions along with rites to passage, particularly marriage rituals, for which they follow Islamic tenets. Unlike patriarchal power relations at the core of Islamic tradition, Minicoy islanders have preserved pre-Islamic tradition of matriarchal power relations which can be explained as a crude form of syncretism (cf. Das 2003, 2016; Sahay 2016; Bharadwaj 2016) in the process of acculturation.

In tribal worldview the perspective of human relations, relation of human (a tribal person) with human within the tribe, and with other tribes and nontribal, is a culturally constructed phenomenological expression in the broader human-nature and supernature complex (Vidyarthi 1963; Adhikari 1984). The whole complex is disturbed when any part of the complex is affected. Right from colonial period, tribes are exposed to outside coercive forces, actual or perceived, which redefine tribal relations with outsiders and affect the perspective of human relations in their worldview directly. Changing outside relations mostly interfere tribal autonomy to which they dislike and so resist (see Xaxa 2018). Tribal resistances during colonial period are read as consequences of interventions restricting or denying them autonomy in one or the other affairs. The very nature of intervention was not welcome by the tribes. Umesh Kumar maintains that the cruel and vindictive policy of the British officials posted in the area stood on the way of the tribals to enjoy their autonomy and so generated among the aborigines a definite spirit of hostility with a determination to drive the colonizers out from their habitat.

Human-nature-supernature complex is a phenomenological expression of a culture. It is an organic whole, and any part of it, if changes, affects the whole complex. In other words, any intervention into the complex affects the culture, though degree may vary on the basis of nature and intensity of it. The interventions are causes, and changes in the culture are effects. The effects are approached applying either synchronic or diachronic approach. In synchronic tradition historiography information remains unexplained, and phenomena are simply described, though sometimes a sense of history becomes apparent 'as an inconsequential...drift …as a conventional nod of little significance rather than a recognition of epistemological necessity' (Guha 1987: viii). Contrarily in diachronic study, phenomena are understood with informed historiography, a conscious use of historical methods to explicate cultural phenomena. But there are studies with focus on historical process in which culture appears as an inconsequential drift. Implicitly history provides causal factors to understand contemporary culture as it appears and why it appears so.

This is the essence of Umesh Kumar's paper where he discusses the history of tribal resistance in Andaman Islands during colonial interventions and the process of integration through confrontation and conciliation after India's Independence. The impact on resource use has been the crucial issue of investigation. The methodological assumption varies from Sinha Kupur's presentation in that she is a historian

studying historical relations where cultural aspects are inconsequential, while Umesh Kumar is an anthropologist (ecological) whose disciplinary perspective is basically an understanding of culture. It can be inferred that his focus on history is an epistemological necessity to understand culture which is implicit in his study but reflects in terms of tribal relations with outsiders, land and other resources and changing livelihood options.

While colonial administration and tribes of Andaman Islands were at wars, the missionaries undertook the task of civilizing them. The tribes were of course tamed but at the loss of autonomy. The fallout of attacks and civilizing mission was sudden decline in the population of Negrito groups in Andaman Islands from 600 in 1858 to 120 in 1931. During colonial contact their access to territorial space and resource base also declined. The territorial organization of tribal groups, particularly of Andamanese groups, was delineated by specific names, and as Umesh Kumar informs us, many groups disappeared from traditional habitats due to colonial intervention or inter-tribe feuds to which colonial occupation of traditional tribal land contributed significantly.

Umesh Kumar reports that out of the ten groups of the Great Andamanese, only three, namely, the Aka-Chari, Aka-Jeru and the Aka-Bea-da, were surviving with a total population of 19 in 1961. With no control over their former territory, they lived in miserable condition in and around Port-Blair till they were settled at Strait Island in 1970.

It is not out of context to state that colonial rule reduced the tribes from resource owners to resource refugees, and it is a pity that they depended upon the dole provided by the administration which continued even after Independence in the process of planned interventions.

Like colonial period, shrinkage and demarcation of tribal territory and additional competition with refugees settled by the government for resource use continued after Independence. Due to increase in outside population demand for resource increased, often leading to illegal exploitation. As a result, shrinkage of resource base proved detrimental to the foraging lifestyle of foraging tribes. Precisely, Umesh Kumar discusses the process of transformation of Andamanese from enjoying autonomy to adopting to constitutional status through stages of retaliation and conciliation and the nature of contact with administration, colonial and post-colonial and settled refugees from mainland of India. In the process loss of territory, resource base, autonomy and self-reliance of tribes has been highlighted in the paper.

Conventional anthropology applies synchronic approach to study communityspecific tribal cultures, sometimes also in comparative perspectives, but consciously ignores sense of history in it. This tradition has changed over the years, and perspective approaches of different disciplines are applied to investigate a culture/ community and its dynamics. As a result, the discipline of tribal studies is growing through multidisciplinary approaches. The papers included in this volume contribute to tribal studies along the line of multidisciplinary approaches, particularly with focus on history, archaeology and culture/ethnography. Historical or archaeological investigations, as it is evident, cover the anthropological unit of community as the basis, but instead of being specific in conformity with anthropological objectives of micro investigation, the papers display methodological generalizability across similar contexts. History is not confined to showcase the dead past nor the archaeology, but they attempt at examining cause and effect relationship in cultural changes and reconstructing sociocultural and political history of tribal people who are alleged not having a 'sense of history'. The interdisciplinary trend revealed through individual papers is an academic commitment towards liberating tribal studies from the monopoly of disciplinary possession.
