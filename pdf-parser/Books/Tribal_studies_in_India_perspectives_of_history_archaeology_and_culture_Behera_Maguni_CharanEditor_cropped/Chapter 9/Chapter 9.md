**Abstract** The paper argues that anthropological understanding of tribal communities in the north-eastern part of India would be insightful in the process of formulation of the ethnohistorical processes as these communities have been or still are in a pre-literate stage. Many of the age old practices considered as extinct facts of archaeology are still continuing in tribal societies as Living Archaeology. Understandably, the paper pleads for methodological innovation in an interdisciplinary perspective in the discipline of archaeology. Since archaeology is basically concerned with reconstruction of the extinct societies based on material traces the simple facts of material culture of the tribal societies would be immensely helpful in understanding the past present continuum of these societies. In view of this the paper has made use of etnnoarchaeological approach to study the past of a few tribal communities of Assam and adjoining areas.

## **Introduction**

Understanding of the prehistory and early history of the ethnic communities of Northeast India has been a difficult task due to lack of written records and scientifically excavated archaeological materials. The demarcating line between what is understood as prehistory and history in this region is also very difficult to trace unlike the rest part of the country. The territorial diversities in terms of landscapes which vary from high mountainous zones of the Himalayas to the low floodplains of the Brahmaputra present a unique situation. Diversities in terms of physical attributes of the landscape are further accentuated by the ethnic variations, the intensity of which can be felt in the hilly terrains of the region. The hilly terrains of the

regions are the abode of cultural diversities in terms of beliefs, practices, subsistence strategies, dialects/languages, etc. Moreover, from the prehistoric anthropological perspective, the region was a diffusing space of cultures of Southeast Asia and mainland India which has been termed as the Great Indian Corridor. This can very well be exemplified by the following quotes from D.K. Medhi (2002: 25):

The writer has been using the term to mean the Northeast Indian territories or the Assam region since the ultimate decade of the last century. To him, the term appears appropriate when the region saw the human migration from the Southeast Asia and China on one hand and the mainland India on the other. Subsequently a mixed colourful culture developed here with the admixture of the great Mongoloid and the Indo-Aryan cultures over the years. And obviously prehistory and archaeology of the region reflect the tangible and intangible impressions of these two great cultures of the world.

Under such a condition, sporadic archaeological remains scattered on the surface, and associated ecofacts are the materials which can be fruitfully studied to know the past of these communities as well as the dynamics of inter-territorial migration and cultural diffusion through ages in this region. Interestingly, many prehistoric traditions have survived among the ethnic groups of this part of India which have an overt manifestation. The living megalithic tradition, shifting cultivation, ethno-ceramics and culinary practices are such instances which indicate the continuation of archaeological evidence in the ethnographic context. Various tribes of Northeast India still practise many of the prehistoric and ancient traditions. The erection of megaliths as a post-cremation rite by the Karbis of Assam and the erection of megaliths for commemorative and funerary purposes by the Khasis of Meghalaya and the Nagas of Nagaland beside the food preparation and preservation techniques, to mention a few, are some of such examples. The Garos in the Assam-Meghalaya border areas similarly utilize many of the pottery types which have in use since undated period. The shifting cultivation prevalent among the Garos of the said areas also reflects a prehistoric tradition in continuity in a changed context. An attempt has therefore been made in the present essay to highlight these dimensions of the aforesaid tribal communities of the region which signify the existence of archaeology in ethnographic context.

## **The Living Megalithic Practice**

As mentioned earlier, megalithic tradition has survived as a living practice among some tribal communities in eastern, central and northeastern part of India. Furer Haimendorf (1945: 76) reports that the Bastar Gond, Hill Marias, Dorlas and Murias erect *uraskal* (menhir) and sometimes *danyakal* (dolmen) as memorial to the dead, and the erection is generally accompanied by feast and the sacrifice of a cow and a bullock. Similarly, among the Mundas of Chota Nagpur, large stone slabs are put to cover certain graves and dolmen supported by smaller stones serving as family burial place where bones of the family members are buried. Other Munda-speaking tribes and Hos also have identical megalithic practices. The Gadabas and Bondos of Odisha have the tradition of erecting menhirs, dolmens and stone circles for commemorative and funerary purposes. Stone erection with a feast of merit is reported among the Gadabas too. Similarly, Bondos erect menhirs when the head of the village dies. Beside stones, some tribes also have the practice of erecting wooden post. The Koyas of Hyderabad erect a temporary forked post on the place where the memorial feast is performed. It is to be noted that on such occasions, the sacrificial cows are invariably tied to these posts. Square wooden posts are also erected by the Korkus of west central India and Raj Gonds of Hyderabad in course of the memorial feast of the dead individual. Large stone slabs, locally known as *sasandri*, cover certain graves like the dolmen supported by smaller stones and serve as family burial place.

Northeast India occupies a prominent place in the archaeological map of the world because of the rich megalithic remains. It is one of the few places in the world where this practice has still survived as a living practice. Realizing the significance of NE Indian megaliths, J.P. Mills and J.H. Hutton (1929: 285) report, 'An ethno archaeological characteristic of Assam is worldwide fame in its wealth of megaliths. Indeed it is one of the few places in the world where monuments of this type are still erected'. According to Clarke (1874: 487), although none of the megalithic structures of the Northeast India has yet been dated, the custom of megalithic erection prevailed here from prehistoric period. In NE India, megaliths are spread over a wide territory across the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, NC Hills, Karbi Anglong, Nagaon, Morigaon and Kamrup districts of Assam and eastern part of Meghalaya. T.C. Sharma (1984: 17) comments that the greatest concentration of megaliths in NE India is observed in the Khasi and Jaintia hills districts of Meghalaya and that the region houses some of the largest pieces of menhirs. Some of the tribal societies of Northeast India are reported to have elaborate practices of megalithic erection.

The Khasis and the Nagas of Northeast India are known to have the culture of megalithic erection. Various sections of the Naga tribes like the Ao, Angami, Sema, Maram, Rengama, Kanyak and others are known to have this practice among them. In the course of field investigation, it was found that the western Angamis used to erect menhirs both as monument to the dead and also as memorials of social accomplishments.1 Rich men put up menhirs in the course of great feast of merit by which they gain social prestige and rank. Even when a menhir is erected in the honour of the dead man, a feast of merit must be held by his son in the name of the deceased person and erect stones to enhance the prestige of the living. Beside menhirs, sitting places of stones sometimes consisting of several ascending rows of seats are erected by the Nagas to contain the grave of clan ancestors. N.S. Sen (1981: 43) writes that among the Nagas, whose megaliths do not seem very closely linked with the cult of the dead, the thought of the afterlife is not completely absent. Sen (1981) perhaps made this remark to emphasise that Naga megalithic erection is generally associated with community events and ceremonies and sometimes as funerary stones.

<sup>1</sup>Social accomplishment may include events like setting up of a village meeting ground or market place.

Ceremonial feast of the Angamis is of seven grades, according to their cost, size and duration. Erection of only wooden monuments commemorates feast of the sixth grade. On the other hand, monoliths are erected as memorials to those of the seventh. The Angamis believe that a man dies seven times each time falling to a deeper underworld; so, one purpose of the feast of merit is meant for upliftment of the soul of the donor after his death.

The Khasi menhirs are erected in a linear pattern that generally consists of uneven number of stones.2 The tallest of the stones is generally placed at the middle and is occasionally ornamented with a small stone. These groups of Khasi megaliths may probably represent clan burial. In the front of the line of the menhirs, a large flat table stone resting on stone support is placed. The largest table stone is to be seen at Nartiang in the Jaintia hills and Lailongkoti in the Khasi hills of Northeast India. Sometimes two table stones are found parallel to one another. The table stones are always placed towards the middle of the group generally in front of the great central menhir. These groups of stones are usually situated along the road where they readily attract the attention of passersby. Gurdon (1914: 152) classifies the megaliths of the Khasis into the following three groups: (i) menhirs or vertical stones, (ii) table stones or dolmen stone and (iii) cromlechs or cairn.

S.N. Rao (1993:110), however, classifies the megaliths of Khasi hills into two broad groups: (i) funerary stones and (ii) memorial stones. The funerary stones are directly associated with the post-cremation rituals including the disposal of the remains of the deceased. Memorial stones include the menhirs and the table stones which are put up by the clansmen to commemorate the dead or an event. The megalithic tradition of the Khasis tells about a closely knit matrilineal tradition. A prominent position is given to the eldest maternal uncle that is reflected in the stone monuments with a taller central memorial stone (*mawkni*) erected in his memory, thus reflecting the matrilineal solidarity in the Khasi social organization.

Stone circles erected as memorials for rich tribesmen are reported among the Nagas. Hutton (1922) reports that the Marring villages of Nagaland have, as their sacred enclosures, circles of stones with a stone in the middle. Shakespeare (1914: 35) writes that there are records of Naga circle of 32 large stones in conjunction with a row of 14 menhirs within which ritual dances are held at an annual feast in commemoration of the dead. Such circular enclosures made up of smaller stones are known as *kpep* among the Khasis, but these are not a common type among them as in case of the Nagas.

Erection of stone in the form a menhir with a table stone in front is still prevalent among the Karbis living in the plains areas of undivided Kamrup, Nagaon and Morigaon districts of Assam as a post-cremation rite. Compared to their hill counterparts, the plain area Karbis mainly inhabiting parts of southern Kamrup, Nagaon and Morigaon districts of Assam has undergone through the process of acculturation, and many elements of Assamese caste Hindu society have penetrated into their lifeways. But stone erection as post-cremation rite has still survived among them as

<sup>2</sup>Menhirs are erected in uneven numbers because the tallest one in the middle is considered as uncle stone erected to commemorate the maternal uncle.

**Table 9.1** Comparison of megalithic practice (author)

a living example of an ancient tradition. The practice of erection of a vertically placed stone in the form a menhir, locally known as *Long-e,* along with another flat stone slab placed on three or more pieces of smaller stones, locally called *Longdang*, is followed by them after the death of a person. The ceremony is observed generally after 1 month of the death of the person and is marked by chanting of hymns in different steps and ceremonial offerings of fowl and pig meat and *horlang* (rice beer of the Karbis) by family members and relatives of the deceased. Although variation exists in the practices from village to village, there is an overall uniformity in the rite. An analysis of the hymns chanted on the occasion of megalithic erection among the Karbis reveals that besides propitiation of the soul of the deceased, there is an undertone of fertility aspect in it.3 The sacrifice of animal and fowl associated with the practice also supplements to this contention. The practice has been recorded in detail by the present author (Bezbaruah 2012: 205).

Compared to the Nagas and the Khasis, the structural significance of the Karbi megaliths is not that elaborate. The dominant megalithic structures of the Karbis are menhir and menhir with a table stone in the front. Structures similar to the third type are also recorded from Indonesia by Perry (1918: 67) who has used the term dissolith for these structures. The functional aspect of the menhir in the Karbi society is the representation of the deceased which is similar to a great extent to other tribes like the Nagas and the Khasis. So far the ritual aspect is concerned, all tribal communities have elaborate rites followed by animal sacrifice. The Karbis in the past were also reported to have erected memorial stones. Such stones as recorded by Stack and Lyall (1997: 42) were set up by the Karbis only in the memory of the important personage such as the *Sarthe* or *Sarlars.*<sup>4</sup> Table 9.1 presents the differences

<sup>3</sup>The hymns chanted on the occasion of erecting megaliths among the Karbis living in the plains of Assam on translation reveal that there is a wish that the crops and cattle flourish in the village and the family of the deceased.

<sup>4</sup>Sarthe or Sarlars according to Stack and Lyall (1997) is village headman or a government recognized land revenue collector.

and similarities in the megalithic practices of the Nagas, the Khasis, the Karbis and tribes of central India.

An analysis of the erection of megaliths prevalent among certain communities of Northeast India reveals many absorbing facts. First, it confirms the place of these communities in the eastern India megalithic complex, and this can further be extended to establish its link with Southeast Asia. This Southeast Asian belt is defined on the basis of its uniformity in structural, sociocultural and territorial aspects. It further indicates the presence of a more devolved form of worshipping the dead, which is well knit to their sociocultural system. The ritualistic use of rice beer and sacrifice of birds and animals to commemorate and worship the ancestor has been doubtlessly a part of the religious system of the early people. Furer Haimendorf (1945: 76) thus elaborates his argument:

Ethnologically it is important that this megalithic culture of the Southeast Asiatic type, as we may conveniently call it, is mainly concentrated among tribes of well developed agricultural civilisations, characterised by the use of hoes, shifting cultivation on hill- fields and sometimes also permanent cultivation on irrigated terraces and the keeping of cattle for slaughter, but not for use in the yoke or for milking. It is not found in the more primitive strata of Indian aboriginal cultures, neither the food gatherers and hunters, such as the Chenchus and the jungle tribes of the Southwest, nor the early digging-stick cultivators, such as the Baigas, show any trace of megalithic ritual.

The Karbis who still practise megalithic erection have a developed agricultural system characterized by wet cultivation together with shifting cultivation. An examination of the hymns chanted by the *Kathar*, the Karbi priest on the occasion of megalithic erection, reflects a deep concern over the well-being of the crops and cattle besides propitiating the soul of the dead which indicates an underlying principle of fertility and generation behind megalithic erection among them and belief that their land and herd belonged to them because their forbearers had owned them. This conforms well to the observation made by S. Sen (1991: 3) who states:

The spread of megalithic culture was associated with the cult of the ancestor (though not necessarily universal) as well as the principle of fertility and generation. Among the early farming communities the processes of birth and generation and those of fertility appeared to be so intimate that the two aspects of the same mystery found symbolic expressions in their customs and rituals.

A group of scholars motivated by Heine-Geldern (1928: 301) proposes the association of Neolithic culture with the spread of megalithic ritual in Asia. According to this view, people with Quadrangular Adze Culture speaking early forms of Malayo-Polynesian languages were responsible for spread of the megalithic culture in Southeast Asia and eastern India. These groups pushed through Indonesia and beyond taking with them the cult of megaliths. In their progress in mainland Southeast Asia, they met and mixed up with men of another culture of mainland Southeast Asia known as shouldered axe culture associated with people speaking languages of Mon-Khmer type who learnt the use of megalith from people with Quadrangular Adze Culture. Possibly some of them migrated to India taking their megalithic culture with them and became one of the ancestors of the Mundaspeaking tribes of more recent time. This hypothesis presupposes a relationship

between the Mon-Khemr and the Munda language. The Neolithic materials from Indonesia and Pacific suggest that there has been an amalgamation of these two industries which occurred probably in the Asiatic mainland and resulted in the polished shouldered adze with quadrangular section as reported by Furer Haimendorf (1945). Exploration in Karbi Anglong has resulted in the discovery of polished shouldered adze with quadrangular section as reported by Medhi (1999: 32), and this has further substantiated the observation made by Furer Haimendorf (1945) who himself collected similar Neolithic tool type from the Naga Hills.

The survival and continuity of the megalithic practice among the ethnic communities of Northeast India can be examined in the light of the observations made by S.N. Rao (1977: 204) in his scholarly discussion on the survival and continuity of Neolithic tradition in Northeast India. He thus commented:

In the case of Northeast India, the environment exerts a profound influence on cultural development, resulting in the continuity and survival of cultures from the prehistoric past down to the present. The nuclear area of Brahmaputra Valley with its fertile alluvial plains has fostered in its lap a civilisation characterised by relative complexity. The *cul de sac* or areas of isolation show a harmonious of adjustment of physical and cultural environment, enabling the hill folk to subsist on jhumming or shifting cultivation supplement by hunting and fishing. It is in the area of isolation that we can trace this cultural continuity and survival.

The megalithic communities of erstwhile Assam have been living in isolation for years in an environment that reflects a harmonious adjustment of physical and cultural environment which can well be understood even with a cursory observation on the life of the communities about whom reference has already been made. Under such conditions many prehistoric traditions have continued to survive including the prehistoric megalithic erection.

#### **Shifting Cultivation**

Most of the tribal communities are practising shifting cultivation. The Nagas of Nagaland, the Reangs of Tripura, the Khasis and Garos of Meghalaya and the Karbis of Karbi Anglong are practitioners of shifting cultivation or slash and burn cultivation. The importance of this cultivation is the use of simple technology with its continuation from the prehistoric past. This may be substantiated by the example of tools and implements used for the purposes of jhum cultivation by the Garos. These tools are simple, and some of them are replicas of the Neolithic tools except for the raw material. Their technology of preparing jhum field by cutting and burning the jungle is the evidence of continuation of the Neolithic slash and burn cultivation. The traditional shifting cultivation being in practice in the Garo Hills has a prehistoric base. The hoe and axe continue as the principal tools, operated exclusively by human energy. We cannot say whether the people of the culture under study are the descendent of the Neolithic population; but analogy between the material cultures of the past and present should not be ignored. Chronologically, the culture under study is modern but economically Neolithic (Roy 1981).

There are differences in the raw material of the tools. Formerly they were made of stone; at present they are made of iron. However, the digging stick which was used during the prehistoric past and is used at present is made of locally procured wood. Such a difference does not result in a major variation in the quantity of production between past and present. The hoe and axe have inherent limitations in working capability. Such a technology, under the given ecological conditions, can support only four to five persons per square kilometre. Under the traditional agricultural system, intensification contributes little to improvement, as was the case during Neolithic times as well (Roy 1981).

Slash and burn cultivation is practised even today among the Garos of Ganapati village situated in Assam-Khasi Hill Border Region in the south western part of Kamrup district of Assam near the village Rani. The villagers of Ganapati practise their cultivation on the slope of Khasi hills, where the streamlet known as Umci-rani originates. The local term for slash and burn cultivation used by the Garos is 'Arri'. The people of the village select the sites on the hill slopes far away from their houses; it is almost 2.5 kms on an average from their residential area. The jhum fields are usually located at the back side of the village, and it takes about 1 h and 20 min to reach the fields on foot. Some of the hill slopes used for jhum cultivation are under the territorial jurisdiction of the Assam government, and some areas are under the Meghalaya government. Abundant availability of land has not necessitated individual demarcation, and the land is used on a first come first use basis.

#### **Procedure of Slash and Burn Cultivation**

The common procedure of carrying out slash and burn cultivation is that a suitable plot of land on a hill slope is selected, and the trees, bamboos and shrubs, etc. grown over it are cut in the winter season during the months of November and December. It is allowed to be dried under the blazing summer sun. Later on, fire is set on the debris, and the ashes thus produced are scattered over the whole plot of land. Finegrained seeds of paddy, cotton, etc. are broadcast, while bigger varieties of seeds like gourd, maize and pumpkin are sowed with the help of digging stick over the area with the advent of the monsoon. Weeding takes place after the sowing of the seeds. At the same time along with the sowing of seeds, they also plant tapioca, arum, sweet potato, pineapple, etc. on the plot. The seeds mature in the month of December, and it is worth mentioning that the Garos do not harvest the crops by cutting the crops; rather they collect the ripe grains in small bamboo basket called *Thapa* and keep it in a bigger bamboo basket called *Duni* to carry the harvested products to their respective households. After collecting the harvest, other vegetables like tomato, chilly, etc. are planted in the same plot. The cultivation is carried out by the villagers on their own, and often family members and fellow villagers help each other in carrying out the process of cultivation. A plot of land used for slash and burn cultivation is used twice in a year. After cultivation in the plot for a year or two, they grow broom sticks, beetle nut, orange plants, pineapples, banana plants, etc., and the plot of land is used for cultivation for 1 or 2 years. After 2 or 3 consecutive years of cultivation, the land is left fallow. Sometimes the field once cultivated is kept fallow for many years and sometimes even for a period of 12–15 years as the fertility of the soil exhausted after cultivation gets time to recuperate and trees grow up sufficiently to be cut down for ashes. Then a new plot of land is selected for the purpose. Thus the cycle continues in rotation, and the production from jhum field is sufficient for the subsistence of the villagers. Women are found to be more involved and active than their male counterparts in jhum fields.

### **Implements Used**

The people of the studied village use various types of implement in the jhum field. These implements are generally used for cleaning, weeding and tilling purpose. Some of the implements are used for broadcasting seeds. Hoe, which is known as *gitchi*, is generally used for weeding purpose. Digging sticks are used in sowing seeds. *Gitchi* is their all-purpose tool, which they use in wet cultivation also. The implements used by Garos are presented in Table 9.2.

All these implements are locally prepared from raw materials available in the surroundings except the iron ones which are procured from the market. The utility of the implements particularly in the particular physical setting for the particular subsistence can well be understood from an anthropological perspective. The angular *gitchi* and the *khokchi* with a string to tie with the head are particularly considered indispensable for jhum cultivation in a hilly terrain.

#### **Pottery Tradition**

Many of the tribal societies are culturally linked to the pottery tradition since the prehistoric past, and it is worth mentioning in this regard that the first trace of pottery in this region was recovered from the hills of erstwhile North Cachar Hills district in a site called Daojali Hading (Goswami and Sharma 1963). In the succeeding period, many such traces of pottery have been recovered, the important among them being the ones recovered from the Assam Meghalaya borders particularly in the Sarutaru and Marogdola (Rao 1977), Bambooti (Ashraf and Duarah 2014) and Rani Ganapati villages. An account of the pottery which have been recovered from the Rani Ganapati area is given below.

#### **Pottery Findings from Rani Ganapati**

The location where pottery remains have been recorded in the Ganapati village lies in the foothills of the Khasi hills with thick and luxuriant vegetation all around. At present the area is mainly inhabited by the Garos, but it also lies on the foot track of the Khasis and the Karbis. The stream Umci-rani cascades down near the site with strong course and a bed marked by rapids and falls. One of the large stones in the bed of the river showed formation of a pothole due to fluvial action.

The most engrossing feature of the area for archaeological studies was the presence of ceramic sherds, ranging from very small to medium fragments scattered over the entire area in abundance. Even the front and backyards of the houses of the local people and the un-graveled road towards Umci-rani evidenced voluminous number of ceramic pieces.

Later recoveries were made out of the two road cutting sections and parts of the river bed, i.e. the transparent surface of Umci-rani flowing through the backyards of the households.

The collections from both the contexts are recorded and described below.

#### *Road Cutting Sections*

#### **Road Cutting Section-I**

Most of the findings from road cutting sections have been drawn from this section. Out of these, 22 pieces were sherds with rim, 3 pieces were sherds with base contain, and a total of 28 numbers of body sherds have been generated from this road cutting section. Notably, a small full potlike object has been recovered from this section having holes on both orifice and base. The vertical length of this section is 64 cm.

#### **Road Cutting Section-II**

A total of 33 numbers of ceramic sherds were drawn from this section. Out of these, rim sherds contain 7 pieces, while body sherds consist of 26 numbers of potsherds. The vertical length of the section is 67 cm.

Hence, both the road cutting sections jointly produced a total of 86 numbers of pottery fragments. Altogether, 29 pieces (33.72%) of sherds with rim, 3 pieces (3.48%) of lease sherds and 54 pieces (62.79%) of sherds from other parts were collected.

#### **River Bed (Umci-rani) Collections**

The Umci-rani flows through the backyards of the residential houses of Ganapati, and its underwater surface is not much deep. All the collections have been drawn from the downstream of Umci-rani. On the whole, 22 potsherds have been gathered up of which 8 numbers (36.36%) are rim sherds count, 1 piece (4.54%) base sherd and 13 pieces are body sherds (59.09%).

The produced pottery fragments of Ganapati (from both the contexts, i.e. river bed and road cutting sections) maintain uniformity as regards their shapes, sizes, techniques and attributes as well. The rim types show predominance of out-turned rim in both the contexts. All of the sherds were wheel thrown having applied slip. A few sherds differ in the rim type from the rest, exhibiting types like straight, direct, recurved, etc. Almost all the sherds show use of well-levigated clay and well firing. Groove is present in few rim sherds. Regarding the bases, all show flat base.

The shape and size of the sherds indicate that a few of them were probably used for storing purposes, while the bases were also perhaps used in ritualistic storing.

A glance into the ceramic findings from the context of excavation shows close resemblance regarding the attributes and techniques to those recovered from the road cutting sections and river (Umci-rani) contexts. Furthermore, the postsherds like the spouted portion of vessel, bases and reconstructed vessels show similarity with the Ambari (Guwahati) ceramic types in some respect like shape, colour and manufacturing techniques, etc. (Roy 2005).

It can be inferred from the analyses and interpretation of all the recoveries from Ganapati and Rani, from all the contexts, viz. riverbed and road-cutting sections, that the site may occupy more and more significant place in the archaeological map of Northeast India, if further research into the area is done more scientifically and systematically. At the preliminary level of study, it has been found that various shapes of the pottery like the hundis, pitcher, storage jar and smaller bowls are still used by the Garos of the village and the fact of continuity from past to the present in this respect can not be denied.

#### **Culinary Practice**

To utilize the principle of present reflecting the past, some of the situations that exist today as the systems and practices among the modern tribal societies of Northeast India have been discussed. Storage and preservation of foods in a bamboo rack constructed atop the fireplace in a tribal house in Northeast India is a common scene. The items that are stored include a variety of food items like a few vegetables, fish and meat. This practice's distinctiveness has two aspects: it is a regular way of storage of food and it is partly a casual one. The important part of this system is a concept of preservation of food stuffs, as well as seeds of different agricultural items from the attack of flies and other pests. Smoke that emits from the fireplace becomes the preservative reagent in conservation of different vegetable and food items kept on the rack above the fireplace. This dynamic practice of the tribal societies is a result of a similar practice that existed among the extinct societies and also among the contemporary societies like the Eskimos who preserve the reindeer meat inside their igloos for every forthcoming summer. The fermented fish preserved in bamboo tubes by the Garos of Meghalaya is much important if we look at our modern society's practice of making many food items and also pickles (Medhi 2002). Partial burning of food stuff for purpose of storage highlights another aspect of research connected with cooking of food. Cooking without vessel and cooking with vessel are two important devices of food preparation. In a number of Northeast India societies, cooking of a foodstuff directly in fire is a most common practice. In fact, the food is not burnt and is either roasted, baked or steamed in fire. Roots, tubers, stems, vegetables, fish and meat are cooked without a vessel, and they are put directly inside the burning coals of firewood for a certain period of time, and later they are brought out and taken on partial cooling.

The process of food preservation and the cooking as well inform an ethnoarchaeologist about the earliest food habit of human who must have taken the first cooked food without vessel, which was cooked, naturally in wild fire (see Medhi 2002). Field data from the Garos of Garopara in Assam Meghalaya border region in west Kamrup have indicated the varied traditional food items as below:

## **Food Preservation and Processing Among the Garos of Ganapati in Assam-Khasi Hill Border**

Among the Garo people, the food preservation is widely seen. They mainly preserve fish, meat and different types of roots and seeds of vegetables. The method of drying process of meat and fish is given below.

*Dried Meat* They dry meat in fire for 3 or 4 days at intervals, and these dried meat are preserved for some days. A rack is built over the hearth, and in that rack meat is kept. The heat of the fire dries the meat. The dried pork (*walk-pen-rana*) is the most favourite item among them.

*Dried Fish* The preparation method is almost same as with dried meat. It takes 1 or 2 days for drying the fishes. The dried fish (*Nakam*) is another favourite delicacy among them.

The people also preserve different types of seeds and roots. Some seeds are brought to their home and kept for 1 year, while some are preserved in the jhum filed. Pumpkin (*Jagnnat*), sesame (*Isphan*), maize *(Me-rakhu*), etc. are brought to house; their seeds are kept for 1 year. Ginger (*Ischang*), tapioca (*Tha*), cucumber (*Themot*), roots of banana, etc. are preserved in the jhum filed for 1 year.

The Garos take meal twice a day: in the morning before going to jhum field and at dusk. Rice is the staple food. They mostly prefer different types of green vegetables, tapioca-fresh or dried and the fragmented fishes in bamboo tube and meat, etc. They prefer dried meat of chicken, pork, etc. They rarely use oil or ghee; they mostly prefer boiled food items. They cook herb or vegetables in water with plenty of chili, peppers, alkali (plantain ash), salt, turmeric powder, onion, etc. and consume this curry along with boiled rice, pork, mutton, chicken and beef. Caterpillars are also similarly eaten.

The villagers of Ganapati prepare various types of traditional cakes from rice and other grains during special occasions such as Christmas, Good Friday or January 1. The different types of traditional cakes are *Dhamapitha*, *Punavat*, *Junpitha*, *Til pitha*, *Rasomita*, etc. *Dhamapitha* is a kind of rice cake made of rice powder mixed with water and paste of sesame and coconut.

- *Punavat* (a kind of rice cake): In this rice cake, the ingredients are coconut, sesame and rice powder. All these ingredients are placed in layers from the outer to the inner part. At first rice powder is placed, then the sesame followed by grinded coconut, and at the top most layer again rice powder is kept. All these ingredients give a delicious taste to the cake. Sometimes they prepare this rice cake with the help of steaming technique by mixing and wrapping all these ingredients in a banana leaf. Though the process is different, the name is same.
- *Junpitha* (a kind of rice cake): This is another type of cake which is prepared by them in their special occasions. At first rice powder is mixed with water and grinded coconut, and a paste is prepared. The paste is steamed with the vapour of the kettle by wrapping with a piece of cloth, and the cake is prepared.

Rice beer was one of the favourite drinks among them in earlier days. But nowadays they do not prepare rice beer in their home because their religious norms and practices (they being converted to Christianity) do not permit them. This traditional food item was prepared 1 day before the celebration. Each and every person, whether rich or poor, prepares food items on different occasions. In Christmas, every household prepares these traditional foods. Even poor people borrow money so that they can prepare these items. But on the occasion of good Friday or January 1, if some family is financially weak, then they do not celebrate it in grand and pompous manner; they celebrate it in a simple form. In these special occasions, all the village people gather in their church, and a great feast is arranged where each and every person gets a packet of rice and meat. This rice and meat are packed in the banana leaf (*There bijak*). The items are generally prepared by village women.

### **Methods of Preserving and Processing of Food**

There are different methods of food preservation practices adopted by the Garos of Ganapati. These are:

- (i) *Drying*: This is one of the important methods used by the villagers. They mainly use this method in the drying purpose of fishes and meat. The dried fish and meat, as has been mentioned earlier, are favourite item of the villagers.
- (ii) *Smoking*: This is another method used by the people of Ganapati. Through this method, people used to prepare different types of items. They smoke fish, meat and also sometimes some vegetables such as potato, tomato, etc.
- (iii) *Boiling*: This is one of the popular methods which is practised by them. They mainly cook their food by boiling; their staple food and traditional food are prepared by the process of boiling.

#### **Concluding Remark**

The ethnographic context of the tribal and ethnic communities of Northeast India thus presents a situation that can fruitfully be utilized for understanding the archaeological past of the region. The past has a continuity and that too in a condition which is very less invaded by the process of modernization and urbanization. The hilly and inaccessible tracts of the region are inhabited by myriad groups of tribal communities with distinct practices, beliefs and traditions. Many of these practices and customs have their origin in the prehistoric past. The longest and central piece of stone among a number of monoliths erected lineally, termed as alignment of Menhir in archaeology, is known as *mawkni* or uncle stone among the Khasi and is an instance where ethnographic context is juxtaposed to archaeological context. Similarly, the angular iron hoe (*gitchi* among the Garos) used widely in jhumming activities is a continued replica of the Neolithic axe with provision for hafting. The past-present continuum as it is commonly termed has some other theoretical dimensions discussed in the disciplinary boundary of ethnoarchaeology. Discussing the scope and theoretical implication of ethnoarchaeology, Stiles (1977) has elaborated that the continuous or direct historical model is applicable when ethnographic and the archaeological context are contiguous in time and space. The tribal communities and the territories inhabited by them in northeastern region of India thus offer a situation where the continuous or direct historical model of Stiles can well be applied. Already discussed ethnoarchaeological processes of megalithic tradition, pottery tradition, shifting cultivation and culinary practice are many of such examples which can well be investigated to understand the process of formation of the society and culture in this part of the country.
