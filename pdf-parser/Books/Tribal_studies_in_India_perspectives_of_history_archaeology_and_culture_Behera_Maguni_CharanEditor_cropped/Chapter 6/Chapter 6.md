**Dinesh Narayan Verma**

**Abstract** This chapter traces the present situation of vulnerability of the Paharias, a PVTG in Jharkhand to the colonial policy. It discusses how Paharias were deprived of their resources and thus marginalized consequent upon colonial policy of expansion of settled agriculture. The colonial administration facilitated settlement of the Santals as agriculturists on the lands and forest of the Paharias as a part of their project of expanding settled agriculture. They receded to the hills and confined to traditional mode of livelihood. Their exclusion continued even in the process of national development. The chapter also highlights Paharias' increasing awareness of their rights over land and other resources in the process of the present statesponsored development; and identity assertion through their demands for these rights.

## **Introduction**

The Scheduled Tribes of India constitute 8.6% (total strength: 104, 281, 034) of the total population (1, 210, 569, 573) of the country according to Census 2011 (GoI 2011) and are found settled through its length and breadth. They have been living in various ecological and geo-climatic conditions ranging from plains and forests to hills and inaccessible areas of island ecology. They are at different stages of socioeconomic and educational development. Notably, many of these tribal groups have adopted mainstream way of life, while there are some who are still very far behind in competitive life struggle of modern civilization. These groups live in vulnerable

conditions, and at present 75% of these vulnerable communities have been put in the bracket of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) on the criteria of (a) preagricultural level of technology, (b) stagnant or declining population, (c) extremely low literacy and (d) subsistence level of economy (GoI 2008–09: 24 and Verma 1990: 36). Admittedly, the PVTGs are facing different kinds of socioeconomic problems, and numerically they are on verge of gradual decline, especially Sauria Paharias, but this study only traces the vulnerability of the autochthon Paharias to historical factors of negligence and suppressive-cum-subjugating attitude of colonial officials who ruled over India for about two centuries (1757–1947). Historically, the Paharias inhabit Santal Parganas of Jharkhand and have been categorized as one of the most ancient PVTGs of India (GoJ 2002–03: 9–11).

# **Jharkhand: The Homeland of Thirty-Two Tribal Communities**

The state of Jharkhand comprises a greater portion of Chota Nagpur Plateau1 and Santal Parganas.2 After reorganization of the state, it consists of five divisions of North Chota Nagpur, South Chota Nagpur, Chaibasa (Kolhan), Palamau and Santal Parganas (Singh 2006: 280–298). It is an abode of 32 tribal groups (see for details Sharma and Kirti 2006; Sahu 2012 and Verma 2013) including 9 primitive tribes renamed as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) as specified by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (GOI 2008–09: 168–169), Government of India and Annual Report 2008–2009. These tribal groups include Asur, Banjara, Bathudi, Bedia, Binjhia, Birjia, Birhor, Baiga, Bhumij, Chero, Chik Baraik, Gond, Gorait, Ho, Karmali, Kavar, Kharia, Kharwar, Khond, Kisan, Kol, Kora, Korwa, Lohra, Mahli, Mal Paharia, Munda, Uraon, Parhaiya, Santal, Sauria Paharia and Savar, while PVTGs include Asur, Birhor, Birjia, Hill Kharia, Korwa, Mal Paharia, Parhaiya, Sauria Paharia and Savar. According to Primitive Tribal Group of Jharkhand Survey Report (2002–2003) of Jharkhand Tribal Welfare Research Institute (Ranchi), the Savar and the Hill Kharia are the two names of the same tribe; thereby actually listing eight PTGs (PVTGs) in the state (GoJ 2002–2003: 7). Out of these eight PVTGs, there are only five PVTGs settled in Santal Parganas division of the state. These include Asur, Mal Paharia, Parhaiya, Sauria Paharia and Savar (GoJ 2002–2003: 7–11). Asur and Savar are found with a less concentration in

The Indo-Gangetic Plain lies to the north and east while the Basin of Mahanadi River lies to the south of the plateau. The total area of the plateau is approximately 65,000 square kilometres ([https://en.wikipedia.org/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chota_Nagpur_Plateau) wiki/**[Chota\\_Nagpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chota_Nagpur_Plateau)**\_**Plateau**)

Dumka and Godda districts, respectively, while Mal Paharias are found concentrated in all over the division of Santal Parganas (six districts Dumka, Deoghar, Godda, Sahibganj, Pakur and Jamtara); but Sauria Paharias are concentrated in Godda, Pakur and Sahibganj districts (GoJ 2002–03: 9–11) only. They are autochthons of Santal Parganas and actively participated in freedom struggles against Britons in India (for details see Diwakar 1959: 598–599; Nath and Verma 1990, 1996; Verma 2006: 55–88; 2008: 78–116; 2001). The Survey Report (2002–2003) revealed that the Mal Paharias and the Sauria Paharias have large concentration in Dumka and Sahibganj districts, respectively. According to 1891 Census Report, there were in total 136,498 Paharias (Sauria Paharia 111,592 and Mal Paharia 24,906); but in 2002–2003 the total population of the tribe declined to 121,904 (Sauria Paharia 61,121 and Mal Paharia 60,783). According to Census 2011, the Mal Paharia increased to 1,15,093, while the population of Sauria Paharia decreased to the strength of 31,050; but the total strength of Paharias raised to 1,46,143 (see Sharma 2014: 98136).

## **Traditions**

The autochthons, the Sauria Paharias, also known as Sauria Malers, the oldest inhabitants of Santal Parganas, have no story or history of their origin, except the modern conjecture first recorded by Lt. T. Shaw (1795: 45) in 1795 and repeated by Francis Buchanan in 1811, Captain Walter Stanhope Sherwill in 1851, E.T. Dalton in 1872, W. W. Hunter in 1868 and followed by other scholars. They do not endorse the story of their common origin with the Oraons and migration with them from the west as preserved by the latter people; on the contrary they aver that the human race was first appeared on the hills to which they cling. This is their tradition as revealed by Lt. Shaw:

Seven brothers were sent from Heaven to people the earth; the eldest fell sick, whilst the remainder were preparing a great feast. It was arranged that each was to take of the food that he had prepared and go to the place he had chosen to live in. One took goat's flesh and went to a distant country, and his progeny are Hindus, another, from whom the Mussalmans are descended, took flesh of all kinds, except pork. It is not stated what the third took, but he originated the Kharwars. The fourth took hog's flesh, went north, and from him sprang the Kiratis; a fifth became the ancestor of the Kawdir (Koda Kola, meaning tank digging Kols; the sixth took food of all kinds and went far away, and it was not known what had become of him till the English appeared, when it was at once concluded that they were the descendants of the omnivorous brother. The seventh brother was named Malair, he was the oldest who was sick, they gave him all kinds of food in an old dish, thus he became an outcast, and he was left in the hills, where, finding neither clothes nor means of subsistence, he and his people necessarily became thieves, and continued in that vocation till taught better by Mr. Cleveland.3 (Dalton 1872: 272 and see Verma 2005a for details).

<sup>3</sup>Augustus Cleveland was collector of Bhagalpur (1779–1784) who tried to pacify militant Paharias by his policy of conciliation and consolidation after early British officials' Captain Robert Brooke (1772–1774) and James Browne (1774–1778) who could not check stiff resistance of the Paharias to the East India Company's rule in the region. His policy is better known as Cleveland system wherein pensions to the Paharia Sardars, Naibs and Manjhis, formation of Paharia Archers' Army

## **Migration**

'This wild legend is', as Dalton has observed:

only useful as indicating the people with whom the Malers have successfully come into contact. They recognise, and attempt to account for the existence of Kiratis, Kharwars, Kols, Hindus, Muhammadans, and the English; but none of their own cognates were known to them. The story gives us no clue to migrations; but tradition brings the whole nation gradually from the Western Ghats to Rohtas; where, it is said; they settled for a long period; till attacked and driven out by the Aryans. They divided into two parties, one selecting the Rajmahal Hills, the other, the highland of Jharkhand or Chutia Nagpur, as their place of refuge. They assign to this flight from Rohtas a comparatively recent period, making out that their conquerors were Muhammadans, but this is inconsistent with the more reliable accounts we have of the long sojourn of the Oraons in Chutia Nagpur. (Dalton 1872: 272)

In fact, Dalton while trying to establish a common relationship between the Malers and the Oraons wrote in 1872:

The Oraons have tradition when driven from Rohtas, they divided into two parties. One under the chief went north towards the Ganges and eventually occupied the Rajmahal Hills, the other under the chief's younger brother went south-east. This tradition of a separation is borne out by the evident affinity in language, and similarity in customs of the Oraons and the Rajmahalis, and though the latter do not acknowledge the relationship, their common origin may be considered as established, and as the Rajmahalis are Malas or Malavas, it may be assumed that the Oraons are Malavas too. (Dalton 1872: 251)

This view was further supported by Earnest Droese (1884) and G.A. Grierson (1906: 446–447). Droese basing his arguments on linguistic affinity of the Sauria Paharias and the Oraons opined that they were of the same origin. But, owing to their being ignorant of the Oraons, the Paharias deny the similarity of their languages and customs (Prasad 1970: 125). L.S.S. O'Malley (1910: 89 & 91) and Bradley-Birt (1905: 25) have also described them as a branch of the Dravidian race, of which the Oraons of Chota Nagpur form a section. On the basis of G.A. Grierson's (1906: 446–447) observation, McPherson (1909: 35–36) observed;

their language and customs show that they are nearly akin to the Oraons or Kurukh of the Chota Nagpur plateau, and these have traditions which carry them back to at least the beginning of the Christian era. They say they dwelt originally in the Caranatic of Southern India, that they came up the west coast of India to the mouth of Nerbudda river, whence they made their way to Central India and settled on the banks of the Sone.' Then the Aryans drove them out of Bihar and they split into two sections, one of which followed the Ganges and settled in the Rajmahal Hills, while the other keeping to the Sone settled in the north-west corner of the Chotanagpur plateau. Grierson places Kurukh and Malto nearest to Tamil and Kanarese, the Dravidian tongues spoken in south and south-west India by the aborigines with whom the traditions of the Oraons and Malers disclose that they were most closely connected. As to the comparative date of advance of the Oraons and Malers towards their present homes, McPherson pointed out to the evidence we drive from family traditions of the Nagbansi Rajas of Chotanagpur. 'The Mundas and Oraons were both settled peoples of

the Plateau before the rise of the Nagbansi family. Both took part in the inauguration and marriage ceremonies of Phani Mukuta Rai, the first Raja and it was the fifty- second in descent from Phani Mukuta Rai who was reigning when Colonel Dalton wrote in 1872. (McPherson 1909: 16)

Fifty-two generations take one back to the earlier centuries of the Christian era, and we may therefore conjecture with some approach in certainty that the Rajmahal hill men have occupied their present abode for at least 2000 years. A remarkable confirmation of this inference from tribal tradition is found in the work of Greek geographer Megasthenes who had visited the capital of Chandragupta Maurya between 302 and 288 B.C. The Malers of Rajmahal Hills are with some certainty identified with the people called Malli by Megasthenes (McPherson 1909: 16). Thus the Paharias are the earliest settlers in the division of Santal Parganas; consequently they are the original owners of the region, the sons of the soil, and the autochthons of the Santal Parganas.

#### **Tribal World of Santal Parganas**

It is to be noted that out of 32 tribes found and settled in Jharkhand, not less than 26 tribal communities inhabit the length and breadth of Santal Parganas. These include Asur, Banjara, Bathudi, Bedia, Birhor, Baiga, Bhumij, Gond, Gorait, Ho, Karmali, Kharia, Kharwar, Khond, Kisan, Kol, Kora, Korba, Mahli, Mal Paharia, Munda, Uraon, Parhaiya, Santal, Sauria Paharia and Savar. But presently the Paharias and the Santals are the two main tribes of the Santal Parganas division of Jharkhand (Vidyarthi 1963: 130). As noted above, the Paharias are the earliest settlers of the Rajmahal Hills in the division and had their estates and kingdoms in the region from prehistoric times (Oldham 1930: ix). The researches done so far in the field of social sciences and humanities have amply proved that the primitive Paharias are the earliest inhabitants of the Santal Parganas, while the tribes like Khetauris, Bhuinyas, Domes and others are next to the Paharias; but as far as the Santals are concerned, they are comparatively newcomers, dating from the end of the eighteenth or the beginning of the nineteenth century (McPherson 1909: 13). Though the division of Santal Parganas is now regarded as the nucleus of the habitat of the Santals, it is not their original home. There is no doubt, E. T. Dalton observes, that the Santals settled down in parts of the Hazaribagh Division (now in Jharkhand) and parts of Birbhum (now in West Bengal) at a very remote period; and it is chiefly by migrations from those regions that the Santals settled in the region, and after the Santal Insurrection of 1855–1856, the district of Santal Parganas (Dalton 1872: 217) (now division from 1983) was formed in 18554 (Datta 1940: 69).

<sup>4</sup>The Act 37 of 1855 formed the Santali areas into a separate non-regulation district, to be known by general designation of the Santal Parganas.

#### **Paharia Versus Santals**

In this region the Santals were noticed first in 1810–1811 by Francis Buchanan who had surveyed the region and reported the settlement of about 500 Santal families in the Dumka subdivision (Buchanan 1939: 264). About Paharias Buchanan said, 'I believe them to be the descendants of the original inhabitants of the country' (Buchanan 1939: 251). Robert Montgomery Martin also stated in his book *The History, Antiquities, Topography, and Statistics of Eastern India* that 'the mountain tribes are, I believe, the descendants of the original inhabitants of the country ...' (Martin 1838: 138). In fact the earliest inhabitants of the division are the Maler or Sauria Paharia who still inhabit the north Rajmahal Hills (Houlton 1949: 72).

There are mainly two branches of the Paharias, the Mal Paharias and the Maler or Sauria Paharias. The Mal Paharias live in the southern hills of the *Damin-i-koh* and in the hilly country in the south and east of the division, while the Sauria Paharias live in the northern Rajmahal Hills5 (Houlton 1949: 81&83 and Gopl Lal 1985). Therefore, these two branches are described by McPherson as the 'southern mountaineers' and the 'northern mountaineers', respectively, and indentified as 'the oldest aborigines' (McPherson 1909: 13). Reginald Heber (1827: 275) had also described the tribe in details in his 'narratives' which had been published in three volumes from London in 1878. After Buchanan, Sutherland, Joint Magistrate of Bhagalpur, who was especially deputed to make an investigation into the state of landed tenures of the hill people in 1818 had also noticed the presence of the Santals in various villages of *Damin-i-koh* (see Sutherland 1819 and Man 1867: 11).

After a detailed enquiry in course of which he traversed the whole of the tract, Sutherland submitted his recommendations in 1818. On the basis of his recommendations, *Damin-i-koh* was demarcated in 1833 by John Petty Ward and Captain Tanner; and in 1837 James Pontet was placed in charge of its revenue administration, being specially instructed to give the Santals, who were then pouring in, every encouragement in the work of clearing jungles (O'Malley 1910: 50 and Roy Choudhury 1965: 73). From the report of Sutherland, it is obviously clear that the Paharias are the original inhabitants of the region then known as Jungle Terai where the autochthons (the Paharias) had their estates and kingdoms from very ancient times. In this context paragraphs 80 to 90 of the report are revealing. It clearly refers to the clash for lands between the two ethnic groups and the immigration of the Santals in the region. The autochthons challenged and opposed the arrival of the Santals into the heart of their country. Their stiff and unceasing opposition to the coming of the Santals is described in detail by Robert Carstairs (1935; for detail see the first four chapters of the work) who was the Deputy Commissioner of the Santal Parganas from 1885 to 1898. Here it is to be noted that the Paharias had also unceasingly stood against foreign onslaughts on their estates and kingdoms (Umashankar

<sup>5</sup>As far as Kumarbhag Paharias are concerned, they are Hinduized section of Mal Paharias as observed by Verma during a field study (2005b). It is to be noted that *Damin-in-koh*, a Persian word meaning the skirts of the hills, was the name given to a densely forested and hilly area of Rajmahal Hills (now in the area of Sahibganj, Pakur and Godda districts of Jharkhand).

1965: 45–47 and Hunter 1975: 221) and fought with great force against the mighty Hindu, Muslim, Afghan and Mughal rulers; for they had been the people known for their undiluted nationality and freedom loving community (Carstairs 1935: 9; MacDoughall 1985: 27; and for details see Verma 2006).

Even before Sutherland, Major James Browne had given a detailed account of the tribe and described their estates and depredations, customs, manners, system of cultivation, etc. (Browne 1788: 76–91). According to Major James Browne, the entire region of the Rajmahal Hills was in possession of these mountaineers. They had cleared the jungles 'in order to build their villages' and also for cultivation6 (Browne 1788: 76; also see Verma 2016: 65–72). So the Paharias are described as 'the earliest settlers in the district' (now division) by L.S.S. O'Malley (1910: 86) and 'the men of the hills' by Robert Carstairs (1935: 1). In his notes, Captain Sherwill observed that 'The Santals are interlopers, the hill men are the original inhabitants' (Sherwill 1851).

#### **Paharias Lost Their Lands and Forests**

Thus, it is evidently clear that the Santals are not the original inhabitants of the Santal Parganas, while the Paharias have been living in the region from prehistoric times (also see Oldham 1930: 51). Historically, it was in *Damin-i-koh* where Paharias had been living in their villages for centuries. They lived mostly in hill tracts. During ancient and medieval times, the Paharias led a life undisturbed by the mighty empires reigning in the region. Not only the Mughals could not conquer the areas possibly because they failed to penetrate into deeply forested hilly tracts, but the British also failed to subjugate them completely as the militant Paharias could never be pacified by early British officials; and they also continued to resist British administration for centuries. The East India Company's officials, therefore, encouraged and assisted Santals who were then coming in the hills and forests of the region. The Paharias opposed the coming of the Santals but failed to check Santals' immigration and retired to hill tops and became completely isolated from the outside world. The colonial regime overlooked Paharias, while Santals grew in number from 3000 in 1838 to 82,795 in 1851 contained in 1473 villages (Sherwill 1851: 548). The noted historian K. S. Singh has rightly observed that '...within a few

<sup>6</sup>During ancient and medieval times, the Paharias not only resisted foreign onslaughts on their estates and its adjoining regions but also seriously took care for maintenance and preservation of their indigenous knowledge in the field of arms, ammunition, medical treatment and health as well as in cattle breeding and farming. For centuries they followed, maintained and pursued the pristine system of farming better known as Kurwa, Kurao, Kuro or Jhuming method of cultivation (shifting cultivation). This primitive practice of farming proved to be very harmful to Paharias' socio-economic life, regional environment and water resources and caused soil erosion. It was also responsible for apparent ecological imbalance, scarcity of drinking water and depletion of wild life resources of the region. So the colonial officials tried to stop it and confined it to certain hills. After independence, the government of India banned it and declared it illegal.

decades, Cleveland's Paharias were impoverished and decimated...' (Singh 1985: 10). Towards the end of the eighteenth century, as the pressure of population was keenly felt and the jungles were being cleared, the Santals moved up towards the virgin forests in and around the Rajmahal Hills. The Permanent Settlement of 1793 forced the landlords to improve productivity of the land. The Santals were increasingly used for land reclamation and improvement. The Company regime actively assisted Santals in their settlement as they were industrious and needed to reclaim the dense forested region. They preferred and liked agriculture and settled life, acquired land for the purpose and gradually became settled agriculturists. On the other hand, the autochthon Paharias became minority in their own motherland and lost most of their lands and forests as Paharias had complained about it to Captain Sherwill (1851: 589) in 1851 who was then conducting survey of the region. Moreover, after Santal Insurrection of 1855–1856 and constitution of the district of Santal Parganas, the foreign officials gave much importance to Santals and totally overlooked autochthons who disliked foreign rule and were unwilling to conversion. So the Paharias gradually lagged behind in getting education and employment and also having facilities of simple life. This directly affected their socio-economic life and led to gradual decline in their numerical strength. According to Captain Sherwill, there were only 33,780 Mal Paharias in Rajmahal Hills in 1851 (Sherwill 1851: 604) and noted in his 'Notes', 'Labour is the hill man's abhorrence, but necessity compels him to cultivate a small portion of land for his actual existence; beyond this trifling labour he never exerts himself' (quoted from McPherson 1909: 36). Thus, by their own nature and overlooking of foreign officials, the Paharias lost their position to the Santals who gradually settled and became dominant in the region. The Santals in large numbers settled as agriculturists with the help of the Company's officials and gradually acquired autochthons' lands and forests. The observations of Captain Sherwill (1851: 589), W.W. Hunter (1975: 222–223, 308– 9), F. B. Bradley-Birt (1905: 131–132 & 157–160 ), McPherson (1909: 34–36) and L.S.S. O'Malley (1910: 50–51) reveal how Paharias gradually lost their lands and forests to the interlopers and others. Therefore, the demand for Paharia land by the autochthon Paharias is fully justified7 in the historical perspective.

#### **Population Trend of the Paharias**

In addition to their declining socio-economic life, the Paharia autochthons, mainly the Sauria Paharias, also displayed an alarmingly fluctuating trend of population growth (Table 6.1). Ups and downs in their demographical account are evident from Table 6.1 which is prepared on the basis of data gathered from census reports during the period from 1872 to 2011 (GoI, various census reports).

**Table 6.1** Trend of population growth of Paharias from 1872 to 2011 (various census reports, GoI)

The Survey Report 2002–2003, entitled *Primitive Tribal Group of Jharkhand*, which was based on the survey conducted by Jharkhand Tribal Welfare Research Institute, Ministry of Welfare, Government of Jharkhand, Ranchi, records 61,121 Sauria Paharia and 60,783 Mal Paharia, which make a total of 121,904 persons. In about 1 year as compared to Census 2011, the population of Sauria Paharia has shown a decline by 800 souls.

# **Officials' Welfare Measures Failed to Improve the Socioeconomic Status of the Paharias**

It is to be noted that since 1954, state and central governments have sanctioned and implemented various kinds of welfare measures for socio-economic development of the autochthons and have spent crores of rupees, but the original inhabitants of Santal Parganas are far behind in the race (see Verma 1996, 2005a, 2009a; 2009b; Vidyarthi 1985; Upadhyay and Pandey 2003; Singh 2009; and for details also see Nath and Verma 1993) of modern civilization. They live a life of just hand to mouth and present a very deplorable socio-economic condition since it was described by F. B. Bradley-Birt (1905) in 1905. According to *Jharkhand Encyclopaedia*, the rate of literacy in Sauria Paharia and Mal Paharia is less than 1% (Pal 2008: 290 &360); it is an outcome after spending crores of rupees for the purpose of raising literacy level during a period of more than six decades. According to a report published in 2007, the state government spent seventy lakh rupees per year for education of Paharia children, and during the last decade a sum of ten crore rupees was spent for

education of Paharia children. All these efforts have produced only 50 matriculates from among Paharia students (Verma 2014 and Mishra and Verma 2014). There is no separate arrangement to enlarge their opportunity in the field of technical and diploma education and to enable them for technical jobs. Even today, most of Paharia villages suffer from lack of drinking water, means of communication, primary education, electrification, medical and health facilities, etc. Field investigation reveals that the state government never planned properly and exclusively for the Paharias to provide employment in their areas nearer to home. Moreover, the state government's decision to recruit educated Paharias in government services remained on paper as the decision is not implemented. Even after more than 72 years of independence, neither a single Paharia could be elected M.L.A. or M.P. nor nominated in Rajya Sabha; so there is no political voice to raise the centuries-old problems of the autochthons and highlight the demand of grassroots-level socio-economic development of the tribe reeling under the colonial legacy of deprivation.

#### **Demands of Paharias**

For the last few years, the Paharias have gradually organized themselves under a few Paharia leaders and have been staging *dharna/pradarshan* and taking out processions for socio-economic development as well as fulfilment of their undernoted demands:

- 1. Grassroots level suitable actions for protection of environment in their habitat.
- 2. Complete check on human trafficking.
- 3. Immediate formation of Paharia Battalion.
- 4. Honorarium to Gorhit like Pradhan.
- 5. Appointment of Paharia Chaukidar to protect Pradhan and Paharia villages.
- 6. Appointment of Paharia teachers in Paharia villages.
- 7. Arrangement of drinking water in each Paharia village.
- 8. Return of illegally taken Paharia lands to Paharias.
- 9. Compensation of damages caused by wild elephants to Paharias.
- 10. Facility and connection of electricity and roads in Paharia villages, etc.8

In addition to all these demands, the Paharias have also demanded restoration of their estates and kingdoms allegedly taken from them through fraudulence means and by force. As they claim they ruled over centuries in and around Rajmahal Hills and had their own system of rules and rulings. In this backdrop we can easily imagine that the autochthons at present are being organized and united to come out of colonial legacy of deprivation and vulnerability. Though it is not easy, it is also not impossible if they fight for their historical motherland peacefully and democratically.

#### **Gradual Decline in Sauria Paharia's Demography**

Here it is significant to note that since first Census 1872, the total demographical strength of Paharias rose to 146,143 persons; according to the Census Report of 2011, it is the highest numerical figure of Paharias during the period from 1872 to 2011, i.e. the first census and the latest census. The population of the Sauria Paharia has declined to 31,050 persons; and it is the lowest since 1872. It needs mention that the total strength of Sauria Paharia was highest in 1891 when they were 111,592 persons in total. According to numerical strength of Sauria Paharia during 1891– 2011, the tribe lost 80,542 persons of its population; it is approximately more than 70 percent decrease in the population of Sauria Paharia.9

# **Restoration of Lands and Forests to Correct Historical Injustice**

As they mainly depend on forests, forest products and land resources, deprivation of these resulted in their vulnerability and pushed them far behind in getting education, employment, socio-economic facilities and basic amenities. It is, therefore, necessary to correct the historical injustice done to the tribe during colonial period and also concede their above-noted demands with proper restoration of their illegally snatched lands and forests, thus depriving them from their sustainable livelihood options. Mr. Kalicharan Dehri (Dumka, Jharkhand) a Paharia social worker has demanded reservation of M.L.A. and M.P. seats for Paharias in Santal Parganas and has also submitted memorandum to the state and the central government in this regard. This step is indicative of peoples' response to correct historical injustice.
