**Abstract** This chapter makes a list of megalithic arts found in Manipur and highlights different art forms particularly on engravings and paintings on the megalithic structures. It draws our attention to topical variations as depicted in megalithic arts. In doing so; the paper deals with the fact that megaliths and associated rock art practices convey the idea of social structure and religious beliefs of tribes. In a descriptive style; the chapter is an attempt to merge ethnography with archaeological knowledge in a meaningful way by interpreting megalithic practices with social status of individuals. Significantly; the chapter introduces to the emerging rock art discipline in tribal studies; which is a methodological innovation for archaeology; ethnology and lifestyle studies in general.

## **Introduction**

Manipur is a small hilly state of the Northeast India and is populated by various ethnic groups. Of them, the major ethnic groups are the Meeteis/Meiteis, the Naga group of tribes and the Kuki-Chin-Mizo group of tribes. In this paper, the author makes an attempt to present the megalithic art of this state, particularly with reference to eight tribal communities, who belong to the Naga group (Devi 2015a: 643). The tribes are the Chekhesang, the Liangmai, the Mao, the Maram, the Kabui/ Rongmei/Raungmei, the Poumai, the Tangkhul and the Zeme who also belong to the Mongoloid stock. They are the indigenous and oldest communities living in this state. These tribes are known for their artistic genius as well as good craftsmanship which often reflects through megalithic arts. Till date no extensive research work on

the megalithic art of Northeast Indian states in general, and Manipur, in particular, has been done. In view of this, the present author has conducted research work in this field to highlight the different art forms on the megaliths of these eight different tribal communities, who occupied the areas in the four districts of Manipur, namely, Churachandpur, Senapati, Ukhrul and Tamenglong.

The present paper is designed to focus on different aspects of megalithic art, viz. structural, functional and ceremonial rituals; social and religious beliefs and practices connected with the engraving works; and erection and construction of megalithic monuments and different art forms, particularly the line drawing, engraving, carving and painting works made on them. The main aim of the study is to record the most significant prehistoric living tradition of the sample tribes, who have come under the influence of Christianity, with a view to understand aspects of culture of these people in prehistoric period as is interwoven with their social structure.

### **Material and Method**

The author has selected, as has been mentioned, the Chekhesang, the Liangmai, the Tangkhul, the Poumai, the Mao, the Maram, the Kabui/Rongmei/Raungmei and the Zeme inhabited areas, where varied art forms abound. These areas are located on the southern (Churachandpur district), northern (Senapati district), eastern (Ukhrul district) and western parts (Tamenglong district) of Manipur state. The megalithic arts of these areas are directly associated with the present inhabitants. Hence, the ethnoarchaeological approach is being employed while conducting the field work. The methods adopted are village survey methods with focus on observation (Fig. 10.1).

### **The Archaeological Background**

Compared with other regions of India, the prehistoric archaeology of Northeast India particularly in the field of megalithic art is still not developed because of little exploration and excavation done so far in this region. The state affair is not so encouraging in Manipur either. Systematic archaeology commenced in this state from 1967 with the discovery of stone age relics by O. K. Singh (see Singh 1997a). From 1980 onwards, continuous archaeological researches are still going on in the state.

In 1989, O. K. Singh re-explored the Tharon site; and in 1997, he published a paper entitled *Tharon: From History to Prehistory* (Singh 1997b). In the same year, he has also published *Stone Age Archaeology of Manipur* (Singh 1997a). M. ManiBabu has conducted a number of studies on archaeology of Manipur (see reference section of his paper included in this volume). L. Kunjeshori Devi has been working on the rock engravings of Manipur since the 1990s. She along with S. S.

Singh published a paper entitled *Systematic Exploration Enhances Investigations of Megalithic and Rock Art in Manipur and Mizoram* in 2013 (Devi and Singh 2013: 36–37); but there has always been some reticence about including the significance and motifs behind the different art forms of Manipur in general and the Chekhesang, the Liangmai, the Mao, the Maram, the Kabui/Rongmei/Raungmei, the Poumais, the Tangkhul and the Zeme areas in particular.

### **The Present Research**

Taking clues from the above discoveries, the present author started exploration in four districts of Manipur as mentioned. Various art forms abound in different villages of these eight tribal communities (Devi 2015b: 666–668). In March 1988, the present author explored some rock art in the form of engravings (line drawings, grooves and cup marks) at Salangthel, Churachandpur district. In March 1991, some carved out grooves and cup marks have been discovered on the megaliths planted at Willong, a Maram village in Senapati district of this state. In December 1992, some carved out statuettes have been found in Jessami area, in Ukhrul district. In January 2009, some cup marks have been found in association with a dressed menhir at Maizailung, Ukhrul district. In 2012, some megalithic art forms including paintings have also been discovered in the Mao-, Maram- and Zeme-occupied areas of Senapati district. Similarly, in the year 2015, another megalithic art along with some rock arts has been explored in the Tharon area, a Liangmai village in the Tamenglong district. Thus, from 1980 till date (2015 to be specific), various engraving works on megaliths are discovered in many Chekhesang, Kabui/Rongmei/ Ruangmei Liangmai, Mao, Maram, Poumai, Tangkhul and Zeme areas.

### **The Findings**

The author has come across different art forms of various shapes and sizes on the megaliths of these eight tribes of Manipur. Of them, mention may be made of the line drawings, carvings, engravings and paintings made on dolmens, horizontal flat stones and menhirs. Sometimes such structures are found associated with rock arts also.

The art forms abound inside the settlement areas consist of line drawings of various shapes and sizes. They are in the form of animals, heads of animals, plants, human figures, fishes, footprints, cross-marks, game patterns and other symbols representing some events. They are described here following the alphabetical order of the name of each tribe.

### **The Chekhesang Megalithic Art**

The Chekhesangs are the inhabitants of the extreme northeastern border of Manipur. They are particularly concentrated in Jessami area of Ukhrul North. It has a population of over 5000 individuals scattered in three villages of Chingai subdivision of Ukhrul district. The villages are Jessami Khunjao, Jessami Christian Compound and Soraphung. A Chekhesang village is a close-knit social unit in a contiguous territorial space. They look after the village affairs through a council of elders headed by the chief (*Mewoo*) of the village concerned. The village chief is assisted by *Chishe* (deputy village chief) and clan elders of the village in discharging his duties and responsibilities.

The Chekhesang is one of the small communities living in Manipur and belongs to the Tibeto-Burman family of the Mongoloid racial group. This community has a distinctive feature having its own dialect, social organization, religion and cultural life.

The Chekhesang (*Che-Khe-Sang*) community consists of three smaller groups, viz. the *Cheri*, the *Kheja* and the *Sangtam*. These three groups are distributed in the Phek district of Nagaland and the Chingai subdivision of Ukhrul district of Manipur. Here the *Che* represents the *Chetri* group, whereas the *Khe* and the *Sang* represent the *Kheja* and *Sangtam* groups, respectively. As a matter of fact, the Chekhesang is a transborder tribe (Devi 2014a: 398).

The Chekhesang tribe during pre-Christian days raised various megalithic structures like menhir (*Jathoja/Zathoza*, memorial stones for social status), alignment (*Jathoja/Zathoza*); avenue (*Jathoja/Zathoza* – memorial stones for social status), cairn (*Etsolakhu*, resting place/stone seats, *Ketsimkhutso* (gravestone) and small statutes (*Ariza*, representing the number of persons whom they have killed on raids). Besides, they also construct platform (*Enhu*, a cairn constructed in the form of circular or semicircular structure) in the name of a brave man (Devi 2013: 611–612). The choice of the shape and size of the *Enhu* is based on the wish of the host/donor/ donors above which they again erect small stones representing the number of women whom the brave man had won their hands during his prime life along with other carved out small stones representing the number of furious wild animals which he had caught/killed during his lifetime. Among the Chekhesangs, some carving of human figure for *Ariza* (Devi 2002a: 262) and animal figures on the commemorative stones of *Enhu* (by line drawings) are recorded so far in the category of megalithic art (Devi 2011: 66–76; 2015a: 657; 2015b: 678).

### **The Kabui/Rongmei/Ruangmei Megalithic Art**

The Kabui/Rongmei/Ruangmei is one of the largest indigenous tribes of Manipur state. The tribe is found in six districts of Manipur, viz. the Bishnupur, Imphal East, Imphal West, Tamenglong, Thoubal and Senapati districts. Their concentration is found in the Tamenglong subdivision, Nungba subdivision and Khoupum subdivision of the Tamenglong district. The tribe has a population of about 50,000 individuals distributed in 82 villages. It has four distinctive clans, viz. *Kammei*, *Gonmei*, *Gangmei* and *Longmai*. Except *Longmai,* each clan has a number of lineages. For example, the Kammei clan has seven lineages; these are *Malangmei/Marangmei*, *Marang Pongmai*, *Phaomei/Pamei*, *Kamson*, *Kamdaimei*, *Kamei* and *Lungangme*i. The *Golmei* clan has seven clans, viz. *Gonthaimei*, *Gondaimei*, *Remmei/Riamei*, *Maringmei*, *Palmei/Panmei/Paomei*, *Thaimei* and *Daimei/Dangmei*. Likewise the *Gangmei* clan has four lineages. These are the *Phegagang*, *Sidongang*, *Jukhaogang* and *Kamangang*.

Each Kabui/Rongmei/Ruangmei village is a self-ruled and self-administered unit. Its internal administration is generally carried out effectively through a number of agencies which are invariably in existence in each village of this tribe. And each village has a traditional village council, called *Pei*. It has the following functionaries:

- 1. The *Nampou-Nampei* (founder-member of the village concerned).
- 2. *Tinku/Taku* (senior most person of the village).
- 3. *Banza* (senior member of the village).
- 4. *Peithang-Peiru* (aged person of the village).

In place of the old designations, new names of the functionaries are coming up. They are as follows:

- 1. *Khunbu* (*Nampou* or owner of the village).
- 2. *Khullak* (administrator of the village).
- 3. *Luplak* (controller of the village).
- 4. *Mantri* (minister).
- 5. *Meitei Lambu* (one who communicates the Meiteis) (Devi 2002–2003: 43).

This tribe erected different megalithic structures after performing five series of feasts-of-merit, viz. *Bamzou*, *Mulengdai*, *Taokhon*, *Ban-ru* and *Kaisumi* (Devi 2002–2003: 117–124; 2011: 78–96). Various megalithic structures distributed in Kabui−/Rongmei-/Ruangmei-occupied areas are miniature menhir (*Kaiba* and *Kaibi Bhamboo/Soang* – village deity), small cairn (*Taokhon/Thel* – commemorative structure raised by the descendents for their loving forefathers after performing the *Taokhon* feasting), a cairn associated with menhir and dolmen (*Bamdon*, memorial stone structure) (Devi 2002–2003: 124–125; 2011: 88–89), horizontal flat stones (*Dungbang*) for stone seats (Devi 2011: 95–96) and menhirs (*Taobouh* – memorial stone and also village boundary stone) (Devi 2011: 94–95). Of these megalithic structures, line drawings (footprint, animal figure, counting symbol, female genital organ, game pattern, etc.) and groovings (cup marks) are presented on the horizontal flat stones and monolithic structures. The significance of these art forms is manifold. Some of them are related to fertility, e.g. female genital organs and sign of copulation; some are related to head-hunting, e.g. deep grooves with channel; some are related to their social system, e.g. footprint, counting system, animal figure, etc.

### **The Liangmai Megalithic Art**

The Liangmai is another large indigenous tribe of Manipur. The tribe is mainly concentrated in the Nungba and Tamei subdivisions of Tamenglong district and the Mao-Maram, Saitu-Gamphazol and Sadar Hills West subdivisions of Senapati district. It has a population of about 25,205 individuals and distributed in 45 villages. Scattered pockets are also found in the Imphal East and Imphal West districts. They speak Liangmai dialect (Devi 2001: 23).

This tribe has two patrilineal clans called *Newmai* and *Pamai*. Each clan has 12 lineages.

*Newmai* clan: *Abonmei*, *Daimai*, *Dirinamai*, *Disongpunamai*, *Moitamai*, *Ngomai*, *Ngunamai*, *Penmai*, *Ringkunamai*, *Thiumai*, *Thiupuongtamai* and *Ziungnamai*.

*Pamai* clan*: Boijunamai*, *Bonmai*, *Charengnamai*, *Ginpuinamai*, *Hengmai*, *Khapuinamai*, *Langmai*, *Makhomai*, *Malangmai*, *Mariangmai*, *Renchang* and *Renta*.

Each Liangmai village has a traditional village court/council called *Apai*, which is headed by *Chawang* (chief of the village concerned). He administers the village with his *Apaimai* (councillors). He serves as religious and secular head of the village. The hearing of any case is held at his residence, which serves as the village court; and his decision is final. The *Apai* has its own system of preserving their tradition, maintaining law and order, administering justice and defending the village. In addition to *Apai*, there is also a modern system of village administration, called village authority, where *Chawang* is the ex officio chairman. The main function of village authority is to maintain law and order in the village and to review all the developmental works and reports of the Block Development Committee. It is run by the elected members of the village concerned (Devi 2001: 153–156).

This tribe has a number of megaliths. Most of them are menhirs. These are *Chengku Tusom*, stones for the rich man erected in his name who can give a feastof-merit called *Chenku*; the *Kaho Katanmei Saimingbao*, the stone for the bravest and richest person but raised during the lifetime of the performer; the *Kasaibao/Tasaibao Tusom*, menhir associated with some horizontal slabs erected in memory of distinguished deceased person (Devi 2006: 125–128); the *Atukra*, a dolmen associated with a menhir function as oath taking stone, which is regarded as God or Holy stone and is a raised platform with an upright stone; *Maning Taoba Tusom*, stone seats with a miniature menhir; stone circle (*Kapet Bam*, burial place with pit for decapitated heads of animals and human beings); capstone/stone seats (*Taideli Atu/Taikulana Ranii*, grave stone raised in memory of a loving deceased person along with sitting flat stones); and cairn (*Tabaolong/Tazan Tatbo Tusom*, a heap of stone used as watch tower). Each megalithic structure is raised by this tribe with a series of feast-of-merit, which is accompanied by many rites and rituals (Devi 2011: 112–121; 2012: 94–95). For example, the *Chenku Tusom* is raised after performing the *Chenku* feast-of-merit.

A feast-of-merit is a grand feasting. It is always accompanied by the worshipping of God and Goddesses through various rites and rituals. Of these megalithic structures, they perform megalithic art on the menhirs and table stones of dolmens only. The art form includes line drawings depicting the animals that they have slaughtered during the feast-of-merit; the human figure represents the host(s) of the grand feasting and raised the megalith in his/their name(s); different rectangular structures, spears, billhooks, baskets, etc. represent the number of clothes, paddy fields and

household implements whatever donated by the host during the megalithic raising ceremony and cross-marks. After performing such ceremony and raising a megalith, the host attains a high social status. He is allowed to use a titled cloth. Besides, the merit-seeker and members of his family are honoured by all; and such respect continues up to the grandsons and granddaughters of the family concerned who are also allowed to use the titled cloth as their parents or grandparents did (Devi 2011: 110– 131 & 2015a: 647).

### **The Mao Megalithic Art**

The Mao/Ememai/ Memai tribe of Manipur occupies the northern part of Senapati district of this state, particularly the Mao-Maram subdivision. The main industry of this community is agriculture. Some of the educated individuals are engaged in different government departments and in nongovernmental organizations. There are many educated but self-employed persons too. This tribe is also one of the indigenous tribes of this state. It is also one of the largest tribes of Manipur. It has a population of about 113,032 souls distributed in 51 villages.

Different megalithic structures are distributed in every Mao village. For erecting a megalith, the host performs 14 series of feast-of-merit, namely, *Orakaso*, *Novu/Novu Kovu*, *Omo Koju/Omo Kozu*, *Yoso/Zhoso/Ozhokoso*, *Yoshu/Zhoshu*, *Yoso Tukhu/Otdo Kodu*, *Ochizo/Ochuzo Koso*, *Thoyo/Otho Koshu*, *Tohu/Tuho*, *Ebvu Koho/Obvu Kopfo*, *Omoshiva*, *Pittoshiva*, *Shikhosiva* and *Oki Makitu/ Okitu*; generally a megalith is named after the name of the feast. Different megaliths erected after performing at least four series of grand feasting are menhir (*Zhosotu* – memorial stone/menhir of social status), alignment/avenue (*Zhoso Tukhubvu* – memorial stones/menhirs of social status), raised platform (*Kathi Mara Tukhu* –memorial stone), raised enclosure with holy stone and stone seats (*Yoso Tukhu* – public meeting and resting place) and dolmen (*Okimaki/Okimakitu/Okitu* – a commemorative stone for peace negotiation). Of all these types of megaliths, engraving and painting works are done on the menhirs only (Devi 2011: 131–143).

### **The Maram Megalithic Art**

The Maram is one of the largest primitive tribes of Manipur. The Maram people have occupied the north and northwestern part of the Senapati district; but they have their concentration in the Mao-Maram subdivision (Tadubi block). Scattered pockets are also found in the Sadar Hills subdivision (Kangpokpi Block) of the same district. The total number of present Maram villages is recorded 32 under 3 circles, namely, (i) the Maram Khullen circle, (ii) the Willong circle, and (iii) the Senapati circle. The area inhabited by this tribe lies in between 24°0′ N and 24°3′N latitudes and 93°15′E and 94°0′E longitudes.

Every Maram village is governed by the traditional village council along with modern institution of village authority. The traditional village council is headed by *Sagong –* the chief of the village. He is assisted by a number of *Kapras* (councillors). A *Kapra* is a representative of his clan in the village concerned. The selection of the *Kapra* is based on the seniority; the senior most male member of the clan is selected as its Kapra. The *Kapras* thus selected are equally important and expected to discharge their respective duties in the village administration. It needs to be pointed out here that the Maram political organization is quite democratic, and these village officials discharge their duties largely at the pleasure of the people that they govern.

The functions of traditional village council are broadly executive, administrative, and judicial. The councillors are the real body in whom the highest authority of the village concerned is vested. Undoubtedly, the Kapras are at the helms of affairs of the village. They use to formulate the policy of the village at the time of both war and peace. They use to amend the unwritten laws which are then rigidly followed. Unlike other tribes, the Marams have only one supreme ruler of all the 32 Maram villages. He is their king. Each village follows the rules whatever amended by him. In other words, the Marams have a system of governance both at tribe level and at the level of each village.

Various megaliths found in Maram villages can broadly be divided into eight structural types. They are *Beitung* (a menhir associated with dolmen, which functions as witness stone), *Ranii Atu* (a cairn used as watch tower or resting place), *Tiisum* (an upright memorial stone), *Arou Atu* (a dolmen with/without raised structure used as the grave stone), *Tiirosum* (a large horizontal flat stone, which rests on the ground directly or on some supporting stones and is used as stone seat) (Devi 2004: 70–72) and *Amailui* (an avenue formed by a cluster of miniature menhirs, erected to represent all the male members of the village in 1906) *Atuchaga Kamatei* (monolith, a holy stone) and *Atu amei ogija Phuigung Khei Karanijangba Atuwai Khei bamle* (capstone or hoodstone, a capstone for the pit where the decapitated head were buried).

In the year 1906, a natural calamity occurred in the original village; the villagers decided to shift to other locations in different groups. One of the sections selected is Sangkhungme area where the present village stands. When they selected the area for establishing their new village, the elders of the original village warned them not to shift to the selected site. It was feared that the male population, if the village was set up in the selected site, would decrease. So each male member wishing to shift down to the new location in 1906 erected a miniature menhir representing the self to confirm whether male members increased or decreased over time (Devi 2011: 157–158; 2000–2001: 120–121). The other types are *Atu chaga kamatei* (a single stone, treated as holy stone) and *Atu amei ogija phuigung khei karanijangba atuwai khei bamle* (a capstone/a flat stone covering a burial pit where decapitated heads are buried) (Devi 2004: 72–73).

Megalithic art in the form of grooving, line drawing, carving, and painting, as has been noted in the context of other tribes, is found on the menhir only. For instance, the grooves are meant to measure the height of the Maram lads/boys; and as such, the grooves are of different heights. The lesser height groove is meant for the height of young boys. Those young boys who do not attain the height of the groove are not allowed to become the cowboy of the village concerned. The groove of the greater height is meant for measuring the height of the village youths to decide their marriageable age; i.e. a youth is not allowed to marry before attaining the height of the particular groove (Devi 2011: 149–152).

### **The Poumai Megalithic Art**

The Poumai is also a large indigenous tribe in Manipur. Megalithic monuments were used to be erected traditionally in each village throughout the Poumai areas in Senapati district. It is still in practice among the non-Christian Poumais. Each megalithic erection is associated with a series of feastings. And each feasting ceremony takes at least 3 years or more to acquire the necessary items. On enquiry, it was informed that any wealthy Poumai can raise any megalithic structure after performing a series of five great feastings called *Rasou*, *Vaove*, *Moujii*, *Zhousu* and *Chiveisou*. A time interval of 3 years facilitates collection of paddy for brewing rice beer; domestication of animals like fowls, pig, cow/ox and buffaloes (to ensure that they are fully grown to suitable size); and accumulation of wealth to defray the cost (Devi 2011: 170–179; 2015a: 669–678).

In each Poumai village, there are 12 structural types of megaliths. They are *Zaosochu/Zhaosochu/Zhusochu* (menhir of social status), *Chukho* (a cairn, the village foundation stone and also public resting place), *Paohon Chukho* (clan's stone seats associated with dolmen), *Raikhubu* (dolmen of highest social status), *Seibechu* (religious flat stone), *Chadeichu* (a judiciary stone), *Neisha Chukho* (religious stone), *Tapu* (a monolith for placing the decapitated head/heads), *Chuchukho* (a stone circle, related to head-hunting), *Khophochu* (capstone for the grave) (ASI 2004: 118–119), *Loupfo* (an alignment of small stones; each stone represents a girl/ woman, whose hand was won by a brave man) and *Aro Adu* (village gate and wall). Out of these 12 megalithic structures, the menhirs, dolmens, village gates and walls are decorated with different art forms including paintings. The raising of megaliths and works of engravings shows that the performer attains a higher social status. Besides, some of the carving works show that the people are/were head-hunters, good warriors and hunters as well (Devi 2011: 170–179).

### **The Tangkhul Megalithic Art**

The Tangkhul is also an indigenous large tribe in Manipur. Tangkhul people are mainly distributed in the length and breadth of Ukhrul district, though some villages are situated in Senapati and Chandel districts. It has a population of about 137,171 individuals distributed in 165 villages in Ukhrul district, 20 villages in Senapati district and 3 villages in Chandel district (Devi 2008: 11–29).

In the past, the Tangkhuls were war-loving people. They were famous headhunters. Till today, there are many human skulls preserved in the office of the village council (*Hangva*), headed by the village chief (*Awunga*). The head of each clan is called *Pipa*. The nature or process of selection of the member of the traditional village council is similar to that of Liangmai as stated earlier (Devi 2008: 132).

They perform *Maran Kasa*, a feast-of-merit and erect either forked-wooden posts or huge upright stones known as *Maran Tarung* (forked post/y-post) and *Maran Lung* (menhir) or both. Besides, they construct village foundation stone: *Rihai Lung* (small cairn associated with menhir/menhirs), *Lungchan Lung* (menhir memorial stone for the deceased elder person), *Wonra/Onra* (menhir or forked post or both on a raised platform as memorial stone1 for the deceased son or daughter), *Langki/Lankan* (small cairn with two wooden posts used for resting place or dwelling places of the two deities, which are considered as the protector of the village), *Tarong* (stone seats on raised platform/wooden seats) and *Akhen* (painted wooden planks – commemorative for *Yuding* feast-of-merit) (Devi 2014b: 74–76). Of these structures, megalithic art are seen on the menhirs and flat horizontal stones. There are different motifs of art on these flat stones. Some of them are engraved with plant/animal figures, some with single or double or multiple foot prints, some with cup marks and some with game patterns while others with geometric figures and other symbols.

### **The Zeme Megalithic Art**

The Zeme tribe is an indigenous tribe of this state occupying the northernmost part of Senapati district and western part of Tamenglong district. It has a population of about 10,000 individuals distributed in 21 villages of Tousem subdivision of Tamenglong district (Devi 2001: 26). This tribe has similar social structure resembling that of the Liangmai tribe (Devi 2001: 153–156).

The megalithic structures distributed in Zeme areas are menhir, alignment, cairn and dolmens. Megalithic art is confined to the table stones of dolmen only. The art form is also the only one game pattern, which is different from the game patterns of other neighbouring tribes.

### **Result and Discussion**

In Manipur, the author has explored varied forms of megalithic and rock arts. Most of these arts are found on the megaliths. Some of them are line drawings, while others are carvings, engravings and paintings. The line drawings represent female genital organ, sign of copulation, footprint, geometrical figures, game pattern, etc.

<sup>1</sup>The memorial stone/structure for the untimely death of kid or unmarried boy or girl are different from that of the married or aged person; hence different names are given to them.

(Devi 2011: 89–95). The carving and engraving works include plants, animals, anthropomorphic figures, cup marks, footprints, spears, stars, human figures and figurines, decapitated heads (on wooden planks and stone blocks), etc. The paintings consist of plants, fishes, birds and animal motifs including human beings. Such engravings and paintings are associated in many cases with inscriptions. All the inscriptions are in their own dialect written in Roman script or in English language used by the Christian converts. These inscriptions belong to the historical period after the introduction of modern education. Till date, any of the tribes mentioned in this paper does not have its own script. Regarding the dialect of each tribe, it belongs to the Tibeto-Burman group of the Sino-Tibetan language family except the Kabui/ Rongmei/Raungmei tribe's dialect, which belongs to the Kuki-Chin subsection of the Kuki-Naga subgroup.

On inquiry being made for these megalithic arts, it was informed that some engravings are associated with memorials and commemoratives, some with headhunting, whereas some are used to measure the height of small lads of a particular village to confirm the affordable height of village cowboy; some are used to measure the height of village youths particularly the unmarried boys to fix their marriageable age; some are related to fertility; some are related to the religious ground, while few of them are related to different games. In some villages, such engravings and paintings on rocks are now replaced by huge carved out wooden planks; but paintings are continuing till date.

In Liangmai society, the author has come across various types of megaliths. Of them, menhir, chromlech, cairn, dolmen and capstone are predominant structures. In Tharon area, the most dominated megalithic types are menhir and dolmen. Almost all the menhirs in Tharon area are engraved with different figures. Most of the table stones are engraved with single or multiple figures. Earlier researchers did not mention about the art forms present on the dolmens. Beside the various art forms abound on megalithic structures, there are many forms of arts on the rocks of streambeds**.**

The main art forms that exist on menhirs are animal and human figures in their full size, traditional clothes (upper garments), baskets, *jhum* fields, instruments, winnowing plate and counting symbols, whereas the skulls of buffalo with horns, footprints, geometrical figures (rectangular, square, circular, semicircular and triangular shapes), game patterns, long and short straight lines and counting symbols are on the table stones of the low dolmens.

The carved heads on megaliths in Indonesia and on wooden planks in Manipur are not ornamental. The carved animal heads are the commemoratives of animals sacrificed during the feasts-of-merit. Thus, their value is not only aesthetic but definitely symbolic. It may be ascribed as the symbolical character to the art of the early megalithic culture of Southeast Asia. The idea associated with megalithic rituals for gaining prosperity and prestige for the living and also for establishing links with the souls of the deceased persons is similar with the megalithic cultures of Indonesia which suggest a unity of the megalithic complex extending from Northeast India to Southeast Asia (see Heekeren 1957 and Loofs 1967).

The social life in both regions is dominated by the megalithic tradition and the necessary feastings, ceremonies and rituals involved by them. Of them, the most common factor in both areas is the feast-of-merit and carving of buffalo's horn. Above all, the Poumais practise the erection of small alignments of small stones for those brave individuals who had committed sin2 during their prime lifetime (Devi 2002b).

The significance of megalithic art is to attain a high social status of the performer. The entire materials offered during the feast-of-merit performed by a meritseeker to raise a megalith are displayed on the menhir itself. The motif behind the inclusion of human figure is the representation of the merit-seeker. Sometimes, two human figures are also drawn if the merit-seeker wishes to include his spouse. The performers display the actual number of animals sacrificed; number of clothes, paddy field, weapons and implements donated; the number of baskets of paddy; and the number of flesh/meat distributed during the feast-of-merit. If the numbers of items are more than the achievements of the merit-seeker to be represented, the villagers reject them and delete the excess items. Thus, all the engraving works of menhirs are performed by respective merit-seekers to show their actual achievements made during their lifetimes.

On the other hand, the engraving works on the table stones of the low dolmens are performed by the member of the youths' dormitory of the hamlet concerned. As reported by my interpreters and informants Mr. Sangjuannong Daimai (Secretary, Art and Culture, Tharon Students' Union), Mr. Pouduanlung Moita (President, Tharon Students' Union) and Mr. Kaikhamang Daimai (Former Joint Director, Tribal Research Institute), in the olden days, the members of youths' dormitories used to perform in *Matui* festival to mark their common achievements.

After organizing such festivals, they used to perform engraving works either on the low dolmens or on the rocks of *Phiyanggo/Fianggu* streambed to commemorate the festival as well as to show their activities and also their dormitories' properties. For instance, the two straight lines on the flat stones of dolmens of *Kabonkhana/Kabonki* dormitory indicate the capable distance for long jump events, made by two good athletes. The skull of the buffalo displays the size of the animal sacrificed during the *Matui* festival, and the counting symbol on another table stone represents the number of flesh/meat distributed to all the members of *Apai* (*Apaimai)* and members of *Singku* known as *Singkumai* of the village concerned.3 It is also mentioned earlier.

<sup>2</sup>Sin contradicts his quality of bravery; the individual/brave man may be a good hunter or worrier or administrator or both but committed incest, which is considered to be a sin in the society, and hence erects the small stones representing the girls/women he had won their hands. It indicates that though the individual is an outstanding person, he is again a sinner if he couldn't perform the rituals and raised small alignments to be free from that sin (Devi, 2002a).

<sup>3</sup>The term *Apai* is the traditional village council of the Liangmai tribe; and *Apaima*i refers to their councillors; similarly, the *Singku* is the traditional village council, and *Singkumai* refers to their councillors of the Zeme tribe.

### **Conclusion**

In Manipur, the author has explored varied forms of megalithic art. Some of them are line drawings, while others are carvings, engravings and paintings. The line drawings represent female genital organ, sign of copulation, footprint, game pattern, etc. The carving and engraving works include animal and anthropomorphic figures, footprints, cup marks, spears, stars, human figurines, decapitated heads (on wooden planks), etc. The paintings consist of plant, bird and animal motifs including human beings. Such engravings and paintings are associated in many cases with inscriptions.

During field study, the author has come to know that some engravings are associated with memorials and commemoratives and some with head-hunting, some are used to measure the height of village youths particularly the unmarried boys to fix their marriageable height, some are related to fertility and some are related to the religious ground, while few of them are related to different games. In some villages, such engravings and paintings on megaliths are now replaced by huge carved wooden planks.

The aesthetic sense of the megalithic builders of Manipur is reflected in their megalithic arts, rock carvings and engravings, line drawings and paintings. Such art forms are found in the Chekhesang area of Jessami, Liangmai areas of Senapati and Tamenglong districts, Mao and Maram areas of Senapati district, Ruangmei/ Rongmei or Kabui areas in Churachandpur and Tamenglong districts, Tangkhul areas in Ukhrul district and Zeme areas in Tamenglong and Senapati districts. These different sites have various art forms which need a thorough exploration, excavation and analysis to come to a definite conclusion on megalithic arts of this region.
