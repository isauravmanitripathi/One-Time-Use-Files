**Abstract** This chapter makes a list of few rock art sites found in Odisha, and thus explores the creative genius of the early human. In itself the arts are significant in that they express knowledge, beliefs and practices of our early ancestors. But the significance of the chapter lies in the fact that it has made an attempt to explore the perception of local people, tribal and non-tribal, about these rock arts and to study the influence of rock art sites on their contemporary life including their concepts of beliefs and practices. In doing so, the chapter examines change and continuity of art forms and associated beliefs from prehistoric times. It is a methodological innovation in the study of tribal culture as a process of acculturation and assimilation with reference to the past.

## **Introduction**

Odisha is well known for its rich cultural heritage, both archaeological and natural. The state is very rich in prehistoric art heritage which found its place in the prehistoric art map of India in 1933 when K.P. Jayaswal (1933) reported one of the earliest evidences of prehistoric rock art in India from the rock shelter of Vikramkhol in the former Sambalpur district (now in the present Jharsuguda district), Odisha. These arts are in fact records of the creative genius of the early man. Which give us firsthand visual evidences about our ancestors' creativity and reflect on the past culture and environment in general. Numbers of such resourceful rock art sites of prehistoric times are reported across the state and their affiliation and beliefs among the locals inhabited around in the present day. Different types of symbols consisting of

human figurine, flora, fauna and geometric designs are either painted or engraved in these shelters by our prehistoric denizens.

During the research of the prehistoric rock art sites, the author noticed similar kinds of art tradition still existing among the tribal and non-tribal folks living in nearby area. During festive occasions, the tribal and non-tribal folks draw paintings on the wall of their houses very similar to the rock art (Fig. 11.1). Not only local people keep the tradition of rock arts alive, but they venerate to the gods and goddesses of the rock art sites and worship them in different festive occasions. Undeniably, few shelters have very strong sociocultural and religious bonds. It was reported during field study that the local people living in the vicinity of rock site believe the symbols painted on the rock shelters as works of their remote ancestors, deities, spirits, etc., and hence they worship these symbols during different festive occasions.

In this paper therefore an attempt has also been made to show the significance of these rock arts in the life of the locals including their concepts of beliefs and practices relating to a selected prehistoric rock art sites.

## **Rock Art and Rock Art Sites in Odisha**

Rock art in Odisha like that of India has a considerable antiquity. Local people living in the vicinity of the rock art sites don't claim their authorship for the works of art in the rock shelters, nor do they claim the authorship of their ancestors within their living memory. Rather they consider them as the works of heavenly bodies like the *Yakshas* or ghosts/spirits. Undoubtedly, the locals have a strong religious belief in them towards these prehistoric rock art sites.

The rock art sites are massive semipermanent and cumulative records and direct evidences which show the evolution of human from the prehuman stage as well as the emergence of complex social systems in human history. The arts constitute the greatest body of creativity of our ancestors. The antiquity of these rock arts range from the prehistoric to the historic periods; this is reported by various scholars at different time periods. There are about 110 rock shelters which have been documented so far from the state. These rock art sites are mainly documented from the districts of Bargarh, Cuttack, Jharsuguda, Kalahandi, Keonjhar, Khurda, Mayurbhanj, Nuapara, Sambalpur, Sundargarh and Suvarnapur by scholars (see Jayaswal 1933; Chakravarti 1936; Singh Deo 1976; Behera 1992; Neumayer 1993; Pradhan 2001; Garnayak 2008a). The highest concentration of rock art sites in the state are reported from Western Odisha in general and Sambalpur and Sundargarh districts, in particular.

Rock art is a term commonly used for the designs and other intentional marks that people made in the past on natural geological surfaces of boulders, cave walls, rock shelter walls and ceilings. It is broadly divided into two categories: (a) the pictographs or the applied art and (b) the *petroglyphs* or the extractive art. Pictographs are produced by adding pigment to the rock surface. The pigments are mostly derived from a variety of minerals of different hues. However; the favoured colour is ochre drawn from hematite. Ochre is found in a wide range of colours: yellow, orange, brown and red. White drawn from lime is another colour frequently used in polychromatic as well as monochromatic paintings. Pictographs are also known as rock paintings, whereas *petroglyphs* are created by removing some substance from the rock surface by hammering, chiselling, abrading, engraving or scooping the rock surface.

The subject matter of rock art motifs and symbols arrayed in the rock art of Odisha can be classified into animate which include antler, deer, boar, monkey, giraffe, humped cattle, lizard, fogs, fish, tortoises, human forms, human palm and foot mark, vulva (female genital organ), animal foot (paws), birds, butterfly, phytomorphs, floral motif, serpentine, cobra hoods, and the inanimate motifs which include a host of parallel vertical or horizontal lines or wavy lines within or without a geometric format: criss-cross, zigzags, grids, curvy linears, honeycombs, harpoons, denticulate, diamond chains, spirals, concentric circles, series of dots, cupules, cup mark, anchor motif, broom pattern, dots, rain motifs, rectilinear pattern, rhombic pattern, concentric circles, triangle, oval, oval shape carpet, razor blade pattern, intricate pattern, wavy line, lunate shape motif, roman and Brahmi

alphabetic forms, wheel, brackets zigzag, pear shape, shield, moon shape, harpoon rhombic patterns, saw pattern and star shapes and many others. The varieties are so bewildering that no definite name or meaning can be given to these forms.

Most of the rock arts are executed either on natural geological surfaces of boulders or cave walls and ceilings. Its antiquity ranges from the prehistoric to the historic period and is an important evidence of human creativity through the vicissitudes of time and space. The artists or painters of our ancient past, who were mainly responsible for these paintings, might not have given any name to these rock art sites; but it is only the local inhabitants of the contemporary times who gave a specific name to a particular rock art site for easy recognition. Most of the prehistoric rock art sites bear similar kind of symbols. Since the people of the region named these shelters on the basis of these symbols, many rock art sites possess a common type of name. For example, *Lekhamoda* (*lekha* = writing and *moda* = shelter; *moda* is a corrupt pronunciation of *madua*, meaning shelter), meaning rock shelter with writing; *Ushakuthi* (*Usha* = worship or ritual and *kuthi* = hall or chamber), meaning worship hall or ritual chamber; *Ushakupa* (*Usha* = ritual *and kupa* = cavity*)*, meaning ritual cavity; Lekhapathar (*Lekha* = writing and *pathar* = stone), meaning stone that has got writing; and *Pandava Bakhara* (Pandava = the epic heroes and bakhara = room/chamber) are named to number of rock art sites. *Lekhamoda* and *Ushakuthi* are the two popular generic names applied to the rock art shelters irrespective of their locations and subject matter of depiction. As mentioned earlier, sometimes more than two rock art sites possess a single name. For example, *Ushakuthi* and *Lekhamoda* are two common names used for more than one rock art sites. In such cases, the local people prefix either the name of the hill, mountain or village where the rock art site is located for easy identification of locality or particular rock art site. *Deulluga Ushakuthi* and *Ulapgarh Ushakuthi* are two names of such types of rock art sites where the name *Deulluga* and *Ulapgarh* are prefixed to the generic name *Ushakuthi*. Similarly, sometimes the name of the Reserved Forests, where a particular rock art site is located, is also prefixed to the rock shelters. For example, Rajbahal in Sundargarh district is a reserved forest, and the rock shelter in it is named as *Rajbahal Ushakuthi.* Similarly, *Vikramkhol Ushakuthi* is the name of the rock art shelter situated in the reserve forest of Vikramkhol in Jharsuguda. Besides, often these rock art sites are related to the Hindu mythology and named after the epic personalities like Rama, Bhima and Sita, and it is believed that they stayed in these shelters during their exile. On the basis of these epic personalities, these rock shelters are named as Bhimamandali, Sitakund, Pandava Bakhara, etc. Apart from this, the local people associate these rock shelters with their religion. To them, the works of art in the shelters are the works of the heavenly bodies or that of the spirits. They even often consider it a taboo to touch such works of art, which probably acted as blessings in disguise for the antique art from spoiling and disfigurement by human vandalism (Pradhan 2001). Human vandalism is the major threats to these rock art sites. The rock shelters of Manikmoda, Vikramkhol and Ulap can be cited as examples where the prehistoric rock paintings are disfigured by the picnickers and tourists. It can be safely inferred that the link of these prehistoric

rock paintings by the locals with their religious beliefs and faiths has been useful to protect them from destruction resulting from major onslaught of human vandalism.

It is a usual practice with the non-tribals and tribals living in the plains to decorate and beautify their places of worship with a great variety of *alpanas* or colourful designs drawn mostly in red, white and yellow. During harvesting, the non-tribal and tribal cultivators decorate the floors and walls of their houses and granaries with different designs like those in rock art shelters, which they make out of the pulverized paste of rice. Similarly, painting the wall and floor of the houses is a daily ritual among the Sauras (see Elwin 1951 and Mahapatra 1991), one of the Particularly Venerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) of Odisha. Copying of the arts in houses and on festive occasions point to the beliefs they have about the rock art. Because of this belief, it is quite natural for the local people to attribute these works of art in the rock shelters to some kind of ritualistic significance of the past, or of the heavenly and semi-heavenly bodies, as they believe and call them as *Ushakuthi* or *Ushakupa* (Pradhan 2001).

## **Beliefs and Practices Related to the Rock Art Sites**

The rock art sites of Rajbahal Ushakuthi, Sitaghara, Debrigarh Ushakuthi, Pakhanapathar/Lekhapathar, Chhatagarh shelter, Bhimamandali, Pandava Bakhara, Deulluga Ushakuthi, Khandataruali, Pujadunguri, Jogimath, etc. are some of the important rock art sites of Odisha having religious importance where the local people still worship during various festive occasions as well as other specific occasions. A brief description of these rock art sites are given below:

### *Rajbahal Ushakuthi (Latitude: 22° 12*′ *50*″ *N and Longitude: 83° 39*′ *30*″*E)*

The Rajbahal Ushakuthi group of rock shelters is located in the reserve forest of Ushakuthi near village Rajbahal in Lephripara tehsil of Sundargarh district. This site is infested with snakes and the overhanging roofs of the shelters look like snake hoods from a distance. No doubt, this group of rock shelters is also called as *Sarafgarh* or *Sarpagarh*, meaning the den of the snakes. The Ramayana epic is very popular among the locals, both tribals and non-tribals alike in the region. The local people associate these shelters with the epic hero Rama. It is believed that he lived in these shelters with his wife Sita and brother Laxmana during their exile. Because of this and incidents related to their exile, the shelters are named as Sitakund, Risikund, Sarafgumpha and Laxmanpa.

Recently in 2005, a Siva temple has been constructed on the top of one shelter, and Lord Siva is being worshipped by the locals. A Sadhu is staying in this shelter who is regularly applying vermilion, ghee and rock powder paste upon the engraved panel. One foot mark in the shelter is considered to be the foot of the epic hero Laxmana. The groove of the foot is now concealed under a paste of rock powder and vermilion applied by the Sadhu and the local people. During the survey of the locality, it was found that one rock art motif (Broom pattern) executed at random over the entire shelter wall found depicted in the house walls of the locality during festive occasions. A huge gathering of local people is held during Maha Shivaratri when people from nearby villages come to the site for worship, and as a result, the lonely and thickly forested site becomes over crowded.

#### *Sitaghara (Latitude: 21° 30*′ *80*″ *N and Longitude: 85° 46*′ *22*″*E)*

The rock shelter of Sitaghara (near Ravan Chhaia) in village Danguaposhi in Ghatagaon tehsil of Keonjhar district is significant among the local communities, particularly the tribes like the Gond and the Sabar for its association with Sita of Ramayana. Besides, some other beliefs relating to the fertility and fecundity are associated with the site (Garnayak 2008a).

The hillocks are considered to be the abode of Devi Sita, who as is believed conceived Lava and Kusha in this shelter during her banishment. Since this shelter is related to fertility and fecundity, the local barren women irrespective of any caste or community affiliation worship beneath the rock shelter near a rectangular shrine made of mud walls on every Thursday with the hope of getting a child (Fig. 11.2). Within the shrine there are three stones representing Sita and her twin sons Laba and Kusha which are held with great veneration. On Thursday as a part of the ritual during worship, a woman has to lift a block of stone up to her abdomen and move around the shrine through a narrow passage. It is believed that she will conceive and eventually become pregnant if she is able to pass through that narrow passage along with that block of stone. Terracotta horses are offered to that deity after fulfilment of worshippers' desire as well as for the wellbeing of children.

#### *Debrigarh Ushakuthi (Latitude: 21° 33*′ *82*″ *N and Longitude: 83° 35*′ *22*″*E)*

The Debrigarh Ushakuthi rock shelter is situated in Bhatli tehsil of Bargarh district. There are a number of palm prints present on the wall of rock shelter. This site is believed to be the abode of Maa Mangala/Durga by the locals living in the vicinity,

and the palm impressions are considered the symbolic representation of the goddess Mangala. They worship the goddess twice in a year in this shelter, first in the month of Chaitra (March–April) and second at the time of Dussehra (September–October). By worshipping the goddess twice in a year, they seek the blessings of the goddess for their wellbeing and safety during their various activities in the forest. The worship is attested by the evidence of vermilion (*sindur*) applied on the rock canvas below the palm motif and half burn incense sticks in the floor. It was interesting to observe that in the locality, palm is symbolically worshipped in every house as Mangala (Garnayak 2008a).

### *Pakhanapathar/Lekhapathar (Latitude: 22° 16*′ *57*″ *N and Longitude: 86° 05*′ *23*″*E)*

The rock shelter of Pakhanapathar/Lekhapathar is situated near Jamda in Bahalda tehsil of Mayurbhanj district. This shelter has an enigmatic depiction; and to the local peoples, it is some sort of a sacred writing related to a magical maze. The local people venerate the hillock as the abode of gods and goddesses and worship it. A *mela* (festival) is organized every year in the foot hills in honour of the deities whose abode is on the hillock.

### *Chhatagarh Shelter (Latitude: 21° 05*′ *11*″ *N and Longitude: 84° 27*′ *12*″*E)*

The Chhatagarh shelter is situated at a distance of about 05 km north of the village Bastamjhuli in Redhakhol tehsil of Sambalpur district. The shelter is an important place of worship for the locals. The shelter is considered as a sacred shrine of goddess Vanadurga – a blissful aspect of the mother goddess Durga who is responsible for the welfare of the forest dwellers. The local people worship this goddess and make trident symbols with vermilion mixed with ghee on the wall of this shelter for peace and prosperity (Fig. 11.3).

### *Bhimamandali Shelter (Latitude: 21° 11*′ *82*″ *N and Longitude: 84° 30*′ *77*″*E)*

A group of shelters known as Bhimamandali is located near the village Naktideul in the Sambalpur district which is named after the epic hero Bhima. It is named after him because of the belief that it was an abode of Bhima. This shelter contains some petroglyph symbols of deer, turtles, vulvas, foot print, diamond chain patterns, cup marks, cupules, geometric pattern, honeycomb pattern, etc. One of the shelters of the site is known as the *Bhima Pathsala* (the school of Bhima), and the petroglyph is considered to be the sacred script written by Bhima (Pradhan 2001; Garnayak 2008a).

### *Deulluga Ushakuthi (Latitude: 21° 09*′ *96*″ *N and Longitude: 84° 40*′ *24*″*E)*

The rock shelter of Deulluga Ushakuthi is situated in the Hitasara village near Redhakhol tehsil of Sambalpur district. Ushakuthi is the generic name of the rock shelter where Deulluga is prefixed for easy recognition of the site. The word 'Deulluga' is a combination of two words 'De/Dia', meaning God and goddess, and 'Ulga', meaning to bow down the head. Both the tribal and non-tribal people are residing in this area. Chasa-an agriculturalist community possesses a predominant position in the demographic structure in this locality. The Binjhal, the Kondh, the Sabar and the Gond are the major tribal groups of this region. Both these tribal and non-tribal have equal respect for the shelter. It is a common belief found among these people that the pictured rock shelters are the abode of heavenly gods and goddess; and because of this, the people of the locality have a great respect and veneration towards these shelters**.** Since this rock shelter is related to their religion and it is believed as the abode of their deities and spirits, any local is usually afraid of visiting this site alone, other than on festive occasions or rituals, even at the daytime. It is believed that if they touch or cause any type of damage to these arts, they will be punished by the deities or spirits, and they will suffer from diarrhoea or blood vomiting or both (Garnayak 2008a).

### *Khandataruali (Latitude: 21° 09*′ *46*″ *N and Longitude: 84° 40*′ *69*″*E)*

This rock shelter, located near to Deulluga Ushakuthi, is situated in the Hitasara village near Redhakhol tehsil of Sambalpur district. Although there is no rock art present in this shelter, still it is very important for the locals who hold some religious beliefs about it. There are a number of iron swords, dagger, chains, axes, spears, etc. which are kept inside the shelter (see Fig. 11.4). It is a practice, as was observed during field study, that the villagers or other people of nearby areas, while passing through this site, offer their veneration by offering vermilion, coconuts, incense sticks, etc. From the local people, it is learnt that these iron weapons were kept by the freedom fighters who fought against the British rule. But in the recent time, these materials are related with a belief that if anybody takes away these weapons from this shelter, then he/she may die of diarrhoea or blood vomiting.

Apart from this, there are other beliefs relating to this shelter which are making round in this area and glorifying the benevolence of the deities or spirits of the site. People believed that in earlier time, if any poor villager faced the problem of shortage of plates to serve food to his guests during his daughter's marriage, he used to visit this shelter, and after worshipping at this site, he would express his problem about the shortage of plates/utensils. It is believed that in his second visit after a night or some time interval, he used to get necessary utensils, which were being kept in a place in the shelter. After using these utensils, the users would clean and return them at the site. But sometimes, because of the carelessness, some people did not return these utensils properly, and since then the supernatural power stopped helping the villagers (Garnayak 2008a).

#### *Pujadunguri (Latitude: 21° 03*′ *04*″ *N and Longitude: 83° 41*′ *87*″*E)*

Pujadunguri, a group of granite outcrops having the evidence of some prehistoric rock art, is located along the border of the revenue jurisdiction of two tehesils of Binka and Rampur in the district of Suvernapur. Each granite outcrops of this place has a specific name, like Chandli Ushakuthi, Baghdunguri Ushakuthi, Pujadunguri Ushakuthi, etc. The site is located at a distance of about 7 km southeast of Rampur. Since this Pujadunguri shelter is believed to be the seat of the goddesses Chandalipat and Vanadurga, it is considered as a sacred place by the local tribal and other people. A priest from the Binjhal tribe is engaged in the worship of these deities. The people of other tribal and non-tribal communities also worship and venerate to these deities with equal respect and devotion. Besides, there are several boulders present in the site which perhaps were manipulated during the prehistoric time to form the shape of *yoni* (vulva) (Pradhan 2001 and Garnayak 2008a).

#### *Jogimath (Latitude: 20° 16*′ *70*″ *N and Longitude: 82° 48*′ *99*″*E)*

The rock shelter of Jogimath is located on the top of a granite hillock near village Risigaon, at a distance of about 500 metres from Risipith and 10 kilometres from the village Khariarin in Nuapara district. The name of the shelter is derived from combining two words, *Jogi* (recluse) and *matha* (the abode), and hence the meaning of Jogimatha – the place or abode of a monk (Garnayak 2008a), though the shelter has prehistoric rock art. As the shelter was once the abode of a monk, local people consider it to be the abode of *Risis* (monks) and thus sacred. No doubt, the locals venerate the shelter throughout the year by making offerings. It is painful to note that the antique paintings in this shelter suffer from a large-scale disfigurement by superimposition of Hindu ritual symbols (Fig. 11.5). The local people smear

![](_page_10_Picture_4.jpeg)

**Fig. 11.5** Superimposition with Hindu ritual symbols on rock art shelter of Jogimath. (*Source*: author)

vermilion and ghee on the wall of the shelter and prepare trident, swastika and other ritual symbols on it. Besides, the students of Khariar College vandalize the rock picture when they bring the Athletic Flame from the rock shelter for their Annual Athletic Meet. During that time they perform a special *puja* at the shelter and apply ghee and vermilion on the wall for preparing symbols and emblems, thereby causing disfigurement to the prehistoric paintings.

### *Pandava Bakhara (Latitude: 20° 25*′ *45*″ *N and Longitude: 85° 38*′ *50*″*E)*

The rock art shelter of Pandava Bakhara is situated at a distance of 02 km west of the village Gayalabanka in Banki tehsil of Cuttack district. It is venerated by the local people as the abode of Pandavas who lived in the site during their exile (Fig. 11.6). The locals congregate at the shelter for festivity during the Raja Sankranti (January 13/14). Another shelter with same name, located opposite of the hillock, is regularly worshipped by the locals for their welfare. This shelter is very unique for its rich art tradition from the prehistoric time to the historic time. It preserves rock art, murals of floral motifs, foot prints (in one of the rock cut chamber within the rock art shelter wall), human forms, and images of Lord Jagannath,

**Fig. 11.6** Worship at the rock art site of Pandava Bakhara. (*Source*: author)

Balabhadra and Subhadra. It exhibits the belief system of the people along with associated practices from a bygone time to the present religious practices of the Jain and the Hindu pantheons (Garnayak 2008b).

## **Conclusion**

These rock art sites of Odisha are created by our prehistoric denizens. These sites stand proof to their knowledge, beliefs, practices and artistic genius. Who are the authors of these sites is not known and who would claim the legacy of the heritage is not a question, for it has evolved over years as a common heritage of humanity living around these shelters. It is therefore not a surprise to note the significance of these sites among the tribal and non-tribal people alike of the contemporary world. The prehistoric people painted different anthropomorphic figurines, flora and fauna designs as well as geometric designs, which are considered either sacred/ritual symbols or symbols having some religious importance pertaining to local traditions. Sometimes, it is also believed that these symbols are the creatures of their ancestors, deities, spirits, etc. Sometimes, these symbols are also correlated with their mythology and believed to be creations of their epic heroes. The sites are also believed to be sacred places and the abode of god and goddess or of epic heroes. In Hindu-Brahmanical religious practices, pictures drawn in a variety of colours have a symbolic significance in most of the rituals and sacrifices. These rock arts can be interpreted as the symbol of fertility, curing, totemistic, hunting magic, recording of astronomical events and several other rituals, etc. It has been noticed that most of the motifs in the rock art repeatedly occurred in the same shelter as well as in nearby shelter which give an impression as if they are meant for transmission of some kind of symbolic message. The rock art heritage of the state provides first-hand information on society, beliefs, rites, rituals, costumes, tools and implements, technological attainment, means of subsistence, contemporary flora and fauna, and above all human-nature relationship. Human vandalism is a major threat to any rock art sites where the tourists, picnickers and others destroy the shelters. Correlation of these rock arts with religion and the existing beliefs and practices by the locals at the site help preserve these age old paintings or art forms. Because of this belief system, the local people usually visit to these rock art sites only during the festive occasions or at the time of performing any ritual at the site. Usually, they are afraid of visiting the rock art sites alone during any other time which helps to prevent the site from destruction. The rock art site presents a dimension of Indian civilization where tribal and non-tribal coexist and share the belief system irrespective of its belonging to any group.
