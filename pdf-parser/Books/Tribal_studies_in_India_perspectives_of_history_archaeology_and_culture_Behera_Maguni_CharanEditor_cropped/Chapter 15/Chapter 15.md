**Tiasunep and Neingusanuo Solo**

**Abstract** This chapter marks out a sense of history in synchronic tradition of Christian Chang Naga of Yangpi village of Nagaland with reference to village Morung. Though Morung is a pre-Christian sociocultural institution, it continues to exist in present time to celebrate the past whose relevance is lost or declined. It stands as an identity marker with a link to oral traditions and symbols of artistic creativity, which are preserved and which convey cultural meanings of pre-Christian Naga ideals. The chapter analyzes meanings attached to symbols, presents the multi-dimensional functions of the Morung in bygone days and thereby defines past ideals and identity. Essentially, the paper tries to posit the past with present ideals in order that the identity of Chang Naga is appreciated in totality over time.

# **Introduction**

Morung1 as a multifunctional institution, particularly as an institution of educating the young men2 of the villages (Jamir and Lanuningsang 2005: 75–100) of Nagaland, is extensively elaborated in many earlier works (see Mills 1926b; Haimendorf 1938,

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-32-9026-6\_15

<sup>1</sup>Morung is an Assamese word for Bachelor's dormitory (Haimendorf 1938: 350; Hutton 1965: 23). Concerned tribe or village has its own term for it. In Yangpi, the term for Morung is *Chu* or *Chupang.*

<sup>2</sup> In Changki group of Ao Naga tribe, the Morung traditionally played the role of educating young boys. The data of Changki is based on firsthand experience; as one of the authors, Tiasunep is from the Changki group. Though there are more age groups beyond *Achang charoba ori*, members belonging to those age groups were normally married and therefore were not considered members

1950; Hutton 1965; Ketholesie 2015). It is a known fact that every society has its means and ways and institutional arrangement, to educate its youth in order to socialize them as members of the culture. Among a number of tribes in the Northeast India including the tribes of Nagaland, Morung was an institutional arrangement for carrying out such an activity, educating the young boys (Ketholesie 2015) in the culture. In precolonial period, every Naga village was an independent village. Thus, each village had its own Morung, or in some cases, each khel3 or clan had its own Morung. Several articles and books have depicted how Morung functioned as an educating institution (see Mills 1926b; Haimendorf 1938, 1950; Hutton 1965; Jamir and Lanuningsang 2005; Ketholesie 2015) before it declined on the influence of Christianity.

# **Naga Morung in Literature**

As administrative requirement of the colonial rulers, colonial writers produced literature on Naga culture (Hutton 1921a, b; Mills 1922, 1926a), mostly monographs of individual Naga tribes, in which functions of Naga Morung have been described elaborately. Description of how Morung functioned as an institution of education is found in the ethnography of *The Ao Nagas* by J.P. Mills (1926b). In this ethnographic monograph of Ao Nagas, it is elaborated how boys were divided into different age groups, each age group having its specific duties; and in performing group-specific assignment, the young boys used to learn through participation, the life skill education. It was an arrangement of learning by doing, though it was a part of the whole system of education, for storytelling, riddles, instructions from seniors, etc. were means of education. Here Changki system (Changki language group of the Ao Naga tribe) is discussed to present how Morung institution used to educate its members, which according to J.P. Mills, 'illustrates the working of age-group particularly clearly' (Mills 1926b: 177; c.f. Pertin 2009). In Changki community, a male member entered Morung at around the age of 17 years. This was the first age gradation, and each gradation consisted of members within a range of 3 years. After every 3 years, members of one age group were promoted to the next age group as long as they remained in the Morung. Each member of the Morung was assigned

in the Morung like those sleeping in it. Therefore, the duties of those age groups are not discussed here. For information about sleeping in dormitory of young women, refer to the article by K. Mann (1989) and Jamir and Lanuningsang (2005: 100–112).

<sup>3</sup>The word 'khel' is an Assamese word used to describe basis of divisions in Naga villages (Haimendorf 1938: 353). The divisions could be according to clans; however all the villages are not divided along clan or lineage. In case of Yangpi village, khel is territory based rather than clan or lineage based. The area where the first settlers made their village is known as *Nokphu*; the area below Nokphu towards the eastern direction is known as *Mepongtang khel*; *Mepong* means wind; *Tang* means direction. As the name suggests, this area is quite windy, and it was also observed during the fieldwork. The word *Yase* literally means new village.

duties and responsibilities according to his age group. The names of various age groups according to their responsibilities in the Morung were as follows:

- *Süngpo ori*: This was the youngest age group in Morung; the primary duty of its members was to carry message to every household when required. In addition, its members used to sharpen war implements like *dao* (matchete) and spear before going to any feud, hunting or war. In case of village meeting, it was the responsibility of members of this age group to arrange the *taktsü* (cup made of bamboo). After 3 years members of this age group were promoted to *Teküpba ori.*
- *Teküpba ori*: This was the second age-gradation-based group in the Morung whose members were responsible for carrying messages beyond the village. After 3 years of apprenticeship as messengers beyond the village, the members were promoted to *Azü akang ori,* the third group based on age gradation.

*Azü akang ori*: This age group consisted of two subgroups known as:

- (a) *Azü akhang nozaba*
- (b) *Azü akhang tezemba*

The word *nozaba* means younger (junior) and *tezemba* means older/elder (senior). A person used to remain as a member in *Azü akhang nozaba* for a period of 3 years after which he was promoted to *Azü akhang tezemba,* the next higher order within *Azü akang ori*, where his membership was also for a period of 3 years. Thus, the age span of *Azü akang ori* spread over 6 years is divided into 3 block years for each subgroup in it. Members of this age group were responsible for checking absentees during village meetings and in community works and for collecting fine in cash or kind from the absentees subsequently. While all the members of this broad age group worked together, the members of *Azü akhang tezemba* had an additional responsibility of teaching the members of *Azü akhang nozaba* on norms, values and skills.

*Achang charoba ori*: Members of this age group had greater responsibility to perform relating to the community matter. Collection of rice from every household was the responsibility of its members during any community work or on the occasion of any outsider visiting the village.

Along with the function of Morung as educational institution, colonial writers have presented a good account of the structure of Morung buildings and designs on them. One of the most detailed and elaborate descriptions of Morung is found in the work of Christoph Haimendorf (1938) on the Konyak Morung. The building structure as well as its design is described as defence strategy against enemy attacks. The distribution of power and the social functions, motifs used, etc. have been elaborately discussed with reference to the Konyak Morung.

The works of Mills (1922, 1926b) and Haimendorf (1938), for example, are tribe-specific, and thus descriptions of Morung by them are not representative of the Morungs of all the Naga groups. It is to be mentioned that a village community or a tribe among the Nagas has its own institutional arrangement, structural significance of the house and design and meaning of motifs of Morung and significantly, as

J.H. Hutton (1965) observed, varied between villages and tribes. Not only are there earlier works in which Morung has a significant place, but several works on Morung are found even among the contemporary writers (Jamir and Lanuningsang 2005; Ketholesie 2015; Odyuo 2013). However, in contemporary works, other than description about the structure, motifs and function of Morung as educational institution, not much of additional insights are to be found. The present work is not an attempt to describe the institution of Morung, which has received enough attention in earlier works of colonial and contemporary writers, but investigates function of the Morung building itself and the identity of the people it reflects through various motifs in it. As mentioned, Mills (1922, 1926b) and Haimendorf (1938) described the design of Morung building in terms of its function as an effective defence strategy against attacks of enemies. In addition to these authors' presentation, a study of Morung can give deeper insight into identity construct through its function, structural design and motifs used. In view of this, Yangpi Morung4 is investigated as a case study.

# **Yangpi Morung**

Yangpi is a village of Chang Naga tribe, which comes under the district of Tuensang, Nagaland. Some of its neighbouring villages are Longra, Noksen, Litem, Phangpah, Pongching, Shakshi and Hukpang of Phom tribe and Mongtikang. Though they are known as Chang Naga tribe, in terms of linguistic affiliation, they have commonality with Ao Naga tribe.5 The Yangpi people believe to have originated from *Longterok* range, which is in the Sangtam area (i.e. Chare village). They believe that their ancestors originated in *Chungliyimti* (Noksang 1999), the place where Ao Nagas of Nagaland points to their origin (Mills 1926b). From Chungliyimti, they migrated to *Longpoyotsü*, which is near at present Longmisa village under Mokokchung district, and settled in their present village called Yangpi. The village has three main khels, namely, *Nokphu* khel, the oldest khel, *Mepongtang* khel and *Yase* khel.

Each khel has its Morung, named after the khel, and the territorial space of a khel is a village in itself for the members of the khel. In this sense village and clan territory are understood as synonyms. However, in Yangpi village, the names of the Morungs are Nokphu Morung, Mepongtang Morung and Yase Morung after the names of the khel. The Nokphu Morung is the oldest of the three Morungs. According to the folk history of Yangpi, Nokphu was the eldest man when they landed in the present Yangpi village after they left *Longpoyotsü*. The Morung was named after the eldest person among the first settlers of the village. The Mepongtang

<sup>4</sup>The data on Yangpi community and Yangpi Morung were collected during fieldwork in Yangpi village (i.e. 23 January to 1 February 2016).

<sup>5</sup>According to J.P. Mills, Ao Naga tribe can be divided into three linguistic groups: Chungli, Mongsen and Changki. Yangpi language resembles Changki and Mongsen. The inference to similarities between Yangpi and Ao Naga languages is based on firsthand observation.

Morung is the middle khel. The Mepongtang Morung was originally located at the site where the Yangpi Baptist church presently stands.6 The Yase Morung is located on the western side of the village. The word *Yase* literally means new village where '*Ya*' means village and '*se*' means new. This new khel was extended for the defence of the village. The Yangpi village was often attacked during which the enemies took the route where Yase khel is settled.7 In order to counter such attacks, warriors from every clan, a total of 30 strong warriors, were sent to form the new khel.8

Though Morung is connoted as a Bachelor's dormitory9 mostly in colonial writings, this does not mean that house was important only for the bachelors (cf. Pertin 2009). Morung house was a place where bachelors used to sleep and guard the village. In one of their folk songs, a bachelor sang to his newly married friend: 'When you are sleeping comfortably with your wife at night; I am guarding your street/ village'. This is so because his married friend is no more obligated to sleep in Morung and guard the village, though his membership does not cease. He used to participate in some activities of community interest or entertainment in the Morung. During day time, they take turns to look after the village each day.

The practice of bachelors sleeping in Morung, the traditional institution, stopped after Christianity was introduced in their village; and a dormitory maintained by the church10 took its place for the convert bachelors.

As mentioned, guarding the village was one of the crucial functions attached to Morung. The numbers of men staying back to guard the village differed in different Morungs. In case of Yase, it was four men, whereas in case of Nokphu and Mepongtang, the numbers were five men.11 The four men were of different ages – two elderly and two in their youth. The two elders stayed in Morung for their wisdom and to guide the youths in times of emergency. The younger ones were required to carry message as runners. Otherwise they communicated the message through beating of the log drum kept in their Morung. Every married man takes turn to guard

<sup>6</sup>The Mepongtang khel has a folk song that depicts the sadness they felt when their original Morung was brought down to build the church. The Mepongtang khel had to shift their Morung to another site, since the site where their original Morung stood was chosen to build their village church.

<sup>7</sup>The route where head hunters from Ao Naga and Sangtam Naga areas could enter.

<sup>8</sup> It is clear from the khels (clans) of the Yangpi village that a clan/khel can be genealogical or not genealogical.

<sup>9</sup>The sleeping dormitory for young women in Yangpi is called Themibiri *tsü*: *Themibiri,* widow; *tsü*, house*.* Young women would gather at a widow's house and sleep there together; the old widow would teach the young women. During the field work, we came across an elderly widow named Shongtola, 86 years old, who taught a folk song. Since she alone in the village knew that particular song, one of the authors (Tiasunep) inquired: Who taught you the song? She replied, 'I learned at *Themibiri tsü*'*.* (She is from Mepongtang khel, Interview date, 29 January 2016; Time, 5:40 P.M.)

<sup>10</sup>Discouraging the new converts to sleep in Morung is not unique to Yangpi village as documented by Richard M. Eaton (1997: 254). Instead, the church maintained its own dormitory where the church leaders can teach the young men about the Bible and Christianity. The dormitory maintained by the church is no more in existence.

<sup>11</sup>This is so because among the three khels, Yase is smallest and therefore lesser in number of residents.

the village during day time, the practice they still continue, though Morung culture no more exits. Even though the practice of head hunting12 has come to an end, most of the villagers still pursue jhum cultivation; thus during day time, only children and very elderly ones are left behind in the village, who need to be guarded, and the houses need to be protected especially from fire incidents. Obviously, at present, guarding the village means looking after the children and elderly persons left behind in the village and ensuring the safety of the village.

# **Structure of Morung**

Morung is rectangular in shape. At the back of the interior part of the Morung is the sitting platform, where people can sit around. The side walls are covered; however there are crisscross of holes (*koki*) made in all directions so that one can use spear against the enemies, if they happen to stand outside it. The highest point of Morung is its front side which slopes down towards the other end of the house. The front side of the Morung is well decorated with wood carvings and paintings. Generally, hornbill and tiger are sculpted (Fig. 15.1). Tiger is sculpted at the centre post and hornbill is engraved on the side posts. Paintings contain rooster, mithun, other animals,

<sup>12</sup>Each Naga community has its own term for the practice which in English is translated as head hunting. The word trophy is nearest in meaning than the term *head hunting* given to name the practice.

spears and daos, V-shaped painting. At the top of the roof towards the front side are three bamboos along with its roots, each in the shape of hockey stick, projected. These bamboo roots are locally known as *shem.*

# **Meaning in Its Cultural Context**

The wood carvings and paintings of tiger, rooster, hornbill, V-shaped symbol, mithun head, etc. are impregnated with cultural meanings. All these meanings however exist in the web of other meanings or woven along with other elements of culture. Thus, in order to understand the meaning of such carvings and paintings, their meanings have to be understood in the light of the broader pre-Christian cultural context.

*Tiger (Khor)* Pre-Christian and precolonial Nagas were involved in inter-village feuds and attacks (Hutton 1928). In order to present themselves ferocious and brave, they used to carve tiger symbol in Morung building, for tiger is known for such attributes.

*Bamboo Roots (Shem)* The carved bamboo roots used at the top in front of Morung symbolize the tusk of wild boar. Wild boar (*Pongi*) generally stands for toughness and bravery in their folk songs. In one of their folk songs, the line 'Oh Pongi tsülo ben tongtep' literally means 'in the manner of wild boar we fought'. Tusk of wild boar was also used in the Morung, along with bamboo roots or independently to convey that the people of Yangpi village are tough and brave like a wild boar while fighting with their enemies.

*Hornbill (Tenem)* Hornbill13 symbolizes beauty. To refer to someone as hornbill is to say that he is handsome or she is beautiful. Thus, hornbill is carved at Morung to represent their sense of appreciation to beauty. In the days of the past, when Yangpi people went to dance in the house of a rich man at Chuchuyimlang village, an Ao Naga village under Mokokchung district, they used to address the daughter of the rich man as hornbill as a complement to her beauty.

*V-shaped Symbol/Tattoo (Theromerang)* In a culture surrounded by enemies (Hutton 1928), it is not a matter of surprise that warriors were honoured. And if a community has to survive in such an environment, it has to reward those individuals who risk their lives in wars in order that others get encouraged and inspired. Awarding an honoured status with a V-shaped symbol was a practice in Yangpi village during the days of inter-village feuds. The individual warrior who used to bring the trophy of enemy's head was awarded with the V-shaped tattoo so as to exhibit

<sup>13</sup>Using hornbill as symbol for beauty is common among the Nagas. Its feathers are used in traditional dress for beautification.

his status in the society as a higher order of warrior. If a warrior was able to take an enemy head, he was allowed to have the **V**-shaped tattoo (*Theromerang*) on the chest.14 Thus if a person has the V-shaped tattoo in his chest, it symbolizes that he has hunted the enemy's head. This V-shaped tattoo in his chest is accompanied by another tattoo in his arms, which is circular in shape. Thus, painting of the V-shaped symbol (Fig. 15.3) in Morung at present suggests that the members of the Morung were once head hunters, thus adding to their claim of bravery and ferocity. The tradition remains without its functionality.

*Rooster (Towei tepong)* Yangpi villagers worshipped the *Piong* mountain (the highest hilltop visible in the northeast direction of the village) for which they annually sacrificed a rooster (*towei tepong*) and a pig (*towa*).15 Besides, rooster was often used in many of the rituals as sacrifice to appease the supernatural power involved in causing sorrow and happiness. Accordingly, the depiction of rooster in Morung stands for their religious belief and practices.

*Mithun16 (Moya sübong)* Mithuns were often killed by the rich on the occasion of the feast of merit.17 To proclaim that someone killed a mithun for feasting the villagers is a proclamation of the richness of the individual. And thus, the depiction of mithun (*moya sübong*) in their Morung is the declaration of the richness of the village, in which they took immense glory.

Those are motifs engraved and painted in Nokphu Morung. In Yase Morung (Fig. 15.2), besides these motifs, an elephant (*shadi*) and a mithun (*moya sübong*) have been craved as well. To understand the significance of it, one has to understand the history of the village. When the first settlers of Yangpi village came, they settled at the place settled by Nokphu khel at present.

Enemies often raided the village taking the route of the western direction of the village. As a precautionary strategy, 30 warriors drawn from all clans were sent to form a new khel, named Yase, to check the enemies coming from that direction. According to their folk narratives, after the formation of the Yase khel, its members captured an elephant (*shadi*) and a wild mithun. Needless to say, the mithun engraved in Yase Morung (Fig. 15.3) does not convey the same meaning as in Nokphu Morung. The mithun (*moya sübong*) and elephant (*shadi*) stand to showcase their achievements.

<sup>14</sup>The V-shaped tattoo on the chest as a symbol for head hunting is found among the other Naga tribes. When one of the authors (Tiasunep) visited Yachem village of Phom Naga tribe, there was an old person with such a tattoo in his chest. One reason for such similarity between Yachem and Yangpi may be because they lived very near to each other; Yangpi people lived in *Longpoyotsü* and Yachem people at *Mongoya* during their migration. However, it is to be noted that Ao Naga tribe also used similar symbol. Using of this pattern of tattoo is reviewed by Carl Schuster (1952).

<sup>15</sup>Annual worship of mountain and sacrifice of animals such as a pig and a rooster were in practice even among the Ao Nagas. Using rooster as sacrifice is common among the Ao Nagas and other Naga tribes as well.

<sup>16</sup>The word *mithun* is commonly used in Northeast India to denote a semi-domestic animal, believed to be the cross-breed of bison and yak; its scientific name is *Bos frontalis.*

<sup>17</sup>Giving away feast of merit by killing Mithun is considered prestigious among all Naga tribes.

But why take pride in hunting down those animals? Hunting has a crucial place in Yangpi culture. There are many beliefs, rituals and practices related to hunting. Even to this day, the glory one takes in hunting is clearly apparent as those beliefs, rituals and practices related to hunting are still practised.

In most of the houses in the village, several trophy skulls are hung in the kitchen. The animal skulls are hung in rows. The skulls they kept in the house are however not just bare skulls; rather these are covered with rich flesh of meaning and belief. One informant, Lemba,18 said exhibition of skulls shows presence of man/men in the house. In a house if the numbers of skulls are more, it is inferred that at least one member of the house is a skilful hunter. They also believe that the soul of the animal whose skull is hung in the house will attract its partner from the forest. This means the hunter will hunt more animals. This practice of hanging the skull however has its convention. The first skull of the hunted animal is usually hung near the door, and from there, the hanging proceeds towards the back side of the house as more animals are hunted. This is so because the hunted animals were brought through the front door, and therefore skulls are placed from that direction in order to bring good luck. Hunting of animals is considered as an act of skill and bravery by the people. It is but natural that they depicted animals (mithun and elephant) in Yase Morung to proclaim their act of bravery, their skill in hunting and their victory and achievement. It also adds to the pride of the members of the khel in that Yase khel was the only khel whose members could kill the mithun and elephant.

Upon asking the meaning of sun and stars that are depicted in Nokphu Morung, there was no single explanation. Different interpretations were provided. One of the interpretations relate it to the sunlight which the village receives first, while another relates the symbols to a myth, according to which the symbols stand for the brightness. It is believed that the world was covered with darkness in the beginning. It was through the hunting of a tiger that the world brightened up. The symbols of the sun and the stars are commemorative of their victory over darkness. Still others had a different interpretation to offer. The symbols convey that their ancestors outshined their enemies. When the tradition is not in practice, but remains in common memory, it is but natural of a phenomenon to offer various interpretations. This is not unique to Yangpi, as the words of John D. Rhoades (2010: 272) shows:

Many studies of how symbols are used have shown that there may be considerable variation within a single community about the interpretation of symbolic content and an ongoing negotiation of this interpretation. Throughout the past century, American anthropology considered the effect of culture change, especially acculturation, on the shared value of symbols. The openness of symbol content also means that their content is subject to change and, in the acculturative process, different segments of a community—perhaps generational will likely change their understanding of, even adherence to, certain symbols.

<sup>18</sup>The Yangpi Student Union on learning that we came for research volunteered to serve as translators for our research team. Lemba was a member of this student union and in-charge of the union's library. He was with the team as one of the translators. Upon seeing the animal skulls, he made the quoted remark on 28 January 2016.

# **Painting of Morung's Motifs**

The carvings and paintings in Yangpi, as so far we discussed, conveyed secular meanings. But these symbols have also ritualistic significance as per religious norms of the people. There are certain taboos even in these days which the people strictly observe. There is a gender bias as only male members are eligible for the work and from among the male members only those members who are selected by the village head are engaged in the work of carving and painting. Except them others are not allowed to touch the paint even, for, as they believe, the durability of the paintings will be reduced if touched by others.

Usually, the people used black colour in the paintings of the Morung which was prepared in early days by a mixture of the blood of pigs and the ash of burned leaves. *Kichongse* (*Garcinia pedunculata*19), a fruit which turns yellow when ripen, was used for colouring the beak of hornbill. During the time of painting, sexual intercourse was strictly tabooed for the painter (s). Abstinence from sex was also attributed to durability of paintings. During carving and painting of the Morung symbols, only the painter used to receive six pieces20 of pork, which were tabooed to be shared by him with the other workers in the Morung. Even he was prohibited to eat from others' cooking, and so he had to cook the met by himself in the Morung in a different cooking pot. The painter was also not allowed to take the meat home and partake with family members. Any person who shares the meat with the painter, it is believed, suffers from insanity. The notion of purity by abstaining from sex and observing the restrictions in cooking and sharing the pork with others maintained by the painter is central to the tradition of painting in the Morung. However, the notion of purity in the form of abstinence from sex is not confined to the tradition of paining alone; it has wider practice. For example, male members involved in burning their jhum field21 also abstain from sex the night before.

# **Discussion and Conclusion**

The carvings and paintings depicted in Yangpi Morung cannot be studied in the sense of evaluating a piece of art. The meanings embodied in these pieces of art reflect a holistic understanding in a cultural perspective displaying a change and

<sup>19</sup>*Garcinia pedunculata* popularly known as *bor thekera* in Assamese is endemic to the southeastern regions of Asia such as parts of Myanmar and northeastern parts of India.

<sup>20</sup>Approximate dimension of each pieces = 5 inches × 7 inches.

<sup>21</sup>The Yangpi villagers practise jhum cultivation, which involves cutting down of forest and burning it. The night before the day they will burn their field, they will announce the villagers by voicing out loud from strategic places so that all the villagers can hear. When they announce they will say, 'Tomorrow our village will attack village **X** and therefore shut the mouth of the dog'*.* The name of the village they will name depends on the direction of their jhum for that particular year. As for 'shut the mouth of the dog', it is meant for the men folk not to engage in sex but to maintain celibacy. This is still in practice, in relation to jhum cultivation.

continuity from historical time. Even though the tradition of Morung life has disappeared, the collective memory celebrates it as reflected in the practice of preservation of traditional carvings and paintings in the Morung. The carvings and paintings reflect what they were and what they value at present in terms of bravery associated with head hunting, social status gained by organizing feast of merit, sense of appreciation to beauty and respect to traditional faiths and beliefs.

Needless to say, the art in the Morung was not detached from other cultural elements, but it was immersed in the very fabric of their common culture. In other words, their art was not a mere creation of idiosyncratic individuals, but something representative of their common heritage, upon which every member of the culture had a share in taking pride and building up a common identity.

Not only do the symbols of Morung represent the essence of what they value in their culture but the meaning associated with them conveys the sense of purity as expressed through restrictions. This brings home the message that the artistic carvings and painting were not merely art for art sake, but something they created meanings to construct and reinforce a cultural identity. Thus, to stop at noting the artistic side of Morung buildings and its design for defence or to ignore meaning that they convey in a cultural perspective is to miss out what the Morung house represents in its totality.

The seriousness with which those carvings and paintings were considered during the pre-Christian era can be appreciated from conflicts between the non-Christians and the newly converted Christians over the Morung. Tajen Ao,22 the first advocate from Nagaland, has presented few such cases of conflict (Ao 1984: 126–128). He mentioned that the new converts to Christianity 'raised serious objections' against Morung. Such disputes were often settled in courts. In a dispute 'Ponintemching G.B vs. Sanchemkaba', case no. 43, dated 23.3.1914, the 'accused ordered the children not to work in the Morung, for working in the Morung is not sacred because it contains carvings of animals. He is fined Rs. 10'. Here, the question arises: why would the carvings of animals' make Morung sacrileges? The wood carving by itself is not objectionable, but when those carvings are interpreted to convey cultural meanings, they come into conflict with the new Christian worldview. Thus, this case and the matter of disputes reveal that when contemporary writers depict the art of Morung purely in its aesthetic aspect, they are presenting the symbols divorced from its meaning in totality. In other words, to present only the aesthetic aspect of wood carvings and paintings in Morung is to describe the art of Morung as if they occurred in cultural vacuum.

Another case of dispute was 'Ponintemching G.B vs. Sanglemba', case no. 42, dated 24.3.1914, where the accused refused to work in the Morung. The accused objected to work on the ground that the Morung was built with *gennas* and heathen rites. Several such cases are those 'Gaonburas vs. Christians' of Mopongchuket village, case no. 15, dated 25.4.18; 'Ancients vs. Christians' of Sungratsü, case no. 56, dated 25.7.1935; and 'Baptist vs. Ancients' of Mokongtsü village dated 4.8.32. In the latter case, the Baptists objected to helping their fellow villagers to build the Morung. All these cases show that Morung was neither just a house nor a building void of spiritually activity; it stood for a value of its own having been filled with

cultural meanings which differed from the meanings in Christian worldview. Building of such a house was accompanied by observing what they thought would make themselves as well as the house itself pure. Almost all the court cases discussed are that of Ao Nagas; but it has relevance for the Yangpi as well. It was the Ao missionaries that introduced Christianity to the Yangpi villagers. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Christian converts in Yangpi stopped sleeping in Morung but started sleeping in a dormitory maintained by the church.

In a world where head hunting was a norm, it was but natural for the people to project themselves as ferocious, sturdy and brave. It is in their Morung that they expressed what they valued and what they celebrated. The paintings of mithun and the cup with which they drink rice beer project the prosperity of the village. The Morung of Yase is especially instructive because therein they exhibit what they alone could achieve, i.e. capturing an elephant and a wild mithun – an achievement wherein they took immense pride. The meanings attached to Morung were also the meanings that defined who they were. When the symbolism depicted in Morung is explored, one would be hard pressed to miss the point that it is through their Morung house; the Yangpi villagers announced who they were and who they are to the world and invite others to see their expression of who they think they are. And being the house of learning, the meanings expressed through symbols in the Morung serve as the source of inspiration for the younger generation to imbibe the ideals of becoming and being a member of Yangpi community.

European writers of early twentieth century might have missed that point. Their modern western worldview could have shaped the way they look at a building.23 Therefore, they viewed Morung simply from defence and artistic perspectives. In so doing, European writers missed the worldview24 with which the pre-Christian Nagas viewed their Morung and therefore failed to engage the total vision around the Morung. Contemporary writers from Nagaland having brought up in Christian worldview and educated in formal system almost repeat what Europeans wrote of the Morung. This is not to denounce what Europeans wrote about Nagas; these works are quite important in explaining Naga culture. However it brings home the insight that worldview can shape how we look at our surroundings, a critical insider view. And thus, understanding the worldview of pre-Christian Nagas is important when it comes to how they view the Morung house at present. When Morung is viewed in such perspective, Morung house has more to inform us about how they understood themselves, what they aspired to be, what they would wish to inculcate to the new members and how they wanted to express and display about who they are.

Does the meanings of the carvings and paintings of Morung still define who the Yangpis are? Do they still see themselves as ferocious and a strong village? Do they still take pride that they could conquer their enemies? Christianity entered the vil-

<sup>23</sup> In a post-Khunian world, it will make no sense to say that their worldview had no influence on the way they studied the Morung. For a good discussion on how paradigm effect scientific observation, refer to the work of Thomas Kuhn (1962).

lage of Yangpi on 13 April 1949.25 They marked it by celebrating its golden jubilee recently. Before the celebration of golden jubilee, they went around those villages who were their enemies during the days of head hunting, seeking forgiveness and reconciliation. Therein lies the pride of the present Yangpi. The values reflected through their Morung were the pride and identity of their ancestors; the values from the church now take its place in different ways and define their present identity.
