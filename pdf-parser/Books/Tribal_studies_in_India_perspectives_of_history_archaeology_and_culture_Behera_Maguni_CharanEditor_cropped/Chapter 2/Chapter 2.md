<sup>1&#</sup>x27;Bhil' is an exonym that derives from the Draidian word *Vil* or *Vilawar* meaning a bow or a bowman and indicates a prevalent perception of the Bhils as good archers (see Doshi 1971: 32). The earliest mention of the name Bhil in Sanskrit literature occurs in the *Kathāsarit-sāgara* of Gunadhya (c. AD 600) where there is a mention of an elephant-riding Bhil chief denying a king passage through the Vindhyas. Today the Bhils of Rajasthan are classified into Gametia Bhils (who claim to be descendants of the Bhil rulers and heads of the Bhil villages and who are concentrated in the northern and western parts of Udaipur district and in parts of Sirohi district), KatariaBhils (Dhariavad, Ashpur and Ghatol tehsils of Udaipur, Dungarpur and Banswara districts) and the Mama Bhils of Kushalgarh. The Bhils are the largest tribal community in Gujarat, where they are divided into major groups such as the Bhil Garasia, Vasavas, Pawra Bhil and Tavadi Bhil (see Singh 1997:118, 125–7).

elite among the Bhils. I have thus tried to break the traditional academic mould of treating tribal peoples as isolated and in a stereotyped image (see Roy 1915; Elwin 1942; Majumdar 1950; Dave 1960).

# **Colonial Reports and Changing Perceptions of the Bhils: A Brief Survey**

W. Crooke of the Bengal Civil Service, quoting from the *Rajputana Gazetteer* of the late nineteenth century, observes that all Bhils go about armed with tribal weapons, bows and arrows and keep quiet in the winter and the rainy season but indulge in raiding others thereafter (Crooke 1974:48–9. Also see Crooke 1978). At that time, notions of a hunting-gathering group reduced to the ranks of farm servants and field labourers dominated the definitions of the Bhils (Russell and Hira Lal 1969:292; Sherring 1975). However, the ethnographer R.E. Enthoven (1920:170) gave a more realistic description of the Bhils of Gujarat and Khandesh2 as peasants, labourers and watchmen.

Modern anthropological studies of the Bhils then began. Y.V.S Nath, analysing the social structure of the Bhils of Ratanmal, observes that they are primarily cultivators, and their non-agricultural income accrues from labouring on timber and charcoal coupes (dumps) in forests (Nath 1960:40). T.B. Naik (himself a Bhil) rightly opines that the Bhil economy was not of primitive character. The Bhils 'show rationality in their choice for the disposal of scarce means over numberless requirements', he states (Naik 1956:70). Echoing Naik's views, Ranvir Saxena states that the study of the economy of tribes in general is a study of rural economies in which agriculture and forests form the principal and secondary sources of livelihood (Saxena 1964:279; also see Kumar 1997:40).

Yet such observations failed to inspire the vision of the latest generation of anthropologists. For instance, a few of them feel tribal societies being nonindustrialized and non-monetized small-scale communities, 'the economy is only a part of the social setup' (Ramamani 1988:70) and 'in the absence of any mechanism for surplus appropriation; their mode of production hardly underwent any significant change' (Singh 1995:16). Neither scholar highlights the management of local resources or adaptations to alternative strategies for survival in particular historical settings (see also Casimier and Rao 1991; Lancaster and Lancaster 1997:367–78).

On the other hand, recent studies on state formation among tribes and in areas of tribal domination have not only disproved the idea of the tribes as an 'isolate', e.g. the cases of the Bhumijs of Barabhum (Sinha 1962:36–80), the Nagabanshis of Chota Nagpur (Singh 1987:51–72), Ahoms of Assam (Guha 1974:65–7) and the Dimasas of Cachar (Bhattacharjee 1987), but studies on state formation in Odisha (Eschmann et al. 1978) and eastern and north-eastern India (Sinha 1987) have also

stressed the processes of tribal acculturation. Since the importance of the Rajputs as agents of change has been recognized in many areas, this process has also been aptly described as Ksatriyaization (Eschmann, op cit.129) or Rajputization (Sinha, op. cit.:36). Sumit Guha (1999:199) observes that forests of varying but always significant extent coexisted with and among the cleared lands of peasant settlement for long and forest groups as specialists made optimal use of such niches. Forests were both political and military resources. Regional ruling elites could turn the hunter's mobility, resourcefulness and skills in weaponry to serve their own military ends. Hence, the forest folk were early integrated into the regional political economies. Tribal integration and tribal specialization necessitate differences which, in turn, become the 'organizing principles in inter-community relations' (ibid.). Hence, studies of the historical context of tribal communities reveal that the fixed notion of the Bhil tribe as a hunting-gathering group is not always correct.

# **The Bhils of Mewar and Dungarpur**

In this section, we shall highlight the interaction between the Bhils of Mewar and Dungarpur with states and with society at large. We will discuss similarities and differences in the experiences of the Bhils of Mewar and Dungarpur in their interaction with state and society.

The Bhils of Mewar (southern Rajasthan, comprising the districts of Udaipur, Chittorgarh and Bhilwara) regions occupied both politico-military importance and economic significance between the seventh and the fifteenth centuries. The tradition about Bappa Raval (the legendary founder of the Guhila dynasty of Mewar) and the Bhil chiefs of Oghna, Panarwa and Undri, Baleo and Dewa participating in the Rajput royal coronation ceremonies (the historic ritual of anointing the Ranas of Mewar at their accession with a tikặ of blood by the chiefs of these two Bhil settlements) points towards political alliances and negotiations of power (Sinha 1993:58). This custom, which continued until Jagat Simha's coronation in 1628 (Tod 1971a:183; also see Tod 1971b), could be a symbol of the transfer of power from Bhils to Guhila Rajput, but it would be difficult to say what kind of power the Bhils could have enjoyed or could have transferred.

The state of Mewar employed Bhils as forest guards and watchmen to control hill passes and forest routes. This is evident from such popular Bhil names as Vanaputras (children of the forest), Mairote (born of the mountain) and Goind (lord of the caves and lord of the pass) (Tod 1971a:39). In the medieval period, both Rajput and Bhil chiefs are known to have collected a levy called *rakhwali* (Sharda 1917:175–6) from travellers in their dominion as a fee for their protection (Mathur 1987:138). The state of Mewar, having interacted with and realized the importance of the Bhils, would have been eager to politically contain such leaders as the chief of Oghna. The latter held the title of Rana and belonged to the category of Bhumia chiefs (Tod, op. cit.:262). He enjoyed political importance in his own territory and hence considered himself as important as the Rajput chiefs of the peripheral areas (forests and

hills) of Mewar. Such chiefs might have facilitated the occasional mobilization of Bhil militias from within their own settlements for the wars of Mewar. Traditions have preserved accounts of Bhils fighting for both Rana Hammira and Rana Pratap in the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, respectively (Tod 1971a:262). The military importance of the chief of Oghna-Panarwa is also evident from his title as the 'head of five thousand bows' (Tod 1971a:262; also see Tod 1971b). The mobilization of armies by the different deities of Chittor and the consequent victory of its maharanas is a recurrent theme in the Bhil songs recently compiled by Giridharilal Sharma (1956: I:120 and II:115–20). Bhils may have also been mobilized by rulers for state projects such as the construction of fortresses, roads and bridges.

The trend of limited 'peasantization' (Shanin 1987:8) and the emergence of miners among the Bhils of the core area of the Mewar kingdom are evident in the Samoli inscription of AD 646. This record dates to the period of the beginning of local state formation in Udaipur district and refers to the opening of a mine (*ākara*) at Aranyakupagiri and the building of a temple for the goddess Aranyavasini (EI, 19:97–98)3 by certain *mahājanas* (a group of migrating entrepreneurs). The opening of mines in a hill locality perhaps led to some deforestation and the expansion of peasant settlements into Bhil territory. Also, the Brahmanization of a tribal deity (Eschmann et al., op. cit.) that was initiated by the *mahājanas* may mark the beginning of Guhila interest in the Bhil localities. The mining centre could have been opened either in the copper belt around Udaipur or in Zawar Mata, where lie zinclead-silver mines, about 45 km south of Udaipur (Craddock et al. 1989:62). It is significant that the celebrations and worship of Zawar Mata are a popular theme in Bhil folk songs, indicating a long association of the local Bhils with the Zawar mines (Sharma 1956:II:31–3). The fact that Bhil people participated in the operation of mines is evident from the discovery of charcoal retort dumps (smelting) at Zawar (Craddock et al., op. cit:56). Charcoal preparation has been one of the major economic pursuits of the majority of the Bhils engaged in non-agricultural activities (Gahlot and Dhar 1989:27). The Bhils also exchanged with the neighbouring rural settlements forest products such as honey, wax, gum and *anwal* (a tanning material) (ibid.:214; also see Archana Prasad's (2003) discussion in this volume of the role of tribal people in central India in the collection and exchange of forest produce). The Bhils must have also been suppliers of medicines, as the forests of the Mewar hills abound in plants and herbs of medicinal values such as *safed*, *musli*, *gugal* and *gokhmi* (ibid.:214). That the forests played an important economic role in the life of rural folk in southern Rajasthan is evident from the mention of forest routes (*vanamarga*) as the boundaries of an agricultural plot in a seventh-century record of the Guhilas of Kishkindha (EI, XXXIV:175).

It was not the case, however, that relations were entirely harmonious. Rana Hammira and Rana Khata are credited with military victories over the Bhils of Jilwara and the Meenas (EI, XXII:35 and Kothari 1985:142, verse no. 6). It was not easy to control either the Bhomat country (the hill and forest tracts of south-west Rajasthan inhabited by the majority of the Bhils) or even the Bhils in the heart of

<sup>3</sup>*Epigraphia Indica*, vol. 19, pp.97–68.

Mewar. Recurrent revolts by the Bhils of Bhomat are evident in inscriptional references to conquest of them by the Guhila Kings. In the fifteenth century, Maharana Kumbha fortified many passes to defend the area against the Bhils of Panarwa (Sinha 1997:63). Hence, not only the Bhils of Bhomat but also those of the core area of the Guhila state of Mewar seem to have been in and out of actual territorial control. At the same time, the long period of contact and the settlement of a Solanki Rajput family in Oghna-Panarwa in the seventeenth century (Mathur, op. cit.:28) could be responsible for the claim to Solanki caste (the category of Bhilalas) made by the chiefs of Oghna (Shyamaldas 1986:195). This claim may have its origins in a Bhil-Solanki marriage in the sixteenth century.

Epigraphic records of the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, the *NainsīrīKhyāt* of the seventeenth century (Nainsi 1960), and bardic traditions all point to the formation of a regional state in the Bhil locality of Dungrapur. However, a probe into the records and traditions reveals that tribal participation in the history of the medieval state of Dungrapur was somewhat different from that of Mewar.

The earliest evidence of Bhil residents in the villages of Dungarpur comes from a thirteenth-century inscription indicating the residence of some important Bhils in rural settlements. Copper plates of Virasimhadeva (AD 1293) refer to Bhil Nadhol and Bhil Ralhua in their list of witnesses to royal land grants made in the village of Mala near Dungrapur (EI, XXII: 185). The possible presence also of Bhil cultivatorscum-watchmen and forest guards in rural settlements may indicate that, as in Mewar, members of the rural society of Dungarpur had expanded agricultural activities into the Bhil domain. As late as the nineteenth century, Bhils were employed to protect reserve forests of *mahua* and mango trees, to stop wasteful felling, to watch out for forest fires and to supervise water or shifting cultivation (Erskine 2000:143).

The process of regional state formation inevitably necessitated agrarian expansion. This point is evident from a series of land grants. Maharaval Virasimhadeva granted extensive land and a house to the Brahmana Talha of *Bharadwaja Gotra* in the village of Mala (ibid). Maharaval's *Mahāpradhān*, Vaman, made some (unspecified) grants to a temple of Siva near the tank at Barauda (ancient Vatapadraka, the first capital of the Dungarpur state) (Ojha 1936:61. fn 2). Virasimhadeva granted the village of Mangahadaka (Munger) to an astrologer, Bajhaditya (ibid., 62, fn.1). Maharaval also donated the village of Vasvasa (modern Varvasa) to one Sri Samkara (ibid., fn.2), a *purohita*. The economic and political significance of royal grants of land to brahmanas, priests and astrologers in early medieval central India and Orissa is too well known to repeat here (Sharma 1966:34–5). Extensive tribal land was brought under cultivation through the sociopolitical and technological intervention of the donees – brahmanas and priests.

Interestingly, the impact of the late thirteenth-century and early fourteenthcentury royal land grants on the Bhils of the Dungarpur region does not seem to have been so extensive as to ensure the 'peasantization' of the entire local tribe. Royal attempts to bring tribal land under cultivation seem to have been resisted, as is evident from the legendary association of the Bhils of Dungarpur with Maharaval Virasimhadeva and the rivalries between them. Local *khyāts* attribute the killing of Dungar Bhil to Shalashah Mahajan (a trader, who was appointed a minister in the

court of Dungarpur) on behalf of Maharaval Virasimhadeva (Ojha, op. cit., 58–9). But Virasimha never seems to have controlled the Dungarpur locality effectively, as all his records mention that he ruled from Vatapadraka (modern Barauda).

Although the *Badvā Khyāts* ascribe the foundation of the city of Dungarpur (the capital of the Guhila state of Dungarpur) to Maharaval Virasimhadeva in AD 1358, the foundation seems to have actually materialized under his grandson Dungarsimha, possibly around this date (ibid., 62–3). Thus, it is only with the process of territorial expansion that the problem of the incorporation of the Bhils presented a challenge to the Guhila state of Dungarpur. Bounded by the state of Mewar on its north, hills and forests on its south-west and the Sultanate of Gujarat on its south, the state of Dungarpur had to expand and consolidate its hold over the tribal belt, the Dungarpur locality. It became the base of the political operations of the Rajputs. Not only was there a need to increase revenues, but the Dungarpur settlement was also strategically important, as routes from Mewar to Malwa and Gujarat passed through this point (see the map of the *Link Routes of Mewar* from Dhabai 1975). Hence, the transfer of the capital from Vatapadraka to Dungarpur was a strategic move for the closer control of the local Bhils. Maharaval Gopinath actually sent an expedition against the Bhils under his minister Salharaj, a member of the Osval trading community. The Shantinath temple inscription at Antari, of AD 1468, credits Salharaj with the conquest of the Bhils (the inscription states that this minister rid Vagod of this trouble) (Ojha, op. cit., 66, fn. 2).

Recurring incursions into Dungarpur by the Sultans of Gujarat (ibid., 66–68) necessitated the exercise of effective control by the Rajputs over the inhabitants of the forest routes and hill passes. Thus, the period between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries seems to have witnessed a long process of territorial incorporation of Bhil groups. Undoubtedly, land grants to temples and the passage of traders through tribal territory brought many Bhils in proximity to periodic markets and fairs, facilitating their participation in the networks of local exchange. The possibility of the mobilization of Bhils as militiamen is evident from an epigraphic record of AD 1474 in Rampal (near Dungarpur). It records the bravery and death of Ratkala, son of Biliya, without being commanded by Maharaval, at the time of the sack of Dungarpur by Mandachalpati (Mandupati) Sultan Giyasuddin. Ojha (1936:69) identifies Ratkala as a Bhil, and this is quite plausible in view of the fact that in state records the political titles of Rajput chiefs were always mentioned, whereas non-Rajputs were identified by their *gotra* or lineage. Ratkala does not figure in this inscription with any title, *gotra* or lineage affiliation.

Perhaps a limited form of 'Rajputization' can also be seen in the erection of memorial stones by Bhil chiefs. A memorial stone stands on a hillock (Dhanmata Ki Pahari) at Dungarpur, commemorating the death of Dhani and Kali, wives of Bhil Dungaria (ibid.:59). Although the Rajputs adopted the traditions of memorial pillars from tribal peoples and transformed them into *goverdhanas*or *pāliyas* (memorial pillars of Rajput style), 'the social process which transformed the humble wooden pillars of the tribals into stone memorials with sculpted tops' (Chattopadhyaya 1994:122) underlines the social distance between Rajput and Bhil and consequently became something to be emulated by Bhil chiefs. It is also of interest that today the Bhils of Dungarpur participate in large numbers at Brahmanical festivals such as Gokalatham-Janmashtami and the Baneshwar fair at the temple of Mahadeva at the confluence of the Mahi and the Som and in Jain festivals at Rikhaladeva (Sehgal 1974:50, 54–55).

It is significant that the Bhil chiefs of Dungarpur, as early as the seventeenth century, claimed a 'history' of territorial predominance in the pre-Rajput period. Nainsi (1960) narrates that Dungarpur was controlled by a 'big' Bhil landlord (*barithakurai*), dungar, who led 5000 Bhils. Having convinced Dungar Bhil, Raval (the first Guhila king to found a kingdom in Dungarpur) and his men settled in Dungarpur. But Raval hatched a conspiracy and exterminated Dungar and his Bhils after inviting them to his daughter's wedding (Ranawat 1987:85–6). Equally significant is the fact that, in spite of territorial claims, the Bhil chiefs of Dungarpur, unlike those of Mewar, have never been associated with royal accession ceremonies.

What was the elite or royal response to Bhil perceptions of their past? Royal *Khyāts* mention that Dungar Bhil desired to marry the daughter of the minister, Osval Shalashaha. On the other hand, Raval Virasimhadeva (the king of Dungarpur) is known to have killed the Bhil chief, Dungar (Ojha, op. cit.:58–9). In fact, it was the *Badvā Khyāt* version which was adopted by the historians of Rajasthan in the nineteenth century (Shayamaldas, op. cit.:1005). In other words, the aspects of Bhil traditions which reveal elements of treachery and royal distance from the Bhil chiefs point perhaps to closer royal control of Bhil territory. Hence, the royal dependence on the Bhil chiefs seems to have been minimal, and the scope for social interaction between the Rajput ruling elite and the Bhil chiefs is likely to have been minimal. Consequently, unlike Mewar, there are no Bhils in the Dungarpur region (Sehgal, op. cit.:58) who have traditional claims to Rajput origin.

Although the Bhils of Mewar and Dungarpur interacted with the local Rajput states and society on similar terms, the different geo-political, strategic and economic situations of the Guhila states of Mewar and Dungarpur brought about differences in the behavioural pattern of the Bhils concerned, as well as royal perceptions of the Bhils.

The need for control of vast expanses of Bhil territory prompted the Guhila state of Mewar to settle Solanki Rajput chiefs in the Bhil settlement of Oghna, and the proximity between the Solankis and the Bhil chiefs of Oghna seems to have resulted in a social alliance and the claim of the Bhil chiefs to a higher status – 'Solanki Bhils' (the category of the Bhilalas). In contrast, better military control over the Bhils of Dungarpur seems to have offered less scope for tribal social mobility. The absence of Rajput Bhils or Bhilalas in Dungarpur is perhaps an important indication of this historical process.

# **The Bhils of Medieval Gujarat**

A study of early medieval and medieval Gujarat also confirms some of our observations regarding developments among the Bhils in Rajasthan. Historical sources indicate participation by the Bhils of Gujarat in the functioning of the Caulukyan state. It is important to note the different patterns of relationships between the Caulukyan state and the Bhils of different localities of Gujarat. While the Bhil localities of the Ahmedabad region had economic significance, the Bhils of Panchmahal occupied hills that had strategic importance for the Caulukyas. In this section we will explore the emergence of a new social status claimed by the Bhil chiefs of the Ahmedabad region in the medieval period.

Inscriptions of the reign of Mularaja I (the founder of the Caulukya dynasty) (Muni 1:73; IA VI:191: EI X:78) point to Caulukyan control over almost the whole of Kadi district and Viramgam *taluka*. Initially, the Caulukyas faced the local Bhils as militias in opposite camps. Hemacandra, in the *Dvyasrayakāvya* (an early twelfth-century text), refers to Bhillas as allies of the Abhira chief Graharipu against Mularaja (*Dvyasrayakāvya* Canto IV:16: vv. 20-40). The *Abhayatilakagani* (a midfourteenth-century text) confirms this fact (Narang 1972, Chap. vv. 2–3, Chap. II: v. 83). However, the Caulukyan state in the time of Mularaja I and his successor Bhima I does not seem to have been very successful in mobilizing agricultural revenues from the Bhil settlements. This fact is evident from the last inscription of Mularaja's reign: it refers to grants of land in Satyapura-Mandala or Sanchor in the Jodhpur region (Balera Grant, EI X, 1.3) of Rajasthan. These grants indicate the limited scope of agrarian expansion and resource mobilization from areas in Gujarat under Caulukyan control forcing expansion towards the north of Anhilwara. But Mularaja's construction of the temple of Mulesvara dedicated to Somanatha in Mandali (now Mandal) (Kadi Grant. IA, vol. VI: 191) in Viramgam *taluka* cannot be seen as only a religious act. The economic significance of the construction of this temple is evident from the extent of the grants. The village of Komboika was granted together with wood, grass, water and pastures (ibid.: 192, Plate II, 11.1–2). Although this early grant may not have converted Bhil settlement into 'peasant' settlements, the donee's right to natural resources is likely to have set the pace for the expansion of agriculture in a locality which did not seem to have many villages. It is significant that Komboika was not surrounded by villages on its boundaries. Until most of the villages granted, where boundaries were specified with reference to the neighbouring settlements, Komboika seems to have been situated in a sparsely settled area, one populated by tribes.

Bhima I of Gujarat made land grants in agricultural pockets in Koli and Bhil regions for different reasons. The Radhanpur inscription of AD 1028 records the grant of village Masura (bounded by the villages of Ghandaharika, Aikayska, Dharavalika and Prajharika) to Bhattaraka Ajapala, a native of Navanisaka, Kutch (LA VI:193–4). This grant did not have much to do with agricultural expansion, as this locality was already populated with villages. It seems from Ibn Asir's account of Mahmud Ghazni's march to Kutch that the Caulukyas made this grant to a Brahmana to gain allies in a newly annexed territory (LA VI:185).

Although the reference to the Bhils in Kutch is not direct, Ibn Asir states: Mahmud received intelligence that Bhim, the chief of Anhalwara, had gone to the fort of Kandahat (near Somnath, Gujarat), which is situated about forty *prasangs* from Somnath, between that place and the desert. He marched thither, and when he came in front of the place he questioned some men, who were hunting as to the tide. From them he learned that there was a practicable ford, but that if the wind blew a little he might be submerged. Mahmud prayed to the Almighty and then entered the water. He and his forces passed over safely and drove the enemy out of the place. From thence he returned, intending to proceed against Mansura (Elliot and Dowson 1955. 11:349). The 'hunters' who were knowledgeable about the details of the tides were possibly Bhils or Kolis (Patel 1971:141 and Deopujari 1973:61, 262–3).

The Palanpur plates of AD 1062 record the grant of three *halas* of land in the village of Varanavada (Idar in Mahikantha) to a *mahabrahmana*, Janaka. This village, too, was surrounded by others: Vara-asavali, Padra and Chhimdriyala (EI XXI:171–7).

Besides revenues, the Caulukyas needed passage through this largely tribal region for military reasons, since the Bhils guarded the forests and routes to Rajasthan. The fact that the Caulukyas had to enlist the support of the Bhil chiefs of Mahikantha for strategic reasons is evident in the problems they faced in the control of the Mount Abu region. Bhima's Mount Abu Vimala temple inscription of 1062 describes the Paramaras of Chandravati (Mount Abu) as recalcitrant elements (EI IX:148–58). Hence, the Bhils of Idar and Malukanta who guarded the forests and hill routes to Rajasthan were more important to the Caulukyas strategically than economically.

It is strange that today the Bhils of Ahmedabad district are only described as agricultural and miscellaneous labourers (Rajyagor et al. 1984: 207). A large gap seems to exist in our understanding of the distinction between the Bhils of the present day and those of the early medieval and medieval periods. The *Kumārapālacarita* (early thirteenth century) and the *Prabandhacintamani*<sup>4</sup> (early fourteenth century) refer to one Caulukya Karnadeva who defeated a Bhil chief named Asa and conquered Asapalli (SJ No. 41, (Muni 1956:39, *Prabandhacintamani,* op. cit. :55). Asapalli is identified with modern Ashawal near the city of Ahmedabad. The fact that Asa Bhil commanded the local Bhils is evident from the bardic tradition that he led an innumerable force of archers against the Caulukyan King (Forbes 1993: 103). Karna is supposed to have received an omen from Bhairavadeva and built at Asapalli a temple to the goddess Kocharba (*Prabandhacintamani*, op. cit.). In fact, there is a small village named Kochharba on the western bank of the Sabarmati, contiguous to Ahmedabad (city map of Ahmedabad 1917; Gillion 1968). Karna also build temples of Siva and the goddess Jayanti at Asapalli (*Prabandhacintamani* 1933:55).

The above account clearly reveals Caulukyan attempts at agrarian expansion in the Bhil localities of Ahmedabad, south-east of Anhilapataka. The royal construction of the temples of Siva and Jayanti is likely to have accelerated the growth of agricultural settlements. It is also significant that Karna won another Bhil ally, Bhilla Khangara (ibid.).

It is significant that Dholka (another Bhil locality near Ahmedabad), a thriving trading centre from the Caulukyan period onward, witnessed the construction of a huge water reservoir at the end of the eleventh century by the Caulukyan queen Minaladevi (Rajyagor et al., op. cit.:919). The Bhils of Dholka claim that this centre (ancient Viratpur) was governed by a Bhil queen, Sudishva, in ancient days (ibid.).

<sup>4</sup>Merutunga's *Prabandhacintamani*, Singhi Jain Granthamala, Santiniketan:Viswabharati, 1933.

The increasing need for revenue compelled the Caulukyas, like many of their contemporaries, to conduct regular raids into neighbouring states. There arose the necessity to control the marches into not only Rajasthan but also Malwa. Routes to Malwa ran through Sabarkantha and the Panchmahal hills, the Bhil country. King Bhima confronted some of the Bhils of the Panchmahals on his way to central India (Narang 1972: 16, Canto IV: vvv.41–5: 18, Canto IX vv. 1–10). Hemacandra credits King Jayasimha (Karna's successor) with conquest over the Raksasas or the Barbaras (Narang 1972:20). Jayasimha was given the epithet *Barbaraka Jisnu* (killer of the Barbara) in his Ujjain inscription (*IA* XLII: 258). The Barbarakas, Barbaras and Raksasas have been identified as Bhil tribes inhabiting the hills and forests of Gujarat (Majumdar 1956:81–82). If Jayasimha killed a Bhil chief on the battlefield, he seems to have also incorporated others into his state as allies. Hemachandra also refers to a Barbara presenting a number of valuables, including *manikyas*, to Jayasimha (*Dvyasrayakāvya*, Canto XIII 20, vv, 104). The clash with this Barbara seems to have originated with his attack on a temple at Sripurasthala (ibid. Canto XII:19–20, vv. 3–15). On the request of some sages, Jayasimba proceeded against this Barbara and defeated him (ibid.). Raksasas were also entrusted with the protection of Patalaloka (forests and hills) (ibid. Canto XIII 20; vv. 105– 110). Along with their chiefs, many aboriginal inhabitants are known to have joined the army of Kumarapala (Jayasimha's son and successor) (ibid., Canto XVI:21). Thus, two different localities of the Bhils seem to have been controlled by Jayasimha. The Bhils of Kochharba around Ahmedabad are likely to have resisted intrusion subsequent to Karna's expansion in the area. Hence, Jayasimha had to militarily subjugate the Bhils of Ahmedabad (Majumdar 1956:82). Second, as noted earlier, any expansion towards the south, Malwa, or Khandesh from Anhilapataka lay through Ahmedabad, Baroda, and the hills and forests of the Panchmahals (Parmar 1922: 701, map). Therefore, the Bhil chief presenting *manikyas* to Jayasimha can perhaps be identified as a chief of Rajpipla and his *manikyas* as the agate mined at Ratanpur in the west of Rajpipla state (ibid.:33).

Other valuables would have comprised forest products that the Bhils of the Panchmahal hills exchanged with local agriculturists. These hills, especially the areas of Pavagarla, Santrampur, Ratanmal and Devgarh (Devgadh) Baria, are rich in medicinal plants (Patel 1972:63). In the medieval period, *mahua* flowers were supplied to the merchants of Surat and Khambat for the manufacture of liquor (Nath 1960:35). Whether the Bhils of the Panchmahals, like those of Khandesh, were also involved in the manufacture of liquor or the supply of *mahua* timber for building purposes is a matter of conjecture. It is equally noteworthy that the Bhils of the small state of Devgarh (Devgadh) Baria (Panchmahal hills) have been anointing the local Rajas with a *tika* in blood at royal coronation ceremonies (Nath 1960:33).

References in the *Dvyasrayakāvya* to the protection of Patalaloka point to the royal appointment of Bhils as forest guards, watchmen and guides. Further, the 'Kiratas', who were knowledgeable about local topography and mining and who guided Jayasimha to the banks of the Sipra river (Jayasimha's march to Malwa) (*Dvyasrayakāvya*, Canto XIV:20:vv. 14–36), may have included some Bhils. Although Hemacandra does not identify the Bhillas with the Kiratas, both social

categories could have been mixed populations inhabiting the same localities in the hills and forests of the Panchmahals. The Bhillas are described in the *Abhayatilkagani*as experts in archery (ibid. 185).

The release of a 'Barbara' chief (ibid.) and his gifts of valuables to Jayasimha evidently point to the creation of military allies in the Bhil localities. It seems that Bhil chief repeatedly facilitated the mobilization of their kinsmen as militia in the royal army. Hemacandra refers to the army of Kumarpala's enemy, Anna, as consisting of men of the Jangala (forest) caste.

It is significant that in a list of 18 guilds in a twelfth-century text, the *Jambudvipāprajnath* (originally a Prakrit text, the *Jambudvipāpannoti*) Bhillas figure as one of the categories of guilds (Majumdar 1956:263, n. 41). This may signify the economic identity of those Bhils who had settled in the agricultural pockets and who offered special services as archers, militiamen, watchmen, forest guards, miners and construction labourers in the building of fortresses, roads and bridges.

The beginnings of the process of acculturation of some of the Bhils of Ahmedabad may have been possible with the royal construction of the temple of Kochharbadevi. This is likely to have set the pace for the Brahmanization of this local goddess (for a similar process in Orissa, see Eschmann et al. 1978). We also note that Asapalli-Karnavati ranked among the Jain centres of pilgrimage (IA VI:210).

In medieval times, the locality of Ahmedabad must have continued to be an important Bhil base for Bhils, for the legend of the conquest of Asa Bhil was appropriated by Persian historians. The *Mirat-i-Sikandiri*, an early seventeenth-century text, credits Ahmad Shah I with victory over Asa Bhil (Misra and Rahman, 1961:72). Bhils continued to contribute to the making of militias in the post-Caulukyan period. A sixteenth-century Arabic text, the *Zafar-ul-Walih-bi-Muzaffar-Waalihi*, mentions Bhils and Kolis helping the *amirs* of Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat in their attacks on Humayun at the Gulf of Khambat (Sandesara 1970:208). We thus infer that Bhils in different localities of Gujarat developed relationships at different levels with the surrounding state and society.

# **Bhils or Kolis?**

As a concluding note, it would be worth exploring the trajectory of social developments among the Bhils of Ahmedabad. Unlike Mewar or central India, the district of Ahmedabad does not have a population of Bhilalas or Bhils claiming Rajput descent. It is strange that in spite of long interaction with regional states and society, their chiefs did not claim a social status superior to their kinsmen. Did some of the Bhil chiefs of early medieval Ahmedabad claim the status of Kolis in the medieval period?

Hemachandra does not mention the Kolis in his list of social groups in the twelfth century. Did they emerge later in the Ahmedabad locality? Besides being a part of the agricultural population, the Kolis might have included some other social groups claiming agriculturist status. G.S. Ghurye observes, 'the overall designation of Koli, applied to a number of communities, only serves to disguise the variety of occupations and the different stages of cultural development which are met with in the different communities making up group' (1957:1). The Kolis were not good cultivators in the medieval period and are not described as an economically homogeneous group at the end of the nineteenth century.

The character of the Kolis, as agriculturists, varies much in different parts of the district. In the central villages, their fields can hardly be distinguished from those cultivated by Kunbis, while towards the frontiers they were little superior to those of the aboriginal tribes. Crimes of violence are occasionally committed among them; but, as a class, they have settled down in the position of peaceful husbandmen – a marked contrast to their lawless practices fifty years ago (*Imperial Gazetteer* n.d.: 98).

The Kolis of medieval Gujarat too figure in medieval source more as lawless elements than as peaceful producers. Raja Vikramajit, Shahjahan's governor of Gujarat, had to conduct an expedition in 1622 against some Kolis north of Ahmedabad who had been for generations a terror to travellers (Foster 1923:153). Between 1662 and 1668, a Baluchi adventurer impersonating the late Dara Shikoh successfully gathered around himself a large number of followers including the Kolis of Viramgam and Chunwal. The Mughal commander Mohabat Khan had to march out to drive him away and take control of the Kolis (Commissariat 1957:169).

Records of the East India Company mention that the Ahmedabad route to Surat was particularly dangerous because of the constant irruption of brigands, robbers and highwaymen. In fact, in 1644, some Kolis attacked a caravan between Ahmedabad and Broach (Gokhale 1979:88). Kolis armed with bows and arrows and muskets attacked Fidauddin Khan's forces in the mid-eighteenth century (Sandesara 1965:597–598). Like the Bhils, the Kolis also launched guerrilla attacks on Gaikwad forces. But it is significant that the eighteenth-century Kolis of Gujarat refused to identify with the Bhils. Alexander K. Forbes, writing on the Kolis and the Bhils of Mahikantha in the period of the Gaikwads, mentions that although these two groups could hardly be distinguished, the former did not like to be equated with the latter. Hence, the Kolis of Mahikanta were possibly in a kind of transitional stage between the status of Bhil and that of Koli.

The above point indicates that the status of 'Koli' had become a respectable one for those tribal groups in Gujarat who sought to distinguish themselves from the larger mass of their kinsmen. The Kolis seem to have attained an important sociopolitical status by the fourteenth century, at least on Konkan coast. A Koli kingdom is known to have been founded by Jayba Popera in North Konkan in 1348 (Roy 1983:29). The chief of the celebrated Janjira fort was a Koli named Ram Patil in the time of Shivaji (Deopujari 1973:263). Kolis had served the Maratha army since the time of Shivaji and exercised considerable control over the Konkan coast (ibid.). The Bahmanis conferred the rank of Sardar on Koli chiefs who held charge of hill tracts (ibid.).

In contrast, we have noted that the Kolis of Gujarat were mostly perceived as a 'predatory tribe'. From the way they are described in the literature of the medieval period and in travellers' accounts, we suspect that some descendants of medieval Bhil chiefs, particularly those of Ahmedabad, could have claimed the status of Koli.

Their occupations alternated between the seasonal practice of shifting cultivation and hunting while indulging in brigandry during the rest of the year. We recall Fred Crick Barth's discussion on ethnic boundaries among the Pathans of Swat in the context of 'our' Bhils and Kolis of medieval Gujarat. If the Pathans of Swat could change their identity (Barth 1959: 30) and those Rabaris serving the Rajput dynastics preferred to call themselves Raika to distinguish themselves socially (Srivastava 1997), could not some of the descendants of the Bhils have claimed the status of Koli for themselves in medieval times?

The same group of people with unchanged values and ideas would surely pursue different patterns of life and institutionalize different forms of behaviour, when faced with the different opportunities offered in different environments. Likewise, we must expect to find that one ethnic group, spread over a territory with varying ecologic circumstances, will exhibit regional diversities of overt institutionalized behaviour which do not reflect differences in cultural orientation (Kuper 1981:201).

A point of comparison can perhaps be made with Archana Prasad's study (2003) of the Gonds and Baigas of central India between the Maratha and the colonial periods. There the Raj Gonds or the zamindar Gonds tried hard to achieve upward mobility among the Rajput and Muslim rulers.

# **Concluding Observations**

We have outlined some historical processes through which the Bhils of western India developed their livelihood, adapting to different ecological, economic and political conditions. These processes resulted in the emergence of elite among the Bhils, accelerating stratification and marginalization within the community. For instance, there were the Solanki Bhil chiefs of Oghna as against the rest of the Bhils there. On the other hand, the state of Dungarpur seems to have maintained a social distance from the Bhils of that locality through careful military control. Our evidence points to similar processes of interactions between the Caulukyan state and the Bhils of the Ahmedabad locality and the Panchmahals. The fact that the Bhils played a significant role in the Caulukyan state is evident in the title of Jayasimha, *Barbaraka Jisnu*. If economic reasons were important for the Caulukyan state to initiate the process of 'peasantization' in the tribal locality of Ahmedabad (Kochharba), strategic reasons were equally important in initiating an alliance with the Bhils of the Panchamahals. The latter turned out to be an indispensable militia and forest guard force, while the Bhils of Ratanpur supplied agate and carnelian from the local mines. Although the Bhils of the Ahmedabad locality initially seem to have resisted the process of 'peasantizations', royal temples were likely to have set in motion a limited process of acculturation. Consequently, the possibility that some of the Bhil chiefs of Ahmedabad claimed the status of 'Koli' in the medieval period to distinguish themselves from their brethren cannot be ignored. The process of acculturation, 'peasantization' and the changing worldviews of the Bhils of western India during the medieval period were undoubtedly the natural consequences of

the processes of state formation and the growth of rural society at regional levels. Hence, generalizations about the Bhils need to be reviewed, and specific case studies, in the historical context, are essential to distinguish the Bhils of one region from another.
