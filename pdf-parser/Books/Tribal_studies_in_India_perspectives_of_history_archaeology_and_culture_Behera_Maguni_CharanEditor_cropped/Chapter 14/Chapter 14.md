**Abstract** This chapter critically investigates the continuity and changes in tribal worldview pertaining to witchcraft belief. It also attempts to give a systematic understanding and a contextual theory for the Indian context keeping in perspective the current ethnographic research and findings on witchcraft especially with reference to Nagaland and Jharkhand. Significantly, the chapter studies phenomenological aspect of the practice, but not its rationality. At the core of the chapter lies the analysis of witchcraft in tandem with magic—both as belief system and theory, and a characteristic view of the world not an epiphenomenon seen through the lens of factors like rationality, gender, disenfranchisement, land alienation and so on.

## **Introduction**

On 6 January 2014, in Umedanda village under Burmu Police Station in Ranchi district, three men armed with axe, cleaver and sword broke their neighbour's door open and hacked an elderly couple to death while seriously injuring the daughter-inlaw. For almost a year, I had been following on witchcraft-related killings in Jharkhand; and so a month later, I interviewed those close relatives affected by the macabre incident. It was found out that the deceased was the uncle of the three accused. The three brothers had killed the couple on charges of witchcraft when a young boy passed away in the middle of the night after a short bout of illness, the

symptom of which was attributed to malaria by some informants. The horrific incident followed the death of a second child in the extended family, because even in the death of the first child the three brothers had suspected the hand of their uncle. As expected, one of the accused wives vehemently denied any motive of witchcraft, which she said is blind faith and superstition. Interestingly, the incident had happened in a village with a higher literacy rate of 73.80% as compared to 66.41% of the state according to the 2011 census. Also those involved in the incident were caste-Hindus; however, the case study did not differ much from those carried out in the tribal hamlets. The case study aimed to support a well-established hypothesis that behind the tradition of witchcraft lurk far important sociocultural processes like patriarchy, property dispute, familial jealousy, blind faith, etc.

Witchcraft in India has a long history. With respect to the caste societies, David Mandelbaum (1966) had observed the long-held symbiotic relationship between Brahmanical priests and local magicians in catering to the devotees and seekers. Also the colonial political agents and Christian missionaries (Boding 1940) had first reported the prevalence of witchcraft in tribal communities.1 However, in recent years witchcraft has generated interest not for its belief and practice per se; but the heinous act of witch-hunt has propelled social scientists and social workers to study it in droves. Most of the witchcraft studies in India suggest gender inequality, patriarchy, property disputes, land alienation and closed community politics as the main bases of witchcraft (see Chaudhuri 1981; Barman 2002; Kelkar and Nathan 1991; Mishra 2003 and Nathan et al. 1998). However, in most of the studies conducted on witchcraft, the analysis of witch-hunt seems to be the controlling narrative.2

Generally, witchcraft studies in India are conducted in tribal societies. This is understandable because the classic ethnographic works on magic, sorcery and witchcraft have been carried out predominantly in small-scale tribal societies (Fortune 1932; Evans-Pritchard 1937; Kluckholn 1944; Crawford 1967). Also owing to the severity of witchcraft-related killings in the tribal inhabited pockets of Assam, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal, the perception of witchcraft as a tribal malady has intensified. For instance, the National Crime Record Bureau reports that Jharkhand accounts for the highest witchcraft-related killings with 56 deaths reported in 2013 alone. But at least during my fieldwork in rural Himachal Pradesh in a caste village, what I had observed is that witchcraft belief is woven into the daily social life. Moreover, the belief in sympathetic magic, evil eye and witchcraft, is much prevalent across states like Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Therefore, what separates the notion of witchcraft in tribal societies from the caste communities? What separates a *gur* (medium) in

<sup>1</sup>The British administrator-ethnographers like J.H. Hutton, J.P. Mills and T.C. Hodson and American missionaries like E.W. Clark and B.I. Anderson had reported witchcraft beliefs among the tribes of North East India; meanwhile, colonial officials like Dalton and W.G. Archer and European missionaries like Boding and Hoffman had published reports on the prevalence of witchcraft among the tribes in central and eastern part of India.

upper Himachal Pradesh from an Angami Naga necromancer or a Saora *kuranmaran* (shaman)? Is there a difference between an Idu Mishmi fearing an Adi shaman and an upper caste fearing a lower caste witchdoctor? Or how does one differentiate a high priest of a village *devta* from that of tribal priests like a Sumi *awou*, an Angami *kemovo*, an Adi *miri,* a Gond *panda*, a Munda *pahan*, a Hill Reddi *veju*, etc. who occupy similar position and perform critical rituals.

There has been a sweeping generalization about witchcraft without actually even defining it. This lack of attempt in definition exacerbates the problem of conceptualization because there is certainly a difference between what scholars in the European context call as *maleficia;* which is popularly known as black magic in India; and sorcery involving some sort of formal knowledge on rites; spells and divination; and in some cases involving apprenticeship like among the Santhals. In Europe, as Stark observes witchcraft was distinguished basing on the 'fundamental activities' such as magic, sorcery and satanism (Stark 2003: 205). However, in the Indian context, the epistemology of witchcraft is relegated to the backseat; meanwhile, its ramification takes precedence. Also another important factor is that the European witchcraft model cannot be replicated in India because as Stark (2003: 206) puts: 'Satanism was the essence of European witchcraft and the grounds for imposing the death penalty'. The concept of satan is an invention of monotheistic religions, and the religious beliefs of Indian tribes are far from being monotheistic in character. Among the Indian tribes, there is no concept of satan—a personified diabolical being. Rather, the cosmology is a primacy of spirits. According to their worldview, the intervention of these spirits causes illness and brings misfortunes and importantly makes people diviners and mediums. Therefore, there are methodological lacunae if one has to apply the European witchcraft and witch-hunt model in the Indian context.

Belief in witchcraft is often related with backwardness, primitiveness and superstitious proclivity of tribal societies. But belief in witchcraft is not a tribal idiosyncrasy, it is a pan-Indian phenomenon. Most of the witchcraft-related studies in India are seen through the lens of scapegoat induced by marginalization, patriarchy, sexism, etc. Here the social inequalities and power disparity are seen as the underlying causes of witchcraft beliefs and practices, more so witchcraft-related violence (see Saletore 1981; Bleie 1985 and Sundar 1998). The Indian tribal scene is diverse, but most tribal societies have some form of belief in magic and witchcraft. And ethnographic studies corroborate that such beliefs are deeply rooted in the religious tradition. Witchcraft is a belief system, more precisely—a view of the world.

The main focus of this paper is not to correlate witchcraft with other social and economic variables, but a description on witchcraft as a belief system. There are shared similarities in witchcraft as belief system irrespective of tribes and castes; but the conception of supernatural forces among the tribes lends a distinctive narrative and perspective on witchcraft. Thus drawing from the ethnographic studies, I will emphasize the beliefs and practices of witchcraft among the Indian tribes. In this paper, an attempt is made to address the methodological dilemma of representation, explore relevant theoretical perspectives, and highlight the issue of social change.

### **On Witchcraft and Representation**

Drawing on psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut's 'experience-near' and 'experiencedistant' concepts, Clifford Geertz (1973: 57) addresses the pervasive dilemma of representation in social sciences, more so in ethnography. According to Geertz, 'experience-near' concepts reflect the informants' phenomenological experience and the interpretation of reality shared in common as a group, while the 'experiencedistant' concepts are employed by specialists—in this case social scientists—to advance their hypothesis and findings. Thus, as Geertz puts, notions like 'love', 'fear' and 'nirvana' are 'experience-near', while concepts like 'religious system' and 'social-stratification' are 'experience-distant'. He argues that 'confinement to experience-near concepts' immerses researchers in immediacies and vernaculars, while 'confinement to experience-distant concepts' inordinately predisposes researchers to abstractions and jargons. This further reflects the tension inherent in anthropological discourses on belief system. What Geertz enunciates is the vexing issue of relativism versus scientism that confronts social science researches. This dichotomy is visible in witchcraft study in India. On one hand the social workers, NGOs and state-funded organizations have swerved toward the approach of scientism denying any sort of belief system known as witchcraft, although the longheld tradition of the communities tell otherwise, meanwhile subsuming witchcraft under the paradigm of superstition and lack of western scientific temper, while social researchers tend to describe witchcraft in context focusing inordinately on personal narratives and subjective experiences without systematic methodology and theorization. This complexity at least in social sciences is due to the fact that a phenomenon like witchcraft cannot be quantified or be subjected to scientific scrutiny. Thus academic endeavour so far has been toothless in alleviating the ills of witchhunt; meanwhile, social workers have not been able to dissuade communities from what they presume to be a deviant behaviour. Scores of ethnographic studies have established that witchcraft is not a form of deviance at least to those believing in it; rather it coheres with their perception of reality. Witchcraft is deeply embedded in people's view of the world; and this makes it more difficult to analyse objectively and give a cross-cultural understanding.

Consistent with Geertz's distinction, belief in witchcraft is an experience-near concept; and analysis of witchcraft is an experience-distant concept. The question of representation vexes most sociocultural researches; but the perplexity increases manifold in the investigation of experience-near concepts dealing with belief system. There are also conceptual difficulties since anthropologists like Rodney Needham (1972) deny a cognitive state that can be called as religious belief—in other words, a cross-comparative belief system in the supernatural. But in the Indian context, the distinction between experience-near and experience-distant concepts is augmented more sharply at the level of the researcher and the researched. Here researchers tend to see witchcraft as epiphenomena contingent on other social and cultural variables. This approach engenders a condition where the analysis of witchcraft becomes a means to an end. It creates phenomenological dissonance between those believing in witchcraft and those claiming to represent them. Witchcraft is a belief system; and witch-hunt is but a small fragment of this system, and therefore, the neurosis and travails of witch-hunting cannot be taken as a point of reference to understand this complex cultural system, as is mostly attempted in the Indian context.

Geertz sees these heuristic concepts in varying degrees, in other words as a spectrum. However, what he did not emphasize are the phenomenological parameters involved in the employment of these concepts, which evinces the intersubjectivity inherent in the description of the social processes. Thus, for instance, a native researcher socialized in a particular tradition and a non-native expert describing a phenomenon like witchcraft would have substantial conceptual variances. The phenomenological dimension of a concept like witchcraft affords a varying degree of subjectivity; and this has generated multiple perspectives on witchcraft. The argument is not so much on how natives perceive witchcraft but on how the researchers are placed in the phenomenological spectrum of discerning and conceptualising witchcraft.

The epistemological variance has generated a great deal of theoretical approaches on witchcraft. However, if one delves into the Indian social life, the belief in magic and witchcraft is a common phenomenon, and the cross-comparative study would reveal shared similarities across caste and tribe boundaries. But the dilemma pertains to layers of realities faced in the fieldwork situation. The denial of culpability in witchcraft belief is common in most cases of witch-hunt. Meanwhile, the folklore, religious beliefs and ritual practices would be awash with themes and symbolism of witchcraft. Here what people believe and say present conflicting perspectives. Also the positionality of the researcher in all its complexities determines the nature of social interaction and the type of data generated during the research process. Thus most studies on witchcraft afford an approximation of the social reality. The quantification of variables and statistical models at best evince a facet of the subject matter, but not the entire picture. In this context, Veena Das (1977: 2–5) observes that the enquiry on observable behaviour while overlooking the prevalent ideas will narrow the scope of social science enquiry. This hidden feature of belief system makes a study like witchcraft more precarious and open to interpretations. However, this dilemma has somehow been mitigated by Evans-Pritchard in his study of the Azande witchcraft (Evans-Pritchard 1937). As Mary Douglas puts, the premise with which Evans-Pritchard begins is: 'what sustains Azande beliefs in oracles, what gives oracles credibility in the first place?' Douglas answers that like in any belief system, it is 'an array of fundamental assumptions that are never visible to the people who make them'—in other words, the worldview of the people (Douglas 1980: 50). Witchcraft belief is in the realm of worldview; and what researchers can do at best is give an interpretation of people's view of the world. Here I will put emphasis on Durkheimian conceptual categories to enunciate people's view on the nature of reality and their interaction with the supernatural to understand witchcraft.

### *Weltanschauung* **(Worldview) and Witchcraft**

Whether it is a Santhal myth about the earth resting on a back of a tortoise, thus rationalizing earthquakes (Bahr 2005: 16), or an Ao myth of origin from 6 (six) stones at Longterok impacting matrimonial rules and kinship ties (Mills 1926), or a Munda myth about a bird hatching the first human (Roy 1912/1972: 328), or a Sumi legend telling about men learning ritual complex from the spirits, all these myths and stories rationalize the human condition and explain why the world is what it is. The idea of causality is inherent in all these myths and legends. These stories may encounter the people as real, mythical, metaphorical or symbolic; but their potentiality lies in the world-building activity where the exigencies of daily social life are given meaning and rationalized (Berger 1969). Thus despite the nuanced interpretations, this genre of stories accentuates the idea of first cause: Why there is evil? Why do maleficent forces cause mischief? Why only women are witches? Such existential questions are pervasive in tribal societies, and these explanatory processes form a pivotal part of tribal folklore. For instance, a popular story told by the tribes in Jharkhand on the nature of man, spirit and environment establishes the idea of causality.3

Long ago there lived an ancient group of people known as Asurs, who were iron smelters. The Asurs worked day and night in their furnace without rest, thereby sullying the environment. Thus people went to the almighty god, *Sing Bonga*, requesting him to intervene. *Sing Bonga* sent the animals as messengers to the Asurs to consider, but to no avail. So he incarnated himself as a young boy covered with scabs and boils on his body. And he hatched a plan and sabotaged the furnace. The Asurs went to a *deora* (religious specialist) to determine the cause of the furnace breakdown. The *deora* forecasted that a human sacrifice was imperative to get the furnace working. So the Asurs searched for a sacrificial victim; and *Sing Bonga* volunteered for the role. *Sing Bonga* entered the furnace and after 7 days and seven nights emerged with a divine radiance bedecked with jewels and ornaments. The Asur men enticed by *Sing Bonga's* appearance jumped into the furnace and were incinerated. *Sing Bonga* then returned to his original form and readied to leave for the heavens. The Asur women did not want him to leave, and so they caught hold of his legs. *Sing Bonga* then shook them off vigorously; and the Asur women scattered all over the place: some fell into a well and became a well spirit, some fell on a hill and became a hill spirit, some fell into the jungle and became a jungle spirit, and so forth.

The significance of folklore is not on the objective statements or the veracity of the claim—which some lamentably attempt; but folklores are also nomizing activities (Berger 1969: 29–30) where the individuals as members of social group understand and explain the questions of life, death, evil, suffering and the quest for the

supernatural.4 The idea of first cause can lead to tautological reasoning. But the notion of ultimate reality, the idea of first cause, plays a significant role in shaping beliefs. Thus the notion of maleficia, sorcery and witchcraft in tribal societies are not mere by-products of other social and economic processes; rather their distinctive characteristics are rooted in the idea of the first cause. This can explain why witchcraft is prevalent in tribal societies in the first place. Thus if central Indian tribes believe in the potency of witchcraft, or if a Konyak, Sangtam or a Yimchunger Naga believes in nefarious practice of poisoning and evil eye, these are real threats which exist since the cosmological belief renders them possible in the first place.

The notion of first cause in monotheistic religion can be extrapolated to understand the issue better. For instance, if Christians and Muslims believe in an omnipotent god who created the heaven and earth, then the believers would have no difficulty believing in virgin birth or in the revelation of prophet Muhammad on a winged horse trip to Jerusalem (see Armstrong 1993 and Stark 2007). Similarly, witchcraft is not an arbitrary belief but is located in the idea of the first cause. The notion of first cause may be rooted in myths, legends or a localized pantheon. But this can explain the pervasiveness of belief in magic and witchcraft in tribal societies, and therefore it cannot be reduced to a dependent variable of other social and cultural processes. The argument is that individuals may be indicted as witches with an ulterior motive rendered by personal enmity, land grabbing, gender discrimination, etc. But witchcraft is not necessarily an outcome of these social processes, since the inequalities and discrimination in various forms exists in all societies. However, the existence of social and economic inequalities in tribal societies is given a characteristic expression through witchcraft belief and practice, since the worldview of the people render it possible in the first place. The origin of witchcraft is difficult to establish in tribal societies, which has confounded researchers; but the oral tradition of the tribals establishes the idea of first cause through myths, legends and stories, which explains the origin of witchcraft.

The notion of causality owes to what Emile Durkheim calls as 'category of thought' (Durkheim and Mauss 1903/1963 and Durkheim 1912/1995). According to Durkheim the notions of time and space; self and others; and class and causality are universal to every human society. And it is through these conceptual categories that people comprehend and understand the nature of reality. This is a significant contribution because these categories help in the idea of classification inherent in every social group. In every society, the notion of the self and other helps in conceptualizing the idea of supernatural; men and spirits; and belief and disbelief. Here the very idea of magic, sorcery and witchcraft hinges on the notion of the self and other, a worldview universal (Redfield 1953; Kearney 1984).

The tribes share many similar beliefs in magic and witchcraft. This is a distinctive feature because Indian tribes tend to show immense diversity in terms of culture, language, livelihood, geographical distribution and the nature of interaction

<sup>4</sup>Peter Berger argues that humans need a structuring nomos, which provides them with predictability, social stability, and a coherent view of the world to live in. He calls this processes nomization, the function of which makes society indispensable to humans.

with other dominant cultures. There are significant cultural differences even within the same geographical region. For example, the sun which occupies a vital space in the tribal imagination and cosmology is perceived differently across the tribal groups in North East India. As such among the Tani group of tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, the sun is personified as a supreme being (Chaudhuri 2013),5 while among the Naga tribes the sun is not deemed invincible since the tiger can gobble it up, which they believe is the cause of solar eclipse. But irrespective of differing cultural beliefs and practices, the shared belief in magic and witchcraft transcends cultural and geographical boundaries.

According to Kearney (1984: 41), 'worldview comprises of images of self and all that is recognized as non-self, plus ideas about relationship between them'. He classifies the supernatural beings within the domain of 'non-self' or other identifying it as a mode of conceptualization. Here the supernatural entities are not merely a subject of awe and reverence; but it helps the individuals and social groups in conceptualizing and classifying subjective experiences, supernaturalism, the immensity of nature and the capriciousness of human existence. Thus phenomena like magic and witchcraft not only reflect the inexorable positioning of the self and other; but it is also a system of finding answers to life's questions and quest for meaning which is a universal human pursuit. Thus the boundary between religion and magic remains blurred in tribal societies because the belief system is embedded in the exigencies and immediacies of social life.

The idea of an almighty creator is pervasive in tribal religious belief. This almighty creator is known by many names: the Konyak call it *Gawang*; the Saora call it *Kittung*; the Munda call it *Sing Bonga*; the Angami call it *Kenopfu*; the Oraon call it *Dharmes*; and so on. The characteristic feature that unites all these creators is their aloof and detached disposition. In other words, these gods are deistic figures. They do not interfere in the daily affairs of the people. They are insignificant in the dynamics of witchcraft belief and practices. Rather, it is the active spirits that impacts the witchcraft beliefs. These spirits, which are part of the daily life, are known for their capricious nature; they are constantly propitiated, revered and feared for their various characteristics.6

The demarcating feature about tribal religious belief is that the gods are not an epitome of morality unlike in the world religions, especially monotheism, where the omnipotent god is taken as a source of goodness and justice. In the tribal worldview, the gods are amoral beings; and as folklores demonstrate, they are liable to cheat, lie and connive and can be fickle toward its adherents. This has a huge implication on

<sup>5</sup>Donyi-Poloism or Donyi-Polo literally meaning 'sun' and 'moon' is an indigenous religious revitalization movement in Arunachal Pradesh. Basing on my fieldwork in Nagaland, I have used the symbolism of sun as a cross-comparative analysis to argue my case, although the term 'Donyi-Polo' is understood more as a single concept.

<sup>6</sup> In most tribal societies, the ritual complex is directed toward the classes of spirits, which are categorized as benevolent and malevolent spirits. However, both the types of spirits are characterized by their capricious nature, since the so-called benevolent spirits can also turn rogue if they are not propitiated in the right time. Also in most tribal societies, the rituals and sacredness attributed to the creator god is not elaborated and well established.

the concept of evil, since the notion of evil is not clearly defined in the tribal folk narratives. Here what may be considered as a source of evil is believed to be a conscious creation of a creator god. For instance, according to Mac-Machado (2010: 192–93), the Vasava Bhil narrates that the god who created humans also created witches (*dakans*) with sickle-shaped horns; but the horns were transferred to *dudhkuvad* (*Wrightia tinctoria*) tree when the *dakans* 'pleaded for a normal human look'. The Mundas narrate that the *deora* were appointed by *Sing Bonga* to identify types of spirits so as to ascertain the nature of propitiation, which has to be performed. This creates inconsistencies in the conception of evil since witchcraft is considered bad, harmful and maleficent, but not necessarily evil, because witchcraft is not understood within the religious dichotomy of good and evil in tribal communities. Just as the spirits can be either benevolent or malevolent; so also are human actions which can be deemed as either benevolent or malevolent in a relational aspect. This is similar to the perception of adultery, homicide and theft as an infraction of customary laws and traditions and thus a peril to social stability, but not necessarily a transgression of god given moral laws.

The term magico-religious acts and belief (Goody 1961) has become pejorative due to its implicit evolutionary assumption. The term is associated with a Eurocentric view of grading human societies on the basis of magic, religion and science. However, ethnographers studying tribal societies have identified two important aspects of belief in the supernatural forces: the first involves coercion, persuasion and forceful manipulation of supernatural powers to achieve a desired goal for either altruistic or harmful purposes, while the second involves acts of worshipping, propitiation or oblation of supernatural beings. The first type is usually named as magical act, while the second type is named as religious act, hence the term magicoreligious beliefs and practices. In reality this dichotomy is hard to maintain because the two often overlaps owing to multiplicity of beliefs and the classes of spirits that exists in tribal societies. Let me illustrate with my ethnographic study among the Sumi tribe of Nagaland to understand the classes of supernatural beings as narrated by the community.

The three classes of spirits in the Sumi pantheon are *alhou*, *kungumi* and *aghau* (see also Hutton 1921: 191–193); however, if the functionality of magico-religious beliefs and practices is to be understood, it is only *aghau*, which are actively involved in the daily affairs of humans. The second class of spirit is the almighty god *alhou*, the creator of the heaven and earth, albeit his indifference toward his creation makes him irrelevant in the daily human affairs. Beside the story of his involvement in creation, there are no critical rituals, taboos or fear associated with *alhou*. The third type of spirits is *kungumi* (heavenly beings), found only in myths and legends. This class of spirits is relegated to mere storytelling and therefore has no implication in the belief of the people. *Kungumi* are similar to village spirits called *pat* among the Oraon or a defunct Munda witch-finder deity *Sing Bonga's* elder brother that have fallen into disuse. *Kungumi* in Sumi folklore are understood as heavenly beings with physical bodies having human emotions and desires.

*Aghau* is an inclusive term for the spirits actively involved in day-to-day life of the people. It is in principle a broad classification of various kinds of spirits giving heartbeat to the experiential aspect of religious life. These spirits are believed to be capricious, fickle and most importantly amoral. Thus their worship and propitiation form a magico-religious complex. This similar class of spirits, albeit with different characteristics, manifestations and dominance, are found across most tribal societies. Interestingly, the spirits believed to be responsible for witchcraft are not well defined rather they are open to interpretations and conflicting narratives. This does not imply that people are oblivious to their nature; but unlike other spirits like house spirit, ancestral spirit, river spirit, hill spirit, village spirit, etc. which have a specific role and manifestation, the spirits attributed to witchcraft are marked by ambiguity, esotericism and incomprehensibility. This is prominently reflected in people's perception about this much-dreaded practice, which is veiled in obscurity.

### **Witchcraft as Belief System**

The imputation of supernatural powers on the agents of witchcraft is complex and inconsistent. Thus witches are indicted on a bewildering array of interpretations. For instance, witches can take the form of a cat or an owl and visit victims at night for maleficent purposes; witches can poison others either directly or indirectly; witches can give supernatural injuries to others using malefic invisible arrows; the pernicious breath of witches can cause harm to people, animals and even orchards and agricultural fields; witches have the power to harm others through the utterance of words; and witches have the power to cause death and diseases and can even kill plants and animals with their evil sight.

Among the southern Naga tribes of Nagaland like Angami, Chakhesang and Sumi, there exists a belief in witches who poison others. Mostly women have been accused of this nefarious practice and meted out the worst form of punishment, which is expulsion from the village, since there is no concept of capital punishment. But the charges are based mostly on hearsay and oral tradition since there are no religious specialists to forecast the person responsible for the act. The perplexity is that those accused vehemently deny their involvement in witchcraft. Also there is difficulty in ascertaining the nature and source of this dreadful practice. People give various explanations mostly substantiated with stories and happenings in the community; but there is no consensus. Some tell that poisoning is a form of fertility practice where witches propitiate the spirits for bumper harvest in the *jhum* field; some believe that the practitioners of this maleficent art have secret societies and also have a system of apprenticeship; some believe that witchcraft is hereditary, the power of which is passed on to immediate kin members; and some believe that some people by nature are inherently evil and cause harm to others. Interestingly, the belief in Lazami, a southern Sumi Naga village, is that the witches have episodic itching of the hand, which must be satiated. Thus they will satiate their fiendish nature by giving poison to even coveted animals and fruit trees, if they don't find a human victim. It is also difficult to ascertain how the poison is harnessed, as some believe that a kind of concoction is used; some think that it is inherent; and some

believe that the diabolic spirits give power to the witches.7 These beliefs are compounded with the bizarre imageries, which are attributed to the witches. In Ighanumi village, another southern Sumi village, some women respondents narrated how witches in the past would prostrate naked before a gigantic cane basket used for storing paddy, while foamy matters would effervesce from the cane basket. This is similar to popular conceptions about witches exhibiting strange behaviour and indulging in strange rituals like stripping off naked and dancing; performing human and animal sacrifice; using effigies to harm others; and conducting rituals at graveyards at midnight (see Murray 1921; Summers 1926/1927; Russell 1972/1991).

The spatial location of spirits in the tribal worldview has no clear demarcation between this world and the next. Among the Indian tribes, there is no concept of heaven and hell. In the world religions, the eschatology of afterlife is well established where the souls or spirits are believed to depart for the next world or are reincarnated as in Buddhism and Hinduism. But among most Indian tribes such as the Birhor, Ho, Khasi, Oraon and Santhal, who have strong belief in the ancestral spirits, the spatial location between 'this life' and the 'afterlife' is a continuum. Most tribes believe that the spirits of kin members continue their existence in this world even after their demise. This belief is reflected in the practice of sacred groves, inviting the spirits of dead relatives back into the homes and identifying certain locations as the abode of spirits. This permanence of spirits is found even among the Naga tribes who have the concept of the 'land of the dead', a place where the dead lives for permanently. The belief is that in cases such as accidental deaths, stillbirths and suicide, which are considered an oddity, such human spirits are believed to be inauspicious and thus wander in this world aimlessly. This capricious nature of spirits can be exemplified in the mortuary practices of the Oraon tribe. The Oraon consider accidental deaths to be inauspicious; and thus proper death ritual is not afforded in case of such deaths. For instance, the body is kept outside the house in the courtyard. The burials in this case are exceedingly simple, and after the ceremony is over, the spirits are led to a large tree and left there instead of bringing them home, as is the customary practice. Thus such abodes like a banyan tree become not only a subject of legendary stories about encountering ghosts and spirits but are also set apart as sinister and foreboding. This is a significant perception of space, which separates tribes from the mainstream communities.

Belief in witchcraft is contextual and is influenced by numerous variables. However, one of the least discussed is the positioning of the self and other inherence in the witchcraft belief system. The nature of relationship between the self and the supernatural other can throw light to the understanding of witchcraft. In tribal societies, the relationship between humans and spirits is characterized by a market-like situation where complete submission and servitude to the supernatural beings are evidently absent. This creates a condition where distrust and scepticism enter the course of transaction. In this context, Stark and Bainbridge (1996: 36–39) aptly

<sup>7</sup>To establish how some people become witches and derive their supernatural power is contentious, because despite the belief in its prevalence, the epistemology of witchcraft is not well developed among the Naga tribes.

define religion as 'systems of general compensators based on supernatural assumptions'. According to them, compensators are postulated 'rewards or cluster of rewards' that define the nature of relationship between humans and supernatural beings. The pursuit for reward is more immediate in the context of tribal religions, as coercion and controlling of supernatural forces take precedence during rites and rituals. The key factor here is submission. The more submissive the self is to the supernatural other, the lesser the intensity in witchcraft belief and practices. Submission is not only an act of servitude; but it is an acknowledgement of the authority and power of the supernatural being. Here the gods are seen as the ultimate source of power and authority that humans cannot measure up to. Witchcraft is not merely a system of coercing and harnessing the supernatural powers; but it is predicated upon the differential notion of power and supremacy of the supernatural other. The submissiveness to the supernatural other can be understood as a spectrum where monotheism and tribal religion occupy the extreme ends. This does not imply that monotheistic religions are devoid of witchcraft beliefs; but such belief does not take the centre stage of the religious life and worldview. While on the other hand, belief in magic and witchcraft plays a significant role and occupies a vital space in the tribal cosmology and religious life.

The notion of submissiveness is concomitant with the idea of guardianship and protection of the supernatural beings. This is more conspicuous in monotheism, but even in Hinduism, the idea is much prevalent. For instance, in upper Himachal Pradesh, the folk religious belief is a primacy of village godlings and other supernatural forces. Thus belief in magic and witchcraft is a part of daily social life. Here the village *devtas* or godlings are experiential, relatively tangible and actively involved in the daily life of the people through the mediums. But more importantly the godlings are considered to be the ultimate protector of those within their jurisdiction. This is a two-way process because for their benevolence and protection, the godlings demand utmost devotion and allegiance from the adherents, which is reflected in the elaborate rituals, dietary habits and constant worship. The godlings, which are actively involved in people's life, are considered to be more powerful than the malevolent spirits, thus mitigating the effects of witchcraft and black magic practices in the community. This does not imply that the belief in guardian spirit is absent in tribal communities; but the belief system and power pertaining to such spirits is not well defined. Thus the ascendancy of the supernatural beings over humans is differentially reflected in the intensity of witchcraft beliefs and practices among different social groups.

### **On Witchcraft and Theory of Magic**

Broadly speaking, the concept of witchcraft can be subsumed under the theory of magic, although the definition of magic, like religion, remains a point of contention. Be that as it may, most scholars agree that magic involves the manipulation or coercion of supernatural forces to achieve this—worldly goals and motivations (Frazer

1922/1976).There is a consensus that the conception of 'impersonal power' separates magic from religion (Malinowski 1948; Benedict 1938; Radin 1937/1957). These impersonal and supernatural forces are subjected to mechanistic manipulations unlike in religion where the idea of supernatural beings with consciousness and desire takes precedence (Stark 2001). Thus the basic idea is that magical acts involve compulsion, not supplication. This element of compulsion has been an important point of departure for scholars distinguishing magic from religion (Weber 1922/1993: 28). The supernatural forces deemed responsible for magic remains vague in most context, as Malinowski (1948: 19) put it, the supernatural entity in magic is a 'mystic, impersonal power'. But the relationship of humans with these supernatural forces engenders classes of religious specialists and practitioners. Marcel Mauss (1972/2005: 23) identifies three elements in magic as actions, representations and officers, which he calls as magicians. Malinowski (1935, 1948) elaborated these elements in his theory of magic as spells used, sequence of symbolic acts, and moral condition of the performer. Both identify ritual specialists basing on their status and role; but the classification of sacred specialists based on the types of magic performed remains unclear. Here I will broadly classify the ritual technicians and sacred specialists basing on the types of magic performed as found among the Indian tribes.

Magic among the tribes is resorted to as precautionary act, therapeutic action and a system of divination. Both the laity and specialists can have access to magic as precautionary act and therapeutic action. However, the former does not possess all forms of knowledge pertaining to these two types of magic. If all magical knowledge becomes accessible in the public space, then there would be no need for ritual technicians and sacred specialists, because the critical factor in their role as specialists is the possession of private knowledge, which sets them apart from the laity. Before proceeding to the role of sacred specialists, let me illustrate the recurrence of magic as precautionary and therapeutic acts. First, magic as precautionary actions can be associated with fertility belief and preventive rituals to ward off illnesses and an overall pursuit of well-being and quality of life—both as individuals and as social groups. For instance, this type of magic is pervasive among the tribes practicing *jhum* cultivation as livelihood where the entire agricultural cycle is marked by *gennas*, rituals and taboos. As such, the sacrificing of animals to the spirits for the success of the agricultural year is a case in point. Both the individuals and the specialists perform precautionary magic; but depending on the paramountcy of rituals, the magical acts become exclusive to the ritual technicians. For instance, the ritual specialists in Sumi society are classified according to the critical agricultural milestone where important rituals have to be performed. Thus, besides the chief priest (*awou*), there is the first sower (*atiquu*) and the first reaper (*amthau*) whose roles as ritual specialists mark an important phase in the agricultural endeavour. Usually priests in tribal societies, who perform vital rituals pertaining to economic livelihood and general well-being of the community, resort to rituals as precautionary magic, in addition to them being tradition keepers and repository of religious knowledge.

Therapeutic magic is not a preventive or a precautionary act. This magical act can also be called as crisis magic whose functionality comes into play when the individuals or the community is in the midst of crisis. This type of magic is performed when an individual is afflicted with illness, or in case of outbreak of animal diseases, or blighting of crops, or drought, or in case of an epidemic outbreak. Magic as therapeutic act plays a cathartic role and is believed to cure afflictions whether they are grounded in natural aetiology or attributed to supernatural forces. This type of magic is marked by immediacy and exigency of daily social life. It is resorted to when individuals not only seek a cure but also want to know the cause of their affliction. This is where the role of local medicine men, shamans and other traditional healers become pertinent.

Magic as a system of divination, in the Indian context is mostly associated with witchcraft and sorcery. The concept of reversal magic to thwart off the influence of witchcraft and black magic is not possible without involving the specialists who act as diviners. As Evans-Pritchard (1976: 66) observes, 'the Zande witch doctor is both diviner and magician. As diviner he exposes witches; as magician he thwarts them'. Here the concept of magic as divination and therapeutic action is inherent in the argument. The same process is observed among the religious specialists like *ojha* and *deora* among the tribes of Jharkhand who divines the identity of the witches and also offers their service as therapists performing rituals like *jharaphook* (spell blow) to ward off evil spirits. The most important aspect of magic as divination is that it is exclusively set apart from the laity unlike the other two types of magic where some form of knowledge is made accessible to the people. Belief in divination is rooted in people's worldview; but the significance of diviners is based on the idea of rarity and mystery. This is where the role of sacred specialists and ritual technicians become indispensable to the social group; for there will be no oracles and necromancers, if the knowledge of divination is in the public space. Magic as a system of divination is veiled in an aura of sacredness and secrecy. This aura of secrecy elevates witchcraft to the realm of supernatural where only an elect few can ascertain the cause and provide answer for its affliction. At the level of methodology, this notion of sacred knowledge and secrecy makes witchcraft steeped in subjectivity and hence difficult to understand and analyse objectively.

### **Witchcraft and Social Change**

The argument that modernity and scientific knowledge will diminish witchcraft beliefs and practices is overwhelmingly simple and therefore requires close attention and analysis. This sort of argument would lead to the fallacy of evolutionary argument of magic, religion and science. Belief in magic and witchcraft exists in varying degree in every society despite the advances of modern science and

technology. At least among the religious groups, the belief in witchcraft cuts across religious boundaries (see Shaw 1997; Danfulani 1999; Kapferer 2003). It is important to mention that people resorting to magic and witchcraft reveal the limitations of scientific and pragmatic knowledge. To recall Malinowski (1922), when Trobriand Islanders perform canoe-making magic or garden magic, it does not imply that they lack the technical know-how of canoe making or knowledge of horticulture and garden management. Why they perform magic is to minimize the risk of an unanticipated squall in an open sea or invoke the supernatural forces to bring rain in its right time, both of which are beyond human control and explanation. This similarity is found among the Indian tribes who occupy a wide spectrum of economic livelihood in diverse ecological zones, where magic and witchcraft practices reflect the allaying of fears and uncertainties of human existence. There are certain life's exigencies, which transcend the societal shift from tradition to modernity that scientific knowledge and procedure cannot explain, and these exigencies are responsible for the resilience and continuity of witchcraft beliefs. As Stark and Bainbridge (1996: 38) put it, when humans lack 'scientific means to achieve immortality, they can at best settle for compensators in the form of hopes for the life to come'.

To reiterate my argument, witchcraft is a matter of belief, to be more precise, a characteristic view of the world. According to Kearney, worldview changes when there are inconsistencies in the images and assumptions about the nature of reality, which brings about social and cultural changes. And there are two types of inconsistencies, which grapple any worldview, internal and external inconsistencies (Kearney 1984: 32). The external inconsistencies in worldview arise when the images and assumptions of people do not tally with the nature of reality. Among the tribes there has been a change in worldview owing to these inconsistencies especially based on the idea of cause and effect; but witchcraft belief does not necessarily adhere to the perceptibility of cause and effect, because the idea of cause and effect in witchcraft is a priori to observation and scientific explanation. It is an explanation of life's exigencies and a search for meaning which fails human comprehension.

By this it does not imply that belief in witchcraft would evade the forces of modernity and globalization. It can be predicted that the belief in witchcraft will intensify or lessen owing to differential social and cultural changes of the communities. However, one thing is certain that the process of change will vary from one tribal community to the other, just as religious conversion among Indian tribes have substantially differed from one community to the other. Here conversion is implied not as a change in identity but as a process of change in the belief system. Every conversion takes place at the level of subjective break and objective break (Travisano 1970). The objective break is much easier to ascertain since it is at the level of practices; but subjective break is at the level of beliefs; and thus change is more resilient and protracted. Witchcraft as a belief system is at the level of subjective break; and therefore the changes would be gradual, complex and arbitrary.

### **Concluding Remarks**

The belief in witchcraft among the Indian tribes has generated a great deal of academic interests; but most studies have relegated witchcraft to a dependent variable influenced by other social and cultural phenomena. Here the understanding of witchcraft from the perspective of gender seems to take precedence in both academic and popular discourse. Of course, the prevailing social reality substantiates gender discrimination and violence in witchcraft-related prejudices and killings. But on a close observation, witchcraft belief also significantly arises from the existential questions, the exigencies of life and the search for meaning common to all human societies. Therefore, to understand witchcraft purely as epiphenomena of other sociocultural processes would give us a parochial understanding of this complex phenomenon.

Also witchcraft beliefs and practices in India among diverse social groups show many similarities; but among the tribes, there are differences based on cultural and geographical zones, as ethnographic studies would reveal that the nature of witchcraft beliefs would vary among the tribes in the Himalayan belt, Chotanagpur-Santhal Parganas region, Nilgiri Hills, oceanic zone, etc. For instance, even among the tribes of the Himalayan belt, there will be difference in witchcraft practices between animist tribes and those tribes influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. This crosscultural study of witchcraft has not been attempted and therefore is much anticipated in the Indian context.
