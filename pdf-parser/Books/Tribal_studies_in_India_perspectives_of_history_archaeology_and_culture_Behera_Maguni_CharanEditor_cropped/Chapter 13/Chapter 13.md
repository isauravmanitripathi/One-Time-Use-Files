#### **Nilanjan Khatua**

**Abstract** This chapter presents a syncretic tradition of interaction between indigenous and other communities through museum exhibits. Indigenous cultures as diverse as they are, from primitive hunter-gatherers and pastoralists to industrial city dwellers and in terms of diverse life styles tribal, folk and urban, find a proper place in museum. The diversity is often depicted as an integrated pattern of culture in which all the varying forms of cultural life fit like pieces in a mosaic. But for an average Indian, it is difficult to visualize elements of unity in an apparently divergent cultural milieu spread over length and breadth of the country. Under such a situation, museums play a significant role by providing a platform for interaction and education of the society at large and by disseminating the knowledge of biological and cultural aspects of humankind from prehistoric to contemporary times. The discussion in this chapter depicts such a dynamic role of museums. Precisely, present chapter is an attempt to highlight the different dimensions of anthropological museum and how it is useful for envisaging and preserving the tribal culture and their heritage.

Tribal communities (also known as indigenous communities or First Nation) are tradition bound, displaying their age-old cultural tradition of diverse ways of life in various degrees in the face of changes. The phenomenon of diversity reflects in languages, economic pursuits and social organizations. In India itself, there are tribal groups speaking languages belonging to different language families, broadly under Dravidian, Aryan and Mongoloid families. These groups pursue a range of economic activities; on the basis of which they are grouped as hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, agriculturists and industrial city dwellers. There are number of cultural

traits which differ from one community to the other; and undoubtedly, it is not generally possible to perceive the diverse tribal culture in a field situation. For a common public, it is more difficult to envision and comprehend such a picture of diversity existing across the length and breadth of the country. But when the cultural diversity in terms of diverse cultural materials is sighted collectively in one place, it will be easy to see and comprehend the diversity. Herein lies the importance of an anthropological museum that serves this purpose of presenting and providing opportunity of comprehending the diversity in one place. The museum presents such diverse lifestyles of tribal communities of India in a small space for easy visualization and comprehension, for various regional cultural traits of different ethnic groups are properly displayed in the museum. The visitors to the museum are exposed to these diverse exhibits and develop a sense of their unity in Indian context. More significantly, when people see the reality about cultural diversity among Indian tribes, they develop a sense of appreciation to the way of life of different cultural groups in general, and the dichotomy of 'we' and 'other' disappears. In principle, the sense of appreciation to diversity stands in opposition to the feeling of ethnocentrism that lies at the root of 'we' and 'they' feelings.

A museum is simply known for its collections1 , more often as a place of collection of curiosities. There are different types of museums like anthropological museum, archaeological museum, art museum, natural history museum, science museum, history museum, personalia museum, folklore museum, medical museum and maritime museum, of which anthropological museum presents a general understanding of Indian culture and enhances the essence of comprehending India as a unit. Collections found in anthropological museums usually consist of palaeoanthropological evidences – fossil hominids, prehistoric tools and ethnographic objects2 . By and large, all anthropological museums have a rich collection of ethnographic objects collected from different ethnic groups/communities living in the country. It merits mention that ethnographic collections of anthropological museums significantly provide the visitors a space for appreciation and reflection on cultural heritage of various communities. These collections along with fossil hominids and prehistoric tools are educative to the society at large by way of disseminating the knowledge of biological and cultural aspects of humankind from prehistoric era to contemporary times.

India boasts 41 anthropological museums (see Jeyaraj 2005:43) spread over length and breadth of the country. As already mentioned, these museums in general create public awareness about the rich and diversified culture of our country and, this apart, present the contribution of each community in the process of building up the cultural heritage of India.

The present paper is an attempt to highlight different dimensions of anthropological museum and how it is useful in portraying and preserving the diversity of

tribal culture and their heritage. The premise of investigation is based on the fact that museums play a crucial role in promoting unity in the society. Generally museums use their available resources to ensure understanding and appreciation for the various groups and cultures that exist in a society. Therefore, in a country of diversity as is India, the importance of anthropological museums in the promotion of mutual understanding among various segments of the population; development of the sense of respect for other culture, language and religion; and the way of life in general in building sense of national integration cannot be underemphasized, particularly in the understanding of diversity in tribal cultures.

### **Materials and Methods**

The present paper is based on the experience gained from working mainly in two anthropological museums for a period of 17 years. The study of museum collections has proved useful to understand the diversity they represent in an objective manner. While writing the paper, various scholarly articles have been thoroughly examined and analysed in order to develop a critical understanding of anthropological museum and its importance in the public domain. Care has been taken to illustrate the theme of the paper with the help of museum collections while interpreting various aspects of tribal and folk culture. Two museums, namely, Zonal Anthropological Museum, Mysore, and National Museum of Mankind, Bhopal, were visited and studied in writing the present paper.

It is already discussed that anthropological museums are working in visualizing, preserving and revitalizing the cultures of different communities, particularly the vulnerable sections such as the tribal and the indigenous communities, as their ways of life are still tradition-bound to a large extent. In India, with the mention of the name Anthropological Museum, two museums instantly come to the mind. These museums are the National Museum of Mankind, formally known as Indira Gandhi Rashtriya Manav Sangrahalaya (IGRMS), Bhopal, established in the year 1979, and Zonal Anthropological Museums (ZAM), Mysore, which started functioning in the year 1965 under the aegis of Anthropological Survey of India. Needless to say, the popularity of these two museums was the yardstick of selecting them for the present investigation.

The importance of anthropological museums can be appreciated from the objectives of their establishment as is evident from the following paragraph:

In view of making people aware of the rich cultural traditions of Indian communities and to disseminate the bio-cultural heritage of the people, tribal groups, in particular, of our country, the Anthropological Survey of India established a chain of Anthropological Museums for its Head Office - Kolkata, and the Regional Offices situated at Dehradun, Udaipur, Nagpur, Shillong, Mysore, Port Blair, and Jagdalpur during the Fifth Five Year Plan (1975– 79). The idea behind establishing the 'Museum of Man' later known as 'Museum of Mankind' is to arouse an awareness of the need for the proper knowledge of national culture and tradition and to teach our people the salient features of the cultures of the neighbouring countries as well as of the different parts of the world. Museum of Man also expected to focus the attention on multifarious national problems. (Roy 1972:3)

These two institutions, IGRMS and ZAM, are constantly working among the communities and documenting their culture both in written and visual forms. Because of their committed engagement, they are in the right position to provide input into the development planning of the communities of Indian subcontinent. It is to be mentioned that there are curators/keepers of museum who are involved in documentation and dissemination of cultural knowledge. All the curators/keepers of anthropological museums do have a basic degree of anthropology or are trained in anthropology. The connection between anthropology and tribal culture is rightly elaborated by Grace Morley (1967). She writes:

Probably no museum subject in India need more attention than anthropology… Few countries are richer than India in tribal and folk arts and artefacts, and all that goes with ancient traditional communities, which have developed and been protected in some isolation over a long period time. Their disappearance without trace, or with only inadequate records will represent a loss, not only for India but for the world'. (Morley 1967: vii)

Not only has she emphasised the link between anthropology and tribal culture, but she has pleaded for the preservation of tribal culture in museums, the traditional ethnographic materials to be specific (Morley 1967). This explains the role of anthropologists in museums and anthropological background of curators. They use Anthropological methods and techniques to document indigenous knowledge, particularly, the visual forms of traditional technology and art forms of different communities for a critical study of their stages of development. Arguably, museums have both policy implications in the field of development and preservation role to play as far as culture is concerned.

### **Visualizing the Culture in Totality**

Exhibition and its mode of display of collections are the main attractions for the prospective visitors and present the culture as a whole in visual form. Collections found in anthropological museums mainly consist of hunting and food gathering implements, fishing implements, agricultural implements, household objects, dress and ornaments, objects related to travel and transport, sports and amusement items, rites and rituals and art and crafts. Both collections and the way they are presented to visitors are important. Julian Spalding (1999) therefore emphasizes more on what a museum gives to its visitors than on the collection it possesses. Certainly, a systematic collection of the material culture along with the relevant information provides the visitors a total picture of a particular community. Undoubtedly, the task is challenging for the museum professionals to make the exhibition popular and to maintain it so that it can generate interest and can also be a source of enjoyment to the public. In this regard it is worth mentioning that the museum is a useful and essentially a visual medium of mass education of culture and history of humankind.

Anthropological museums mainly provide the people a place to generate ideas and thoughts and to make stories on know-how or ethos of various ethnic groups or communities. Finlay (1977:15) remarks:

…if museums are to come alive and stay alive they must present ideas. It is not enough to permit the public to view vistas of stuffed animals…the impact made by rows of stuffed animals is nothing beside the impact which may be made by the imaginative presentation of biological ideas.

### **Museum Collection**

Sachin Roy in 1967 made a systematic survey of anthropological collection at various museums in India for the first time. Of the total number of 251 museums in India, he found only 18 museums exclusively ethnographical and only 19 having mixed collections, ethnographical collections along with other collections. This list also included a number of university department museums and a few museums having a very small collection numbering not more than 50 (Roy 1967: 8–9).

By and large all anthropological museums have a rich collection of material culture, commonly known as ethnographic objects, collected from different communities. Through the ethnographic specimens collected from various ethnic groups (tribal communities) in a museum, a community may be portrayed in its totality (Soni 1995: 65). Though these ethnographic specimens directly do not give the biological information of an ethnic group, they throw light on their art, aesthetics, economic pursuits, religious beliefs, indigenous skills, knowledge system, food habits, costumes and degree of adaptability with the ecology and simple living. How museum exhibits are useful to understand various aspects of cultural life of ethnic communities can be exemplified with reference to an Anthropological museum.

The ethnographic collection of the Zonal Anthropological Museum located at Mysore covers the ethnic groups (tribal groups) such as the Toda, the Kota, the Mullu Kurumba, the Irular, the Malasar, the Kurumba of Tamil Nadu, the Soliga, Jenu Kuruba, the Malai Kudia, the Badaga, the PanjariYerava of Karnataka**,** the Ulladan, the Mala Arayan, the Kadar, the Cholanaikan, the Hill Pulayan, the Paniyan, the Kattunaikan, the Urali Kuruman, the Adiyan, the Kurichian, the KunduVadiyan of Kerala and the Sugali, the Bagatha, the Kondakapu, the Putiya Paiku, the Lingadhari Koya, the Koya, the Yerukula, the Chenchu, the Valmiki, the Lambadi, the Yanadi, the Mukhadora, the Soara, the Jatapu of Andhra Pradesh and Minicoyans of Minicoy Islands of Lakshadweep. At a glance, visitors to this museum get an idea about the different tribal groups and their distribution in the southern zone of the Indian subcontinent.

Quite a good number of artefacts, displaying diversity in material culture, have been collected from tribal communities like Irular, Mullu Kurumba, Toda, Kota of Tamil Nadu; Chenchu and Jatapu, Lambadi of Andhra Pradesh; Kurichiyan, Hill Pulayan, Kadar and Cholanaickan of Kerala and Soliga, Panjari Yerava of Karnataka. These collections in general not only represent the various cultural heritage materials of the southern zone of India but also highlight the specific cultural uniqueness of a particular tribal culture. The tribal cultures are fast changing due to modernization and market economy, thereby losing their essence and sanctity. The material culture, which were being acquired for the Zonal Museum in the 1950s and 1960s, is a matter of pride and much acclaimed heritage as most of these are not available now and, if a few are found, they have lost their indigeneity.

Likewise the collections from Minicoy Islanders of Lakshadweep, who are scheduled as tribes and follow Islam, are important as they portray the Island culture and have made the Zonal Anthropological Museum unique to a great extent. These collections were made in 1980. There are no further collections from the Islanders of the Minicoy either in the Zonal Anthropological Museum, Mysore or in any other museums of mainland India.

The ethnographic collection of the anthropological museum consists of household articles like bamboo and cane baskets, rain hat and raincoat (made out of leaves), wooden toys, mat, wooden seat, earthen vessels, bark cloth, wooden mortar and pestle, wooden measuring pots, ladle, walking sticks, digging sticks; agricultural implements like wooden plough, leveller, hoe; hunting and fishing implements like bow and arrows, spear, fishing trap, fishing net, fishing arrow, etc.; and creative art objects like head gear, membrane musical instruments, dress and ornaments and masks. These objects or cultural traits when arranged or displayed in a systematic manner help to widen an integrated idea about the culture and cultural habits of different ethnic groups or communities living in the islands.

The collections (Table 13.1) from Lakshadweep Islands are made in the year 1980. The inhabitants of these Islands are Muslim by religion. These collections decode the dress patterns, religious beliefs, subsistence type of economy, economic activities, transportation mode, traditional games of the Islanders of Lakshadweep and their ecology. Wooden board with holes for playing cowries, locally known as *achchu*, reflects their traditional board games, which is very common in the Island culture. Museum collections like *nila-mehidau* (a fishing net), *veech-vala* (a fishing net), *kuruli* (a fishing hook), *vatta-chatali* (a fishing hook) and *emvarhi* (a fishing net) portray their traditional economic activities, i.e. fishing. The fish is abundant. The most commonly used and available one is the tuna fish, which is displayed in the museum as handicraft item as *tuna-meen* (tuna fish). The Island's coconut plantation constitutes a powerful ecological segment, and the importance of coconut plantation for human survival is immense. Collections like *kai-tadap* (small coir rope ring (loop) used for climbing), *kal-tadap* (a coir rope ring for climbing), *hunigondi* (coconut scraper), *nagudi* (container made of coconut shell) and *kuhurambadi* (decorated container of coconut shell) show how the coconut plant is important in the lives of Islanders. In the olden days, tapping *Neera* and climbing the coconut tree was common scenario in the Islands; but now-a-days young people keep themselves away from climbing the tree as they find it laborious. So climbing devices are hardly found in the Islands. The modern climbing devices, made of iron,

are used nowadays too by the mainland<sup>3</sup> climbers who are hired by these islanders to pluck the coconut and for dressing the trees. The other handicraft items collected as museum collection are different kinds of boats known as *jahadoni* (race boat). *odum* (country boat) and *odi* (country boat), which signify their travel and transport facilities and also reflect the ecological background of the settlement of the Islanders. Similarly, *Foigondi*, the Koran stand, which is also collected from Lakshadweep Islands, attests to their Islamic faiths.

## **Collection Retrieves Retrospection**

Collection of anthropological museum retrieves our understanding of bio-cultural diversity, traditional techniques and knowledge; enriches our understanding of linguistic diversity and ethnic identity; enlightens our understanding of inter-tribal relations and economic transactions like barter system and informs us about the notion of tribal solidarity, their simplicity and aesthetic sense; enlightens our understanding of inter-tribal relations, economic transactions like barter system and so on. Mere observation of material culture in the tribal villages or in market places does not suffice for developing such an understanding which one gets through museum exhibits. Retrospection is only possible in a comparative perspective when these material objects are displayed in a systematic way in the museum.

Understanding Bio-cultural Diversity Knowledge of different communities and their cultures is very necessary for administrative, sociopolitical and developmental point of view. In our democratic country, without knowing or understanding the diversity of people and their culture, embarking upon a people-specific decision in a general frame becomes a problem. It is true that anthropology is the only discipline where we study the bio-cultural aspects of human beings through an intensive fieldwork and try to correlate the inter-tribal relationship and their migration history. Anthropological museums play a key role in establishing links with our universe of research as well as in disseminating the findings on bio-cultural diversity of people.

<sup>&</sup>lt;sup>3</sup>The Lakshadweep Islanders refer to places like Cochin, Calicut of Kerala and Mangalore of Karnataka as mainland. These nearby places from the Islands are often accessed by ship for their daily needs and health-care services.

**Traditional Techniques and Knowledge** Tribal people have devised some techniques for fulfilling their needs by directing the physical environment in their favour. With the passage of time, some of these traditional techniques have completely faded out, some are in incipient form restricted to a few societies and some are totally metamorphosed, while others have retained their original form and carry on without much change.

This knowledge, thought, idea and technique of tribal people are being transmitted through oral tradition from one generation to the next one. In order to preserve this tradition, the museum plays a vital role. An endeavour has been made by curating the Traditional Technology Park as an open-air exhibition in the IGRMS premises. This is to make people aware of the diversity as well as the creativity of our forefathers in developing sustainable technology for their livelihood and survival. The following are various aspects of traditional technological excellence which are exhibited and curated by the tribal and folk people in the museum premises:

Traditional salt-making device (*thum-shungba*) of the Meitei people of Manipur Water-operated husking lever (*tui-changshu*) of the Kuki tribal people of Manipur Traditional water-lifting device (*eddulamota)* of coastal Andhra Pradesh Earthen furnace (*sunnapubatti*) of Nagavansam community of Andhra Pradesh for

limestone production

Traditional oil press (*gangu*) of Telukula community of Andhra Pradesh Husk lever (*dhenki*) by the Rajwar community of Chhattisgarh and *Gharat* Water force-driven grinding device of the Rabai community of Uttarakhand

Tribes are known for their traditional knowledge and practices in diverse fields. Mention may be made of ethnomedicine and its use in health care, management of natural resources, particularly forests, oral tradition and the art of communication, their workmanship in making utilitarian objects and others.

Mythological trail is a component of the open-air exhibition of IGRMS in which tribal artisans from different parts of the country have made visual representations with their aesthetic appeal and their workmanship to depict various myths, legends and folktales in different media (terracotta, wood, stone, iron, etc.). Crafts of various artisan groups, incarnation of folk deities, traditional paintings, etc. form the main attraction of the exhibition. The idea behind it is to visualize the oral tradition with the help of workmanship by the concerned experts of the particular ethnic group whose tradition is to be depicted or presented. Sacred grove exhibition is one of the open-air exhibitions of the National Museum of Mankind, in which efforts are made to recreate natural vegetation through plantation of various species and the associated supernatural power by installing images of folk deities and their representation. The idea behind this exhibition is to document, preserve and disseminate their eco-specific knowledge of management of natural resources and to give the visitors an idea about the utility of sacred groves. The medicinal plants (140 species) in various parts of the country used by various ethnic groups preserved through plantation in the museum campus form an important outdoor exhibition popularly known as *Medicinal Trail.*

**Understanding Linguistic Diversity** Language is an important source of diversity and unity. There are as many as 325 languages and 25 scripts in use deriving from various linguistic families such as the Indo-Aryan, Tibeto-Burman, Dravidian, Austro-Asiatic, Andamanese, Semitic Indo-Iranian and Indo-European. At least 65 percent of the communities (4365, studied by Anthropological Survey of India) are bilingual, though most of the tribal communities are trilingual. The numerous mother tongues are important instruments of cultural expression and preservation of diversity. Display panels in the form of designed graphics have been exhibited on the language distribution in India and language families including tribal languages of 75 PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups). A 3-D image of the map of India in IGRMS with the depiction of different language families of India is in the pipeline. This will be the real representation of the linguistic diversity of India.

### **Ethnic Perception Through Museum Collections**

Collection of ethnographic materials is made from remote corners of the country's innumerable folk and tribal villages. These ethnographic materials displayed as museum specimen focus on the traditional life of the ethnic group and their ideas and aspirations along with their cultural background. The skill and indigenous knowledge with which tribal people design their homes and fashion various ethnographic objects with the limited accessible materials available in their surroundings mark these underdeveloped people to be more cultured. And if in today's world we want to seek the roots of our cultural identity and visualize a model life pattern, we have to go to the tribal group for it. Here an attempt has been made to perceive how ethnographic specimen, as museum collection, is significant bearing the cultural heritage of some ethnic groups. Examples of such specimens as trademark of cultural bearing of particular ethnic group are discussed below.

**Bison Horn Dancing Headgear** It was collected in the year 1998 as museum specimen. It is a colourful and dancing headgear used by the *Bison Horn Maria.* The headgear is locally known as *Nacha Singa (nacha-*dancing, *singa*-horn) as they wear this headgear during dancing*.* The basketry cap is made of loosely twilled bamboo strips running diagonally from the edge that fits over the brows. It has to support two huge-sized polished *Bison horns* and the plume of feathers. Many folds and streamers of cloth of various colours are used to tighten it and make it fit round the head. The peacock's tail feathers are tied together and made into a stalk, below which are added good numbers of tail feathers of the red jungle cock. Then the stalks are plaited together with horizontal twilled wefts of bamboo rind. The plume is fastened vertically to the peak of the basketry cap by a bamboo rod, and it adorns the headgear to a great extent. Six tassels of strings, made of cowries, hang from its lower edge over the face. It is further adorned with flakes of mica or groups of cowries or brass studs.

It is used as headdress during dancing by *Bison Horn Maria*. This tribal community is also known as *Dandami Maria*. These Dandami Marias of Bastar of Chhattisgarh state are famous for their dance, known as *Ganwar Nacha* (*ganwar*-Bison, *nacha*-dance). They are also popular for their headgear, which also distinguishes them from their counterpart, i.e. Hill Maria or Abujumaria – a tribal community which lives in the same cultural area. It is the headgear made of *Ganwar* (*Bison* sp.) horns which makes the Maria dance popular as it is worn by the male dancers of Dandami Marias. This headgear marks the cultural identity of the community and signifies the genesis of the term *Bison Horn Maria*.

### **Relevancy of Anthropological Museum**

The museum serves as a centre for visual education. A museum can be termed as functionally potential when museological activities and research activities run simultaneously. A systematic collection of ethnographic objects not only enrich the anthropological museum but also provide the museum a strong ground as a source of research centre. Ethnographic museums play a vital role for conserving cultural heritage through collection, preservation and exhibition of cultural objects. Again preservation of cultural heritage of the tribal communities is more essential as the tribal culture is tradition oriented and portrays the cultural diversity.

The scope of the anthropological museum includes the culture of the 461 tribal groups as identified by the Anthropological Survey of India under the plan project 'People of India'. The aim of museum is to preserve, develop and promote tangible and intangible cultural heritage, through documentation and dissemination. Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today and what we pass on to future generations. Documentation is the process of recording the information of the museum collection systematically. Documentation is of two types – written documentation and audio-visual documentation. Knowledge dissemination through exhibition (mobile or permanent) is part of the museum activities.

There are various ways of preservation of tribal culture adopted by the anthropological museums:

- 1. Showcasing the cultural materials in the museum gallery
- 2. Producing audio-video documentary on the tribal's way of life
- 3. Organizing craft demonstration or artist camp by inviting the craftsmen/artists of different tribal groups to the museum
- 4. Organising workshop cum exhibition on tribal cultural heritage (by inviting the museum experts, local people and community experts)
- 5. Disseminating the tribal art with the involvement of the general public after learning by doing during the workshop cum training programme in museum premises
- 6. Recording the tribal lore like tribal tales, tribal songs, tribal music, tribal dance, etc.

The Zonal Anthropological Museum is working towards the preservation of intangible cultural heritage after recording tribal songs, folktales, dialects and speeches of noted personalities, after organizing traditional performing arts like leather puppetry and Yakshagana (a traditional folk performance of Karnataka) and by making documentary films on tribal culture like Cholanaickan tribe of Kerala, Apatani tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh and so on.

Development schemes by and large failed due to utter negligence to felt needs of the community people ignoring some of their cultural values. Real development can be achieved if the people are allowed to decide their course of development, and the planning may be made considering the worldview of the community concerned and human and material resources. Anthropological Museum plays a vital role in the process of empowering community people. It highlights people's knowledge and practices with regard to preservation of medicinal plants, water harvesting mechanism, traditional architecture, sacred grooves and conservation of forest, and several others through exhibitions. In doing so, the museum recognizes people's capability and instils a sense of pride in them for possessing the knowledge and making use of it. Organization of such exhibitions aims at motivating people to develop along the line of their own genius.

Today, museums must become agents of change and development; they must mirror events in society and become instruments of progress by diverting attention to actions and events that will encourage development in the society. They must become institutions that can foster peace; they must be seen as promoting the ideals of democracy and transparency in governance in their communities; and they must become part of the bigger communities that they serve and reach out to every group in the society. For museums to retain their relevance and become positive partners in the development of our society, they should use their unique resources and potentials to become more responsive to the dynamics of modern society (Arinze 1999).

The contribution of museums towards preservation of cultural heritage and promoting tourism of a particular region is immense. The preservation of traditional dwellings houses of the Toda and the Kota tribal people is important to retain the cultural heritage of the Nilgiri hills which had been a place of attraction to the foreigners since the colonial period. Anthropological museums play a vital role in assembling such tribal dwellings in its premises.

One of the main aims of the museum is that it imparts education to the public. Visitors to the museum are taken around the exhibition and given special lessons by the curatorial staff. Popular lecture series, lectures, talks and guided lecture tours are mainly carried out by the curatorial staff in the museum. Under the museum's 'Do and Learn' educational programme, the museum organizes demonstration and training activities for registered participants to salvage and preserve especially tribal art and handicraft traditions.

This programme not only brings out the knowledge associated with different traditional art forms but also creates awareness towards such traditions among the masses and makes attempt for moral boosting of respective craft persons. Special education programme for school children is also carried out. Students are given exposure to the theme 'Man, Habitat and Environment' and are provided with opportunity of creative work on this theme through clay modelling and drawing.

### **Tribal People and New Museology**

As the concept of new museology diverts our concentration towards the new arena, we, the curators of anthropological museums, have started giving emphasis on how a museum can be community oriented instead of object oriented. Through the various outreach programmes conducted in the tribal villages, efforts are being made by the museum curators to reinforce the awareness towards their potentiality of having diverse traditional knowledge and creative art forms. By developing the community museum sites in the tribal dominated areas, the museum professionals assure the community members that they are the real owner and beholder of their exotic rich culture which needs to be revitalized or revived in the new millennium era. The curators are given the responsibility of making the museum lively and community oriented rather than object oriented. Traditional methods for conservation play an important role in preserving the ethnographic objects, executed with the help of experts of the particular tribal group, whose cultural artefacts are to be restored. Conservation of ethnographic objects, partially damaged, is best restored through structural maintenance by the artists of the particular tribal group who produce and fashion them. Curators of anthropological museums merely act as a catalyst and take the help of the community members only to maintain the indigene of the ethnographic objects. In this sense the community artists are the real curators of their own cultural heritage for posterity.

### **Conclusions**

Thus museums in India create public awareness about the rich and diversified culture and the contribution of each community to their cultural heritage. Museums are the only institution which assures the public a place of genuineness and authenticity. Time will come when anthropological museums must take the necessary steps to honour and pay respect to the people who contributed through their valuable donated/gifted collection.

Now museums act as a social space for the younger generation. This space is created through interactive devices like mobile apps, informative kiosks and audiovisual aids. Young visitors are connected with this space for entertainment, thematic orientation on educational curriculum and so on. The programme is further enriched by available museum exhibits. In this age of globalization, it is very much necessary to develop anthropological museums, which not only help considerably bring about a sense of integration among the various sections of the Indian population but also provide an essential medium of mass education to understand humankind as a whole and different ethnic groups in particular.

In short, all cultures change slowly or rapidly. No culture is absolutely static. An anthropological museum is the only place where the preservation of cultural objects is done to represent the original culture, especially the cultural heritage of the tribal community by way of systematic collection and care of ethnographic objects for posterity. An anthropological museum is not only treasure house of the tangible evidence of man's history, of his creativeness and traditional knowledge, but it acts as research cum recreation centre as it engages both scholars and the common public for its good numbers of scholarly publication, supported by a large number of audio-video documentation. Each community gathers some sort of ideas of other cultures while visiting the various cultural objects in the museum. In viewing the museum objects, a particular tribal community shares their feelings attached with these artefacts and expresses their views. In the long run, community members would come forward to build bridges with anthropological museums.
