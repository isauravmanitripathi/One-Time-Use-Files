**Abstract** This chapter makes an attempt to present contemporary lifeways of the Muslim community of Minicoy Islanders of Lakshadweep, scheduled as a tribe in Indian Constitution, with a conscious effort of engaging historical approach to study the culture. The chapter studies sociocultural identity of assimilation and acculturation that has evolved over time in an interactive mode and therefore emphasizes on interdisciplinary methods and approaches. Primarily, the contemporary sociocultural structure showing contrasts like matrilinity and practice of monogamy along with Islam, and syncretic tradition like following Islamic tenets in marriage practice, is presented in a historical perspective.

# **Introduction**

In India, the population, which is categorized as tribal population, constitutes a major portion of it as an administrative category and is designated as Scheduled Tribes (STs) according to the provisions of the constitution. The other portion is non-scheduled, but most of them display similar characteristics as those of ST groups. However, the non-ST groups are an academic construct, but for all practical purposes, the term tribe refers to ST in India whose population constitutes 8.6% of the total population of the country according to Census 2011 (GoI 2011). Tribal population is found settled in various ecological and geo-climatic conditions across the country, starting from the hills of northeast to the deserts of Rajasthan in the west and from the valley of Himalayas in the north to Kanyakumari in the south. Obviously, their habitats range from plains and forests to hills, deserts and areas of

island ecology that include Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal in the east and in Lakshadweep in southwest in the Arabian Sea. Needless to say, tribal groups also live in the mainland and in islands as well, and many of their habitats are even today isolated ecological and geo-climatic niches.

This paper is about an islander tribe of Minicoy Island in Lakshadweep. Since ancient times, maritime trade from Indian subcontinent to Arabia was passing through the Lakshadweep Islands. The Lakshadweep Islands stand as witness to the process of transculturation due to business and trade connections.

The inhabitants of the Lakshadweep Islands under the administration of the Union Territory of India are categorized as Scheduled Tribes. All the natives of the Lakshadweep are classified as Scheduled Tribes. According to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes list (modification orders), 1956, the inhabitants of Lakshadweep who and both of whose parents were born in these islands are treated as Scheduled Tribes (see Census 2011).

These people have their unique traditions and cultures, the carrier of the banner of diversity for which India and its tribes stand. Typical features of the islanders, in terms of demography and sociocultural dynamics, attract not only the scholars and researchers to satisfy their academic interests but also the government agencies to meet their development needs keeping development goals of the nation in view and without alienating them from their cultural mores. This consideration of special care within the constitutional frame of preferential treatment and positive discrimination is aimed to bring them at par the national level of development.

Almost in all the islands of the Lakshadweep group, a spectacular change is noticed over time. Nevertheless, very less is known about Minicoy Island and its inhabitants who called their island *Maliku*. Interestingly, the inhabitants have well responded to the forces of change but without allowing the forces to swipe away their age-old customs and values. The striking features about them at present are the practice of matrilinity, though they profess Islam and their ethnic distinction. In different periods of time, they have interacted with diverse external forces. Instead of being swayed away by these forces, they have strengthened their culture accepting what are good to them. Unlike many other tribes, the understanding of these people does not entirely depend on ethnographic approach. These people have a past in the recorded history in their relations with Maldives, other islands of present Lakshadweep and territory of Malabar.

# *Lakshadweep*

The Lakshadweep Islands emerged from volcanic activities in the Arabian Sea between 8° and 12°30′ north latitudes and between 71° and 74° east longitudes. It is at a distance ranging from 200–400 km from mainland. The name Lakshadweep means a hundred thousand islands, though the islands are countable. Out of 27 islands recorded, 3 are reefs and 6 submerged sand banks; only 10 islands are inhabited. The inhabited islands of Lakshadweep Union Territory are Kavaratti,

Agatti, Amini, Kadmat, Kiltan, Chetlat, Bitra, Andrott, Kalpeni and Minicoy. Bitra is the smallest of all having only a population of 271 persons (Census 2011, also see Vadivelu 1998 for information on the formation of the island). According to the official website of UT Lakshadweep, during 2011 census operation, one of the earlier uninhabited islands, Bangaram, has been enumerated and has a population of 61 persons. In the past, these groups of islands were known as "the Laccadive, Amindivi and Minicoy groups of islands". In 1956, the Laccadive, Amindivi and Minicoy groups of islands became a Union Territory of India in the name of Lakshadweep. Understandably, all the islands of Lakshadweep fall under one territorial administrative jurisdiction with its capital at Kavaratti.

# *Historical Background1*

The islands of Lakshadweep of the Indian Union Territory have a recorded history which points to the important role they played in forming a link between the Middle East and the Malabar Coast of southern India in the past. An article published by Gaur, Vora, Sundaresh, Tripati, Gudigar and Bandodker (1998) with reference to a literature of the first century called *Periplus of the Erythrean Sea* traces its past importance. The authors find the existence of Lakshadweep as an island during that period and its importance as an important trade route. The trade between Arabs and Malabar was very strong at that time; and the Arabs frequently travelled through maritime route by crossing the Lakshadweep Islands. During those days it was also a centre of attraction for the sculptors of the *Faras*, the Buddhist monks (Sharma and Khan 1994), and later on it became famous for boat manufacturing from the trunk of coconut tree. Hourani (1951) informs that the gulf countries of those days used to import coconut as well as its wood. In the beginning of the tenth century when Kolathiris were controlling north Malabar, they also controlled Lakshadweep from their headquarters at Ezhimala near Cannannore (modern day Kannur district of Kerala). In the early twelfth century, it was under Ali Rajas of Cannanore. The Ali Rajas controlled the islands by appointing an officer called Kariyakkar; he was the one who took care of the internal matters of islanders, though the officer was an outsider (Ittaman 1976) to the land.

Apart from trade connections, the islanders had encountered the outsiders such as the Portuguese and the British when they attacked the islands. The invasion of the Portuguese during the fifteenth and sixteenth (from 1498 to 1545) centuries and the attack of the British in the eighteenth century were two historical events. The Portuguese built one fort at Amini Island to rule, but they faced the resistance of the inhabitants. The inhabitants started a revolution to throw out the Portuguese, and in their efforts, King Cherikul of Malabar helped them a lot. A popular story tells that to free the islanders from Portuguese, King Cherikul sent a poisoner named Kadantavanjiraka to the island, who killed many Portuguese people. This was also

thought to be one of the major causes of their loss on the Lakshadweep Islands. Lakshadweep then was brought under the province of King Cherikul, who ruled over the territory indirectly. Being an important trade location, it attracted the British who succeeded to bring it under their rule gradually from 1799 after the defeat of Tipu Sultan in Srirangapatnam battle in 1799 till it became Union Territory of India in 1956 (see Ellis 1924/1992; Kapoor 2002; and [lakshaweep.nic.in](http://lakshaweep.nic.in) for history).

# **The Minicoy Island**

Among the ten inhabited islands, Minicoy Island is the southernmost island of Lakshadweep group of islands. It is called, as it is mentioned earlier, as Maliku Island by its inhabitants. The location of the island is between 8°15′ and 8°20′ north latitudes and between 73°01′ and 73°05′ east longitudes. The total area of the island is about 4.4 km2 including the attached islet of *Viringli*, known as Smallpox Island. This Minicoy Island is in close vicinity to the Maldives, just separated by the 8° or Vangaaru channel and considered as an independent oceanic island, not belonging to either Maldives or the Lakshadweep bank. It is believed that the island is formed as the vegetation found on the island got compressed and changed into soft sandstone over centuries. The height of the island is around 1–2 m above the mean sea level (refer to and compare with the account of Basevi 1872 about Minicoy Island). The livelihood of islanders depends largely on coconut plantation and fishing. Most of the young male inhabitants of the island work in ships and cargos as seamen.

# **Minicoy in the Past**

While visiting the Minicoy Island, one finds a different world as compared to other islands of Lakshadweep. From available literature and interaction with the people during field study, it was found that the people of Minicoy are culturally akin to the Maldives. Their language, their costumes and even the scripts resemble those of the Maldivians. The island got its independent status after being separated from the sultanates of Maldives. Though the inhabitants have affinity with the Maldivians, their culture is an admixture of cultures of Maldives and Cannanore.

Some historical sources reflect that there was strong trade and marriage bond between the Ali Rajas of Cannanore and the sultan of Maldives. One more story was found in Maldivian collective memory which is supported by historical account. In 1734, after a cyclone and subsequent hard time, the islanders of Minicoy requested the Maldivian king for financial support, but they got a refusal from the Maldivian king. On the other hand, they found favour and support from the king of Cannanore. As a result, they were obliged to the king of Cannanore and allied to his kingdom (see Gabriel 1989).

The Ali Raja of Cannanore ruled over 30 islands, and they had marriage contract with Maldivian sultan. This also helped them to build up strong relationship in maritime trades (Payard 1619/1888). This may be also another reason of cultural admixture of Maldives and Malabar as found in Minicoy culture.

Laccadive, Amindivi and Minicoy groups of islands were under the rule of the Ali Rajas, also known as Imbichi Ali-Adi Raja Bibi, but in 1787, Tipu Sultan acceded to the petitions of the northern islanders to attach the land with his kingdom. But with the defeat of Tipu Sultan, his kingdom along with the territory of Lakshadweep Islands fell into British hands in 1799 (Kapoor 2002: 4198–99). The British allowed the Ali Rajas to rule Minicoy with the condition of paying some tax and the coir in return. But in 1905, Ali Raja Imbichi Bibi was the last ruler in the line of the Ali Rajas who handed the Minicoy completely to the British rulers (Ellis 1924/1992). After independence, Laccadive, Amindivi and Minicoy groups of Islands came under Indian administration and now constitute the Union Territory of Lakshadweep (Kapoor 2002).

# **The Islanders of Minicoy2**

# *Physical Feature*

The physical features and appearance of Minicoy islanders are quite different from the people residing on other islands of Lakshadweep. Most of the islanders of Lakshadweep resemble Malayalam people of Kerala. But the islanders of Minicoy resemble primitive Singhalese. Their face is round and flat, modified to some extent by an admixture of Arab blood. The males are fair to dark complexion and flat waved to narrow waved hair and have medium stature. The females are found fairer in complexion than men.

# *Language*

The islanders of Minicoy speak a language, called *Mahl*, similar to the language spoken in the southern islands of Maldives. *Mahl* is an Indo-European language known as *Divehi-bas* and is written in *Thaana-akuru*. The language is written right to left like Arabic and Urdu and has a lot of similarities with many Urdu, Arabic and Sanskrit words.

<sup>2</sup>Based on Ahemad and Edurukage (2016).

# *Religion*

More than 95% of the islanders of Minicoy are followers of Islam. They follow the Sunni sect of Islam and strictly obey the rules and laws of Islam (cf. Suad 2004; Gabriel 1989).

# *Educational Scenario*

As per the Census India 2011, Minicoy has population of 10,447 of which 5366 are males while 5081 females. Sex ratio is of 947. Literacy rate of Minicoy is 82.0%, out of which male literacy is around 84.0%, while female literacy rate is about 80.0%.

The islanders are also found having a fair knowledge in a few international languages as many of them work as the seamen in the international ships and cargos and others come in contact with people of these speech communities. Though literacy rate is comparatively higher than national average of 74.04%, interest in higher and technical education was found very low as they get the job after obtaining education up to secondary level. It was found that higher education among the female population is not encouraging; they pursue their education at best up to higher secondary level in the island. There is something traditional in their outlook. Females are not allowed to pursue higher education beyond the island. To get the higher education, they have to go to Cochin or other parts of the country which is not encouraged for the females.

# *The Strata*

In early days the inhabitants were classified according to their wealth and the jobs they used to do. The *Bodung* or *Manikfan/Manika* used to be landlords and occupied the elite section of the society. Next to them in social status were the *Mallimin* or *Thakurufans*, sailors who mainly piloted sailing vessels during ancient time. *Medukembin* or *Thakurus* were those who worked in the boats during the sea trips. In between *Thakurufan* and *Thakuru*, there is a subclass known as *Bebe.* The *Raveris* were the labourers. Women corresponding to these four status groups were known as *Manikka*, *Beefan*, *Bebe* and *Kambilo*, respectively (Jha 1998).

According to their oral narratives and documents available on the Minicoy, it was found that these four status groups correspond to those people who came along with two Maldivian princesses, Kamboranin and Kohoratukamana, to the island and their companions. When Malè3 was invaded, the princesses were compelled to leave the

<sup>3</sup>Malè is the capital and most populous city in the Republic of Maldives.

place. These people replaced previous inhabitants of the island and became the ancestors of modern Minicoy islanders (Kattner 1996).

Nowadays, social difference is not too rigid in the Minicoy society, though different social classes exist in the society.

The social difference is noticed in gender and status differences in the dress pattern. Even in recent time, the women of the elite class prefer to wear dresses made up of Bengal silk. Their *Libas* is a long silk dress with short sleeves, with openings only at the neck, where it is fastened together by two loops. Their head is covered by a scarf called *Doli,* worn in a particular manner. Both sexes are very fond of ornaments; they prefer to wear gold ornaments (see Colton 1995).

# *Property Inheritance*

The islanders are endogamous and live in the joint family so that brothers can retain their ancestral customs. Property is therefore inherited in the family line which is matriarchal. In recent years a few cases of exogamy are found when a male member married to a girl from outside the island. In such cases, their problems (if any) were discussed at a village meeting and resolved in a very amicable manner. Sometimes the relatives of the family would give a separate plot of land to them. Sometimes the married couple prefer to live in the mainland India as a solution to handle the situation, and they are deprived of the rights to ancestral properly.

# *Disputes*

The island society is a closely knit society of kins, and so disputes, if they arise relating to matrimony or ancestral property, are settled in the community. It is to be mentioned that the first police station in Lakshadweep was established in Minicoy in 1958, but the crime rate in the island, particularly among the native islanders is very negligible.

# *Information Technology*

At many places 4G mobile connection is available in Lakshadweep Islands, but still very poor network connection was found throughout the Minicoy Island. Cable TV along with the D2H services is the main sources of information and entertainment to the islanders. The young generation of the island possesses a sound knowledge of Internet and computer technologies.

# *Health and Sanitation*

The health and sanitary conditions were found satisfactory inside the village areas, but on the seashores, it was remarkably unsatisfactory. After harvesting tuna fish, the waste is left unattended on the shore. Fortunately, no epidemic disease was reported in the Minicoy Island in the past. On the other hand, in the two islands, namely, Andrott and Kalpeni, the epidemic of *chikungunya* fever in 2006 was reported (Samuel et al. 2009). From the official sources, it was found that leprosy and filariasis were widespread in the island in the past.

Sociocultural norms pertaining to the health-related issues are very strong among the islanders. In the past, there were isolated places far away from the villages for the people who were found affected by leprosy. The area is still known as *Kodi*.

Pre- or extramarital sexual relations are strictly prohibited. Most of the young men serve as seamen and spend their time on the island. In recent years the rule which is strictly followed by all the bachelor male islanders is to go for the HIV test before marriage and also after landing on the island. To control the population, the individual families use the modern methods of family planning, rather than any indigenous methods.

There is one government hospital functioning in the island. The island is the second in terms of health facility; it has got a dispensary in 1890 but was closed due to some reasons. Again in 1962 it was reopened, and at present it is having a capacity of 20 beds along with an operation theatre, labour room and pathological laboratory.

The islanders in the past used their own traditional herbal medications as preventive and curative healthcare. At present only few people have knowledge of the traditional herbal medications. It was also due to less interest and introduction of allopathic services at the island.

# *Marriage, Childbirth and Death Ritual*

The practice of monogamy is mainly found in Minicoy society, and they do not permit polygyny. The *Athiri* (village common place) is well known for gathering of the youths and the villagers, and this helps in making marriage contracts. After marriage negotiation is finalized, most of the expenses of the marriage ceremony, known as *Kaveni* (Nikah) and is executed by the village Kateeb, is borne by the groom. The wedding can be performed either in the bride's house or in the groom's house in the presence of the Kateeb*.* They strictly maintain island endogamy as they don't want to welcome the strangers or do not let their daughters to stay away from their island. Nowadays this thinking has changed, and they do not insist their daughters and sons to follow the same. After the marriage the groom resides at her in-laws house and can also spend his time at his mother's house.

Divorce is very rare among the islanders. But both the bride and groom are not bound to live together if something went wrong in their relations. All marriages are performed under the sharia law of Islam.

The birth normally takes place at mother's place, and the child is supposed to be there for at least 6 days. After 6 days the newly born child may visit his/her father's ancestral place. On the 20th day, the baby's head is tonsured and a common feast is arranged. The tonsured hair of the baby is weighed against gold or silver, which would be given to the poor, and this ceremony, *Bobeylun*, is celebrated by all the groups of Minicoy Island.

Circumcision of boys, *Banjan*, includes elaborate celebration at least for a week and generally takes place when a child is in the age group of 3–7 years. The death ceremony is performed as per the Islamic customs after a namaz (prayer) called "Karu namadu". After the completion of burial, a stone is placed on the grave known as "Khagau" to identify the grave.

# **Governance in the Island4**

Each household is presided over by the senior woman of the house, and in each house, an average of six to seven people reside. Houses are grouped to form a village known as Avah or Athiri. There is no fixed population size to form a village; all the villages, ten at present in the island, are ancient villages. Each *Avah* has a distinct colour for symbolic presentation of village identity and its own land, tuna fishing boat, country crafts and coconut trees. In each village there is *Athiri*, a common site at the western beach for boat landing. Income generated from the village property and their assets are used for the welfare of the village and the island. Common feasts and celebrations are organized at the village house which has a large hall and a larger space outside it. During festive occasions, village houses also play an important role in organizing awareness and other programmes.

Two *Bodukakas* (headman) and two *Bodudatha* (head women), selected by consensus of the villagers, rather than by election, administer each *Avah.* The first *Bodukaka* looks after internal matters, and the second one deals with external affairs. Administration of male duties such as hauling the boats onshore, fishing, collection of boulders for safeguarding and marking the boundary of the village are also managed by them.

Each Avah has two village houses – one for male and the other for female. All the female duties beyond the family are normally carried out in the *Varhange*, the female village house and male duties in the *Avarthuge*, male village house.

The village headmen and women, besides administering such activities as boat sailing, sanitation, etc., also monitor the income generation activities for their village and assign duties to the villagers on the matter of health and sanitation. During the rainy season, the drainage of the village gets blocked, and it is to be taken care of by the villagers; it is managed by the Bodukakas. The proper disposal of the tuna waste within the village area is also monitored by the village heads. The religious festival like Eid and common feasts organized in village houses are managed by *Bodudatha*. The duties assigned for income generation activities like

<sup>4</sup>The discussion on sociopolitical organization is based on Colton (1995), Kattner (1996), and Gabriel (1989).

post-harvest tuna work, copra processing, coir making, etc. are also monitored and supervised by these Bodudathas. All the people of a village gather in *Baemedu*, the assembly, and the islanders, for any island-related matter, gather in *havaruh*, the common island assembly. The village head woman (any of the two) calls for a *havaruh* through an announcement. The *havaruh* is headed by the Kateeb or Amin called *Veringh* (Hoon 2003)*.* The assembly is called on the occasions of hauling or launching of an *Odi* (sailing ship) or announcing an accident/death or discussing a common concern. There are peer groups of girls and boys of the same age called *Vili*; and each age/gender group is assigned specific tasks.

# **Religious Norms**

There is one *maszid* (mosque) found in each village and its Imam/head is called "Kateeb". He is one who maintains the birth and death registers, performs marriages, settles marriage discord and counsels in all legal matters relating to property inheritance and transfer according to *sharia* law of Islam. The *Kateeb* has six male and an equal number of female attendants to assist him during funeral activities. Female attendants look after activities relating to funeral rituals of deceased women, whereas male attendants take care of funeral rituals of deceased males.

# *Islamic Identity5*

Islanders of Minicoy belong to the Wahabi sect of Islam. They are quite different in their beliefs as compared to the other islanders of Lakshadweep, who mainly belong to Sunni sect of Islam. Wahabism was introduced to them by Hussein Didi, an exile from the Maldives in 1940s. The Wahabism is a different sect in the Sunni section in which the worshipping the Mazar (mausoleum) is strictly prohibited.

Interpretations given by various researchers show that the ancestors of the Lakshadweep and Minicoy islanders were either Hindus or Buddhists who later on accepted Islam (Gabriel 1989). At present, all the islanders of the Lakshadweep follow Islam. To trace out the roots of Islam in Minicoy, one must go through the history of Maldives as well as Cannanore and Lakshadweep.

The islands of Lakshadweep were on the major maritime trade route from Arab to Maldives including Malabar and Ceylon and to the Bay of Bengal. It may be possible that due to major trade routes passing through it, Muslim traders of Arabian countries landed on the island. Those visits and interactions helped islanders to follow Islam in Minicoy.

The spread of the Islam among the islanders dates back to AD 663 when an Arabian Islamic saint named Ubaidullah reached Amini Island of Lakshadweep. He

<sup>5</sup>Based on Gabriel (1989) and Suad (2004).

was the grandson of Siddique-ul-Akbar, an important Islamic personality in Arabian countries. Saint Ubaidullah was on the mission to spread the message of Islam but mistakenly landed at Amini, when his vessel sank due to a storm. He started his preaching but faced strong oppositions from the islanders. Initially a female of the Pondambelli family first accepted the Islam and subsequently the islanders of Andrott, Kavaratti and Agatti, and the entire Lakshadweep population converted to Islam. His grave is found in a mosque at Andrott and people respect him a lot.

Apart from the Lakshadweep Islands, it was also found that the Sultan Muhammad, king of Maldives, formerly known as Dhovemi Kalaminja accepted Islam in the year 1153 AD and converted into Muslim from Buddhist (Bell 1940/1985). These two facts support that Islam was somehow spread in Minicoy prior to the thirteenth century.

# **Existence of Matrilineal System Along with Islam**

Marco Polo referred to Minicoy as the "female island" because of its matrilineal society (Bhatt and Bhargav 2006: 50). The house and the land were retained with the women and passed along the female lines according to the custom. Both men and women take on their mother's surname identified with the name of the house. For example, a house is named Bebegothi. The male and female children born in the family take the name of the house, say Sabeeha Bebegothi and Hassan Bebegothi, respectively. Their houses are also in their mother's name. Upon marriage, the husband takes the wife's surname. For example, if Hasan Bebegothi married Faseela Olethere Gothi, then his name would change to Hassan Olethere Gothi. Most of the affairs of a household are managed by senior female members.

Tribal women in Minicoy Island significantly contribute to the management of the family; they not only sustain their culture and tradition but also administer the family. They have been instrumental due to their innate ability to reason and dispense wisdom. They are also considered wise because they plan for the teachings of children. The men are allowed to articulate, enforce and deliver these teachings; but it is the women who monitor and allow them to speak (see Skyhawk 2012).

Stark (2013) published an article on matrilineal society of the Minangkabau of West Sumatra, in which he attempted to interpret theoretically the dynamics in Islamic matrilineal society. He quoted the *adat* (the local custom, tradition or habit; cf. Vijayakumar 1999) observed in the Islamic societies as rendered by two famous scholars: Taufik Abdullah and Frederick Errington (quoted in Stark 2013: 1–13). The former one argued that in an indigenous society, the customary law (*adat*) is able to integrate new elements, whereas the latter scholar stressed that the *adat* has core and peripheral elements in society that adopted or converted to a new religion.

The two main concerns for the existence of matrilinity among the Minicoy islanders are the profession and limited land and natural resources in the island. Islanders of Lakshadweep, including Minicoy and islanders of Maldives, are ancient seafarers. Most of the men of the islands spend the major part of life away from their

island. The responsibilities of family and society were taken care of by the female counterparts. Because of limited land area, they did not have agricultural and other natural resources. It is supposed that they developed a social norm in which they handed the social power to the female, who handled the responsibilities in their absence and managed the island society. It is also presumed that this matrilineal norm existed even before their acceptance of Islam. In historical reports published by famous traveller Ibn Battuta of the fourteenth century, it is revealed that influence of women in the Maldivian governance was strong (Reynolds 1975). Hence, island society remained predominantly matrilineal after they converted to Islam (see Suad 2004 for woman's place in Islamic cultures); they followed Islamic tenets along with their social custom, i.e. their *Adat*.

# **Conclusion**

The islanders of Minicoy have faced several natural disasters like cyclones and tsunami and were invaded by of different rulers till it became a part of India. Things changed drastically with the time in terms of modernization in their livelihoods and thoughts. One most important thing which they have preserved is ancestral culture and customs. They also give an example of real democracy not only at the village level but also at island as a whole. In the present context also, they obey the suggestions given by the village house as and when needed.

In the present day context, it is a matter of pride that male members identify themselves with their female counterparts. The positive administration of the females in all aspects proves that it is an inborn quality which has passed from one generation to another. In our country, we are now initiating various women empowerment programmes; however the islanders demonstrate by retaining the value of women in the society more than men.

The people of Minicoy Island are ardent followers of Islam. Nevertheless, they also follow traditional customs and practices relating to society, livelihood and resource management. The adopted religious identity has not changed the core traditional practices like matrilinity and sociopolitical organization. The change and continuity at the core and periphery frame support the theory given by Frederick Errington as is discussed in Stark (2013).
