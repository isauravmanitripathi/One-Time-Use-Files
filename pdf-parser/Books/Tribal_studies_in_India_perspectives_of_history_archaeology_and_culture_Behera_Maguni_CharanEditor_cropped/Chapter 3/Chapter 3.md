**Abstract** This chapter approaches the historical understanding of preliterate communities with Nyishis of Arunachal Pradesh as a case study by applying both historical and anthropological sources and methods. While reconstructing the historical past of a community, the chapter reveals a process of interaction with other communities and explains the process of 'othering' and the emergence of new identity. The chapter is critical about the use of a particular disciplinary approach or source materials like oral tradition while reconstructing the history of preliterate communities and advocates for multidisciplinary approaches by combining archaeology, history, ethnology, ethnotoponymy, ethnopolity and social and cultural anthropology under one rubric. The insider and outsider debate though implicit; the chapter aims at attempting an objective frame of analysis within ethnohistorical perspective to reconstruct composite history of the nation even when a scholar studies one's own community.

## **Prologue**

History of Arunachal Pradesh is marked by abundant but undocumented historical sources, such as oral traditions, cultural anthropological data, linguistic documents, ethnoarchaeological data and ethno-technological materials. When the methods of oral traditions are applied to study preliterate and simple societies, the ethnohistory which emerges as an academic engagement very often has either a truncated or scholarly representations by overemphasising simplicity of communities. Tribes tell their past history among themselves, and writers or researchers have hardly

bothered to incorporate such ethnohistory into the mainstream composite history of the country. Consequently, such sections of societies have lacked a nationally perceived history and cultural identity. Despite rigorous academic exercises to present comprehensive information on the indigenous peoples' history, these often have ended up with either distorted or truncated depiction. As a result, most often general and catchy analyses on the people's history and culture are being available on the ethnohistorical research in Arunachal Pradesh. The development of ethnohistory in Arunachal Pradesh has of late corresponds with a growing awareness of understanding of oral traditions by both outsider and insider researchers. There is also more and more awareness of the transdisciplinary approaches to appreciate the history of the Arunachalees which in fact is equally essential for understanding the precolonial history of North East India. Findings of ethnohistorical, ethnological and archaeological researches, therefore, must be interpreted in an historical context that is provided by a composite Arunachal history to construct ethnohistory of the people. To understand and appreciate the native history, i.e., the ethnohistory in a right perspective, ethnohistorians have a crucial role to play in evolving multidisciplinary approaches drawing on archaeology, history, ethnology, ethnotoponymy, ethnopolity and social and cultural anthropology under one rubric while constructing the ethnohistory of the indigenous communities which are still under-tapped and unexplored. In view of the above, the main focus of the paper is to attempt a critical review of the available works to define the meaning of the ethnohistory and apply it to investigate the legends and myths of the *Aabhu Thanyi*<sup>1</sup> which are preserved by different descendant groups who are largely populated in the central part of Arunachal Pradesh.

The affluence in oral traditions to be collected in the State is an intricate and challenging task. About 26 major tribes and numerous small tribes who maintain similar but distinct customs and practices reside in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. Out of these 26 major tribes, only 4 tribes, namely, the Monpa (*the Bodic script*), the Khampti (*the Mon-Tai script*), the Memba (*the Hikor script*) and the Khamba (*the Hingna script*), have the scripts and written records which could be scrutinized to reconstruct their past, while the rest of the tribes, particularly *Aabhu Thanyi*<sup>2</sup> groups,

<sup>1</sup>Tani is the name of the ancestor and Abo/Abu means 'father'. In the tradition of the communities, Abo Tani is used as a proper name. In many earlier writings and even in some recent writings, the same spelling, Abo Tani, is adopted. However, in a few recent writings, the proper name is spelt as *Aabhu Thanyi* and perhaps considered unique and representative in nature. That is why the fashion of writing *the Aabhu Thyani* is in vogue (editor).

<sup>2</sup>Tribes like the Nyishi, the Apatani, the Tagin, the Galo and the Adi claim their origin from a common ancestor called the *Aabhu Thanyi.* Therefore, these tribes display a great degree of similarities in terms of cultural traits and political and social organizations even in their present-day lives. Their customary practices, indigenous religious institutions and social values for *svbe* (ceremonial ox or/*bos gaurus/ bos frontalis*) are undoubtedly similar across geographical barriers and distances between settlements. The groups also maintain the same narratives about the origin and evolution of this graceful animal, *svbe*, among them. Although tribes like the Aka (Hrusso), the Bongru, the Nah, the Bori and the Bokar trace their ancestry slight differently, still the essence is not much different from the *Aabhu Thanyi* groups. There is still a questionable tradition being maintained by some of these small groups of clans and tribes relating to a common ancestor which is under further investigation.

do not have any script and thus written records of the past. In the absence of written records, they have a typical and powerful method of preserving social memory in the forms of various poems, folktales, rhapsodies, folklores, folksongs and so forth with historical contents. These oral traditions are transmitted from one generation to the next by word of mouth. It is generally acknowledged that the study of preliterate society is ineluctably determined to some degree by the differing opinions about the crucial social and cultural questions that are held by subsequent generations. These effects pervade the ethnohistorians not directly but rather through the highly diverse academic and cultural background of individual researchers. They reorganize frames of theory that have previously had a long and intricate link with ethnohistory. Given such complexities that influence the growth of academic exercises, we must take care to discern false reasons in the works of the earlier researchers and cultural anthropologists in the state. It is much more problematic to illustrate that the attitudes of earlier researchers to the indigenous peoples were not objectively thoughtful; rather they were essentially aimed at studying the local culture and history to accomplish their academic requirements more than an objective approach to the study. Nevertheless, by carrying out their academic pursuits, earlier researchers have systematically documented some vital information which indigenous scholars as well as social scientists and cultural anthropologists now highly value them. Some anthropologists have also sought to draw readers' attention to unjust portrayal of indigenous people while pretending to be fair in their objective study of these people. As a matter of reality, these kinds of academic works may now be presented as over-sympathized and patronized attitudes shown towards the native peoples. Hence, we must be able to recognise the errors and shortcomings which are inherent in earlier phases of anthropological, sociological and other researchers' writings on the peoples. With this background, the paper tries to examine the 'homogeneity' in cultural and religious practices with reference to genealogies among various phratries of the *Aabhu Thanyi* group of tribes by using available oral traditions. In doing so, the paper particularly attempts to explore the ethnohistory of Arunachal Pradesh.

### **Meaning and Early Trends of Ethnohistory**

So far as ethnohistorical studies are concerned, there are complex and serious issues to be addressed before defining a conclusive role for ethnohistory within the realm of the social sciences. In Western experience, not long ago, it was debated whether ethnohistory is a separate discipline, a branch of anthropology or of history or a technique for analysing particular kind of data. (McBryde 1979: 146). In the same tone, it was queried whether ethnohistory is related more closely to anthropology or to history or is a sort of bridge or no-man's land between these two disciplines (Trigger 1982: 2). One of the leading exponents of ethnohistory, Bernard S. Cohn views ethnohistory as the history and cultural study of any non-European people resorting to oral traditions and archaeological sources with the conceptual framework (Cohn 1968: 440–441). He makes a difference between ethnohistorians and colonial historians and maintains that ethnohistorians generally have first-hand experience and knowledge about native society and of how it functioned. Meanwhile, E. W. Voegelin attempts to give a working definition of ethnohistory; he puts it as 'the study of identities, locations, contacts, movements, numbers, and cultural activities of preliterate peoples from the earliest written records concerning them'(Voegelin 1954: 168). However, Trigger suggests that ethnohistory is the ethnographic reconstruction of early historic cultures or what has been called 'historical ethnography' and the study of native culture change since the time of European contact. This tacit accords that ethnohistory uses documentary evidence and oral traditions to study changes in non-literate societies. (Trigger, op cit.). Nancy Lurie observes that ethnohistory is 'the use of historical records in regard to pre-literates, non-industrialised peoples, or whatever term may be preferred for those groups who are the traditional concern' (Lurie 1961: 78). Some other would argue that ethnohistorians have to remain practising ethnographers. It is worthwhile to note that ethnohistorians are required to master the art of using the knowledge of historical and anthropological data and integrated methodological approaches. Generally, ethnohistory by its own right has been developed as the study of change among indigenous peoples as opposed to history, which studies the activities of Europeans both before and after they settled elsewhere throughout the world.

Amidst these several viewpoints on the meaning and use of the term ethnohistory, it is worth mentioning that the *Aabhu Thanyi* groups of tribes are non-literate communities who do not possess any scripts to write their history and culture although they have their time immemorial traditions, past events and history of their own rights. All the events of probably prehistorical and proto-historical thrust have hardly been recorded but are maintained in the form of a social mnemonics device in traditions in varying degrees. While attempting to explain the utility and possible meaning of the ethnohistory once, Bernard L. Fontana aptly said: 'ethnohistory is the study of the past of non-literate groups as gleaned from the records of literate people with whom they come into contact. In other words, it is the history of nonliterate peoples as written by someone else' (Fontana 1961: 10). Meanwhile, by explaining the complexity of doing ethnohistory, William N. Fenton observes that 'practice of ethnohistory is about as difficult to outline and makes explicit as it is impossible to tell how an ethnologist goes about field work in the society of a living culture' (Fenton 1962: 11). In line with these perspectives, we discuss the ethnohistory of Arunachal Pradesh whose majority of tribes are non-literate or preliterate; they have no history as yet by taking cue of the above definitions on the term.

It is on this background of working definition that this paper attempts to study the emerging scope of ethnohistory in Arunachal Pradesh. Since history is half the essence of ethnohistory, historians are invaluable partners in its approaches and methodology. Now historians and anthropologists have no difficulty in accepting that ethnohistory is essentially the use of historical methods and materials to gain knowledge of the nature and causes of change in the culture and history of indigenous people, particularly tribes of Arunachal Pradesh.

The complex and challenging task of collecting source materials in order to construct the ethnohistory of Arunachal Pradesh is that written sources are scantily available only from the early part of thirteenth century. A number of these written sources again developed with the advent of the Ahom who ruled the Brahmaputra Valley for about 600 years as the first colonizer of this part of the North East India. Later, the British tactically dislodged them from the monarchical position in the Valley and started recording some of chosen ethnographical information of groups and tribes. These are followed by other European travellers and explorers, which are more or less prejudiced, because these authors did not properly comprehend the history and culture of the people whom they studied. It is in this context that ethnographical data would be usefully employed to correct these biases and reconstruct the ethnohistory of the tribes. All said and done, the fact is that very little has been written on the indigenous people of the State. Most of these earlier writings were largely in articles, reports or notes in periodicals, now impossible to obtain and difficult to consult and are often official publications which have been casually preserved. However, a few works of the early nineteenth century such as those of W. Robinson, J. Butler, E.T. Dalton, R. Wilcox and T.T. Cooper are today archival pieces. We are to appreciate one fact that these authors were mostly administrators, explorers, soldiers and missionaries, albeit they were not anthropologists or trained scholars. Even Dalton, who wrote *Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal* (1872), was not an anthropologist in the technical sense. Their information is not always correct, and these are most often heavily loaded by personal bias; some of these again are obviously guess works (Elwin 1959: xv). In spite of errors and prejudice, their works are early contributions to the ethnohistorical studies (Barpujari 1980: 2) and are of immense value to scholars and researchers of colonial history and ethnohistory of the State.

As a matter of fact, during earlier and later periods, the European explorers and travellers of the nineteenth century held the notion of the 'noble-savage' for the native people. Thus, their opinions on the tribes were low ones, and their view points were all too frequently patronizing or scornful (Elwin, *op cit*.). Even the earnest writers took the same view on the native tribesmen. J. Butler, in his noted work *A Sketch of Assam* (1874), described the Khamptis as 'a discontented, restless, intriguing tribe', the Singphos as 'a rude treacherous people' and the Adis (Abors) 'as void of delicacy as they are of cleanliness' (Butler 1874: 52–53). In 1844, E.A. Rowlatt, who explored the Mishmi Hills, portrayed the Mishmi Tribe as 'disgustingly dirty, with the exception of a few of the Chiefs, they are seldom washed from one year's end to another' (Rowlatt 1845: 476), while Robinson spoke of the Nyishi 'as having ugly countenances and a somewhat ferocious appearance' (Robinson 1851: 126). Likewise, Beresford described the Adis as 'truculent and aggressive … like all savages' (Beresford 1881: 12). Apart from these writers, Dalton's attitude towards the tribes, however, was very different, and he foreshadowed the new frame of mind of respect, interest and affection that in the main governed the relations of literate and preliterates in the modern world (Elwin, op cit. xvii). On the other hand, quite often, we are inclined to estimate that Mackenzie's study in terms of relations of specific tribes of the State with the British contains an

ethnohistory. The whole essence of Mackenzie's work provided rich ethnic information or event-wise facts and data for ethnohistorical studies; but even then it cannot be considered ethnohistory in full sense of the term (Mackenzie 1989: 12). The chief concerns of most of these early general studies of the British explorers and administrators were to collect or record the general ethnic information to the extent of its administrative use.

In a precise sense of the term, proper ethnohistorical research has not yet been started in Arunachal Pradesh. Till recent past, most of the professional researchers and social anthropologists were interested only in the conventional studies of history and culture of the tribes and their relations with the British imperial power. It is up to the *etic* (based on an outside observer's objective understanding) dilettantes, a few local professionals and government officials who collected oral traditions and brought out some kind of articles, monographs and pamphlets. Anthropologists and archaeologists pursued their own researches to study ecological settings, geomorphologic formation, geophysical position and various tribal groups, their origins, migration, heritage, etc. (Raikar and Chatterjee 1980: 1) but had less interest in ethnohistorical data, while anthropologists largely dealt with social and political structures and belief systems of the peoples with a much synchronic framework. Linguists were few who could study only a few languages of tribes of the State so far. Oral traditions which had never been collected or studied were tracked down on a few major communities, and such studies were published. Some of these works obviously tried to reconstruct the earlier biased records of material sources by better understanding and throwing a great deal of light on the thought and poetic imagination of tribes about whom little has hitherto been written (Elwin 1958: ix). This effort has now led to comprehending many more written sources, notably with the publications of several researches carried out by *emic* (relating to a culture-specific system of thought based on indigenous definitions) researchers and upcoming scholars.

In recent times, oral traditions are collected more than ever; and there is crucial concern with the theoretical questions relating to their values as historical documents. It is perceived now that in order to make a useful collection of these materials, the cultures, customs and the languages of the tribes, and from where the traditions are to be gathered, must be known beforehand. Ethnohistory was not part of early anthropological study on the tribes of the State. Instead, most of the social anthropologists sought to study their physical variations, traditional institutions and languages. Besides, no sincere attempt was made to study the changes in native peoples' lives that had resulted from European contact. Anthropologists inclined to attach any change taking place among the indigenous population to European connection without studying the process. They usually understand that prior to such exposure, the culture of these tribes had been relatively static, stable and unchanging. In recent decades only a little importance has been attached to the study of native culture and ethnological information. Anthropologist like C.V.F. Haimendorf published his work, *The Apa Tanis and Their Neighbours* (London, 1962), which has been considered as a major path-breaking in ethnographical study on any individual community of the State. Haimendorf had been inspired to begin this study by the work of Elwin's *A Philosophy for NEFA* (Shillong, 1957*)* on the tribes of Arunachal Pradesh. An awareness of the significance of understanding indigenous cultures and social institutions subsequent to British and other European touch gradually developed within 'Arunachal study' in the context of research on social, cultural, belief and ethnic dimensions. The chief aim of these studies in retrospect was to 'treat with condescension and compassionate' standpoint. These studies also sought to learn more about how tribal cultures had responded to different forms of modern civic institutions and administrative mechanism, so that they might help government's field executing agencies to formulate more effective and also more accessible policies for dealing with indigenous population. Consequently, out of these studies, some anthropologists became familiar with the necessity to understand and appreciate the tribal cultures in historical perspective and deduced that indigenous history was a subject worthy of study in view of its own right.

Of late, however, increased ethnohistorical research has been done by some indigenous scholars whose primary training and skill has been in history. These scholars have used new skills and fresh theoretical methods to study their own community history and culture, thereby supporting present studies of larger diversity and richness than that existed earlier. There have been some general tendency among the native scholars that outside researchers were incapable to appreciate and perceive the culture of the tribes from the inside viewpoint and were, therefore, unable to present their studies flawlessly and objectively, if not overtly prejudiced and derogatory. These nonindigenous ethnohistorical interpretation of tribes' history is sometimes offensive insofar as they contradict the traditional views that the tribes hold or have held about their past. The difficulties to ethnohistorians are to integrate a respectful study of traditional tribes' views of history and culture with what we regard as more 'conventional ethnohistorical investigation'. In this direction, oral traditions may play an important role in bridging the gap between these two approaches. These indigenous scholars are capable of being critical to almost every aspect of their traditional institutions, culture, religious beliefs and political life. In the recent past, some little apologetic literature is being produced that endeavours to refute claims that tribal peoples were misrepresented by earlier writers or even to set such treatment into some 'palliative historical context'. Such studies are likely to be mild and balanced in approach in dealing with the tribes' past.

There is no denying to the fact that the numerous misinterpretations about the tribes' history and culture need urgent rectifications and critique to the established a priori attitude of *etic* researchers. There are also several sweepingly disgraceful aspects of the treatment of tribes that they 'were of a most rapacious nature, and anxious for opportunities of plunder'. (Bhuyan 1990: 32). Some scholars simply label the tribes as 'band of raiders and marauders' only. It is expected these writers ought to be well informed about the historical background of relations between tribesman and the colonial administration meaningfully. Nevertheless, the incitement to twist the findings of ethnohistorical research to suit the aims of an academic objective and to quench a priori 'notional history' can only be fulfilled at the expenses of valid historical interpretation. In recent years, a large number of papers have been published in which researchers who are not well trained in ethnohistorical methods have advanced arguments based on third-hand limited knowledge of the peoples' cultures. Yet, such papers continue to be published by reputed journals. Utterly worse is the situation when books are being published by many reputed presses that seem to be based on 'chaired scholars' assortment of evidences. Researching the history and culture of preliterate peoples relying chiefly upon written materials developed by outside writers is different from writing the history of a literate people, whose activities and events have been largely documented. Thus, in dealing with indigenous peoples, there is an extra difficulty of studying wholly their cultures in right perspective. Ethnohistorians, therefore, need not only possess all the skills of a good conventional historian but also a sound knowledge of ethnology and culture-specific system, if they are to evaluate source materials and interpret them with reasonable understanding of the perceptions and inspirations of the indigenous people. Such knowledge can be derived from a wide comparative learning of individual tribe's settlement pattern and also from an understanding of traditional institutions, customs, beliefs and culture being practised by people. In order to understand properly the perceptions and inspirations of tribesman, which are often inadequately comprehended and imprecisely recorded in earlier primary sources, it is useful to compare oral traditions of specific situations that are preserved in powerful social memory by members of different communities of the State.

With respect to the methodological predicament posed by ethnohistorical research in this part of the country, a great deal has yet to be done. Broadly speaking, the trend of research is still for each specialist to study what falls into their domains and to give only a swift appreciation to the needs of ethnohistorical research proper. It is a crucial intricacy for all those researchers, for majority of them must devise new methods to grapple with the ethnohistorical methodological problems. The researchers must apply a canon of historical methods to understand oral traditions of the native societies. One must also follow certain standards when collecting the source material itself. It is exceedingly not only indispensable to know the general cultural conditions of the people whose traditions a scholar is studying but also the specific setting of every tradition. Moreover, such collected data on oral traditions must be laid down in its historical framework of reference. Scholars must also have a flawless command of the language and should essentially work in cooperation with a linguist, so that the material data gathered can be correctly and precisely understood. After doing this exercise, one must collect all the prevailing variants of the traditions, so that it would be possible to reconstruct prototype and to have a good concept of the quality of the transmitted oral sources. The construction of such illustrations includes the answers to some theoretical issues, such as the level of extrapolation one can apply to oral sources.

Each of prevalent history, ethnohistory, ethnology and archaeology has evolved its own distinct techniques and methods for collecting and analysing data about humankind and its action. Every proposition requires specialized skills and training. However, these data are to be studied and scrutinized within an ecological, historical materialist and idealist framework, and then these must also be viewed in historical circumstances. Researching the history of indigenous people needs information provided by ethnohistorians, historical linguists, physical anthropologists, prehistoric archaeologists, specialists in oral traditions and comparative ethnologists. This could be a wide range of analytical and methodological approach that may be applied in constructing the ethnohistory by ethnohistorians. It is imperative to point out that the 'Arunachaleese history' should be considered as well-grounded interdisciplinary scope in its entirety that requires valuable contributions from social anthropologists, ethnologists, prehistoric archaeologists, ethnopolity and ethnohistorians. At the same time, its status should be regarded as indispensable regional history and complement to the composite history of the country.

### **Oral Traditions and Variations**

The state of Arunachal Pradesh is home to numerous tribes with their distinct cultural identities and traditional institutions. Most of them belong to *Palaeo-Mongoloid* racial stock and speak languages of their own which are broadly classified under the *Tibeto-Burman* family of languages. Each tribe has a distinctive language but similar customary practices and beliefs system. However, cultural and language affinity has been observed among many of them. Among the indigenous tribes like the Nyishi, the Tagin, the Apatani, the Galo and the Adi, a great degree of homogeneity could be observed in their customs, beliefs and other cultural practices. A popular tradition current among these tribes maintains that they descended from the common ancestor, the *Aabhu Thanyi*, and their respective traditions which bear a high degree of similarities in terms of racial origin, migration and cultural ethos among these groups. Historically, they have always been similar, but due to their wide distributions and linguistic diversification, they settled in different parts and districts of the State. Their languages are quite akin to one another, and cultural homogeneity is discernible to varying degrees in the pattern of marriage, rituals and festivals. Despite being different groups, there is a strong underlying connection which binds them together as common descendant of a single forefather, the *Aabhu Thanyi*. Of the many *Tibeto-Burman* ethnic groups of the present-day Arunachal Pradesh, many usually trace their origin somewhere from beyond the Tibetan (China) plateau. In the absence of written records and vagueness of the oral traditions, myths, legends, rhapsodies and folktales tell about racial origin and development of genealogies among the *Aabhu Thanyi* group of tribes.

According to existing traditions maintained by the tribes' raconteurs and narrators, the evolution of organism and human race has always been centred on varying degrees of myths and legends associated with different demigod forms of the *Aabhu Thanyi.* Whenever expert narrators are asked about the myths of the *Aabhu Thanyi*, they would simply cite numerous forms of the *Aabhu Thanyi.* At the same time, with some ambiguity, the evolution of the *Nyia* (human) and animal is simultaneously narrated among different tribes of the State while trying to maintain a certain degree of uniformity in the narration of traditions.

The tribes' traditions as evolved may be dealt separately while investigating the *Aabhu Thanyi* line of genealogy. According to popular legends current among the *Thanyi* tribes, animals evolved first and in their present forms, while human evolution occurred in phases through improved transformation of genes. Whereas one of the largest tribe among the *Aabhu Thanyi* descendent groups, the Nyishi, maintains that the evolution of human and animal organism began from the same super organism. Say, for instance, from the *Nyia* (humankind) came *nichi sichi*, *nyijo sejo*, *nyilin pursing*, *nyibh rubchi*, *nyima sark* and *nyibh theo* (planets and animals evolved first which was followed by evolution of human being). In accordance with this evolutionary process, it was believed that from the union of the *Jiwth Aane*<sup>3</sup> and the *Aabhu Thanyi*, three sons, namely, the *Aathu Thanyi Nyima Loma* (the Creator of technology), the *Aathu Thanyi Nyima Thama* (the self-transformed human into tiger) and the *Aathu Thanyi Nyima Nyia* (believed to be the Progenitor of the present Human Race which populated this planet), were born. Subsequently, from the *Aathu Thanyi Nyima Nyia*, popularly called *Aathu Nyia*<sup>4</sup> or *Aathu Nyia Thaya*, all the present-day human races were believed to have evolved and inhabited different parts of the planet. Whether the *Nyima Loma*, the *Nyima Thama* and the *Nyima Nyia* were the sons of the *Jiwth Aane* or evolved earlier than present human being is not clear from the traditions of the myths across the phratries.

There is another version of traditions maintained among a few clans within the Nyishi community. It asserts that one *Nyia Haku* evolved from *Pokokhwang* (a kind of bird). With the passage of time, most probably this tradition was interpolated from the original version while making a round in a few phratries. It could be an imperceptible change not the whole or genre as traditions claim. Such traditions are required for critical scrutiny by drawing comparative testimonies available among other tribes about evolution of traditions around the *Aabhu Thanyi*. The tribes with slight variations firmly maintained that from the *Nyidae Thanyi* naming pattern by prefixing the term '*Aabhu*', meaning 'father', before the *Thanyi* appeared. Hence, hereafter the name the *Aabhu Thanyi* was used unmistakably from generation to generation till these days. Henceforth, the name *Aabhu Thanyi* was referred to as common ancestor of all the tribes which have settled in the central part of Arunachal Pradesh. It was most probably from this unrecorded *traditions period*<sup>5</sup> the legends

<sup>3</sup>The *Jiwth Aane* is believed to be a virgin mother who had given birth to the sons of the *Aabhu Thanyi* without any physical contact as maintained by the *Aabhu Thanyi* groups of communities of Arunachal Pradesh. In their indigenous religious practice, the *Jiwth Aane* represents the human form of the *Aane Donyi* (The Timeless Mother Sun, in which the present Sun is only the replica and representational living image).

<sup>4</sup>*Aathu Nyima Nyia*, meaning 'human being', is the third son of the *Aabhu Thanyi* who is shortly popular as *Aathu Nyia* in narrative traditions. The existing popular myths narrated by different lineage groups and clans maintain that from the *Aathu Nyima Nyia*, all the human being evolved and grouped into various races, tribes, phratries and lineages with different naming pattern and styles. Hence, *Aathu Nyima Nyia* son of the *Aabhu Thanyi* is the actual progenitor of human being on this planet.

<sup>5</sup>The phrase 'traditions period' is used in this paper to signify the past events of these *Aabhu Thanyi* groups of tribe who strived hard to preserve their past through a mnemonic device despite

of the *Aabhu Thanyi* have been portrayed variously attributing demigod status to the *Nyia Thanyi* and the *Nyikum Thanyi*, the characteristic representation of the *Aabhu Thanyi*, while *Uyt* or *Uyu Thanyi* was considered malevolent having constant rivalry with the *Nyia Thanyi*. As the *Aabhu Thanyi* had to maintain procreation of human race, so he looked for perfect consort for him and arranged a matrimonial relation with *Donyi Namlo* to seek the hands of the *Donyi Yayi Chumji* and the *Jiwth Aane* (both daughters of the *Donyine*). The established traditions of all tribes maintained that from this period onwards, actual human social institutions like institution of marriage, family and ownership of moveable and immovable properties as inalienable parts of the human society on this universe evolved. From this stage of human evolution, the counting of phratry genealogies is believed to have started by using *Aabhu* as prefix before the *Thanyi*, meaning thereby father. It is but natural for the tribes like the Adi, the Apatani, the Galo, the Nyishi and the Tagin to claim the *Aabhu Thanyi* as their forefather. Nevertheless, there are some degrees of variations in traditions maintained among these tribes which were noted during the field work to record the myths of the *Aabhu Thanyi* discussed as under.

The most common and popular traditions current among the *Thanyi* groups of tribes is about the maintenance of genealogy from the *Aabhu Thanyi.* This tradition is a well-established fact and beyond dispute across all regions irrespective of remoteness and distances of their inhabited territories. The fundamental root of the *Aabhu Thanyi* myths is the association of five important phratry genealogies, viz. *Achi Dopum*, *Phai Dodum*, *Paryu Dol*, *Pakhu Nyibi* and *Anyia Harri*, who were believed to be the five sons of the *Aathu Tadho*. These traditions of counting the genealogies of five sons were the bases of determining different clans and groups of cousins, kinsmen and relatives particularly among the tribes formed the *Aabhu Thanyi* descendants. On the basis of these five phratries, the entire clan system was maintained to ascertain and determine with whom to keep matrimonial relation or restriction in the society. It is maintained that from these five *phratries*, most probably, numerous sub-phratries evolved which were either extinct or assimilated into larger clan groups forming a single group during a long historical period of social transformation and changes. After analysing the identical variations in the legends and traditions of the peoples, it would seem that language proximity which is being maintained by the Adi, the Galo, the Apatani and the Tagin is similar with imperceptible variations in sound and pronunciation. The other important aspects of these tribes reveal that there are certain clans whose language and cultural practices are almost similar from East Kameng District to West Siang District of the State. Not only that, even their food habit, lifestyle, rituals, clan names and naming pattern are closely akin to one another despite their settlement in different regions.

Cultural affinity, as mentioned, corroborates to the fact that these tribes belong to a common ancestor and are of the same origin. The verbal sound system and phonetic expressions are invariably having a close similarity with negligible variations

the absence of any reading and writing knowledge among them. These traditions are difficult to equate with the European methods of periodization like ancient, medieval and modern to explain the space, time and date and to denote the development and progress of the preliterate society.

in their pronunciations from one group to another. However, these tribes could easily understand the spoken language of one another. Reasons for this variation in pronunciations and accent could be due to geographical barriers and distances of inhabited territories of different tribes.

As we know, linguistically these *Thanyi* groups of tribes speak a *Tibeto-Burman* family of language by and large. It is also observed that there are numerous myths attached with the matrimonial status of the *Aabhu Thanyi* which are quite popular among the tribes. The most common kinds of myths maintained is that of the *Aabhu Thanyi*'s having matrimonial relations with various celestial princess, viz. the *Donyi Yayi Chumji* (*A kind of Sun*), the *Jiwth Aane* (*Virgin Mother of Celestial Princess*), the *Pedong Aane* (*Celestial Princess*), the *Nyedoh Nyejone* (*Celestial Princess*), the *Nyedoh Nyekone* (*Celestial Princess*) and the *Nyedoh Loth Lodain* (*Celestial Princess*). Myths about all these princesses relate them to either above the sky or to the parentage of the sun and each of them having different characteristics, personality, quality and legend. From the veracity point of view, it is not clear whether the present stock of tribes or clans is directly related to these consorts of the *Aabhu Thanyi* in any way. It is also doubtful whether all of them were the consorts of the *Aabhu Thanyi* or not. Most probably, all these narrated myths about different celestial princess could be one or two only which might have been variously maintained by different phratries with different sobriquets while reciting their genealogies and lineages in the long run.

It would seem that there could be an interpolation about the number of consorts and also variation in naming pattern. These variations of traditions could have been passed on to the following generation without maintaining the original genre of the traditions. With the passage of time, different groups of the tribe migrated to different territories and regions in search of better homestead location, and traditions might have been gradually corrupted in order to suit the imagination of new branches of lineage or clan. As such many previously held common traditions might have been imperceptibly distorted and more new elements by the narrators or traditional raconteurs added. The difficulty and complexity to ascertain the accuracy of these traditions are further added by the absence of written records. So, we are to rely on dominant and popular traditions current among the tribes as source material and testimony to reconstruct their ethnohistory by employing the canon of historical methods and approaches. As these traditions appeared fluid, it could have been possible that the narrators in each phratry might have transmitted with some added or modified elements. In this way these traditions were transmitted to next generation by word of mouth with a degree of narrative interpolations to evolutionary explanation about the tribes' origin and migration. Remembering and reciting these traditions were the responsibility of elders, priests and experts in the society with variant degrees of ability of elocution and spontaneity.

According to people of East Kameng, Lower Subansiri, Kurung Kumey and Papum Pare Districts, the *Aathu Nyia* who happens to be the immediate ancestor was believed to have matrilineal relation with the *Donyine*. It is said that the *Donyine* (a spiritual sobriquet name of reverence), the daughter of the *Donyi* (the mother of all), married to *Aathu Nyia*. Out of the union of the *Aathu Nyia* and the *Aane*  *Donyine*, eight sons were born from which actual counting of phratry genealogy began. Out of these eight sons, only four sons' genealogy (lineages) could be remembered. Therefore, the present tribes were the descendants of any one of these eight phratries. The another version of traditions maintained by the people of Upper Subansiri District which tells that the youngest son of the *Aathu Nyia*, the *Aathu Harri*, had forefathered the *Bindung* and *Bengley* group of phratries which largely inhabited Upper Subansiri and West Siang Districts of the state. It is not a surprise to find that the tribes like the Bori, the Bokar, the Ramo and the Palibo inhabiting these districts do have a close cultural and linguistic similarity with the Tagin of Upper Subansiri District.

On the basis of close proximity in genealogical narratives, it is said that the *Nguri Ngukha* (one of the clan group under the *Achi Dopum* phratry) clan is the immediate offspring of *Bengley* phratry having a close lineage link with the group of the Tagin called *Chirum.* This *Chirum* was the elder brother of *Chera* who formed the *Chera* clan of the Nyishi, and its descendants settled in Payeng and Taliha Administrative Circle of Upper Subansiri District. As claimed by the clan members, a few of them migrated towards the western part of the territory and are identified as *Takke*, *Rare*, *Tadar*, *Tayar*, *Tanya*, *Tarh* and *Tayo*. This *Chera* clan separated from the *Chirum* clan long time ago, but both the groups could still maintain their genealogy intact, and even these days, they remember the lost brothers. Majority of people from the *Chirum* clan have settled in left bank of the *Syinik* river (Subansiri), and they trace their genealogy from *Haring Ringdo Tadho* through *Achi Dopum*, *Phai Dodum*, *Paryu Dol*, *Pakku Nyibi* and *Anyia Harri*. It would seem that most probably the *Bindung* and *Bengley* groups of clans are the descendants of the *Anyia Harri*, the last son of the *Aathu Tadho*.

### **Overview of Myths Mothers**

It is evident from the above discussion that the present groups of *Bindung* and *Bengley* clans are the immediate offspring of the second line of the *Aathu Anyia Harri*, the last son of the *Aathu Tadho* and not from the offspring of the *Aathu Harri*, the son of the *Aathu Nyia.* While drawing from variant versions of traditions current among different clans, it is maintained that they were the grandchildren of the *Aabhu Thanyi*. Now the pertinent question is: If they were the grandchildren of the *Aabhu Thanyi*, then what about the other phratries like *Hagung* (*Haghy*), *Habing* (*Heyin*), *Hatto* (*Hallo*), *Hazz* (*Hebe*) and *Hagum* (*Haku*) who are largely settled in Kurung Kumey District? This question is often raised: Who was the forefather of these phratries? In the similar way, the *Bongru* and *Pisa* clans' forefather is also shrouded in mystery, and generally other large tribes like the Nyishi usually consider themselves as *Nyedone Ku* (meaning the sons of the sky princess), but not children of the *Aabhu Thanyi* lineage. Sometimes, they relate them to *Nyedoh Loth Lodane* (*Celestial Princess*) who was believed to have mothered the *Aathu Pakku Nyibi*, and from him, clans like the *Bongru* and the *Pisa* were born. It is also argued that the *Aathu Tadho* had an informal matrimonial relation with *Nyedoh Namlo* (the family of Celestial Princess) and married to *Nyedoh Nyejone* or *Nyedoh Tyetwre* (a tattooed Celestial Princess), the elder sister of *Nyedoh Loth Lodane.* It is believed that the *Aathu Tadho* and *AaneNyedoh Nyejone* had parented two sons, namely, the *Jonne* and the *Rongne.* From the *Jonne*, the present day the Aka (Hrusso) tribe descended while the Miji tribe from the *Rongne*. As the traditions claimed, these tribes were the descendants of the *Aathu Tadho* who first institutionalized the marriage system called *tadho helly* (beginning of patriarchal marriage system among the *Aabhu Thanyi* tribes)*.* From the traditions period onwards, the formal marriage system started, according to which a boy seeks the hands of a girl for marriage. It is believed that the customary practice of *geryi nwl tunam* (looking for a bride or selection of a bride) started along with methods of examining chicken and pig liver omen in the primordial society of the tribes. So, the *Aathu Tadho* ardently followed this practice of marriage system and subsequently married to *AaneGaryi Mwirpumtore* (Mother of *Aathu Dopum*), *Aane Mwirpumdum* (Mother of *Aathu Dodum*), *Aane Lodarne* (Mother of *Aathu Dol*) and *AaneLoth Lodaine* (Mother of *Aathu Nyibi*). Later, *Aathu Tadho* also married to the daughter of *Jyinyir Jyenai* (an expert artist) who is said to have created the precious ornaments and material items like beads, gongs, bracelets, etc. which were inherited from generations to generations since then. The *Aathu Tadho* married *Geryi Lonney*, and from their union the son *Aathu Anyia Harri* was born.

It is interesting to note that most of the tribes in the state attached their sibling status and prestige on the basis of their respective mother's social background and antecedent genealogy. In line with this, there was an established notion of distinguishing among the brothers of the family on the basis of their mothers' social status, matrimonial paraphernalia involved and ceremonies conducted. Therefore, the sons of the *Aathu Tadho* like *Aathu Nyibi*, *Aathu Jonne* and *Aathu Rongne* whose mother was *Aane Nyedoh Nyejone* (*Nyedoh Tyetwre*) were generally treated with disparaging social status by the children of the mothers *Aane Mwirpumtore*, *Aane Mwirpumdum*, *Aane Lodarne* and *Aane Loth Lodaine* in the society. Similarly, the Nyishi also considered the *Bangru* and the *Puroik* (Sulung) as sons of the mother *Aane Nyedohne* or *Aane Dojji* (*Celestial Daughter*) who was treated as alien to human society. In view of this foregoing discussion*,* whatsoever may be the social antecedents we may note that the *Aathu Nyibi*, the *Aathu Jonne* and the *Aathu Rongne* all were the legitimate children of the legendary forefather the *Aathu Tadho* like other children of the *Aathu Dopum*, the *Aathu Dodum*, the *Aathu Dol*, the *Aathu Nyibi* and the *Aathu Anyia Harri*.

In conclusion, it can be stated that dealing with the subject like genealogies and tracing the origin of each tribe and clan is a gigantic academic exercise and needs an in-depth investigation on each traditions and testimonies to reconstruct the ethnohistory of these tribes. One aspect of maintaining the logic of social purity and status among these tribes is often attached with nature and standard of matrimonial relations at the time of solemnizing marriage ceremony which were often referred to as *Aane hanam* (Counting of Mother). Another important aspect is adoption of language and culture of own mother's side which gives basic tenet of involving cross-cousin marriage in their societies. These practices are quite prevalent among many of the *Aabhu Thanyi* tribes even these days. As such, the use of popular terms like *Dopum*, *Dodum* and *Dol* among the Adi, the Galo, the Tagin and the Mishing tribe of Assam ascertains that they belonged to the same stock as the children of the *Aathu Tadho* with the *Aabhu Thanyi* as common ancestor.

It is also observed that the style of naming pattern is almost the same except a few cases of using surnames by suffixing names of their grandfathers or past ancestors. Reasons for this have been plausibly explained by the tribes that it developed due to effect of gradual formation of new clans from earlier single clan through numerous lineages in the course of time. Besides, geographical factors, lack of education and communication bottlenecks led to variation of language, culture, customs, rituals, beliefs and housing patterns. However, one vital element of affinity and homogeneity among them is rearing of the *svbe* (ceremonial ox or/*bos gaurus/ bos frontalis*) which they use as medium of exchange for all purposes, whether it is marriage or peace negotiation to ease social tension in the village or among tribes since time immemorial. This is the whole epitome and marker of the *Thanyiness* among these different tribes who have settled largely in the central part of Arunachal Pradesh and follow the same indigenous religion, although with different names. Nonetheless, each tribe has its own name for its warship places, viz., the *Nyedar Namlo* is for the Nyishi, the *Ganging* is for the Adi, the *Kargu Gamgi* is for the Galo, the *Meder Nello* is for the Apatani and the *Donyi Polo Namlo* is for the Tagin. All these indigenous religious institutions are functioning under the aegis of the *Donyi Polo* religion in the State. Now these tribes proudly claim that they could still maintain the rich cultural and religious heritage of the *Aabhu Thanyi* even in this twenty-first century. In a nutshell, this paper is a preliminary attempt to reconstruct the myths of the *Aabhu Thanyi* by drawing on various versions of traditions being preserved by different tribes who claim the *Aabhu Thanyi* as their common ancestor.
