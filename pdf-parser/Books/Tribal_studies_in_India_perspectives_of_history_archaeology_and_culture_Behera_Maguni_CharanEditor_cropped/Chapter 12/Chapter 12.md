**Abstract** Conventionally, in rock art studies, the emphasis is focused on style, motifs and techniques. But in recent years, there is a growing body of work that recognizes the importance of interpreting rock art not only within the context of the rockscape, but within a holistic context that includes a more accurate view of prehistoric culture, information from contemporary indigenous people, their ethnography, culture and material and non-material culture, etc. In view of this, the chapter emphasizes on ethnographic source in rock art research, for there are many ethnographic sources that can be used meaningfully to examine the rock art, especially to interpret the subjective matters in them.

In the historical journey of human civilization, there were inventions during the early phase (prehistoric phase) which are central to any change occurred in different periods of time for human development. We can mention of the invention of fire and wheel as examples. Also the invention that human had made during this period in the form of stone tools not only proclaims his/her intellectual capacity but puts the signature of his/her superiority over other living beings. In other words, during this period, human creativity distinguished their life from the life of animals. Many of his/her inventions and discoveries still inspire admiration and awe in today's civilized world. One of such human creativities is rock art which has been in existence ever since they appeared.

In recent academics there is a methodological shift in studying rock art. Due to this shift, the past of the people with whom the art is associated or with whose tradition a similarity continues is attempted to be constructed. In the process of this, construction ethnography of these people is found useful in combination with archaeological methods.

With this backdrop the present paper argues that a study of living cultural practices, rock art and paintings to be specific, could be useful in reconstructing the past of early humans. In view of this, the study is organized within the analytical frame of ethnoarchaeology in five sections. Section 12.1 focuses on rock art as a tool to unravel past. In other words, it outlines the importance of rock art to study the past in brief. Section 12.2 outlines methodological shift in archaeology to study rock arts. In Sect. 12.3 we have presented some cases of living traditions drawing on Australia and Africa to show the significance of ethnoarchaeology to reconstruct the past. In Sect. 12.4 some examples from India have been presented. Section 12.5 concludes the discussion.

## **Rock Art: A Tool to Reconstruct the Past**

Rock art is one of the most brilliant works of early humans. There are myriads of knowledge engrafted in rock art which resulted into the emergence of new or additional discipline in archaeology advocating great concern for rock art. Firstly, because evidences of early time are less in variety, dependency for reconstructing human past mainly falls upon stone tools. Significantly, the stone tools supply visual activities of the early man (Chippindale and Taçon 1998), and undoubtedly, the phenomenon multiplies the importance of studying rock art. We indeed get ample information about the dark phase of human history due to diversified knowledge within rock art. The characteristics of knowledge creation as embodied in the rock art make its study very interesting and at the same time challenging too. Secondly, rock art is a global phenomenon (Kumar 2015). Rock art is like an art gallery of past time where images in thousands have been depicted on walls of all available ancient mountain rocks around the world. Many rock art features such as overlapping of images, articulation of images, style and techniques, location of the rock art landscape and many more are truly global in nature. Rock art has always occurred in every cultural development of human history which actually tends to answer many unsolved questions of corresponding periods. It gives the sequential evidence of human evolution. Thirdly, a special place may be given to rock art owing to its direct imaginary/psychological reflection of early human life. In this context the study of rock art can answer questions related to the emergence of culture, civilization, development of the human brain, etc. The relevant questions in this regard are: Did development of human's creative power follow the same process from tool maker to rock art artist around the world? What was his/her creative imagination? What did he/she think at each stage of development of his/her creative power? What made him/her to think so? Answers to these questions are embedded in rock art. In fact rock arts are some real manifestations of early human psychology. Fourthly, rock art is not only a worldwide phenomenon, but it also covers a wide time span from prehistoric period to historic period that also maintains the chronological development of human culture.

## **Methodological Shift**

Rock art is a field of study in archaeology discipline. Archaeological researches, however, have undergone many changes methodologically thereby expanding its scope and content of enquiry. Such a change is noticed especially in the field of rock art which has witnessed tremendous improvement. Those improvements have been recorded in the research methods and techniques of rock art in all the twofold areas, viz. in the area of data collection, analysis of subject-matters, motif designs and the field of interpretation. It is however mentioned that these changes have occurred more frequently and significantly in the field of interpretation, rather than in the area of data collection (findings of new rock art sites) and documentation of motifs and designs which initially was done in accelerated mode. Deciphering the meaning out of the rock art is not an easy task; it is a challenge to be addressed with specialized knowledge. Therefore, traditional methods of archaeology somewhere failed to give rational answers. Rock art is not an art for art sake; but it is an intangible part of human culture. The conventional method of study could not provide tools to unravel it in context.

The interpretation of rock art is an ambitious venture for the historians, archaeologists and anthropologists alike. The absence of supportive historical resources of rock art makes it more difficult. It is the disciplinary frame of history that makes the interpretation difficult. The answer to how one can understand rock art is possible only by knowing history through present situation (since there is no written record of that time). It is like walking backward from present to past or from known to unknown. But history has its limitation of going beyond recorded past. Obviously this perspective of history further worsens in dealing with the prehistoric rock art where additional historical evidences are narrowing down.

However, the images of rock art give ample information about the primal stages of cultural development. Since that period does not have enough historical resources, hence other methods are being applied by the scholars of different subject disciplines including archaeology and even history. This is quite clear that rock art is the subject of history because it is the work of early man. But history is not only the study of past time. History is the meaningful record of human achievements even in the contemporary period. It is not merely a list of chronological events but a truthful integrated account of the relationship between persons, events, times and place (Sharma 2001). Therefore, in many cases, we use the present situation to understand the past and to try to understand the present in light of the past event and development (see Clegg 1993).

Archaeologists employ ethnographic method to study the contemporary societies, their material culture and the material consequences of their behaviour for the purpose of formulating and strengthening analogy for use in the interpretation of archaeological evidence. Ethnography has bearing on the rendition of rock art since it tries to correlate analogy of both past and present. The basic values of humans, such as the belief system, rituals, concept of family and marriage, phobic attitude for unknown powers, etc., have gradually formulated and remained slightly

unchanged over the years. These unchanged human values are present even today to a greater extent in rural and indigenous societies. Paintings and drawings are primary organs of human culture. Time has only changed its techniques and style, not the subjects. The characteristic of human nature in terms of painting may become a vital ethnographic method for interpreting rock art. Interestingly, use of ethnographic data and their comparisons and interpretation into archaeology have a long history (Cummings et al. 2014). The ethnographic method is an emerging frontier for the interpretation of rock art in contemporary academics, and this methodological innovation has developed the ethnoarchaeology branch of knowledge. This method helps in interpreting the past because:

- 1. Traditional archaeological methods are not sufficient to interpret rock art. Rock art research has experienced radical change. This means that our substantive knowledge of the world's rock art, the techniques that we use to study it and the interpretive models we bring to its understanding are all changing rapidly (Whitley 1990). Therefore, in the flow of such changes, conventional archaeological methods are limiting the research areas and its findings.
- 2. Rock art conflates both tangible and intangible culture. The intangible aspects of the rock art are imbedded in our society. Human psychology, behavioural patterns, belief system, etc. have not changed substantially. The San Bushman also show the array of rock art from prehistoric period to mid of the nineteenth century, with regional variation in style and subjects, yet the core religious ceremonies – the healing trance dance – is always present and still continues (Lewis-Williams and Challis 2011).
- 3. The indigenous people are also found engaged in the study of rock art. Participation of the indigenous peoples in the international academic rock art conferences is also adding new approach to understand rock art in their own term. Robert Bednarik (founder of the Australian Rock Art Research Association (AURA) and co-founder of the International Federation of Rock Art Organisations (IFARO)) said that for the first time, the indigenous people addressed the major academic event in 1988 on rock art (see Ross 2001).
- 4. To understand the rock art motifs and symbols in holistic manner in which rock art is interpreted is not from a detailed analysis of the motifs itself but within a holistic context that includes a more accurate view of hunter-gatherer culture, landscape, information from contemporary native people, style, motif, historical ethnography and cultural materials (Ross 2001).
- 5. The hunter-gatherer society of prehistoric time can best be understood through the study of contemporary hunter-gatherer society like San/Bushman (Africa), Birhor, Asur and Kadar (India) and some aborigines of Australia. So, an insight into the living style of these contemporary societies and their relationships with nature, particularly forest and hunting practices, will be useful in understanding the rock art. Ross (2001) presents her argument in support of the above proposition in a relational frame of analysis with reference to rock art, land and landscape. Ross (2001) argues that landscape plays a vital role in the interpretation of rock art and forwards the following:

First, intimate relationship between hunter-gatherer society and environment/ nature resulted into comprehensive knowledge that passes from generation to generation over many years. Second, hunter-gatherer is unsettled society and therefore every corner of a big land area is like their house and courtyard in which they move with acquaintance; extract resources; use safe route for travelling across the land. Third, the importance of landscape context in the interpretation of hunter-gatherer rock art is also reflected in the location of mythic and historic events; cosmological structures; wisdom teaching and ritual symbolism within the specific landscape. Ross Mairi's (see 2001) concept of "land and landscape" in interpretation of rock art ethnography method is quite a suitable approach since the present indigenous societies treat a land as their cultural part and converge with it. The bond of human with land can be better assessed through the indigenous people and their myths, historical events, narrative, folktales and can be used to interpret rock art.

6. There is a bifurcation of the culture which appeared after Neo-Chalcolithic age. One is associated with the features like script, kingdom, warfare, army, trade, surplus production and stratification of society, whereas the other one is merged in the absence of the above said features with people and society known as tribal/ indigenous people mainly located in inaccessible and naturally unfavourable areas. As a result we can find a few tribal practices having direct relationships with the cave-painting tradition (Brooks and Wakankar 1976).

Existence of similarities, in different degrees, between many unrelated situations or phenomena is one of the universal features. Unsurprisingly, we find different things but often with properties of similarities. Ethnoarchaeology uses the tool of analogy in which events of the past and present with similar properties can be compared and understood (Cummings et al. 2014; Chippimdale and Tacon 1998). In ethnoarchaeology it is assumed that the contemporary primitive society may represent a model to understand the past stages of human culture. There is a very suitable example that tells about the principle of ethnoarchaeology. The hunters and gatherers are found even today, and unsurprisingly archaeologists have drawn extensively on ethnographic and anthropological accounts of living hunting-gathering-fishing societies to aid their interpretation of archaeological traces of such societies (Cummings et al. 2014).

7. The empirical method applied to interpret rock art earlier is based on the study and analysis of tangible images as depicted by early humans. This approach is not suitable to read the intangible part of rock art. Arguably, the method of interpretation is completely subjective, for it only collects the outer facts of visible images. It means that empirical study confines to the descriptive account of rock art images. What are the psychological dimensions attached with those images? Can they be reflected through empirical method? Empirical method has been repudiated on many grounds: (1) it is possible to record only observations that seem relevant to a hypothesis; (2) the classification of observations cannot be derived from the data alone; (3) reliable inductive reasoning from (necessarily) subjectively recorded observations is impossible; and (4) further testing is in

danger of circulatory bias because the data against which inferences are to be tested has (necessarily) been collected subjectively and in the same manner as the original data (Lewis-Williams 2006).

In a nutshell, in ethnoarchaeology, current art tradition of indigenous people is used as ethnographic tool for the procurement of rock art meanings. Moreover, there are societies in which rock art is still practised. Since rock art and indigenous societies are global phenomena, therefore, it is desirable to discuss the role of ethnography in the interpretation of rock art with global examples.

## **Living Rock Art Traditions**

## *The Case of Aborigines of Australia*

In Australia the tradition of rock art is still followed by the aboriginals. It is their living tradition which they have been practising since time immemorial. How magnificent it is to know about rock art of 10,000 or more years of art inscription practice, the sheer bulk of images, the numbers of generations of people involved and the potential influence of the older paintings on successive generations of people (Kleinert and Neale 2000).

The aboriginal people have their own history about their origin, land, etc. Their history is orally transmitted from one generation to another with 'great accuracy'. In spite of oral historical data, the aborigines preserve their history in rock art which is called 'dreamtime' (McKay 2001). This dreamtime is in the form of stories depicted in symbols which are interpreted only by the storytellers. Some of these stories contain sacred 'secret' knowledge about their origin which is held by carefully selected tribal custodians called the storytellers. These storytellers strictly maintain the originality of its content so that there is no 'cut' and 'edit' in the oral system. The undisrupted learning tradition of storytelling through rock art made the aboriginal people to understand much about their prehistory, culture and society (see McKay 2001; Kleinert and Neale 2000).

Thus, the interpretation of the rock art may get immense help from living rock art tradition of aboriginal which they have been practising since Pleistocene period between 2.5 million and 11,000 years ago (McKay 2001). The rock art has different purposes, and these purposes need to be understood rightly for the articulation of these rock arts. Scholars inform us that some rock arts are for serious purposes in which the aboriginals follow strict rules, while some are for child's fun (Kleinert and Neale 2000).

The symbols used by the present aboriginals are quite similar with the rock art symbols of early man discovered in many places of the world. Helen F. McKay (2001) elaborately discussed all these symbols. Table 12.1 lists the detailed descriptions of the symbols depicted in the rock art of aboriginal people.

Kleinert and Neale (2000) also have informed us of detailed description of various symbols of the aboriginal rock art (Table 12.2).

The aboriginal rock art at present in most cases quite resembles the rock art of early age, and there are similarities in designs and symbols. Thus, the ethnographic studies of the rock art of present aboriginals are very helpful for the interpretation of the rock art of the past. The observation of J.D. Lewis-Williams (1991) and Salamon Reinach (1903) (as mentioned in Lewis-Williams and Challis 1991) on the upper Palaeolithic art of Australia testifies the importance of ethnography in the interpretation of rock art. Cummings et al. (2014) maintain that Salamon Reinach (1903) drew on Australian ethnography to advocate totemism and related magical practices as motivation for the Franco-Cantabrian images.

In Australia 'dreamtime' and its variants signify everything that was or remains aboriginal (Wolfe 1991). Here dreamtime and its variants mean rock art, bark art and body paintings all governed by same sentiments, subjects, etc. The living rock art of aboriginals and the way they live in today's world resemble with prehistoric rock art. Obviously, living rock art could be of great help to draw meaning in context of early rock art.

## *The Case of San People of Southern Africa*

The San people, also known as Bushman and Xam, practise rock art that can stretch back to the prehistoric period. Southern Africa's earliest rock art is surprisingly old. In Apollo cave there are seven painted plaquettes which belong to Middle Stone Age level between 27,500 and 25,500 years ago (Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2004). There has been a long debate on San rock art among the archaeologists and anthropologists. Scholars and researchers have tried to interpret San rock art through San mythology, shamanism and spirituality. Whatever tools they might use to understand the San rock art, the point is very clear that ethnographic approach has been applied for its interpretation. Delving into the working of nonliterate culture of distant antiquity is a dicey business. It is dependent on our comprehension of how such cultures articulated their everyday needs and their comprehension of the world about them (Lewis-Williams and Pearce 2004). It means the ethnologists and their description are very important to find the answer of remote past through the studies of those folks who show similar kinds of cultural, social and ecological setups.

Some of the San rock arts are historical and connected with the San people; the subject, however, may vary from mythology and shamanic to depicting contact with the colonists and indigenous farmers (Solomon 1997). A few researchers of San rock art correlate San rock art with Shamanism (Dowson and Holliday 1989). The San rock art depicts animal and human figures, geometric designs, and figures related with events and daily life. All the depictions in San rock art are discussed in the light of San spirituality, myth, trance, shaman and rituals. Scholars who are studying San rock art have been trying to establish their own logic based on San ethnography (Lewis-Williams 2006; Dowson and Holliday 1989; Solomon 1997, 2006).

There are many rock art motifs which are interpreted by different scholars with special reference to San ethnography (Table 12.3).

**Table 12.3** Rock art in San ethnography

On a whole the San rock art painting can more clearly be interpreted through the recent sources of information in those areas of belief where exclusive relations between it and current southern epigraphy can be shown (Lewis-Williams 1983). Further many important features of the art depict some of the key metaphors which can be formulated and interpreted by San ideas about the cosmos and their place (Lewis-Williams 1983).

The importance of San (Xam) ethnography in interpretation of San rock art is clearly discussed by Solomon. We are given to understand that interpretation of San rock art has been heavily dependent on the various San ethnographies, particularly those of the Xam. These people inhabited Northern Cape Province, South Africa, until the twentieth century. What is important is that different readings of these ethnographies present different interpretations. For example, the interlinked theme of gender, sexuality and rain appeared to be as important in the art as shamanistic elements. On the other hand, interpretation centring on the trance dance, recorded ethnographically from recent and contemporary San groups, has been most productive by interlinking various aspects of Shan culture (see Solomon 1992).

## **Rock Art and Tribal Paintings of India**

India is a country with cultural diversity. In all her length and breadth, there is uniqueness which prevails in its culture. Due to modernity and globalization, the original life of the tribal people is changing; yet the tribes still show their commitment to their traditional way of life especially in their belief system, rituals, ceremonies and art forms. Painting is one of the tribal art forms which are being practised since time immemorial. Across India some tribes are known for their distinct art of paintings. These tribes are Gond, Baiga, Kanwars, Bhil, Bhilala (Madhya Pradesh), Saora (Odisha), Warli (Maharashtra), Rathwa and Naik (Gujarat), Muria, Kashgharua and Binjhwars from Chhattisgarh (Gupta 2008). Among the paintings of these tribes, some are so popular that the paintings are identified with the name of the respective tribes: Saora, Warli, Gond, Rathwa, Bhil and Muria.

With many similarities these tribal paintings are not alike but vary in some respects. It is however been seen that these tribal paintings are having sociocultural significance. Like other indigenous and rock art paintings, the Indian tribes paint their house walls or floors for specific purposes ranging from magic to belief system, celebration, rituals, ceremonies, auspicious occasions, cultural festivals, secular themes, thanksgiving, pacifying malevolent deities, etc.

Apart from many characteristic elements, the tribal paintings of India also show close affinity with rock art. The interpretation of rock art through tribal paintings can be executed in two ways. First, the tribal life and their culture are still carrying archaic elements within. The hunts, dances, etc. which are core subjects of the rock art paintings are also visible in the Indian tribal life (see Brooks and Wakankar 1976). In Jharkhand, hunting is treated as ceremonial act and is seasonally performed. *Phagu Sendra* (hunting in the month of March–April) and Bisu *Sendra*

(hunting in the month of October–November) (Minz 1996) are two such seasonal hunting traditions. Second, in all the four characteristic features of paintings, viz. thought (imagination), surface (canvass), tools and pigments (Gupta 2008), we see resemblance between the tribal paintings and rock art. One can see that the tribal paintings not only show similarity of subject matter with the rock art but are distantly related with articulation of motifs (Brooks and Wakankar 1976). The similarity in subjects and motifs indicate likeness of thoughts. The early man had used rock and cave wall and ceilings of their settlement area as a surface to paint. In the same way, tribes used to paint on inner and outer walls of the house. Even the tools of tribes are similar to those of earlier periods: hands (palm, fist and fingers), twig or animal hair (Gupta 2008). The colour composition in tribal paintings is not very complex, it is usually *mono* colour or at best *di*- or *tri*-colour. Same colour composition is also seen in rock art. Thus all the comparative study of both the art forms on the basis of four components of paintings reveals how close tribal paintings are to rock art paintings. Not only they are similar; they also suggest aspects of similarity of cultural traits.

The tribal paintings of India are specific and very close to prehistoric painting world for the following reasons:

- 1. The tribal paintings of India are inspired by their culture. In other words the tribal paintings are based on their respective culture. It is because of this reason one can see that all the tribal paintings are having collective expression rather than individual expression. In tribal paintings the artist is not free to express his/ her own thoughts. All the subjects of the paintings are exclusively designed by different aspects of their culture (secular, non-secular or both). More or less same subjects are also present in rock art through which one can see day to day life of early man. For example, in Warli painting, we can see various activities of their culture like *Tarpa dance*, *Dhol dance*, *Gauri dance*, *Kambdi dance*, shaman training, beating of evil spirit ritual, worship of goddess Kansari, *Muthi ritual*, hunting scenes, wedding ceremonies, agricultural ceremonies, etc. (see Tribhuwan and Finkenauer 2003). In fact their paintings are, as informed by Shah and Sen (1984), the totality of their life. In fact all the tribal paintings speak about their life ways.
- 2. The articulation is linear or one dimensional, plain, simple and made up of one colour, two colours and sometimes three colours. The tribes use silhouette patterns. All these styles resemble rock art. The silhouette pattern1 is immensely used in Gond, Bhil and Bhilala paintings, whereas Saora and Warli paintings are single-lined. In respect to use of colours, Saora and Warli paintings are monocoloured. Gond, Muria, Bhil and Bhilala paintings are monocoloured or di-coloured.

<sup>1</sup>Silhouette pattern is a very common pattern/style of painting in which the images not only have outlines but are filled with colour, or sometimes with geometric designs like zigzags, curve lines, straight vertical or horizontal lines, dots, etc.

The painting tradition has been in practice by the tribes since time immemorial. Historians believe that the Warli painting of Maharashtra can be traced back to as far as the Neolithic period between 2500 and 3000 BC (see Patel et al. 2014). Even in the tiny Gond village of Bhinyapur at the foot of Bhimbetka Mountain where the World Heritage rock art sites are located, the life of the villagers is not very different from that of the Neolithic time (see Brooks and Wakankar 1976).

## **Conclusion**

The study of rock art has travelled a long way and has widened its scope and applications. A human is a physical body carrier of many things within himself, viz. society, language, religion, culture, etc. Therefore, rock art is not only an account of the past; but it opens close doors of human history and chronological development of all things that have always been remained part of cultural development. Human growth in terms of his/her various materialistic and nonmaterialistic achievements has never showed uniformity; therefore, some communities are still showing archaic elements in their livings. These sections are settled around the world and are popularly known as indigenous people. Interestingly most of the indigenous people are practising living rock art/painting tradition. Some of these living painting traditions can stretch up to Neolithic period or may be further back. Thus rock art of early time is only a segment of present painting tradition of indigenous people. Rock art is not dead with the death of early human; but it continued with living painting tradition of indigenous people.

Human behaviour cannot be studied within a fixed boundary. Thus, it is very important to take aid from the painting tradition of indigenous people to conduct an in-depth research in rock art to reconstruct the past culture which other disciplines lack due to their focus on the present. Moreover, history in itself does not have the permission of its defined boundary to transgress it to study prehistoric unwritten life of people. Encompassing the ethnographic methods in the research of rock art not only may give better results in the interpretation of rock art but may help in reconstructing the past life of many tribal communities.
