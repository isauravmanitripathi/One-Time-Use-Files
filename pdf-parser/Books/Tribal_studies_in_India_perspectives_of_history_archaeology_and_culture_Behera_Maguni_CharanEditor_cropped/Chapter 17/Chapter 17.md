**Abstract** Ecological factor plays a significant role in the process of interaction between tribes and non-tribes. This premise forms the essence of discussion in this chapter. Andaman Islanders are eco-system people who encountered encroachment of their resources during colonial rule and subsequently by settlers in Independent India. The chapter highlights how colonial rule and settlers reduced the tribes from resource owners to resource refugees, for they have been depending upon the dole provided by the administration after their contact. Precisely, the paper applies ecological perspective to study the history of tribal resistance in Andaman Islands during colonial interventions, and the process of integration through confrontation and conciliation after India's Independence.

## **Introduction**

For centuries, many of the human groups living in the environment of the dense/ deep forests, mountain interiors, deserts and isolated islands remained unknown, fully or partially, to the rest of the world. With the passage of time, contacts could be established with many of them. Whether it is isolation or contact of a human group with other, it has its own advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantages are more if a human group happens to be small in size and its members practise hunting-gathering mode of subsistence activities with simple tools and technology; they are vulnerable to the situation of being pushed out of their resources as well as

livelihood. Smaller the size of population of the group, the greater the risk of exclusion that looms from resources and livelihood options. Therefore, indigenous small populations appear extremely vulnerable in the event of direct or indirect threat from various external forces, particularly encroachment of their territory by others, invasion of modern culture, etc., as an aftermath of the contacts. Such examples are not rare where vibrant human populations, consequent upon intervention of forces of modern culture, including spread of communication network and market mechanism, were altogether obliterated, eliminated or assimilated. For example, the Tasmanian aborigines, who once dwelt the island with mighty strides, could not withstand the pressure let loose by the expansion of European empires on their land (Danda 1993). Several among the tribes of Australia, America and Canada failed to adjust to the emerging situation in the event of the arrival of waves of the white immigrants to their territories and in the process were ultimately eliminated. The examples of the Great Andamanese and the Onge of the Andaman Islands make almost close parallels in this respect. Though they have not been eliminated, their population has decreased alarmingly. The Jarawa who have recently become friendly with the outsiders also run the risk of meeting the same fate if appropriate measures are not initiated to protect them (Fig. 17.1).

## **Andaman Islands**

Floating in splendid isolation, east of the Indian mainland, the Andaman and Nicobar groups of islands are situated between 6° and 14° north latitudes and between 93° and 94° east longitudes in the Bay of Bengal with Ten Degree Channel separating the Andaman group of islands from that of the Nicobar. Wet tropical regime with predominance of monsoon rainfall has resulted in the luxuriant growth of tropical rain forests (Lal 1976: 51). Andaman Islands are home to four Negrito groups, namely, the Great Andamanese, the Onges, the Jarawa and the Sentinelese (Cipriani 1966). Andaman Islands remained shrouded in the mystery till the British occupied these islands in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Though the Andaman Islands found place in the accounts of sailors, travellers and traders since long, the central theme in almost all these references was the cruel nature and the demonic appearance of the cannibal inhabitants of the Islands (Mathur 1968: 7; Portman 1990: 51). An authentic account of the Andaman Islands is available since the period British took control of these islands. Colonization of the Andaman Islands had its impact on the native population of these islands which has been discussed with reference to important historic events/accidents/decisions, etc.

## **The Colonial Period (1789–1947)**

During the colonial period, a number of events took place that shaped the history of the Islands and brought a great variety of changes in the human population and cultural fabric of the Andaman Islands. It covers a long period spanning over almost 160 years with short lulls. For example, between 1796 and 1858, there was a gap of approximately half a century, i.e. time gap between the first and second penal settlement, when there were no contacts. Contacts during the colonial period can be divided into two distinct phases, i.e. first penal settlement and second penal settlement, each representing its own period, nature of contacts and types of happenings.

**The First Penal Settlement** was established by the British in September 1789 in Andaman Islands. A documented account of contact with Negrito populations of the Andaman Islands is available only since first penal settlement (Majumdar 1975: 52). The British, however, had to vacate the Islands in May 1796 on many counts, most important was that they were prone to tropical diseases, particularly malaria.

**The Second Penal Settlement** in the Andaman Islands was established in March 1858 after the acceptance of 'the Report of a Committee'.1 By establishing a penal settlement in the Andaman Islands, the British Government were faced with two urgent problems that required immediate attention. The first was the general policy to be adopted towards the aborigines, and second was the creation of a suitable machinery of administration for the Islands. Considering the aborigines as primitive and cruel, the Court of Directors directed British officials to take all possible precautions to protect the aboriginal inhabitants of the Andaman Islands from the collision with convicts (Mathur 1968: 69). However the British failed to adhere to the said policy. In the following discussion, the history of contacts and their impacts on Negrito groups have been elucidated.

## **The Great Andamanese**

The Great Andamanese, one of the four Negrito tribes of the Islands, originally had ten subgroups and were distributed from south to north in the Andaman Islands. The present-day Great Andamanese include members of three groups, namely, the Aka-Chari, Aka-Jeru and the Aka-Bea-da. Besides these three, they had other seven

<sup>1</sup>See Murthy (2009). In January 1858, a commission known as Andaman Commission, headed by F.J Mouat, was sent to examine the islands for a possible site for a penal settlement. In his exhaustive and practical report, Mouat proposed Blair's original settlement of 1790, known as the Old Harbour as the most appropriate place for establishing the new settlement and further suggested that it be named as Port Blair in his honour. In March 1858, J.P Walker, an experienced jail superintendent known for the severity of his discipline, arrived at the Andamans with four European officials and 200 convicts, cleared Chatham and Ross Islands and established the 38 settlement.

groups, viz. the Aka-Kora, Aka-Bo, Aka-Kede, Aka-Kol, Okka-Juwai, Aka-Puikwar and the Aka-Bele. Each group had occupied a certain area of the island.

Leaving aside the Aka-Bea, the average extent of territory occupied by a tribe was about 264 km2 . Of the ten groups, the largest in terms of area occupied was probably the Aka-Kede, having over 300 km2 of territory, while the smallest was probably the Aka-Chari having a territory less than 160 km2 (Radcliffe-Brown 1922: 25). Within their own territory, these small subgroups were nomadic in order to make the best use of natural resources available there. The relationships among these groups were not friendly. On the contrary, there existed tribal warfare among these different groups.

As expected, skirmishes of different types started taking place immediately after the establishment of the penal settlement. As punitive measures, several expeditions were sent to teach a lesson to the autochthones. The Government communication admitted that the settlement officials preferred to ignore the path of conciliation and selected to play the role of assailants (Portman 1990: 271–73).

The cruel and vindictive policy of the British officials posted in the area generated a definite spirit of hostility among the aborigines against the British and a grim determination to drive them out from their habitat. It found expression in a series of attacks by them in quick succession during the months of April and May 1859. But the bow and arrows were no answer to the firearms of the British. The first organized attack by the Great Andamanese was made on 6th of April, 1859. It was followed by another attack on 14th of April, 1859, in which about 1500 aborigines participated (Majumdar 1975: 82–83). It was a revelation to the whole spectrum of contacts of the aborigines with the British and the latter's relation with and attitude towards the aborigines. In the said attack, the Great Andamanese vented their wrath on gang men but were quite friendly with convicts who had iron ring round the ankle as distinctive marks. According to Portman, the Great Andamanese told him that they objected to the clearing of the forests. Important among them was conflict of 17th of May, 1859, also known as the 'Battle of Aberdeen'. In this skirmish, many Great Andamanese were killed (Majumdar 1975: 82–83). Portman (1990: 279 and 288) writes:

Far from being a ludicrous skirmish, it was the most desperate and determined attack by the aborigines ever made on the settlement. The policy of Mr. Walker must be held responsible for these unfortunate episodes.

In 1863, E. H. Man established 'Andaman Home' at Port-Blair. Rev. Corbyn, a priest, was entrusted with the task of civilizing the Great Andamanese. 'Here they were provided free rations, lodgings and medical attendance' (Radcliffe-Brown 1922: 10). Nevertheless, Portman report, 1899 (see Portman 1990), reveals that yearning of the Great Andamanese to go back and to live the traditional way of life in the forests always remained strong among them. In the later years, the situation gradually improved, and by the end of the 1860s, almost all the subgroups of the Great Andamanese had been slowly and gradually tamed following the policy of carrot and stick. The Aka-Bea-da was the first to be completely befriended followed by other groups of the Great Andamanese. But an obvious fallout of the contact situation was the sudden decline in their population from a strong 3500 in 1858 to 50 in

a It is the combined population of the Great Andamanese group from Sl. No. 1 to 10

1951 and 19 in 1961 (Table 17.1). In the post-Independence period, they were living in dilapidated condition in and around Port-Blair. Finally, the Andaman and Nicobar Administration settled them at Strait Island in 1974 (Chakraborty 1990). A few years back, their population was recorded 49 (AAJVS 2010). Now they are no longer full-time hunter-gatherers. Presently, few of them are working in different departments of Andaman and Nicobar Administration also.

## **The Onges**

The Onges are another Negrito tribe who inhabit the Little Andaman (see Basu 1990 for details). Like other Negritoes, they also resented any intrusion in their territory. They put up resistance within the limitation of their weaponry based on simple tools, technology and their physical strength, which lasted for several years. The goodwill efforts of the M.V. Portman, Officer-in-Charge of relations with the aborigines from 1879 to 1900, bore fruits in 1886 when he succeeded in establishing friendly contacts with the Onges. Within a span of 20 years since their friendly contact with outsiders in 1886, the Onges had completely been befriended (Sarkar 1993: 171). This change in their outlook from hostility to friendliness towards outsiders proved a turning point because thereafter they never picked up bows and arrows to defend them and their territory. The British did not colonize the island of Little Andaman as they had done in the South, Middle and North Andaman Islands; nor were the Onges put in any kind of 'Homes' for civilizing them. In the post-Independence period, Little Andaman was opened for the rehabilitation of the refugees in 1967 (Pandit and Chattopadhyay 1993: 171). It dealt a major blow to the

Onges as it not only reduced the size of their territory but also curtailed their resource base. To compensate the loss of space (niche) and resources, they were settled in 1974 at two places in the Little Andaman, namely, South Bay and Dugong Creek. Today they are no longer solely dependent on hunting, fishing and gathering. At the new place of settlements, the Andaman Administration regularly provides them the articles of daily use including food items. Like the Great Andamanese group, the Onge population has also declined from 700 in 1858 to 150 in 1951 and 97 in 2002 (Tables 17.1 and 17.2). In the year 2005, the total population of the Onges was only 97 (Kumar and Haider 2007: 128).

## **The Sentinelese**

The Negrito hunter-gatherers of the North Sentinel Island are known as the Sentinelese (see Pandit 1990 for details). They have been described as the world's most isolated population and hence the least known. As such, there has been a mystique about their lifestyle, culture and society. The British in the absence of any urgent need for land and forest resources of this small island (area 50 km2 ) off the west coast of South Andaman did not make any efforts to befriend them. Only few visits were made from 1867 onwards by the British, but no close contact was made. In the post-Independence period from 1967 onwards, occasional expeditions were sent to the North Sentinel Island, but no significant changes in the attitude of the Sentinelese were noticed. The situation improved with time, and a breakthrough was achieved in February 1991 when the Sentinelese accepted the gifts from the hands of the members of the contact team who were awaiting ashore (Pandit and Chattopadhyay 1993: 176). Despite the initial success, there still exists an ambience of hostility between the Sentinelese and the outsiders. The occasional expeditions are still being sent by the local administration into their area for establishing friendly contacts with them, but of no avail. Presently, the Andaman and Nicobar Administration is following the policy of noninterference with respect to the Sentinelese.

## **The Jarawa**

While all ten groups of the Great Andamanese and the Onge tribe had come under the influence of the British within the few years of the establishment of the second penal settlement at Port-Blair in 1858, the Jarawa, however, did not accept the friendly overture of the British. The Jarawa suffered violence because of the punitive expeditions sent by the British administration against them for their disinclination to be friendly with the new settlers and their unwillingness to submit to new arrangements. The Jarawa continued with their defensive posture until the second half of 1997, and then they became friendly with the non-Jarawa (Anthropological Survey of India, 2002: 45; also see Sarkar 1987). The history of the contacts of the Jarawa with non-Jarawa has been discussed in three broad time periods: (i) contacts during 1858 to 1900; (ii) contacts during 1901–1939; and (iii) contacts during the Japanese occupation between 1942 and 1945. The details of the contacts during the aforementioned time periods have been discussed below.

#### (a) *Contacts during 1858–1900*

As mentioned earlier, during the first phase of the penal settlement, the Jarawa behaved in a nonchalant manner with the colonizers in contrast to the Aka-Bea-da of Great Andaman tribes. During the initial years of the second penal settlement, the Jarawa remained inoffensive. The British learnt about the hostility of the Jarawa around 1863 when Topsy, the Great Andamanese girl staying at the 'Andaman Home', told the Reverend H. Corbyn, in charge of the 'Home', that there were tribes in the south like the Jarawa who were hostile not only to the Andamanese but also to the British and warned him not to proceed to their settlement (Majumdar 1975: 87). But he failed to understand the reasons behind their hostility (Portman 1990: 716). The Jarawa attacked the settlement for the first time in the year 1872. However, the situation took a turn for worse in the following years and hostility with Jarawa scaled up, and hardly a year passed without violent skirmishes between the Jarawa and the non-Jarawa (Census of India 1931: 14). To add fuel to the fire, the Great Andamanese were used to catch and befriend the Jarawa ignoring the fact that the Great Andamanese, particularly the Aka-Bea-da, were traditionally at enmity with the Jarawa. Even this method did not bear fruit.

By sending armed personnel into their territories, people with friendly disposition were pushed to abject hatred. By the end of the nineteenth century, the situation had further worsened.

#### (b) *Contacts during 1901–1939*

After the retirement of Mr. Portman in 1900, the conciliatory policy that was followed till 1900 for the Jarawa was abandoned. As a result, the hostility on both sides aggravated. At this time the Jarawas were even resisting with all their might the establishment of any settlements in their territory. In turn, the settlers and British authority were attacking the Jarawa frequently. The turnaround from a policy of protecting the tribes from collision with the settlers and thus saving the indigenous people from extermination was complete when in 1905 a 'Bush Police Force' was formed with friendly Great Andamanese as members and Burmese Jamadar in charge of it. The job of the Bush Police Force was to hunt the Jarawa and the runaway convicts too (Mathur 1968: 114–15). In one such expedition by Captain West in 1925, as many as 37 Jarawas were claimed to have been shot dead (Census of India 1931: 16). With each passing year, number of punitive expeditions sent inside the Jarawa territory increased. Consequently, the feeling of hostility in the Jarawa against the outsiders was further fuelled.

#### (c) *Contacts during the Japanese occupation (1942–1945)*

The Andaman and Nicobar Islands were under Japanese occupation from March 1942 to October 1945. The Japanese were interested to fortify the entire coast, but the Jarawa made their work difficult on the west coast of the Andaman. Consequently, the Jarawa areas were reported to have been machine gunned from air because two Japanese soldiers had allegedly been killed at the hands of the Jarawa (Sarkar 1993: 104). Though nothing is known about the causalities the Jarawa suffered in that attack, it did enhance their hatred towards the outsiders.

## **The Post-Independence Period**

After the Independence, under the new policy of the Indian Government, the legacy of large-scale and organized state violence and policy of punitive expedition towards the Jarawa was entirely given up. The Jarawas were declared a 'Scheduled Tribe' along with other five tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Their territory was declared a reserved territory under the Government of India Forest Act and the Tribal Regulation of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Further, in order to befriend the Jarawa, intermittent gift-giving operations were started.

In mid 1968, three Jarawa men were caught by the villagers of the Kadamtala in Middle Andaman when they had come to pick up some metal implements from the village. They were taken to the Port-Blair and kept for a month and then sent back to Kadamtala for release. After this incidence, the activity of gift-dropping operation in the Jarawa area was increased and systematized. On the 18th of February 1974, a gift-dropping party, under the supervision of Shiv Prasad Singh, Head Constable, Bush Police, was accosted by a group of Jarawa without their weapons and with friendly gesture. This was followed by vigorous efforts to renew contact with the Jarawa in the area. On the 5th and 10th of April 1974, Mr. Bakhtawar Singh, Officer-in-Charge, Bush Police, and other members of the contact team were able to meet the Jarawa at Lakra Lungta on the west coast of the Middle Andaman (Pandit and Chattopadhyay 1993: 173). Between 1974 and 1996, scores of visits were paid to the Jarawa area (Sarkar 1990).

The contact missions did succeed in creating some positive impact on the Jarawa. However, the nascent friendship and amity were interrupted time and again by continuing conflicts with the settlers (Mukhopadhyay 2002: 24–29). In April 1996, an

interesting incident happened. A Jarawa named Enmei with a broken leg was captured and admitted to the Primary Health Centre at Kadamtala and then referred to G.B. Pant Hospital, Port-Blair, where he received treatment for about 6 months. Following this incident, the contact situation took a decisive turn. After being released from the hospital, Enmei was sent back to Kadamtala from where he was released in the Jarawa territory. Unexpectedly, few months later, one day in October 1997, a group of unarmed Jarawa appeared at Uttara Jetty, Middle Andaman. This event was a watershed in the history of relationship of the Jarawa with the non-Jarawa as it marked the end to the phase of hostility and beginning of friendly relations between the Jarawa and the non-Jarawa. It was a welcome change as hardly any incident of conflict between the Jarawa and the villagers was reported thereafter (Kumar and Biswas 2002: 58–7; also see Mukhopadhyay et al. 2002).

## **Impact of Contacts**

Every contact, whether friendly or hostile between two human groups, has its own impact on both the groups, and the contacts have their own origin, nature and development. In the background of the above-mentioned contacts, it would be worthwhile to see the impact of contact on the Negrito groups and their habitat. Impact of contact has been seen through two time periods determined by important historical events.

## *Impact During the British Period (1858–1947)*

Major impact of contact during the British period was in the form of territorial displacement and redefining of boundaries. Both the social and geographical boundaries amongst the Andaman Islanders have evolved through many factors such as language, customary law, spatial organization and access to resources. Such variables are applicable to most societies in the world. The tribes of the Andaman Islands largely distinguished themselves by their own territory and dialect. Maintenance of exclusive territories by these groups gave them the benefits of extraction of resources from specific areas and social cohesiveness of small groups and at the same time created a situation of diversity of cultures. Previous studies on Andamanese culture and social organization described the Andamanese tribes based on their spatial organization as people were divided in groups. The area used and occupied by a particular Andamanese group was delineated by specific names pertaining to and corroborative of both natural features and accounts that were associated with the area (Man 1975: 30–40).

For a long time in the past, different Negrito groups of the Andaman Islands were hostile to each other, and their territories were well demarcated and protected. During the year 1889, the North Andaman was inhabited predominantly by four major tribes, i.e. the Aka-Chari occupying the coastal areas of the North Andaman and the AkaKora living mostly in the interior of the North Andaman, while the Aka-Bo and Aka-Jeru inhabited the central and southern part of the island, respectively. By 1901, there was remarkable shrinkage of the Aka-Jeru territory and conspicuous spread of the territory of the coastal Aka-Chari. It means the coastal tribe dominated their counterpart in the tribal warfare. By 1961 there was a complete disappearance of the Aka-Kora and Aka-Bo from the North Andaman (Mathur 1968: 105).

In the Middle Andaman, during the year 1889, there were four main tribal groups. These were the Aka-Kede occupying more than half of Middle Andaman. While the Aka-Kol were settled along the south-east coast, the Okka-Juwai occupied the south-western interior and the Aka-Puikwar the southern coastal area of the Middle Andaman. By 1901, the Aka-Kede had pushed their territory southward by dominating over the other tribes. Consequently, the Aka-Kol were pushed further south and south-west dominating over the other two tribes, i.e. the Aka-Puikwar and the Okka-Juwai. Later on, all suffered the same fate as those of the North Andaman groups and in the process completely vanished, and sometime around 1930 the area came under the control of the Jarawa.

Further south, the Baratang Island and a part of South Andaman were inhabited by the Aka-Puikwar tribe during the year 1889. In 1901, the Jarawa from south invaded their territory and pushed them out of South Andaman and occupied a part of the Baratang Island also. In the following decades, the whole of the Aka-Puikwar had vanished. Later, the British pushed the Jarawa out of the Baratang Island (Mathur 1968: 123).

The South Andaman Island and Rutland Island were inhabited by three major tribes in 1889. The Aka-Bea-da had occupied the major areas of South Andaman; the Jarawa were in the interior and the Aka-Puikwar in small territory along the north-eastern coast. The Aka-Bele tribe inhabited the Richie archipelago. Table 17.1 shows a progressive decline of all these tribes except the Jarawa in 1901 that had moved themselves from south to north. By the 1930s, the Jarawa had established themselves over major parts of the South and Middle Andaman Islands.

By 1951, most of the tribal groups of the Great Andamanese had vanished. Of the ten groups of the Great Andamanese, only three were surviving and had a total population of 19 only in 1961. They were, namely, the Aka-Chari, Aka-Jeru and the Aka-Bea-da, who had no control over their formal territory. Having been reduced in number and without any territory of their own, they were living in miserable condition in and around Port-Blair. Finally, they were settled at Strait Island in 1970 (Sarkar 1993: 7).

By 1951, the Jarawa had completely vacated Richie Island and were occupying the western part of the South and Middle Andaman as these islands were vacant. The situation remained the same in the following decades. Onges, who were once the sole inhabitants of the Little Andaman, were settled in 1974 at two places, namely, Dugong Creek and South Bay, and since then the situation has remained more or less the same. The Little Andaman also witnessed rehabilitation of refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan (Kumar 2002: 131). The Sentinelese are the only human group whose territory and most probably the population have remained more or less intact owing to the absence of any contact of the non-Sentinelese with them.

As discussed earlier, because of the growing hostility with the Jarawa, the British Government established Bush Police Force in 1905 to contain the Jarawa and to protect the settlers and convicts. As such, several outposts of the Bush Police Force were established on the periphery of the Jarawa territory. Many of these outposts continued to exist even in the post-Independence period. After 1997, when the Jarawa became friendly with the non-Jarawa, the name of the Bush Police Force was changed, and now it is known as the Jarawa Protection Force. Only few outposts of the Jarawa Protection Force exist at present.

## *Impact During the Post-Independence Period*

The independence of India ushered in a new era for all the tribal groups of the country including the Negrito groups of the Andaman Islands. Initiation of a number of developmental activities, the rehabilitation of the refugees from the erstwhile East Bengal after the formation of Bangladesh, redefining of the territory, etc. were crucial events that had telling impact on the Jarawa and the Onges.

## **Refugee Rehabilitation**

In the post-Independence period, the Middle, South and Little Andaman were opened up for rehabilitation of the refugees from Bangladesh. Rehabilitation of refugees in Little Andaman had its beginning in 1969 and it continued till 1979. As part of the colonization scheme of different islands, Tamil repatriates from Sri Lanka and Burma, and the Nicobarese from Car Nicobar were settled between 1973 and 1979. Some families of the Mopalah community from the South Andaman Islands were settled in the Little Andaman (Chakraborty and Dinda 2002).

In South and Middle Andaman Islands between 1949 and 1959, altogether 68 villages of the refugees consisting of 2328 families having a total population of 10,018 persons were established. It was an open case of invasion of the Jarawa territory. In different parts of the South, Middle and North Andaman Islands, some lands were identified, and a programme for acquiring the land was made. It was also estimated that approximately 5000 refugee families could be settled in those areas (Sen 1962: 92). Each of the rehabilitated family was given an ex gratia grant of Rs. 1050, a recoverable loan of Rs. 1730 and a total of 10 acres of land, of which five acres each for paddy land and hilly land (Sen 1962: 103–104). In addition to this land, each family was given 5 acres of land as homestead and for other uses.

During a span of 7 years from 1949 to 1955, altogether 931 families were rehabilitated in various villages of South Andaman like Homfregunj, Herbertabad, Guptapara, Wimberlygunj and Shoal Bay. Similar process of encroachment on the Jarawa territory was repeated in the Middle Andaman during the second phase of rehabilitation. In the Middle Andaman alone, between 1953 and 1956 as many as 1300 families were rehabilitated. The peak years of the rehabilitation activities were 1954 and 1956. Within a period of 7 years, about 1397 families were rehabilitated in six batches in different parts of the Rangat Valley, stretching from Betapur to Uttara. Here, each family was provided with Rs. 2000/- as loan in addition to the usual allotment of 10 acres of land. This area has certain special features like good soil, abundant rain and perennial sources of fresh water, which attracted more settlers (Sen 1962). As a result, population in this part of the Island registered phenomenal growth.

## **Reduction of Territory**

The historical events in the Indian subcontinent following the termination of colonization led to the opening up of the Andaman Islands for the rehabilitation and resettlement of refugee population. It has the far-reaching consequences for the surviving Negrito populations of the Andaman Islands, particularly the Jarawa and the Onges, as their territories were chosen by the Government for the rehabilitation.

In the case of Little Andaman, the home of the Onges, all these activities took place along the eastern coast and consequently many *beyras*, community hut of the Onges, were uprooted. The present land use pattern in the Little Andaman shows that out of a total of 77,699.37 ha of land available, 3435.96 ha is under revenue; 1768.7 ha under plantation; 47,295.34 ha under forest; and 25,200 ha under tribal reserve. On analysis of land use pattern, one finds that there is two-third reduction in the territory of the Onge. Presently, the Onges have only 25,200 hectares under them. Though officially the Onges have not been prohibited from entering and using the resources of the reserved forest, regular extraction of timber by the Forest Department has greatly thinned the resources of the reserved forest. Only in year 2000, due to court case, extraction activities from the reserved forest have come to a halt (DoEF 2002). Besides, forestland adjacent to villages have been encroached upon for agricultural and settlement purposes. The recent study shows that the settled population for resource extraction regularly visits the forest areas falling in the radius of about 10 km. Thus, roughly 40 percent of the entire territory is out of reach of the Onges. Though the Little Andaman was the abode of the Onges, their functional resource region encompassed the North and South Brother islands, Cinque Island and Rutland. They used to visit these islands for honey, turtle, turtle eggs and wild boar. Since the late 1970s, the Onges have stopped visiting them as these islands are more visited by outsiders (Kumar 2002: 25–137).

Situation was not different in South and Middle Andaman. At the time of Independence of India, the Jarawa territory extended over northern part of the South Andaman and the entire Middle Andaman Islands with a total area of approximately 2950 sq. km. Besides, the forest areas of Baratang Island were also well within the functional resource region of the Jarawa. However, in the post-Independence period, the opening of the Islands for resettlement and rehabilitation of the refugee population and modifications in boundary of the Jarawa territory in subsequent Gazette notifications (Mukhopadhyay 2002: 40–41) resulted in huge reduction of the Jarawa

territory, particularly the area east of the Andaman trunk road, from 2950–765 km2 . This shrinkage entailed loss of the life-sustaining resource base of the Jarawa. Besides, in those notifications, the Jarawa reserve was defined only on the paper, but no attempt was made to delimit and demarcate it on the ground. As a result it always remained something vague on the ground. In addition, there was no buffer area between the Jarawa reserve and the settlement areas of the non-Jarawa. Subsequently, it resulted in illegal extraction of resources and encroachment in the Jarawa reserve (Mukhopadhyay 2002: 35–41).

In the initial 2 years after the Independence of India, the situation remained more or less the same. Soon the events that followed the Independence made substantial impact on the Jarawa people and their territory. Important among these events was opening of the Islands for the rehabilitation of the refugees from the erstwhile East Bengal (now Bangladesh).

The unfortunate part of the rehabilitation plan in South and Middle Andaman was that the refugees were settled near sources of fresh water, which effectively barred access of the Jarawa to this vital resource. The intrusion in their habitat and resultant loss of territory and life-sustaining resources because of establishment of refugee settlements had made the Jarawa more and more hostile towards the non-Jarawa. Therefore, the Jarawa resisted rehabilitation, and there were 76 encounters with them (Census of India 1961).

## **Competition for Resources**

Prior to settlement of the refugee population, the Onge and the Jarawa were the sole inhabitants and extractors of the natural resources, both terrestrial and aquatic. After the rehabilitation of the refugees, the scenario changed, and the situation increasingly aggravated in the successive decades. The situation can be understood from the following impacts:

- (a) There is absolute reduction in the total quantity of resources available in the forest due to formal and functional reduction in territory.
- (b) In present time more people are competing for the same resources.
- (c) The Onges and the Jarawas are competing with outsiders (mainly refugee population), who have better technology for exploiting resources and that too in less time.
- (d) The clandestine accumulative pursuit of the economic man (outsider) as against the non-accumulative pursuit of the satisfier, the Onge and the Jarawa, has heavily told on the resource regeneration capacity.

Owing to the aforementioned factors, the resource density of the region has thinned to the extent where it is proving detrimental to the foraging lifestyle of the Onge and the Jarawa (Kumar 2015: 233–256).

## **Illegal Extraction of Resources from the Tribal Territory**

As discussed earlier, the Andaman Islands were opened for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the refugees from the erstwhile East Pakistan between 1949 and 1969. In the initial days of rehabilitation, the settlers were primarily involved in agricultural activities. In addition, some of them also worked as agricultural labourers as a secondary source of income. A few of them worked as wage labourers in the Forest Department. Those immigrants who reached the Andaman Islands on their own and were not allotted any land by the authorities started carpentry work with wood and cane, in addition to working as wage labourers in various works.

With increase in population over decades, the tendency to exploit both forests and aquatic resources increased. The population of the non-tribal population in these islands increased manyfolds. It has its impact on the forest and sea resource of these islands. 'The Jarawa Report' of Anthropological Survey of India (An.S.I. 2002) also mentions of illegal fishing, hunting and extraction of timber and nontimber forest products from the Jarawa area.

## **Conclusion**

The colonization of the Indian continent proved fatal for the autochthones of the Andaman Islands. Of the ten subgroups of the Great Andamanese, only three were surviving at the end of the colonial rule, namely, Aka-Chari, Aka-Jeru and the Aka-Bea-da. They have not only been reduced in number but have also lost their territory. The Onges and the Jarawas too felt the burnt of punitive action carried out by colonial regime. While the population of the Onges had plummeted from 600 to 93 at the end of the colonial regime, the Jarawa population remained somewhat stable. Thus the colonial rule had debilitating impact on both the number and territory of the foraging population of the islands, particularly the Great Andamanese and the Onges.

The situation did not improve much in the post-Independence period. The biggest impact was on their territory. In Little Andaman, which happened to be the home of the Onges, only about one-third of the total territory was kept as tribal reserve. Similarly, in South and Middle Andaman too, about half of the total territory was denotified. To make the matter worse, the islands were opened for the refugee rehabilitation. The unfortunate part of the whole rehabilitation plan was that the villages were established at the outskirt of their truncated territory. In the following decades, the settlers were competing with the tribal groups for both aquatic and terrestrial resources found in the areas of the latter. Consequently, it had baneful impact on the resource density. Since the Onges were friendly with the settlers, the illegal extraction of the resources from their territory told heavily on the resource density. Subsequently, the Onges were left with no other options but to depend on

the dole given by the Andaman Administration. In case of the Jarawas, the relation of hostility on their part acted as shield till 1997. However, in the post 1997 period, the situation is slowly but steadily moving in a direction where the settlers are stealthily exploiting the resources of Jarawa reserve. If the current trend continues unchecked, the Jarawa too will meet the fate of the Onges.
