**Abstract** This chapter introduces to the growing scope of the discipline of archaeology in terms of the emergence of ethnoarchaeology as one of the growing sub-discipline; and aims at developing better explanatory models of past human culture through engagement with living societies; recording observable behaviour and consequent residues. It conceptualizes theoretical paradigm of ethnoarchaeology as it rests on the construct of ethnographic analogy and the principles of uniformitarianism; with a premise that living 'premodern' indigenous population acts as proxies for the people in the past and are deemed appropriate to be compared with archaeological contexts; and thereby forms important sources of interpretative information for the archaeologists. In view of this; the chapter is designed to throw light on the significances of pursuing such an endeavour on the indigenous tribal populations; particularly of Manipur and their counterparts of other northeastern India in general; as one of the immediate agenda of prehistoric archaeologists well before the life ways of these people are totally corrupted owing to the extraneous influence; such as globalization and the like.

## **Introduction**

An academic concern of archaeology is to increase knowledge of early human history with main attention on lithic remains considering them to be the key element to improve our understanding of the oldest phase of archaeology, the prehistory. Structuring prehistory reflects a peculiar position within the domain of human science since it involves hunting and unearthing the remains of the past, their proper analysis and giving their meaning. And this is a challenging venture on the part of the

prehistoric archaeologists who are to go without any written documents to refer, check or compare with. Prehistoric record, as a sample of past hominid activities, produces an incomplete but tangible repository of prehistoric behaviour. These records, comprising mainly artefacts, help us provide answer to the questions about the past. That the archaeological study basically centred on these durable lithic artefacts is an agreed fact as these represent the most tangible and commonly occurred solid and fossilized product of early human behaviour. These form the products of skilled craftsmanship and not simply the fragments of stone. One would hardly disagree with the notion that cultural reconstructions of past people have categorically sailed through the study of artefacts, the material leftover of the prehistoric human activities. Stone artefacts were initially studied primarily as indicators of cultural achievements and then of technology and subsistence strategies. And our understanding of information inferred from stone tools has extended even up to the level of conceptual thinking, the symbolic representation of the gradual development of intelligence of the maker which led to the development of cognitive archaeology (see Davidson and Nowell 2010).

Discussions on the archaeological data, the artefacts, are generally made with two basic propositions in the domain of archaeological grammar. The first proposition states that archaeological data, being formerly an integral part of sociocultural entities, 'cannot be adequately studied as artificially discrete subsystem separated from the whole circuitry of interaction which was its former context ... (and) should be studied in a socio-cultural and environmental context' (Clarke 1968: 479). The second argument is that archaeological data, being now detached from their systemic context, may 'best be studied empirically as a material phenomenon with observable regularities ... in terms of their own attribute systems, away from the distortions of loose presuppositions about their former contexts' (Clarke 1968: 479). Both propositions have merits in their own philosophy. But there may also be an argument that what is the detrimental to refer to both the domains in dealing with the finds. The issue deems essential in dealing with both empirically observed characters of the finds in terms of their typo-technology attributes and also the unseen side of the behaviours and actions (if possible) that were associated with the material objects during their living contexts. This obviously may refer to Schiffer's (1972) *archaeological* (dead) and *systemic* (living) contexts of the objects.

To an archaeologist, studying the past dynamic living contexts of the artefacts is much more stringent than studying definite characters of the finds in their static archaeological contexts. But in order to reconstruct their past mundane domain, archaeologists have no way out but to deal with these silent objects, who cannot speak. Obviously, they make no sense by themselves but only acquire significance when interpreted (Gamble 2001: 45). In dealing with these challenges, conventional archaeological practices alone are insufficient; and archaeologists seek for such a reconstruction through ethnography. It is maintained that since archaeologists have 'no direct access to information about human behaviour' (Trigger 1989: 357), ethnographic information can be employed in interpreting archaeological data with the use of analogy (Spaulding 1973; Stanislawski 1978; Stiles 1977; Gould 1980 and many others). It is essential to devise ways of inferring the dynamic nonmaterial

aspects of 'lived' culture and society from the static surviving physical remains that eventually come to form the 'dead' archaeological record (see Binford 1978). Here lies the meeting point of ethnography and archaeology, giving rise to the development of an academic endeavour within archaeology called 'ethnoarchaeology'. While describing the relationship of archaeology and ethnography, Kluckhohn (1940: 46) states that 'archaeology is the ethnography and culture history of past peoples and its cornerstone is analogy, (*and*) ... every archaeological reconstruction is analogy based upon a number of ... presumptions and assumptions'. Obviously development of ethnoarchaeology is also guided by a research theme – '*there is continuity of past identity in the present living context*'. Kofi Agorsah thus observed that 'Ethnoarchaeology … consist of a means of explaining the behaviour of past societies on the basis of analytical models derived from observed behavioural or cultural phenomena of living societies, traditional or not' (Agorsah 1999: 38).

Miriam Stark (1993) sees ethnoarchaeology not as a theory but a research strategy for answering archaeological questions in a living society. Though not very much aware of this term which happened to have coined as late as 1900 by J.W. Fewkes, sporadic ethnographic exercises1 were made from time to time that lien to the very theme of ethnoarchaeology – the use of ethnography to interpret the past. David and Kramer argue that 'ethnoarchaeology (is) developed in order to provide better ethnographic analogies to assist in the interpretation of archaeological data' (David and Kramer 2001: 43). And in essence, 'the use of analogy in interpreting archaeological evidence' (Lynton 1984: 63) is ethnoarchaeology. Ethnoarchaeology hence aims at the 'acquisition of ethnographic data to assist archaeological interpretation' (Politis 2007: 58) and mainly endeavours to establish 'relationships between human behaviour and its archaeological consequences in the present' (O'Connell 1995: 205). It is concerned with the investigation of the material culture and built environments of living people, in relation to the processes which effects and affects their conversion to archaeological context (Lane 2006: 402). Mainly three important goals of ethnoarchaeology may be identified: (*i*) to identify and explain patterns in relationships between human behaviour and its archaeological consequences in the present (O'Connell 1995: 205); (*ii*) to provide ethnographic data and explications of those data that are of direct relevance to the interpretation of archaeological materials and to model-building in archaeological practice (Kramer 1979, 1985; Schiffer 1978; Schwartz 1978); and (*iii*) to document

<sup>1</sup>Earlier works are connected with those of the towering evolutionary thinkers such as Tylor (1865), who tried to trace the history of civilization with the help of the knowledge of living primitive societies, and Morgan (1963), who on the strong emphasis on American Indian and Australian ethnography and that of other primitive societies proposed to devise stages of savagery, barbarism and civilization. Sir John Lubbock utilized general analogical research to 'throw some light on' (Lubbock 1865: xiii, 1) prehistoric peoples. Sven Nilsson (1866:27f.) also attempted to compare prehistoric material culture (stone axes, etc.) to contemporary South-American cultures. Sollas (1911) also tried to draw parallelism between the Mousterian culture and the Australian aborigines, the Aurignacian and the Bushman, and the Magdalenian and the Eskimo. Subsequent attempts (see Clark 1951; Thomas 1972; David 1973) also use ethnographic evidences in reconstructing the archaeological remains.

patterns in the ongoing society in order to reconstruct past behaviours from their extant material remnants (Rathje 1978: 49).

Extensive debate on the issue of analogy as the basic tool persisted throughout the ethnoarchaeological journey during the 1960s (e.g. Anderson 1969; Binford 1968a, b; Chang 1967; Clark 1968; Freeman 1968; Munson 1969), 1970s (Binford 1972; Orme 1974; Green 1973; Wobst 1978), 1980s and early 1990s (Charlton 1981; Gould and Watson 1982; Crawford 1982; Lange 1980; Murray and Walker 1988; Simms 1992; Stahl 1993; Wylie 1982, 1985, 1988). Though the issue with the use of analogy seemed decreasing with the advent of postmodern theory in archaeology and the subsequent reaction against it by scientifically oriented archaeologists in the 1990s and 2000s (Ravn 2011), obvious continuity between the prehistoric past and the ethnographic present has always favoured the utilization of ethnographic data in archaeological interpretation. It is seen that use of analogy or its allied tool was in vogue in all the three paradigmatic domains of archaeological theories – culture history, *new archaeology* and post-processual archaeology. An important endeavour of processual archaeology is the emergence of ethnoarchaeology as a direct result of the development of *actualistic*<sup>2</sup> studies not favouring the use of ethnographic analogy but the middle-range theory (MRT) – in order to bridge the gap between the dynamics of the living systems and the static nature of the archaeological record (Binford 1981; Schiffer 1978). Processualists argue that ethnographical data should only be used for model-building. These 'tested' and approved ethnographically based models mysteriously transform to be 'facts', beyond the analogical state. MRT is an ambitious enterprise that can establish links between day-to-day practice and can examine how the archaeological record was formed. Introduction of MRT to archaeology by Lewis Binford (1972) (borrowing Merton's [1967] sociological theory) was 'a means of getting contemporary facts from the present to statements about the past' (Binford 1977: 6). MRT, either as a theory, a concept or a series of methodologies of the *new archaeologists*, 'helps to project a systematic view of phenomena that took place in the past and to some extent provides systematic abstractions of the past' (Atici 2006: 34).

A different strand comes up in the 1980s with the rise of the post-processual or 'contextual' archaeology that never really explored the possibilities of MRT but carried on seeking to distinguish 'proper' analogies from 'improper' ones. Postprocessualists see ethnoarchaeology more as a field of discussion and testing of concepts (Hodder 1986) rather than a way towards ethnographic analogies or MRT (Binford 1983); and they put more importance to the issue of *context* suggesting that questions of *relevance*, *generality* and *goodness of fit* may strengthen analogies (Hodder 1982a: 22). Developed as an academic outcrop through the growing

<sup>2</sup>Lewis Binford (1981) placed ethnoarchaeology under the so-called *actualistic* studies. However, it 'differs from other actualistic studies (such as taphonomy or experimental archaeology) in that it includes the systematic observation of living societies. We can distinguish this sub discipline from other types of ethnographic research by its explicit focus on material culture and its interactions with social and cultural dynamics, and because it keeps archaeological research problems in mind' (Politis 2015:43–44).

influence of postmodern thought in the social sciences (Bintliff 1991; Duke 1995; Knapp 1996; Watson 1990), post-processual archaeology developed another ethnoarchaeological perspective to the study of modern material culture. The major shift from the processual MRT to post-processual ethnoarchaeology is a step away from simple observations of cause and effect(s) to complex areas of ideology, cosmology or ontology – a shift from *how* things were done to *why* they were done. Postprocessual approach to ethnoarchaeological research is more or less 'exploring the symbolic dimensions of material culture' (David and Kramer 2001: 54) and 'material culture studies' (e.g., Conkey 1989; Hodder 1986; Miller 1983, 1985) and exploring 'how people construct their material worlds. . . (R)ather than an adaptive response, culture and material culture are understood in relation to meaning' (Cunningham 2003: 398). These show another theoretical turn with the cessation of hot deliberations existed between processual and post-processual (for instance; Hegmon 2003 and Johnson 2006) schools of thought. Commenting this theoretical allegiance as not a defining issue, Hegmon (2003: 216) stated that post-processual emphases of agency, gender and meaning have been gradually incorporated into the processual mainstream, creating a category best described as 'processual-plus', thereby compromising processual objectives and methods with a greater awareness of post-processual critiques (Fancher 2009).

Another important research strategy other than ethnoarchaeology where analogy is also in use is the experimental archaeology. Here, archaeologists attempt to create an analogue of an artefact or ecofact through experiments to determine what behaviours caused these archaeological remains (Domínguez-Rodrigo 2008). Experimental archaeology builds on the knowledge of physical principles in order to investigate activities that might have happened in the past using the methods and material that would have actually been available (Outram 2008: 2). A good number of such experimental works relating, for instance, to 'process and function' can be undertaken on wide range of different artefactual or ecofactual materials which may include (but not restricted) phytoliths, bone, stone, pottery, metal, organic materials, residues, etc.

## **Putting Ethnography into Archaeological Context**

Since understanding the interaction between humans, things and their environment and trying to find areas of interest in interpreting the prehistoric record, there stand another field of ethnoarchaeology (Gould 1989), its potentials of undertaking ethnoarchaeological research on indigenous ethnic groups. This paper is a humble attempt to highlight general ways in which academic ethnoarchaeologists play active and dynamic role in structuring prehistory through varied theoretical lenses in archaeology. Obviously, ethnography as an excellent mirror to see the key factors involved in past human behaviour basically rests on the notion that as 'societies ... owing to their perceived "premodern" way of life, were deemed appropriate to be compared with archaeological contexts' (Hamilakis 2011: 402) and 'man in the past was not unlike primitive man studied by the anthropologists' (Orme 1981: 15).

As the most confident interpretation of a prehistoric artefact comes from discovery of a similar or identical implementation used by a living people (Anderson 1969, also see ManiBabu 2003), ethnographic analogy utilizes the ethnographic record as a source or analogue for making inferences about the unknown subject of past human behaviour. The 'ethnographic present' thus creates a sense of place as 'allochronous' (Fabian 1983) in archaeology; and especially the ones who have used ethnoarchaeological studies unreflectively and uncritically have often treated local people (and their agricultural practices) as examples of premodern situations, as living in another time (see, Fotiadis 1995).

Construing past human behaviour through the contemporary living peoples has bearings on a construct that humans' favourable strategies (including other sociocultural paraphernalia) are developed in order to adapt to the continuing ecosystem since the earliest past; and these are unmistakably transmitted through the *memes* in a continuing process. Indigenous communities have kept their cultures alive by passing on their worldview, their knowledge and know-how and their arts, rituals and performances through generations. An example of such a continuing system is that of extended memory of symbolic codes engraved on pieces of bone or in paintings on cave walls during upper Palaeolithic times (e.g. Mithen 1988; Marshack 1991; d'Errico 1995) that are supposed to have been transmitted to other individuals, perhaps across several generations (see Mithen 1998). Being a 'cultural gene' and a cultural replicator, *meme* is 'an entity that is capable of being transmitted from one brain to another' (Dawkins 1976: 210); and examples of *memes* include ideas, habits, skills, inventions, ways of making pots, building arches and ways of doing things that we copy from person to person by imitation (Dawkins 1976; Dennett 1995; Blackmore 1999, 2000). 'Artefacts can be viewed as the products of culturally transmitted information (cultural instructions or *memes*); in conjunction with the physical capacities or motor habits of the makers as well as stochastic factors working upon materials found in the environment' (Tschauner 1996: 25). Obviously, peoples' present lifeways being transmitted at least in memetic principle may have a little stock of the earlier accomplishment and skill; and obviously these reflect the natural analogues for the past and also direct means of understanding extended survivals of earlier human system, providing us with information about the totality of the past. It is asserted that the purpose of using ethnography in interpreting archaeological features however is not to extrapolate contemporary situations and human behaviour back into the past but to provide a framework through which we can formulate new working hypothesis for a better understanding of the archaeological record.

Yet, this issue is not free from critiques also. Michael Shanks and Ian Hodder commented that 'it is inadequate to assume that some cultures in space and time are more "like us" than others are' (Shanks and Hodder 1995: 10). Fahlander (2004), also see Binford 1962) finds direct historical analogies inherently flawed and reiterated that because the past is in many respects 'unknown' and not necessarily similar to any practices of the contemporary world; basing our models of interpretation upon contemporary, cross-cultural data seems 'irrelevant and somewhat "unimaginative'" (Fahlander 2004: 185). Commenting on the general use of ethnographic data of surviving hunter-gatherer populations in South Asia (Andhra Pradesh, Madhya, Karnataka, the Andamans, etc.) for the archaeological interpretation of prehistoric hunter-gatherers, it is pointed out that why models for the South Asian Palaeolithic need to be derived exclusively or even primarily from South Asian hunter-gatherers (Paddayya 1982, also see Binford 1980). 'It is a very tenuous link indeed to argue for direct historic continuity between presentday hunter-gatherers and those of the Paleolithic. The demonstration of such a link is not theoretically necessary nor, I suspect, is it justified' (Sinopoli 1991: 179). However, Daniel Stiles (2001) reiterated that 'except where direct historical continuity can be demonstrated between the archaeological remains and an existing society, everyone seems to be agreed that no one *h-g* (*hunter-gatherer*) group can be used as a specific analogy to explain unrelated archaeological material' (Stiles 2001: 54); and for analogical purpose, the 'living *h-g* groups need to be chosen carefully depending on the research objectives' (Stiles 2001: 58).

## **Ethnoarchaeology in Manipur**

There are ample ethnoarchaeological scopes in dealing with the ethnographic present, which involves practicability for archaeological use. It however does not mean that the indigenous lifeways are a replica of either pre- or proto*-*historic system but may be perceived as an empirical mirror since the indigenous system of adaptation is in consonance to their natural and cultural surrounding in a continuing process. This has immense implications to such a good number of indigenous tribal populations nestled in the eastern extension of Western Himalayas, who are experiencing a subtropical climatic situation and pulling their lifeways amidst globalization and new religious faiths. And this refers to those northeastern Indian Mongoloid populations, particularly those in Manipur. who have myriad strategies towards adapting the natural surroundings.

The state of Manipur, located at the northeastern most part of India, is a land of over two and half dozen different tribes who inhabit sporadically in the centrally located valley and thickly in the surrounding hilly terrains. The tribes are either affiliated to one of the three linguistic groups (Naga Bodo, Eastern Naga and Kuki-Chin) of the Tibeto-Burman family. For instance, under the Naga Bodo group, among others, Kabui and Khoirao are included. Maram, Tangkhul, Maring, etc. are within the Eastern Naga group. Aimol, Anal, Chiru, Hmar, Kom, Purum, Vaiphei, etc. are the tribal groups who belong to the Old Kuki subgroup of the larger Kuki-Chin. Likewise, Paite, Thadou, etc. are included under the Northern Chin subgroup of the Kuki-Chin. These tribes have more or less similar sociocultural setups and also economic adaptation pattern. The traditional social system is strongly maleoriented, where the principle of organization fundamentally is to the agnation who governed residence, descent, access to economic resources, political affiliation and linkages through marriage, etc.

In essence, ethnoarchaeological research works in Manipur as well as in Northeast India are negligibly fewer in number. Sporadic works though claimed to be ethnoarchaeological are also not within its proper academic framework. The research ventures within appropriate and demanded theoretical and methodological frameworks may yield new interpretative models which may help to structure the archaeological past. Yet, while dealing with ethnoarchaeology, for instance, proper framework is a must since:

Mere accumulation of ethnographic data and the provision of *half-baked* generalisations with the usual cautionary note 'more needs to be done on this subject' are in effect obstructing the development of the type of research in ethnoarchaeology that would contribute viable theoretical formulations. (Agorsah 1990: 190)

It is also a regular phenomenon with 'many scholars who do ethnographic research and are able to make even the most tenuous link between their material and archaeology have enjoyed the liberty of claiming that they are doing ethnoarchaeology' (Agorsah 1990: 192).

In terms of lithic prehistory in Manipur, a number of sporadic works have been exercised in order to have a prehistoric picture of the area. And it is needless to comment that prehistoric research in this part of the country is still sticks, more or less to the embryonic *time-space* framework and yet to work with the ongoing and most competing processual and post-processual approach of research domains. Taking into account the globally changing prehistoric research paradigms and also considering the significances the region has in terms of her geographical proximity and archaeological propinquity with Southeast Asian countries, higher levels of academic ventures are needed to pursue at all perceptible research areas. However, this does not mean that the work done so far has little significance in structuring her prehistory. In spite of the fact that the traditional and descriptive archaeology is unmistakably the basic foundation of prehistory through the ages, new theoretical frameworks could make furtherance in explaining and structuring the prehistoric past with systematic tinge. We all should agree that there lack a large bodies of information, the lacunae that surrounds the issues with the structuring her prehistory, and for it all the researchers should share responsibilities. Apparently, one of the reasons behind overlooking the theoretical paradigms in dealing with the issue owed to the workers' flaccid vision with the present scientific and methodological trends duly conceded with the long-run traditionalist *time-space* mindset.

Unmistakably, besides the activities with *shovel and trowel*, there is a need to document other dimensions of humans, the extraction of which are beyond the limit to that of lithic study. As outlined above, contemporary indigenous people still possess ideal archaeological potentialities. In fact, Manipur vis-à-vis Northeast India deserves for wide-ranging ethnoarchaeological radicals owing to the fact that indigenous tribal populations in both the plain and hilly flanks still retain some of their traditional adaptive practices interwoven with the traditional mundane domain (amidst globalization and embracement of alien religious faiths), for instance, in terms of subsistence economy (swidden and hill-terrace cultivation), land holding pattern, food habit, healing practices, traditional craft (subsistence technologies, carved houses more among the Nagas, handmade pottery with cord-marked decoration, bark cloth making, etc.), megalithism, disposal of the dead and many more – some of which have Neolithic bearings. Naturally, these strategies, decisions and actions have essences on archaeological dialogues. A review article *On the Scope of the Ethnoarchaeological studies in Manipur* (ManiBabu 1988–89) has highlighted at least some of the potential research areas, such as, in terms of economy, material culture including house type, mortuary practices, megalithism, etc. And regarding the more challenging academic issues related with Stone Age, prehistory may include:

... seeking cogency of the Movius line hypothesis, digging into the problem of Homo erectus:Homo *sapiens* and *core tool: flake tool* dichotomy; catching on whether tangible archaeological patterns reflect interactions or shared ancestry; maneuvering efficacy of *essentialist vs nominalist* approaches to the analysis and classification of Manipuri lithic artefacts, etc. (ManiBabu 2009: 33)

However, to highlight research priorities from among the myriad potential archaeological fields in a region like Manipur or any other northeastern Indian states – where neither is nor was at any of the arising proper research strategies – is not as cumbersome as searching a small piece of thread over a dark floor. The region, at present, stands at its apex of myriad prehistoric research potency. Though many tribal societies of the area are less pristine, they offer excellent opportunities for ethnoarchaeology on any of its strains of inquiry. Planned archaeological projects may include various fields (such as experimental archaeology, contextual archaeology, Marxist archaeology, archaeology of landscape, cognitive, *individual*, wetland, gender and many more) in the same manner as one can go for any ethnographic research agenda. As 'our discipline is so broad ... (and) none of us can, in his own research, encompass the whole field' (Rouse 1965: 2), one can explore potentials of either the Binfordian or Hodderian frameworks (or both) pertaining with the domains of ecological and materialist explanations or more concerned with a diversity of behavioural insights for a fuller understanding. Besides the fundamental ventures of exploring and excavating more of Stone Age sites, one can go with any of the following fields (but not restricted to), irrespective of research priorities: (a) human strategy of adaptation and interaction with their habitat in order to recognize behavioural flexibility and diversity (scientific *processual* framework) and (b) human plurality of knowledge and meaning (humanistic *post-processual* framework). In regard to the *first* research agenda, one may go with, for example, food-producing and -procuring/gathering activities, settlement strategies (including highland and wetlands), traditional technologies and indigenous craftsmanship, to name a few. And for the *second* one, all of the nonmaterial aspects of human culture and behaviour may come up in terms of cognition, symbolism, contextual framework and meaning of the systems, social organization, belief systems and what not. In this regard, the prime area of commonalities between agency theory and evolutionary analysis of human behaviour may also explore especially in relation to the peoples' social and symbolic behaviour. A few concrete examples that have ethnoarchaeological potentials may refer to the adaptation pattern of the indigenous people to the surrounding physical environment, thereby creating a 'cultural landscape'. Cultural landscape manifests a social space of human interaction to the physical environment denoting a deep sense of human creativity and variability. And variable physical landscapes always go hand in hand with peoples' dynamic cultural tradition. This is the idea on landscape studies by the post-processual archaeologists. The physical surroundings or the world humans live in may bear different meanings, and different schools of thought are associated with these terms (Shanks and Hodder 1995).

One of the examples of such landscape in the hilly flanks of Manipur includes, among others, the phenomenon of exploiting the naturally occurring rock boulders towards manifesting *practical* and *prestige* technologies. This obviously reflects the world view of the respective tribal group; and the art that surrounds the system is transmitting through generations since the earliest times till today. Mention may be made of two significant features seen among all the indigenous tribal populations in Manipur, such as the traditional way of using large hewn or natural stone blocks and boulders (i) as material manifestation of symbol of a man's status in the society by way of erecting these as megalithic monuments (as prestige technology) and (ii) as perimeter of one's habitation boundary area/forest land or as practical technology to make a sloppy habitation site into a plain level so as to make them easier to make shelters, etc. The peoples' way of management of stone boulders reflects the kincentric relationship that an indigenous culture maintains with their natural resources, thereby creating a cultural landscape. The materiality of such large stones in its *living archaeological* contexts manifests the peoples' world view, status, landscape, territoriality and what not and could make ethnographic postulates operable to the archaeologists towards highlighting prehistoric cultural landscapes (ManiBabu 2014a). Appropriate ethnoarchaeological tool in such attempts is subject to the context of the research area and the gravity of data in hand.

Another important issue within the perspective of cultural landscape is the domain of *space syntax* of megaliths; some preliminary works of which have also been attempted (ManiBabu 2014a; Philip and ManiBabu 2015) on some megalithic sites located in the Naga-inhabited villages. Through the *space syntax* research on the distributional pattern of megaliths, a *spatial ontology* can be inferred on the relations between spatial configuration and the social functioning of space of monuments. It is observed that 'spatial distributions of monuments are related with the spaces where there is a maximum accessibility of human movement' (Philip and ManiBabu 2017: 32; also see ManiBabu 2014a). Obviously, if a landscape comprising these characters along with other tangible traces of human activity, such as potholes, associated habitation debris, landform modifications attributable to man, etc., are found distributed over a deserted area, this has great ethnoarchaeological potentialities towards shedding light on 'settlement archaeology' of the area on the basis of the present ethnographic postulates on how the present tribal people interacts with their surrounding environment. With this, other human aspects related with subsistence, polity, society and many others can also be addressed accordingly subject to the nature of data in hand.

Beyond such ethnoarchaeological domains, another interesting and intriguing area is in terms of the development of various crafts and technologies for myriad subsistence pursuits. Peoples' strategies to gather and produce food entails various processes suitable to the environment where they settled – the landform pattern, climatic stipulation, potentials of natural resources and many more. Hunting and fishing activities by the tribal people of Manipur entail the development of myriad strategies in accordance with the environment they lived. Making of different kinds of fishing implements and appliances, such as baskets, nets, snares, spears, traps, etc., is all the resultant technologies which gave way with different locational character, nature and content of waterbodies. The same is in the hunting practices also. Some unique hunting strategies seen in bygone days among the Tangkhul Nagas of the northeasternly Ukhrul district of the state are very much a part of the hunters' manifestation in their food-procuring strategies. Besides using the long hairs of a horse's tail for trapping wild birds, such as pheasants, wild fowls, doves and other birds of medium size (Shimray 1976), they used to develop trapping techniques (called 'Vakhong') to catch a particular small bird (locally termed as 'Shiri' of about 8 inches long) using a large number of big *uningthou* trees (*Phoebe hainesiana* Brandis; Family, Lauraceae) grown in the nearby forests.

Another most challenging practice connected with food-producing economy among the hill tribes of the state, as done in other parts of northeastern India, Southeast Asia and highlanders of Pacific and beyond, is the 'slash-and-burn' system of cultivation. Besides its genesis to the Neolithic period, this agricultural practice possesses a number of archaeological implications in terms of its adaptational character in a hilly environment, its application of simple technology and other traceable corresponding activities in archaeological contexts. Since ethnoarchaeology may proceed at various levels of complexity depending on the ultimate use to which the data are to be put (Binford 1972, 1968a, b; Gould 1968; Watson 1979; White 1967), the present issue is to identify and accumulate specific material and/or behavioural traces of subsistence activities that will remain as part of the archaeological features. The general operational character of shifting agriculture permits archaeologists to identify vast traces of cultivators' activities, such as (a) traces of charcoal pieces and ashes dispersed over and beneath a sloppy hilly soil; (b) perimetric features that mark the boundaries of cultivated plots, small rock boulders in rows or otherwise, spatial distribution of accumulated medium- to large-sized rock boulders over an area put together while preparing *jhum* fields so that these may not affect the soil or otherwise managing to get wider space for sowing seeds; (c) material traces of temporary huts constructed in the *jhum* fields – its foundational floors – along with those activities concerning cooking and eating, such as structure of a hearth constructed mainly with a composite of three medium-sized stones placed each in a triangular equidistance pattern so that a cooking vessel can fit to place over it; and (d) raised ramparts that facilitate farmers to make strict vigil over the crops grown from a raised height and many more items, such as betel, cigarettes and playing cards, pieces of old/torn cloth, combs, sandals, batteries, etc. Regarding the first character, obviously:

Ephemeral surface fires may prove difficult to detect after the wind blows the remains around. On the other hand, when the earth is scooped out very deeply and fires burn for a long time, it is easier to detect and recognise as human controlled actions, possibly many years or millennia afterwards.

Some ethnoarchaeological approaches to soil micromorphology with the goal of obtaining reference material on anthropogenic fires (see Goldberg and Whitebread 1993 and Wattez 1992) are significant to mention with this issue.

All these attempts are (i) to document visible *archaeological signatures* that could give an ethnographic postulate of activities related to man's interaction with their physical surroundings and (ii) to situate the dynamic archaeological past through the static ethnographic present against the backdrop of the present ethnoarchaeological pursuit. It is however a problem with the archaeologists to translate inanimate objects and features into a model of behaviour. Although the problems are substantial, they are not insuperable. The idea of studying how past peoples disposed themselves upon the land in order to understand the nature of their social, political and economic structure – what Parsons (1972: 128) aptly terms the 'sociology of architectural remains' – goes back at least to the explorers and amateur archaeologists of the nineteenth century.

Some more important features of archaeological significances other than those highlighted above include fire and pottery-making, which are rooted in its genesis in prehistoric periods. Fire is a very important aspect of human life. Control of fire, on the other hand, is a crucial aspect of human life, undeniably involving foresight and renunciation of primary impulses, which has been in existence not just for 1 or 2 generations and not even for 10–20 generations but for many thousands of generations (see Goudsblom 1992). Impact of fire on human anatomy, particularly on teeth size, has been proposed by many. Smaller size of Neanderthal molar teeth than those of his forebears owes to obligatory cooking by the former, which led to considerably reduction on the amount of time they spent in chewing and allowing the mutation effect to the reduction of dental size (Brace 1995: 228). Wrangham, Jones, Laden, Pilbeam and Conklin-Brittain (1999) argue that *Homo erectus* fossils show a markedly reduced tooth size as well, due to cooking – an argument for the domestication of fire. Fire played an important role in early human cultures as well. Fire worship and divination were early forms of religion. Trial by fire was even used as a legal system (Pyne 1999). Concept of sacred fire is prevalent in every known societies of Manipur – irrespective of the plain and hill dwellers. The significance of it lies in every socioreligious occasions and festivals. Among the Kabui tribe, making of fire on the first day of *Gaan Ngai* and *Rih Ngai* festivals is a must. Besides the sacred fire at Andro,3 almost every festivals or communal observances of the tribe are accompanied with the production of fire by friction method which is considered as sacred. The role of fire in the plain Meitei society is also immense4 .

<sup>3</sup>Sacred fire at Andro, a Chakpa village to the east of Imphal valley, is posited at the shrine of the *Nongpok Ningthou* (a village deity) and has archaeological significances in view of the peoples' construct that it is both a consecrate and sacred object of the past; and its continual burning has been kept uninterruptedly since time immemorial and is one of the oldest of its kind in the world. Members of every household of the 13 Andro hamlets (*leikai*) comprehend the task of maintaining its continuation though a routine feeding of firewood by rotation on every morning. And such an act is strictly observed by the people. It is to the astonishment of the people that the quantity of the ashes caused by continual firing does not increase but remains as it was.

<sup>4</sup>The age-old tradition among the Meiteis to expose oneself to the kindling fire (people called such act as *mei-okpa*) before entering the residential gate after some days of his/her leaving home has symbolic significances. The world view of such an act lies with the warding off of evil spirits that

Pottery also has great ethnoarchaeological significances. Studies on earthen vessels form an important area of ethnoarchaeological study both in south (Sinopoli 1991) and southeast Asia (Griffin and Solheim 1990). In this part of the country, first attempt on this archaeological issue was made on ceramics (ManiBabu 2005). With this initial research venture on ceramic ethnoarchaeology on the Andro pottery, a pot making Chakpa population in the valley of Manipur subsequent works led to highlight different areas on the organization of ceramic production, procurement strategies and cultural factors of primary ceramic resources (ManiBabu 2012a) on the archaeological significances of cultural transmission of the art of pot making (ManiBabu 2012b, 2014b); on correlating ceramic vessel form to function (ManiBabu 2011–2012), ceramic reuse and discard behaviour (ManiBabu 2010); on the monopoly of pottery production (ManiBabu 2012c); etc. other than other aspects (ManiBabu 2013). Besides these, two other pot making tribal communities have also been studied within

ethnoarchaeological perspectives, such as Nungbi pottery of Ukhrul district (ManiBabu 2006a) and Paomai pottery of the Oinam village in the Senapati district (ManiBabu 2006b; Vidyani and ManiBabu 2017). Yet it is felt that in spite of a large number of ceramic ethnoarchaeological researches among the pot making populations of Manipur, certainly there still have many areas to seek towards furtherance of human behaviour as indicated by ceramic system and as demanded by the existing theoretical framework. A holistic ceramic ethnoarchaeological approach in terms of ceramic petrography is one of the utmost worth dealing areas that combines ceramic morphologies with chemical (e.g. INAA, ICP-MS, XRF), mineralogical (especially XRD) and microstructural (SEM) data. This information, in addition to ethnographic information, shall provide a powerful analytical strategy for understanding the social, political, economic and environmental contexts of ceramic production, distribution and consumption – which are all vital for developing robust interpretations of ancient social organization and change.

Since many potential areas and their realities in terms of their content and spirit warrant lengthier deliberations and comments and as the space in the *chapter* of the present *volume* is not in consonance to their accommodations, only a few of them have been addressed in the present discussion. However, the present discussion will come to an end with one very interesting and intriguing area of ethnoarchaeological domains. This refers to the disposal of death. Disposal of the dead becomes an important focus of archaeological research through the rise of investigations of culture-historical, processual and post-processual approaches. The traditional cultural-historical approach examined burial practices in connection with religious ideas or beliefs about an afterlife (e.g. Wiesner 1938). The diffusionist approach, however, admitted mortuary forms as a means of tracing cultural influences and delineating cultural entities (Evans 1929; Persson 1931; Miller 1998) rather than

might have afflicted or accompanied with that particular individual. And such an act is also seen among the mother of small babies (ManiBabu 1994a). The protection of small babies from malevolent spirits and the evil eyes of *hingchabi* (a female possessed by evil spirit) is manifested with this means of *mei-okpa*. A mother exposes herself to the fire before hugging her child and also the clothes of the child; and mothers that are made dry after washing, etc. are to go through such a *mei-okpa.*

seeking to interpret the mortuary forms themselves. Under the influence of the *new archaeology* of the 1960s and 1970s, emphasis has come to be placed upon mortuary variability rather than upon normative practices. Saxe (1970) and Binford (1971) focused attention on the social dimensions of mortuary practices, arguing that the mortuary record reflected the social organization of the society. Both the works distinguish two components of any social circumstance that are symbolically recognized in mortuary situations. Archaeologists' interests on secondary disposal of death sometimes turned to pragmatic explanations – suggesting that the incidence of secondary disposal among hunter-gatherers is directly correlated with the degree of settlement mobility and subsistence stress (Byrd and Monahan 1995; Hofman 1985; Walthall 1999).

Ethnography of mortuary practices of different ethnic groups of Manipur as well as of northeastern India has been negligibly studied little; but surprisingly ethnoarchaeologists have paid no attention to an area that concerns archaeology so directly. Typically three types of disposal of the dead are known among the ethnic groups of Manipur – cremation (among the plain Meiteis), burial (among the larger tribal populations) and post-cremation-secondary burial (among the Chakpa and some other non-Christian tribal sects). The traditional cultural spirit and content of the first two forms have, to a large extent, been diluted with the embracement of the new religious sects, such as Christianity among the tribals and Hinduism among the Meitei. The archetypal burial system with categorical rituals and observances is no more prevalent among the tribes of Manipur, yet it is retained, at least among some the non-Christian Kabui sects. However, Chakpa5 (or Loi) people are still maintaining their age-old 'post-cremation-urn-burial' system. This mode is characterized by the two phases of disposal – cremation of the corpse and then burial of the remnant burnt bones categorically. Mortuary practice among the Chakpa is a fundamental expression of religious ideology as well as ethnic identity, which can be seen among the Phayeng, a constituent of the larger Chakpa population (ManiBabu 1994b). The mortuary behaviour of the Phayeng is characterized by a system of cognition on conventional lamentation of death by which a disruption of social and personal bonds between the dead and kinsfolk is created. Ethnoarchaeologists dealing with mortuary practices have several further implications – such as the scale and complexity of funeral rites and associated material culture that are correlated with dimensions of the deceased's social persona. Other than the myriad areas that ethnoarchaeologists can go deeper, there are more rooms to interpret the issue of symbolism of human existence and their significance in the mundane world that have been continuing since time memorial to a given population. In fact, different Hodderian issues (Hodder 1982a, b, c, 1986) in terms of constitutive meaning,

<sup>5</sup>Chakpa or Loi 'very closely resembles the Meitheis' (Hodson 1908: 3) but is 'not recognized as pure Manipuri (and) appear to be descendants of the former inhabitants of Moirang. They were one of the original tribes though formerly independent but were subdued ages ago (Brown 1975: 14). According to G.H. Damant (1880), the term *Loi* means 'slave or dependant'. The rule of degradation by the Meitheis into the Loi group was common practice as a punishment (Allen et al. 1984: 618; Brown 1975: 14; Hodson 1908: 10). The Chakpa society is a microcosm of the larger Meitei society, for there exists a parallelism in respect of social organization of the two.

agency, materiality, symbolism, cognition, engendered, etc. can be assessed with the ethnoarchaeology of mortuary practices.

## **Concluding Remarks**

Some important aspects that ethnoarchaeologists could venture with living indigenous people of Manipur in order to expand the objectives of interpreting the human past have been placed tentatively. Some of the areas discussed above agree with Welinder's (1994) aims of ethnoarchaeology that concern (a) to discuss how humans and things interact or, phrased in a different and perhaps better way, how humans interact in a physical environment and (b) to construct and discuss ideas and concepts to be used in the study of prehistoric archaeology. With this came to light that there are myriad ethnoarchaeological research potentialities centred on varied ethnographic present of the indigenous populations in Manipur, in terms of their natural and cultural adaptive strategies. Seeking at large, the material consequences for human behaviours form important foci of ethnoarchaeological work. Proper documentation and study on these attributes within proper ethnoarchaeological frameworks shall provide opportunity to evaluate models that surrounds the material and nonmaterial cultural systems.

While interpreting the past, by considering the facts of ethnoarchaeological nature, one should have the technical expertise to make proper documentation of the data so that the mute artefacts could speak back. The continuing confrontation between theoretical domains at different time periods experienced archaeology to go through 'paradigm shifts' – giving rise to a *three-tier* academic realms of *history*, *science* and *humanism.* Robert Bednarik (2003: 512) has rightly opined that 'archaeology as a discipline possesses no autonomous universal theory (cf. Binford 1977). Its theoretical underpinnings are a potpourri of theories and scraps of theories, imported, often in corrupted form, from other disciplines'. Archaeologists' engagement with contemporary small-scale societies at developing better explanation of past human culture makes to the spatio-temporal expansion of myriad theoretical issues within this *three-tier* domain. To combine them with ethnographic accounts often demands the right to partake of the research endeavour (see Hamilakis and Anagnostopoulos 2009). Yet, reconstructing a systemic context, the history of their past *living contexts* demands ethnoarchaeologists' academic paraphernalia of the research area concerned. And if not exercised properly, the same will deviate from the real historical track. As 'the dead cannot come back and tell archaeologists they are wrong' **(**Kuznar 1997: 162), 'it is the belief that archaeology deals with dead people who cannot answer back and contest our account of them that has been heavily eroded and problematized' (Hamilakis 2011: 401). Hence, it is needless to mention that one should be very much cautious and conscious in dealing with the issues in terms of the field techniques, documentation and interpretations that the discipline has. One should be very much aware of using ethnographic analogy for archaeological interpretation and should only use a source of ideas to broaden the horizons of possibilities about how the past might be interpreted (Hodder 1999: 46). Oestigaard (2000) has rightly commented that by exploring the connection between material culture and human behaviour in different ethnographic societies, it is possible to combine the meanings of archaeological objects in the past with living societies today, comparing ethnographic and archaeological patterning, with special reference to excavated material.

Beyond these issues, an important concern with the archaeology of Manipur which has received little or no attention is about the so-called pseudoarchaeology*.* In fact, this global issue comes up on the part of those enthusiastic laymen or amateurs who claimed very much 'archaeological' in their work but in fact violate archaeological ethics, scientific methodology and practices while dealing with the real archaeological problems. And in doing so, there are many ill-informed ideas in terms of documentation and interpretation, owing to their lack of proper academic technicalities. Now '… pseudoarchaeology is one of the two greatest challenges to contemporary archaeologists - the other being the destruction of archaeological remains' (Williams 1991: 8; also see Stiebing 1987: 2). This global issue of destruction of archaeological remains and sites is of great concern to all archaeologists. The fact is that natural and the anthropogenic activities destroy potential archaeological sites every minute. In such a situation, instead of the well-planned excavators, *shovelbums* ought to have significances in dealing with the issue of collecting and documenting data from the sites about to be destroyed, with lesser degree of right archaeological bearings. People of the state of Manipur have already suffered with the impact of globalization and new religious faiths – that obviously make a change in the peoples' indigenous sociocultural domain and thereby bear upon the ethnoarchaeological course of investigation. A general prediction by archaeologists is that population growth, economic development, growth of cities and suburbs, development of transformation systems, elite acquisitiveness, etc. will pose enormous threats to the in situ archaeological records throughout the world during the coming centuries; and Manipur is not an exception with the problem. And this issue has bearings with another most important concern of archaeology, the Cultural Resource Management, which aims to conserve, manage and preserve the archaeological record of the past for future generations. This dominant paradigm in archaeology has relevancy in Manipur also.
