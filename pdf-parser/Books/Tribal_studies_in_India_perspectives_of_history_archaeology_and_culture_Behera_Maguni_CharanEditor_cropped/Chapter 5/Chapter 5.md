#### **Joseph Bara**

**Abstract** This chapter tries to examine sluggish and uneven growth of British colonial education in the tribal hinterland of Chhotanagpur in the then Bengal province despite the fact that the system was introduced as early as 1839 in the region and received attention from different quarters. First, the system received considerable impetus in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries from the colonial agenda of 'civilizing' the 'barbarians'. For this task, the government usually relied upon the services of missionaries. The efforts of the missionaries, their humanitarian attitude towards the tribals notwithstanding, were ineluctably marred by the constraints of their mission field and prejudiced missionary paradigm. Owing to this, the missionaries were unable to devise a pro-tribal educational policy, thus leading to the tribals receiving the faulty system on their own terms. While the tribals valorized certain aspects of the system; they were, unlike elsewhere, unable to further develop the system through indigenous initiative. The chapter takes a stock of all these issues.

This article is concerned with the impact of colonial educational policy on remote local societies of India in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. It sets out the manner of its engagement with local forces and the type of educational growth it fostered. The case is presented through the prism of two numerically and culturally dominant agricultural tribes, namely, the Mundas and

Uraons, of the Chhotanagpur area along the south-western fringe of Bengal province.1 Three considerations prompted the choice. First, the province with numerous schools and colleges was educationally most vibrant in colonial India. Ideally this should have led to a diffusion of ideas and policies into the outlying parts. Second is the choice of 'tribe', because the referent was perceived, in the colonial cultural discourse, as the opposite of the 'advanced' populations of the plains. This meant that the British, while working out policy for the area, were largely free from the constraint of contending with culturally articulate demands that they had to invariably deal with when working out the same for, say, the Bengal heartland.2 And lastly, for the remarkable reason that while even the educational 'Boeotia of India', as adjacent Bihar was termed,3 experienced a semblance of benefit out of the experiments of leading Bengal educationists (such as Iswarchandra Vidyasagar and Bhudev Mukherjee), the tribal area of Chhotanagpur was hardly touched by any notable provincial scheme until the late nineteenth century.4

The government schemes were first manifest in the region mainly after 1870 when, following a heated debate on educational cess, the government of Bengal took a major initiative in popular education.5 The following year the 'Campbell scheme', named after the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal (1871–74), was the first provincial popular education scheme to reach Chhotanagpur.6 Taking this as the point of departure, the article charts educational developments in Chhotanagpur for a period of almost 60 years following the 'Campbell scheme'. It closes the discussion in 1930, significant for it being the year of the Indian Statutory Commission's review of the performance of the colonial state in connection with India's preparedness for democracy.

The government pursued educational expansion under the then in vogue theory of 'filtration' (enunciated in 1835) which envisioned the downward percolation of education from the upper classes to the masses.7 Under this policy, the Governor General of India hastened to clarify in 1840 that it 'was not to be implied … that …elementary education for the mass of the people is a thing to be neglected or

postponed for an indefinite period'.8 The 'filtration' theory, however, had little real-time impact with education for most part remaining trapped in the upper strata of society. The lack of a policy for popular education apart, the 'filtration' theory's shortcomings in practice became a live public agenda, continually discussed and debated in official and non-official circles of almost all parts of colonial India but more so in Bengal. Such public engagements, perhaps, despite the 'filtration' policy's official enunciation, led the authorities in Bengal to institute a survey with a view to exploring ways of educating the masses. The survey, conducted by William Adam, a Calcutta-based former missionary and philanthropist, resulted in a detailed report on the state of the indigenous system. The report did not, in any sense, provide grounds for action but supplied more than enough data for discussion, which by the way continued till well after the government's official commitment to mass education under the Court of Directors's Despatch of Education, 1854.9

Though public discourse on the matter carried on unabated at the headquarter town of Calcutta, the decibel of the debate alone was not enough to inspire permeation of policies into distant areas. Especially left outs were the large outlying tribal tracts on the frontier of the province in the north-east and south-west. The educational beginnings in these parts were obscure local projects, initiated by local officials in direct consultation with the Calcutta authorities. Even though the projects were integrated into the provincial policies, certain local features persisted. This sets a distinct pattern of educational growth in the tribal areas.

Existing writings on the state of popular education in Bengal rarely transcend the range of the plains districts.10 The assumption, so far as the tribes are concerned, seems to be that the model of the plains was uncritically extended to the tribal areas and a similar development followed. Even when 'certain peculiarities' of the tribal situation are manifest, scholars continue to treat the inception and development of education in tribal areas as simply the spilling over of policies from the plains.11 Certain studies however hint that schemes of tribal education originated locally, based upon British perception of the tribes. And this perception, the colonial idea of 'tribe', was a factor in the educational growth of the tribal regions.12 This article argues that the cultural condition of the tribes not only forced the British to devise and follow special policies but also shaped an idiosyncratic local pattern of growth and response to colonial action.

## **Educational Initiation of the Tribals**

Developments in popular education made in the Bengal mainland were unable to tide over into Chhotanagpur, primarily due to their being sapped midway by middleclass interests.13 Against this, the first Anglo-vernacular school was established at Kishenpur14 in Chhotanagpur in 1839. The school was the personal initiative of T. Wilkinson, the first Political Agent to the Governor General of the 'South-West Frontier Agency'—the new name then given to Chhotanagpur (1834).15 The region was hitherto governed from outlying camp offices. With the administration of the district brought under their purview, the officials were far too stretched to pay any attention to the school, whereas catching up with the Bengal rate of educational growth demanded focussed effort.

The local cultural situation too was not hospitable to the school. The tribals were a non-literate society with an oral tradition, living a simple and contented life by choice. For shaping the youth as useful members of society, they had indigenous institutions, *giti-ora* and *dhumkuria* in case of the Mundas and Uraons, respectively. The training was informal and practical. Also, the tribals had since medieval times become highly suspicious of institutions accompanying migrant social groups. This was because almost all the immigrants of the past had used the institutions they brought along to deprive the tribals of their traditional land rights and related privileges called *bhuinhari*. If, for these reasons, the tribals were indifferent to the Kishenpur School, the non-tribal migrant groups were, for other reasons, no less cold to it. The migrants were ambitious people, their chief motivation being the making of money by feudal methods of exploitation—a situation aggravated by the annexation of the region to the British Empire in 1765. The small number of migrant government officials posted in the area preferred to educate their children at their native places.

The Kishenpur British School was sustained by the 'white man's burden'. The tribes described as dregs of Indian society, almost animalistic in their mental and emotional make-up, were construed as being in greater need of the 'civilizational' cure purveyed by Western education.16 Caught between the shortage of colonial

<sup>15</sup> Jha (1979). The new name was the result of administrative organization following the Kol Revolt (1831–1832).

<sup>16</sup>This gripped the nineteenth-century Western mind widely. For instance, William Adam took an out-of-way opportunity to advocate 'moral conquest' of the tribals of Chhotanagpur by education in his final survey report of 1838. By citing the case of Tartars' civilization, the Macaulay's Minutes of 1835 propounded a theoretical proposition in this respect. See Adam (1838: 221–22), Kumar (1970: 465); Letter dated 11 June 1859 from E.T. Dalton, Deputy Commissioner, Chotanagpur to W. Gordon Young, director, Public Instruction, Bengal, appended to *General Report on Public Instruction in the Lower Provinces of Bengal*, *1869–70*, p. 48. (Hereafter *GRPI*, *Lower Provinces*, *Bengal* and respective year)

officials required to run the school well and the urgency of it, the authorities looked for a way and discovered the Christian missionaries. The missionary denominations that answered the colonialists' call were the Gossner Evangelical Lutheran (GEL) Mission from Germany, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (SPG) from Britain and the Jesuits from Belgium. They all promised the government to be good educators of the tribals and indeed proved to be so. They did not merely educate but did so in the much in vogue social service mode.17 Humanitarian approach won the missionaries a large following among the tribals, and Christian allegiance became a precursor to their joining the schools.18 The government made use of the new provision of grant-in-aid enshrined in the policy of 1854 as a special case to sponsor the missionaries. At this period, both the use of grants-in-aid system for popular education and the involvement of Christian missionaries in Western education became contentious issues in neighbouring regions.19 The government, however, in its Despatch of 1854 acknowledged the suitability of Christian missionaries conducting 'civilizing' education among the 'uncivilized races', that is, the tribes of India.20

In Chhotanagpur, the missionaries' performance was up to the expectation of the government. E.T. Dalton, the local Commissioner, stated in 1871 that 'In truth of the matter of education, I do not now see any method of teaching the Munda and Uraon stock, who form more than half of the entire population of the Loharduggah district except through the agency of the Missionaries'.21 The government's forthrightness was based on certain pragmatic and ideological considerations. First of all, finding an alternative non-governmental agency was impossible.22 The local non-tribals, including those involved in teaching at government schools, were contrary to the missionaries' humanitarian attitude, highly prejudiced against the tribals, looking down upon them as '*mlechchh*'.23 The question of an internal initiative did not arise, as British education for the tribals at this stage was 'as unsuitable to their condition as raiment of purple and fine linen'.24

The important thing to note here is that the missionaries and colonial state concurred on the need for drastic reform through the means of Western education. Even in the case of the most backward and obstinate segments, such as the tribes, there was agreement on the viability of the project.25 In their diagnosis, both identified darkness and ignorance of the Indian people as the key problem. And the cure, it

was believed, was the removal of this darkness through a systematic dissemination of enlightened Western ideas. The German missionaries thus asserted in the tone of the colonialists the 'need of schools [so] that the rising generation [of tribals] may be saved from sinking into utter bestiality'.26 The tenor of both was that of ethnocentric reformers unsympathetic to tribal culture and language.

Ostensibly both parties were in agreement, but there were differences too, and they were reflected in their approach to change. The colonial state would depend on a set of well-defined laws, whereas the missionaries would repose faith on certain moral tenets drawn from the Gospel. In the domain of education, this implied, in case of the colonial state, priority of Western liberal literary and scientific education, which was applied in the Kishenpur School in a modest way.27 The missionaries' urgency would be the profusion of Christian teaching and moral training, more so when there was special need of consolidating a mass of new converts and of raising local mission workers. Owing to this dual purpose imposed upon the Chhotanagpur missionaries, there was a need to open some centrally located boarding schools, normally of the middle level and a theological institute, besides a chain of village elementary schools. Boarding facility was considered quite desirable for intimate training of prospective staff. Despite differences, the colonial state and the missionaries needed each other in the given situation. Both thus constantly negotiated space for their respective agendas; given such a scenario, intermittent skirmishes were inevitable.28

The presence of an Anglican mission, the SPG, which quickly established itself by adopting a rebel group of GEL missionaries and their followers, seemingly soothed ruffled feathers in both camps. By 1870, the number of primary and midlevel schools in the area—the utterly slow growth of the Kishenpur government school notwithstanding—proliferated into 28, with all save 3 run by missionaries. The tribals, reluctant respondents earlier, now formed the predominant majority of the 1178 students on the rolls.29 The popularity of the missionaries compelled the colonial authorities to concede to the predominance of Christian curricula in the missionary-run schools, although they did not normally approve of the practice. Neither did they approve of the payment of subsidy for students' boarding provision. Yet, Dalton impressed upon the higher authorities that the boarding schooling was actually the most expedient means of 'civilising the tribals of Chhotanagpur'.30

## **Hope and Despair of the Campbell Scheme**

Even though the government-missionary joint venture was apparently making some headway, the authorities were impatient to see greater results. Dalton commenting upon the educational Inspector's report of 1872–73 wrote:

We cannot read these details without being made sensibly alive to the fact that though we have been rather congratulating ourselves on the steady advance we have made within the last dozen years, we are still in a terribly backward state, and have an appalling amount of work to do to obtain a more respectable place in the field.31

In the wake of such anxiety, the authorities seized upon the Campbell scheme as an opportunity for making further strides in education. Despite open appreciation for the missionaries' role, the state chose to act alone in this case. The officials were aware of a growing suspicion among some tribals that missionary schools were actually a trap for conversion and the cultural weaning away of youth from the community. The government schools, the officials proposed, would be real public schools such as the ones in the adjoining tribal district of Singhbhum, attracting both Christian and non-Christian tribals.32

The Campbell scheme basically aimed at the reactivation and reconditioning of the dispersed *pathsalas* (centres of indigenous popular education, a project originally initiated by Lieutenant Governor J.P. Grant in 1860 and abruptly abandoned for lack of funds) as government village schools.33 In regions where no *pathsalas* existed, the authorities directed that 'the bulk of our money and the strength of our energies should be mainly devoted to establishing new schools'.34 Chhotanagpur was one of those exceptional regions where the effort was 'almost entirely confined to carrying out this view'.35 The *pathsalas* there had been of the most primitive kind, being 'parallel with the worst pathsalas of Hazaribagh',36 the improvement of which was not viable. This meant creation of fresh 'vernacular' schools at high cost.

What distinguished the Campbell scheme was the direct role of the state. To oversee the scheme, a special Deputy Inspector was provided for; pending appointment the local officials were asked to execute and supervise the programme.37 One in ad hoc charge was Special Commissioner R.D. Haldar, who took keen interest

despite his hectic primary duty of *bhuinhari* survey.38 The special drive of the government yielded instant results. Barely 6 months after the scheme's inauguration, the Department of Public Instructions reported exultantly:

The great fact of the year [1872–73] is the establishment … of 152 schools with 3,222 pupils on the 31st March 1873. The number of pupils in schools of all kinds is reported as 5,133. Last year the number reported was 1,059, but the statistics of the last year did not include several unaided pathsalas. Giving every allowance for this fact, there is still undoubtedly a vast and most satisfactory increase.39

The project spread to other parts of the district. In 1873, Haldar was 'delighted' to see 'Uraon lads reading and writing with as much alacrity as the Hindu boys' in a 2-month-old school in the village of Khatanga.40 In the Munda area, his pet school was the village Karra School, about which he wrote in 1874 that all students except one were Mundas and that on the day of his visit, 37 out of the total of 42 on the roll attended the classes.41

Seemingly a great success, the scheme contained the seeds of its own undoing. The creation of fresh schools taxed the government heavily. Owing to the requirement of an uninterrupted flow of funds, the schemes' continuity was clouded in uncertainty. An official observed:

The Lieutenant Governor has, out of exceptional savings, made a small provision for primary schools during the present year. But no such savings can be expected in coming years, and there has been no successful step made to meet permanently the difficulty that Bengal has no funds for establishing, aiding and maintaining primary schools for the 65 millions of its subjects.42

Not surprisingly, within 5 years, further progress was arrested. In 1875, the number of government and aided primary schools in Lohardaga and the number of pupils in them were 214 and 5464, respectively; in 1876, the number of schools remained the same, and the number of pupils rose marginally by 145 only.43 Foreseeing the financial crisis, the Deputy Commissioner of the district 'wisely' directed the Deputy Inspector to concentrate on the improvement of existing schools.44

Elsewhere in the province, the government could salvage the scheme either by raising the fee or by reducing cost by concentrating upon only select centres of indigenous instruction. In respect of the Mundas and Uraons, not only was there an absence of such centres, but even the proposition of imposing a fee was problem-

<sup>38</sup>Haldar was appointed Special Commissioner by the Government of Bengal according to the Act of 1869 to survey the *bhuinhari* claims of the Mundas and Uraons. He carried out the survey diligently for 10 years and submitted his report to the government in 1880. Before his Chhotanagpur posting, he was involved in school inspection.

atic. Except a few cases of voluntary payment at the behest of the missionaries, the tribals were generally unwilling or rather too poor to pay for education. Under the Campbell scheme, they were all the more reluctant since they had been assured of free education.45 The other practice of part payment of salary to the *gurus* in the form of gifts, prevalent in neighbouring areas, too was unappealing as the idea was wholly alien to tribal culture.46

The scheme also suffered from the problem of supervision owing to Campbell's sweeping changes in the administrative setup. The education officials, including the Deputy Inspector, were made responsible to the district authority and the district education committee, thus shrouding responsibility in red tape. Apparently, many government functionaries worked in tandem, but as far as real-time application went, the programme was no one's responsibility.47 This was especially true in the case of Chhotanagpur.48 By the time of the Education Commission (1882), all that was left of the Campbell scheme was a set of languishing village schools.

## **Resurgent Christian Missionary Interests**

The contemporary view of government on popular education was that it 'needs and ought to receive, much artificial stimulus and encouragement'.49 According to the education inspector of Lohardaga (1873), this was especially so in respect of tribal societies such as the Mundas and Uraons, 'the class least influenced by education'.50 The 'unusual difficulty' in the tribal context was perceived to be poverty, inaccessibility and the absence of an indigenous system.51 This reaffirmed the need both of a special effort to reach out and of the compulsion of government to rely upon nongovernmental agencies. The Education Commission felt the need of non-governmental involvement 'so great' that 'any agency' under the policy of religious neutrality could be hired for the job with 'absolute freedom in all circumstances'.52 With no other choice save the missionaries, the government was thus compelled to resort to their services once again. Meanwhile, the credibility of the missionaries had grown. Though they suffered something of a setback, especially the GEL Mission on account of the Sardari Larai (1858–1895)—a constitutional movement of the first-generation-educated tribals for their agrarian rights53—they nevertheless

conducted the schools efficiently and took care to train teachers, which needless to say was a 'a great want' in the Campbell schooling scheme.54

The missionary movement itself was in a flux. The SPG vacillated between the ideas of immediate and en bloc conversion, called 'mass movement' in missiology,55 and ideal conversion following sustained instruction and discernible spiritual change in the individual. The presence of the former GEL missionaries, who had pioneered 'mass movement', would tempt them to go in for this, whereas the Protestant ethics of conversion would restrain them. Ultimately, they largely practised the latter, doing 'very little aggressive work'56 and winning few fresh converts. The GEL Mission, on the other hand, attempted to carry forward their earlier advances making use of their tried method, that is, legal help to the tribals in agrarian cases, with the tribals reciprocating by converting in groups. But their effort was dampened by the Sardari Larai,57 which painted GEL missionaries as a spent force for failing to fulfil the escalated aspirations of the tribals.

The situation created a space for fresh missionary leaders which the Jesuits who hardly made any progress in the first 15 years astutely exploited under the leadership of the young and energetic Constant Lievens since 1885.58 Lievens adroitly revived the GEL method of conversion in the changed situation. From a few hundred in 1885, the Jesuits gathered within 5 years over 55,000 tribal converts and some 30,000 catechumens, leaving behind the GEL Mission (1890).59 They won not only fresh converts but were also able to convince groups of adamant Sardars and adherents of the GEL and SPG to come under their fold.60 By the turn of the nineteenth century, the Jesuits became the undisputed missionary leaders of Chhotanagpur, with their 'widespread influence' covering even the government.61

The GEL Mission provided the Jesuits not only a template for conversion but also one for education, that is, 'central schools' (often one each for boys and girls) of middle vernacular level, a seminary for theological training and teachers' training, all at Ranchi—and a string of village schools in the inner mission field. The SPG, who abstained from mass conversion, assigned education a classical evangeli-

In Chhotanagpur, he began conversion work from Jamgain among the Mundas by helping them to fight their agrarian claims in the court. In 1888, after appointment as 'moderator' of the mission field of the district of Lohardaga, he moved to the Uraon region of Barway, where he achieved greater success of conversion. His conversion movement incited strong reaction of the landlords and the police, the exploiters of the tribals. He wrecked his health in missionary work and died young at the age of 37.

cal role propounded and best practised by Calcutta-based Scottish missionary, Alexander Duff in the early nineteenth century.62 In the specific situation of Chhotanagpur, the SPG evangelical education addressed the tribal situation at different stages, from village school to higher levels.63 The GEL-Jesuit model, on the other hand, treated education as purveyor to post-conversion spiritual and manpower needs of a nascent Christian community. Popular education of the elementary kind was its priority, middle school and religious training a necessity and higher education a luxury.

Within 2 years of their existence, the SPG started two middle vernacular schools, both for boys and girls, one with boarding facility and the other for day scholars. This, besides 22 village schools (12 aided, 10 unaided), catered to the needs of a total of 557 students.64 They soon added an evening school, appointed a supervising master of village schools to monitor quality and began training teachers.65 Their 'central' school, St Paul's Ranchi, converted into an English school, became a model institution, much to the envy of other missions. Since boarding schools were considered the best 'centres' of Christian influence,66 they even converted five schools into 'small boarding schools' in the outlying mission field.67 Furthermore, the SPG in recognition of the importance of the press in evangelical pursuit introduced a lithographic press that published a Hindi monthly, *Dut Patrika*.

In contrast, the GEL-Jesuit model stressed upon the consolidation of the huge half-baked mass of converts. From 1870 onwards, the GEL Mission's pointed effort was blurred for some time on account of the Sardari Larai and the Jesuit invasion on their hold. The basic features of their model were, however, well brought out by the Jesuit effort in the late nineteenth century. The Jesuits began with randomly opened village schools as also a 'central' school and novitiate at Ranchi.68 But for years the said schools remained 'very elementary', in the manner of 'catechism schools'. Grosjean, a missionary closely associated with the establishment of the early schools, corroborated this fact,69 and as regards the 'central' St John's School, A. Grignard, the director of the mission, admitted in 1899:

Till last year our Ranchi school did not differ much from any other mission school. It took boys from the surrounding towns and villages and taught them in the same way as the vil-

lage schools did. They learnt to read and write Hindi, both in Nagri and in Roman script. They were taught some arithmetic, and that was all.70

Even when students were admitted from far and wide the mission field, the aim remained 'to train good teachers and catechists'.71 The Jesuits also began some village boarding schools but, unlike the SPG, more with the objective of preparing cadres of grass-roots mission workers locally than for evangelical influence. In short, the Jesuit educational move was determined by the poor quality of converts and their distribution in a sprawling geographical area.72

The Jesuit converts were the product of a mission in terrific haste. Lievens confided to his colleagues: 'I fear the people will fall away from us unless I baptize a great many of them. By doing so I take possession of the country'.73 As Grosjean remarked, the converts were 'more babies than adults',74 and therefore he prescribes the following educational responsibility for the local missionary :

The system of the missionary teaching in the villages would only be practicable for eight villages. There remains therefore according to me but one practicable system, i.e., to get the greatest number of boys and girls in the schools, also to get the young married people and by instructing these properly to them to teach others in their own tollas [sub-villages]. Otherwise a very large number will die without having known anything of Christian religion or Christian life.75

The said conditions made the Protestants mock Jesuits that they 'help the people very much; but they don't teach the children anything'.76

## **Mundane Calls and Missionary Dilemmas**

The phenomenon of missionary 'mass movement' was responsible for the neglect of higher education. The GEL missionaries who pursued large-scale conversion in Biru and Barway parts of Chhotanagpur in the wake of Jesuit advances never initiated higher education beyond the school level. However, under conditions created by the Sardari Larai in 1889, there was talk of opening a college.77 The case of the Jesuits' was even more telling. Although established as a brand name in higher education elsewhere, admirably conducting St Xavier's College, Calcutta (since

1862),78 where ironically the missionary recruits of Chhotanagpur were trained,79 they were the last to act on the matter.

This wilful neglect had its consequences. Immediately after the Sardari Larai, there was equally aggressive anti-British messianic Birsa movement (1895–1900).80 Upon suppression of the movement, the government in 1902 undertook a 'thorough' survey and settlement of agrarian matters of the district. The said settlement was premised on the *bhuinhari* survey conducted earlier. On the basis of preliminary findings, the government officially recognized the special land rights of tribals under the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act, 1908.81 This was followed by several administrative measures: the establishment of a district board at Ranchi and subdivisions at Gumla (1902), Khunti (1905) and Simdega (1915). These steps opened up new avenues for government employment at the doorstep of the tribals. The same opportunities came to be vied for by outsiders too, especially from Bihar and Bengal.82 The government however, for the first time, looked for educated local tribals for appointment, and a few were even employed.83 This indicated to the tribals how education and employment could lead to a better quality of life.84

The missionaries could not ignore this change in the tribal mindset. The SPG, free from the primary liability of consolidating the neo-converts, was the first to gauge this. A note, specially subjoined to the SPG report of 1889, stated:

We must endeavour to give our youths a sound Christian education in the widest sense of the term. This will enable them to fight their own way in the world instead of being hangerson of the Mission to the end of the chapter; and will also present Christianity as civilizing, elevating, and ennobling agency, instead of its being represented merely as a proselytizing one, as is often done in a backward district like Chotanagpore.85

For the idea to reify, the missionaries realized that the system of limiting schooling to the middle level had to go. Without upgrading their schools, the missionaries could well guide their able and ambitious students to join the government Zila

<sup>82</sup>The growth of higher education in Bihar since 1862, when Patna College was started, raised in due course a sizeable group of educated Biharis. They laid claims over the local vacancies and resisted the entrenched Bengali population.

School at Ranchi, a high school since 1875. In fact, the SPG claimed that their St Paul's Ranchi supplied the Zila School its 'best boys'.86

But the government school environment would, it was feared, vitiate the students' Christian make-up. 'The only way to obviate this', the missionaries felt, was to raise their Ranchi 'central' school to the high school standard, 87 but the shortage of missionary hands stood in the way. Soon enough the SPG found a way, that is, collaboration with the Dublin University Mission (DUM), which resulted in the establishment of an English school (1895) and St Columba's College (1899) at Hazaribagh.88 The choice of Hazaribagh perhaps served the dual purpose of allowing the mission to exercise evangelical influence on the non-tribal population along with providing tribal boys an avenue for higher education not far from home.89 Moreover, as a result of intense rivalry among the three missions at Ranchi, even before the SPG could act, the GEL Mission upgraded its middle school as Gossner High School (1896).90 Similar Jesuit and SPG action followed in respect of St John's (1905) and St Paul's (1908), respectively. Therefore, it could be said that at the turn of the nineteenth century, missionary and mundane compulsions resulted in educational developments in Chhotanagpur. These educational inroads, if one were to call them so, originated in the villages, connected them to the moffusils and Ranchi and provided a rudimentary route to ambitious tribals placed in the remotest recesses.91

<sup>87</sup>*Report of the Chotanagpur Mission of the SPG for the year 1894.*

<sup>88</sup>The DUM even joined hands at Ranchi. But the collaboration did not progress as DUM also was afflicted by the deficit of missionaries, *Report of the Chotanagpur Mission of the SPG for the year 1908*.

<sup>89</sup>Though this policy is not clearly stated, individual missionaries, for instance, E.H. Whitley and Eyre Chatterton, were engaged in dialogue with non-tribals or preaching in the market places, Dublin University Mission (1897: 12) and *Report of the Chotanagpur Mission of the SPG for the year 1907*, 3.

With the same idea of addressing the non-tribal mind, later in 1920, the SPG opened European high schools, Westcott School, one each for boys and girls at Ranchi. See Government of Bihar and Orissa (1922). Notes. Education, File No. IV, E—17. The schools came into being after transfer of Calcutta Free School to Ranchi, originally proposed by Lieutenant Governor Andrew Fraser (1905), fizzled out.

<sup>90</sup>Taking cue from SPG, the GEL also started a press and a journal called *Gharbandhu* in 1878 which continues to this day.

<sup>91</sup>An intimate report of the St John's School, Ranchi of 1910 says:

The more promising boys from the bungalow schools in Biru, Barway and Chechari were all sent to Ranchi. The journey to Ranchi was done either fully on foot with some elderly men accompanying them to carry their belongings, or partly on foot, viz. till Lohardaga, from where they took the little train … Such journeys from home to school lasted several days with halts at various mission stations along the road. (Moens 1987: 13)

## **New Missionary Contingencies and the 'School Campaign'**

Missionary education at urban centres in colonial India symbolized elite education. In the local cultural context, even Ranchi schools tended to be so but were restrained constantly by the exigency of mass conversion in a wide area. The missionaries feared new challenges—the presence of Hindu and Islamic missions, the phenomenon of 'heathenism' or apostasy and even socialism that potentially endangered their newly established Christian community.92 They realized that the nineteenth century defensive approach would not suffice for keeping the community intact. This activated a humanitarian action of constructive measures to ameliorate the dismal social condition of the converts. This found expression, in the Protestants' case, in their national and international conferences and a number of programmes of uplift of the 'mass movement' converts.93

In case of the outcast converts, the measures were hurdled by casteism in the church.94 The tribals' case, which was free from the factor of upper caste Christians, was however faced with the racist idea of tribe, propped by colonial ethnology and from which the missionaries were not free. A common missionary understanding of 'tribe' in case of the Mundas and Uraons, as noted by a perceptive Jesuit, was 'a set of drunkards and liars … [who] do not deserve any education at all', rather merited to be left 'in the bliss of their primitive simplicity'.95 The advanced Darwinism of the time widely fixed this idea in the Western missionary mind.96

The Jesuits, led by J.B. Hoffmann, an old champion of the *bhuinhari* rights of the Mundas and Uraons and an incognito architect of the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act, sought to rectify the prejudices and initiated a plan for tribal welfare.97 The GEL

J. Hoffmann, *Encyclopaedia Mundarica*, Vol. IV: 1117. (For details on the *Encyclopaedia* volumes, see next footnote.)

<sup>97</sup>Father John Baptist Hoffmann (1857–1928) was a German Jesuit in the Bengal mission. He rose above his missionary avocation to help the tribals in their agrarian crisis. He studied the Munda land system and culture deeply in course of his missionary work. In 1908, he helped the government to draft the Chotanagpur Tenancy Act by co-authoring a note entitled 'Special Memorandum on the Land System of the Munda Country', which was appended to the act. Being a German, he was repatriated to Germany during the First World War. He carried the large data he collected on the Chhotanagpur tribals to Germany and, helped by Arthur Van Emelen, composed 13 volumes of *Encyclopaedia Mundarica*, which were published by the government of Bihar (I–XI, 1930–37; XII–XIII, 1950). For details on his life and involvements, see Tete (1986).

Mission and the SPG had no such local introspection but were touched by the Protestant national programme of rural development and cooperatives.98

In this environment, the subject of education received considerable impetus. The SPG, in 1908, was candid enough to admit: 'No work can exceed in importance the training of the young … We can only justify our reception of these simple people into the fold of Christ's church by our careful education and training of them after admission'.99 The annual *panchayat* of the GEL Mission discussed ways to strengthen the village school system. The Protestant effort was, however, hurdled by receding supply of missionary personnel, especially after the outbreak of the First World War.100 The Jesuits, under the stewardship of Hoffmann, emerged the most aggressive of the lot post in 1909. They formed a cooperative credit society aimed at the 'development of a spirit of self-reliance, self-help and productive resourcefulness in the tribals'.101 The idea of development led to a 'school campaign'102 to create a network of village schools.103 The Jesuit drive increased the number of students in just 1 year in 1913 by 112%.104 After village schools became operational in the interiors, steps were taken to link them with the Ranchi central school by opening nine sub-central middle schools by1928.105

The progress of this phase put Chhotanagpur distinctively on the educational map of Catholic India.106 But the growth was flattened at the level of middle vernacular schools, 107 leaving the pre-1910 progress stagnant. Ignoring the tribals' aspiration for higher English education, the mission authorities reiterated that 'a solid vernacular training' was preferable to a 'smattering of English'.108 A second Jesuit high school came into being (at Simdega) only in 1930, and the subject of college education was never considered seriously.109 The gesture of financial support to needy and able aspirants also came quite late, in 1923, and that too as a

## **The Government Mind and Measures**

Meanwhile, the missionaries ministering education to the tribals made the colonial state complacent, especially so when the mission schools began catering to nontribals as well.111 In 1914, the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Charles Bayley, while inaugurating the new building of St John's Ranchi, specially complimented the missionaries for admitting a good number of non-tribals.112 The government, therefore, provided missionaries with liberal aids113 and recognized their experience and expertise in the education of the tribals.114 It, however, did not sacrifice its colonial object at the altar of missionary interest. It still exercised control over the missionaries through the regime of inspection. This was manifest in the manner in which the Education Commission, 1882, recommended special allowances to the government for the tribal populations who had 'not adopted the civilizations or creeds of the higher races'.115

In Chhotanagpur, the authorities though undaunted or not alarmed by the incidence of the Sardari Larai, where the tribals employed skills obtained from elementary education in the constitutional assertion for their rights, they did not appreciate the tribals' disciplined action as a step towards 'civilization'. The tribal militancy under the movement was instead seen as an ugly sign of the inveterate backwardness of the tribal mind; the tribal image was thus perpetuated as primitive and savage, needing much more corrective measures by way of education.116

This reinforcement of the agenda of tribal 'civilization' did not however prompt any appropriate government measures for their intellectual growth. The government

<sup>113</sup> In 1913, the Ranchi District Board helped the Jesuits to establish 60 new village schools.

was content with the lone Zila High School for decades. Even there, the hardships of the tribal students, cultural and economic, were never cared for, whereas the interest of the *zamindar* class was especially attended to by opening a special hostel for them through public subscription (1907).117 The authorities were equally callous about the tribals' need for college education. A 'Ranchi College Scheme' was mooted by the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, Andrew Fraser, in 1904 when he visited Ranchi.118 But this was to be an elite institution, meant for the children of 'Indian parents occupying high positions of influence in the interiors, such as land holders, lawyers, judges, district officers and men of business'.119 The attraction of Ranchi was owing to it being as a 'healthy place in the whole of Bengal'.120, 121 The scheme failed to take off; but the idea indicated that tribal interests were non-existent in the British mind.

The government's indifference to the tribals' needs of higher education was further highlighted in the episode of the Patna University Bill (1913). Ranchi was disqualified for a college, since according to clause 9 (3) of the bill, the territorial jurisdiction of the university was confined to only four towns of Bihar, which already had a college. In south Bihar, Hazaribagh qualified for this, and the government presumed that Hazaribagh being only 58 miles away from Ranchi was convenient for the tribals; and furthermore, the enterprising among them could even proceed to Patna. It failed to realize that Hazaribagh was 'not a real aboriginal and Christian centre' and that St Columba's College there was a Protestant institution, which, in the given interdenominational prejudices, the Catholic adherents would avoid.122 And Patna, hundreds of miles away and harbouring 'strong inborn prejudices' against the tribals, would be a still more unlikely a choice for the homeloving tribal boy.123 This made some venture to join Ravenshaw College at Cuttack, which being equally alien led to a lot of difficulty for them.124

Ranchi, on the other hand, as observed by a conscientious official, was ideally suited to the tribals:

In Ranchi there are 197,000 Christians and 526,000 Animists or a total of 723,000 out of a population of 1,334,000. More than half of the population is thus definitely aboriginal, while there are 197,000 Christians in this district out of a total of 257,000 in the whole Province … The aboriginal population is thus very much concentrated around Ranchi and … as a special case an intermediate institution should be opened for them at Ranchi ...125

The government sidetracked the core issue, denied the claim of Ranchi during the debate on the Bill and tried to appease the tribals by offering a few scholarships.126 Political pressure, spearheaded by S.C. Roy, member of the Bihar and Orissa Legislative Council and a friend of the Mundas and Uraons, however, forced the establishment of an Intermediate college (1926) in the town.127 The classes were to be experimental for 3 years and, if successful, upgraded to the graduation level. This, however, took 20 years.128 The government justified the delay by underplaying tribal aspirations129 and even tried to evade the responsibility by suggesting that the missionaries raise one of their Ranchi 'central' schools to college level.130

The government actually became a tool of the internal colonial forces. The priority of the Bihar elite was the development of higher education in north Bihar. The CUS, the watchdog of tribal interest, interpreted the mindset of the government before the Indian Statutory Commission thus:

[T]he government did not think fit to grant even that modest demand, although lacs and lacs of rupees are being lavished over Colleges at Patna where (in the Science College)provision has been made very much in excess of the demand. In Chotanagpur, on the other hand, a travesty of an I.A. College has been set up without a building of its own and without sufficient choice of optional subjects suited to the capacities of aboriginal students … For want of proper optional subjects … most aboriginal students cannot take their admission …131

Swami Sahajanand, Bihar peasant leader, was, at a later date (1941) when on a visit of Chhotanagpur, even more outspoken:

<sup>125</sup>Note of B.A Collins dated 13 June 1925, in Government of Bihar and Orissa. Education Department, Education, File No. III—40, 1926, 12.

<sup>126</sup>For instance, when two tribals passed the B.A. examination in 1913, the authorities proposed two scholarships for them on the model of what already existed for the 'Biharis' and 'Oriyas'. In 1925 when the beginning of Intermediate classes was procrastinated, the government offered to compensate the aspirants by a scholarship of 6 rupees. See 'Notes', Government of Bihar and Orissa.

Was it not the duty of government to establish colleges at Jamshedpur, Hazaribagh and Ranchi? For the last twenty years or more; the education Secretary of Bihar has been an Indian. What has been done to educate the voiceless peasants of Jharkhand during this time?132

Owing to the lack of government support and encouragement, even the lone college of the region, St Columba's Hazaribagh, languished, though its presence was always used as a bulwark to deny Ranchi's claim.133

The slant of internal educational colonialism in the region was all-pervasive. On school education Sahajanand observed:

As compared to Bihar, the population of Jharkhand is between one-half and one-third that of the rest of the province. But except the number of lower primary schools here which is one-third of the former, the number of high, middle and upper primary schools in Jharkhand is only one-fourth as compared to Biharkhand [meaning north Bihar]. The number of high schools here is even less than one-fourth the number in Bihar!134

A firm political will was the need of the hour to break the stalemate which, however, was impossible under the prevailing colonial mindset. In 1902, F.A. Slacke, Commissioner, Chhotanagpur, opined that effort of imparting higher education to 'the aborigines *as a body*' was a 'hopeless' task; all that could be done was to train the tribals 'to become efficient carpenters and mechanics and blacksmiths'.135 Three decades later, an honest headmaster-educator found himself surrounded by educational officials who 'conceive[d] the aboriginals as *a set of brainless idiots* not prone to education'.136

## **The Tribal Attitude and Awareness**

Between mid-nineteenth century and the early twentieth century, the Mundas and Uraons moved a long way from being reluctant recipients of colonial education. The tribals began responding calculatingly and accepting the system selectively. The component of document reading particularly appealed to them,137 since it helped in

deciphering the mischief of penmanship associated with landlordism.138 From this, soon education became an expedient means to claim and protect tribal agrarian rights, which the petitions to the government and other related activities of the Sardari Larai reflected well since 1867. The idea of education being a means for new livelihood and increased social status also developed, though rather modestly.139

The tribal valorisation of education, however, continued, thanks mainly to their employment in the expanding church establishments on the basis of limited education. The tribal students packing the classrooms of the missionary schools, many clinging to classes despite several failures as repeaters and their sprinkling presence in the government school, were indicative of it. Their interest, however, did not result in any proactive initiative on their part to develop the system, as found in the rural Bengal mainland. Apart from their economic handicaps and slow attitudinal change, the active role of the missionaries repelled this. Yet, in the early stage, when nudged by the missionaries, the tribals did come forward to contribute to the founding schools.140 Interestingly, when a section of the neo-converts revolted against the missionaries under the banner of the Sardari Larai, one of their first tasks was to set up schools parallel to the church institutions.141

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the tribal mindset changed dramatically. The same events that stirred new missionary educational thinking impinged upon the tribal mind as well. The failure of the Sardari Larai and suppression of the Birsa movement had left the tribal masses in despair. The tribals realized that combative confrontation with the authorities was futile. Further, the agrarian measures of the government assured them that the agrarian question was now a settled matter. The tribals also observed educated outsiders swarming Chhotanagpur, wresting away local white-collar jobs and enjoying good living and social status. These developments opened the eyes of many to a future beyond land and agriculture, in education, employment and community development.142 For this to materialize, knowledge of English and higher education were considered crucial.

Such awareness was noticeable first among the Protestant tribals. In 1894, a 'native clergy' was found starting in his village 'a preparatory boarding school' with students being self-supported, a move 'impossible a few years back'.143 In the GEL Mission, at the annual conference of 1906, the tribal representatives not only underlined the need of education for maximum numbers but also highlighted the urgency

of the neglected area of girls' education.144 The Roman Catholic followers, generally used to missionary tutelage, were also drawn into the tide. At a large *panchayat* under the auspices of the church, held in March 1913, they 'vehemently affirmed' their desire for village schools and expressed their readiness to contribute towards the pay of the teachers.145 The adherents also acknowledged the importance of English 'as a sure means to secure future progress and welfare'146 and further pressed for, what their GEL counterparts had already done,147 conversion of the recently opened vernacular middle schools into English middle schools or alternatively an addition to those of an English section.148 There was also a discernible desire for upward educational mobility despite extreme poverty.149 The size of those coming to Ranchi rose despite escalated educational and maintenance costs.150

The educational yearning of the tribals for higher education was also apparent. The SPG reported in 1894 that every year of the students passing out of their English middle school, a certain number aspired for university education.151 A cry for college education rose, which by 1903 led to the organization of three funds—the Vidya Vriddhi Sabha, Self-Supporting Fund and Young Charitable Fund—among the Protestants for financing higher education of the youth. 152 The non-Christian tribals, more backwards than the Christians, also floated an association, the Chotanagpur Uraon–Munda Siksha Sabha (1904). The objective was to open new institutions, hostels and libraries and support deserving students in higher education.153 The Sabha's aim in the words below envisaged progress as:

To promote the moral welfare of the Mundas and Oraons of Chotanagpur, by inculcating habits of thrift, sobriety, respect for law and authority, and other virtues, and by instruction, advice and admonition to wean them from belief in witchcraft and other superstitious beliefs, habits and practices which often lead to disastrous consequences.154

## **Advancing Against Adversities**

In the last half century, the colonial state hardly addressed the cultural handicaps of the tribals—their unfamiliarity with the written and literary tradition, alien language and as such with the formal system of education.156 The students at the Ranchi schools, on the other hand, were provided for by the newly established village and satellite middle schools from the remotest places.157 The tribal students were, thus, put to hard struggle at Ranchi. A principal sensitive to the tribals' problems observed:

[The] boys who seemed to have great facilities for study in the lower classes are unable to go up to the matriculation … I should observe that the aboriginal boys are labouring under greater difficulties than the others and that the task required from them is disproportionately heavy. The reason is that they have to learn one language more than the others as Hindi is not their native language and before going to school they practically know nothing of it. This is a very serious handicap, all the more that a sound grounding in the vernacular is supposed to be the basis of further education. Now they have scarcely mastered the elements of Hindi when they must begin English and they are scarcely initiated to the elements of the English language when a serious study of a classical language is demanded from them. The inevitable result is that they cannot be proficient in any of the three languages which claim their attention. If at least they could so apply themselves to their three languages as to be able to give them a sufficient part of their time, but mathematics, history, geography, science, hygiene, drawing and drill require a good amount of their time also, and thus such a burden is imposed upon their brains that they give way under it and that many of those overtasked students in spite of their most extraordinary goodwill and docility come to no appreciable results.158

The system continued to be stiff, exacting large casualty. At St John's Ranchi between 1909 and 1921, for instance, of the 190 tribal students in ninth class, only

<sup>156</sup>Against nineteenth-century craze for English and readiness to pay for it elsewhere, the colonialists claimed to have made two special concessions for the tribals: buying attendance by penny payment (sarcastically termed 'bribery') and opening a vernacular (Hindi) section. Both were actually fringe concessions. The tribal cultural resources and languages were considered 'barren' for educational use by both the colonialists and the missionaries. The missionaries developed the tribal languages by writing down dictionaries and grammars. However, this and whatever other literature they developed were primarily geared to missionary purposes. Under the Campbell scheme, steps were taken to use tribal language among the neighbouring Santhal tribe, which were however halfheartedly implemented.

Among the Mundas and Uraons, the first attempt to employ the Mundari and Kurux (Uraon) by the government was made only in the early twentieth century. The effort lacked seriousness. 157GEL Mission 1908: 26; Moens 1987: 13.

66 (34.7%) were sent up for matriculation examination, and, ultimately, only 51 (26.3%) passed; 124 actually dropped out between eighth class and matriculation.159 The achievements of the Gossner High School (GEL) and of St Paul's were slightly better but in no way encouraging. At the former, for instance, in 1926, out of 20 examinees, only 8 or 9 passed, of which 3 or 4 could be non-tribals.160 The great majority of the aspirants ended up as middle level educated and were employed as village school teachers and lower functionaries in the missions or government. Those who passed the matriculation had to face a tougher path ahead. Only a few could enter college. For instance, from St John's Ranchi between 1909 and 1925, out of 37 matriculates who opted for secular careers,161 only 18 joined college. Of these, barely 5 passed B.A. or comparable professional degrees or diplomas.162 The case of the Gossner School students was similar in 12 years; since the inception of high school teaching, only 13 tribals could clear the entrance examination of the Calcutta University.163 In the SPG, in 1910, the authorities of St Columba's Hazaribagh were left with the measly presence of 12 'Christian' boys, probably all tribals.164

The squeezed entry of the Munda and Uraon youth in the college education was not because of any substandard education in the Ranchi schools, if the annual inspector's reports were to be believed. Financial insecurity and hostile cultural environment appeared to be the students' common obstacle. In a rare autobiographical life sketch, Herman Lakra, one of the early graduates, narrates how he managed to join college against the wishes of his illiterate father by stealing money from his grandfather and was later able to pass B.A. with the support of the college principal; he also describes how he was regularly humiliated as 'Kol' by the non-tribal majority.165 At the end of the ordeal, however, the select few graduates or postgraduates were hardly assured of any career. The horde of migrant graduates from Bihar, advantaged by the growing political clout of the Bihar elite, captured the vacancies in the region. Only at the intervention of some benevolent European officials, a few lucky locals could get some crumbs.166

Despite all of this, the tribals motivated by the desire for a better life were not disheartened. The enlightened members organized a pan-tribal association, initially

Chotanagpore Charitable Association (CCA) (1912)167 and then Chota-Nagpur Unnati Samaj (CUS) (1915). The Samaj was supposedly the tribals' 'national' platform.168 Though the Catholic Church officially boycotted it and formed its own *'unnati samaj'*, some individual Catholics joined the former.169 The word '*unnati*' signified widespread 'quest for progress', wherein education had a pivotal place.170 'It will be the highest benefit to get our boys educated; all of us, rich and poor, have this one wish' was how the Samaj members put forth its objective at its general meeting of 1925.171 The members were concerned that the CUS leadership was not doing enough on the subject.172

The tribal intellectual leaders prioritized the area of higher education in their agenda of progress. Since college education was unaffordable to aspiring tribal students, one of the first tasks of the leaders was to extract scholarships from the government. In 1918, the CUS successfully contested the claim of state scholarship hitherto held by a non-tribal for Joel Lakra (later a prominent member of the CUS) for his college study at Calcutta.173 The success encouraged a scholarship campaign.174 The tribal movement for the Ranchi College was the outcome of a longstanding 'dogged effort';175 and once the Intermediate class was operational, they followed up its upgrading. Besides pleading with the Indian Statutory Commission and passing a resolution in this respect,176 the CUS made representation to the Governor of Bihar and Orissa. It stated that the organization suffered 'great disappointment' that despite 3 years of 'eminently successful' working of the Intermediate class, a degree college at Ranchi was elusive.177

Indifference of the government led the tribals to see the root cause in the state of internal colonialism. They, therefore, wanted a separate board consisting of tribal members 'to conduct and look after the education of the aborigines' and to do away with non-tribal inspecting officers.178 The tribals further sought representation in bodies such as the Patna University senate and textbook committee.179 The tribals further took up the related cause of employment, asserting that as 'real natives' of the soil they formed 'special cases' for 'special treatment' in government employment.180 They were especially piqued over discrimination practised in the appointment to executive posts of the province.181

Special interest in higher education employment and share in educational management of the tribal intelligentsia was not exceptional in the colonial context182 nor was it middle class myopia. The tribal intelligentsia was the spearhead of tribal development, attempting to address the broader problems of tribal society in the quest for community progress. The CUS, thus, petitioned the government, through the Indian Statutory Commission, for 'compulsory' primary education in the medium of spoken language of the tribal masses and especially pointed out the cultural constraints inherent in the colonial system:

Little heed is paid to the growth of education in this part of the province. The authorities seem to forget that that the aboriginals are unlike their neighbours who have a civilization of thousands of years behind them … The kind of education afforded to the Bengalis, Biharis and Oriyas is unsuitable for the aborigines of Chotanagpur. Consequently the education that is now provided is of little practical utility to an aboriginal and this may account for the apathy which is at present shown to education by an aboriginal.183

While suggesting the essence of tribal culture, the leaders, however, failed to spell out the details.

## **Conclusion**

The tribes of India living on the fringes of society were the last to be connected to the British colonial educational policy. This sets them out as the educational opposite of the population at colonial metropolitan centres of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. The colonial concept of 'tribe' showcasing the tribals more in need of 'civilization' through Western education than others sprouted local schemes in various regions under the care of local European officials. 'Personal' interest of the European

officials and later, in many cases, transfer of responsibility to the 'friendly' Christian missionaries, professedly the 'right' educators of the tribals, created the impression that the British were earnest about educating the tribals. While in actuality, the policy was heavily dictated by colonial and missionary agendas resulting in stunted structure, with a virtual vacuum in terms of higher education in the tribal areas till the time of independence.184

Colonial education appealed to the tribals for varying reasons at different stages. The case of the Mundas and Uraons shows that unlike the general populations who clamoured for respectable employment and social status almost from the beginning, the tribals were drawn to it slowly, first as a means to fight landlordism and later as a means to a better quality of life. The Christian missionaries were catalytic to the tribals' response but were not, unlike the colonialists' contention, the 'only' or the 'most appropriate' agency to educate the tribals, especially not so from the tribal point of view. The projection was actually a ploy on the part of the colonial state to evade responsibility. The colonial dependency led to the grant of a lot of leeway to the missionaries, and that proved against the tribals' interest.

Both the government and the missionaries were insensitive to the tribals' cultural handicaps, which exacted a heavy price in terms of dropout rate.185 The students continuing in class as repeaters depicted both the tribals' aspiration for and their perseverance with colonial education, whereas from the colonial point of view, guided by the fixed idea of tribe, it was significant of 'failure' because of the 'backward' state of the tribal mind.186 The tribals' valorization of colonial Western education and aspiration for it inspired them to promote the system, which, however, was stymied by the tribals' deep poverty and the presence of missionary enterprise. The interest was evident in the early twentieth century when the first generation tribal intelligentsia specially took up the educational cause in their struggle against internal colonialism.187

After 1930, when the nationalists led by Mahatma Gandhi thought of 'educational reconstruction', the small tribal intelligentsia of Chhotanagpur brought forth evils of colonial education from the tribal point of view.188 The intelligentsia,

<sup>184</sup>Even in North-east India, where educational development at the hands of the Christian missionaries was faster than other tribal regions, the first college, St Edmond's Shillong, was established only in 1924. The college took over a decade to become a graduate level institution in 1936.

<sup>185</sup> In 1927, for instance, out of 91,000 pupils in class one in Chhotanagpur, 61% were repeaters, 34% for 2 years and 27% for more than 2 years; see Government of Bihar and Orissa. Quinquennial Report on Public Instruction for 1922–27.

<sup>186</sup>This remains a problem in post-independence India's approach to tribal education, since the colonial idea of tribe greatly continues in public discourse.

<sup>187</sup>The reincarnation of CUS, the Adivasi Sabha, phrased a slogan 'Give us education! Give us College!' in 1939 and the Jharkhand Party (born out of the latter Sabha) in its election manifesto of 1951 voiced for a 'residential and teaching university' at Ranchi, *Adivasi* (Mahasabha special issue), March 1939, 16; also see Kujur. n.d. Jharkhand Dumuhane Par, 86.

<sup>188</sup>Since the colonial system uprooted the educated culturally and alienated them from the society, the tribals popularly perceived that the educated actually did not learn but were perished (or *padhlak nahin podlak*). Also see Bara 2005. 'Seeds of Mistrust', for the gap between tribal and colonial perspectives of education.

however, also noted others reaping the benefit of middle class status resulting from the British colonial education and using it as a path to power in the existing polity. Thus, when the Gandhian concept of 'basic' education—addressing especially rural India—was nationally approved (1937) and was adopted by the government, the tribal intelligentsia remained neutral. Some even claimed that basic education meant 'beseekh' or un-education of the tribals.189 As an alternative, in 1940, a tribal cultural leader devised the idea of 'Dhumkuria School', which sought to make use of the tribal cultural edifice and language for a tribal-friendly Western education.190

The 'Dhumkuria' concept was sponsored by tribal autonomy movement in the following years;191 but it lacked wider moral and financial support. The managers of the school begged for help from authorities, which was not forthcoming, since the idea was not appreciated.192 The school exists even today, in most dilapidated condition at the same site where it was started, signifying mutely the inadequacy of nationalist thinking on tribal education. The post-independence educational development showed the nationalist 'basic schools' and 'ashram schools' (conducted by the Adimjati Seva Mandal on behalf of the government) mushrooming in the central Indian tribal belt, in many cases where church schools already existed. The era also witnessed education being employed as an agent of 'civilization' of the 'primitive' and 'backward Hindu' tribals and their 'integration' in the 'national mainstream'.193 Such replay of the colonial idea and approach has left a cesspool of educational woes for tribal India. Not surprisingly, today the tribes of India comprise the largest rejects of Indian education from top to bottom.
