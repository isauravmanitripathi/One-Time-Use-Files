### **Amrendra Kumar Thakur**

**Abstract** The paper makes a critical study of colonial writings on history of Northeast India; identifies inherent bias and prejudices, questions their reliability and validity at the backdrop of political and epistemological crisis that had gone into the creation and argues in favour of interdisciplinary approaches in the process of reconstructing the past history of the Northeast societies; which are predominantly pre-literate and do not have any written tradition. The paper examines the role of colonial ethnographical accounts; discounts projection of tribes as cultural isolates and suggests reconstructing the history in terms of shared past and shared culture; economic dependence; and precisely in the framework of interaction. The paper advocates for historical analysis of the socio-economic life; political and cultural developments on the basis of social science principles and universalism based upon the parameters of causes and effects.

In one of the papers that I published earlier on the theme of the historiography of northeast India, I had tried to suggest that the impact of colonial writings about the tribes of northeast India has continued to be felt even during the postcolonial/postindependence period. This impact was of such force that amnesia was created about the history of the society, economy and the polity of the precolonial period of the region. Consequently, precolonial sociopolitical and economic formations in northeast India did not receive serious attention in research. The condition of the study of the marginalized slaves, the bonded labourers and other such type of labourers in the society whose hard work went into its material (and other) foundations is also not at all encouraging (Thakur 2007:93–120).1

The colonial discourse on tribes in northeast India can be defined largely not only in terms of official colonial writings but also in terms of colonial ethnographic works. However, the recurrent and apparently the most relied upon source of information for the colonial state apparatus about this tribal territory was the detailed descriptive account of visits and tours of colonial officials among the tribes, most of which were written in an ethnographic style and claimed to offer an accurate and detailed knowledge of these territories. The fundamental nature of these supposedly accurate ethnographic writings is manifested ultimately in the representation of the tribes of northeast India as primitive, barbarous, savage, wild-men, head-hunting, opium-eating, etc. and as those who lived as 'cultural isolates in terra incognita'. To the European eyes of these ethnographers, tribal people of northeast India were nothing but queer and exotic. Since the West's 'knowledge' of the East cannot be fully appreciated without identifying the political context within which the East becomes an object of that knowledge, the colonial construction of the tribes as isolated from other tribes and of their social processes as static have to be viewed within the broader context of the colonial state's search for establishing an order and legitimacy for itself and in its attempts to locate its 'strange' within a familiar and hence comforting frame of reference.

The conceptual framework developed by the British administrators-turned-local historians and ethnographers and by colonial anthropologists overlooked the operation of the historical process that led to the formation, maturity and ultimate subversion of various socioeconomic and politico-judicial institutions in colonial northeast India. This was so because the colonial ethnographic perspective 'anthropologized' precolonial sociopolitical structures and institutions by rendering them as mere 'objects' of analysis. It is evident that the colonial portrayal of tribes as 'noble savages', 'cultural isolates' and 'innocent of the operations of the historical processes' on the one hand and the destruction and neglect of the study of the institutions detrimental/in opposition to colonial rule on the other hand led to the construction of a certain myth that has bedevilled most of the early historical writings on the Indian northeastern region. It is from the perspective of the critical reading of the said double bind that marks colonial ethnographic accounts of northeast India that the present paper has been prepared. The paper consists of two parts. The first part deals with the beginning and development of ethnography in India, and in the second part of the paper, the case of northeast India is discussed in particular detail.

It is important to mention in the context underlined above that some other scholars have also worked on this theme of ethnographic accounts of northeast India, and I have greatly benefitted from their writings2 (for details, see Das 1991; Dutta 1996; Goswami

The first seminar of its kind, it attempted to 'take stock of existing knowledge to identify further areas of research and inquiry. It brought together geographers, geologists, ecologists, linguists, historians, anthropologists and archaeologists to explore various facets of the problem.

## **Beginning and Developmen of Ethnography in India**

The colonial state in India witnessed several major transformations in the post-18574 period or, roughly, in the second half of the nineteenth century. Prior to 1857, revenue was mainly generated and collected from land resources, and the authority of the East India Company in this regard was crucial. In the second half of the nineteenth century, major economic transformations took place. These included investment in imperial power – joint stock arrangement, the building of railways and roads, development in refining oil and coal mining and commercialization of garden and farm products such as tea, coffee, etc. Along with the tax collected from the land, trade in these commodities thus became the source of income of the Empire and consequently, the mercantile nature of the Empire consolidated substantially5 (Pantham 1995:70–71). The British then checked their policy of absorption of new lands and sought to strengthen their policy of indirect rule (Thakur 2016). Quite naturally, similar changes were also witnessed in the areas with majority tribal populations. Stricter forest laws, for instance, were introduced in these areas that severely curtailed the various activities such as food gathering, hunting, etc. of the tribes (See Gadgil and Guha 1992 and Thakur 2009). In this changed political and economic condition of the tribes of northeast India, almost as a parallel corollary, a great change having an everlasting impact on academic studies also took place. In the words of Nicholas Dirks, this was the moment when '…after 1857, anthropology supplanted history as the principal colonial modality of knowledge and rule6 (Dirk 2001:43)'. Thus, in the second half of the nineteenth century, writing ethnographic accounts rather than historical study became the order of the day in India.

Unlike in the first half of the nineteenth century when India's 'feudal' past and its village communities were the concern of colonial studies of India, the questions of tribes and castes – their formation, function, beliefs, rituals, etc. – came to occupy

Surprising enough, Arunachal Pradesh and some other regions have not been properly represented. The aspects of ethnoarchaeology and industrial archaeology to mention a few are problematic sides to be found in Thakur (2004) that has attempted at filling this gap.

<sup>3</sup>The Sect. 4.1 of the present paper draws heavily on my Aizawl paper (Thakur 2015).

<sup>4</sup> 1857 marks the year of the occurrence of the first major revolt against the rule of the English in India. The British Company officials, however, had managed to counter and ultimately arrest the revolt.

<sup>5</sup>Pantham's account is indeed crucial as it provides the theoretical framework through which the present paper has sought to establish a linkage between imperialist expansion and systems of knowledge formation established to consolidate colonial rule.

their imagination, especially since 1870. The primary objective of the colonial officials and historians studying tribe and caste in India was to understand their social standing and functioning. The Britishers now wanted to know about India's sociocultural make-up, not just its political economy. Consequently, the discipline of colonial ethnology became prominent and began to replace the subject of colonial history from its position of privilege. A general belief emerged that India could be ruled using anthropological knowledge which could be used to understand and control its populations and to legitimize and consolidate colonial rule in India.

Unsurprisingly, colonial ethnographical studies in India ultimately proved to be a garb to hide the evil machinations of the colonial mission. In such studies, the tribes were described as primitive, barbarous, criminal and naked. Crucial sociological features of the tribal societies of northeast India such as well-formed political and economic institutions to administer laws, conduct social and private ceremonies and impose punishments were neglected. Their largely localized and fixed migration patterns and settlements were highlighted to show them as cultural isolates with no economic, political or trade links with other societies.7 Such studies ignored the multiple ways in which the various tribal societies of northeast India depended on each other and maintained socioeconomic and political relations with each other (see Thakur 2007, 2006; Nag 2011 and Dutta 2013).

It is quite natural then that such early ethnographers, with few exceptions, reduced their tribal 'subjects' to functions and saw them as static 'specimens' without any dynamic vitality (McGlynn 1994).8 Their studies are therefore often easily criticized for their lack of understanding of dynamic social systems. Contrary to the method that they adopted, Frank McGlynn, in a different context, has suggested that the key to acquiring appropriate ethnographic reporting that conveys the sense of structure versus chaos, norm versus ambiguity and order versus contradiction which constitutes culture is through the relationship with key informants modulated in a balance manner (ibid.:319–320). Though McGlynn does not mention the role of the kind of training that the ethnographer receives and the critical method that he/she adopts, these factors are also quite important in making an attempt towards a justifiable ethnographic study of a tribe. Researchers often tend to inherit their own biases on account of the lack of a rigorous, objective training. The writings of Haimendorf

<sup>7</sup>Without commenting on the accuracy (or the lack of it) of data and its analysis presented in these ethnographic accounts here, I must give the names of some of the major studies. These, among others, include Alexander Mackenzie's *History of the Relations of the Government with the Hill Tribes of the North-East Frontier of Bengal* (1884), T. C. Hudson's *The Meitheis* (1908), J.H. Hutton's *The Angami Nagas* (1921a) and *The Sema Nagas* (1921b) and L.W. Shakespeare's *History of the Assam Rifles* (1929).

*It is important to make a related point here. The specific and significant changes brought by the colonial rule in northeast India warrant a special kind of periodization. It seems to me that the periodization of the hill societies of northeast India including Arunachal Pradesh should be on the terms of the pre-colonial, colonial and post-independence rather than the more conventional (and inappropriate in this context) ancient, medieval and modern.* For details, see *Thakur (*2014*).*

<sup>8</sup> I draw this rather obvious insight about the way in which ill-informed ethnographic studies can be academically reductive from Frank McGlynn (1994).

related to Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland, for instance, are great examples of the same lack of balance and objectivity.9

As suggested earlier in this essay, the colonial government was concerned to find ways and means that could produce useful and uniform knowledge about the whole of India since the second half of the nineteenth century. W.W. Hunter, in 1869, was appointed Director General of Statistics to the Government of India in order to facilitate the fulfilment of this aim. Consequently, a series of gazetteers and statistical accounts, on lines dictated by politico-economic concerns of the Empire, were prepared and published about India and Indians. CD Mackan's *General Manual of the Madras Presidency* (1885), for instance, is a fine example of the manner in which ethnographical studies in India became standardized and methodical. Unsurprisingly, Mackan in *General Manual of the Madras Presidency* works with five broad separate subjects: (i) race or descent, (ii) language, (iii) caste, (iv) religion or sect and (v) traditional habits and customs.

Anthropologists and ethnographers, mainly from Great Britain, France and the USA, were visiting India and the colonized world of southeast Asia during the nineteenth century, and they wrote according to their own training and approaches. Typically, British accounts saw the northeastern region of India as composed of several mutually disconnected hill-islands whose borders were actually the ones determined by imperial rule. The French anthropologists studied caste in colonial India. Such anthropologists started the journal *Village India* to have a 'better' understanding of the working of colonial rural India. Christian missionaries also contributed to this task of colonial knowledge formation by classification of tribes and castes in India. The work of Rev. M.A. Sherring, i.e. *Hindu Tribes and Castes* (1872) in three volumes, for instance, is crucial in this regard as it seeks to establish a bridge between Orientalist and empirical forms of knowledge in colonial India. Sherring's volumes seem like a prelude to the census reports that today we all are familiar with. They definitely helped shape the first all-India version (1871–1872) that dealt with the subject of the study of castes and tribes.

## **Northeast India**

The histories in the nineteenth century in India were written mainly by the British administrators who were anxious to know about the land and the people of the country under their control. They followed the maxim that if one wanted to govern a people, one must know about them. Though Assam caught their attention first as an area that needed intervention in terms of history writing, they understood that the land and the people of the neighbouring hills could not be neglected for long. Various exclusive reports and accounts were also prepared and published during the period, usually as some kind of an addendum to the task of historical reconstruction.

<sup>9</sup>For a critical reading of Haimendorf's writings, see Furer-Haimendorf 1939a, b and Thakur 2005.

The field of historiography was also joined by the Christian missionaries and some native Indian individuals who contributed in Bengali or Assamese.

The beginning in the field of colonial studies of Assam was made by J.P. Wade who originally came to the region as a doctor along with Captain Welsh's army in 1792 and compiled *A Geographical Sketch of Assam* (1800/1927). Francis Hamilton-Buchanan wrote *An Account of Assam* (1820, reprint of 1963 in Guwahati) which carries important description of the pre-British Assamese society and economy. Adam White's *Memoir of the Late David Scott* (1832, reprint 1988), R. B. Pemberton's *Report on the Eastern Frontier of British India* (1835), Montgomery Martin's *The History, Antiquities, Topography and Statistics of Eastern India*, Vols. I–II, (1837) and John M' Cosh's *Topography of Assam* (1837, reprint 1986) are some very useful works on this region and were produced, as must be apparent, in relatively quick succession. In 1841, William Robinson wrote his famous work *A Descriptive Account of Assam* (reprint, 1975). In this book, he gives a detailed account of the physical and sociopolitical situation of the province of Assam and also gives useful information on the neighbouring hill tribes. It must be remembered that such attempts were made largely to understand the political economy of the land and the people of northeast India and to decide as to how far the British rule in these regions would be profitable to the colonial enterprise.

The changes in the middle of the nineteenth century in the nature of the colonial rule in India also marked a change in the British writings on northeast India (see Thakur 2015). The recording of revenues, tribe-wise listing and other features of ethnography, which started in other parts of India, became significant in northeast India as well. Thereafter, a band of European writers, viz. John Butler (*A Sketch of Assam* (1847) and *Travels and Adventures in the Province of Assam during a Residence of Fourteen Years* (1855)), William Hunter (*A Statistical Account of Assam*, Vols. I–II (1879)), E.T. Dalton (*Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal* (1872)) and L. W. Shakespeare (*History of Upper Assam, Upper Burma and North Eastern Frontier* (1914)) wrote on various aspects of this region. Various reports or accounts mostly based on personal knowledge and experience and compiled by officers like J.B. Neufville (1928), R. Wilcox (1832), S. F. Hannay (1848, 1851), J.T.E. Dalton (1845), C.A. Bruce (1839), T. Hugon (1837), A. J. Moffatt Mills (1853), G. Dunbar (1913–1917) and Francis Jenkins (1953 and subsequent publications; see Bhuyan, 1949 for discussion on Jenkins writings and reference to works of other officers) were published in the *Asiatic Researches*, *Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal* and even as independent publications. The American Baptist Mission Society too showed keen interest in the study of the history and culture of the people. At their initiative, learned articles, written by the English-educated Assamese intelligentsia, were published in the *Orunodoi*, the first Assamese monthly paper.

Another feature of the colonial historiography in northeast India in the nineteenth century is the publication of scores of books and accounts on the 'frontier tribes'. The students of tribal history today recall with some (reserved) gratitude to the contributions made by the European officers towards advancement of historical studies in this regard. Their intimate knowledge of the tribal customs and institutions and their exploratory habits always placed them on a more advantageous position aimed at the description of the then current lives and conditions of the tribes of northeast India. Among these works, mention must be made of the following: A. J. M. Mills's (1853) *Report on the Cosseah and Jayantiah Hills* (quoted in Saikia, 2014); T.T. Cooper's *The Mishmi Hills* (1873, Indian reprint, 1995); P.R.T. Gurdon's *The Khasis* (1914); Macgregor's *Military Report on the Khamti-Singphoe Country* (1887) and *Selection of Papers Regarding the Hill Tribes Between Assam and Burma and on the Upper Brahmaputra* (1873); Playfair's *The Garos* (1909); J.F. Michel's *Report on the North East Frontier of India* (1883); L.A. Waddel's *The Tribes of the Barhmaputra Valley* (reprint, 1975); S. Endle's *The Kacharis* (1911); and Alexander Mackenzie's *History of the Relations of the Government with Hill Tribes of the North East Frontier of Bengal* (1884). In addition to these, J. Elliot (1789), P.R.T. Gurdon (1904), G.L. Grange (1839), A. Rowlatt (1945), Robinson (1851) and some others wrote interesting narratives in the *Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal*. R.B. Pemberton's *Report on the Eastern Frontier of British India* (1835); Capt. G. Beresford's *Notes on the North-East Frontier of Assam* (1881); C.U. Aitchison's *A Collection of Treatise, Engagements and Sanads Relating to India and Neighbouring Countries* (Compiled) Vol I (1892); and Damant's (quoted in Chakravorty, 1964: ii) *Papers Relating to the Frontier Tribes of North-East Frontier* (1855) and *Selection of Papers (1825–1846) Regarding the Hill Tracts Between Assam and Burma and on the Upper Brahmaputra* (1873) are some other significant contributions towards the historiography of the period.

With the publication of E.A. Gait's *A History of Assam* (1905), historical research in northeast India entered into a new age. Truly speaking, Gait's was the first fulllength history of the prominent province in the region. The book is freely used by scholars till date as an authentic source material. While he was in Assam, Gait had shown keen interest in the study of the history of the region by first compiling *The Assam Land Revenue Manual* (1896) and then preparing a monumental report entitled *Report on the Progress of Historical Research in Assam* (1897) (see Thakur 2007). In the years 1905–1907, B.C. Allen's *Assam District Gazetteers* (in 10 volumes, published by Government of India) was brought out. Though largely not historical in nature and content, this series of ethnographical studies on some of the major tribes of the then Assam made pioneering researches into the lives and customs of the people. These studies were commissioned by the Government in the early part of this century and written by civil servants and missionaries. Despite some views today that these monographs do not quite portray the tribes under study, none of these ethnographic studies have had sequels with the depth that the original had. A further contribution of monographs was the folk stories in the Roman script with English translations that were appended to some of the volumes. Here, I mention some of these: J. H. Hutton's *The Angami Nagas* (1921, reprint Delhi, 1967); idem *The Sema Nagas* (1926, reprint Delhi, 1969); J. P. Mills's *The Ao Nagas* (1926, reprint Bombay 1973); J. P. Mills' *The Lhota Nagas* (London, 1922); J. P. Mills's *The Rengma Nagas* (London, 1922a); W. C. Smith's *The Ao Naga Tribes of Assam* (London, 1925); T. C. Hudson's *The Meitheis* (1908); T.C. Hudson's *The Naga Tribes of Manipur* (1911, reprint Delhi, 1974); P. R. T. Gurdon's *The Khasis* (1907, second edition in 1914); A. Playfair's *The Garos* (1909); S. Endle's *The Kacharis* (1911, reprint Delhi, 1975);

R. Reid's *History of the Frontier Areas Bordering on Assam (1883–1941)* (1942); L.W. Shakespeare's *History of Upper Assam, Upper Burma and the North-East Frontier* (1914); and A. Hamilton's *In Abor Jungles* (1912).

The rule of law has often been considered one of the great gifts of the colonial government to the Indian subcontinent. As the cornerstone of British policy, W.W. Hunter envisioned as far back as 1881 (see Thakur 2007) of a more secure, more prosperous India, where roads, railways, bridges, canals, schools and hospitals had been built; famines tackled; *thugi*, *dakaiti* and predatory casteism suppressed; trade developed; and 'barbaric' social practices like widow-burning and infanticide abolished. However, the various fissures and frictions that existed among the tribal societies made it difficult for Hunter's vision to be made a reality. The relationship between itinerant and sedentary communities, for instance, had always been not just problematic but bound together in a kind of mutual antagonism. Vagrancy, wanderlust, lack of stability and a general guiding purpose in life, restlessness and aimlessness – these were the accusations that plagued all itinerant communities. Nomadic communities were notoriously difficult to control and govern, to administer or tax. They were also romanticized in that they were feared and shunned as ferocious criminals and yet eulogized for their supposedly healthy outdoor lives and independent spirit.

It does not surprise the modern-day reader to know that the failure of the colonial ethnographer and historian to comprehend and theorize the enormous diversity of the tribes of northeast India leads to stereotyping. In this regard, the opinion of L. A. Waddell regarding the tribes, especially the nomadic ones, is the representative opinion of the colonial writers. Waddell writes, 'Driven into these wild glens by the advance of civilization up the plains and lower valleys, these people have become hemmed in among the mountains, where pressing on each other in their struggle for existence, they have developed into innumerable isolated tribes' (quoted in Thakur 2007:114–115). Clearly, he assumes that the tribes are away from the reaches of 'civilization' and maintain absolutely no politico-economic contact whatsoever with their neighbouring tribes. K. A. A. Raja, one of the administrators of erstwhile NEFA and the first Lt. Governor of Arunachal Pradesh, has echoed a similar view. He writes, 'Numerous communities in the earlier stages of material culture had moved away, over centuries, into these hills. They moved in batches and stages depending on pressure exerted. Each batch was self contained and lost contact with the present stock and the related groups in the course of migration. Every fresh arrival pushed those that followed it, from place to place, till they all reached their present habitats. These movements accelerated and intensified the diversification' (ibid., 1975:5). Taking clues from the opinions of L. A. Waddell and K. A. A. Raja, even S. Dutta has expressed views on similar lines. He writes, 'Thus, Arunachal Pradesh, an island itself; popularly known as terra-incognita, till independence, was full of islands of various tribes separated for so many factors. Over the decades after independence**…** the tribal people of Arunachal Pradesh have come into close contact with each other and the rest of the nation through various means of contact' (Dutta 2002; quoted in Tahkur 2007:115) .

As the example of S. Dutta in the previous paragraph demonstrates, the impact of colonial historiography on the Indian historians was such that they also endorsed the approaches of imperial historians in their writings. The observation of R. M. Lahiri (1994/1954:ix) echoes a similar attitude towards India's tribal history '**…**gradually the whole of the North-eastern Frontier containing a variety of races and sub – races not to be found elsewhere in India was brought within *the pale of the enlightened British administration*' (emphasis added). The approach of Lahiri is also clearly expressed in the conclusion to one of his chapters. He writes, '…Such was the country [Assam] that came under the possession of the East India Company after the treaty of Yandabo and here, truly speaking, for the first time in their long annals of victory and conquest in the vast sub-continent of India, *the British seemed to step in as saviours rather than as conquerors. But Assam was a liability rather than an asset- the British Government had taken over a country with a meagre income, a scanty population and a troublesome frontier beyond which dwelt a predatory neighbour*' (emphasis added)(ibid.:31). Thus, in the view of Lahiri too, the hill people have been troublesome and predatory to Assam's natural resources and people. H. K. Barpujari (1970 and 1978), who worked extensively in his lifetime on the tribes of Assam and the rest of northeast India, also seems to have fallen prey to these rather ill-founded lines of historical enquiry. It is not the case of one or two individual historians but scholars in general that they mostly based their researches on the British records and strengthened the mythification of India's northeast as necessarily backward and regressive.

The reason for the attitude stated above has been highlighted by another scholar recently. Nicholas Dirks has directed our attention to the means through which a modern historian writes. He argues that Indian historians have depended a lot on colonial archives, and they have not been able to recover from thinking of India in terms of binaries such oriental despotism and romantic innocence. He writes, 'The archives are the dominant source of history and the same is also realized by even the Subalterns; however, that was not established for national history writing… … historical writing either concerned itself almost exclusively with the British in India or treated India according to the stereotype concerning village community and oriental despotism'(pp. 81–82).

Clearly, Dirks is asking for a careful exegesis of archives by the modern-day historians that does not really compromise on the agency of the subaltern, not a complete rejection of archival and library researches. In a similar vein, much like I have argued earlier in this essay, I am not asking for an all-together rejection of ethnographical studies of northeast India. Instead, I want the modern-day scholars to acknowledge the enormous data analysis that the ethnographers undertake but take the conclusions they reach with a pinch of salt. In fact, for an objective reconstruction of historical past of northeast India, a certain approach has to be developed where the historians use the information contained in the ethnographic accounts judiciously, and the ethnographers also become more considerate in their view of history as a discipline that works through its own 'scientific principles'. As an illustration of the very productive interaction that the coming together of history and ethnography allows for, I would like to conclude this piece by referring to three such occasions from the past:

- 01. The Annales10' influenced localized studies of E. Le Roy Ladurie's (1979) *Carnival in Romans* and Mona Ozouf's (1988) *Festivals of the French Revolution* would not have been possible had the accounts been uninformed by principles of anthropology as well.
- 02. Under the influence of Clifford Geertz (especially his work of 1973 and 1983), historians at Princeton University as well as the likes of Natalie Davis (1975) and Robert Darnton (1984) used anthropology in their researches to promote an effective study of social systems and also to devise ways to encounter new peoples and cultures.
- 03. Eric Hobsbawm, the pre-eminent Marxist historian, edited with anthropologist Terence Ranger (1992) a collection of essays titled *The Invention of Tradition*. Examining various cultures from around the world in the book, Hobsbawm and Ranger argue that some traditions that argue for and point towards their own historicity are in fact invented. Clearly, such a radical suggestion would not be possible if Hobsbawm and Ranger did not have the resources of both history and anthropology available to them.
