#### **Doungul Letkhojam Haokip**

**Abstract** This chapter gives an idea of the notion of the tribe; group formation within a tribe and assertion of identity with Kuki-Chin ethnic group as case study. The Kuki-Chin group which evolved into different identical subgroups in a process of fission over time developed their dialects and Bible was translated into different Kuki-Chin dialects, thereby acting as a disintegrating agent. In unequivocal terms, the chapter holds Bible translation into the dialect of individual subgroups responsible for reinforcing the subgroup divisions within the Kuki-Chin group. Thus, the chapter traces contemporary ethnic issues in Kuki-Chin group to the historical event of Bible translation during colonial period. The chapter argues that the Bible translation into different dialects reinforced the variations and resulted in the assertion of micro group identity on the basis of such variations. The chapter further describes the adverse impact of this translation on tradition in general and on traditional calendar in particular.

# **Introduction**

Before the advent of the British, in what can be called the Kuki-Chin region of present India and Myanmar, the Kuki-Chin people lived in independent villages. Their age old 'chief's cult' or engagement in tribal feuds in the form of 'headhunting', inter- and intra-village rivalries, dispute over ownership of natural resources, migration in different batches and such other activities greatly limited the sphere of their social interaction almost to village community and caused dialectical variations over the years. The colonial policy of controlling them through administration divided their territory between India and Myanmar, and in the postcolonial era, the Kuki-Chin-Mizo ethnic groups got divided among three countries, namely, India,

Myanmar and Bangladesh. During colonial rule, Christian missionaries worked among them with a 'civilizing mission'. For the success of this mission, the missionaries adopted three shortcut methods: the first one was conversion into Christianity, the second was translation of Bible into local dialects and languages, and the third one was establishment of friendly relations with the natives. The efforts of establishing friendliness were also means of attracting the people to the fold of Christianity. Behind this attitude and mission was the hidden agenda of serving the interest of the colonial administration. The colonial government was motivated by profit, demarcated the tribal belts and did not include them under direct administration. However, it had the intention of making permanent relation with the Hills which the missionaries fulfilled through conversion. Translation of Bible was adopted as an element in the process of conversion and apparently in the process of 'civilizing the uncivilized'. The missionaries were directly involved in the translations of Bible and hymns into the dialects and languages of such tribes as 'Meitei, Lusei, Mara, Tedim, Vaiphei Hmar, Haka/Lai, Asho, Thadou-Kuki, Falam, Biate and Hallam'.

Contemporary tribal situation has not evolved out of vacuum; the historical process during the colonial period has largely shaped it; and so it can be studied with reference to the colonial history. The present religious tradition, sociopolitical backwardness or ethnic assertion, can be traced back to colonial history. Bible translation in different dialects, more than 30 (thirty) belonging to a language family, i.e. Kuki-Chin family, is a crucial factor of explaining many of contemporary situations including ethnic assertion on the basis of language.

The history of Bible translation is not very old as it happened during colonial period. But origin of differentiation or separatism from one's cognate tribe or clans has an old history which cannot be traced objectively. Kuki-Chin scholars have listed social divisions such as *Aimol*, *Anal*, *Chiru*, *Chothe*, *Koireng*, *Kom*, *Purum*, *Lamkang*, *Moyon*, *Monsang*, *Gangte*, *Vaiphei*, *Hmar*, *Zou*, *Simte*, *Sukte*, *Ralte*, *Lusei*, *Maring*, *Khoibu*, *Paite*, and *Thadou* even during precolonial period. It is crucial to note that social divisions within the Kuki-Chin tribe assert individual identity on the basis of these dialect/language variations. Each group while recognizing and admitting its Kuki-Chin origin distinguishes itself from others and establishes itself as a distinct identity because of dialectical variation. Despite the sense of differentiation, a force of integration and assertion of the greater Kuki-Chin identity underlies the contemporary sociopolitical scenario in Manipur. In this context, Toynbee's observation that the growth and development of a civilization depends on 'differentiation to integration, and withdrawal and return' (Ali 1978:11) rightly suits to contemporary Kuki-Chin situation which can be examined through the prism of colonial history. In this regard it is to be mentioned that despite dialectical variations, or high and low tone, the entire Kuki-Chin group dialects are intelligible (see Vaiphei 1995: fn-1, p. 3).

The present research problem is not a beginning of the study of Kuki-Chin people against the background of colonial interventions. In fact these people were studied during colonial administration, particularly by missionaries and colonial administrators, to serve greater colonial interest. Subsequently, Kuki-Chin scholars also pursued the study of their own people, their life styles and problems they encountered, following colonial idioms. Literatures produced out of these studies mostly contain the topic of Christianity – the factors and process of conversion including Bible translation, missionary experiences of the people, missionary agenda and mechanism of conversion and impact of conversion on the society and people and the like at the core. A few works were produced during colonial period, such as grammar, dictionaries, premiers, etc., which apparently meant to meet study material requirements in formal education system introduced since colonial period.

However, most of these writings relate to conversion process, for reading and writing are two pillars of Church policy with regard to conversion. Even writings on Kuki-Chin culture had a comparative representation style to situate these people as 'uncivilized' in relation to 'civilized' Europe and, thus, to justify the need for a 'civilizing mission'. In many recent writings, Bible translation has been critiqued from various angles primarily for its role in social disintegration. In view of this, a few representative works have been examined in order to give an idea of the nature of literature available on Kuki-Chin people and justify present investigation.

In *A Critical Historical Study of Bible Translation Among the Zo People in North East India*. KhupZa Go informs us that dialectical translations of the Bible became important factors in the disintegration of the Zo people (Go 1996:6).1 According to him, J. H. Cope, an American Baptist who came to Chin Hills of Burma in 1908, wrote the first Premier in the Chin Languages (Go 1996:14), and J.H. Lorrain, one of the first two missionaries from Britain, began his work in the Lushei Hills in 1894, and after learning Lushei, he composed the first Mizo grammar and dictionary (Go 1996:13). T.S. Gangte's work, *The Kukis of Manipur*, is an interdisciplinary sociohistorical analysis that attempted to relate the disintegration with government policy after Independence. He lamented that 'recognition of tribes by the Government of India hastened the processes of disintegration among the Kuki, for the new constitution of India accorded special privileges to such recognised tribes' (Gangte 1993:10). In *Houbung Kalson* (The Foot Print of Church), Thangkholal Singson (2000) informs about missionary activities. From his work we learn that Kuki-Mission or Thadou-Kuki Pioneer Mission or Indo-Burma Thadou-Kuki Pioneers Mission was set up by Watkin R. Robert in 1910 at Senvon village of Southern Manipur (Singson 2000:10). It is evident from his work that the mission did not address the issue of reorganizing the subgroups; rather the Missions split on the line of dialects and teachings of pioneer missionaries.

R. A. Lorrain's *5 Years in Unknown Jungles*, circulated in the United Kingdom since its publication in 1912, mainly deals with his journey experiences and the socioreligious beliefs, war tactics and folklore of the Lakhers of the Lushei Hills. In his *Implications of Having Independent Missionary*: *A Review of 1910 Kuki Mission*, Jangkholam informs us that Watkins Robert, founder of the Thadou-Kuki Pioneer

<sup>1</sup>By Zo the author means all the Kuki-Chin linguistic groups, about whom we study in this paper. Local researchers and writers are sharply divided into two schools on the naming of the linguistic group we study here. One school of thought rejects Kuki-Chin term on the ground of its outside origin, while others opine that the people are known as Kuki-Chin throughout our history.

Mission, did not obtain license from Manipur Political Agent but preached Christianity in Churachandpur and adjoining areas (Haokip 2014:90). Interestingly, this paper also informs how Bible translators among the Kuki-Chin groups maintained the tendencies of deviating from one another by coining words so as to make the concerned dialect distinct from other analogous dialects (Haokip 2014:92). He argues, 'The decision to translate the Bible into each local dialect rather than to produce a pan-Kuki translation became major disintegrating factor among them following India's Independence' (Haokip 2014:93).

In his *Sociolinguistic Situation in Northeast India* and in a research paper entitled *The Language of Manipur: A Case Study of Kuki-Chin*, Pauthang Haokip describes the force of integration in different Manipuri and Tangkhul dialects. He informs that dialects like Andro, Sengmai, Kakching, etc. have been merged into and replaced by Manipuri. Similarly, distinct and varieties of speech forms found among the Tangkhuls have evolved into a single language, whereas, he laments as he finds intelligible dialects of Kuki-Chin groups such as Paite, Gangte, Thadou, Tidim, Vaiphei, Zou, etc. are treated as separate languages (Haokip 2011b:85). However, he did not give opinions as to why such two contrasting linguistics situations evolved in Manipur. Thus a study on the historical development of the Kuki-Chin Bible perhaps would answer it to some extent. In addition to the above works, *The First One Hundred Years of Christianity in Manipur* (1896–1996) published in December 1996 by MBC Literature Committee, Imphal; *The Amazing Guidance of God* (1910–1985) and *Diamond Jubilee Souvenir* by Independent Church of India, 1985; *History of Christianity in Manipur*, edited by Elungkiebe Zelaing, Christian literature Centre, Guwahati, 2005; and *A History of the Manipur Baptist Convention* by the same author published by MBC Imphal, 2005, also give us information on the coming of Christian missionaries, their activities and the emergence of Churches in Manipur.

The present paper attempts to summarize different dynamics involved in the process of conversion and particularly those related to Bible translation.

### **Kuki-Chin People**

Before focusing on the main theme of this paper, let us know who Kuki-Chin people are. For the sake of convenience, Grierson's term Kuki-Chin is used. In his *Languages of North-Eastern India* Vol. II, George Abraham Grierson stated that 'the territory inhabited by the Kuki- Chin Tribes extends from the Naga Hills in the North down into the Sandowy District of Burma in the south; from the Myittha River in the East, almost to the Bay of Bengal in the West' (Grierson 2006:509). He claims that the term Kuki and Chin are synonymous and are both used for a number of hill tribes interchangeably. He estimated their population to be 600,000 to 1,000,0000 (Grierson 2006:510) and divided the entire Kuki-Chin speakers as Meitei and Kuki-Chin proper.

According to Pauthang Haokip, 'the Term Kuki-Chin is widely accepted amongst the Linguists in all the classifications of these languages' (Haokip 2011a:95). J. Shakespeare, in his *The Lushei-Kuki Clans*, also presents them as the same stock. 'All the Lusei- Kuki Clans resemble each other very closely in appearance and the Mongolian type of countenance prevails. There is no doubt that the Kuki, Chins and Lusei are all of the same race' (Shakespeare 1998:18). In his *The Chin Hills* Vol. I, Bertram S. Carey and H.N. Tuck wrote as follows:

Without pretending to speak with authority on the subject, we think we may reasonably accept the theory that the Kukis of Manipur, the Lusei of Bengal and Assam, and the Chins originally lived in what we now know as Thibet (Tibet), are of one and the same stock, their form of Government, method of cultivation manners and customs, belief and traditions all point to one origin. (Carey and Tuck 2008:2)

The Kuki-Chin linguistic group claims the same route of migration and origin. In his paper 'Nationality Formation: The Case of Kuki',2 Lal Dena pointed out that the term Kuki includes Chin of Myanmar, Lusei of Mizoram and other cognate tribes scattering in Northeast India and Bangladesh. He also pointed out that in Myanmar, it was discarded to become Chin and in Mizoram (earlier Lusei Hills) as Lusei, but the ethnicity of Kuki is strong and active in Manipur, Assam and Tripura. The Kuki people as he argues have common nomenclature, myths of common ancestry, shared historical memories, common cultural heritage, common causes for homeland and common customary practices.

Since language is a crucial component in Bible translation, it would have been useful to Kuki-Chin people as a linguistic group had there been a single language used in Bible translation. As mentioned, a particular language has not been recognized as standard Kuki-Chin, particularly in India; these people have dialectical variations but with greater degree of mutual intelligibility. Grierson (2006) has reported a number of dialects of this group. His report on names of dialects and tribes is reproduced here to analyse and compare with the present speakers. The Meitei speakers were about 240,637. In addition to this, he included different speaker groups under broad language family as below:

Northern Chin languages: Thadou (31,437), Sukte (9,005), Siyin (1770), Ralte (18,133) and Paite (not indicated).

Central group: Tashon (39,215), Lai (22,450), Lakher (1,100), Lushei (40,539), Banjogi (500), and Pankhu (800).

Old Kuki group: Rangkhol (7820), Bete (630), Hallam (26,848), Langrong (6266), Aimol (750), Anal (750), Chiru (750), Hiroi Lamkang (750), Kolren (750), Kom (750), Purum (750), Mhar (2000) and Cha (not indicated).

Southern group: Chinme, Welsung, Chinbok, Yindu and Chinbon were not recorded by Grierson. He only recorded Khyang or Sho (95,599) and Khami (14,626) under this group. The Sothern group also included *Anu*, *Kun*, *Pallang* and *Sak/That*, but the numbers of speakers were not indicated (see Grierson 2006:510–511).

<sup>2</sup>From Personal file of Professor Lal Dena.

The estimates and statistics shown in the *Linguistic Survey of India* no doubt cover the entire territory inhabited by the Kuki-Chin groups in Burma (now Myanmar), India and Bengal (now Bangladesh). He observed that different dialects mentioned above might have originated and/or have been derived from the old Chin language, its home being the Chin Hills and the Lushei Hills (Grierson 2006:516).

### **Why Foreign Missionaries Came to the Kuki-Chin Territory?**

This section deals with a few incidents which became the wolf's logic of missionary entry into Kuki-Chin territory, particularly into Manipur. Formal relation between the British and Manipur goes back to 14 September 1762 (Lal Dena 2012:115) due to the instability of Manipur political situations; but the colonial era began only in 1891 following the Anglo-Manipuri War (Chawngkung 1998:2). The Lusei-Kuki relations with the British on the other hand were punctuated by raids and expeditions since 1828 until the territory of Lusei Hills was occupied by the British in 1890 (Sangkima 2004:145). The Kuki from Lusei Hills raided Cachar, Sylhet and Manipur from time to time, and the British sent a number of expeditions such as Blackwood's expedition in 1849, Lister expedition of 1850 and expeditions of 1869 and 1871–1872 until they occupied the Lusei Hills. Similarly, the Chins raided the villages of Burma plains along Myittha and Chindwin rivers in 1887 (Carey and Tuck 2008:25). As a result of this, the British annexed Chin Hills to Burma (now Myanmar) as a special division in 1896.

In this context it needs to mention that frequent raids into colonial territory and 'curious culture' of the people provided the base for the missionaries to carry out their design of 'civilizing mission'. The early British policy towards the frontier tribes was non-interference in the internal matters of the hill men,3 but their objectives to establish permanent relations with the tribals through missionaries negate it. Alternatively, once the British occupied a territory, missionaries got the avenue to carry out their missions, obligations and assignments they were expected to do by the colonial administration. Bible translation into the native languages and dialects4 was the most powerful tool for preaching Christianity, establishing relations and consolidating the new faith. They followed the trend of variations in Kuki-Chin language, one of the major languages with dialectic variations in the then British Northeast India or farther India and even today. Before coming to the origin and development of translations of Bible, two incidents that took place and attracted the foreign missionaries need a brief introduction.

<sup>4</sup>The word 'Bible' is derived from 'Biblion' which means books. It consists of 66 books altogether and is broadly divided into two – Old Testament (39 books) and New Testament (27 books). Translation originated from the Latin prefix 'trans' which means to 'cross from one side to the other'.

### *'Raids' and Kidnapping of Mary Winchester*

Bible translation was largely crucial to convert the Kuki-Chin tribes into Christian fold; but conversion was apparently considered a means of civilizing the tribes who were involved in 'raids', killings and kidnapping. It is not a surprise to note that missionaries who spearheaded the movement came to Lusei Hills following the frequent raids carried out by the chiefs of Lushei Hills, particularly following the kidnapping of Mary Manchester in 1871 (Woodthorpe 1978:33). Alexander Mackenzie has pointed out that in the morning of 23 January 1871, the Luseis carried out a series of 'raids', burnt Ainakhal village to the south of Hailakandi Valley, Cachar, killed 25 persons and captured 37 as prisoners. Winchester, a planter in a neighbouring tea garden, was among the 25 who were killed, and his daughter, little Mary Winchester, was among those captured (Mackenzie 2011:305–306). B.C. Allen (2013a:27–30) mentions that Winchester was a neighbouring tea planter but paid a visit to the Ainakhal tea garden with his daughter, and while taking breakfast, the unfortunate incident took place (Allen 2013a:27–30). Similar account is presented by Woodthorpe. He claimed that Winchester with his daughter was on a visit to the tea garden, and during that time some coolies were killed; and the manager, little Mary Winchester and several others were carried off for prisoners (Woodthorpe 1978:32). Thangkholal Singson informs us that William Williams, a Welsh Presbyterian missionary, visited Aizawl in 1891 after 20 years of the 1871 incidents of raids and kidnapping who in his report recommended to open up Mission station in Aizawl, now the capital of Mizoram, a state in Northeast India, and was accepted by the Welsh Mission (Singson 2000:1). Similar to this view, Reginald A. Lorrain, a missionary to the extreme South of the Lusei Hills and who worked among the Lakhers, honestly incorporated his thought that came to his mind while seeking missionary sponsorship to work among the Hill tribes (Lorrain 1988:2). No doubt, sociopolitical crisis in the then Northeast India of the colonial rule (e.g. see Wright 1895) was the apparent reason of missionary activities. It can be said that missionaries were an administrative wing of the British government to check raids, threats of attack by the tribes and other troubles by making people friendly through conversion.

## *Killing of Seven British Officials*

William Pettigrew arrived in Imphal, Manipur, after the massacre of five British officials and two others, namely, J.W. Quinton, the then Chief Commissioner of Assam; Lieutenant Colonel Skene; Private Secretary Cossins; Lt. Simpson and Grimwood in 1891 at Imphal (Lal Dena 2014:60; Singh 2002:76–77) along with the superintendent of Telegraph; and Melville and a signaller at Majangkhang, about 33 miles from Imphal during March 24 to 26, 1891. They were killed due to prevailing political situations in Manipur (Allen 2013b:37). According to L. Joychandra Singh, the five ill-fated officials were beheaded in front of the Durbar Hall (Singh 1995:234). According to M. J. Wright, 'while the pretended Conference was going on; the treacherous Jubraj took affairs into his own hands; and ordered the five men to be arrested and put in chains' (Wright 1895/2014:114). Kim Vaiphei pointed out that William Pettigrew was disturbed by the assassination of seven British officers and soon learnt Manipuri language at Silchar (Vaiphei 1995:5). He reached Imphal on the 6th of February in 1894 to become the foreign missionary in the land of Manipur, for the first time. However, the non-interference policy in the sociocultural and internal administration of the princely states/native states of India soon after the 1857 revolt perhaps was applied to Manipur as well. Political Agent of Manipur, Maxwell, sued an order to William Pettigrew to either preach in the hilly areas, where headhunting or the cult of chiefs or warrior was widely practised, or leave Imphal (Lal Dena 1985:7). The event was perhaps the most widely publicized ever since the colonization of the region by the British. Many Western news papers, both vernacular and English, had published under different headings: Manipur Massacre or Massacre of the British troops and/or Massacre of Assam for months together (Greenock Telegraph and Clyde Shipping Gazette, 31 March 1891;3; Shefield daily Telegraph, Friday 17 April 1891: 5; Aberdeen Press and Journal, Thursday 02 April 1891: 5; Bolton Evening News, Lancashire, England, Wednesday 01 April 1891: 3; Nottingham Evening Post County: Nottinghamshire, England Saturday 16 May 1891:2).

The two events perhaps sent out shock waves to the western world. Lal Dena claims that the American Baptist Mission in Burma (Myanmar) made the first attempt to establish Mission Station in Manipur in 1836; but the Prince of Manipur and Political Agent opposed it, and in 1840, Rev. Jacob Tomlin again included Manipur while suggesting three places where the Welsh Calvinistic Methodist Foreign Mission Society, Liverpool, could send their missionaries. But due to the unstable political situations, no missionary was allowed to enter Manipur (Lal Dena 2014:104). The Catholics and other Protestant missionaries were already preaching in Assam: American Baptist, 1836, in Assam and Welsh Mission 1841 in present Meghalaya. Thus, one can say that the defeat of the Manipuri at Khongjom by the British in the Anglo-Manipur War, 1891, and the occupation of Lusei-Kuki Hills by the British followed by the visit of William Williams to Aizawl in 1891 laid the foundation of opening mission centres in Manipur and Lushei Hills.

### **Course of Bible Translation**

In his paper 'Bible Translation in Indian Context', K. Regu (2000) makes a thorough survey and claims that the Old Testaments were available since the thirteenth century BC to the first century AD in Hebrew; but translation of it was considered sin and punishable until Wycliffe, an English Professor of Oxford University, translated it in 9 years (1375–1384 A.D) and later in India; out of 1652 languages spoken, Bible translation of all the 66 books was done in 60 languages and a portion of it in 222 languages. He also informs that Tibeto-Burman groups – Kuki-Chin, Naga Bodo, Mikir, Aka, Dafla (now Nyishi), Singpho and various speech communities of

Nepal and Himachal Pradesh – constitute only 4% in India.5 He has also asserted that translators required mastery over the source language and the target language (Regu 2000:125–137).

However, the first effort of Bible translation in Kuki-Chin began in the second decade of the nineteenth century in Serampore (West Bengal). The Meitei version on a portion of the Bible and the New Testament by William Carey, Joshua Marshman and William Ward was published by Serampore Mission Press, West Bengal, in 1820 and 1827, respectively. The Holy Bible was published by BSI in 1984. The books were printed at Serampore Mission Press, West Bengal.6 In the Lusei Hills, Bible translation kicked off with the translation of the Gospel of Mathew in Tedim dialect by Joseph Herbert Cope of the American Baptist Mission (hereafter as ABM) and was published in 1914 (Nida 1972:68). Watkin R. Roberts, the founder of the Indo-Burma Thadou-Kuki Pioneer Mission in Manipur south, translated the Gospel of John in Vaiphei which was published by BSI in 1917. New Testaments were translated by Siaklam, Liankhopau, Khaivung, Zamkai and Pauva and published by BSI in 1957 and the Holy Bible by Th. Lamboi which was published by Trinitarian Bible Society (Go 1996:79). But for reasons not known to us, the progress in Vaiphei is slow as compared with Hmar, Paite and Thadou-Kuki. F. J. Sandy of the Welsh Presbyterian Mission at Aizawl translated the Gospel of Mark in *Hmar* dialects 1920, New Testaments in 1946 and entire Bible in 1968.7 The *Haka/Lai* dialect is the lingua franca in the Haka division of the Chin Hills in Myanmar. Laura Hardin, sent to Burma in 1883 by the Women's American Baptist Foreign Mission Society of the West, 3 years later married Arthur E. Carson (Carson 1997: v–vi). She was the first missionary sent in the Chin Hills. Laura Carson and Chester Strait's work on the Book of Acts and New Testaments were published in 1920 and 1940, respectively.8

This was followed by David Van Bik and Robert G. Johnson's translation of the Old Testament, published by United Bible Society through BSI in 1978 (Go 1996:80). Bible translation in Asho, spoken in the plains of Irrawaddy lowlands of Myanmar and Chittagong Hills in Bengal (now Bangladesh), was another milestone. G. Whitehead of the Anglican Society for Propagation of Gospel translated the Gospel of Mark (Roman Scripts); it was published by Bible Society, Rangoon, in 1921 and the New Testament (Burmese Scripts) translated by SamoThla U in 1954 (Go 1996:81). The next Kuki-Chin dialect was Thadou-Kuki spoken in Manipur, Nagaland and Assam in India and in Burma, now Myanmar. Ngulhao Thomsong and William Pettigrew translated the Gospel of John in 1924; and Ngulhao Thomsong, Dr Crozier and Mabel Borsworth together translated the New

<sup>6</sup>The Meitei Bible translation indicates two apparent motives – a strong tendency to preach Christianity in Manipur and to establish link between the colonial government and foreign missionaries.

<sup>7</sup>Hmar Bible translators: H. S. Thanglung, H.L.Sela and others under the supervision of Paul Rostad of Northeast India General Mission at Churchandpur. The Old Testament (OT) and Revised New Testament (NT) in Hmar dialect have been translated by H.S. Thanglung, H.L. Sela, N. Nghingloa, Rochung Pudaite, Hrilrokhum Thiek, Sumkung and Awikung.

Testament which came out in 1942 (Kipgen 2012:26–28). After a gap of almost three decades, a complete Bible in Kuki by T. Lunkim was published by BSI in 1971 (Kipgen 2012:57–59). In the Falam division of the Chin Hills, J. H. Cope assisted by Aung Dwe translated the Book of Acts and First Corinthian in *Falam* in 1933, the New Testament in 1951 by BSR and the Old Testament by E. Kyon Bill and Stephen HreKion in 1991. Khumi spoken in the Southern Chin Hills also got their version of Bible when Edwin Rowlands of NEIGM (Northeast India General Mission) and E. W. Francis assisted by Heng Ngaw, Pra Neaung and Len Vai translated the Gospel of Mark in 1945 and the New Testament in 1959, which were published by Bible Society, Rangoon (Go 1996:82).

It is to be further mentioned that T. C Tiankham, Nengzachin, Vungthawn, Chinlang and Thangkhawgin translated the Gospel of John and epistles in Paite which were published by NEIGM 1940; the New Testament was translated by the same group which was published by BSI in 1951.9 Nengzachin, T. Jamkhothang, Vungthawn, Nengthawn, G. Khamkam and Englian also revised the New Testament which was published by BSI in 1959. The Holy Bible translated by Nengjachin and his associates in Paite was published in 1971 by BSI (Kipgen 2012:32). Looking at the time and space taken by the Bible translators, Paite dialect becomes the fastestgrowing literature in terms of the Bible translations. A portion of Bible in Anal dialect or language published in 1949 was used until the New Testament was published in 1983 and the Holy Bible published in 2006.10 Biate, a dialect spoken in Cachar and Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya, got the Bible in their mother tongue when Rengpuia Darnei and R.G. Jones of Welsh Presbyterian Mission translated the Gospel of Mark and Mathew in 1949 and 1958, respectively; and Rualkhupa Biate translated the New Testament in 1985 which was published by BSI (Go 1996:83). Translation of the Old Testament is in progress since 1989 by D.C. Haia. Khua Mying and R.G Johnson of ABM translated the Gospel of Mathew in Zotung and was published by BSR in 1951. Similarly, translation of the New Testament Bible in Gangte was undertaken by Thangzakam and Vungzadal and got published in 1959 by BSI. Khaigin Gangte of Evangelical Christian Synod translated the entire Bible, and it got published in 1991. Lungkholen, an Evangelist of ABM, translated Mathew in *Korem*, a dialect spoken in Manipur Hills; it was published by the Bible Society in 1954. Daniel Kom, Sumkholen Serto, L. Chengpu, Thadai Serto and Sonkhosei translated the New Testament which got published in 1976 (Kipgen 2012:32). Ramlien Pudaite, a Hmar Speaker, translated the Gospel of John in *Simte* in 1957. Keeping in view the translation of the New Testament and the Holy Bible, the Simte joined the Baptist Mid-Mission in 1959, whose headquarters is at Alipur, near Silchar, and accordingly Trinitarian Bible Society of London published the New Testament in 1975; and the Holy Bible (King James English Version as source language and Simte as the target language) was completed in 1993. Simte is a dialect

very close to Zou, Tiddim, etc. According to KhupZa Go, BSI does not publish the Bible in a dialect where the number of speaker is less (Go 1996:85).

*Hallam* is a collective term for a number of clans living in Tripura and Chittagong Hills. The Gospel of Mark was translated into *Hallam* by Mrs. F.W Waldock of Baptist Mid-Mission, Jogeswar Chorei and Mikir Mullick; it was published in 1960. The script used for translation of Bible into *Hallam* is Bengali. Linguistically it is more close to Hmar, Komrem of Manipur, Biate, Hrangkhol, etc. Bawm is another dialect of the Kuki-Chin which has been used for Bible translation from the 1960s. The Gospel of Mark translated by H. Dala, Kualthang, Leniar and Chalkup was published in 1961, the Gospel of John in 1965, the Book of Acts in 1966 and the New Testament by S.L Pardo in 1977. They also have a strong connection with the Lais of Myanmar and Mizoram (Go 1996:87). Zou is a dialect found in Manipur south. The New Testament translated by Semkhopau Samte, T. Tungnung and P. Khaizakham was published by the BSI in 1967. The Zou Holy Bible including Aprocrypha was a joint venture of the Presbyterian and the Roman Catholics in 1983. Presbyterian Church nominated Taithul for translation work, and accordingly Presbyterian version was released in 1992.

Darlong is a dialect spoken in Tripura. The Darlong Christians had to suffer due to less number of speakers when BSI did not respond to their approach for Bible translation. They continued to use Lusei Bible and hymn. In 1987, Bible for the World published 2000 copies of the New Testament in Darlong, and thence BSI got copy right of it; and at present it brings out copies from time to time. In 2005, the Holy Bible was published by Bible for the World. The Siyin dialect, spoken in Chin Hills, had a portion of the Bible around 1997, and the New Testament and the complete Bible were published in 1999 and 2004, respectively. The New Testament along with Psalm and Proverb in Rangkhol, an Old Kuki group, and the Holy Bible was published by BSI in 1996 and 2006, respectively. Rangkhol dialect is closer to Biete, Hallam, Chiru, Aimol and Langrong.11 The New Testament was translated by Lalneithang and the Old Testament by the team of Lalneithang, S.C. Palal and Elder S.T. James. Bible for the World also published the Rangkhol Bible.12 Lamkang New Testament was published by BSI in 2002. Moyon dialect is much closer to the Anal. The Moyon people used to speak Anal till the 1960s. However, due to uncompromising attitude of the Anals to develop their literature, the Moyons felt being left out and adopted their own course in developing the literature in Moyon dialect. Accordingly, BSI took up the Moyon dialect as a project in Bible translation, and the literature created was published in 2008. Similarly, Th. Kothabegan Monsang started translating Bible since 1997, which was published by BSI and was released on 3 February 2009 at Japhou.13 Koireng, an old Kuki tribe, also has a portion of Bible since 2000. Tarao has four gospels or a portion of Bible, published by BSI

since 2009; and of late Peter Chiru translated the New Testament in Chiru which was released on 10 April 2010. In Mizoram the New Testament in Ralte dialect is available, but in course of time, many Ralte speakers use the Bible available in Lusei.14 Siyin tribe in Chin Hills has a portion of the Bible; but no detail information is available. The New Testament and the complete Bible in the same dialect were published in 1999 and 2004, respectively. BSI publication of Aimol New Testament awaits formal release programme.

### **Impact of Bible Translation: Group Dynamics**

Bible translation eroded traditional calendars of the ethnic groups under study. Most of the Bible translators derived name of the 7 days from the Genesis Bible, and some had taken down name of weekdays from the Lusei Bible and literature. The work of missionaries or Bible translators totally ignored names of a week counted in local dialects, thereby eroding their identity. Names of a week in the traditional system are heavily derived from rites and rituals and that of the 12 months after seasonal changes.15 Retaining names of the week does not hold foot in the new faith after the translation of the Bible.

Besides general impact on various aspects of culture, Bible translation had crucial effect on language groupings. Like all preliterate societies, Kuki-Chin ethnic groups of people do not have their own scripts. They used Roman, Bengali and Burmese scripts for writing and translating Bible. Pau Chin Hau invented an indigenous scripts in Myanmar and used for translating a portion of Bible verses (Sermon on the Mount). However, people themselves could not read the script, and continuation of it was not possible (Go 1996:77). Secondly, individualistic tendency of each group of Kuki-Chin stock turned to be a factor of standoff between two or more dialectical groups for a dialogue of sharing. The BSI policy of market-oriented languages/dialect based on number of speakers acted as a source of tensions.16 The Maras felt that the Luseis were the brain behind for non-continuation of subsequent publications in Mara Bible by BSI. The development of Moyon dialect whose speakers shared the language of the Anal until the 1960s was another example of what Toynbee called 'differentiation or withdrawal' introduced in the process of

<sup>14</sup> J. Doungel, Professor and Head, Department of Political Science, Mizoram University, informed us that Ralte is a mix language comprising Hmar, Thadou, Lusei, etc. At present it is a dialect of the elders, and the youngsters have started speaking Lusei. He also estimated the Ralte speakers to be 50,000 (fifty thousand). Based on interview with him on several occasions.

The names are taken from HSO (Haokip Students' Organization) calendar, 1999.

Bible translation. Withdrawing from its group or category to form newer dialectical base on the variation could thrive among them. Interestingly, the Aimol with a population of 3190 as per 2011 census has three dialects – *Sutpong*, *Khurai* and *Langrong*. 17 The Gospel of Mark and the New Testament were translated in Kom Rem that has 18,623 souls (Koirao/Thangal, (1200); Koireng (10, 56) and Kom (15,467)) and published in 1954 and 1976, respectively, by BSI. Later, a portion of Bible translation in Koireng began in 1997 which was published in 2000.

We can view the impact on the society from two perspectives: differentiation along with withdrawal and integration following Toynbee as mentioned earlier.

### *Differentiation*

Sharing of dialects among groups having close affinity would have been of strategic significance in developing a common language for them. But this did not happen during colonial period. The root of differentiation also watered after India's Independence consequent upon legal recognition of distinct identities emerged during colonial period on the basis of dialectical variations and creation of literature for each of them through Bible translations18. As a result it becomes difficult to integrate the closer dialects which are very much intelligible among groups but nourish the individualistic tendency. Attitude to retain old names, lack of spirits and courage to give up lesser traditions in favour of a greater identity, etc. often stand as an obstruction in the process of developing a common language. It is to be further stated that Thadou-Kuki or Kuki dialects with or without variation have been sharply divided into two schools of thought over the nomenclature of the dialects or language. Formally, Paite become a tribe in Manipur since 1956 but called themselves Chin till the 1960s; but interestingly their dialect is more closer to the Teddim and Thadou.19 In a situation where separation tendency was fertile among them, the British policy to establish their sovereignty and power into the Hills took the

<sup>17</sup>Langrong might have been one of the old Kuki groups mentioned by Grierson (2006:511).

<sup>18</sup>Ngulhao Thom Song translated the New Testament (27 books of the Bible) under the supervision of Dr. Crozier and Mrs. Mabel Borswoth Crozier, missionaries posted at Kangpokpi, Sadar Hills Manipur. Credit of translating the Old Testament goes to Tongkhojang Lunkim of the Kuki Baptist Convention, now Administrative Secretary of the Kuki Christian Council, Dewlahland, Imphal, Manipur. Bible Translation in Thadou was undertaken by the Thadou Baptist Association by constituting a Committee under the Banner of Thadou Christian Literature. Translators of the entire Bible of King James Version include S.L. Palal, Vumkam Kipgen, SongkhohaoKigen, Letkhoseh, ThangpuKipgen, SeikholamSitlhou, D. Singson and Thangkholet Kipgen. According to S. Kipgen, Bible Society of India (BSI) put restriction on publication of it due to conflict over the nomenclature of the dialects – Thadou, Thadou-Kuki and Kuki. It was in 2002 that Thadou Baptist Association and BSI came to terms, and after the recommendation of the Manipur Baptist Convention, it was published in 2008. For details see Kipgen, 2012.

<sup>19</sup>According to Hat Zaw of New Lamka, Paite dialect is an offshoot of the Teddim Chin; the Paite mentioned it in one of their memorandums submitted to the Prime Minister of India in the 1960s demanding creation of Chin State in Manipur.

advantage of the gap between two or more groups easily and confined them to demarcated territorial boundaries. The best example is the formation of Kuki Levy at Cachar in June 1850 to employ scouts in the Lushei Hills, to collect information and also to watch over the Kuki of Cachar areas and Manipur (Woodthorpe 1978:14). This increased age old enmity among the Kuki themselves. Due to their shared spoken words and linguistic roots, the missionary who came to civilize them took the advantage of variations in dialects in the process of conversion to Christianity. The attitude of differentiation among different groups of the Kuki-Chin stock fully bloomed after their dialects got legal recognition in 1956.20 Post 1956 marked the emergence and formation of ethnicity and national organizations in Manipur south.21 Some of the tribal leaders involved in the Bible translation were politicians as well.22

Interestingly, Bible translation and the art of writing the tribal dialects/languages by the missionaries also laid the foundation of the emergence of Tangkhul as a language in Manipur east and in Mizoram in contrast to the Kuki-Chin dialects discussed above. The tribal disintegration in languages reached the highest peak among the Tangkhul or Lahupa who had the tradition of practising headhunting till the arrival of William Pettigrew. The origin and development of about 300 dialects among the Tangkhuls23 was an indication of the disintegration at the peak, a point one cannot go beyond. Rishang Keishing informs us that there were 300 subtribes under the nomenclature Tangkhuls in Ukhrul district, each with different dialects and without any common dialect of intercommunication even in the olden days. Even in recent years, there was no effort to develop a common language. It is evident when K. Prongo, a Tangkhul leader, expressed his desire to develop different forms of Tangkhul speech before the officials of Central Institutes of Indian Languages, Mysore, who conducted workshops on tribal dialects and languages at Manipur University.24

Nevertheless, the spirit of integration was never dead. In fact disintegration at its highest peak laid the foundation of a movement for integration during the colonial period in Manipur, India.

<sup>20</sup>Legal recognition refers to inclusion of name of communities to the list of Scheduled Tribes of the Constitution of India.

<sup>22</sup>T.C. Tainkham was the first speaker of Manipur Assembly; S.L. Lunneh who was involved in Thadou Bible and Literature works also to become an elected member in Manipur Assembly in his later days. Till 1951, there were three categories of tribes in Manipur – Any Kuki, Any Naga and Any Lusei; but in 1956, notification of Scheduled Tribe in Manipur, Any-Kuki, was further split into more than 20 tribes and Any Naga into 8 tribes; but Any Lusei (now Mizo) remained the same. After splitting up some of the old Kuki tribes become New Naga despite their unbreakable cultural traits and tenets with their cognate tribes and clans.

<sup>23</sup>Grierson (2006:375) classified Any group of Nagas of Manipur into two – Naga-Kuki group and Naga Bodo group. The former includes Mao, Maram, Mayangkhang, Koireng, Luhupa/Tangkhul and Maring.

The pioneer missionaries, who preached and translated Bible, belonged to different cultural backgrounds, missions and faiths – Baptist, Evangelical, Catholic, Presbyterian, etc. Their socioreligious backgrounds are some time attributed to the cause of division among Kuki-Chin people; but it is too early to say here without verification. One of our respondents for this work claims that the Hmar population in Northeast India is between 2 and 3 lakhs, but only 1.5 lakhs speak Hmar languages, and most of them speak other Kuki-Chin dialects like Lusei, Thadou, etc.25 The case is equally true to many clans and tribes. Speaking a dialect which is more common in the areas they inhabit is a common phenomenon, and people living in a region or territory were equally responsible for the formation, origin, growth and development of a dialect. Thus, naming a dialect to one particular tribe or clan or village has internal contradictions.

Christianity and Bible translations are two faces of the same coin. Sometimes it had drawn the Kuki-Chin dialect speakers to controversial issues – exclusiveness, nomenclature, growth of more and more Churches on the line of tribe clan disputes over Church doctrines and competition for more Church members, etc.

Nativization of names of the books, personalities or names of individual in the Bible was adopted in different dialects of the Kuki-Chin. For example, the book of *Mathew* is written as *Mathew* in Thadou Kuki and, *Mathai* in Hmar and in some other dialects. Jesus is localized as *Jesu*, *Isua*, etc. This follows the pattern of Malayalam of South India in which Mathew is titled as *Mathai*, *Mathan*, *Mathaaikutty*, *Maattuni*, etc. in translation to local dialects even within a single language. An amount of outside influence in the Bible translation, particularly bearing the cultural background of the missionaries, could be an interesting topic of further investigation. When the name of a person got changed in translation, manipulation on the part of translators could not be ruled out. The search for coining new words and terms for distinctiveness or uniqueness from the other is a clear testimony to the practice of manipulation. The practice intensified the already apparent differentiation among dialects, and this created differentiation continues till today.

In his *The Gospel in Man's Mother Tongue Is What Speaks to His Heart* (1963), G. E. Marrison comes to the conclusion that most of the literatures produced among different Kuki-Chin tribes are related to Bible story, hymns translations, stories of foreign Missionaries, etc. Naming of persons after Biblical heroes and other characters, which is found in the Bible by the ethnic groups under study, is the contribution of Christianity and Bible translations.

The conflict for operational areas and ideological differences among the pioneer missionaries who took all the pains of spreading Christianity in the Hilly regions laid two foundations – grouping of Kuki-Chin people on the basis of local dialectical variations and impact of pioneer missionary's cultural backgrounds and teachings or doctrines adopted. In Manipur North and Northeast, misunderstanding came up among the missionaries, particularly among Roberts, William Pettigrew and Fraser. William Pettigrew had sent a letter to Welsh Mission District seeking information on the Missionary activities among the Kuki as planned by Robert and

<sup>25</sup> Interview of Irine (24) Halflong N.C Hills on 1 September 2016.

Fraser. William Pettigrew claimed that the entire Hill area of Manipur was under the operation of American Baptist Mission. As a result Manipur Political Agent sued order to pastor Dalla to leave Manipur. The American Baptist Mission and Welsh Mission at last settled the issue of their respective operational areas, dividing Manipur South and North at Old Chachar Road (Vaiphei 1995:23). The longcherished dreams of Pettigrew came true when Rev. and Mrs. U.M Fox arrived at Ukhrul in 1911. U.M. Fox was responsible to covert the Kuki in massive numbers. By 1917, opening of Mission Centre at Kangpokpi was granted by the Maharaj Churachand Singh and state Durbar. Immediately C.G. Crozier, an American Baptist Missionary, moved to the site and started school, hostel, dispensary, Sunday school, etc. William Pettigrew, who was not present in Manipur, returned in 1921 and joined Crozier. The two families worked together for sometimes, but soon their differences surfaced, and Pettigrew's work confined to Naga areas and Crozier's work among the Kukis (Zeliang 2005:35–37).

### *Integration Dynamics*

To meet the pressing need of books for his students, William Pettigrew reduced the Ukhrul dialect into written form using Roman scripts and got the Tangkhul First Premier published in 1897 and the Second Premier in 1898 and used as textbooks. In 1889, he prepared the Third Premier containing the life of Jesus Christ and also a Catechism for the boys to study on every Sunday. Simultaneously, for the schools in Imphal valley, he prepared three Manipuri Meaning Books and a Manipuri First Premier using Bengali scripts (Zeliang 2005:26–27). The Bible translated by William Pettigrew and his wife in 1936 was intelligible for those who are in formal education in Ukhrul, the only education centre in the hills by that time. In course of time, it became a turning point, from 'differentiation to integration' and/or 'withdrawing to return'. The Bible translation had shaped a common platform for their future. Needless to mention here, even the night schools for women in Ukhrul and Boys Hostel at Imphal, which were opened by him, have become a model for the Manipur Government until today (Zeliang 2005:30). The different forms of Meitei dialects too lost their distinctiveness due to intermarriage and urbanization. Similarly, there were many tribes and clans in Mizoram, but the translation of Bible in Lusei and Mara perhaps absorbed many smaller dialects to emerge as a language called Mizo *tawng*.

### *Dialects, Gaps and Identity*

The Kuki-Chin dialects are found across three countries – India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. It is to be noted that Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura, Assam and Meghalaya in India; Chin Hills and Kabo Valley in Myanmar; and Chittagong tract

in Bangladesh are the regions where Kuki-Chin language speakers are found. Presently about 30 Kuki-Chin dialects are reduced for Bible translation. Grierson (2006:510–511) classified the Kuki-Chin languages into four divisions – *the Northern group*, *Central group*, *Old Kuki* and *Southern group* as already mentioned above. Interestingly, *Simte*, *Zou and Vaiphei* are not incorporated. It is difficult to say whether the three dialects absent in his survey emerged during the post linguistic survey, while a portion of Bible translation in Vaiphei was started in 1914 and was published in 1917, the period contemporary to the linguistic survey. It must be noted that Paite population is not indicated, and Vaiphei, Simte and Zou are not incorporated. This simply shows the surveyor might have incorporated them in one or more of the Northern groups. The variations among the Vaiphei, Thadou and Gangte on the one hand and the Simte, Zou, Paite and Teddim on the other hand are not significant; these dialects are more close to one another. On the basis of tonal variation, the entire Kuki-Chin language may be divided into two groups: R group and G group (Kamkhenthang 2011:1–5); and the division does not make the communication among the groups unintelligible. In his Lal Dena Journal, named after him, a blog in social media, Lal Dena posted an article on *Chin-Kuki-Mizo of Northeast India and Bangladesh.* In this article he had strongly argued that:

Language is not a barrier among them. Even a few days' stay in any community enables them to communicate to one another in their own dialects easily. Pick up few hundred vocabularies of the Languages of these Chin Kuki Mizo you will find more than 60 per cent similar words. (Lal Dena 2014)

In the same paper, he also pointed out that 'one of the worst victims of the British Imperialism and perhaps the most misunderstood ethnic groups are the Chin-Kuki-Mizo people who are found today in India, Bangladesh and Myanmar' (Lal Dena 2014). It can be speculated that their socioeconomic and political system might have become a social barrier compounded by the location of their villages-rugged hills, or mountains, and ridges strategically good for protecting themselves from enemies but on the other hand isolated them to the outside world, leaving no room for loan words. After years and years or centuries after centuries, dialect variation and newer identity were certain to emerge. If we look at the present scenario, the Kuki-Chin groups' mobility for nomenclature is very dynamic. Clan affiliation to some other tribe, tribe mobility from one nomenclature to other, can be rightly observed.26 Deviation could be what T.S. Gangte called 'Kuki Centrifugal Force' that divided or disintegrated the Kukis (see Singh and Priyadarshni 2010:192–194).

<sup>26</sup>Kolhen, a village in Churachandpur, belongs to Kipgen clans since a long past; in the 1970s they merged to Vaiphei tribe; similarly Baite who belongs to Thadou merged to Vaiphei; tribe or clan mobility can be seen even today.

### **Conclusion**

To conclude, Grierson has incorporated 36 of Kuki-Chin dialects including Pankhu in his work as mentioned above. In our survey during filed study, the total number of dialects comes to 50 (fifty) from India, Myanmar and Bangladesh. Bible translations were carried out in 33 dialects, out of which a complete Bible was translated in 13 dialects and a portion of it in 20 dialects. Only the New Testament was translated in 20 dialects out of the 33 dialects. Christianity and Bible translations took variations in Kuki-Chin languages to a new height and widened the existing chasm. Bible translation into a number of Kuki-Chin dialects was a historic event in the Church History of India, Myanmar and Bangladesh (IMB). It cultivated language and dialect consciousness but hastened linguistic disintegration. Contemporary search for nomenclature of course indicates that there was a time when the different clans or villages of the community under study had withdrawn or differentiated from one another. The competition for Bible translation inculcated the tendency of competitions in their daily life. The sad part is that their differentiation on the eve of their contact with the British made their unity almost invisible to the colonial administration and divided them in a number of countries – India, Burma (Myanmar) and Bangladesh conveniently. They are now marginalized people, and what will be the outcome from their bitter experience on the international borders will be an interesting area of investigation. Would they come forward for integration, meaning return from differentiation and withdrawal or continue to remain differentiated as they are is a matter of time, for integration is succeeded by disintegration and the latter is succeeded by former, both are cyclic in nature.

In the course of Bible translation in individual Kuki-Chin dialects, new terminologies were introduced. As a result, visible differences were noticed in earlier affinity among language/dialectical groups. Secondly, their conversion to Christian fold created new enthusiasm which alienated them from appreciating their own traditions. As people distanced themselves from traditions, they ignored and forgot the oral tradition that would tell them their common origin. The rich orality they had shared for a number of centuries got divided along new linguistic identity created through Bible translations. Naming a dialect after a tribe, group, clan, ancestor, progenitor or locality got rooted to deviation or sense of differentiation and often punctuated by exclusiveness and ethnocentrism leaving no room for loan words from other groups. The number of speakers within a specific group only used the language, and the language lost its dynamism to grow for want of loan words and more speakers. The interesting part of language differentiation processes is that some of the Scheduled Tribes having very little population in Manipur and northeast are now in the bracket of endangered language groups. The threat is looming large on the possibility of its extinction in view of its competition with powerful languages having linkage with market. Obviously, the possibility of loss also would be the cause of the loss of the culture and the rich tradition of orality and oral literature of the Kuki-Chin linguistic groups.
