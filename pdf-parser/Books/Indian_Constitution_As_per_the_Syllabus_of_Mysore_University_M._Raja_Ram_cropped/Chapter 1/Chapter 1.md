# **BASIC STRUCTURE OF CONSTITUTION**

**Meaning of the term 'Constitution' – Its Importance – Making of the Indian Constitution 1946-49 – Dr. B. R. Ambedkar's Contribution – Preamble – Method of Amending the Constitution – An Overview of Constitutional Developments**

Government: Government: A country has a definite boundary. The people residing in the country are its citizens. To ensure a peaceful and orderly life in the country, an organization is required. Such an organization is called the Government. It organizes the people and looks after their welfare. How is a government formed? What are its powers, functions and organs? What are the rights of the citizens? Answers to these questions are found in a document known as the 'Constitution'.

Constitution: Constitution: The word 'Constitution' is developed from the word 'Constitute', which means 'to frame or to establish or to compose'. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'Constitution' means a 'system', according to which the laws and principles of the State is governed. It is a set of fundamental rules according to which the government of a State. It is a document which contains the rules and regulations guiding the administrations of a State. It defines the relationship between the rulers and the ruled and how rulers are created in the country. It may be written, or unwritten as in the case of Great Britain. It explains the powers belonging to the government, the fundamental rights of the citizens and the relationship between the citizens and the government. It upholds the principle that all citizens are equal before the law. Any law which is not in accordance with the Constitution becomes invalid.

It is a document which is the supreme law of the land. It has derived from a Latin word 'salus populi suprema lex' meaning 'welfare of the people is the supreme law'. Hence, the Constitution of India is a public document which is considered as the voice of the people. It is the document having a legal sanctity. Constitution is an important instrument which confers powers, rights, functions, principles, restrictions and obligations on the part of individuals, states and everybody who are the citizens of India. The purpose of the Constitution is to maintain harmonious relations between the individuals and the states on the one hand and between the different organs of the government on the other. The Constitution reflects the will and wish of the people.

There are THREE pillars of the Constitution: Legislature, Executive and Judiciary. This is known as 'Doctrine of Separation of Power' (Lord Montesquieu). There are TWO types of Constitution: Rigid and Flexible Constitutions.

#### **Partition and Independence of India**

Wavell Plan and Shimla Conference: Lord Wavell relieved Linlithgao as the new Viceroy of India in October, 1943. The Second World War also ended in 1945. Elections were to be held in England. Sensing the increasing popularity of the Labour Party, the Churchill government again tried to convey the message that the British government was determined to carry out the constitutional reforms in India. Churchill called Lord Wavell to England in 1945 for discussion. On his arrival back in India, Lord Wavell offered a new plan for Constitutional Reforms. Lord Wavell summoned Conference of Indian leaders at Shimla on 25th June, 1945. All the political persons were released from jails. Gandhi was also set free from the house arrest. The representatives of the Congress, the Muslim League, Sikhs, the oppressed class and the Europeans in the Central Parliament attended the Conference. Lord Wavell tabled his Plan and which was outlined the proposal to end the communal problem, remove the political deadlock and reconstitution of the Executive Council of Viceroy.

It was proposed to leave the Executive Council completely in charge of the Indians, excepting the Commander-in-Chief. All the departments were proposed to be transferred to the Indians. The responsibility of the new Council was to devise the system of Administration and Constitution. Under the plan, the Viceroy's authority and rights were to remain intact, but the Viceroy was not misuse his authority and rights. It was also proposed to summon a joint meeting of all parties to prepare anonymous or separate lists for appointment of members of the Executive Council.

On papers, the Wavell Plan appeared reasonable and progressive, but in practice, Lord Wavell did nothing to remove the communal and separatist trends, he rather helped it to take deeper roots. The appointment of the members to the Executive Council became a bone of contention. The scheduled tribes demanded separate representation. The Plan as well as the Conference ended in failure, due to the unreasonable attitude of Jinnah and short-sightedness of Lord Wavell, on 14th July, 1945.

In the general elections of England, held in July, 1945, the Labour Party of England gained majority and Churchill was replaced by C. R. Attlee as the new Prime Minister of England. The Labour Party was moderate in its policy towards India. Soon after this Lord Wavell was summoned to England for talks on the Indian problems. Attlee announced holding of elections in India for the Provincial as well as the Central Councils. In 1945-46 elections, the Congress gained in the general category and Muslim League in reserved category. The Congress won 57 and the Muslim League 30 seats for the Central Assembly. Likewise, Congress got majority in the Provincial Councils. In the Hindu dominated provinces, the Congress formed the cabinet. The Muslim League formed the government in Bengal and Sind, but in Punjab, a coalition government was formed under the leadership of Khijr Hayat Khan.

Cabinet Mission Plan: The position of the British after the end of Second World War was in critical situation and they wanted to please Indians in order to prolong their rule in India. The British could no more depend on the Indian Administrative Machinery, the Indian Police or the Indian Army. That was the greatest problem. The entire nation was engulfed by Movements and the indigenous kings were up in revolt.

 Police had joined in these revolts. The revolt by the men of the Indian Navy on 18th February, 1946 added fuel to the fire. The British government got perturbed. Attlee announced on 19th February, 1946 to send a Cabinet Mission to India to look into the problems of the Indians. He also said that it was the right of India to decide what kind of the constitution they wanted. Attlee demanded the protection of the rights of the minority to stop the people in majority from taking strides in their progressive policies. It was an important announcement. First time, the British government had uttered the word 'Freedom'.

The Cabinet Mission reached Delhi on 24th March, 1946. The objective of the Mission was to help India for achieving freedom as early as possible. The Mission spent nearly three weeks in discussion with the representatives of the various political parties. Bringing the Congress and the Muslim League closer was the greatest act of the Cabinet Mission.

Although, in the beginning, both the Congress as well as Muslim League accepted the Cabinet Mission, but the Congress did not like the Interim Government Plan. The Muslim League claimed that they were capable to form the interim government without the Congress. The Viceroy turned down this claim. Jinnah got a jolt by this action. When Jinnah noticed that the position of the League in the Constituent Assembly was weak, he rejected the Cabinet Mission Plan on 9th June, 1946, threatening direct action on 16th August, 1946 for the creation of Pakistan.

The Congress Working Committee passed a resolution on 8th August, 1946 accepting the Cabinet Mission's Plan for the establishment of Interim Government. Jawaharlal Nehru tried his best to persuade Jinnah to join the interim government but Jinnah was adamant on his point. On 24th August, 1946, the Viceroy announced the formation of the 14-member Cabinet of the Interim Government of India. Nehru was sworn-in as the Prime Minister of the Interim Government. This government had to take responsibility of administration on 2nd September, 1946. Later, Jinnah also had agreed to join the government on the advice of Viceroy on October 1946. Government of India Act and Establishment of the Provincial Governments: After the end of the third session of the Round Table Conference, the British Government issued a White Paper, based on which the Government of India Act 1935 was passed. Although, this Act failed to please either the Congress or the Muslim League, both

the organizations took part in the 1937 provincial elections. The Congress gained

majority in these elections. The difference between the Congress and the Muslim League surfaced at the time of forming the governments after these elections. Jinnah tried his best to make the Muslim League a party which represented the Muslims. Jinnah was of the view that the Congress would seek the help of the Muslim League in forming the government in the Provinces where the Congress had not secured majority. On the other hand, the Congress was ready to include the Muslim League in the government either in the Provinces where the Congress was in majority, but there was only one condition that the Muslim League should leave its stand as a separate organization, but the Muslim League was not ready to do so and the Congress did not include it in the government. The Congress formed its governments in the six Provinces where it has gained majority. The Congress also succeeded in forming the government in North West Frontier Province, Assam and Sind with the support of other parties excluding the Muslim League. Jinnah got frustrated. The Muslim League succeeded in joining the governments in Bengal and Punjab with the help of Praja Party and the Unionists respectively. Jinnah blamed the Congress by saying "The Congress is responsible for making the Muslims more opponents". Now, Jinnah had only one aim – criticize the Congress on every issue.

- Sikander Jinnah Pact: Lucknow Meeting of the Muslim League was held in 1937. An agreement was drawn between Jinnah and Sir Sikander Hayat Khan, the Chief Minister of Punjab, this agreement is known as the Sikander – Jinnah Pact. According to this Pact, it was agreed that the members of the Unionist Party would be granted the membership of the Muslim League but the ministry would be called as the Ministry of the Unionist Party. It was not a written agreement; it was just an announcement. Both had their selfish ends. Sikander wanted to avoid the opposition by the Muslim League and Jinnah wanted that Muslim League, somehow, should have some effective existence in Punjab. The new Muslim League in Punjab was thus recognized in 1938.
- Pirpur Committee: The Muslim League constituted a Committee to look into the incidents of violence on the Muslims. This Committee was known as the Pirpur Committee and it was headed by Raja Mehandi. The Committee published the 'Bihar Sharif Report and the Fazl-ul-Haq Report'.

India – The Parliamentary Secular Democratic Republic: The Indian National Movement for Independence has given clear message to the British that they would not be able to continue ruling over this nation for a long time. Consequently, they finally decided to transfer the power to the Indians granting them the right to independence. In England, the Labour Party come in majority winning the elections held there after the end of the Second World War. The new British Prime Minister, Sir Attlee sent his Cabinet Mission to India in 1946 to discuss their conditions for the transfer of power.

According to his Plan, provisions were made for framing the Constitution of India and forming an Interim Government. A Constitution Committee was elected in July, 1946, which was made responsible for drafting the Constitution of India. The first meeting of the Constitution Committee was held on 9th December, 1946 under the Chairmanship of oldest member of the House, Dr. Sachidananda Sinha. Mahatma Gandhi did not accept its membership of any of the Committees.

#### **Indian Independence Act, 1947**

After the Cripps Mission failed in 1942, the British made one more effort in 1946 to transfer power as smoothly as possible to a united successor state. Accordingly, the Cabinet Mission arrived in India in 1946 under a directive from the Labour Prime Minister, Sir Attlee, to try and achieve the impossible. Surprisingly, it almost did. India was to be divided into three categories of States with the right to secede enshrined in the new Constitution, according to its proposal. Both the Congress and the Muslim league accepted the offer in principle.

The election to the Constituent Assembly was held in July, 1946 under the Cabinet Mission Plan. However, after the elections were over, the Muslim League refused to cooperate with the Congress in the Constituent Assembly. As a result thereof, the political situation in the country deteriorated and commenced countrywide communal riots. The Muslim League demanded a separate Constituent Assembly for Muslim India. On 3rd June, 1947, Lord Louis Mountbatten, the last British Governor-General of India, announced his Plan for scrapping the Cabinet Mission Plan and partitioning of the country into India and Pakistan. The Mountbatten Plan was finally accepted by the two leading parties in India and also the British Government.

Accordingly, the Indian Independence Act was passed by the British Parliament on 18th July, 1947 providing for the setting up a Dominion of India and Dominion of Pakistan on 15th August, 1947 and made them independent and free. Thus, power was transferred to the Indian hands on 15th August, 1947. Sovereignty of the British Parliament over these territories and the paramountcy of the British over the Indian States lapsed. As a result, the British Empire in India ceased to exist. Ever since then, 15th August is celebrated as India's Independence Day.

The main Provisions of the Indian Independence Act, 1947 are as follows:

New Dominions: The Act set up two Dominions – India and Pakistan – from 15th August, 1947. Article 2 of the Act determined the territories of the two Dominions. The Pakistan Dominion was to consist of Baluchistan, Sind, West Punjab, North West Frontier Province (NWFP), and East Bengal, including Sylhet district of Assam. The remaining parts of British India were to constitute the Indian Dominion.

The fate of NWFP was to be decided by a referendum before 15th August, 1947 whether it was to join Pakistan or not. Similarly, a referendum was to be held in the Sylhet district of Assam and if the majority of votes cast went in favour of its joining Pakistan, it would form a part of East Bengal. The exact boundaries of these Provinces – West Punjab and East Bengal, including Sylhet – were to be determined by a Boundary Commission to be appointed by the Governor General. Till then these were to consist of the Muslim majority districts in Punjab and Bengal Provinces, respectively.

- Governor-General: The Act provided that for each Dominion, "there shall be a Governor-General to be appointed by His Majesty for the purpose of the governance of the Dominion". The same person, unless the Legislature of each of these dominions passed a law otherwise, could be a Governor-General of both the Dominions.
- Legislatures: Until a new Constitution was framed for each Dominion, the Act made the existing Constituent Assemblies the Dominion Legislatures for the time being. The Dominion Legislatures were given full powers to make laws for their Dominions. They could pass laws having extra territorial operation. They could repeal or amend any Act of the British Parliament if the same was not in the interests of the Dominion concerned. No Act of the British Parliament in future shall extend to a Dominion unless it was extended by the law of the Legislature of the Dominion concerned.
- Temporary Provisions as to the Government of each Dominion: The Constituent Assembly of each Dominion was to act as Legislature of that dominion. Also it was to exercise powers for framing the Constitution of the Dominion. Except in so far as the Constituent Assembly enacted laws, each Dominion was to be governed so far as possible in accordance with the Government of India Act, 1935. However, discretionary and individual judgement powers of the Governor-General and Governors under that Act were to lapse. Similarly, no bills of the Provincial Assemblies could be reserved for the assent of His Majesty's pleasure. Nor could His Majesty disallow a Provincial Law any more.
- Indian States: The sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian States lapsed with effect from 15th August, 1947. Along with this, the treaties and agreements between His Majesty and the Indian States also lapsed. All authority, powers, rights or jurisdiction exercisable by His Majesty in relation to these States and all obligations and functions of His Majesty in relation thereto, also lapsed. The States, thus, became sovereign entities. The States were given the freedom, if they so wished, to join India or Pakistan, or to remain as independent entities.
- Tribal Areas: As in the case of Indian States, the treaties and agreements between His Majesty and any person having authority in the tribal areas lapsed; and so did the obligations, rights and functions of His Majesty under such agreements and treaties.
- Abolition of the Office of Secretary of State for India: The Office of the Secretary of State for India and his advisory board were abolished and instead the Secretary of Commonwealth Relations was to handle matters between the Dominions and Great Britain.
- British Monarch was no longer Emperor of India: The title 'Emperor of India' was deleted from the Royal style of the British Monarch.

Miscellaneous: The other Provisions of the Act dealt with the Civil Services, the Armed Forces, the British Forces in India, etc. The rights and privileges of the Civil Services were protected. Provision was made for the division of the Armed Forces and retention of the authority and jurisdiction of His Majesty over the British Forces stationed on the territories of India and Pakistan.

#### **Making or Framing of Indian Constitution**

World War II in Europe came to an end on 9th May, 1945. In July, a new Government came to power in the United Kingdom. The new British Government announced its Indian policy and decided to convene a Constitution Drafting Body. Three British Cabinet members were sent to find a solution to the question of India's Independence. This team of Ministers was called the Cabinet Mission. The Cabinet Mission discussed the framework of the Constitution and laid down in some detail the procedure to be followed by the Constitution Drafting Body.

The Constitution of India was drawn up by a Constituent Assembly (established in accordance with the Cabinet Mission Plan) initially summoned on 9th December, 1946, under the Presidentship of Sachidananda Sinha, for undivided India in the Constitution Hall (now it is called as Central Hall of Parliament House). On 1st July, 1947, the British Parliament passed the 'Indian Independence Act', to divide into India and Pakistan. With the partition of India, the representatives of East Bengal, West Punjab, Sind and Baluchistan, NWFP and the Sylhet district of Assam, which joined Pakistan, ceased to be members of the Constituent Assembly.

On 14th August, 1947, the Constituent Assembly met again as the Sovereign Constituent Assembly for the dominion of India under the Presidentship of Mr. Sinha. On the demise of Mr. Sinha, Dr. Rajendra Prasad became the President of the Constituent Assembly (11th December, 1946). A Draft Constitution was published in February, 1948. 284 out of 299 members appended their signature to the Constitution and finally adopted it on 26th November, 1949. It came to effect on 26th January, 1950. The Constituent Assembly took almost three years (two years, eleven months and eighteen days to be precise) to complete its historic task of Drafting the Constitution for Independent India. During this period, it held eleven sessions covering a total of 166 days. Of these, 114 days were spent on the consideration of the Draft Constitution. Its sessions were open to the press and the public. NOTE: The Constituent Assembly was elected by indirect election by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assemblies under a scheme formulated by the Cabinet Mission. The Constitutional Adviser to the Assembly Sir B. N. Rau prepared a Draft Constitution in October 1947. It contained 243 Articles and 13 Schedules. A Drafting Committee was elected by the Constituent Assembly on 29th August, 1947. It elected Dr. B. R. Ambedkar to be its President. The Constitution as prepared by the Drafting Committee was circulated on 21st February, 1948. This formed the basis of discussion in and outside the Constituent Assembly. It contained 315 Articles and 8 Schedules and was introduced on 4th November, 1948 by Dr. Ambedkar. The total number of amendments to the Draft Constitution tabled was 7635 and while 2473 amendments were actually moved in the Assembly.

#### **The Indian Constitution Framers**

The Union Jack fluttered atop Constitution Hall in Delhi on that winter day. Inside, the Constituent Assembly was in session. It was just past noon on 19th December, 1946 when Smt. Dakshayani Velayudan started her address, "Mr. Chairman, before express my views on the Resolution, let me pay my humble homage to our Revolutionary Father, Mahatma Gandhi. It is his mystic vision, his political idealism and his social passion that gave us the instruments to achieve our goal".

Sixty years since that speech was made, similar invocations of Gandhi, Nehru and other well-known leaders continue across places of learning, on community grounds and in elite circles across India. People discuss their virtues and some debate their actions. Names such as Sir B. N. Rau and Sri Saiyad Mohammed Saadulla do not evoke emotion among most Indians, although their work is often a subject of study by constitutional scholars. Indian Constitution, drafted by end of 1949, was an attempt by a nation to base its governance on laws and principles, a radical departure from a tradition of centuries when rajahs and plunderers forced their will on the masses.

The work on the framing of the Indian Constitution started well before Independence. On 19th December, 1946, when the first meeting of the Constituent Assembly was held, Dr. Sachchidananda Sinha, the Chairman of the Assembly, conveyed the gravity of the mission by saying, "My prayer is that the Constitution that you are going to plan may similarly be reared for 'Immortality', if the work of man may justly aspire to such a title, and it may be a structure of adamantine strength, which will outlast and overcome all present and future destructive forces". Thereafter, the Assembly let a core group of its members take the lead in the drafting of the Constitution.

The following are list of 'fourteen forgotten framers' of Indian Constitution:

- Sri M. A. Ayyangar: He represented Madras and was a prominent Member of the Steering Committee and went on to become the Speaker of Lok Sabha.
- Dewan Bahadur N. Gopalswami Ayyangar: He represented Madras and was a Member of the Rules, Business, Drafting and several other Committees. He went on to become a Minister in the Government.
- Dewan Bahadur Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar: He represented Madras and was a Member of the Rules, Drafting, Union Powers and several other Committees.
- Sri Jairamdas Daulatram: He represented East Punjab and was a Member of the Advisory, Union Subjects, and Provincial Constitutional Committees. He went on to become the Governor of Assam.
- Sri Shankar Rao Dattatraya Deo: He represented Bombay and was a Member of the Minorities, and the Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee; besides, he actively participated in several other Advisory Committees.
- Smt. G. Durgabai: She represented Madras and a Member of the Steering and Rules Committees.
- Sri T. T. Krishnamachari: He represented Madras and a Member of the Drafting Committee. He was a businessman who went on to become a Minister in the Government.

- Sri H. C. Mukherjee: He represented Bengal and was Vice President of the Assembly and Member of the Minority Rights Sub-Committee and Provincial Constitution Committee. He went on to become Governor of Bengal.
- Sri K. M. Munshi: He represented Bombay and was one of the most prominent members of the Assembly. He was a Member of several Committees including the Rules, Steering and Advisory Committees. He went on to become a Minister in the Government and then the Governor of Uttar Pradesh.
- Sri N. Madhava Rau: He represented Orissa and was a Member of the Drafting Committee.
- Sri Saiyad Mohammed Saadulla: He represented Assam and was a Member of the Steering and Drafting Committees.
- Sri Satyanarayan Sinha: He represented Bihar and was a Member of the Steering Committee and the Provincial Constitution Committee. He went to become the Minister of Parliamentary Affairs.
- Sri B. Pattabhi Sitaramayya: He represented Madras and was a Member of the Rules, States, Union Subjects and Provincial Constitution Committees. He went on to become the Governor of Madhya Pradesh.
- Sir Benegal Narsing Rau: Dr. Rajendra Prasad, before signing the Constitution on 26th November, 1949, thanked him for having 'worked honorarily all the time that he was here, assisting the Assembly not only with his knowledge and erudition but also enabled the other members to perform their duties with thoroughness and intelligence by supplying them with the material on which they could work'. He was not a Member of the Assembly but was perhaps as important in the framing of the Constitution as Dr. Ambedkar himself. He was also represented India at the United Nations.

#### **Draft Constitution by Drafting Committee**

The work started with the presentation of the 'Objective Resolution' moved on 13th December, 1946 by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and was adopted on 22nd January, 1947. The Committee for scrutinizing the Draft Constitution and suggesting Amendments was formed on 29th August, 1947. The Draft was readied by February, 1948. The Constituent Assembly met thrice to read the Draft clause-by-clause in November, 1948, October, 1949 and November, 1949. After the third reading, it was signed by the President and adopted on 26th November, 1949. In fact, a Committee on Rules of Procedure was in place as early as December, 1946 under the Chairmanship of Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar and Members were: Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar, N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar, Dr. K. M. Munshi, Syed Md. Saadulla, B. L. Mitter (was replaced by N. Madhava Rao) and D. P. Khaitan (was replaced by T. T. Krishnamachari).

The Drafting Committee studied the Constitutions of number of countries like France, Canada, USA, Switzerland, etc. and gathered the best features and adopted them for the realization of the aspirations of the people of India in our Constitution. The result of it was that we have one of the best Constitutions of the world today. The Indian Constitution closely follows the British Parliamentary Model but differs from it; the Constitution is Supreme, not Parliament. So the Indian Courts are vested with the authority to adjudicate on the constitutionality of any law passed by the Parliament. Few like,

- British Constitution
  - Parliamentary form of Government
  - The Idea of Single Citizenship
  - The Idea of the Rule of Law
  - Institution of Speaker and his/her Role

The Constitution has provided Provisions and the Procedures for the Amendment. The Parliament only can amend laws in the Constitution. Parliament has powers to make new Provisions or to cancel the Provisions which are against the welfare of the public and can even correct the Provisions, which are known as Amendments.

The Constitution consists of the following: (1) The Preamble; (2) Parts / Chapters I to XXII covering Articles / Clauses 1 to 395; (3) Schedules 1 to 8 and (4) An Appendix and totaling some 1,17,369 words in its English language version. Today, it has XXVI Parts, 445 Articles and 12 Schedules and has undergone 92 Amendments.

On 26th January, 1950, the Constitution of Independent India was adopted. The Constitution declared India as a Republic. This day is observed every year as the Republic Day and celebrated as National Festival. As provided in the Constitution, the first General elections were held during 1951-52. And the first elected body (Parliament) with TWO Houses, namely, Rajya Sabha (RS) and Lok Sabha (LS), came into existence in May, 1952.

IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do HEREBY ADOPT, ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION.

## **The Preamble of Our Constitution**

It has great significance / importance that we should try to understand it.

- The Preamble begins with "We, the People of India" which means that the Constitution derives its authority from the people of India. So the ultimate source of all power is vested in the people. The sovereignty of the nation belongs to the people.
- Before Independence, we were under the British Rule. The Queen of Britain was the Sovereign Head of the State and we had no power to make law. Now the President is the Head of our State / Nation and the Sovereign power belonging to the State / Nation is vested in our Parliament, which represents the people of India, who are the masters of their own destiny. SOVEREIGN means the independent authority of the State. It means that it has the power to legislate on any subject; and that it is not subject to the control of any other State or External Power. That means, the word 'Sovereign' means supreme or independent. India is internally and externally sovereign - externally free from the control of any foreign power and internally, it has a free government which is directly elected by the people and makes laws that govern the people.
- The word 'SOCIALIST' was added to the Preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. It implies social and economic equality. Social equality in this context means the absence of discrimination on the grounds of caste, colour, creed, sex, religion, language, etc. Under social equality, everyone has equal status and opportunities. Economic equality means that the government will endeavor to make the distribution of wealth more equal and provide a decent standard of living for all. India has adopted a mixed economy and the government has framed many laws to achieve the aim of socialism, such as the Abolition of Untouchability and Zamindari, The Equal Wages Act and The Child Labour Prohibition Act.
- The word 'SECULAR' was inserted into the preamble by the 42nd Amendment Act of 1976. Ours is Secular, which means that the State has no official religion. Here, all

religions are equal. The freedom to follow any religion is guaranteed by the Constitution. Every person has the right to preach, practice and propagate any religion they choose. The government must not favour or discriminate against any religion. It must treat all religions with equal respect. All citizens, irrespective of their religious beliefs are equal in the eyes of law. No religious instruction is imparted in government or aided schools.

- India is a DEMOCRACY. The people of India elect their governments at all levels (Union, State and Local) by a system of Universal Adult Franchise. Every citizen of India, who is 18 years of age and above and not otherwise debarred by law, is entitled to vote. Every citizen enjoys this right without any discrimination on the basis of caste, creed, colour, sex, religion or education. Elections are conducted once in FIVE years to elect our representatives or Head of the State (President) and the Executive. The various policies of the State are decided by them.
- As opposed to a monarchy, in which the Head of the State is appointed on hereditary basis for a lifetime or until he abdicates from the throne, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC is an entity in which the Head of the State is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure. The President of India is elected by an Electoral College for a term of five years. It means a Government of the people, by the people and for the people (Abraham Lincoln - famous speech at Gettysberg).
- Our Constitution has upheld Equality. So, there is no scope for inequality based on race, religion, language, sex, etc. practice of Untouchability is prohibited and it a crime.
- Our Constitution assures freedom to one and all. No one is arrested without the consent of law. All laws are equal and all are equal before law.
- Our Constitution assures us the Justice: Social, economic and political through various measures of laws; and there is no scope for exploitation of weaker sections of the society or women. Social justice means that the state will treat all citizens as equal and will not discriminate between them on the basis of religion, caste, gender, race, status or place of birth. Economic justice means that the state will attempt to reduce the economic disparities between rich and the poor and will try to bring about equality in incomes. Political justice means that the state assures all people equal opportunities to participate in political activities.
- Barker calls FRATERNITY as principle of cooperation. It includes a bunch of right to share and enjoy the common resources and services of the Nation, like, education, police, health and other services.

## **Types of Government**

There is also a proposal to allocate 33% seats in all elections to women candidates, currently there is no consensus in how to implement it and which seats should be allocated. The pillar of Indian Democracy is Election Commission of India; it is one of the most trusted organizations and has been praised by all for conducting free and fair elections.
- Republic: As opposed to a monarchy, in which the Head of State is appointed on hereditary basis for a lifetime, or until he abdicates, a Republic is a State in which the Head of State is elected, directly or indirectly, for a fixed tenure.

## **Purpose of the Preamble**

- It indicates the source from which the Constitution came i.e., THE PEOPLE OF INDIA.
- It declares the rights and freedom which are assured to all the citizens of the country.

## **Different Models in the World**

India is the biggest democracy in the world. No doubt that we have democratic system of administration for the last over fifty years. Today, there are TWO types of democracies in the world. One is direct as in Switzerland; and the other is indirect or representative form of government. In Direct democracy (City of Athens in Ancient Greece), all the people would assemble at a place and through mutual and direct discussions, decided the policies. In Indirect democracy, the formation of government is by the representatives.

India has adopted the British model of Parliamentary form of Government. But, we have no crown as the Head of the State and we have a written Republican Constitution. Further, both India and United States of America are democratic in their system. But United States of America is having a Presidential form of government, while India is having a Parliamentary form of Government. Also, there are different kinds of democracies. For example, in Pakistan, they have a 'Guided Democracy' which is subjected to military administration. Our next neighbors i.e. Myanmar (Burma) and Sri Lanka also have different type of democracies. Former Soviet Union and the present peoples China have what is called as "People's Democracy", but in practice they are totalitarian. In the next place, we find constitutional monarchies in Japan and England but they are fully democratic.

### **Basic Structure of the Constitution**

- 1. Federal Structure: Federal The Constitution of India is based on a federal structure. That it is to say there exists both State and Central forms of Governments. But though it has federal structure, it is also has some unitary features. That is the Central Government is the Supreme Law making authority in the country.
- 2. Supremacy of the Constitution: emacy the All the authorities derive their powers, rights, duties and obligations from the Constitution.
- 3. Distribution of Powers: Distribution of Powers: The distribution of power for running the country effectively has been done on the Principle of 'Doctrine of Separation of Power'. As the wordings are there 'power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely'. The distribution has been done in the following basis:
  - Legislature to make / enact the laws
  - Executive to implement the laws (constitutes of government machinery like police, public servants, etc.)
  - Judiciary to interpret / enforce the laws

#### **Some Concepts of Indian Constitution**

Unitary and Federal Structure: In the Unitary style, all powers are concentrated on the Center. Due to the coordination in the decision making, this type performs better and has higher efficiency. It is best suited for smaller countries and less populous ones like France, etc.

In Federal style, powers are divided between the Central Government and the State Governments. This is best suited for larger countries like India, etc. with great, cultural and ethnic diversity.

- Residual Powers: In the Federal Polity, powers are divided between the Union and State Governments. The powers which are not mentioned in the Constitution are called 'Residual powers'. The Indian Constitution has accorded these powers to the Union Government.
- Article 370: The Princely State of Jammu & Kashmir (J & K) was integrated with the Indian Union under Article 370. It ensures special provisions for J & K which are not the prerogative of the other States.
- Election Commission: In order to conduct free and fair elections, the Constitution provides for independent machinery known as "The Election Commission". To

conduct elections for the Parliament and State Legislatures, of President and Vice President and to keep vigil over the whole process of election is the main function of the Election Commission of India. The Chief Election Commissioner and the member Commissioners are appointed by the President of India. The Chief Election Commissioner can be impeached and then removed from his post only on the grounds of misbehavior or inefficiency.

- Public Service Commission: The Constitution provides for the "Union Public Service Commission" and the "State Public Service Commissions" for recruiting intelligent, responsible, conscientious and honest administrative officers. In short, they should be person of sound character, good social deportment, integrity as well as merit.
- Ordinance: The Executive (The Ministry) has to face all of a sudden, conditions of calamity or emergency. Under such circumstances, the President at the Center and the Governors at the State level, issues Ordinances. But an Ordinance can remain in force for maximum six weeks from the day of beginning of the session of the Parliament. It is sort of temporary legislation, a make-shift but an absolutely necessary measure to ensure the stability and security of the country.
- Constituency: In order to elect the representatives of people, constituencies have to be properly demarcated. One constituency can return (elect) only one representative. More than one member is elected from majority of the constituencies. In India, candidates are elected by a simple majority. The candidate, who wins the majority of votes, is declared duly elected. A voter casts his vote only for one candidate. Therefore, in India, there are one-member constituencies. Only one candidate is elected from one constituency. Some seats are reserved in the Parliament and State Legislatures for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. For such reserved constituencies, only the candidates of Scheduled Castes and Tribes are elected.
- The Ministry (The Cabinet): A Cabinet Minister has a top-ranking status. The other sensitive and utterly important ministries such as those of Defence, Human Resources Development, Planning, etc. are divided among various ministries and departments. The Cabinet Minister is entrusted with the functions of special importance. Ministers of State have a second-rank status in the ministry. The Minister of State is given independent charge of one ministry or department. A Deputy Minister assists the Cabinet Minister and the Minister of State as well.
- The Principle of Collective Responsibility: The Ministry functions on the basis of Collective Responsibility. Coordination in the policies is a pre-requisite for the smooth functioning of a Ministry. It is a norm that either a Minister has to fall in line with all the policies of the Ministry or is free to resign from the Ministry. If a Minister had committed a serious blunder in the discharge of the duties and in the implementation of the policies, he / she has to perforce to accept full responsibility and has to tender the resignation with immediate effect.
- Privileges of the Member of Parliament: Special privileges have been conferred on the members of Parliament so as to enable them to discharge their duties without any hindrance. They enjoy the immunity from arrest when Parliament is in session. They cannot be arrested 40 days before or after the session of the Parliament. But

this immunity is restricted to civil cases only. They enjoy no immunity against criminal offence or prohibitive law arrest. But, in case, any Member of Parliament is arrested, this arrest and the nature of the offence committed must be immediately reported to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of Rajya Sabha as the case may be. Besides, without obtaining prior permission of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, they cannot be arrested.

- The Constitutional Bill: It can originate in any House of the Parliament.
- Adjournment Motion: The proceedings of the House go according to the agenda. If a subject that is not on the agenda but it is of urgent public interest, then with the permission of the Speaker that subject is taken up for the immediate discussion.
- Attention Motion: There are rules on the functioning of the House. Honorable members with prior permission from the Speaker or President can set an attention motion to draw the attention of the concerned Minister. This motion is called Attention Motion.
- Motion of Censure: It is a resolution passed by a simple majority to censure the government, its unsuccessful policies, or misbehavior of a Minister of any member of the House. In parliamentary democracy, if such resolution is passed against the government or Minister, it is taken as the passing of a no confidence motion against the government.

#### **Schedules**

Schedules can be added to the Constitution by Amendment. The 12 Schedules in force covers: The Designations of the States and Union Territories; Emoluments for high-level Officials; Forms of Oaths / Affirmations; Allocation of the number of seats in the Rajya Sabha (Council of States – the Upper House of the Parliament) per State or Union Territory; Provisions for the Administration and control of Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes (areas and tribes needing special Protection due to disadvantageous conditions); Provisions for the Administration of tribal areas in Assam; The Union (Central) Government, State, and Concurrent (dual) Lists of Responsibilities; The Official Languages; Land and Tenure reforms; The Association of Sikkim with India; Anti-defection Provisions for Members of Parliament and Members of the State Legislatures; Rural Development; and Urban Planning.

#### **Amendment of the Constitution**

Nothing may remain static in the world. Nature demands change. A political society undergoes changes with the passage of time. To face new problems and challenges changes and modifications are called for in all aspects of national life. Just as the education system gets a new look, the industrial policy changes to serve the needs of the society, changes are required to be made in the laws and in the Constitution.

Our Constitution is a written Constitution which is federal in character. Some parts of it can be amended by simple legislation while other parts are less flexible and require special majority. Some parts of the Constitution may be amended with the consent of the States.

Amending Process: It may be of two types –

The Imperceptible or Informal Process: The Informal Process: This process is for changing the Constitution as a limited role for supplementing the Constitution. Such changes can be effected by –

- The Courts by interpretation Changes brought by judicial interpretation give a new or altered meaning without changing the text of the Constitution. The language of the Constitution remains the same but in view of the prevailing circumstances and needs of the society, the Courts give a new import to the words. Judicial interpretation is a very slow process.
- Changes in conventions and constitutional changes Conventions may sometime make a provision of the Constitution ineffective. A convention operates within the framework of the Constitution yet it effects and modifies it. The relation of the President with his / her Council of Ministers, exercise of veto by the President, assent to Bills by the President or the Governor, acceptance of the recommendations of the Finance Commission and Union Public Service Commission, the role of the Planning Commission are all governed and guided by conventions.
- Legislation by filling gaps or supplementing the Constitution.
- The Perceptible or Formal Process: or Formal Process: Every Constitution contains a description of the manner in which it may be changed. This involves changing the text of the Constitution to make it reflect the new meanings required by the changes in the society or for development of the nation. The formal process is visible. It is announced and overt process of change. It is the most accepted way of adapting the Constitution to face new developments. Our Constitution attaches different degrees of rigidity to different provisions of the Constitution. Such provisions are of three types –
  - By simple majority of the Parliament: Here, Amendments can be made by a simple majority of members present and voting, before it sending it for the President's assent.
  - By special majority of the Parliament: Here, Amendments can be made by a twothird majority of the total number of members present and voting which should not be less than the majority of the total membership of the House.
  - By special majority of the Parliament and ratification of at least half of the State Legislatures by special majority. After this, it is sent to the President for his assent.

An Amendment to the Constitution is taken very seriously, and needs at least two-thirds of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha to pass it. Thus, the Constitution of India is one of most frequently amended Constitutions in the World.

The Amending Procedure: Article 368 contains the procedure to be followed to amend the Constitution. The following is the procedure:

- The Amendment is initiated by introducing a Bill for the purpose
- The Bill may be introduced in either House of Parliament (A Money Bill or a Financial Bill may be introduced only in the Lok Sabha)
- The Bill must be passed by each House by special majority (2/3rd present and voting and more than 50% of the total membership)

- In case of entrenched (unamendable) provisions, the Bill must be ratified by not less than one half of the State Legislatures
- After being duly passed and ratified, where so required, the Bill is presented to the President
- The President is bound to give assent to it (in case of an Ordinary Bill, the President may send the Bill for reconsideration or withhold the assent)
- In case of disagreement between the Houses there is no provision for joint sitting. It must be passed by each House sitting separately.
- The Bill does not require previous sanction of the President before introduction.

#### **Basic Principles of the Constitution of India**

If the division of power is the basis of civilized government, a Constitution is the best device by which such division could be facilitated. Constitutionalism is an achievement of a modern world. But it is a comparatively recent achievement. As such, it has not become fully stabilized. The oldest written Constitution of the world is that of the United States of America which is only a little over two hundred years old. Every Constitution however aims at building up a governmental structure based upon certain principles. A careful study of the Constitution will show that there are at least eight basic principles which are embodied in it and which form the foundation of the Political System in India. These are: Popular Sovereignty; Socialism; Secularism; Fundamental Rights; Directive Principles of State Policy; Judicial Independence; Federalism; and Cabinet Government.

- Popular Sovereignty: The Constitution proclaims the sovereignty of the people in its Preamble. Article 326 declares that 'the election to the House of People and to the Legislative Assembly of every State shall be on the basis of adult suffrage'. As a result, the Government at the Center and in the States derives their authority from the people who choose their representatives for Parliament and the State Legislatures at regular intervals. This is the principle of popular sovereignty. In fact, the voter ensures the democratic ideal of "one man, one vote, one value", irrespective of his wealth, education, social status and importance.
- Socialism: Socialism:Socialism: Increasing intervention as well as participation by the State in the economic field has been a distinguishing feature of the twentieth century. There is hardly any country today in which the State is not actively engaged in a variety of economic activities. In varying degrees, governments everywhere are involved in economic, industrial and commercial management. This is broadly described as the influence of socialist ideas on the State activity. The 42nd Amendment (1976) went a step further and amended the Preamble of the Constitution to include specifically the term 'socialist' which was absent in the original form in which it was enacted.
- Secularism: The Constitution aims to establish a secular State. And a secular State means in essence that the State will not make any discrimination whatsoever on the ground of religion or community against any person professing any particular form of religious faith. No particular religion in the State will be identified as State religion nor will it receive any State patronage of preferential status. The State will not establish any State religion; nor will the State accord any preferential treatment to

any citizen or discriminate against him simply on the ground that he professes a particular form of religion.

- Fundamental Rights: Fundamental The Constitution affirms the basic principle that every individual is entitled to enjoy certain rights as a human being and the enjoyment of such rights does not depend upon the will of any majority and minority. No majority has the right to abrogate such rights. In fact, the legitimacy of the majority to rule is derived from the existence of these rights. These rights include all the basic liberties such as freedom of speech, movement and association, equality before law and equal protection of laws, freedom of religious belief, and cultural and educational freedoms.
- Directive Principles: Principles: These are assurances to the people as to what they can expect from the State and, on the other, are directives to the Central and State Governments, to establish and maintain a new, "social order in which justice, social, economic and political, shall inform all the institutions of national life". The State shall in particular, direct its policy towards securing (a) that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood; (b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to sub-serve the common good; (c) that the operation of the economic system, does not result in the concentration of wealth and the means of production to the common detriment; (d) that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women; (e) that the health and strength of workers, men and women; and the tender age of children are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength; (f) that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment.
- Judicial Independence: Independence: The judicial function is indeed a delicate and difficult one. It involves the process of deciding what is just in a controversy between two or more contending parties. If the parties have no confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary, justice becomes an empty word. Man's long struggle has been to live under a government of laws, not of men. Equal justice under law has for long been his cherished ideal, a system under which the same law is applicable to all alike. In fact, the judicial process ceases to be judicial the moment those who seek to judge cease to be independent of every form of external influence, hence the importance of judicial independent.
- Federalism: Federalism: It is one of the most important aspects of modern constitutionalism. It is established all over the world perhaps, as the only form of political organization suited to communities with a diversified pattern of objectives, interests, and traditions, who seek to join together in the pursuit of common objectives and interests and the cultivation of common traditions. The basic objective of federalism is thus unity in diversity, devolution in authority and decentralization in administration. Its fundamental characteristic is the division of powers between the two sets of governments – a Central and State or Local governments – each independent of the other in its own sphere of activity. The framers of the Constitution turned to federalism as a solution of a number of problems they confronted in their attempt to frame a Constitution for new, united India. Particularly, they wanted to preserve both the "infinite variety and the innate unity" that animated the length and breadth of India.

The choice of federalism as a constitutional form and as the basis of a national government in India was not sudden development upon the transfer of power on 15th August, 1947. It was there for many years and, in a limited form, it was already in operation in British India. For the solution of the constitutional problem of a multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-communal country in India with a vast area and a huge population, federalism was only a natural choice. Nevertheless, the framers were cautious to ensure that the unity they sought to establish through federalism was of an abiding nature, and in the case of future conflict between that unity and the diversity preserved under the Constitution, the former should prevail over the latter. In other words, it was their intention to create an indestructible Union and the supremacy of the Union over the States in a number of matters vitally affecting the interests of the nation.

Cabinet Government: The most distinctive characteristic of a Cabinet system of Government is the complete and continuous responsibility of the Executive to the Legislature. The Cabinet is composed of the Prime Minister who is Chief of the Executive, and his senior colleagues who share the responsibility with him for the formulation and execution of the policies of the government. The Cabinet is the central shaft to which all the other agencies of government are geared. Individual members of the Cabinet are the Heads of the different departments of the administration. Collectively, the Cabinet shapes the programme of legislation which is submitted to the Parliament and from it emanates the broad and general policies. The Parliament also checks and controls the performance of the administration. Thus, the Cabinet system facilitates the intimate cooperation between the Executive and the Legislature, the representative of the people.

Under the Cabinet system, the Head of the State occupies a position of great dignity, but practically all authority, nominally vested in him, is exercised by the Cabinet or Ministry which assumes full responsibility for acts performed in his name. The unity and collective responsibility of the Cabinet are achieved through the Prime Minister, who is the keystone of the Cabinet arch. His colleagues in the Cabinet are appointed on his recommendation and they always go out of office along with him. Thus he is central both to the formation and dissolution of the Cabinet.

In India, the Cabinet system of Government under the Constitution is established not only at the Central level, but also in the States. In every State, there is a Council of Ministers headed by a Chief Minister, just like the Prime Minister who heads the Central Cabinet.
