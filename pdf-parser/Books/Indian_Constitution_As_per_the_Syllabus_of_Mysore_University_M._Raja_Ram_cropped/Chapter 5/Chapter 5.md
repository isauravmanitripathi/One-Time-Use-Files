# IMPORTANT NOTE: Doctrine of Separation of Powers – Legislature, Executive and Judiciary and their Composition and Functioning in India: Detailed discussion was in Unit - II. Unit II.Unit

## **Features of Indian Federalism**

The basic principle of Federation is that the Legislative and Executive authority is partitioned between the Center and the States not by any law to be made by the Center. This is the principle embodied in Indian Constitution. It is generally regarded that in a Federation governmental functions are shared by the Central or Federal government and the State governments. These two governments are coordinate and independent of each other.

A Federal Constitution generally possesses the following five characteristics:

- Dual or two sets of governments: In a unitary State as the name indicates there is only one government, i.e. the national government. In a federation, two sets of governments co-exist, i.e. the national (or union or central or federal) and state governments. These two governments derive their powers from the same source (the Constitution) and are controlled not by the other but by the Constitution.
- In order to make the distribution clear and permanent, it must be reduced to writing and must be made amendable to amendments and changes by observing the procedure laid down in the Constitution itself.
- Constitution is regarded as a higher law which is there for the Union and States to obey and honour. None of the Units (Union and States) has the authority to override

or disregard the Constitution. In some cases, the Union may have overriding powers but in relation to the divisions of power. Federal Constitutions guard attentively the distribution of powers and do not tolerate encroachments.

- Rigidity does not mean that the Constitution is not subject to any change and must remain in the same static condition. The amending process should lay down as a precondition the concurrence of both. Our Constitution provides amendment by a special majority at the Union followed by at least half of the States.
- In a federation, there is possibility of a State encroaching upon the field of another State. There is also the possibility of the Union trespassing on the rights of one or more States as also the States purporting to exercise the functions of the Union. To take care of such contingencies, a federation contemplates an independent judicial body which will decide the rights of the Units and keep them confined within their limits. The Courts have the last word in regard to questions involving the interpretation of the Constitution.

There are certain provisions contained in the Constitution which are departure from the federal principle or to put it in another way it may be called Indian modification of the federal principle.

- One Constitution for the States In India, the Act of 1935 created autonomous units and forged them into a federation. Both were created by the same Act. Our Constitution has been framed by the people of India and nor by the States. It is not the result of agreement. The American Union was formed by voluntary agreement among a number of sovereign States. The object was to create a national government that would look after their common interest and to attain the objective they surrendered a part of their rights.
- Single citizenship India has like Canada in terms of single citizenship. But United States of America and Australia is having dual citizenship (National and State). Thus in America an American is a citizen not only of a State in which he resides but also of the United States.
- In India, the Union is indissoluble but not so the States. No State can secede. The Union may alter the boundaries of any State, create a new State by separation or merger of two or more States. It may change the name of any State. The process of territorial change can be brought by simple legislation and does not require special majority in the Parliament or consent of the States.
- The distribution of legislative power is done by Articles 245 and 246 read with the 7th Schedule. The Schedule has 3 Lists, the Union List (99 Subjects), the State List (61 Subjects) and the Concurrent List (52 Subjects). All residuary powers are vested in the Union.
- The Union has the power to issue directions to a State to ensure compliance with the laws as per Article 256. On failure to comply with such directions, the President may assume to him / herself all the functions of the Government of that State.
- The Governor of a State is appointed by the President and holds office during his / her pleasure. He / she is not responsible to State. Through him / her, the Center exercises an amount of control (Article 155).

- Where a financial emergency has been proclaimed under Article 360, the power of the Center enlarges. It may even issue directions requiring all Money Bills and some other Bills to be reserved for the consideration of the President.
- The All India Services are created by the Center which alone has the power to regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of the persons appointed to the service. But such persons are paid and serve the State to whose cadre they belong. Thus the Center exercises an amount of control over the State bureaucracy.
- Judges of a State High Court are appointed by the President in consultation with the State Governor and other functionaries.
- An essential feature of American federalism is the equality of representation of the States in the Senate irrespective of their population or size. It is considered to be a safeguard for small States. In India, the membership varies from 1 to 34, depending on the population. Apart from this, 12 members are nominated by the President.

### **Center-State Relations**

India is a federation having a federal Constitution. In a federation, there are two sets of Governments. All powers are divided among them. The Constitution divides all powers between the two – The Union and the States. It is the mark and essential feature of a federal polity that powers are divided and distributed between the Union Government and the States.

The Constitution of India provides for a polity with clearly defined spheres of authority between the Union and the States to be exercised in the fields assigned to them. There is an independent Judiciary to determine issues between the Union and the States or among States to be exercised in fields assigned to them respectively. The Indian Constitution is basically federal in nature though the word 'federation' is nowhere used. The Constitution provides for a unifying central entity holding together a number of constituent units with all their diversity enjoying autonomy in their given sphere. It is a political system with extra authority and responsibilities to the Center in selected matters and many ways.

The Administrative Reforms Commission, the Rajamannar Committee and the Sarkaria Commission all went into the working of the existing consultative mechanisms and assessed the requirements of the prevailing discords and strongly pleaded for setting up of an Inter-State Council with a comprehensive mandate. They have categorically observed that piecemeal departmental bodies have not served the purpose of a truly federating consultative body and that the remedies lies in nothing short of setting up of an Inter-State Council envisaged under Article 263 of the Constitution.

- Administrative Reforms Commission: The report on Center-State Relations submitted in 1969, constituted as per Article 263 to cover problems relating to or arising out of the Constitution, Legislative Enactments, Administration and Finance. It consists of the Prime Minister as Chairman and the Union Home Minister, the Union Finance Minister, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and five representatives, one each from the five Zonal Councils, as Members.
- Rajamannar Committee: A Center-State Relations Inquiry Committee was set up by the then DMK Government of Tamil Nadu on 2nd September, 1969 under the

Chairmanship of Dr. P. V. Rajamannar to consider the entire question regarding relationship that should subsist between the Center and the States in a federal set up. The Committee in its report recommended that 'The Inter-State Council should be constituted immediately' and that "no decision of national importance or which may affect one or more States should be taken by the Union Government except after consultation with the Inter-State Council". The Committee further recommended that "every Bill of national importance or which is likely to affect the interests of one or more States should, before its introduction in Parliament, be referred to the Inter-State Council and its views thereon should be submitted to the Parliament at the time of introduction of the Bill".

- Sarkaria Commission: It went at considerable length into the justification for establishing a permanent Inter-State Council as an independent national forum for consultation with a mandate well defined in accordance with Article 263. It recommended that for coordination of policies and implementation in a dual polity specially in view of large areas of common interest and shared action requires a sustained process of contact, consultation and interaction, for which a proper forum is necessary. It observed that executive powers of the Union and States overlap in many areas and as such division of matters in the Union List and State List is not absolute. Several entries overlap. Then in implementation of its laws and policy, Union is largely dependent on State administrations. Union and States can entrust their executive functions to each other. States are dependent on Union for fiscal resources and in many administrative matters. Interdependence is indispensable in a diverse and developing society. Institutionalized and sustained consultation is indispensable in view of this interdependence. It recommended setting up of a Council under Article 263 of the Constitution for this purpose.
- Miscellaneous Inter-State Consultative Forums: With the growing complexity of problems on Center-State Relations, a few consultative bodies were set up to review the policy and other related matters and to arrive at a consensus on different contentious issues after adoption of the Constitution. While most of these bodies were set up under executive orders, some were constituted under Article 263 of the Constitution:

The bodies, which were set up under the executive orders, are as under:

- National Development Council
- National Water Resources Council
- Indian Labour Conference
- Advisory Council on Food Grains Management and Public Distribution System
- Mineral Advisory Council
- State Programming Board Geological Survey of India
- Drugs Consultative Committee
- Central Advisory Board of Education
- Central Council of Health
- Central Council of Local Self Government

- Council for Sales Tax and State Excise Duties for each of Northern, Eastern, Western, and Southern Zones
- Transport Development Council
- Central Council for Research in Ayurveda, Unani, Homeopathy, Yoga and Nature Cure
- Central Family Welfare Council
- Inter-State Council

The powers which are so shared are generally of four types:

- Legislative Relations
- Administrative / Executive Relations
- Financial Relations
- Judicial Relations

Legislative Relations: The division of legislative powers between the Union and the States is a characteristic of all federal Constitutions though the actual distribution varies from country to country and depends on the historical and political forces operating in the country. But the common factor visible in all Constitutions is that the division is with reference to,

- (a) The territory over which the Union and the States will exercise authority
- (b) The subjects over which their authority will extend

Article 245 defines the territorial limits of the legislative powers vested in the Union and the States. Article 246 defines the powers of the Parliament and the States legislatures with regard to the subject matter or topics of legislation. Parliament may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India. The State Legislature may enact laws for the whole or any part of the State.

Administrative / Executive Relations: It is a delicate balancing act. The national interest is to be balanced with the autonomy of the States. Our Constitution contains detailed provisions to avoid conflict and promote harmony. Articles 256 to 263 provide for Union control over the States even in normal conditions. The Union may give directions to a State,

- To ensure compliance with laws made by the Parliament (Article 256)
- To ensure that the exercise of the Executive power of the State does not interfere with the exercise of the Executive power of the Union (Article 257)
- To ensure construction and maintenance of means of communication of national importance including National Highways and Waterways
- To ensure protection of Railways
- For providing facilities for instructions in mother tongue at primary levels (Article 350A)
- To ensure that every State is run in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution (Article 355)

- To draw and execute schemes relating to welfare of Scheduled Tribes (Article 339)
- Payment by the Union of grants-in-aid of revenues of the States (Article 275)
- The Officers of the All India Services are allotted to a State cadre but are controlled by the Union

Financial Relations: Our Constitution contains detailed provisions allotting financial resources between the Union and the States. It has provided a complex mechanism to make the distribution of financial resources equitable. Care has been taken to ensure that the division is not permanent and for all times but is subject to review and adjustments at regular intervals. The Constitution makes a distinction between power to levy and collect tax and appropriate the tax so collected. Income Tax may be levied and collected by the Union but the proceeds of the Income Tax are to be shared by the Union and the States. No tax may be levied or collected except by authority of law (Article 265). Tax cannot be imposed by executive order. It can be levied only by an Act of Appropriate Legislature. The law must be a valid law.

Judicial Relations: In India, there is a unified judiciary. In other words, the judicial power has not been divided between the Union and the States. There is a common set of courts for the States as well as the Union. Any violation in the procedures of above, the courts shall interfere and make the system perfect.

Inter-State Council: To bring about meaningful cooperation among the States, Article 263 contemplates establishment of an Inter-State Council. The Sarkaria Commission recommended the setting up of an Inter-State Council for resolving Center-State problems which is a recommendary body. The Council has been established by an order dated 28th May, 1990. It consists of the Prime Minister, the Chief Ministers of all States and Union Territories and six Union Ministers of cabinet rank. A Minister of State with independent charge may be invited if there is in the agenda a matter pertaining to his / her department. The Prime Minister is the Chairman of the Council. It is required to meet thrice a year. After its establishment there exists a forum for inter-governmental consultation, coordination and cooperation. The duties of the Council are:

- Investigating and discussing such subjects in which one or more of the States have common interest
- To make recommendations upon such a subject and for better coordination of policy and action in respect to that subject
- Deliberating on such matters of general interest to the States as may be referred by the Chairman

#### **All India Services**

Article 312 provides for the creation of All India Services. It is different from both the Union and the States Services. It has been pointed out under Article 309; the States are entitled to create their own Civil Services and lay down their own conditions of service just as the Union is entitled to create its own services, make recruitment and lay down conditions of service. Thus, while Article 309 provides for separate jurisdictions for the Union and the States, Article 312 takes away to some extent the autonomy of the States in this field by vesting in the Union, the authority to create All India Services.

All India Services are instruments of national consolidation and unity. They ensure the maintenance of common standards all over the country in fields of administration. They facilitate the existence of a hard core of officials in every State who, because of their membership in a service which falls, within the jurisdiction of the Union, feel more free and independent to act with a national outlook and keeping in view the national interests. The following are the number of Central Services provided by the Union:

- Indian Administrative Service
- Indian Police Service
- Indian Service of Engineers
- Indian Forest Service
- Indian Medical & Health Service
- Indian Foreign Service
- Indian Posts & Telegraph Accounts and Finance Service
- Indian Audit and Accounts Service
- Indian Defence Accounts Service
- Indian Income-tax Service
- Indian Railway Accounts Service
- Indian Customs and Central Excise Service
- Transportation (Traffic) and Commercial Departments of the Superior Revenue Establishment of Indian Railways
- Military Lands and Cantonment Service
- Indian Postal Service
- Central Engineering Service
- Indian Railways Service of Engineering
- Superior Telegraph Engineering and Wireless branches of the Indian Posts & Telegraph Department
- Central Secretariat Service
- Central Information Service
- Indian Ordnance Factories Service

#### **Public Service Commission**

In a large country like India which has linguistic, caste and religious divisions, where Government is the largest employer and people attach power and prestige to government service, it is all the more necessary to ensure fair play in recruitment to maintain unity of the country and efficiency of administration. To provide an instrumentality which will be a body of experts and which will work independently in a just and fair manner withstanding pressure and influence, the Constitution created the various Public Service Commissions. The Constitution envisages a Public Service Commission for the Union and one for each State.

If two or more States agree that there should be a joint Public Service Commission for them and their legislatures pass resolutions, to that effect, then Parliament may by law appoint a Joint State Public Service Commission to serve their needs. The Union Public Service Commission may if requested by the Governor of a State, with the approval of the President agree to serve all or any of the needs of a State (Article 315).

A Commission consists of a Chairman and a number of Members. The number of Members and the conditions of service shall be determined in the case of Union Public Service Commission or a Joint Commission by the President and in the case of a State Public Service Commission by the Governor. This is applicable even for resigning of both Chairman and Member respectively. This is done by making regulations. No qualifications are prescribed for being a Chairman or Member. But it is laid down in Article 316 that as nearly as may be one-half of the members of every Commission shall be persons who have held office under the Government of India or of a State for 10 years. A member of a Commission holds office for a term of 6 years from the date he / she enters upon the Office or until attains the age of 65 years in the case of Union Public Service Commission and 62 years in the case of State Commission or a Joint Commission.

The Constitution seeks to maintain the independence of members. This is sought to be achieved in several ways:

- The Chairman and Members do not hold Office during pleasure. They hold it for a fixed term.
- A Member may be removed only by the President and that too on the grounds and in the manner provided in the Constitution.
- The conditions of service of a Member shall not be varied to his / her disadvantage after their appointment.
- The expenses of the Commission are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or of the State.
- A Member on the expiration of his / her term is ineligible for reappointment.
- A Member is prohibited from taking employment under the Government after ceasing to be a Member.

Functions of the Commission: Article 320 lays down the functions of a Public Service Commission. Article 321 provides that the Parliament or a State Legislature may add to the list of functions. The functions are of two types: (a) Duties and (b) Advisory functions.

- (a) Duties of a Public Service Commission:
  - To conduct examinations for appointment to the Services of the Union (in case of Union Public Service Commission) and the Services of the State (in case of State Public Service Commission).
  - It is the duty of the Union Public Service Commission if requested by two or more States to assist those States in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for any services requiring special qualifications.
  - Any matter that may be referred by the President or the Governor for advice.

- (b) Advisory functions of a Public Service Commission: It may be consulted:
  - On all matters relating to method of recruitment to civil services and civil posts.
  - On the principles to be followed in making appointments to civil services and posts, in making promotions and transfers from one service to another and on the suitability of such candidates.
  - On all disciplinary matters affecting a person under the Government in a civil capacity which includes memorials and petitions relating to such matters.
  - On any claim for the award of a pension in respect of injuries sustained by a person while in the government service in a civil capacity.

#### **Administrative Tribunals**

In Part XIV -A, an innovative provision 'Administrative Tribunals' was made, which consists of two Articles 323A and 323B (Adopted by the Forty Second Amendment of the Constitution). The basic objective of Administrative Tribunal is to take out of the purview of the regular courts of law certain matters of dispute between the citizen and government agencies and make the judicial process quick and less expensive.

Section (1) of Article 323A provides for the adjudication or trial by Administrative Tribunals of disputes and complaints with respect to recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State or of any local or other authority within the territory of India. The power to constitute such Tribunals is vested exclusively in the Parliament.

Section (2) of the same Article provides that a law made by the Parliament under Section (1) may:

- Provide for the establishment of an Administrative Tribunal for the Union and a separate Administrative Tribunal for each State or for two or more States
- Specify the jurisdiction, powers and authority which may be exercised by such Tribunals
- Provide for the procedure to be followed by these Tribunals
- Exclude the jurisdiction of all courts except the special jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 136

Article 323B empowers the Parliament or State Legislature to set up Tribunals for matters other than those covered by Clause (2) of Article 323A. The matters to be covered by such Tribunals are as follows:

- Levy, assessment, collection and enforcement of any tax
- Foreign exchange, import and export across custom frontiers
- Industrial and labour disputes
- Matters connected with land reforms covered by Article 31A
- Ceiling on urban property
- Election to either House of Parliament or Legislatures of the States
- Production, procurement, supply and distribution of foodstuffs or other essential goods
