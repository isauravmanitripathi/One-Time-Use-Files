#### **CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS**

One of the peculiar features of the Indian Constitution is that various parts of it call for various processes of Amendments. The methods of Amendments are three, according to the subject matter of the Article concerned. (1) Articles that may be amended by a simple majority of the Parliament. These are mainly matters of detail like those provided in the Schedules. (2) Articles that may be amended by two-thirds majority of both the Houses of Parliament. These are comparatively important matters. (3) Articles that require not only a two-thirds majority of Parliament but also ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures.

Articles of the third category are specifically mentioned. They are the following: Articles concerning the election of the President (Articles 54 & 55), the powers of the Union Cabinet (Article 73), the powers of State Cabinets (Article 162), the High Courts in Union Territories (Article 241), the establishment of Supreme Court (Chapter IV, Part V), Constitution and powers of High Courts (Chapter V, Part VI). Relations between the Union & State Legislatures (Chapter I, Part IX), the Lists – Union List, State List and Concurrent List – in the 7th Schedule, the representation of States in Parliament and the provisions of Article 368 itself (Part XX).

Article 368 (Part XX) lays down the general procedure for the Amendments. But Articles that require a only a simple majority in the Parliament do not fall in this category. Such Articles are indicated by a special clause attached to each of them which specifically excludes the operation of the Article 368 (Refer Article 21, 6th Schedule). Amendment of all other Articles comes within the scope of Article 368.

#### **IMPORTANT CASES**

#### **Case – 1: Maneka Gandhi vs Union of India (1978)**

The fact situation in this case was as follows:

Section 10 (3)(c) of the Passport Act authorizes the Passport authority to impound a Passport authority to impound a Passport if it deems it necessary to do so in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of India, friendly relations of India with any foreign country, or in the interest of the general public. Maneka's Passport was impounded by the Central Government under the Passport Act in the interest of the general public.

Maneka filed a writ petition challenging the order on the ground of violation of her Fundamental Rights under Article 21. One of the major grounds of challenge was that the order impounding the Passport was null and void as it had been made without affording her an opportunity to being heard in her defence.

The Court laid down a number of propositions seeking to make Article 21 much more meaningful than hitherto.

- The court reiterated the proposition that Articles 14, 19 and 21 are not mutually exclusive. A law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of 'personal liberty' has to meet the requirements of Article 19. Also the procedure established by law in Article 21 must answer the requirement of Article 14 as well.
- The expression 'Personal Liberty' in Article 21 was given an expansive interpretation. The expression 'Personal Liberty' ought not to be read in a narrow and restricted sense so as to exclude those attributes of personal liberty, which are specifically dealt with in Article 19. The right to travel abroad falls under Article 21.
- The most significant and creative aspect of Maneka case is the re-interpretation by the Court of the expression 'procedure established by law' used in Article 21. Article 21 would no longer mean that law could prescribe some semblance of procedure, however arbitrary or fanciful, to deprive a person of his personal liberty. It now means that the procedure must satisfy certain requisites in the sense of being fair and reasonable.

The procedure cannot be arbitrary unfair or unreasonable.

As the right to travel abroad falls under Article 21, natural justice must be applied while exercising the power of impounding a Passport under the Passport Act. Although the Passport Act does not expressly provide for the requirement of hearing before a passport is impounded, yet the same has to be implied therein.

#### **Case – 2: Sunil Batra vs Delhi Administration (1980)**

The Court has given several directives to improve many aspects of prison administration and condition of prisoners. In this case, the Court has pointed out that its powers under Article 32 are free from the rigid restraints of the traditional English writs. Prison torture is not beyond the reach of the Supreme Court under Article 32. For this purpose, the Court treats letters from prisoners as writ petitions. In this case, the judicial process was set in motion by a letter written by a prisoner to a Judge of the Supreme Court complaining of the brutal attack by the prison staff on a fellow prisoner. Forsaking all procedural formalities, 'since freedom was at stake', the letter was treated by the Court as a petition for the writ of Habeas Corpus.

#### **Case – 3: Hussainara Khatoon vs Home Secretary–State of Bihar (1979)**

Hussainara Khatoon case of the Bihar under trials started with an Article written in Indian Express. An advocate then filed a petition under Article 32 in the Supreme Court to protect the personal liberty of the under trials. The Supreme Court has laid great emphasis on speedy trial of criminal offences and has emphasized: "It is implicit in the broad sweep and content of Article 21". A fair trial implies a speedy trial. No procedure can be 'reasonable fair or just' unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person. The Supreme Court has directed release of all under trials who have been in jail for periods longer than the maximum term of imprisonment for which they could be sentenced if convicted of the offence charged.

The Court also directed that the under trial prisoners, who are accused of multiple offences and who have already been in jail for the maximum term for which they could be sentenced on conviction, even if the sentences awarded to them were consecutive and not concurrent, should be released forthwith, since their continued detention clearly violates not only human dignity but also their Fundamental Right under Article 21 of the Constitution.

The Supreme Court has taken a big innovative step forward in humanizing the administration of criminal justice by suggesting that free legal aid be provided by the State to poor prisoners facing a prison sentence.

#### **Case – 4: Keshavananda Bharti vs State of Kerala (1973)**

The State of Kerala passed the Kerala Land Reforms Act, 1963. This Act affected the interest of the petitioner, Keshavananda Bharti, Swamiji of a Mutt. So he filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution, contending that his Fundamental Rights under Articles 14, 19(1)(f), 25, 26 and 31 were violated by the Kerala Land Reforms Act.

While the case was pending, the Parliament passed three Constitutional Amendments, viz., 24th, 25th and 29th Amendments. The Constitutional 24th Amendment repealed Article 19(1)(f) which read "to acquire, hold and dispose of property". It also repealed Article 31, i.e., compulsory acquisition of property. It made several other changes. It also included the Kerala Land Reforms Act in the 9th Schedule, thereby making them immune from attack on the ground of Fundamental Rights. As a result, the Fundamental Right to property was deleted from the Constitution.

The petitioner felt that, by these Amendments, he would lose the case in the Court. So, he amended his writ petition before the Supreme Court and challenged the validity of 24th, 25th and 29th Amendments. He contended that though the power of the Parliament to amend was wide, it was not unlimited. The power to amend under Article 368 should not empower the Parliament to destroy the basic features of the Constitution. The Supreme Court's judgement in this case is as follows:

- The Constitutional 24th Amendment Act, 1971, Section 2(a)(b) of the Constitution Constitutional 25th Amendment Act, and the Constitution Constitutional 29th Amendment Act are valid.
- The decision of the majority in Golaknath's case that the word 'law' in Article 13(2) included Amendments to the Constitution and the Article operated as a limitation upon the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368 is erroneous, and so, is overruled.
- The power of Amendment includes within itself the power to add, alter or repeal the various Articles of the Constitution, including those relating to Fundamental Rights.
- There is no power to amend or alter the basic structure of the Constitution.
- The First Part of the Article 31C is valid, and the Second Part of the Article 31C laying down "no law containing a declaration that if it is for giving effect to such

policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy" is invalid.

There is no inherent or implied limitation on the power of Amendment under Article 368.

#### **Case – 5: Air India vs Nergesh Merza (1981)**

A regulation made by Air India, a Statutory Corporation, fixed the normal age of retirement of air hostesses at 35 years but authorized the Managing Director to extend the same to 45 years at his option subject to other conditions being satisfied. The regulation was held bad as it armed the Managing Director with uncanalized and unguided discretion to extend the age of retirement of any air hostess. No guidelines, principles or norms were laid down subject to which the power was to be exercised. Nor was there any procedural safeguard available to an air hostess who was denied extension.

A regulation providing for termination of service of an air hostess in Air India on her first pregnancy has been held to be arbitrary and abhorrent to the notions of a civilized society.

#### **Case – 6: Vishaka vs State of Rajasthan (1997)**

The Supreme Court has declared sexual harassment of a working woman at her place of work as amounting to violation of rights of gender equality and right to life and liberty which is clear violation of Articles 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution. Article 21 guarantees right to life with dignity. Accordingly, the Court has observed in this connection: "The meaning and content of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution of India are of sufficient amplitude to encompass all the facets of gender equality including prevention of sexual harassment or abuse".

Sexual harassment also violates the victim's Fundamental Right under Article 19(1)(g) "to practice any profession or to carry out any occupation, trade or business". Thus Article 32 is attracted.

In the absence of any domestic law relating to sexual harassment in India, the Supreme Court has itself laid down Article 32 some directions for prevention of such harassment. These directions are binding and enforceable and are required to be strictly observed in all work places until suitable legislation is enacted to occupy the field.

#### **Case – 7: M. R. Balaji vs State of Mysore (1963)**

An order of the Mysore Government issued under Article 15(4) reserved seats for admission to the State Medical and Engineering Colleges for Backward Classes (28%) and for Scheduled Tribes (3%). Backward and more backward classes were designated on the basis of 'castes' and 'communities'.

The Supreme Court characterized Article 15(4) as an exception to Article 15(1) [as well as to Article 29(2)]. The Court declared the order bad on several grounds in this case.

The first defect in the Mysore Order was that it was based solely on caste without regard to other relevant factors and this was not permissible under Article 15(4).

- Secondly, the test adopted by the State to measure educational backwardness was the basis of the average of student population in the last three high school classes of all high schools in the State in relation to a thousand citizens of that community. This average for the whole State was 6.9 per thousand. The voice of the Mysore Order was that it included in the list of Backward Classes, castes or communities whose average was slightly above, or very near or just below the State average [for example, Lingayats (7.1) were mentioned in Backward Class list].
- Thirdly, the Court declared that Article 15(4) does not envisage classification between backward and more backward classes as was made by the Mysore Order.

In Balaji case, the Supreme Court could sense the danger in treating 'caste' as the sole criterion for determining social and educational backwardness. The importance of the judgement lies in realistically appraising the situation when the Court said that economic backwardness would provide a more reliable yardstick for determining social backwardness because more often educational backwardness is the outcome of social backwardness. The Court drew distinction between 'caste' and 'class'. An attempt at finding a new basis for ascertaining social and educational backwardness in place of caste is reflected in the Balaji decision.

The Court also ruled that reservation under Article 15(4) should be reasonable. It should not be such as to defeat or nullify the main rule of equality enshrined in Article 15(1). While it would not be possible to predicate the exact permissible percentage of reservation, it can be stated in a general and broad way that it ought to be less than 50%.

#### **Case – 8: Indra Sawhney vs Union of India (1992) – Mandal Commission Case**

The Supreme Court has taken cognizance of many complex but very momentous questions having a bearing on the future welfare and stability of the Indian society.

- The overall reservation in a year is limited to a maximum of 50%.
- Amongst the classes granted reservation, those who have been benefited from reservation and have thus improved their social status (called the 'creamy layer' by the Court), should not be allowed to benefit from reservation over and over again. This means that the benefit of reservation should not be misappropriated by the upper caste but that the benefit of reservation should be allowed to filter down to the lowliest so that they may benefit from reservation to improve their position. The Court has said that if a member of IAS, IPS or any other All India Service, his / her social status rises; he / she is no longer socially disadvantaged. This means that, in effect, a family can avail of the reservation only once.
- An element of merit has been introduced into the scheme of reservation:
  - Promotions are to be merit based and are to be excluded from the reservation rule.
  - Certain posts are excluded from the reservation rule and recruitment to such posts is to be merit based.
  - Minimum standards have to be laid for recruitment to the reserved posts.

#### **Case – 9: Murali S. Deora vs Union of India (2002)**

Consequence to this case, the Supreme Court prohibited smoking in public places and issued direction to the Union of India, State Governments and Union Territories to take effective steps to ensure prohibition in public places. The Court held that there is no reason to compel non-smokers to be helpless victims of air pollution which is injurious.

#### **Case – 10: Unnikrishnan vs State of Andhra Pradesh (1993)**

The Supreme Court has ruled that establishing educational institutions cannot be regarded as trade or commerce falling under Article 19(1)(g). Imparting education cannot be allowed to become commerce. Trade or business normally connotes an activity carried on for a profit motive. Imparting of education has never been regarded as commerce in India. Private educational institutions are a necessity of the day as the Government alone cannot meet the demand for education particularly in the sector of Medical and Technical Education which calls for huge outlays. In this case, the Court was faced with the question – how to encourage private educational institutions without allowing them to commercialize education.

The Court has reiterated the proposition that having regard to the fundamental significance of education to the life of an individual and the nation, the right to education is implicit in, and flows from the right to life guaranteed by Article 21. The parameters of this right, which is not absolute, have to be determined in the light of the Directive Principles contained in Articles 43, 45 and 46. The Court has now limited the State obligation to provide educational facilities as follows:

- Every citizen has a right to free education until he / she completes the age of 14 years.
- Beyond that age, the State obligation to provide education is subject to the limits of the economic capacity and development of the State. While denouncing the levy of capitation fee by certain professional colleges, the Court has however accepted that unaided private educational institutions can charge higher tuition fee.

The Supreme Court held that Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are supplementary and complementary to each other and that the provisions in Part III (Fundamental Rights) should be interpreted having regard to the Preamble and the Directive Principles of State Policy.

#### **Case – 11: TMA Pai Foundation vs State of Karnataka (2002)**

In this case, some of the major questions pending decision before the Supreme Court are:

- What are the indicia for treating an institution as a minority educational institution?
- Whether the State or the affiliating University can regulate admission of students to minority educational institutions?
- Whether the ratio in St. Stephen's College case (50%) is correct?

- Whether the ruling in Unnikrishnan case requires reconsideration / modification? What is the meaning of the expressions 'Education' and 'Educational Institutions' in various provisions of the Constitution?
- Is the right to establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under the Constitution?

After a long wait, an 11-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court heard and decided the matter in 2002. It was held.

- The right to establish and administer educational institutions is guaranteed to all citizens [Articles 19(1)(g) and 26] and to minorities specifically under Article 30. These rights are not limited to minorities and are available to all persons.
- The State is to be regarded as the unit for determining both 'linguistic minority' as well as 'religious minority'.
- The question whether a sect or denomination of a religion can claim minority status even though followers of that religion are in minority was left unanswered.
- The question as to what are the criteria for treating an educational institution as minority institution was left open.
- The right of minorities under Article 30 covers professional institutions.
- Admission to students to unaided minority institutions cannot be regulated by the State or a University but it can provide the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic interests.
- An aided minority educational institution has the right to admit students belonging to the minority but it may be required by the State Government to admit a reasonable number of non-minority students. Reasonable number would depend on the type of institution, courses being run and educational needs of the minorities.
- Among the minority group admissions must be on merit.
- In case of aided professional institutions, the State may prescribe that only those persons may be admitted who have passed a common entrance test.
- A minority institution may have its own procedure and method of admission but the procedure must be fair and transparent. Selection in professional and higher education colleges should be based on merit.
- The State can provide that in aided institutions consideration is shown to weaker sections.
- In case of unaided institutions, the controls should be minimal. Conditions of recognition and affiliation by or to a Board or University have to be complied. But the appointment of teaching and non-teaching staff and control over them will vest in the management. The State may frame regulations prescribing the minimum qualification of a teacher or the Principal and also in regard to service conditions.
- Unaided institutions can charge any fees but no institution can charge capitation fee.

- The basic ratio of St. Stephen's College is correct but rigid percentage cannot be stipulated.
- The (partly over ruled) scheme framed in Unnikrishnan case is unconstitutional. But the principle that there should be no capitation fee or profiteering is correct (partly over ruled).

## **Case – 12: People's Union for Democratic Rights vs Union of India (1982) – Asiad Case**

The Supreme Court has given an expansive significance to the term 'Forced Labour' used in Article 23(1) in a series of cases beginning with the Asiad Case in 1982. The Court has insisted that Article 23 is intended to abolish every form of forced labour even if it has origin in a contract. The Court insisted that every form of forced labour is within the inhibition of Article 23 and it makes no difference whether the person who is forced to give his labour or service to another is remunerated or not. Even if a person has contracted with another to perform service and there is consideration for such service, "he cannot be forced, by compulsion of law or otherwise to perform such service, as that would be forced labour".

Even payment of wages less than the minimum wages would be regarded as forced labour. This case was brought before the Supreme Court under Article 32 by an organization devoted to the protection of democratic rights of the people complaining of the breaches of the workers engaged in the construction of the Asiad projects.

## **Case – 13: Church of God (Full Gospel) in India vs KKRMC Welfare Association (2000)**

The question of controlling noise pollution has become embroiled with the question of religious freedom guaranteed by the Articles 25 and 26. Can a church claim the freedom to relay prayers on the loudspeakers causing noise pollution and nuisance to the residents? The Supreme Court has ruled in this case, that the question of religious freedom does not arise as no religion requires that prayers be performed through voice amplifiers. The Court directed that the guidelines framed by the Government under the relevant rules framed under Environmental Protection Act, 1986 must be followed by the concerned authorities. Any such practice use of loudspeakers by a particular community should not affect the rights of others.

#### **Case – 14: M. C. Mehta vs Union of India (1987)**

A petition was filed under Article 32 of the Constitution by an advocate bringing the pollution of the river Ganges to the notice of the Court. This was caused by the discharge of effluents into the Ganges by the tanneries at Jajmau in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The petition invoked Articles 21, 48A and 51 of the Constitution together with the Water (Protection) Act, 1974. Referring to the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 as well as the Water Act, the Court noted that nothing had been done to stop this public nuisance. The tanneries which had not taken minimum steps for the primary treatment of industrial effluents were ordered to be closed. This was done despite the unemployment and loss of revenue it would cause as the Court stated that life, health and ecology have greater importance.

#### **Case – 15: Bijoe Emmanuel vs State of Kerala (1987)**

The Director of Public Instruction, Kerala issued a circular instructing the students of all schools to sing National Anthem in their schools. Three students belonging to Jehovah's witnesses were expelled as they did not sing the National Anthem. A writ was filed by Bijoe Emmanuel on behalf of the three students in Kerala High Court, questioning the validity of the school management's expulsion order and also the circular of the Director of Public Instruction. The Kerala High Court dismissed the writ petition and upheld the expulsion. It held that it was every citizen's fundamental duty to respect the national integrity and to sing the National Anthem.

The Supreme Court reversed the judgement of the Kerala High Court and gave its judgement in favour of the appellant. The Court ruled that Jehovah's witnesses constitute a religious denomination. Compelling a student belonging to the Jehovah's witnesses to join in the National Anthem despite his "genuine conscientious religious objection", would contravene the right guaranteed by Articles 19(1)(a) and 25(1). The Court has noted that Jehovah's witnesses wherever they are do not sing the National Anthem, though they show respect to it by standing up whenever it is sung. They truly and conscientiously believe that their religion does not permit the singing of the National Anthem.

The Court has also held it a violation of Article 19(1)(a) to punish a student for not singing the National Anthem. Thus, the negative right, the right to remain silent has been implied in the Freedom of Speech guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a). As regards Article 51A(a) imposing fundamental duties on citizens of India, the Court said, "It is true Article 51A(a) enjoins a duty on every citizen of India to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and National Anthem".

Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when it is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in singing.

Parliament finds it convenient to constitute Committees to conduct in depth studies and make recommendations.

The following are the important list of Committees:

- Business Advisory Committee

- Committee on Petitions

- Estimates Committee The Government of the day formulates the economic policies and presents demands to the Parliament for carrying out the policies. In order to

scrutinize the expenditure proposed by the Government in an informal atmosphere disregarding party lines, this is constituted after the budget is presented before the Lok Sabha.

## **Motion**

It is a procedural Parliamentary device by which the functions of the House are sought to be achieved. In simple words, it sets the House in motion. It generally suggests a course of action before the House. Some important motions are –

- Discussion on Matters of Public Importance: This is covered under Rule 184 of the Lok Sabha.
- No Confidence Motion: Rule 198 of Lok Sabha governs the no confidence motion in the Council of Ministers. Article 75 mentions that the Council of Ministers is to be collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha. Hence, it can be introduced only in the Lok Sabha. The time allotted for this motion is much longer as compared to other motions. It may range from a day to a week depending on the consensus in the House. This takes precedence over all other business that may be pending before the House. If the House passes the motion, the Prime Minister is obliged to submit the resignation of his / her Council of Ministers.
- Confidence Motion: It is moved by the ruling party to seek or demonstrate the support of the majority of the House. The necessity for this new kind of motion arose because under the Parliamentary form of Government, the President must invite the leader of the party or group commanding a majority in the Lok Sabha to form a Ministry. The majority in this context means a majority of seats in the Lok Sabha and not the simple majority of the members present and voting on a particular motion.
- Adjournment Motion: When there is an urgent matter of public importance then a member may propose that the business of the House be adjourned for discussing that matter. This motion can be moved only with the consent of the Speaker. Generally such motions are discussed in the afternoon at 4.00 p.m. as per Rule 56.

## **Indian Penal Code**

It provides a penal code for all India including Jammu & Kashmir, where it was renamed the Ranbir Penal Code. The code applies to any offence committed by an Indian citizen anywhere and on any Indian registered ship or aircraft. The draft of the Indian Penal Code was prepared by the First Law Commission. It was chaired by Lord Macaulay. Its basis is the law of England freed from superfluities, technicalities and local peculiarities. Suggestions

were also derived from the French Penal Code and from Livingstone's Code of Louisiana. The draft underwent a very careful revision at the hands of Sir Barnes Peacock, Chief Justice, and puisne Judges of the Calcutta Supreme Court who were the members of the Legislative Council, and was passed into law in 1860, unfortunately Macaulay did not survive to see his masterpiece enacted into law.

Indian Penal Code came into force in 1862 (during the British Raj) and is regularly amended. The code contains several sections related to dowry law in India and has a total of 511 Sections covering various aspects of the Criminal Law. The nature of these has led to allegations of abuse of those laws. It was inherited by Pakistan and Bangladesh, formerly part of British India. It was also adopted wholesale by the British colonial authorities in Burma, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, and remains the basis of the criminal codes in those countries.

#### **Republic Day of India**

It is India's great national festival. It is celebrated every year on 26th January, in New Delhi with great pomp and pageant and in Capitals of the States, as well as at other Headquarters and important places with patriotic fervor. It was the Lahore Session of the Indian National Congress at midnight of 31st December, 1929 to 1st January, 1930, that the Tri-colour Flag was unfurled by the nationalists and a pledge taken that year on 26th January, the 'Independence Day' would be celebrated and that the people would unceasingly strive for the establishment of a Sovereign Democratic Republic of India. The professed pledge was successfully redeemed on 26th January, 1950, when the Constitution of India from by the Constituent Assembly of India came into force, although the independence from the British rule was achieved on 15th August, 1947.

It is because of this that 15th August is celebrated as Independence Day, while 26th as Republic Day. The most spectacular celebrations include the march past of the three Armed Forces, massive parades, folk dances by tribal folk from the different States in picturesque costumes making the cultural unity of India. Further, the streak of jet planes of Indian Air Force, leaving a trial of coloured smoke, marks the end of the festival. The trees on both sides of the routes and the lawns become alive with spectators.

The President of India at New Delhi, on this most colourful day, takes salute of the contingents of Armed Forces. In the States, the Governors take the salute, and Districts & Taluks, same procedure is followed by the District Collectors & the Assistant Collectors respectively. At Vijay Chowk in New Delhi, three days later (i.e. 29th January) the massed bands of the Armed Forces 'Beat the Retreat' in a majestic manner.

The Republic Day celebrations have rightly become world famous as one of the greatest shows on earth drawing thousands of eager sight-seers from all over the country and many parts of the world. No other country can draw on such a wealth of tribal traditions and cultures, so many regional forms of dances and dress. And, no other country in the world can parade so many ethnically different people in splendid uniforms as India's Armed Forces. But they are united in the proven loyalty to the Government elected by the people and in their proud traditions and legendary gallantry.

Officially, Republic Day is celebrated all over the country – National Capital, State Capitals, Municipal Corporations, Panchayats, and other official agencies. At the level of the people, it is observed in homes, housing colonies, schools, colleges and institutions of evert kind.

#### **Official Language of the Union**

India is rich in languages. There are quite a number of languages spoken in India. Some of these languages are accepted nationally while others are accepted as dialects of that particular region. The Indian languages belong to four language families namely, Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic (Austric) and Sino-Tibetan. Majority of the India's population are using Indo-European and Dravidian languages. The former was spoken mainly in northern and central regions and the latter in southern India. Some ethnic groups in Assam and other parts of eastern India speak Austric languages. People in the northern Himalayan region and near the Burmese border speak Sino-Tibetan languages. The written forms of language or script come from an ancient Indian script called Brahmi.

India has 22 officially recognized languages. The Part that describes the official language of the Indian democracy has to be written to promote a feeling of unity among Indian citizens. As we know that even today anywhere between 300 to 1000 languages are spoken in India, this makes the integral part of the Constitution. The official language of India shall be Hindi in Devanagari script. The form of numerals to be used for the official purposes of the Union shall be the international form of Indian numerals.

Notwithstanding anything in Clause (1) for a period of fifteen years from the commencement of this Constitution, the English language shall continued to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement.

Sanskrit, the classical language of India, represents the highest achievement of the Indo-Aryan languages. The beginning of Sanskrit literature may be traced back to Rig Vedic period. It is the oldest literary language of India, which is more than 5000 years old and the basis of many modern Indian languages including Hindi and Urdu. Provided that the President may, during the said period, by order authorize the use of the Hindi language in addition to the English language and of the Devanagari form of numerals in addition to the international form of Indian numerals for any of the official purposes of the Union.

## **Bharat Ratna**

It is the India's highest civilian award given for exceptional service towards the advancement of Art, Literature and Science, and in recognition of public service of the highest order. It was established by the President of India, on 2nd January, 1954. The regulations were revised on 8th January, 1955 (to alter the design) and amended on 26th January, 1957 (to alter the depiction of the devices on the obverse and reverse). From 13th July, 1977 to 26th January, 1980, awards of the Bharat Ratna were suspended.

The original specifications for the award called for a circular gold medal, 35 mm in diameter, with the sun and the Hindi legend 'Bharat Ratna' above and a floral wreath below. The reverse was to carry the State Emblem and Motto. It was to be worn around the neck from a 2 inches white ribbon. There is no indication that any specimens of this design were ever produced and one year later the design was altered.

#### **Parliament House, New Delhi**

It is a massive circular edifice measuring about 170.69 meters (560 feet) in diameter and 536.33 meters (one-third a mile) in circumference. The magnificent building stands unique among the new buildings built later. The continuous open verandah on the first floor, fringed with a colonnade of 144 creamy sandstone columns, each standing 8.23 meters (27 feet), lends an unparalleled grandeur to the building. While India's new capital was designed by Sir Edward Lutyens, the Parliament House was designed by Sir Herbert Baker.

The original plan for New Delhi, prepared in 1911, had not provided for a Legislature building. A decision to build a Legislature building was taken after the First World War and after the introduction of Montague-Chelmsford reforms. The design for the structure was approved 1919 and the foundation stone was laid on 12th February, 1921 by the Duke of Connaught. The work was completed in six years by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) under the supervision of Chief Engineers Sir Hugh Keeling and Sir Alexander Rouse. The construction cost of the project was Rs.83 lakhs. The black marble used in the columns of the Chambers of the two Houses of Parliament came from Gaya in Bihar; the white and hued marble which lines the walls of the present Library Hall came from Makrana in Rajasthan; the teak and other wooden material used for doors from Assam and Burma; and rosewood from South India. The Parliament House covers an area of six acres and has 12 gates.

The opening House ceremony of the Parliament House building was performed on 18th January, 1927 by the then Viceroy and Governor-General of India, Lord Irwin (1926–1931).

#### **Question Hour**

In the both houses of the legislatures every day the first hour is reserved for asking questions on various burning issues. It is called the 'Question Hour' session. The members of the House ask questions about the problems facing people such as social injustice, corruption and other malpractices in the administration. The questions are divided into three parts: (a) The Starred Questions, (b) The Unstarred Questions, and (c) The Shortnotice Questions. The Starred Questions are orally answered in the House. Members can ask sub-questions. The Unstarred Questions are answered by the Ministers in writing. However, this period is restricted to one hour only.

### **Zero Hour**

 It refers to the left over time after the Question hour in Parliament. This is about 12 Noon which is why it is called Zero Hour. During this hour, the members can raise matters of great importance without prior notice. The duration is anything between five and fifteen minutes.
