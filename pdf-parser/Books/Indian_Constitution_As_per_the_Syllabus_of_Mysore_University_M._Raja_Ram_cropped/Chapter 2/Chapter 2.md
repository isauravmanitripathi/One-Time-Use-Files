# **POWER AND FUNCTION OF DIFFERENT ORGANS OF STATE AND UNION GOVERNMENT**

**The Democratic Institutions created by the Constitution – Bicameral system of Legislature and Cabinet form of Government at the Center and States – Role and Position of the President and the Prime Minister – Adult Franchise System – Election Commission – Panchayat Raj System**

In India, there are 28 States and six Centrally-administered Territories and Delhi is under Capital Administration\*. All these States form the Union of India. The States have no power to secede from the Union. As indicated by the Constitution, there is a government at the Center and at the State level and they carry on administration according to the division of powers. Any act of government which goes against the Constitution is declared ultra vires (beyond powers) by the Supreme Court of India.

(\* 28 States: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jammu & Kashmir, Nagaland, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Manipur, Tripura, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Uttaranchal, Chattisgarh and Jharkhand AND

\* 7 Union Territories: Chandigarh, Delhi, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Diu & Daman and Pondicherry)

# **Relationship between the Center and the States**

Today, in a written Constitution, there are TWO kinds: one is unitary type, where there is only one government to the entire nation (Examples are England, France, etc.). The other one is federal type, where the powers of the nation are divided between the Center and States (Examples are India, USA, Switzerland, etc.). The Constitution has distributed the powers into THREE Lists:

- Central / Union List: There are 97 subjects like Defence, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Railways, Broadcasting, Civil Aviation, Meteorology, Monuments, Post & Telegraph, Telephone, Wireless, Prisons, Roads, War and Peace, Currency and Coinage, Reserve Bank of India, Trade Alliances, Insurance, Armed forces, Arms & Ammunition, Atomic Energy, Diplomatic Representation, United Nations, Treaties, Citizenship, Extradition, Shipping & Navigation, Legal Tender, Foreign Loans, Inter-State Trade & Commerce, Incorporation & its Regulation, Banking, Bills of Exchange, Stock Exchange, Patents, Establishment of Standards in Weights & Measures, Control of Industries, Regulation and Development of Mines, Minerals & Oil Resources, Maintenance of National Museums, Libraries & such other Institutions, Historical Monuments, Survey of India, Union Public Services, Elections, Parliamentary privileges, Audit of Government Accounts, Constitution & Organization of the Supreme Court, High Courts and Union Public Service Commission, Income Tax, Custom & Export Duties, Duties of Excise, Corporation Tax, Estate Duty, Sales Tax, Purchase of Newspapers, etc. In these matters, the Center can make laws.
- State List: There are 66 subjects like Police, Jail, Forests, Land Revenue, Agriculture, Law Courts, Cattle & Health, Hospitals, Fisheries, Irrigation, Trade Unions, Labor Welfare, Public Order, Local Government, Cooperative Society, Betting and Gambling, Theatres, Estate Duty, Duties of Excise, Administration of Justice, Public Health & Sanitation, Intoxicating Liquors, Burial & Burial Grounds, Libraries & Museums controlled by the State, Inter-State Communications, Water Supplies, Land Rights, Fisheries, Trade & Commerce within the State, Gas & Gas Works, Markets & Fairs, Money Lending, Local Elections, Legislative Privileges, Salaries & Allowances of all State Officers, State Public Services and the State Public Service Commission, Land Revenue, Taxes on Agricultural Income, Taxes on Lands & Buildings, Estate Duty & Succession Duty on Agricultural Land, Excise Duties on Alcoholic Liquors, Opium, etc. produced within the State, Taxes on Electricity, Taxes on Sale and Purchase of Goods other than Newspapers, Taxes on Goods and Passengers carried by Road or Inland Waterways, Taxes on Vehicles, Professional Tax, Capitation Taxes, Taxes on Luxury, etc. Here, the State can make the laws.
- Concurrent List: There are 47 subjects like Criminal Laws, Civil Procedure, Education, Electricity, Industries / Factories, Power, Joint Family, Marriage and Divorce, Medical Service, Press, Religion Monuments, Administration of Justice, Weights and Measures, Economic and Social Planning, Registration of Births and Deaths, News Papers, Books, Printing, Price Control and Adulteration of Materials, State Security, Transfer of Property other than Agricultural land, Contracts, Bankruptcy and Insolvency, Trust & Trustees, Civil Procedure, Contempt of Court, Vagrancy, Drugs & Poisons, Labour Welfare, Commercial & Industrial Monopolies, Trade Unions, Social Security, Vital Statistics, Trade & Commerce, Stamp Duties, etc. Here, the Center and State have the powers of making laws.

However, the administration of the centrally administered Territories is carried by the President. In 1993, Delhi was given the status as a state and the administration was assigned to the Legislature. It has a special status under Central supervision. In case of Emergency, the Center suspends many rights and assumes many special powers. Taking into consideration of unity and security of the nation, the founding fathers of our Constitution have given more powers to the Center. Hence our Constitution is more unitary, that federal in its nature. It is rightly termed as quasi-federal by some writers. The Indian Parliament has power to create new states and in the recent past three states of Chhattisgarh, Uttaranchal and Jharkhand are created.

Ultra vir Ultra virUltra vires:It is the lack of power. It refers to incompetency. If a State legislated on a subject in the Union list, the resultant Act would be ultra vires and consequently void. Repugnancy refers to inconsistency. If the law made by a State belonging to the Concurrent List is inconsistent with a Union law then the question of repugnancy comes. The whole of the law is not void. It is void only to the extent of repugnancy.

# **THE UNION / CENTRAL GOVERNMENT**

It has THREE organs. They are:

- Legislature: This organ makes the laws
- Executive: The laws made by the Legislature are implemented by this organ
- Judiciary: This organ decides cases according to the laws

#### **A. Union Legislature**

It is also called as Parliament. The Parliament of India consists of the President of India and the two Houses, namely, Rajya Sabha (Upper House / House of States / RS) and Lok Sabha (Lower House / House of People / LS). The sessions of the Parliament are held in the Parliament House at New Delhi. Here, the Members of the Parliament make laws which are applicable to the whole of India. Though the President of the Republic is not a Member of the Parliament, he is an indivisible part of the Parliament. Both the Houses of Parliament must meet at least twice a year. The Members of the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha are called Members of the Parliament. They enjoy freedom of speech and expression in the Parliament and the opinions expressed by them cannot be questioned in a Court of Law.

# **Powers and Functions of the Parliament**

- Legislative: The main function of the Parliament is to make laws. It can also amend or revoke (withdraw) existing laws.
- Financial: The Finance Bill must be presented and discussed first in the Lok Sabha. After being passed by the Lok Sabha, the Bill goes to the Rajya Sabha for approval. Thereafter, it is sent to the President of India for assent. Also, the Union Government cannot collect taxes and money without the approval of the Parliament. Hence, the Parliament has full control over the financial matters of the country.
- Administrative: The questions put by the Members must be answered by the concerned Ministers. The Members are expected to keep a watch over the functioning of various Departments. They can point out the lapses and misuse of powers on the part of the Ministers.

- Constitutional: The Parliament has power to amend or change some Articles of the Constitution.
- Other Powers: The Members of the Parliament and the Members of the Legislative Assemblies of all States elect the President of India. However, the Vice President of India is elected by the Members of the Parliament.

# **Sessions of Parliament**

Under the Article 85, the President has the power to summon and prorogue either House of Parliament from time to time and to dissolve the Lok Sabha. The interval between the two sessions must not exceed six months. There are generally three sessions in a year.

- The Budget Session: It commences in the 3rd week of February. This being the first session of the year it commences with the address by the president on the first day to both the Houses assembled together. A few days later, the Railway Budget is presented. On the last day of the month, the General Budget is presented. The time for the presentation used to be 5 p.m. but from the year 2001, it has been changed to 11 a.m. after the presentation of the Budget, the Houses pass a motion of thank to the President for his / her address. After that the Railway Budget and then the demand for grants are taken. The Finance Bill which gives effect to the Budget proposals and the relevant Appropriation Bills are passed. As most of the time, an attention is devoted to the Budget; this session is called the Budget Session.
- The Monsoon Session: It begins usually in the 3rd week of July. It is the rainy season for us connected with the arrival of the monsoon, which gives the session its name. The session is mostly devoted to legislative business.
- The Winter Session: It starts in early November and ends in the 3rd week of December. Apart from the usual questions, calling attention and other motions, the major portion of time is set aside for legislative work.

Adjournment: It is Adjournment: the suspension of work in a sitting announced by the Presiding Officer. It may range from a few minutes to days together. When there is grave disorder, the Presiding Officer sometimes adjourns the House or suspends a sitting for a time to be named by him / her.

Prorogation: A ogation: House is prorogued by the President. He / she does so on the advice of the council of Ministers. It is generally done after the House is adjourned sine die but there is no bar to the President proroguing the House which is in session. Prorogation brings the session to an end.

Dissolution: Dissolution: It is in Dissolution: the power of the President who, save in exceptional circumstances, does so on the advice of the Council of Ministers. Rajya Sabha being a permanent chamber cannot be dissolved. Only the Lok Sabha is subject to dissolution. It ends the life of Lok Sabha. New Lok Sabha takes its place after the general elections are held.

Session: Session:Session: It is a period of time commencing on the day the first meeting of the House is held and ending on the day it is prorogued or dissolved.

Recess: It is Recess: the period spanning between the prorogation of a House and its assembly in a new session.

This is done on the advice of the Business Advisory Committee. In the morning when Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha assembles at 11.00 a.m., the first one hour is devoted to answering questions. This is called Question Hour. The next one hour is observed as Zero Hour where discussions, resolutions, government business, etc can be discussed without priority (i.e. 12.00 to 1.00 pm).

#### **RAJYA SABHA**

The maximum number of seats / members in Rajya Sabha is 250. The Members are not directly elected by the citizens of the country. The Members of the State Assemblies elect 238 Members and the remaining 12 Members are nominated by the President of India (12 Members are chosen from among the stalwarts in the field of Science, Arts, Commerce, etc. on the basis of merit of their service). It is a permanent body. Once in two years, one-third of its Members retire and elections are conducted for these vacancies. The term of a membership is six years. To become a Member, one should be a citizen of India and must not be less than 30 years of age.

The Vice President of India is the Chairman and he / she conducts all the proceedings of the Rajya Sabha. Also, the Members of the Rajya Sabha elect one among them as the Deputy Chairman.

#### **LOK SABHA**

The maximum number of seats / members in Lok Sabha is 552. The Members are directly elected by the citizens who are the above the age of eighteen. The duration of each Lok Sabha is five years. However, under circumstances, it may be dissolved before the expiry of the full term by the President on the Recommendation of the Prime Minister. Hence, Lok Sabha is not a permanent body. Certain seats are reserved for the members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The President of India can nominate two Anglo-Indian members to the Lok Sabha. To become a Member, one should be a citizen of India, and must not be less than 25 years of age. The Member must not hold any office of profit under the government; should not have been imprisoned; should not have been declared a person of unsound mind by a Court of Law; and should not be an insolvent.

Emergency Powers: To meet certain types of abnormal circumstances in the country, he / she has the power to declare National Emergency. This power is exercised by him / her on the advice of the Council of Ministers. There are three kinds of Emergencies during which the President can declare Emergency with the approval of the Parliament and they are: a) When the constitutional machinery has failed in a State, he / she can declare emergency and can dissolve the legislature or suspend it; b) When the country is threatened by external aggression; and c) When the financial condition is in crisis, he / she can declare Financial Emergency.

(So far, Emergency was declared three times in our country. Firstly, in October 1962 when China attacked India; Secondly during Pakistani attack in August & September 1965 and December 1971; and Thirdly during 1975 under the excuse of internal disturbances)

From past experience, it is felt that there is a need to make following changes in the Presidential election:

- He / she should not be a member of any political party in previous five years
- He / she should not have crossed the age of 65 years at the time of election
- Only one term to be fixed
- He / she not have faced any criminal cases anytime in his / her life
- He / she should have a minimum University degree

The mode of election of our President defers from that of the United States of America or France. He / she is elected by a body of electors constituting an Electoral College. It consists of:

- The elected Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha (Nominated Members of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha are not electors)
- The elected members of the Legislative Assembly of the States (Nominated Members are excluded)
- The Members of the Legislative Assembly of the National Capital Territory of Delhi and of the Union Territory of Pondicherry (70th Amendment Act, 1st June, 1995)

(NOTE:Our first President Dr. Rajendra Prasad is the only one to have been President for two consecutive terms)

Emoluments: Emoluments:By passing the President's Emoluments and Pension (Amendment) Act, 1998, Parliament has raised to Rs.50000/- per month. The same Act provides for the payment of an annual pension of Rs.300000/- to a person who held Office as President, on the expiration of his term or on resignation, provided he is not re-elected to the Office. (Rs.10000/- originally, raised to Rs.20000/- in 1990 and to Rs.50000/- in 1998 with effect from 1st January, 1996)

Veto: It is the eto: power of the executive to withhold or refuse assent to legislation. The purpose is to prevent ill-conceived legislation as well legislations, which may be ultra vires or unconstitutional.

#### **Vetoes are classified into**

- Absolute Veto: It is the power to say no to a Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament. Such a bill never becomes an Act. The power cannot be overridden by the legislature. The President has his / her power in relation to all Bills except Money Bills.
- Qualified Veto: It is that power to veto which can be overridden by the legislature by a special majority (in case of United States of America). In India, there is no requirement of special majority. If a Bill is adopted again by the Houses, the President cannot withhold assent. Hence, there is no qualified veto.
- Suspensive Veto: It is a veto that may be overridden by an ordinary or simple majority. Our President exercises this veto when he / she returns a Bill for reconsideration.
- Pocket Veto: When a Bill is presented to the President, he / she either gives his / her assent or refuse to give his / her assent. The Constitution does not prescribe any time limit within which the President has to declare his / her assent. The President may simply keep the Bill on his / her table indefinitely. Such action which is neither negative nor positive is called Pocket veto.

Pardon: It Pardon: completely absolves the offender from all sentences, punishments and disqualifications. He / she comes to the same position as if he / she had never committed the crime.

Reprieve: It is t Reprieve:Reprieve: emporary suspension of death sentence generally pending the proceedings for pardon or commutation.

Respite: It Respite:Respite: means awarding a lesser sentence in place of one originally awarded e.g., on the ground of pregnancy of a woman offender.

Remission: Remission: It Remission:reduces the length of sentence without affecting its character i.e. sentence of rigorous imprisonment for two years may be remitted to one year.

Commutation: It Commutation: substitutes one form of punishment for another of a lighter character i.e. death sentence may be commuted to life imprisonment. Rigorous imprisonment can be commuted to simple imprisonment, which in turn may be commuted to fine.

#### **Electoral College (Value of the Vote)**

Article 55 has devised a way by which a value is attached to each vote of a Member of Parliament and Member of Legislative Assembly. This is an attempt to emphasize the federal character of the Office of the President.

The Value of the Vote of an MLA = Populationof theState TotalNo.of MLAs<sup>×</sup> 1 1000

The Value of the Vote of an MP = Valueof Votesof allMLAsof 28States TotalNo.of MPs

The Value of the Vote of an MLA differs from one State to another. This method brings a measure of uniformity among the States and parity between the Union and the States as a whole.

# **VICE PRESIDENT**

Qualifications, Terms and Powers: On the United States of America model, we have a Vice President. But he / she is elected by the Parliament and not by the people as in the case of United States of America. He / she is elected by the Members of both the Houses of Parliament. He / she must be over the age of 35 years, a citizen of India, necessary qualification to be a MP and must have the qualifications which are required to become the President. The term of Office is five years. Whenever the Office of the President falls vacant due to death, resignation or ill health, etc., he / she will assume the Office of the President. However, within six months of time, a new President has to be elected. As in the case of United States of America, he / she cannot remain in the Office for the remaining period of five years term, when the President expires. He / she is the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha and conducts the proceedings of the House in accordance with the rules.

#### **PRIME MINISTER**

Qualifications, Terms and Powers: As indicated by the Constitution, there shall be a Council of Ministers headed by a Prime Minister to aid and the advice the President in matters of administration. He / she is the Leader of the Lok Sabha and it is his / her prerogative to choose ministers; allot portfolios; and decides the size of the Cabinet. He / she can also reshuffle the Cabinet. He / she can demand the resignation of any Minister. When the Prime Minister resigns, the Cabinet is also dissolved. He / she plays an important role in the governance of the country. In the matter of national security, the responsibility is enormous. In external affairs, he / she plays a major role. He / she is a link between the President and the Cabinet. Generally, he / she meets the President in the Rashtrapati Bhavan once in a week.

#### **COUNCIL OF MINISTERS**

Functions:

- Ensuring the smooth functioning of the administration
- Framing the policies of the government and taking decisions accordingly
- Preparing the Union Budget
- Drafting the Bills to be introduced in the Parliament
- Formulating the foreign policy of the Country
- Suggesting Amendments to the Constitution

The meeting of the Union Cabinet is held once in a week. The Prime Minister presides over it. The proceedings of the meeting are kept confidential. However, each Minister is responsible for his / her portfolio and jointly all the Ministers are responsible collectively to the Lok Sabha. The Ministry will remain in the Office only when they command the confidence of the Lok Sabha. When it withdraws the confidence, the Ministry has to resign. The total number of Ministers including the Prime Minister shall not exceed 15% of the total number Members of Lok Sabha (as per 91st Amendment Act, 2003). Ministers may be chosen form the Lok Sabha or Rajya Sabha. A Minister who is member of one House has the right to speak and to take part in the proceedings of the other House. A Minister is allowed to vote only in the House of which he / she is a Member. All the members of the Council of Ministers do not belong to the same rank. The Constitution does not classify Ministers into different ranks but in practice four ranks have come to be recognized:

- Cabinet Ministers: He / she has a right to be present and participate in every meeting of the Cabinet. For proclamation of an emergency under Article 352, the advice must come from the Prime Minister and other Ministers of Cabinet rank.
- Minister of State with Independent charge: He / she is a Minister of State who does not work under a Cabinet Minister. When any matter concerning his / her Department is on the agenda of the Cabinet, he / she is invited to attend the meeting.
- Minister of State: He / she is a Minister who does not have independent charge of any Department and works under a Cabinet Minister. The work to such Minister is allotted by his / her Cabinet Minister.
- Deputy Minister: He / she is a Minister who works under a Cabinet Minister or a Minister of State with Independent charge. The work to him / her is allotted by the Minister under whom he is working.

A person who is not a member of either House may also be appointed as a Minister. He / she can continue as a Minister only for six months (Article 75-5). If he / she desires to continue as Minister he / she has to become a member of any one of the Houses of Parliament before the expiration of the period of six months.

# **C. Union Legislative Procedure**

It is of four types depending on the type of a Bill, which are as follows:

- Ordinary Bill
- Money Bill
- Financial Bill
- Constitution Amendment Bill
- Ordinmy Bill: It may originate in either House of Parliament as per Article 107. A Bill may be introduced either by a Minister or by any other member. When a Bill is introduced by a member other than a Minister then it called a 'Private Member Bill'. If a private member desires to introduce a Bill he / she has to give notice of his / her intention to seek leave of the House to introduce the Bill. The prescribed period of notice is one month. For Ministers notice is not required. If a Bill has been published in the Official Gazette before introduction, no motion for leave to introduce is necessary. A Bill which has not been published prior to its introduction is published after introduction. The motion for leave to introduce is rarely opposed.

Any time after the Bill has been introduced or on any subsequent occasion, the member-incharge of the Bill may take one of the following motions in regard to his / her Bill, namely,

- that it be taken into consideration; or
- that it be referred to a select Committee; or
- that it be referred to a joint Committee of the Houses; or
- that it be circulated for eliciting opinion.

The Bill duly authenticated by the Speaker or the Chairman is presented to the President for his / her assent. The President may,

- assent to the Bill. The Bill then becomes an Act.
- withhold his / her assent. The Bill then ends and does not become an Act.
- return the Bill for reconsideration. If the Houses again pass the Bill with or without amendments and it is presented to the President he / she is obliged to give his / her assent (Article 111).
- Money Bill: It may be introduced only in Lok Sabha. Article 117 prohibits introduction of Money Bill in the Rajya Sabha. It shall not be introduced or moved except on the recommendation of the President. This after being passed by the Lok Sabha is transmitted to the Rajya Sabha. The Rajya Sabha must return the Bill within a period of 14 days from the date of the receipt of the Bill. Article 110 states that a Bill is deemed to be a Money Bill if it contains provisions dealing with all or any of the following matters, namely,
  - The imposition, abolition, remission, alteration or regulation of any tax;
  - The regulation of the borrowing of money or the giving of any guarantee by the Government of India, or the amendment of the law with respect to any financial obligations undertaken or to be undertaken by the Government of India;
  - The custody of the Consolidated Fund or the Contingency Fund of India, the payment of money into or the withdrawal of money from any such Fund;
  - The appropriation of money out of the Consolidated Fund of India;
  - The declaring of any expenditure to be expenditure charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or the increasing of the amount of any such expenditure;
  - The receipt of money on account of the Consolidated Fund of India or the Public Account of India or the custody or issue of such money or the audit of the accounts of the Union or of a State; or
  - Any matter incidental to any of the matters specified in above sub-clauses.
- Financial Bill: It may be any Bill dealing with fiscal matters. Here the determining factor is the Speaker's Certificate. The annual Finance Bill contains many provisions but is treated as a Money Bill because it is so certified and endorsed by the Speaker. It shares two attributes with a Money Bill (a) both of them can originate only in the Lok Sabha and (b) they cannot be introduced without the recommendation of the President. Two types of Financial Bill do not receive the Speaker's Certificate stating that they are Money Bills, namely,
  - A Bill which does not solely deal with matters enumerated in Article 110 and contains other matters also. A Bill that deals with iron ore and also imposes a cess on such ore is a Financial Bill [Article 117(1)].
  - A Bill which contains provisions involving expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of India [Article 117(3)].
- Constitution Amendment Bill: A Bill to amend the Constitution may be introduced in either House of the Parliament. Prior recommendation of the President is not required. This is presented to the President who shall give his / her assent to the

Bill. The President has no option but to assent. This must be passed by each House by special majority prescribed by Article 368. There is no provision for joint sitting.

# **D. Union Judiciary**

In our country, we have a single system of Judiciary. We do not have two types as in the case of United States of America; one for the Center and other for the States. Hence, the Supreme Court of our country is the highest Apex Court and its verdicts are final in the constitutional matters, customs and tradition and earlier decisions of the various courts. The judicial system of a country takes up disputes and gives judgment based on the laws. Both the judiciary and the laws play an important role in the society. The courts of law perform the important task of protecting the life, property, dignity and the rights of the citizens. They are not controlled by either the Legislature or the Executive. They are expected to function impartially and independently. Thus, in any country, judiciary plays the important role of interpreting and applying laws and adjudicating upon controversies between one citizen and another citizen / State – to maintain Rule of Law and to assure that the government runs according to law – in a country with a written Constitution. Judiciary is having additional function of safeguarding the supremacy of the Constitution by interpreting and applying its provisions and keeps all authorities within the constitutional framework.

#### **SUPREME COURT**

It consists of the Chief Justice of India and other 25 other Judges. It is created by an Act of Parliament (Article 124) and located in New Delhi. The Chief Justice and Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President. He / she should be a citizen of India. He / she should have been a High Court Judge for at least five years or an Advocate of the High Court for at least ten years, or a distinguished Jurist. The age of retirement of Judge is 65. After his / her retirement, he / she cannot practice as an Advocate in any Court. If the Judges are found guilty while discharging their duties, they can be removed from their Office by the President. The Acting Chief Justice can be appointed by the President, if the Office of the Chief Justice of India falls vacant or he / she is unable to perform his / her duties due to absence or otherwise.

(The Constitution as enacted in 1950 provided that the Court shall consist of the Chief Justice and not more than 7 other Judges. The number of Judges was increased to 10 in 1956, 13 in 1960, 17 in 1977 and 25 in 1986).

#### Functions:

- Resolving the disputes between the Union and the States, and between the States
- Issuing Writs to safe guard the Fundamental Rights of the citizens
- Interpreting the Provisions of the Constitution
- Giving advice to the President of India

#### Powers:

It has two types of cases to be tackled:

Original Jurisdiction: Refers to direct cases that come to them from the parties of dispute

Appellate Jurisdiction: Refer to those which on decided at lower courts and referred for review

Attorney-General of India: Attorney-General of India: He is Attorney-General of India:the first Law Officer of the Government of India. His duty shall be to give advice on such legal matters and to perform such other duties of a legal character as many, from time to time, be referred or assigned to him by the President. There is no right to vote in the Parliament. He must have the same qualifications as are required to be a Judge of the Supreme Court.

Comptroller and oller oller and Auditor Auditor-General of India: -General of He is the person to control the entire financial system of the country (both Union & States). He is the guardian of the public purse and shall be the impartial head of the audit and accounts system of India. He must have the same qualifications as are required to be a Judge of the Supreme Court.

# **THE STATE GOVERNMENT**

India is a Union of States. Today, there are 28 States. Other than these, there are six centrally-administered Territories. Our Constitution provides for the Government of the Union as well as the Government of 27 States (Total is 28). The State of Jammu & Kashmir was allowed to frame its own Constitution. In Jammu & Kashmir, the Parliamentary form of Government has been adopted and the Executive Head is the Governor. Part VI of the Constitution lays down a uniform structure for all the States. Generally, the State Governments follow the model of the Central Government. There are minor variations. The Legislature in four States (Bihar, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh) is Bicameral. All the remaining States have only one House called as Unicameral. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Punjab have abolished the Legislative Council.

The three organs of the State Government are Legislature, Executive and Judiciary.

The aim of the Judiciary is to provide justice to the people. Each State will have High Court as per the Constitution. Some bigger States have High Court Benches in another city of their State. Smaller States are attached to nearby big State High Courts. The Chief Justice of High Court is appointed by the President of India in consultation with the Governor of the State and the Chief Justice of India. Other Judges of the High Court are appointed by consulting the High Court Chief Justice and the Governor. As on the year 2000, there are 21 High Courts in our country. Either English or regional language is used in the High Court. They are given salary and facilities like house, car and pension. He can also resign or can be removed from the Office by an order from the President.

#### **Subordinate / Lower Courts**

Under the Indian Judiciary, there are several Subordinate Courts. The High Courts function under the Supreme Court. The Subordinate Courts, which function under the High Courts, include District and Sessions Judges Courts, City Courts, Taluk-level / Munisiff Courts, Judicial Magistrate, Metropolitan Magistrate, and Nyaya Panchayats.

The Subordinate Courts are of two types:

- Civil Court: It takes up matters such as money transactions, property & contracts, and pass judgment.
- Criminal Court: It takes up matters such as murder, theft & robbery, and passes judgments.

The High Court has the power to admit appeals in civil and criminal cases from the Subordinate Courts. Hence, appeals may be made to the High court against the judgments given by the Lower Courts. Similarly, appeals may be made to the Supreme Court against the judgments given by the High Courts.

#### **Lok Adalat**

Under our present Judicial system, the legal procedure is complicated, expensive and time-consuming. As an alternative, the government has set up other forms of legal institutions that function faster and are less expensive. One of them is the Lok Adalat.

The State and District-level Officers organize Lok Adalats, from time to time, at places convenient to the people. They take up cases from the parties which can be settled amicably. The judgment is as good as the judgment given by the Civil Courts. It is worth noting that the judgment is not only final but also binding on both the parties. No appeal can be made against such judgment in any higher court. This saves time and money.

#### **Special Status of the State of Jammu & Kashmir**

In Article 370, a special constitutional position is given to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Even though it is one of the States of the Indian Union; all the provisions of the Constitution of India relating to the States in the First Schedule are not applicable to it.

Some change was made for Jammu & Kashmir due to the peculiarities of its accession to Indian Union. Moreover even after its accession, many leaders of the Jammu & Kashmir State were hobnobbing with Pakistan to join Pakistan. Having regard to the circumstances in which the State acceded to India, the Government of India had declared that it was the people of the State of Jammu & Kashmir, acting through their Constituent Assembly, who were to finally determine the Constitution of the State and the jurisdiction of the Union of

India. The applicability of the provision of the Constitution regarding this State was, accordingly to be in the nature of an interim arrangement. This is the summary of provisions given under Article 370:

- Until 1965, the Chief Minister was called as Prime Minister of Jammu & Kashmir State and the Governor was called "Sardar-i-Riyasat".
- Parliament cannot make any law without the consent of the Legislature of the State of Jammu & Kashmir, where that State is to be affected by such legislation. This speaks of its autonomy.
- A Proclamation of Emergency declared by the President (Article 352) on the ground of internal disturbance shall be effective in Jammu & Kashmir State only with the consent of its State Legislature.
- No decision affecting the disposition of the State can be made by the Government of India without the consent of the State Government.
- The Union shall have no powers to proclamation of Financial Emergency with respect to the State of Jammu & Kashmir under Article 360.
- Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles The Provisions of Part IV of the Constitution of India relating to the Directive Principles of State Policy do not apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. The provision of Article 19 are subject to special restrictions for a period of 25 years. Special rights as regards employment, acquisition of property and settlement have been conferred on 'permanent residents' of the State by inserting a new Article 35A.
- Separate Constitution for the State of Jammu & Kashmir While the Constitution for any of the other States of the Union of India is laid down in Part VI of the Constitution of India, the State of Jammu & Kashmir has its own Constitution, made by a separate Committee and promulgated in 1957.
- This Constitution can be amended by only Jammu & Kashmir Assembly with twothirds majority.
- No alternations of the area or boundaries of this State can be made by the Parliament without the consent of the Legislature of the State of Jammu & Kashmir.

# **Adult Franchise / Suffrage System**

In a democracy, every citizen has a right to vote. Right of voting is the essence of democracy. Irrespective of caste, creed, race, religion, language and sex, all those who have completed the age of eighteen years are extended the voting right in India and called as Universal Adult Franchise System.

India has Adult Franchise System. According to the 61st Amendment, which came into force during 1989, the age of eligibility for voting was reduced from 21 to 18 years. Every citizen has the right to vote. When the number of candidates contests for elections, selecting a good candidate is not an easy task. In such cases, the citizen should be very careful and use his / her discretion to choose a proper person. It is a challenging task to the voter; because he has to choose a good person who is loyal and service-minded and devoted to the public cause. The voter has to identify a party which is good for the progress of the nation and vote for its candidate. Voters should not come under the influence of money, muscle power, caste, creed, race, religion, etc.

The winning candidates (to whichever party they belong) should devote themselves towards the progress of their electorate. The candidates, after elections, should not change their party as it would destabilize the government's functions. The elected candidates should be a model of selfless service, honesty and cooperation.

One of the outstanding features of the Constitution is Adult Suffrage. It means that every person — who is not less than eighteen years of age, has the right to vote in the election to the House of the People and the State Legislative Assembly. The only grounds for disqualification are:

- Non-residence
- Unsoundness of mind
- Crime
- Corrupt or illegal practice

This provision has been hailed as the "Foundation Spring of Indian's Democracy". For, it has swept away at one stroke all the antiquated and undemocratic qualifications prescribed to be eligible for voting — property, income, status, title, educational qualifications and like.

The cumulative effect of the above two provisions on democracy in India is indeed far-reaching. The principle of one man, one vote, and one value has become a constitutional right. The removal of the notorious system of communal electorates which had broken up Indian society statutorily into religious and communal compartments is in perfect harmony with the establishment of adult suffrage. As a result, the citizens of India will vote as individuals and not as Hindus, Muslims, Christians, or Sikhs.

#### Importance of Adult Franchise System

- It is complementary to democracy and its functions
- There is scope for electing mature candidates
- It helps the citizen to understand the responsibilities in governance
- It enables to ascertain the opinion of the people
- It provides the opportunity to the various sections of the society to know public problems and make them aware of their interests
- The right of voting is enjoyed by all

It shall be the rule for elections. In other words, if a citizen is eighteen years of age on the date fixed by the Legislature and disqualified by any law, he/she is entitled to be registered as a voter. The common disqualifications are based on unsoundness of mind, conviction for crime, corrupt practice at an election, etc. They are contained in the Representation of People Act. It means that barring exceptions every citizen who is an adult possesses the right to vote. A person may be registered as a voter in only one constituency. He must also be ordinarily resident in the constituency in which he desires to be registered. Seats have been reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. There is a provision for nomination of not more than two members of the Anglo-Indian community in the Lok Sabha and one member in a State Assembly. Apart from these, there is no reservation for any religion or community.

#### **Electoral Process**

The Preamble to the Constitution declares that India is a DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC. This implies that all citizens who are eligible to vote will have the right to participate in the elections. We have a Parliamentary form of Government so the party securing a major share of the votes of the citizens or a coalition of parties who are able to obtain support of a majority of Legislators in the popular House (Lok Sabha or Legislative Assembly, as the case may be) form the Government. The vote in an election is the cherished right of every citizen in a democracy. Right of Voting is the essence of democracy. Irrespective of caste, creed, race, religion, language and sex, all those who have completed the age of 18 years are extended the voting right in India and we call it as "Universal Adult Franchise" system (reduced the age from 21 to 18 years in the 61st Amendment, 1989).

Every citizen has the right to vote. When the number of candidates contests for the elections, selecting a good candidate is not an easy task. In such cases, the citizen should be very careful and use his / her discretion to select a proper person. It is a challenging task to the voter because he / she has to choose a good person who is loyal and service-minded and devoted to the public cause. The voter has to identify a party which is good for the progress of the nation and vote for its candidate. Voters should not come under the influence of money, muscle power, caste, race, religion, etc. The winning candidates should devote themselves towards the progress of their electorate. The candidates, after elections, should not change their party as it would destabilize the government's functions. The elected candidates should be a model of selfless service, honesty and cooperation.

India has Representative form of Government. The representatives are elected. There is an Election Commission in India, to conduct elections from time to time. Till 1989, it consisted of the Chief Election Commissioner alone. In 1989, one more Commissioner was added. On 1st October, 1993, provision was made to appoint two Commissioners. Thus the Election Commission at the Center has one Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commissioners. They are appointed by the President. The Election Commission has conducted the regular and by-elections to the Parliament and State Legislatures. The Commissioners has an appointment for a term of 6 years or till the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier.

Elections in India are more than a process of voting someone to rule the nation. Since independence, Elections in India have evolved a long way, but all along Elections have been a significant cultural aspect on Independent India. It is more like a festival, an indication of jubilance, a show of loyalty, a change of power, and above all ensuring the importance of the individual in a democracy, the voter. It is a very elaborate process, that the size of the huge electoral mandates the Elections to be conducted in a number of phases. It involves a number of step-by-step processes from announcement of Election dates by the Election Commission of India, which brings into force the 'Model Code of Conduct' for the political parties, to the announcement of results and the submission of the list of successful candidates to the Executive Head of the State (The Governor) or the Center (The President). The submission of results marks the end of the Election process, thereby paving way for the formation of the new Government.

# The EC performs the following functions

- Election of the President of India and Vice President of India
- The Union Parliament and the composition of its two Chambers (Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha)
- Qualifications of Members of Parliament
- Composition of the State Legislatures
- Qualifications of Members of the State Legislatures
- Duration of the Parliament and the State Legislatures
- Elections to the Parliament and the State Legislatures
- Reservations of seats in the House of the People and the State Assemblies for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
- The determination of population for purposes of election
- Preparation of electoral rolls; Conduct of the elections; Counting of votes and Declaration of results
- Advice the President in regard to the question whether a Member of Parliament (Article 103) or Member of Legislative Assembly has become subject to any disqualification (Article 192)
- Advice the President in the appointment of Regional Commissioners at State level

Elections are conducted by secret ballot. The contesting candidates are assigned different symbols so that even an illiterate voter can vote by identifying the symbol. Recently, Electronic Voting Machines are introduced. According to the People's Representatives Act, all matters of dispute arising in the elections are settled by the Supreme Court of India or a High Court. The elections are conducted according to the calendar of events prepared and published by the Election Commission.

# **Stages of Election Process in India**

Pre-Elections: Before the Elections, the Election Commission announces the dates of nomination, polling and counting. The model code of conduct comes in force from the day the dates are announced. The model code of conduct is a code of conduct mutually agreed upon by various parties to be followed during the Elections. The code of conduct specifies that the Union and State Governments cannot announce any major sops to the electorate to prevent any unfair swings in the voting pattern. No party is allowed to use the Government resources for campaigning. Candidates are required to declare their assets, age, educational qualifications and criminal history. Convicted criminals are debarred from standing in the Elections as well as disfranchised. Persons still on trail may contest, but can be debarred if found guilty. The code of conduct stipulates that campaigning be stopped 48 hours prior to polling day.

 Like-minded political parties form alliances and seat-sharing arrangements in each State. Alliances are even formed after the Elections to enable Government formation. It is not unlikely to see parties having won mandate from people on opposing platforms come together for the sake of power. This negates the democratic aspect of the exercise and at times the common voter ends up with a Government which he may have voted against in large number. The seat-sharing arrangement helps the alliance field a candidate from one party to prevent splitting of the votes. For a long time, extravagant electoral spending by the parties and candidates alike had much impact on vote swing. The stakes in the Elections are so huge that extravagant spending by political parties ranged from putting up huge hoardings, posting posters on walls, and giving freebies (political parties used to give colour televisions and gold / silver coins as gifts) during canvassing. Today, the model code of conduct theoretically bans such extravagant spending during canvassing, aims to protect voters from harassment by the parties and also imposes ban on use of loudspeakers after 10.00 p.m.

- Voting Day: Campaigning ends the day before the voting day. Government schools and colleges are chosen to be the polling stations. The day of the Elections is declared a holiday and all liquor shops and bars are shut down. The Collector of each District is in charge of polling. Government servants are employed to many of the polling stations. Electronic Voting Machines are being increasingly used instead of ballot boxes to prevent Election fraud via booth capturing, which is heavily prevalent in certain parts of India. An indelible ink manufactured by the Mysore Paints and Varnish Limited is applied usually on the left index finger of the voter as an indicator that the voter has cast his / her vote. This practice has been followed since the 1962 General Elections and prevents bogus voting.
- Post Elections: After the Election day, the Electronic Voting Machines are stored in strong room under heavy security. After the different phases of the Elections are complete, a day is set to count the votes. The votes are tallied and typically, the verdict is known within a few hours. The candidate who has mustered the most votes is declared the winner of the constituency. The party or coalition that has won the most seats is invited by the President or Governor to form the new Government at Union or State level respectively. This group must prove its majority in the floor of the House (Lok Sabha or State Legislative Assembly) in a vote of confidence by obtaining a simple majority (minimum 50%) of the votes in the House.

# **Process of Election**

1. Submission of Nominations: President in case of Lok Sabha and the Governor in the case of Legislatures, issue the Notification of election. The contesting candidates are expected to submit their nominations before the Returning Officer, before the prescribed date. Every nomination should be accompanied by a deposit as prescribed. Deposit money is forfeited in case the candidate does not get the minimum number of votes prescribed.

- 2. Scrutiny of Nominations: The contesting candidates should properly fill up the Nomination Forms and satisfy the various conditions prescribed by the Election Commission. During the process of scrutiny, all such issues are examined. After such scrutiny alone, the names of the eligible candidates to the election are announced.
- 3. Withdrawal of Nomination: The contesting candidates are given a chance to withdraw their nominations. A date is fixed for this purpose.
- 4. Election Propaganda: After the declaration of the names of the contesting candidates, propaganda / canvass work starts to woo the electorate. The independent candidates belonging no political parties are also contest in elections. Meetings, rallies, processions, pamphlets and other means of communication used for the purpose of wooing the voters. All such election campaigns must come to end before 36 hours of commencing polling. However, one is allowed to go from house to house and carry on the propaganda work. (or, campaigning must be stopped 48 hours prior to polling day).
- 5. Election Day: For the sake of the voters, the Election Commission has created a number of election booths. On the day of election, the voters can go to their nearest prescribed booth and exercise their vote. To carry out the election work, a number of Officers are appointed. Security arrangements are also made. A voters' list is prepared. With the help of the list, Officers are able to identify the voters. The list contains the name, sex, age and address of the voters. Recently, the Election Commission has insisted on providing Identification Cards to the voters. The agents of various political parties are present in the booth during elections and their job is to identify the voters and check malpractices. Voters cast their votes through ballot paper or voting machines as the case may be. The ballot paper consists the names and symbols of the candidates, which helps the voter. The sealed ballot boxes / voting machines are given tight security for the day of counting.
- 6. Counting of Votes: A number of counting centers are created and in the presence of the candidates or their agents, the sealed boxes / machines are opened for counting. One who gets the majority is declared as Winner. There is scope for recounting under special circumstances. The election disputes can be settled through courts.

(NOTE: After elections and after the announcement of the results, the Chief Election Commissioner issues the notification that 'New Lok Sabha' has been duly constituted. Similarly, State Chief Electoral Officer of the State issues a notification that 'New Assembly' has been duly constituted).

#### **Panchayat Raj System / Local Self-Government / Self-Help Government**

Local Self-government system prevailed in our country from a long time. It is described as the pillars of village administration. Under this system, every village was self-sufficient and whole administration was in the hands of Panchayat, whose head was called 'Sarpanch'. 'Panch' means 'five' and Panchayat consisted of only five members in early days. Later the number increased but the word 'Panchayat' remained.

If the Constitution is a framework for federal structure then the power is shared between two sets of Government. One at the Center called the Union or the Federal Government and other called State or Provincial Government. So Indian Constitution has the unique distinction of containing provisions regarding government at three levels: (a) Union, (b) State, and (c) Local.

India is a democratic nation. Under democracy, the people must be aware of the administration system. Such knowledge is provided by Panchayat system. The various local self-governing units like Panchayats, Municipalities and Corporations are the local selfgoverning units which impart education of democracy because the first lessons of democracy are learnt there.

In 1957, Balwant Rai Mehta Committee suggested the mode of formation of Panchayat Raj. Its recommendations were accepted by the Government. Rajasthan was the first State to introduce the Panchayat Raj System in the country. But when the expected results did not come, a Committee was appointed under the Chairmanship of Sadiq Ali in 1964 to report on the working of the Panchayat Raj System in Rajasthan. It was found that the major cause was lack of people's participation, which in turn was the result of ignorance, poverty, caste divisions and scarcity of financial resources.

Panchayat Raj System: Every village and town has their own peculiar problems. It is difficult to find solutions for them unless they meet and discuss them and bring their decision in to force. This work is called 'Grama Rajya' or 'Panchayat Raj'. In order to make the life of a village happy, people belonging to that place should take part in its activities. For this local participation, devolution or decentralization of power is necessary. Action can be taken only when power is given to the local people. It is to carry out such programmes of developing villages, that Panchayat Raj System is introduced.

It is for the progress and development of the villages that both the Central and State Governments have implemented the Panchayat Raj System. India is a country with full of villages. The progress and development of India is possible only with the development of villages. The dream of Gandhiji was 'Gram Swaraj'. This he called 'Suraj'. Gandhiji in his book 'India of my dream' has explained the concept of 'Swarajya', which was his ideal or popularly known as 'Rama Rajya'.

The main aims of Panchayat Raj System are as follows:

- To give more power to people in administration
- Introduce decentralization of power in administration
- Work for the comprehensive progress of a village

It is with this purpose, a comprehensive Amendment was introduced in 1983. This new Act was known as Panchayat Raj Act which came into force on 14th August, 1985. Under this Act, Zilla Parishad, Taluk Panchayat Council, Mandal Panchayat and Nyaya Panchayat came into force. The aim of this Act was to strengthen the Panchayat Raj. Thus, the Constitution under 73rd Amendment Act, 1992 inserted Part IX which contains provisions for Panchayats. It gives Constitutional status to Panchayats and provides guidelines to the States to enact detailed supplementary laws. All the States and Union Territories excepting Jammu & Kashmir, Delhi and Arunachal Pradesh have enacted such laws. In Nagaland, Meghalaya and Mizoram, a parallel set of institutions exist under the Schedules 5 and 6 of the Constitution.

Local Administration in Village: There are two kinds of Village Administrative Institutions; one is for a village and the other for town. On 1st November, 1959 i.e. the Rajyotsava Day, Mysore Grama Panchayat and Local Self-governing Units Act was introduced. It consisted of three-tier system, i.e. Village Panchayats at Village level, Taluk Development Boards at Taluk level, and at the District level, District Development Council. The Grama Panchayat and Taluk Development Boards consist of elected representatives and District Development Council consists only with officials.

Under Panchayat Raj System, the role of Grama Panchayat is very important. The progress and development of the village depends on it. It is called the pillar of 'Grama Swarajya' or 'Grama Suraj'. Under this new Act, villages with five to seven thousand population and the adjacent small villages join together to create a Grama Panchayat. Whereas in Malnad and hilly areas, villages having a population of 2500 are allowed to form Grama Panchayat. Every four hundred residents will have one representative and they are elected by voters, whose age is above eighteen years. The term of the Office is for five years. The elections to these Panchayats are conducted on non-party basis. It also provides reservation for the posts of President and Vice President of all the Village, Taluk and Zilla Panchayats. It provides an opportunity to the women of backward and weaker sections of the society for becoming the President and Vice President. The Panchayat is expected to meet at least once in two months. It can create Sub-committees to look after or supervise the work of the Panchayat.

Taluk Panchayat: Under this Act, every revenue Taluk will have a Taluk Panchayat. This consists of the elected members of the Taluk Panchayat. For every 1000 persons, one representative is elected from the rural areas. In addition, the local Member of Legislative Assembly, Member of Legislative Council, and Member of Parliament are also members. Besides 1/5th of the Presidents of Grama Panchayats are appointed on rotation basis for a period of one year. Thus seats are reserved like: 18% for Scheduled Castes, 5% for Scheduled Tribes and 33% for Other Backward Classes. An overall 33% seats are reserved for women. In the Council, there must be at least eleven elected members. To carry out the work in an effective manner, three Standing Committees are constituted viz., General Ad hoc Committee; Finance and Planning Committee; and Social Justice Committee.

Zilla Panchayat: It is one of the important units of Panchayat Raj System at the district level. A member for every 40000 people is elected for Zilla Panchayat. But in the cases of Malnad, hilly areas, one member is elected for 30000 people. In addition, the Members of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha who represent the district and the Members of the Legislature (Assembly and Council) are the members of the Zilla Panchayat. Grama Panchayat Presidents (1/5th in rotation) are also its members. The term of Office is five years.

The Scheduled and Tribal Areas: Our Constitution contains special provisions for administration and control of certain areas which have been named as Scheduled Areas and also for Scheduled Tribes even though such areas form part of a State or Union Territory. The reason was that these areas are comparatively backward and inhabited by a tribe. It was also a step towards preserving their culture and protecting them from exploitation. At the same time, the government allowed a free hand to foreign missionaries to convert these tribes to Christianity by exploiting their poverty, ignorance and inaccessibility to other Indians. As a result of this policy, these tribes are even 55 years after the commencement of the Constitution far away from the mainstream and have developed a vested interest in separatism. Some of them are supplied arms by foreign powers which they use in killing fellow citizens. Nagaland and Tripura are paradigm examples of the results of this policy.

The 5th Schedule is applicable to Scheduled Areas and Scheduled Tribes in all States excepting Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram. The President has the power to declare any area to be Scheduled Area. The Governor has special responsibility in regard to such areas. He / she required to report to the President annually or whenever so required by the President regarding the administration of the Scheduled Areas. The Union may give direction to the States in regard to the administration of such areas. Each State has a Tribes Advisory Council consisting of not more than 20 members of whom ¾th shall be the representatives of Scheduled Tribes in the Legislative Assembly of the State. It is the duty of the Council to advise on matters pertaining to the welfare and advancement of the Scheduled tribes referred by the Governor.
