## **FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES**

**Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties – Content and Significance – Special Provisions created in the Constitution for SCs / Scheduled Tribes (Dalits), OBCs, Women, Children and the Religious and Linguistic Minorities**

## **Fundamental Rights**

As citizens of India, we are all assured some fundamental rights and duties. 'Fundamental Rights' protects us from injustice and 'Fundamental Duties' enables us to contribute to the welfare of the nation.

Rights: The privileges given to the citizens are their rights. Some are natural rights (like the right to live, right to self protection) and some others are legal rights (like right to equality, right to education). Rights are the bases of a democratic country.

Fundamental Rights: The Indian Constitution has given certain Fundamental Rights to all the citizens. These have been specified in the Constitution. They have also been guaranteed and supported by law. The Fundamental Rights comes under the Part III of the Constitution of India. It is necessary for every individual to live a complete and satisfactory life. All citizens are assured SIX Fundamental Rights. They are as follows:

1. Right to Equality: Here, all are equal before the law and also nobody is above the law. All should get equal protection of the law. It states that all citizens should be treated as equals irrespective of religion, race, caste, gender, or birth of place. It means there is supremacy of law or 'Rule of Law'. No citizen shall be subject to any restrictions with regard to access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, places of public entertainment, worship places, on the use of wells, tanks, roads and other public places. All citizens enjoy equal opportunities to take up government employment.

Under this right, Untouchability is an offence. Insulting the members of Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes by calling them 'untouchables' is an offence.

- 2. Right to Freedom: The Constitution has listed SIX types of freedom:
  - Freedom of Speech and Expression
  - Freedom to Assemble Peacefully
  - Freedom to form Associations
  - Freedom to move freely throughout India
  - Freedom to reside and settle in any part of India
  - Freedom to practice any Profession, Occupation, Trade or Business

The Constitution itself has specified certain circumstances under which individual freedoms may be restricted.

- 3. Right against Exploitation: The aim is to prevent exploitation of women, children and the weak. The Union and State Governments have enacted several laws to prevent exploitation. For instance, both, giving and receiving dowry is punishable under the law; the system of bonded labor, and has been prohibited; employment of children in mining, manufacture of beedi and fire-works and such other dangerous occupations is prohibited. This is meant to protect members of the weaker sections. The governments has not only prohibited child labor, but has also made education compulsory up to the age of Fourteen. All children, irrespective of gender, caste and religion, must now attend school.
- 4. Right to Freedom of Religion: Since India is a secular country, every citizen has a right to practice and propagate his / her religion. However, the State may impose restrictions in the interests of public order, morality and health.
- 5. Cultural and Educational Rights: This protects the interests of religious and linguistic minorities. They have the right to protect their language, script or culture. They may establish and administer their own educational institutions. For example, in Tamil Nadu, the Kannadigas (who are minority) have the right to establish Kannada medium schools. The Tamilians in Karnataka also have similar rights.
- 6. Right to Constitutional Remedies: The Constitution has not only given Fundamental Rights to the citizens of India but also guaranteed them. When rights are violated, the citizens appeal to the court of law for their protection. The court of law is empowered to enforce the Fundamental Rights. On any matter relating to a Fundamental Right, a citizen may file a petition in the High Court / Supreme Court. Such petitions are known as Writ Petitions.

In brief, the Fundamental Right forms the basis of our democratic system. However, the government is empowered to restrict them in the interests of the national security and socioeconomic progress. The Indian Parliament may even curtail or suspend Fundamental Rights under certain extraordinary circumstances. Fundamental Right is from Articles 12 to 35 in the Constitution of India.

[NOTE: Articles 31, 31D and 32A has been repealed by Amendments]

#### **Meaning of 'Life and Personal Liberty'**

Life is not mere animal existence or survival. It would include the right to live with human dignity and all those aspects of life which go to make a man's life meaningful, complete and worth living. The expression personal liberty covers a wide variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberties of a man other than those which are already included in Article 19. The courts are inclined to give the widest amplitude to the expression. On account of the liberal interpretation, Article 21 has now come to be invoked almost as a residuary right, even to the extent which the founding fathers never dreamt of. From the judgments of the Supreme Court, the following are some of the rights that are to be read in Article 21:

- Right not to be subjected to bonded labour
- Right to livelihood by means which are not illegal, immoral or opposed to public policy
- Right to decent environment
- Right to shelter
- Right to travel abroad
- Right to speedy trial
- Right to legal aid
- Right to privacy
- Right against solitary confinement
- Right against bar fetters
- Right against handcuffing
- Right against delayed execution
- Right against custodial violence
- Right to education
- Right to pure drinking water
- Right to good roads
- Right to reputation
- Freedom from noise pollution

#### **Protection against Arrest**

Article 21 guarantees right to life and personal liberty. A law may be enacted by a Legislature depriving a person of his / her right. Article 22 sets out certain limitations upon the powers of the Legislature. If a law contravenes the conditions or limitations prescribed by Article 22 the law would be a nullity. Article 22 is not a complete code. It has to be construed with Article 21. Article 22 has two parts. The first part consists of Clauses (1) and (2) those Clauses apply to all arrests made under any law except under a law of preventive detention. The rights flowing from this Article in case of ordinary arrests are:

- Right to be informed of the ground of arrest
- Right to consult and be defended by a lawyer

- Right to be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of his arrest (excluding the time of journey)
- Right not to be detained for more than 24 hours without the authority of a Magistrate

The above rights are not available to (a) an enemy alien and (b) a person detained under a Law of Preventive Detention.

The second part of Article 22 comprising of Clauses (4) and (5) provide safeguards to detenues under a Law for Preventive Detention. It is noteworthy that these safeguards are available even to enemy aliens. Preventive Detention is the detention of a person where the evidence against him is not sufficient for his conviction by a court but is sufficient to justify his detention for reasons of defence, foreign affairs, State security, maintenance of public order, etc. Punitive Detention punishes a person for something done by him. Preventive Detention prevents a person from doing something. Preventive Detention is a precaution taken by the Executive.

Our Constitution considers that preventive detention is a necessity, but it must be subject to limitations to prevent misuse. Examples of laws providing for preventive detention are —

- Preventive Detention Act, 1950 (Repealed)
- Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA), 1971 (Repealed)
- Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), 1974
- National Security Act (NSA), 1980
- Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 2002

#### **Fundamental Duties**

The Fundamental Rights and Fundamental Duties are like the two faces of a coin. The Fundamental Duties are one's obligations towards the country. When citizens voluntarily perform them, the country is sure to make rapid progress. The Fundamental Duties (Article 51A) did not form part of the Constitution as originally adopted. They were included on 11th December, 1976 by the 42nd Amendment. None of the major democracies like United States of America, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, etc. contain a table of Fundamental Duties.

The Duties (10 + 01\* = 11) of the citizens enumerated are as follows:

- 1. To abide / respect by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem
- 2. To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom
- 3. To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India
- 4. To defend the country / motherland and render national service when called upon to do so
- 5. To promote harmony and spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities; to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women

- 6. To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture
- 7. To protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wild life, and to have compassion for living creatures
- 8. To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform
- 9. To safeguard the public property and to abjure violence
- 10. To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavor and achievement
- 11. \* Who is a parent or guardian to provide opportunities for education to his child or, as the case may be, ward between the age of six and fourteen years

[\* Inserted by the Constitutional (86th Amendment) Act, 2002]

#### **Standards in Public Life**

It is the duty of every citizen to obey the constitutional mandate. Every holder of a Public Office has superadded to his / her duties as a citizen the additional duties imposed by virtue of the Office he / she hold. Sensitivity of all enforcement agencies is essential for realizing the promise held out in the Constitution. It is important to draw our attention to "The Seven Principles of Public Life" contained in the First Report of the United Kingdom's Committee on Standards in Public Life —Volume-I by Lord Nolan, Chairman of the Committee, which is reproduced below:

- Selflessness: Holders of Public Office should take decisions solely in the terms of the public interest. They should not do so in order to gain financial or other material benefits for themselves, their family or their friends.
- Integrity: Holders of Public Office should not place themselves under any financial or other obligation to outside individuals or organizations that might influence them in the performance of their official duties.
- Objectivity: In carrying out public business, including making public appointments, awarding contracts, or recommending individuals for rewards and benefits, holders of Public Office should make choices on merit only.
- Accountability: Holders of Public Office are accountable for their decisions and actions to the public and must submit themselves to whatever scrutiny is appropriate to their Office.
- Openness: Holders of Public Office should be as open as possible about all the decisions and actions that they take. They should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands.
- Honesty: Holders of Public Office have a duty to declare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve any conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.
- Leadership: Holders of Public Office should promote and support these principles by leadership and example.

#### **Constitutional Provisions**

#### **Provisions for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes**

The President of India has the power (Article 341) to declare with respect to any State or Union Territory the castes, races, or tribes or parts of or groups within the castes, etc. as Scheduled Castes in relation to a State or Union Territory. Similarly, under Article 342, the President has the power to specify the tribes or tribal communities or groups within them as Scheduled Tribes in relation to State or Union Territory. In case of a State, the President must consult to the Governor of the State.

Article 330 ordains that seats shall be reserved in the Lok Sabha for Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes. Similar reservation is made in case of Legislative Assembly. The number of seats reserved shall be in proportion to their population in the State or Union Territory. Until 2001, there were 119 seats reserved in the house of the people for these communities. 79 seats were reserved for the Scheduled Castes and 40 seats for the Scheduled Tribes. Such reservation was originally to continue till 1960 but by successive Amendments it has now been extended till 2010.

Both the Central and State Governments have taken up special provisions and plans for the socioeconomic development of these classes. Every five year plan has the budgetary allocation for the development and improvement of the standard of living of these classes. In 1978, the Minority Commission was set up to look up continuously the problems of minorities and suggesting remedial measures by the Government of India.

Article 338 provided for appointment for a National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. By the 87th Amendment Act, 2003, a new Article has been inserted (Article 338A). Henceforth there will be two Commissions, i.e., National Commission for Scheduled Castes and National Commission for Scheduled Tribes. These Commissions will consist of a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson and three other members. These commissions have been assigned the following duties:

- To investigate and monitor all matters relating to the safeguards provided under the Constitution or by any other law or any order of the Government
- To inquire into specific complaints with respect to deprivation of the rights
- To participate and advise on the planning process of socioeconomic development of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes
- To present to the President an Annual Report on the working of the safeguards
- To make such recommendations in the report as to the measures that should be taken by the Union or any State for the effective implementation of the safeguards
- To discharge such other functions as the President may specify

The condition of certain castes in India like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was pitiable. Great thinkers and reformers like Buddha, Basaveshwara, Dayananda Saraswathi, Gandhiji and Dr. Ambedkar fought against this evil. Fully bearing this background in mind, the makers of our Constitution have provided many Provisions to assure equality, liberty

and social justice. They have embedded these ideas in the Preamble of the Constitution with following Provisions, which are as follows:

- Some seats are reserved in the State Assemblies and Lok Sabha
- Some Constituencies are declared reserved from these can contest
- Certain percentage of jobs in the Government and Educational institutions are reserved (15% for Scheduled Castes and 7.5% for Scheduled Tribes)
- Special and Mobile Courts have been setup to safeguard the rights and also disposal of cases relating to the practice of untouchability

In the field of education, care is taken to provide all facilities like supply of free books by opening Book Banks. Free boarding and lodging facilities are provided by opening Hostels. The Government is giving Scholarships to these students. Employment Exchange Offices have been opened for the disabled Scheduled Castes / Scheduled Tribes. Also, elaborate measures have been taken up to improve their standard of life in the field of agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry and small scale industries. Now, these people have occupied key positions in administration, education, law and order, etc. this is a good sign.

#### **Provisions for Women**

Our Constitution has granted the 'Right to Equality' to all citizens, including women. However, in many ways, women are denied this right and they are discriminated against. For example, there are more non-literate women than men. More boys get to complete high school than girls, girls do more domestic work than boys, and taking the population as a whole there are more men than women. Why these differences are?

 During the last two centuries, various measures are taken to improve the status of women in India. Social reformers like Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Swami Dayananda Saraswathi, Rabindranath Tagore, Annie Besant, Eswarchandra Vidyasagar, Gandhiji, Sarojini Naidu, etc. have rendered yeomen service for the cause of women's upliftment. Women's education, abolition of child marriage, abolition of sati and legal provision for widow marriage are the various steps taken to improve the conditions of women.

According to the Marriage Act of 1954, the age is fixed at 21 years for men and 18 years for women. Inter-caste marriages are encouraged. Under Article 23, prohibiting traffic of in human beings and forced labour like beggary and similar forms shall be an offence punishable in accordance with law. Dowry Prevention Act of 1961 abolishes dowry system. Under Child Marriage Restraint Act, child marriage is illegal and steps are taken to prevent it. There is a provision for 33% reservation of seats for women in all the local bodies. Under the Indira Women Welfare Programme, many schemes have been developed for the welfare of the women. In 1998, 'Shtree Shakthi' scheme was enforced for the development of rural women. 'Balika Samruddi Yojana' was enforced to protect women from sexual harassment and the 'Rastreeya Mahila Vimochana' was introduced. The year 2001 was declared as the 'Year of the Women Empowerment' to the promotion of the development of women.

After Independence, various measures have been taken by the Government to improve the status of women. Some of them are:

- In matters of public employment, equal opportunities are provided for both men and women by the Constitution (Articles 14 & 15)
- The education of girls stressed by creating various facilities by the government
- Adult Education Centers for women have been opened
- A Commission is constituted for the welfare of women and children
- Polygamy is discouraged by law
- Child marriage is abolished
- A law is passed to give equal share in ancestral property
- Widow marriage is encouraged
- Dowry system is banned legally
- Provide shelter to such of the women who are in trouble, arrangements are made for their temporary shelter (since 1969)
- In all the walks of life, women are given equal opportunities together with men

## **Provisions for Children**

All those who are below the age of 14 are identified as children. Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru said that children are the wealth of the country and that a 'Child of today is the Citizen of tomorrow'. Although the Constitution guarantees certain rights to children, many children in our country are without proper care, nourishment and education. Some of the specific problems faced by children are:

- Child Abuse: When children are subjected to physical punishment and or mental torture, this is known as Child Abuse. Some examples are severely beating; being indifferent towards them; employing them in dangerous jobs and behaving badly with them.
- Exploitation of Girl Child: She is forced to do difficult and tedious domestic chores. For example, girls of a family are expected to carry water and / or firewood over long distances, while the boys of the family do not do such work. It is common for families that are having economic problems to send their daughters to work as domestic servants to houses of rich people as bonded labourers until their parents repay the loans.
- Problems of Child Labour: Children are employed not only in fields and in homes, but also in hotels, garages and in factories like match-box, crackers, textiles, etc.
- School Dropouts: Children are pulled out by their parents so that they can contribute in their fields or contribute to family's income. Dropping out of school is against interests of child. Currently, there are many schemes which try to retain children in school.

The General Assembly of United Nations Organization adopted a Universal Charter in November 1989 for the welfare of the children. The Rights of the Child under the Charter are as follows:

| • | Right to Life                                                      | • Right to Education                                       |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| • | Right to Health                                                    | • Right for obtaining Nutritious Food                      |
| • | Right to Leisure                                                   | • Right to Play                                            |
| • | Right to get Good Standard of Life                                 | • Right of Protection against<br>Exploitation & Negligence |
| • | Right for Protection from Abuse & Immoral Traffic<br>& Intoxicants | • Right against subjecting to Drugs                        |
| • | Right against Forced Employment                                    | • Right against Violence                                   |

Irrespective of caste, race, religion, language, sex, society, the rights are to be strictly adhered to by all the nations and for no reason these rights could be denied. Since 1974, the Government has undertaken various projects and programmes for the all round development of children which include the nutrition, inoculation, health checking, pre-school education, etc. The Government of India has opened 'Balavikas Kendras' under the aegis of the Indian Council for Child Welfare for the development of the children. In 1955, National Children's Board was established to promote the cause of the child welfare. Both Central and State Governments have taken various measures to protect the rights of the children and steps have been taken for the eradication of child labor.

#### **Provisions for Other Backward Classes**

Seats are reserved in the Legislatures for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The State is free to make special Provisions for the advancement of Socially and Educationally Backward Classes and for Women and Children.

Not intended with making Special provisions for the Scheduled Castes, who a specific category of socially depressed people (generally identifiable with the Gandhian term 'harijan'), the Constitution has made separate Provisions for the amelioration and advancement of all 'backward classes', in general. Of course, the Constitution does not define Other Backward Classes. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are no doubt backward classes, but the fact that the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are mentioned together with the expression 'backward classes' in the foregoing provisions shows that there may be Other Backward Classes of people besides the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The Constitution provides for the appointment of a 'Commission to investigate the conditions of backward classes (Article, 340). Such a Commission was appointed in 1953 (Kaka Saheb Kalelkar as Chairman), with the following terms of appointment:

- To determine the tests by which any particular class or group of people can be called 'backward'
- To determine a list of such backward communities for the whole of India
- To examine the difficulties of backward classes and to recommend steps to be taken for their amelioration

This Commission submitted its Report to the Government in 1955, the tests recommended by the Commission appeared to the Government to be too vague and to be of much practical value; hence, the State Governments have been authorized to give assistance to the backward classes according to the lists prepared by the State Governments themselves.

The Second Backward Classes Commissioner, B. P. Mandal, submitted his Report in 1980. In August, 1990, the Government declared reservation of 27% seats in government service on the basis of this report. This was challenged as unconstitutional. A nine-Judge Bench has decided this case in November, 1992, rejecting that challenge. The Court has not itself enumerated the 'backward classes' but has directed the Government to set up a Commission to specify the backward classes, in the light of the principles laid down by the Court. Following the recommendations of the commission, the Central Government has reserved 27% seats in all recruitments to be made from 9th September, 1993.

Minority: It is Minority:Minority: recognized not only on the basis of religion, but also on the basis of language, script or culture. That means, it can be a Religious Minority (i.e. a minority based on religion) or Linguistic Minority (i.e. a minority based on language). It may not be out of place here to state that Article 30 has been criticized on the ground that the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice given to minority communities is denied to majority community. Again, since the term 'minority' has not been defined anywhere in the Constitution, and there are advantages in belonging to a minority community, groups within the majority Hindu community, such as the Arya Samaj in Punjab and Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal have started claiming minority status.

Religious Minorities: Except Hinduism which has about 80% population in India, all other religions are considered as minorities, since they together make balance 20%. The minority religions are Islamic, Christianity, Jains, Buddhists, Parsees, Sikhs and Jews. Constitution of India provides following rights to the religious minorities:

- Right to establish educational institutions of their choice. They can maintain their own language and script for imparting education. The government facilities and funds as applicable to other institutes will be provided.
- There will be no discriminations in granting educational aid to minority institutions. There will also be no conditions for such grants.
- Constitution guarantees religious freedom. They can have their own prayer halls and prayer timings.
- No person can be discriminated against in the matter of public employment, on the ground of race, religion, or caste.

Our Constitution does not provide any reservation for religious minorities in elected bodies. This is done to avoid division of the society on religious grounds. Constitution has progressive look to give upliftment to the socio-economic backwardness than the one to be considered on religion based.

Linguistic Minorities: This is more predominant due to formation of linguistic States since 1953. The formation of States on language based started with 'Telugu' speaking in 'Andhra' in 1953. Since then by 1956, many other States were formed based on languages like Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Marathi, Gujarati, etc. By and large, this was a good and

successful method since people got a common subject for their unity in a State. A minor disadvantage was the cause and concern for linguistic minorities in border villages, towns and cities.

For about 50 to 100 kilometers across each State borders, these will be lot of people speaking language of neighbouring State. Hence, it is felt necessary to help them to have freedom to learn in their own language and feel equal amongst the people of majority language. Some of the constitutional rights for linguistic minorities are as follows:

- Any section of the Indian citizens having a distinct language, script or culture of its own shall have the fundamental right to conserve the same. The State would not impose by law any other language or law belonging to the majority of the locality. This gives protection to both religious and linguistic minorities.
- The Constitution directs every State to provide adequate facilities for instruction in the mother tongue at the primary stage of education to children belonging to linguistic minority groups.
- A Special Officer for linguistic minorities shall be appointed by the President to investigate all matters relating to the safeguards provided for linguistic minorities under the Constitution (Article 350B).
- Parliament has enacted the National Commission for Minorities Act 1992 for monitoring the working of the safeguards provided in the Constitution and in Union and State laws.
- There shall be no discrimination against any citizen on the ground of religion, race, caste or language, in the matter of admission into educational institutions maintained or aided by the State.
- All minorities, based on religion or language, shall have the fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.
