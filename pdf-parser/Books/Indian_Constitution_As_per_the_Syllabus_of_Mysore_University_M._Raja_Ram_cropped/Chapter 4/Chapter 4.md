## **PROVISIONS FOR STATE GOVERNMENT**

**Enforcing Rights through Writs – Public Interest Litigation – Directive Principles of State Policy – The need to balance Fundamental Rights with Directive Principles – Constitution and Sustainable Development**

## **Writs**

The Article 32 (Clause 2) empowers the Supreme Court to issue directions, orders or writs which may be appropriate. The FIVE writs enumerated are Habeas Corpus, Mandamus, Prohibition, Certiorari and Quo warranto.

- 1. Habeas Corpus: (Writ requiring person to be brought before judges) It literally means 'have his body'. By this writ, the court can cause any person who has been detained or imprisoned to be physically brought before the court. The court than examines the reasons of his detention. If there is no legal justification, he is set free. The Supreme Court has laid down that production of the body of the prisoner before the court is not an essential feature of the writ. Disobedience of this writ is punishable as contempt of court. Hence, this kind of writ is very powerful.
- 2. Mandamus: (Supreme Court's writ conveying command to lower Courts) It literally means a command or order. It is a command directing a person, corporation, inferior court or government or any public authority to do the thing or perform the act specified in the writ. The thing or act must be in the nature of a public duty. This writ is a wakening call. It tells the sleeping authority which refuses to perform a public duty. It is a writ which demands activity. It sets the authority in motion.
- 3. Prohibition: (Order that forbids something) This is the reverse of Mandamus. In case of Mandamus, the Supreme Court orders the Lower courts to be active whereas in case of Prohibition, it restricts or ask to be inactive. In other words, the object of the writ is to compel lower courts to keep themselves within the limits of the

jurisdiction. It must be noted that prohibition lies only against judicial or quasijudicial functions (courts and tribunals). It does not lie against the legislative or executive functions. It cannot be issued against private persons or associations.

- 4. Certiorari: (Supreme Court issuing writ questioning decision of Lower court) It is used after the decision / action. The objective is to limit the role of a lower court to its jurisdiction. It can be issued only by a Superior Court. It is directed against the orders of an Inferior Court or Tribunal.
- 5. Quo warranto: (Writ regarding misuse of public offices) It is necessitated as some unlawful claimants seize by force (usurp) a public office. It literally is a question 'where is your warrant of appointment?' The Court by this writ examines the legality of the claim of a person to a public office or franchise. If he is not able to show his legal right, he may be ousted by the Court.

The various above discussed Writs distinguished from each other:

- Mandamus commands activity. Prohibition orders inactivity. Prohibition stops an authority in the middle of proceedings. It prevents usurpation of jurisdiction.
- Mandamus is generally addressed to administrative authorities. Certiorari and Prohibition generally control the courts and tribunals.
- Certiorari and Prohibition are instruments to control an inferior tribunal which has exceeded its jurisdiction or wrongly exercised its jurisdiction. Mandamus is issued against an inferior tribunal which has declined to exercise its jurisdiction.
- Mandamus may direct a tribunal to proceed according to law. Certiorari quashes the proceedings or removes the proceedings to itself on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or error apparent on the face of the record, etc.
- The grounds for issue of Certiorari and Prohibition are the same. Prohibition is issued at an earlier stage when the matter has not come to a close, to prevent the tribunal from going ahead. Certiorari lies where a tribunal after exercising jurisdiction where it had none or exceeding its jurisdiction where it had some, handed over a final decision.
- The object of Prohibition is prevention and Certiorari is prevention and cures both.
- Mandamus commands a person to perform a function which it is under a legal duty to perform. Quo warranto is an enquiry to ascertain whether a person holding an office has legal authority to do so. When he is not able to support his claim, he may be ordered to vacate.

#### **Indian Citizenship**

In order to link people to a government and to identify those who are members of a country, we have citizenship. There are FIVE methods of acquiring the citizenship of India as per the Citizenship Act of 1955. These are as follows:

1. Citizenship by Birth: Every person born in India on or after 26th January, 1950 shall be a citizen of India by birth. Those born before 1950, in the country are also entitled to Indian Citizenship.

- 2. Citizenship by Descent: A person born outside India on or after 26th January, 1950, shall be a citizen of India by descent, if the father is a citizen of India at the time of the person's birth.
- 3. Citizenship by Registration: A provision is made under law that several classes of persons can acquire Indian Citizenship by registering themselves before the President of India. For example, persons of Indian origin who have been residents in India for five years or persons who have married an Indian citizen can apply for Citizenship.
- 4. Citizenship by Naturalization: A foreigner can acquire Indian Citizenship as per the Indian law. The Citizenship so acquired is known as Citizenship by Naturalization.
- 5. Citizenship by Incorporation of Territory: If any new territory becomes a part of India, the people residing in that territory will acquire Indian Citizenship. For instance, in 1961 the rule of the Portuguese in Goa was overthrown. As a result, Goa became a part of India, and the residents of Goa became Indian citizens.

Loss of Indian Citizenship: Loss of Indian Citizenship: The Citizenship Act of 1955 specifies THREE occasions when Indian Citizenship is lost, namely,

- 1. By Renunciation: An Indian can voluntarily renounce the Citizenship of India.
- 2. By Termination: When a citizen of India willingly acquires the Citizenship of another country, the person loses his Indian Citizenship.
- 3. By Deprivation: On certain occasions, a person can be deprived of his / her Citizenship by an order of the Government of India. For example, if the Indian Citizenship has been acquired by a person by fraud or the person has shown himself / herself to be disloyal towards the Constitution of India, that citizen can be deprived of Indian Citizenship.

Rights of a Citizen: Rights of Anyone who is the citizen of India has certain rights. Such rights include:

- Right to Vote: that is after the age of eighteen every individual, irrespective of his / her social background and economic status, has the right to vote in all elections (till 1988, it was 21 years – Article 326).

#### **Public Interest Litigation**

Sometimes, a Government or a Public Body violates the law, or indulges in suppressing or exploiting the citizens. Any citizen affected by such violations may directly complain to the Court. Such a letter of complaint is taken up as Public Interest Litigation by the Court. Without charging any Court fees, the Court inquires into the complaint. A writ petition under Public Interest Litigation can be filed by any public spirited individual or a social action group for the enforcement of the constitutional or legal rights of some other person or group of persons disadvantageously placed.

A writ petition under Public Interest Litigation is entertained by a High Court under Article 226 of the Indian Constitution or in the case of breach of any fundamental right by the Supreme Court under the Article 32 of the Indian Constitution. For filing a case under Public Interest Litigation, it is not necessary to file a regular writ petition where a case is filed through a lawyer. A case can be referred to a judge by just writing a letter. Sometimes, judges themselves have taken initiative in the cases, depending upon the reports in the newspapers or television.

The field of Public Interest Litigation is quite vast. It is extended to almost every walk of human life. It covers environment, prisons, police, social circumstances, municipal administration, human rights, legal aid, speedy trial, preventive detention, phone tapping, elections, etc.

The following are the possible areas where a Public Interest Litigation can be filed:

- Where a factory / industrial unit is causing air pollution and people nearly are getting affected.
- Where, in an area / street, there are no street lights causing inconvenience to the commuters.
- Where some 'Banquet Hall' plays a loud music, in nights causes noise pollution.
- Where poor people are affected because of the State Government's decisions to impose heavy taxes.
- For abolishing child labour, and bonded labour.
- Where rights of working women are affected by sexual harassment.
- For maintaining roads, sewages, etc in good conditions.
- For removal of big hoarding and signboards from the busy roads to avoid traffic problems.

#### **In the following cases, Public Interest Litigation is not permitted**

- It is not meant for enforcement of individual specific rights. The Supreme Court has made it clear that a person filing Public Interest Litigation must not do it for personal gain or for private profit.
- It should not be moved with political motive. A case under this must be for general social good and not for political groups or motives.

#### **Directive Principles of State Policy**

Our Constitution aims at the establishment of a Welfare State. To achieve this aim, the Constitution has framed certain principles and policies. It has also given certain directions to the state to serve as guidelines. Such guiding principles are known as Directive Principle of State Policy. Directive Principles of State Policies are also called as the 'Instrument of Instructions'. These principles are for the good governance of the country. These principles cannot be enforced in the courts.

The Directive Principles of State Policy is given under Part IV of the Constitution. This Part contains Articles from 36 to 51. These Articles deals with almost all the necessary duties and functions to be done by the state.

These rights are not Fundamental Rights and are not enforceable. The Directive Principles helps the State to implement some of the goals and ideals of the Constitution. The ideals, directions and rights of the citizens included under the Directive Principles of State Policy may be summarized as follows:

- Social Justice: Assuring social, economic and political justice to the citizens for the purpose of promoting their welfare.

- Protection and Maintenance of places of Historic interest: Historical monuments are part of our heritage and the state must protect and maintain them.
- Promotion of International Peace and Amity: The State must develop good relations with all neighbouring States (Countries).

### **Principles**

The Directive Principles are the basic principles of a new social and economic order or of a welfare State. These may be grouped under three categories i.e. Socialistic Principles, Gandhian Principles and Liberal Principles.

## Socialistic Principles

- To secure and protect a social order which stands for the welfare of the people (Article 38).
- The State shall direct its policy towards securing: adequate means of livelihood to all citizens, a proper distribution of the material resources of the community for the common good, the prevention of concentration of wealth to the common detriment, equal pay for equal work for both men and women, the protection of the strength and health of workers and avoiding circumstances which force citizens to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength, protection of childhood and youth against exploitation of moral and material abandonment (Article 39).
- The State shall secure equal justice and free legal aid to the poor (Article 39A).
- All people should get employment, education and public assistance in the case of unemployment (Article 41).
- To secure just human conditions of work and maternity relief (Article 42).
- Weaker sections of the society are given a proper care (Article 46).

#### Gandhian Principles

- State shall organize village panchayats as units of self-government (Article 40).
- To secure work, a living wage, a decent standard of life, leisure and social and cultural opportunities for people and in particular to promote cottage industries (Article 43).

- To promote with special care, the educational and economic interest of the weaker sections of the people, especially the scheduled castes and tribes (Article 46).
- To secure the improvement of the public health and the prohibition of intoxicating drinks and drugs (Article 47).
- To organize agriculture and animal husbandry on scientific lines and preserve and improve the breeds and prohibit the slaughter of cows, calves and draught cattle (Article 48).

#### Liberal Principles

- To secure a uniform civil code applicable to the entire country (Article 44).
- To provide within ten years from the commencement of the Constitution, free and compulsory education to all children up to the age of 14 years (Article 45).
- To protect all monuments of historical interest and national importance (Article 49).
- To bring about the separation of the judiciary from the executive (Article 50).
- To endeavour to secure, the promotion of international peace and security, the maintenance of just and honorable relations between nations, the settlement of international disputes by arbitration (Article 51).

#### **Difference between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles**

Though the objective of both Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles are identical, there are significant differences between the two:

- Fundamental Rights are mostly political rights which tend to restrain the State. They are also called as negative rights. Articles 14 and 21 are negatively worded. Directive Principles are social rights in the form of positive obligations of the State and pertain to the economic field.
- The scope of the Fundamental Rights is limited but the Directive Principles cover a vast area.
- Fundamental Rights are justiciable. Courts protect them and compel the State to respect them. But Courts cannot direct the State to give effect to a Directive Principle. They are enforceable rights.
- Fundamental Rights are legally enforceable because they are guaranteed rights.

## **Comparison of Fundamental Duties with Directive Principles**

Fundamental Duties are comparable to the Directive Principles. The Fundamental Duties are addressed to the citizens. The country expects them to perform certain Fundamental Duties as citizens. They are not spectators but active participants in attainment of national goals. The Directive Principles are goals setup by the Constitution for all governments. It is the duty of the state to apply these Directive Principles in making laws (as per Article 37). But in case a State does not implement a Directive Principle, it cannot be penalized. There is no legal sanction. The only sanction is public opinion. Similarly, the Fundamental Duties have no sanction attached. The citizen must introspect and endeavour to perform these duties. The sanction should be self imposed. They can not be enforced by the court.

#### **India's Commitment to International Peace and International Law**

International Law is nothing but Law of Nations. International Law composes of rules of conduct which States have volunteered to respect between themselves in relation to each other. These are certain rules of law governing States, their relationship with each other and their relationship with international institutions.

#### Principles of International Law

- Each State shall maintain Peace and Security
- Promotion of International Cooperation
- Promotion and Protection of Human Rights

No act of sovereignty can be performed in another State. It is the duty of India that it should not breach the international peace. Each State in its day today working is bound to respect International Law and Treaties. No State is allowed to threaten the territorial integrity and sovereignty of another sovereign State. It is the duty of every State to respect the treaties and do the necessary things with respect to these treaties.

In India, there is provision in the Constitution under Part IV, Directive Principles of State Policy for maintaining international peace and security. Article 51 provides for the promotion of international peace and security – The State shall endeavour to:

- Promote international peace and security,
- Maintain just and honourable relations between nations,
- Foster respect for international law and treaty obligations in the dealings of organized people with one another, and
- Encourage settlement of international disputes by arbitration.

#### **Our National Symbols**

- National Flag: It has three colours-deep saffron (kesari) at the top, white in the middle and dark green at the bottom. In the center of the white band is a navy blue chakra (wheel). The chakra has 24 spokes. It is rectangular in shape (Length : Breadth = 3 : 2). It should be either cotton or silk. The thread should prepared manually and the cloth hand-made. The saffron stands for sacrifice; white for truth, peace and purity; and green for the evergreen earth as well as agricultural & industrial prosperity. The design of chakra is taken from the capital of the Ashokan Pillar at Sarnath. This is called Dharma Chakra i.e., Wheel of Law. It symbolizes constant movement.
- National Anthem: The song Jana-gana-mana was composed by Rabindranath Tagore in 1911 in the Bengali language. The playing time of full and short versions is approximately 52 and 20 seconds respectively.
- National Calendar: Also called as Rashtriya Panchanga, prepared by Meghnad Saha.
- National Animal: Tiger
- National Bird: Peacock
- National Flower: Lotus
- National Tree: Banyan
- National Fruit: Mango

There are some rules and regulations upon how to fly the flag, based on the 26th January, 2002 legislation. These include the following:

#### The Do's

- The National Flag may be hoisted in educational institutions (schools, colleges, sports camps, scout camps, etc.) to inspire respect for the Flag. An oath of allegiance has been included in the Flag hoisting in schools.
- A member of public, a private organization or an educational institution may hoist / display the National Flag on all days and occasions, ceremonial or otherwise consistent with the dignity and honour of the National Flag.
- Section 2 of the new code accepts the right of all private citizens to fly the Flag on their premises.

#### The Don'ts

- The Flag cannot be used for communal gains, drapery, or clothes. As far as possible, it should be flown from sunrise to sunset, irrespective of the weather.
- The Flag cannot be intentionally allowed to touch the ground or the floor or the trail in water.
- It cannot be draped over the hood, top, and sides or back of vehicles, trains, boats or aircraft.
- No other Flag or bunting can be placed higher than the Flag. Also, no object, including flowers or garlands or emblems can be placed on or above the Flag. The tricolour cannot be used as a festoon, rosette or bunting.

NOTE: The Parliament of India has adopted on 12th December, 2005, anew law to protect the National Flag and ban its uses deemed insulting. The use of National Flag on underwear or on any other clothing worn below the belt shall be forbidden. However, sports figures and others can wear India's orange, white, and green national colours on their T-shirts, caps and coats. The legislation makes it illegal to embroider national symbols on pillow cases and handkerchiefs. Also, use of National Flags made of plastic affects the dignity of the Flag as they are not biodegradable like the paper Flags and they cannot be destroyed for a long time. It is also harmful for the atmosphere. Having noticed large scale use of National Flags made of plastic, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs has asked all States and Union Governments to use only Flags made of paper on important national, cultural and sports events.

One of the spurious meanings of the Indian Flag states that the colour of saffron / kesari stand for Hindus, courage, sacrifice, patriotism (balidaan); white is for peace between Hindus and Muslims, purity, truth, simplicity and peace; and green is for Muslims, growth, auspiciousness, agriculture, farming and greenery; the navy blue wheel in the center is the Ashoka Chakra, the wheel of progress. In the center of the white band, there is a wheel in navy blue to indicate the Dharma Chakra, the wheel of law in the Sarnath Lion Capital. This Chakra is a symbol dating back to 2nd Century BC. Its diameter approximates the width of the white band and it has 24 spokes, which intends to show that there is life in movement and death in stagnation.

The Constituent Assembly which drew up the Constitution of India, adopted, on 22nd July, 1947, the tricolour as Independent India's National Flag. After a debate, the Dharma Chakra (of Emperor Ashoka) was included in the central white stripe of the Flag, instead of the Chakra (used symbolically by Gandhiji and also included in the Flag used by the Indian National Congress). The same Chakra adorns the State Emblem adapted form the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka in addition to the motto from the Mundaka Upanishad, Satyameva Jayate, which means Truth alone Triumphs. The Chakra or wheel symbolizes the Power of the State governed by Dharma, which is the primordial Indian system of justice which is the bed-rock, not only of governance but of the socio-politico-economic edifice itself.

#### **Emergency Provisions**

Emergency Provisions of our Constitution enable the federal government to acquire the strength of a unitary system whenever the exigencies of the situation so demand. The Constitution provides for three different types of abnormal situations which call for departure from the normal governmental machinery: (Refer 44th Amendment Act, 1978)

- 1. National Emergency:Article 352 empowers the President to make a 'Proclamation of Emergency' if he / she is satisfied that the security of India or of any part of the territory of India is threatened by – war, external aggression, or armed rebellion.
  - First Proclamation–26th October, 1962 when Chinese aggression and revoked on 10th January, 1968
  - Second Proclamation–3rd December, 1971 was made on the ground of undeclared war by Pakistan
  - Third Proclamation–25th June, 1975 was made on the ground of internal disturbance given by Smt. Indira Gandhi

NOTE: The 2nd & 3rd Proclamations were revoked on 21st March, 1977

- 2. State Emergency: State Emergency: It is a situation arising out of failure of Constitutional Machinery in a State (Article 356). Constitution does not employ the word emergency for this situation.
- 3. Financial Emergency: Financial Emergency: It is a Financial Emergency:situation in which the financial stability of India is threatened (Article 360).

#### **Effects of Proclamation of Emergency**

It has wide range ranging effects on the polity. It brings about a change in the distribution of powers between the Union and the States. Powers of the Union increase considerably. The Fundamental Rights suffer an eclipse and the executive acquires unprecedented powers.

The effects of a Proclamation of Emergency may be discussed under five heads. Its effect on the following:

Extension of Executive Power: While the Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the Executive Power of the State extends to giving of directions to any State as to the manner in which the Executive Power of the State is to be exercised. If the Proclamation is confined to a specified area the power to give directions shall not be limited to the States in that area. Directions may be given to the other States. Thus the State Governments are brought under the control of the Center.

- Extension of Legislative Power: While a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the Parliament gains the power to make laws with respect to many matters in the State List. The limitations imposed by State List are removed. The State continues to possess Legislative Powers but the powers become subject to the overriding powers of the Parliament. Parliament may act immediately in the interest of the Nation without waiting for a State to take necessary steps. In a way the Constitution becomes Unitary.
- Effect on Distribution of Finances: While a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the President is vested with the power to alter and modify the Provisions of the Constitution relating to the distribution of the revenues between the Union and the States. Such modification shall continue till the end of the financial year in which the proclamation ceases to operate. The changes are effected by the President by issuing an order. Every order is to be laid before each House of Parliament.
- Effect on the Fundamental Rights: Articles 358 and 359 describe the effect of the Proclamation of Emergency on the Fundamental Rights. Article 358 removes all fetters put on the State by Article 19. The State may make a law abridging any of the freedoms conferred by Article 19.
- Miscellaneous Effects: While Proclamation of Emergency is in operation, the Parliament may by law extend the duration of Lok Sabha for a period not exceeding one year at a time. But the period shall not exceed beyond six months after the proclamation has ceased to operate. During the Emergency imposed by Smt. Indira Gandhi, the life of the Lok Sabha was extended by one year (Amendment Act 109 of 1976).

#### **Effects of National Emergency**

At the time of national emergency, the country almost loses its federal structure and becomes unitary in form as the Parliament vests maximum powers with it.

- Parliament can make laws for the whole of the country or any part of the country which has been kept under emergency with respect to any matter in the State List.
- If a law passed by the Parliament is in conflict with the state law, then the central law prevails.
- The President is entitled to issue an ordinance regarding a state subject even if the Parliament is not in session.
- The Parliament is authorized to make the laws, delegate powers and impose duties on Government of India and its Officers, as to carry out the laws made by it.
- The union Government can issue directions or give instructions to any state government in exercising its executive powers.
- Changes can be made in the allotment and distribution of revenues between the union and the State by the President.

The Fundamental Rights can be suspended and their enforcement by the Supreme Court and other Courts of Law stand suspended. Thus making the people restrict the enjoyment of the Fundamental Rights.

## **Effects of State Emergency**

- The President is empowered with all the functions of the State Government or he may confer the authority and powers to the Governor of the State and Administrator in the case of Union Territories to conduct the administration.
- The Parliament has authority to make the law on the items in the State List.
- Parliament is also empowered to authorize the President to issue an order to sanction expenditure from the Consolidated Fund of the State, subject to the approval of the Parliament later.
- The President delegates special powers to the Union or State servants for the smooth running of the administration of the State.
- The powers and jurisdiction of the High Court does not come under Article 356.

(NOTE: The President's Rule has been imposed more than 108 times under this Article 356 were imposed on the following conditions to dismiss unwanted State Governments:

- On the ground of political instability.
- Breakdown of the law and order.
- Due to corruption and maladministration.
- To control and stop opposition and unwanted parties from forming governments both before and after elections.
- While creating new States.

## **Effects of Financial Emergency**

- During the financial emergency, "the executive authority of the Union shall extend to the giving of directions to any state to observe such canons of financial property as may be specified in the direction" which the President may think necessary for the purpose.
- The President may direct to make necessary cut or reduction in the salaries and allowances of all government servants which include the salaries of Judges of Supreme Court and High Courts.
- The President can veto the Money Bills of the States which means the Money Bill or Financial Bills passed by the State Legislatures are reserved for the consideration of the President.

(NOTE: However, the Financial Emergency has not been proclaimed so far, by the President)
