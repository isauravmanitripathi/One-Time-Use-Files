Parliament is a circular building with the Central Hall at the center. The three chambers for Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and the Library Hall radiate from the center. These chambers and the garden courts between them are in turn surrounded by a circular four-storeyed structure with rooms for Ministers, Parliamentary Committees, Party offices, Press, etc. The Central Hall has witnessed historic moments. It is here that the Indian Constitution was framed between 9th December, 1946 and 24th January, 1950, when it served as the Constituent Assembly Hall. It was here again the power of reign was transferred on 15th August, 1947. Presidential address at the first Lok Sabha session after election, first session of the Budget session, joint sitting of both Houses and address by visiting Heads of States are held here.

#### Special Annexure 287

The Lok Sabha Chamber is U-shaped with a seating capacity of 550 Members of Parliament. The Ruling party sits on the Speaker's right and the Opposition on his left side. Just below the Speaker's chair is the table of the Secretary General of the Lok Sabha. In front of him is a large table where the official reporters (work in five minute relay takes down verbatim the entire proceedings of the House) and other officials sit. This is the 'Table of the House' where documents, etc. are placed. The adjacent vacant place surrounding it is the 'Well' of the House. On the first floor are special galleries for the press, public, guests of the Speaker, Rajya Sabha members, diplomatic and distinguished visitors. A special place is reserved for the family and the guests of the President, Governors, visiting Heads of State and other visiting dignitaries, on the left side of the Speaker.

Rajya Sabha: The Council of States (Rajya Sabha) shall consist of not more than 238 elected representatives of States and Union Territories and 12 members to be nominated by the President (Article 80). The Council of States shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-third of its members shall retire, as soon as may be, after the expiry of 2 years. Elections to Rajya Sabha are indirect. Although the Constitution provides for 250 members, it has now only 245 seats and of these, 233 are represented by the States and Union Territories.

In a Parliamentary system like that of India, the Executive is subordinate to the Legislature. The Judiciary alone functions as an independent branch. (But in a Presidential system of government like that of the United States of America, the three branches of government– Legislature, Executive and Judiciary–are independent units).
