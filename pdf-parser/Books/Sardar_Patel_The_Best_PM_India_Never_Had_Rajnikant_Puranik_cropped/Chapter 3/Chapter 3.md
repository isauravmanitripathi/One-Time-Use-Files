# Freedom Struggle & Sardar, 1917–43

#### Start of Patel's Association with Gandhi, 1917

Initially, Patel did not have much interest in Gandhian politics. He was reported to have joked to Mavlankar: "He [Gandhi] will *ask you if you know how to sift pebbles from wheat. And that is supposed to bring independence* ."{RG2/L-637}

Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar (1888–1956) aka *Dadasaheb* was a Maharashtrian from Ratnagiri who had studied law at Ahmedabad, and had settled there. That's how he came into contact with Patel. Mavalankar was the President of the Central Legislative Assembly from 1946 to 1947, then Speaker of the Constituent Assembly of India, and subsequently the first Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

When Gandhi set up his Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad, many were attracted to it—some out of curiosity, and others out of genuine respect. Patel, who was practising in Ahmedabad, remained unimpressed for over a year, and took no interest in Gandhi or Gandhism. Still a chain-smoking, bridge-playing barrister in suit and tie and hat, he remained dismissive of Gandhi.{BK2/11}{BK/47}

There is an interesting episode about the arrival of Gandhi at the Ahmedabad club, where Sardar Patel was playing bridge. While almost all members rushed to meet Gandhi, Patel remained seated. *When asked, Patel derisively commented he did not look forward to lessons in cleaning toilets; and that bridge needed intellect, and was a much better pursuit!* {URL5}

However, Gandhi's acts during 1916-17 attracted Patel's attention: Champaran Satyagraha, Gandhi's representation to the Viceroy on the abolition of indentured labour, and its acceptance; removal of custom's barrier at Viramgam at Gandhi's instance; and to top them all the Champaran episode, where Gandhi had given a firm and dignified rebuff to the Raj. Impressed by them, Patel accepted Gandhi as his

Guru; although he was never blindly supportive of Gandhi. Gandhi's agrarian thrust through Champaran particularly impressed Patel, for he was a farmer's son.

Patel entered politics towards the end of 1917 when he attended the Gujarat Sabha's Provincial Political Conference at Godhra presided by Gandhi, and attended, among others, by Tilak and Jinnah. Patel attended the Conference as an ordinary delegate donning a dhoti, instead of the usual European clothes. Patel was appointed as a secretary in the Conference along with Indulal Yagnik, while Gandhi was appointed as the President.

#### Sardar's Public Service Landmarks, 1917-19

Patel got elected as the Sanitation Commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. That resulted in his frequent clashes with British officials on civic issues. In support of Gandhi's petition demanding Swaraj, Patel called upon all Indians to sign it in his speech in Borsad in September 1917, and vigorously campaigned for it. Patel met Gandhi personally in October 1917. Gandhi egged him on to become secretary of the Gujarat Sabha, which later became the Gujarati arm of the Indian National Congress.

#### Fight against Veth

In his new capacity in Gujarat Sabha, Patel vigorously fought against veth (*begar* : getting services without payment) in 1917. Though not immediately, he ultimately succeeded in getting it abolished. Veth was the forced servitude of Indians to Europeans: It was customary for an official visiting a village to command the services of carpenters, barbers, bullock-cart-wallas, kulis, sweepers and potters for various odd jobs without payment, and make them wait on the officials.

Fight against Plague

Plague broke out in Ahmedabad at the end of 1917, leading to closure of schools and courts. Many left the city. But, Vallabhbhai, ignoring his personal safety, refused to move out of his residence at Bhadra in Ahmedabad. He moved around in streets, getting the sewers

cleaned. He mounted massive relief efforts.

Patel's Kheda Agitation 1918

The peasants of Kheda had been agitating for exemption from taxation in the wake of plague and famine, but their plea had been turned down by the British authorities. Gandhiji was supportive of their demand, but was busy elsewhere. Gandhiji was delighted when Patel readily volunteered for the assignment. It was a full time job, and it meant abandonment of his law-practice which he had built up with considerable efforts, the obvious consequence of which was to give up all material ambitions. Patel took a conscious, considered decision, and jumped into the peasant struggle, sacrificing everything.

Patel toured Kheda villages in 1918, mobilising villagers for statewide refusal for payment of taxes—emphasising potential hardships, need for complete unity and non-violence despite any provocation while also documenting their grievances. He was helped in the effort by Narhari Parikh, Mohanlal Pandya, Ravi Shankar Vyas and Abbas Tyabji.

The revolt invited government wrath. Upon refusal of tax, the government's collectors and inspectors sent in thugs to seize property and cattle, while the police forfeited the lands and other agrarian property. The revolt was astounding: even when all their personal property, land and livestock were seized, Kheda's farmers remained firmly united. Those who sought to buy the confiscated property were ostracized. The mobilisation was so effective, and the agitation was so successful that the government was ultimately forced to negotiate with Patel. Revenue was suspended for that year and the next, the revenuerate was scaled back, and the seized property was returned.

The agitation brought Patel into the national limelight, and made him a hero to Gujaratis.

Patel was elected president of the newly formed Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee in 1920. He served as its president till 1945.

#### Sardar's Comments on Jallianwala Bagh, 1919

Sardar Patel had commented thus on the Jallianwala Bagh tragedy : "When the war was over we were given the Rowlatt Act which deprived

us of freedom of action. When the people protested against such a tyrannical piece of legislation, the Government decided on a policy of suppressing all resistance by force… And finally the Government appointed a committee ostensibly to investigate the happenings in Jallianwala Bagh and Lahore but actually, as it has turned out, to hush up everything. In the House of Lords, the lords verily showed their nobility! The murder of so many innocent men and women was to them nothing as compared with the honour of one callous Englishman [Brigadier General Reginald Dyer]. That officer they regarded as brave, and those innocent persons who were killed as rebels!"{RG2/L-1468}

#### Khilafat & Non-Cooperation Movement (KNCM) 1920-22

Ottoman emperor was also a Caliph (Khalifa), and being so, he was nominally the supreme religious and political leader of all Muslims across the world. With the defeat of the Ottomans in the World War I, an outcry on behalf of the caliphate (Khilafat) emerged across the Muslim world, including in India, where it was relatively more prominent, thanks to the activism of people like Maulana Muhammad Ali, his brother, Maulana Shaukat Ali, and many others, including Dr Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, Hasrat Mohani, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Dr Hakim Ajmal Khan, who formed the All India Khilafat Committee.

Gandhi supported the movement and worked out an alliance of the Congress with the Khilafat leaders in 1920. Together they launched a nationwide non-cooperation movement, and a campaign of mass, peaceful civil disobedience. However, Jinnah had advised against supporting fundamentalist elements, and the Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha had opposed the Khilafat Movement.

The Apostle of Non-violence had apparently ignored the fact that the Khalifa and the Ottoman Empire had perpetrated the dastardly Armenian Genocide, also known as the *Armenian Holocaust* , during 1915-17 involving the *systematic extermination of about 15 lakhs* (1.5 million) of its minority Armenian subjects inside their historic homeland, which lies within the present-day Republic of Turkey.

In a special Congress session in Calcutta on 4 September 1920, the Congress, at the instance of Gandhi, adopted non-cooperation for the sake of Khilafat and other matters, even though the then Congress

stalwarts like Chittaranjan Das, Motilal Nehru, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai were initially cool towards the proposal. However, Annie Besant, Madan Mohan Malaviya and Jinnah refused to endorse Gandhi on the proposal.

The session saw the emergence of young leaders like C Rajagopalachari, Vallabhbhai Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Abul Kalam Azad, and Jawaharlal Nehru. In the session, Gandhi promised Swaraj within 12 months of the launch of the non-cooperation movement!

KNCM showed no signs of abating, and by the end of 1921 over 30,000 were in British jails, including all the top Congress leaders. To dissuade people, flogging in the jails became a common practice. However, people wanted to further intensify the agitation. The AICC passed a resolution on 4 November 1921 to start additionally a civil disobedience campaign throughout India. However, Gandhi wanted to play it small, and snubbed those who wanted a more wide-spread action, with his trade-mark non-violence condition.

Gandhi suddenly suspended the non-cooperation movement on 12 February 1922, without consulting any of the stakeholders, including the Muslim leaders of the Khilafat Movement. The reason, or the excuse, was the perishing of 23 policemen when the *Chauri Chaura* Police Station in the Gorakhpur district of UP was set on fire in a retaliatory violence on 4 February 1922. Police had arrested leaders of a group picketing a liquor shop in the market place. In protest, a crowd gathered in front of the police station shouting slogans. The police opened fire into the crowd killing three and wounding several. Angered by the unprovoked firing, the protestors set fire to the police station, killing the policeman as a result.

At the time Gandhi was over 800 miles away in Bardoli in Gujarat. So, linking his agitation to the incident was far-fetched. Further, in a big country like India where the British freely resorted to unjust acts, exploitation, violence, firing, and humiliation of the natives, such incidents were bound to occur. Yet, Gandhi declared that his followers had sinned against God; and to continue the campaign would be to follow Satan. Satanic acts of the British didn't matter. But, stray violence, and that too only retaliatory violence, of some groups—that was bound to occur in a country as big as India—did seem to matter for Gandhi.

Even if one grants Gandhi his indefensible logic of calling off the

agitation on account of the violence, the question is why didn't he do so earlier in the face of far more ghastly violence? Reference is to the terrible *Moplah Anti-Hindu Attacks* of August-September 1921 in the Malabar region of Kerala. Chauri Chaura violence of February 1922 was not even 1% of *Moplah Anti-Hindu Attacks* earlier of August-September 1921, while both were in the context of the "Khilafat and Non-Cooperation Movement".

Gandhi's decision of withdrawal shocked, stunned and humiliated over 30,000 who were in Raj's prisons thanks to Gandhi. Many sent him angry letters. *Many like Rajaji saw a near victory turning into a dark defeat* . CR Das, then lodged in Alipore jail, felt distraught at Gandhi's "repeated bungling"{Gill/47} . Mahadev Desai, Gandhi's secretary then lodged in Agra jail, stated that the news had "absolutely unhinged"{SLM/165} him.

# Sardar's Stand on Gandhi's Withdrawal of KNCM

Sardar Patel was sceptical about Gandhi's Khilafat move. He considered it absurd Indians fighting for those in faraway land when they needed to first free themselves from the British slavery; although the opportunity it provided for a joint Hindu-Muslim struggle to wrest power from the British did appeal to him, and to many other Hindu leaders. Left to himself, Patel was a highly rational person, but blindly associated with Gandhi, he followed the same Gandhian path. Sardar was unhappy and disagreed with Gandhi's decision of suspension of the movement on account of the Chauri Chaura incident, though he didn't voice an open disagreement.

## Atatürk & Gandhi's Indefensible Stand

The Khilafat Movement lost its raison d'être when the forces of the young, dynamic, revolutionary military officer Mustafa *Kemal Atatürk* (1881-1938: the surname, Atatürk, meaning "Father of the Turks", was granted to him in 1934 and forbidden to any other person by the Turkish parliament), leader of the Turkish National Movement in the Turkish War of Independence, overthrew the Ottoman rule, abolished the role of Caliph, and established a modern, secular republic in independent Turkey in 1924.

#### Miserable Failure of Gandhi's First Mass Agitation

First, let us see what were the aims of Gandhi-led first mass agitation of Khilafat and non-cooperation: (1)Protection of Khalifa and Khilafat—Caliph of Turkey. (2)Swaraj (Self-rule) within 12 months. (3)Hindu-Muslim amity and unity, so that apart from other positives, anti-British forces become stronger.

Were any of the above aims met? NO.

Khalifa was kicked out and Khilafat terminated forever, not by the British, but by the Muslims of Turkey themselves, ushering-in a democratic and modern system of government under Kemal Mustafa. Swaraj remained a mirage, and was as far away as it had ever been.

Hindu-Muslim relationships, instead of improving, became worse. Many Muslim leaders who were with Gandhi in the *Khilafat Movement* turned anti, and joined Muslim League. In a way, the movement laid the foundation of future Pakistan. The sidelined Jinnah became rabidly anti-Gandhi, anti-Congress, and anti-Hindu. No dent whatsoever was caused to the British against whom the agitation was launched. Premature termination of the movement by Gandhi on the incident of Chauri Chaura led not to less, but more, violence, and communal riots.

# Patel & Nagpur Satyagraha 1923

The first anniversary of Lokmanya Tilak's death was inaugurated with bonfires of foreign cloth on 1 August 1921. Vallabhbhai also consigned his barrister's wardrobe and other western wear comprising trousers, shirts, ties, suits, collars, gowns to flame; and switched to khadi.

Maniben took the responsibility of spinning yarn for most of the dhotis and kurtas of her father. She continued doing so right till Sardar's death.

# Jabalpur National Flag Hoisting

In March 1923, the Jabalpur municipality passed a resolution to hoist the national flag over the Town Hall. The District Magistrate prohibited the same. When the flag was nevertheless hoisted, the police not only took it off, but trampled upon the national flag. In response, the District Congress Committee launched a satyagraha. Defying the prohibitory orders, a procession carrying the national flag

aloft was carried out led by, among others, Pandit Sunderlal and Subhadra Kumari Chauhan, the renowned poetess of the popular song on "Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi".

## Nagpur Satyagraha

Nagpur Agitation of April 1923 was inspired by the above happening in Jabalpur. On 13 April 1923, the anniversary of the Jallianwala Bagh Tragedy, the Central Provinces (C.P.) Government prohibited a peaceful procession with the national flag from entering Civil Lines in Nagpur, its capital. When the participants attempted to go forward with the flag into Civil Lines, the police beat them up and even flung many into open drains.

Charles Clarke, Commissioner of Nagpur, who lived in Civil Lines, had decided the flag would not be carried past his house, and decided to teach "law-breakers" a lesson, even threatening to shoot those who dared to march past his house with the national flag.

The Nagpur District Congress Committee, led by Jamnalal Bajaj, decided to violate the restrictions; and beginning 1 May 1923, volunteers walked with the flag towards Civil Lines each working day. They were arrested. Each day a fresh group of volunteers courted arrest.

## Sardar Patel's Winning Role

The struggle appealed to Sardar Patel, and from June 1923 onwards he began sending batches of volunteers from Gujarat to Nagpur. The volunteers began pouring in from other states too. Tamil and Karnataka groups also joined in.

The struggle and arrests went right through May, June and July, and into August. The volunteers were dumped into Nagpur jail, and when that overflowed, into Akola jail. Those arrested included teachers, lawyers, businessmen, zamindars, and people like Vinoba Bhave and Ravishankar Maharaj. While Vinoba Bhave was made to crush stones under the hot sun in jail; Ravishankar Maharaj had to grind kilos of grain on the chakki each day. Prisoners not fulfilling daily quotas were severely punished. Food contained dirt and pebbles, and was hardly eatable. Toilet and sanitary conditions were terrible. The conditions they were subjected to were so terrible that about ten percent of those arrested, unable to withstand the rigours, opted out by apologizing.

Jamnalal Bajaj was arrested at the end of June 1923, and was handed a stiff 18-month rigorous imprisonment. Stung, the CWC asked Sardar Patel to take charge of the struggle, which he did with effect from 10 July 1923. With Sardar at the helm, the struggle became much more organised and intense. Sardar's brother Vithalbhai also came over to help in the struggle.

Finally, the CP Governor Sir Frank Sly reached an agreement with the Patel brothers: Vithalbhai and Vallabhbhai. The national flag was allowed to be carried through the Civil Lines on 18 August 1923. The struggle was then called off, and all the prisoners were released.

#### Patel's Borsad Satyagraha 1923

In September 1923 the government announced a levy of Rs 2.4 lakhs on the residents of Borsad taluka as its expense on special antidacoity police posted there: each person over 16 years of age was to pay two rupees and seven annas towards the sum.{BK/89}

Sardar Patel and his colleagues uncovered evidence of the police being in cahoots with the dacoits; and that the villagers who had shown exemplary courage in resisting the dacoits or in informing the police were severely victimised.

Sardar Patel and his team organised the villagers for agitation against the levied tax. After a protracted struggle, which Sardar had organized superbly, the government was forced to give in. Patel had this to say in the meetings he addressed during the agitation:

"We are not beggars that we cannot afford to throw away two or three rupees. But the government wants to take that much money after calling us associates of dacoits. If the Government admits that its authority has vanished and its finances are poor, we shall be quite prepared to take over the administration.{BK/94}

"…The only reason assigned by the Government for punishing a whole people is that they do not provide information or evidence. Let us see how far this is true. Babar has to his credit 22 murders. Not one of the victims was a rich man. He did not murder them for the mere fun of it. They were informants. If after 22 such informants were murdered the Government seriously argues that the people do not give information, shall we ask how

many policemen were murdered?"{BK/92}

Gandhi was released from jail in a little less than two years of his six-year sentence; and he was full of praise for Sardar Patel's leadership during his [Gandhi's] incarceration. He noted "*Vallabhbhai's magnificent organizing and administrative* " skills, and his ability in having "*collected around himself a band of devoted workers of like mind and ability* "{BK/99} .

Gandhi also admired the Borsad effort for social change, terming it as more valuable.

# Patel's Commendable Work for Ahmedabad Municipality

Sardar Patel accepted an additional burden as the president of the Ahmedabad municipality from February 1924. Denied power at the national or provincial level, many Congress leaders chose civic leadership. Vallabhbhai's elder brother Vithalbhai, Jawaharlal Nehru, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Chitta Ranjan Das headed municipal bodies in Bombay, Allahabad, Patna, and Calcutta respectively. The Bose brothers had also headed the Calcutta municipality.

Sardar had proved early on that he was not a mere leader after posts and positions, but that he was a devoted man of action in the service of the people. He would visit wards each morning, and inspect work-sites, accompanied by concerned officials. Complainants could visit him personally in the afternoon. Impressed by his honesty, commitment and hard work, municipal staff gave out their best. All that made for solid achievements with the passage of time.

Before leaving active participation in the Ahmedabad municipality in 1927, Sardar had ensured that the drainage, that covered only onethird of Ahmedabad when he took over, covered the whole city; and over half the city had access to piped drinking water. He acquired 21 acres for the city along Sabarmati, which were later used for hospital and other utilities. He arranged for setting up of a third public health laboratory at Ahmedabad, after the only two at Pune and Karachi.

Sardar initiated removal of sexual disqualification in the district municipal act that barred women from contesting elections. He had the section removed in 1926 in Ahmedabad. Sardar also commissioned the first Gujarati typewriter in 1924 through a tie-up with Remington.

Collector Garrett had commented on the Ahmedabad municipality in 1925 that it was "*very active in the disposal of business… much credit is due to the present board and its President for infusing a new life into municipal administration* ." Later, Commissioner Smart had admired "*the enthusiasm with which various departments of the municipality were functioning* "{RG2/L-2355} .

In sharp contrast to Sardar, Jawaharlal Nehru, as head of the Allahabad municipality, couldn't really deliver, and chose to resign. Although enthusiastic, he was more of a pen-pusher, and didn't have the tact to practically achieve his goals. Allahabad and Ahmedabad municipality had similar problems and issues, but while Sardar succeeded in Ahmedabad, Nehru failed in Allahabad. *The ability and the position didn't seem to have changed after independence: whatever Sardar took responsibility of succeeded, while Nehru floundered from one blunder to another* .

## Patel's Work during Ahmedabad Floods 1927

Commencing 23 July 1927, Ahmedabad experienced heavy downpour that ceased only by 29 July 1927. In mere six consecutive days Ahmedabad received massive 52 inches (1320.8 mm) of rain against an average of just 30 inches (762 mm) of rain for the whole year. Compare this with Mumbai's worst rains on 26 July 2005 of 944 mm on a single day (in 24 hours)! Chennai had received 345 mm rains in 24 hours on 1 December 2015, and a total of 1197 mm of rains during the whole of November 2015. Over 4000 villages around Ahmedabad were marooned in five feet deep water. The grim picture stretched for miles. Many houses had collapsed. As the water rose many took shelter on tree-tops.

Vallabhbhai went around with his colleagues even during nights to monitor the status and to ensure whatever could be done was done by the municipal staff and volunteers. He organised a large contingent of volunteers. Thanks to Patel's efforts, the staggering problem was contained. Hugh Garrett, an ICS officer, worked closely with Patel for flood-relief for many months. He was all praise for Patel's organising abilities, decisiveness, honesty and frankness. Sardar's humanitarian efforts for months on end were widely appreciated. It was realised that

the government despite its vast resources could not have done what Patel and his team accomplished. To see for themselves the muchacclaimed achievement, Lady Irwin and Viceroy Irwin visited Gujarat in December 1927.{BK/195}

The British administrators were so impressed they sought Sardar Patel's permission to recommend him for suitable honours. Sardar, of course, declined the offer.

## Patel's Bardoli Satyagraha 1928

The government of the Bombay Presidency, rather than providing succour to the people of Bardoli in Gujarat severely affected by floods and famine since 1925, raised land revenue by 30% in 1927. Petitions from civic groups had no effect. What is noteworthy is that the arbitrary enhancement of 30%, as a part of periodic revision, was recommended not by an Englishman, but by an Indian member of the Provincial Civil Service (PCS), MS Jayakar, who then was Deputy Collector of Surat. {MD2/14}

*Indians in the ICS and PCS were prone to indulgence in such acts at the cost of their compatriots to suck up to their British masters, and demonstrate their loyalty (servility)* .

When farmers, along with the Gujarati activists Narhari Parikh, Ravi Shankar Vyas, and Mohanlal Pandya, approached Patel, who had earlier led the Kheda struggle, to lead an agitation to bring relief to people, Patel minced no words in frankly advising them the tremendous hardships they would be subjected to if they refused payment of taxes, as it was likely to lead to strong-arm tactics, confiscation of their property, and jail.

Addressing the peasants on 12 February 1928, he said:

"I still ask you to think twice before you take the plunge. Do not derive comfort from the feeling that you have as your leader a fighter like myself. Forget me and forget my companions. Fight, if you feel you must resist oppression and injustice. Do not take the plunge lightly. If you miserably fail, you will not rise again for several years. But if you succeed, you will have done much to lay the foundations of Swaraj."{MD2/34}

Patel addressed scores of meetings in language understood by the

rural folk. The exceptional eloquence of his speeches, laced with popular rural similes and metaphors and sarcasm and anecdotes, moved them immensely.

When the villagers expressed their resolve not to bend down to injustice and face the worst, Patel agreed to back them. Patel, in turn, asked for Gandhi's support. Gandhi advised that neither he (Gandhi) himself nor the Congress could directly involve themselves. But when Patel assured him of hopeful prospects given the resolve of the villagers, Gandhi agreed to give his blessings.

Patel organised villages under a set of leaders and volunteers, and also planted informers within the government departments to know in advance their various moves. Villages were grouped into 18 sectors, each under a sector-commander. Under each sector-commander were sets of volunteers designated as 'sainiks' (soldiers). It was all on a military pattern. Sector-commanders included people like Ravishankar Maharaj, Mohanlal Pandya, Dr Chunilal Mehta and wife, Ambalal Patel, Patel's daughter Maniben Patel, Mithuben Petit of the rich Parsi family of Bombay, Abba Saheb Tayabji, Abdul Kadar Bavazir, and others. Peasants of all castes and religions participated in the satyagraha. {BK/118-20}

Patel started by first writing to the Governor of Bombay to reduce the taxes for the year. The Governor responded by announcing the date of collection of taxes. Patel then promptly gave a call to the villagers to refuse payment of taxes. He instructed them to remain completely non-violent. Before the Government had time to assess what was happening and what lay in store, over 80,000 people had been organised into various units in a disciplined manner. The Raj later tried desperately to break them up, but in vain.

At the advice of Patel, and aided by his group of leaders and volunteers, the farmers had prepared themselves for all eventualities, hiding their precious belongings with their relatives staying in other unaffected parts of Gujarat; and had also arranged for supplies and logistics from supporters and sympathisers outside. In other words, it was a well-planned, well thought-out, and well-organised agitation.

A "war"-bulletin, *Larat-ki-Patrika* , was published and circulated on a daily basis to keep everyone informed and geared up, and it was eagerly lapped up by the villagers. To keep up the morale, Sardar Patel had also arranged for *Bhajan Mandalis* (groups of musicians) to go

around villages each night to sing national and religious songs. The *Bhajan Mandalis* also included story-tellers to regale the audience with interesting and inspiring anecdotes and short-stories. To keep track on what was happening on the ground, and to boost morale of the villagers, Sardar Patel used to visit villages in the night, returning to his headquarters only at daybreak.{MD2/36-40}{BK/118-9}

The way Sardar Patel had organised about 87,000 villagers into a robust and fearless non-cooperation movement made an English correspondent comment in 'The Times of India' of 4 July 1928 that Sardar Patel had "*instituted there* [Bardoli] *a Bolshevik regime in which he plays the role of Lenin* ."{BK2/39} An Indian member of the Bombay Legislative Council remarked: "*If Bardoli stands firm until the last, this fight will be the first nail in the British coffin* ."{MD2/70}{BK/124}

Notable in the struggle was the participation of women, which Patel encouraged. Their bravery inspired their men to be even more committed.

As expected, the Government left no stone unturned to crush the agitation. Bands of Pathans mobilised by the government from India's northwest terrorised the farmers, and aided the Tax inspectors in forcibly seizing property, including cattle. Auctions of confiscated properties began to be organised. But, hardly anyone from Gujarat came forward to buy. Some greedy ones who showed up faced social boycott.

To break the morale, the administration locked up about 17,000 agitators with some 40,000 seized buffaloes in a disease-prone, smelly, small, insanitary hell of a place for over three months.

There was heavy criticism of the government action all over. Ultimately, in 1928, the government had no alternative but to offer certain terms of settlement to Sardar: terms included cancellation of revenue for the year, scale-back of the 30% rise in taxes, and return of confiscated lands and properties. However, Sardar Patel rebuffed the same, considering them inadequate. But, Gandhi agreed to government's terms, and therefore Sardar acquiesced. As we would see later too for all his major agitations, Gandhi was always game for compromise, even if his demands were not fulfilled. Why?

The resounding success of the agitation made Patel a national hero. The women of Bardoli bestowed the title 'SARDAR' (Chief or Leader)

on Patel.

What was noteworthy about the Bardoli Satyagraha was that it was the first successful practical implementation of the Gandhian nonviolent technique involving the rural masses on the ground. What was even more noteworthy was that it was not Gandhi who made that Gandhian technique successful through the rural masses, but it was Sardar! Patel made people cast off their fear, and turned every village into a citadel of resistance. He inspired people to be courageous, selfreliant, sacrificing, resourceful, self-organising, united, patient, and fearless, and ready to face difficulties.

Mahadev Desai had commented that *Vallabhbhai* , '*who had in him the blood of generations of peasants* ', could organize the Bardoli populace '*in a form in which* (Gandhi) *could have never done* '. Unlike the Mahatma he spoke the language of the soil and as a Patidar he belonged to the community that comprised the satyagraha's backbone. {RG/158-9}

Wired Subhas Chandra Bose to Patel: "All India rejoices with you on glorious victory. All honour to satyagrahis and their leader."{BK/134}

# Congress Call for "Purna Swaraj", 1930

It is worth noting that the Congress called for full independence only as late as 1930! The *Purna Swaraj Declaration* , or the *Declaration of the Independence of India* , was promulgated by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930. The flag of India was hoisted at midnight on 31 December 1929 on the banks of the Ravi river at Lahore by Jawaharlal Nehru, who, overriding the much-deserving Sardar Patel (considering Sardar's suitability, seniority and the Bardoli triumph), had been unjustly anointed the Congress President by Gandhi, "inheriting" that post from his father Motilal!

The Declaration of Independence was officially promulgated on 26 January 1930; and the Congress called upon Indians to observe 26 January as the Independence Day. Although with the transfer of power to Indians by the British on 15 August 1947, 15 August became the official *Independence Day.* The new *Constitution of India* declaring India as a republic took effect on 26 January 1950, making 26 January the *Republic Day* .

Dandi March, Salt Satyagraha, Sardar's Preparation, 1930

The government had levied tax on the manufacture and sale of salt, an item used by all—rich and poor. To Gandhi breaking the Salt Law appeared to be a fit case for peaceful civil disobedience, to gain publicity, and to mobilise masses: everyone could participate in it scoop salt at the coast, or just sell and buy salt without paying tax.

To gain maximum Indian and international publicity, Gandhi planned a long 390 km march from his Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad to the coastal Gujarat village of Dandi near Navsari, where his group planned to produce salt at the coast without paying tax. 78 people began the march with Gandhi on 12 March 1930, and arrived at Dandi after a 24 day walk on 5 April 1930, breaking the Salt Law at 6.30am the next day on 6 April 1930. Many people had joined the group along the way. The march turned into a grand media event.

Gandhi had appointed Sardar Patel as the Grand Commander for the march. Dandi and the Salt Route were Patel's choice. Sardar did a fine job, delivering fiery speeches along the route, and mobilising and inspiring people. Remarked Pattabhi Sitaramayya: "*While yet Gandhi was making preparations, Vallabhbhai went before his master to prime up the villagers for the coming ordea* ls…"{BK2/45} That resulted in his arrest before he could reach the destination. Gandhi commented that Patel was arrested because the government "*feared that if he were free, he and not the government would rule over the district* ."{BK2/45}

In Sabarmati jail, Patel was lodged in a cell meant for those awarded capital punishment, denied any amenities, and provided horrible food. His cell used to be locked up for the night at 5.30 pm. Despite the treatment Patel told his visitors in the presence of jail officials: "*Don't worry about me. I am happy as a bird. There is only one thing which bothers me* ." After a pause, he added in the presence of his Indian jailers: "*What worries me is that all the people in charge of the jail here are Indians! It is through us Indians that they work this inhuman system* ."{BK/144}

British began spreading all kind of propaganda to discredit the satyagraha, and claim, among other wild nonsense, that they have been the protectors, and that but for them Hindus would be unsafe from Muslims and Pathans, with Afghans re-invading the country. In one of

his speeches Patel commented: "*Haven't they reduced us to such a helpless state after 150 years of their rule? If thirty-three crores of us cannot protect ourselves, then what is left for us to do is to commit suicide! But to tolerate such talk is a great insult* ."{BK/141}

Patel was temporarily released in the wake of the tension created by his arrest. But, he was re-arrested, along with his daughter, Maniben. Vallabhbhai remained in Sabarmati Jail from 7 March 1930 to 26 June 1930. The freedom was short-lived, as he was re-arrested for leading a procession in Bombay on 31 July 1930. Released in November, he was again arrested in December 1930, and sent to Yerwada prison for 9 months.

Gandhi marched triumphantly ahead with host of processionists, making speeches along the way. The villages they passed through were festooned as if participating in a festival. Many villagers joined the march along the way. The procession gradually grew from under a hundred to a few thousand by the time they hit the destination.

After making salt at Dandi, Gandhi continued further along the coast, producing salt and addressing meetings. Rajaji had remarked perceptively: "It is not salt but disobedience that you are manufacturing."{RG3/117}

But, before the planned satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 40 km south of Dandi, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4–5 May 1930.

However, Manilal, Gandhi's second son, and Sarojini Naidu led 2500 satyagrahis to Dharasana Salt Works on 21 May 1930. As they approached the Works, they were mercilessly hit by lathis and boots on heads and body, at the instructions of 6 British officers, by about 400 Indian constables posted there. No blows were returned. About 320 were injured.

The Satyagraha continued for about a year at various places in India. Gandhi was released from jail unconditionally on 26 January 1931. He later met with Lord Irwin (1881-1959), the Viceroy of India, and agreed to call off the Satyagraha in exchange for an equal negotiating role at the Second Round Table Conference at London on India's future. However, the negotiations failed to yield any major concession from the British!

Gandhi-Irwin Pact was signed off on 5 March 1931. Under the Gandhi-Irwin Pact, the British acceded to NO major demand of the Congress. *It was effectively a failure of Gandhi's Salt Satyagraha: his second major movement* . *Salt Laws remained intact* . There was NO provision in it for clemency to Bhagat Singh, Rajguru and Sukhdev. Gandhi, Nehru (President of the Congress then) and the Congress did little to save them.

*Vallabhbhai Patel was heartbroken at Gandhi's failure to obtain the restoration of sold lands of the peasants by the British.* The Patidars of Kheda considered the Pact a betrayal—it was the Pact, and not the Police lathis, that broke their backs! However, Patel pacified them by telling: "Don't worry about your land. It will come back to you knocking at your door." And, sure enough, after the 1937-elections when the Congress came into power in the Bombay Presidency (that included Gujarat), the land was restored.{BK2/53}

Several newspapers in London gloated on the victory of the Viceroy. Wrote 'The Times', London: "Such a victory has seldom been vouchsafed to any Viceroy." It was said that only Gandhi could have made such an agreement (being such a huge comedown), and only he could have got away with it!{Gill/59}

Lord Willingdon, who succeeded Lord Irwin as the Viceroy of India in 1931, was very rigid, and ignored many provisions of the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.

#### Sardar's Jail Terms during 1930-34

Sardar Patel was arrested during the Salt Satyagraha, and remained in Sabarmati Jail from 7 March 1930 to 26 June 1930. About a month after release, he was re-arrested for leading a procession in Bombay on 31 July 1930. Released in November 1930, he was rearrested in December 1930, and sent to Yerwada jail in Poona, from where he was released after 9 months following the Gandhi-Irwin Pact.

Following the failure of the Second Round Table Conference held in September-December 1931, Patel was arrested on 4 January 1932, along with Gandhi, but although Gandhi was released after about 16 months in the summer of 1933, Patel was released after over 30 months on 14 July 1934, spending time in Yerwada jail in Poona and in Nasik jail.

Sardar as Congress President, March 1931

The AICC session at Karachi was held in March 1931, at which Sardar Patel was appointed the President of the Congress (a tenure of one year) for the first (and only) time.

Gandhi faced a hostile climate at the Karachi Congress on account of his failure to save Shahid Bhagat Singh and associates. Notable at the Karachi Congress was the presence of Abdul Ghaffar Khan (who came to be known as the *Frontier Gandhi* ) from NWFP, and his *Khudai Khidmatgars* (God's Servants), popularly called *Redshirts* , on account of the brick-red colour of their shirt.

Patel established a landmark at the session by insisting that its proceedings be conducted in *Hindi* , the country's proposed national language after independence. The Indianisation was initiated by Gandhi and Patel in the Ahmedabad Congress of 1921.

At the Karachi Congress Patel established himself as the party's boss. Wrote William Shirer, a US journalist who covered the session:

"There was one figure in Karachi, little known in the West but a power in India… Next to Gandhi, it was Vallabhbhai Patel, India's nearest thing to an old Tammany Hall boss, who ran the convention… it had been Patel, a bald-headed, walrusmoustached, tough-minded, pragmatic, peasant lawyer, who built up the Congress to a formidable national political party, the only one there was in India. He was the boss of the machine."{Shir}

#### Sardar & Elections 1934-37

Gandhi had taken a decision in 1934 not to boycott elections. *Soon after release from jail in July 1934, Patel devoted himself to 1934 elections to the Central Legislative Assembly, playing the leading role in selecting and financing candidates. He became the chairman of the party's Central Parliamentary Board, and also its main fund-raiser. He also guided the Congress through the Provincial elections of 1936* , following the GoI Act of 1935.

In the Central Legislative Assembly of 145, 41 seats were for the

nominated, unelected members, leaving 104 for elected members. Out of that 104, 8 seats were reserved for Europeans, and 11 for landlords and others, leaving a net of 85 seats. Out of them, in 1934, the Congress won 44 of the 49 general seats, and 17 of the reserved seats —a total of 61 out of a possible maximum of 85, almost 72%. However, given 41 unelected/nominated seats, the Congress could not have a majority.

The British Parliament passed the Government of India Act in August 1935, which included, inter alia, further provisions for direct elections.

In the 1936-37 provincial elections in 11 provinces, the Congress won an absolute majority in 5 (UP, Bihar, Madras, CP (Central Provinces) and Orissa), and emerged as the largest party in 4 (Bombay, Bengal, Assam and NWFP). The Congress ministries were formed in a total of 8 provinces. They were headed (called Premiers) by Govind Ballabh Pant in UP, Shrikrishna Sinha in Bihar, NB Khare in CP, BG Kher in Bombay, Rajaji in Madras. Bishwanath Das in Orissa, Gopinath Bardoloi in Assam, and Dr Khan Sahib in NWFP.

Overall, in the assembly (provincial) elections, the Congress had won 715 of 1585 seats—less than 50%—and it had polled about 94 lakh votes against the total of all the opposition of about 110 lakh votes —again less than 50%: as such, the Congress had no reason to be too arrogant! Jinnah's Muslim League won a total of 108 seats across India, including 20 of the 30 Muslim seats in the Bombay Assembly; and 27 seats in UP against 134 of the Congress. Further, the Congress had contested only 58 of the 482 Muslim seats and won just 26—15 in NWFP, and only 11 in the rest of India.

The Muslim League gave a poor showing. It secured less than 5% of the Muslim votes. It won a mere 6% (108/1585) of total seats. Its share (108/(372+108=480)) in the Muslim seats was also low: 22.5%. It failed to form a government on its own in any province.

Described Ayesha Jalal: "But for Jinnah the results of the 1937 elections proved another setback in a career marked more by snakes than by ladders. In the Punjab, the Unionists swept the board; in Bengal, Jinnah and the League had to accept a coalition led by Hug who did not acknowledge their writ; in Sind they faced an independent ministry; and in the N.W.F.P., where almost the entire population was Muslim, the worst humiliation of all, a Congress ministry. In each of the [Muslim] majority provinces, Jinnah's strategy had been repudiated by the voters' choice. In the Muslim-minority provinces, where the League did best, the Congress did much better than anyone had expected, and did not need the League's help to form stable ministries."{Jal/35}

Patel, Bose & Haripura Session 1938

The 1938 session of the Congress was held at Haripura, on the banks of Tapti, in Bardoli taluka in Gujarat. It was a grand and massive affair, and was meticulously planned and managed by Sardar Patel. Villagers in Haripura had temporarily lent about 500 acres for the purpose. Tractors were used to level ground. Lodging for about 75,000 persons was arranged in tents and bamboo structures. Roads were readied. A pontoon bridge was laid over Tapti. A temporary arrangement was done for the following: a post office, a telephone exchange, a bank, a hospital, and a bus stand. Hundreds of cows

were brought in advance for milk and ghee. About 2,000 volunteers were deployed for the kitchen, and for other services.

Sardar Patel gave the magnificent temporary town the name *Vithal Nagar* in the memory of his elder brother Vithalbhai. Prominent artists from Gujarat and Nandalal Bose from Shantiniketan adorned the place with their creations and paintings. A special, beautiful cottage with a grand view of the river and greenery around was made for the president of the Congress, *Subhas Bose* . Thousands of villagers visited the place. They were provided food at a tenth of a rupee.

#### Resignation of Ministries, 1939: Sardar's Opposition

Good Show by the Congress in 1936-37 Elections thanks to Sardar

In the 1936-37 provincial elections in 11 provinces, the Congress won an absolute majority in 5 (UP, Bihar, Madras, CP (Central Provinces) and Orissa), and emerged as the largest party in 4 (Bombay, Bengal, Assam and NWFP). The Congress ministries were formed in a total of 8 provinces. (Please see details above.)

On the other hand, the Muslim League's show was poor. It secured less than 5% of the Muslim votes. It won a mere 6% (108/1585) of total seats. Its share (108/(372+108=480)) in the Muslim seats was also low: 22.5%. It failed to form a government on its own in any province. This rankled with Jinnah and the AIML, and also with the British, who didn't want the Congress to get powerful.

#### Good Performance of Ministries during 1937-39—Monitored by Sardar

The hard-won (thanks mainly to the efforts of Sardar Patel) Congress ministries in the provinces since 1937, under the strict vigilance of Patel, had begun to perform better than expected. To guide and coordinate the activities of the provincial governments, a central control board known as the Parliamentary Sub-Committee was formed, with Sardar Patel, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Rajendra Prasad as members. A number of measures in the interest of the general public had been taken. Many Congress ministers set an example in plain living. They reduced their own salaries. They made themselves easily accessible to the common people. In a very short time, a very large

number of ameliorative legislations were pushed through in an attempt to fulfil many of the promises made in the Congress election manifesto.

Emergency powers acquired by the provincial governments through the Public Safety Acts and the like were repealed. Bans on illegal political organizations such as the Hindustan Seva Dal and Youth Leagues and on political books and journals were lifted. All restrictions on the press were removed. Securities taken from newspapers and presses were refunded and pending prosecutions were withdrawn. The blacklisting of newspapers for purposes of government advertising was given up. Confiscated arms were returned and forfeited arms licenses were restored. In the Congress provinces, police powers were curbed and the reporting of public speeches and the shadowing of political workers by CID agents stopped. Another big achievement of the Congress Governments was their firm handling of the communal riots. Rajaji's premiership of Madras during 1937-39 was brilliant.

#### Britain Declared War (WW-II) on behalf of India

The German–Soviet Non-aggression Pact, also called the Molotov– Ribbentrop Pact, or the Nazi–Soviet Pact, was signed between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in Moscow on 23 August 1939, in the presence of Stalin. Soon after, on 1 September 1939, Germany invaded Poland (Soviet Union did so on 17 September 1939). In response, Britain declared war against Germany two days later—on 3 September 1939. *On the same day, the Viceroy of India, Linlithgow, also announced that India, along with Britain, had joined the war (WW-II)* .

# Nehru-Socialists Force Ministries to Resign, despite Sardar's Opposition

The Congress had expected to be consulted by the British before declaring war on behalf of India. The AICC had declared in May 1939 that the Congress would oppose any attempt to impose a war on India without the consent of its people. Yet, the British authorities just didn't bother. The Congress felt rebuffed and enraged. It also demonstrated that the British considered the Gandhian 'threat' as no threat. They knew that the Gandhian non-violence was an insurance against any real problem for the Raj.

In protest against the British-India declaring war without consulting

the Congress, the CWC meeting at Wardha on 22-23 October 1939 decided not to co-operate with the British in the war (WW-II). The move was spear-headed by Nehru and the socialists, who also advocated that the Congress Provincial Governments resign by the month-end in protest. Patel and Gandhi were not in favour of non-cooperation with the British in the war, and of the ministries resigning. However, Under pressure from Nehru&Co, the Congress Ministries resigned in November 1939—a mega-blunder.

# Pearl Harbor (Dec-1941) & its Aftermath

The Japanese Navy carried out a surprise attack against the US naval base at Pearl Harbor situated in the US territory of Hawaii at 7.48am Hawaiian time on 7 December 1941. It was a massive attack in two waves involving 353 Japanese fighters, bombers, and torpedo planes launched from six aircraft carriers causing enormous loss to the US Navy: four of its battleships were sunk, while the remaining four were extensively damaged; additionally one minelayer, one anti-aircraft training ship, three cruisers, and three destroyers were badly hit, 188 aircrafts were destroyed, 2403 Americans were killed, while 1178 were wounded.

Both the scale and the unexpectedness of the unprovoked attack profoundly shocked the Americans. The attack happened without a declaration of war by Japan or without explicit warning.

What was Japan's rationale? Japan was planning attack in Southeast Asia against the overseas territories of the US, the UK, and the Netherlands. The attack was meant to deter the US from interfering in its plans. The Pearl Harbor attack was followed by Japanese attacks on the UK-held Malaya, Singapore, and Hong Kong, and the US-held Philippines, Guam and Wake Island.

# The US joins the War

US domestic support for non-intervention that had been getting weaker following the fall of France turned belligerent; and following the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States declared war on Japan on 8 December 1941. With the US on their side the position of the *Allies* strengthened.

#### Change in the Position of the Congress

Taking cognizance of the changed world situation in the wake of the Pearl Harbor, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting at the end of December 1941 at Bardoli in Gujarat recognised India could not be defended non-violently against a Japanese invasion. (—*A profound realisation! As if against an invader other than Japan non-violent means would have worked!)* At the persuasion of Rajaji, subject to the declaration of freedom for India, the CWC offered cooperation with the Allies. Gandhi did not oppose, but made it clear that he would not lead a Congress ready to join a war. In other words, the CWC yielded on non-violence.

#### Cripps Mission, Mar-Apr 1942

Following the successful Japanese navy attack on the Pearl Harbor situated in the US territory of Hawaii on 7 December 1941, the Japanese blitzkrieg triumphantly rolled through the Wake Island (then under the US), the Philippines (then under the US), Malaysia (then under the British), Indonesia, Singapore (then under the British), and then Burma (Myanmar, then under the British). Rangoon fell on 7 March 1942. With that, the attack on India seemed imminent.

Looking to the critical situation, the US President Roosevelt and the Chinese Generalissimo Chiang urged the British PM Churchill to make a reconciliatory move towards the Congress to gain co-operation in the ongoing war. Churchill was reluctant, but once Rangoon fell, he was forced to make a move. He announced a mission to Delhi under the Leader of the House, Sir Stafford Cripps.

Sir Richard Stafford Cripps (1889–1952) arrived in Delhi on 22 March 1942 along with his team. Cripps was a Labour MP, the leader of the House of Commons, and a member of the British War Cabinet. He had brought with him a new constitutional scheme approved by the British Cabinet. In return, the British sought co-operation in the warefforts. The team spent three weeks in India in March and April 1942, and had prolonged discussions with the concerned parties. Nehru and Maulana Azad were the official negotiators for the Congress.

Cripps announced his proposals in the form of Draft Declaration on 30 March 1942:{BKM}

(1)Right away, India could have a national government composed of representatives of the leading political parties.

(2)Formation of a post-war Constituent Assembly whose members would be chosen by provincial legislatures or nominated by the princes.

(3)India to be granted full Dominion Status after the war, with the right of secession from the Commonwealth.

(4)Secession clause: Once India became a Dominion after the war, every province would have the right to secede and obtain a status equal to that of the Indian Dominion.{BKM}

Both Gandhi and Patel rejected the proposal, mainly on account of the *secession clause* . Rajaji, Nehru and Maulana Azad, however, desired continuance of talks with Cripps. Though *Patel* was of the opinion "*no more mischievous scheme had been conceived* " {RG/306} about the Cripps Plan, he didn't mind continuance of talks, something Gandhi felt was pointless, and was annoyed about.

If one examines the above, and what India got in 1947 (Dominion Status), the only objectionable clause appears to the fourth-clause, the secession-clause. Both the Congress and the Muslim League had problems with it, but in an opposite sort of way. Jinnah termed the secession clause as an implicit recognition of Pakistan; but rejected the proposal, as what he wanted was an explicit recognition of the right of the "Muslim nation" to separate. Gandhi, and many other Congress leaders expressed their disapproval of the proposal principally on account of the secession clause.

The British had perhaps put the clause to make it partially acceptable to both: No explicit Pakistan, to satisfy the Congress; and a possibility of Pakistan through the secession-clause to satisfy the Muslim League, and serve their [British] own selfish intentions too.

Gandhi had called Cripps's offer "*a post-dated cheque* ", to which someone added "*on a failing bank* " {Wiki4} . Why? Looking to the way Japan was trouncing the British and the US in SE-Asia, and was in Burma, at India's doors, the Congress was elated Japan was doing their work of evicting the British. They had already written-off the British! Hence the term "the failing bank", and the "post-dated cheque" that was bound to bounce as the British would not have anything to give anyway. Such a faulty reading of the likely scenario was thanks to Gandhi, Nehru & Company's naivete on military and international affairs!

Rather than considering the offer seriously and negotiating on the secession-clause; driven by hubris thanks to Japan's military success, and over-confident they had an upper hand, and that the British were in dire need of their co-operation, they acted difficult and unreasonable. Had they made sensible negotiation on the secession-clause India could have got the self-government five years earlier, and there would perhaps have been no partition and Pakistan. Attlee had commented: "*It was a great pity that eventually the Indians turned this down, as full self-government might have been ante-dated by some years* ."{JA/232}

Nehru and Company (Maulana Azad, etc.) were most vehement in their rejection of the Cripps Plan, and it was their inflexibility, along with that of Gandhi, that carried the day. Surprisingly, the irritant was not the secession clause (Had they indirectly and implicitly conceded Pakistan? During the discussions, Nehru and Azad had even clarified that they could not "think in terms of compelling the people of any territorial unit to remain in an Indian Union against their declared and established will".{RG2/L-5260} )

Nehru had two objections:

*One* . The proposed new cabinet to be installed right away of the Congress and other politicians would not have the final authority, and that the Viceroy would not just be a constitutional head, but would have a veto. In war-time, could the British have left things to quibbling and sissy Congress politicians!? In this context it is worth noting that it was principally Nehru who ensured Mountbatten as the first Governor General of Free India after independence, and allowed him to take crucial decisions, including that on Kashmir—which proved disastrous for India!

*Two* . The defence would remain in the charge of the British Commander-in-Chief. Nehru wanted full control over the armed forces. The British handing Defence Ministry to the Congress politicians during the war-time was unthinkable. Did the Congress politicians have any knowledge and expertise in defence matters and war? What happened post-independence in J&K and in India-China war is well-known! Further, post-independence Free India indeed had a British Commander-in-Chief. How did Nehru accept that as PM of Free India? In short, among the main leaders responsible for the failure of the Cripps Mission was Nehru. Unsuccessful, Cripps left India on 12 April 1942.

Another view is that the Cripps Mission was forced on the British by the US to get the Indian cooperation during the war. Forced into it, Churchill and Viceroy Linlithgow deliberately introduced the secession clause to ensure the Mission was aborted. In any case the terms could have been better and reasonably negotiated by Nehru and Azad who were entrusted with the responsibility; because it was not as if India got better terms in 1947—the secession did happen!

Quit India Movement 1942

Call for "Quit India" & its Background

Judging (or mis-judging) the time as opportune (reverses of the Allies in WW-II, and the British vulnerability), Gandhi proposed calling upon the British to quit India, failing which the Congress would launch a struggle to enforce it.

Nehru and Rajaji tried hard and long to resist Gandhi's proposal. They were of the opinion the Indians must help the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers, and should not therefore weaken the position of the British. Nehru had changed his tune after Communist Russia had joined the forces with the Allies. Patel supported Gandhi most vehemently.

Finally, all except Rajaji came around and accepted Gandhi's proposal with certain modifications in its wordings. The Quit India resolution stated among other things, that if the British did not accept its appeal, the Congress would "be reluctantly compelled to utilize all its non-violent strength". Gandhi also hinted that unlike before, "Quit India" would not necessarily be halted if non-Congressmen committed acts of violence. "Quit India" was endorsed by the CWC on 14 July 1942.

Soon after, Patel put his heart, soul and body into preparation for the big event. In various public and private meetings he exhorted people for an all-out struggle: non-payment of taxes, civil disobedience, abstention from work, strike by the government employees in various departments like railways, P&T, schools, colleges, and so on, with a view to bring the entire government machinery to a standstill. He also told that the struggle would not be halted even if violence erupts. He wanted people to carry forward the struggle if the leaders are arrested.

Patel expected the struggle to be short and swift.

Gandhi, in a press conference on 15 July 1942, had declared he would launch a non-violent rebellion against the British Raj. The CWC prepared a draft Quit India resolution on 7 August 1942 which was presented to and passed by the AICC at the end of its two-day meeting (7–8 Aug) at Gowalia Tank in Mumbai on 8 August 1942.

Gandhi sent Miss Madeleine Slade (Miraben) to the Viceroy to personally explain the resolution. Gandhi did not expect any immediate action from either side, or any confrontation. He wanted to use the resolution as a bargaining counter, and expected talks and negotiations. However, being war-time, and having noted the threat of Gandhi's rebellion, the Viceroy was in no mood to play soft and patient. He refused an interview to Slade, and let it be known that the government would neither stand any rebellion, violent or non-violent, nor would it discuss with anyone who talks in such terms.{Azad/84}

#### Poor Preparation, Arrests & Flop-Show

Unlike the meticulous preparation done by Sardar Patel both for the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928 and for the Salt Satyagraha of 1930; Gandhi and the Congress had hardly done the required preparation to execute their planned mass movement of "Quit India" on a massive scale, despite that being their only preoccupation. However, the Raj despite its many responsibilities of governance and preparations for the war—had geared itself fully to crush the impending "Quit India". The Raj had made elaborate plans for arrests. It promptly acted to nip "Quit India" in the bud by promptly arresting all the Congress leaders. The Congress organisation was outlawed. Gandhi and the AICC hadn't anticipated such a strong and prompt reaction from the Raj. Why? Did they expect the Raj to be as laid back as they were? The Raj was better organized for crushing the revolt than Congress was for executing it—despite crushing the revolt being only one of the many responsibilities (governance, preparations for war, etc.) being shouldered by the Raj, while organising the revolt was the only responsibility of the Congress. It exposed the huge gulf in relative competence.

After the passing of the 'Quit India' resolution, Gandhi, in his address to the delegates after midnight, had said, inter alia: "…The actual struggle does not commence this very moment… My first act will

be to wait upon His Excellency the Viceroy and plead with him for the acceptance of the Congress demand. This may take two or three weeks… What are you going to do in the meanwhile? There is the spinning-wheel…"{CWMG/Vol-83/319}

Churchill's War Cabinet's best offer in the form of Cripp's Proposals having been rebuffed, the Raj had was fully prepared to crush the Congress. They had learnt a lesson from the Salt March—not to give a long rope to Gandhi. This time they decided to swoop down, arrest all leaders, and nip the agitation in the bud.

Gandhi, Sardar Patel, Kriplani, Maulana Azad, Nehru, and the rest of the CWC, along with Mahadev Desai, Sarojini Naidu, Mirabehn, Asoka Mehta and others were arrested on the morning of 9 August 1942. Gandhi, Mahadev Desai, and several more were taken to the Aga Khan Palace, Pune; some were taken to Yerwada Jail, Pune; and Sardar Patel, Nehru, Maulana Azad, Acharya Kriplani, Shankar Rao Deo, Dr Prafulla Chandra Ghosh, Asaf Ali, and Dr Syed Mahmud were taken to Ahmednagar Fort (in Maharashtra) that served as a jail then. Dr Rajendra Prasad was not with them as, being ill, he had not attended the AICC at Bombay—he was arrested and jailed in Bihar. Although a warship was kept ready at Bombay harbour to deport them all outside India, the Raj finally chose to confine them in India. Rajaji was not arrested as he had resigned from the Congress in July 1942, and had kept aloof from Quit India. Sardar Patel's son and daughter, Dahyabhai and Maniben, were also jailed.

Thus, hardly had the "Quit India" started when all the top leaders were in jail. Gandhi was much dejected by the arrests. He expected negotiations, not arrests. Gandhi had indeed told his secretary before going to bed in the early hours of 9 August 1942 that, "*After my last night's speech, they [the British] will not arrest me* ."{Nan/463}

Why shouldn't Gandhi and others have planned for such an eventuality, and for the leadership to go underground, and carry forward the movement? With no proper guidance or leadership, the Movement turned into anarchy. Gandhi had grandly stated: "*I want freedom immediately, this very night, before dawn if it could be had* ."{Gill/39} Only if wishes were horses!

#### Gandhi's Fast, Feb 1943

British propaganda had been insinuating that Gandhi was pro-

Japan; and that he had indirectly provoked, if not actually plotted, the violence that had occurred during 'Quit India'. Taking offence, Gandhi demanded proof from the authorities. When there was no response, he went on a fast on 10 February 1943. The Raj did not bother. It was indeed hoping Gandhi would succumb to his fast. Reportedly, it was even ready for his cremation on the grounds of the Aga Khan Palace. The fast ended on 3 March 1943.

#### Quit India Momentum

Although the Congress leaders who had given a call for 'Quit India' were in jail before the movement barely started, the general public showed enthusiasm protesting in streets, educational institutions and villages. Here and there trains were derailed, telephone and telegraph wires cut, and police stations and post offices were attacked. About a thousand were killed in firing in the next few months; and about a lakh were jailed.

Quit India was brutally put down by the British, and it petered out soon enough, except for a few random token protests. It unfortunately didn't take the scale Gandhi, Patel and other leaders had hoped for. But, that was logically expected. If you have not put in the required strategy, planning and efforts, how can you expect results from disorganised public, with no definite directions? In fact, 'Quit India' soon degenerated into an ill-organised upheaval: anti-social elements and communists began harming the Indian interests themselves. The back of the struggle was broken by the Raj in less than two months: by end of September 1942 it had been largely controlled.

Wrote Durga Das: "The Quit India movement then degenerated into an ill-organised mass upheaval, lit up as much by acts of surprising individual ingenuity and heroism as by crude outbursts of incendiarism and looting. Anti-social elements and the Communists indulged in violence and destruction… But the back of the struggle had been broken by the end of September [1942]."{DD/206}

Sadly, 'Quit India' did not encompass all of India. It was mostly confined to Bengal, Bihar, Delhi, Rajputana, and United Provinces. There was little action in South India, and elsewhere.

"Quit India" Misgivings among Congress Leaders

During their time in jail in Ahmednagar, Nehru, Maulana Azad, and

Asaf Ali began to feel they had erred in following Gandhi for "Quit India". Azad used to even get angry at times when someone brought up the topic of Gandhian doctrine. Azad felt that his "reading of the situation was correct", and that "events showed that Gandhi was wrong"{Azad/90,92} . Nehru tended to agree with him.

Co-prisoner Mahtab recalled: "Maulana [Azad] used to criticise Gandhi [and say], 'His judgement was wrong and he forced his movement on all of us, but what was expected of him he did not do. We had thought that he would stake his life and go on an indefinite fast, but he hasn't done it.'"{RG/327}

Strangely, Nehru would justify "Quit India" in later years, after independence, as inevitable and necessary. Nehru, by nature, was never sure of himself, and changed his stand as suited the situation. Nehru said in 1956: "I don't think that the action we took in 1942 could have been avoided or ought to have been avoided. If we had been passive then, I think we would have lost all our strength."

## Sardar's Position

Vallabhbhai Patel, on the other hand, had no regrets on Quit India. By nature, Patel, being a man of action, was generally very clear on "what, why and how" of things. Nobody could force him to do what he was not convinced about. In short, Patel was a person who knew his mind, while Nehru was a person who did not. Patel was always willing to take responsibility for his actions, was not given to regretting his actions, or blaming others. Patel felt the steps taken by Gandhi were necessary, and not doing what he did might have meant gradual irrelevance of the Congress.

Yet, the inadequate preparation for the struggle by Gandhi rankled Patel. Also, he realised that Gandhian methods were too idealistic, and took excruciatingly long; and rather than surrendering to Gandhi's instincts and methods, it might be wiser to be prudent and practical, and to independently evaluate the options, and, if necessary in the interest of the nation, even go against the Gandhian way.

#### Exploring Ways to Quit "Quit India"

Those like Nehru and Azad who were unhappy with "Quit India" began to explore ways to quit "Quit India". Plausible excuses had to be cooked. In November 1943, Maulana Azad, with Nehru's concurrence,

suggested a letter from the CWC to the Viceroy intimating suspension of the Movement in view of the Bengal Famine, and growing threats from Japan. PC Ghosh's response to Azad-Nehru's proposal was: "I would rather take potassium cyanide and advise all of you to do the same rather than agree to any such humiliating course of action."{RG/329- 30}

## Ambedkar on 'Quit India'

Wrote Ambedkar{Amb3} : "…*The Quit India Campaign turned out to be a complete failure* . It was a mad venture and took the most diabolical form. It was a scorch-earth campaign in which the victims of looting, arson and murder were Indians and the perpetrators were Congressmen.

"Beaten, he [Gandhi] started a fast for twenty-one days in March 1943 while he was in gaol with the object of getting out of it. He failed. Thereafter he fell ill. As he was reported to be sinking the British Government released him for fear that he might die on their hand and bring them ignominy.

"On coming out of gaol, he found that he and the Congress had not only missed the bus but had also lost the road. To retrieve the position and win for the Congress the respect of the British Government as a premier party in the country which it had lost by reason of the failure of the campaign that followed up the Quit India Resolution, and the violence which accompanied it, he started negotiating with the Viceroy…"

# Kasturba's Death and Gandhi's Release in May 1944

Kasturba Gandhi (1969–1944), left to fend for herself after the arrest of Gandhi on 9 August 1942, defied a ban on meeting along with her close associate Maniben, Sardar Patel's daughter, and both got arrested. Both were sent to Aga Khan Palace where Gandhi was lodged. Kasturba had been ill for many months. She expired on 22 February 1944 on the Mahashivaratri day, aged 74.

The Raj, not wanting to take any chances, released Gandhi, who had been seriously ill, on 6 May 1944, about 10 weeks after Kasturba's death.

The Second World War ended on 8 May 1945 (about a week after Adolf Hitler had committed suicide) with the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers. Patel and others were released from Ahmednagar prison on 15 June 1945, about a month after the end of the Second World War, and over a year after the release of Gandhi (6 May 1944).

After release, Patel remained adamant on "Quit India". Said he: "Not a word of the Quit India resolution could be obliterated or altered. Indeed, if anything is to come next, it will be Quit Asia." Responded Sarat Bose, thrilled with Sardar's words: "The Sardar has always been a man of action. He has never been a coiner of phrases. True, he coined one phrase and that was Quit Asia."

#### Failure of "Quit India"

'Quit India' momentum had petered out in about three months. The impotence of the 'Quit India' became obvious from the fact that, despite Gandhi's call to the contrary, about half a million Indians joined the British army between August and December 1942!

About two years after the "Quit India" call, when Gandhi was released, there was no sign of the British packing up and quitting India. In fact, while the British Raj remained unaffected, and the strength of the Muslim League and Jinnah multiplied, the position of the Congress took a nose dive. *It was as if the Congress had "Quit" the national scene.*

Stated Churchill's friend Page Croft: "The failure of Gandhi to rouse India against the King-Emperor is one of the happiest events of the war."{PF/178}
