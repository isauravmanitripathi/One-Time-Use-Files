# Injustice to Sardar

## Injustice while Alive

Many of the injustices heaped on the Sardar have already been covered above. But, just to list a few: Gandhi-Motilal Nehru manoeuvre to bypass him from the Congress Presidentship in 1929, and thereby artificially pushing-up Nehru in the Congress hierarchy; Gandhi undemocratically anointing Nehru as the President (and hence the first PM) in 1946, ignoring the fact that 80% had voted for Sardar, and none for Nehru; Nehru and his socialist group missing no opportunity to defame or brand Patel as pro-capitalist; projecting Nehru as highly educated and knowledgeable, an intellectual and an 'internationalist', and as someone well-versed in foreign-policy, while implying Patel's weaknesses in these areas, when the facts were actually reverse; projecting Nehru as non-communal and secular, and Patel as communal, which was untrue; Nehru taking away the responsibility of Sardar on Kashmir without even the courtesy to inform him, and behaving in such a crude and bossy way with him that Sardar was forced to tender his resignation.

After independence too the efforts of Nehru, socialists, communists, and 'seculars' continued to tar Patel.

Jayaprakash Narayan(JP), a socialist, used to be in Nehru's camp. After independence the socialists had been plotting to unseat Patel from his post as Home Minister. JP had commented: "A man of 74 [Sardar Patel] has the department of which even a man of 30 would find it difficult to bear the burden." Mridula Sarabhai, who was close to Nehru, had launched a whisper campaign for Sardar's resignation. It is difficult to believe that the campaigns of both JP and Mridula did not have the blessings of Nehru, both being close to him. {Mak/129}

JP stated in 1972:

"Rajaji once unburdened his heart by publicly confessing to a

wrong he had done to Sardar Patel. I find myself in a similar situation: the dominant feeling within me today is one of selfreproach, because during his lifetime, I was not merely a critic, but an opponent of the Great Sardar."{BK/243}

Wrote Brig. BN Sharma: "…*he* [Nehru] *could be down-right petty to others. His silent encouragement of a whispering campaign branding Patel as fascist is too well known* ."{BNS/402}

Wrote historian Makkhan Lal:

"Deep inside his heart, Nehru always was a dictator and first rate politician and manipulator. He feared only Gandhi and Patel—Gandhi because of his moral authority and complete grip on the masses and Patel because of his firmness, unwillingness to be emotionally blackmailed and the writ in the party."{Mak/251}

After the death of Gandhi the only impediment to Nehru's dictatorship was Patel, and Nehru did all he could to dent his position. Patel's death had removed the only brake on Nehru.

## Belated Bharat Ratna

Bharat Ratna was awarded to Sardar Patel in 1991 and to Dr Ambedkar in 1990! And, that too because there were non-Dynasty governments since December 1989—VP Singh, then Chandra Shekhar, followed by Narsimha Rao.

Incidentally, Dr BR Ambedkar was declared as 'The Greatest Indian after Gandhi' in the Outlook–CNN-IBN– History18 TV Channel–BBC Poll, the results of which were announced on 15 August 2012. Yet, he was given Bharat Ratna only in 1990. In the Poll, while Ambedkar topped with 19,91,734 votes, Nehru, at the bottom at number 10, got just 9,921 votes!

Bose was awarded Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1992, which was later withdrawn on a legal technicality, in response to a Supreme Court directive: Government was asked to submit conclusive evidence of Netaji's death—which it could not—on a PIL as to how the award could be posthumous. However, the intriguing point is how come they thought of the award to Netaji only in 1992 even though the amendment to give awards posthumously was

made in 1955 itself?

Radhakrishnan was awarded Bharat Ratna in 1954, Rajaji in 1954, Nehru in 1955—*when he was himself the PM* , Govind Ballabh Pant in1957, BC Roy in 1961, Zakir Hussain in 1963, Indira Gandhi in 1971—*when she was herself the PM* , VV Giri in 1975, Kamaraj in 1976, Vinoba Bhave in 1983, MGR in 1988, and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991!

But, Sardar Patel, Subhas Chandra Bose and Dr Ambedkar, being not as great as these worthies(!!), got it later! The Dynasty did not like them!! It has been that personal in our feudal democracy. Of course, the only unjust thing that the Dynasty did was to have left out poor Sanjay Gandhi!

There were those who were more deserving to the many who got. For example, why not to Verghese Kurien of the Amul fame? Narayan Murthy has rightly remarked: "If our country does not stand up and salute Dr Kurien with a Bharat Ratna, then I don't know who deserves it more."

Non-dynasty greats can wait, may even die, there is no hurry. Posthumously, Ambedkar got it in 1990, Sardar Patel in 1991, Netaji Subhas Bose in 1992 and Bordoloi in 1999, when all the four of them should have been the first to get it in 1954 when the award was introduced. But, dynasty-scions, great or otherwise, can't be made to wait: two allowed themselves to be awarded Bharat Ratna when they were themselves in power—Nehru in 1955 and Indira Gandhi in 1971—while Rajiv Gandhi was awarded the same soon after his death in 1991!!

When sounded for Bharat Ratna, Maulana Azad declined and told Nehru *it was totally improper for those deciding on the awards to pin the medal on themselves* ! Azad got it posthumously.

There ought to be a provision to withdraw the awards given if it is later found that those awarded did not really deserve it.

### Treatment Post-Death

When Sardar died in Mumbai, Nehru, who himself attended the funeral, *advised the then President, Rajendra Prasad, to not attend the funeral* {DD/305} —the reason given by him was that as per the

protocol, President need not attend funerals of ministers! So he treated Sardar Patel as a mere minister—what arrogance! A disgraceful attitude, particularly when Sardar Patel had so selflessly supported him in the interest of the nation, even though Nehru had usurped the PM's post from him most undemocratically.

Wrote Stanley Wolpert:

"Gandhi's death reunited Nehru and Patel. Their reconciliation not only saved Congress and India's central government from collapse, but it kept Nehru in power. Without the Sardar's strength and support Nehru might have broken down or been forced out of high office. Vallabhbhai ran India's administration for the next two years [before his death] while Nehru indulged mostly in foreign affairs and high Himalayan adventures."{Wolp2/433}

That is what Sardar got for all he did for Nehru. But, of course, Rajendra Prasad went. Sardar was not just the Deputy PM, but was Rajendra Prasad's colleague of many, many years in the Independence Struggle.

MKK Nair, an IAS officer who was close to both Sardar Patel and VP Menon, states in his book '*The Story of an Era Told Without Illwill* ':

"Incessant differences of opinion between Nehru and Patel caused Nehru to treat Patel with personal animosity. If the great Nehru was not above harbouring personal hatred, he would not have done two things he did on the day Patel died. He sent two orders to the Home Ministry and they arrived at V P Menon's desk. The first was that the Cadillac car that Patel used should be returned the very next morning to the Foreign Ministry. Patel died in Bombay. Nehru's second memo asked officers who wished to attend his funeral to travel at their own expense. V P Menon called officers of his Ministry and, without divulging Nehru's order, asked who all were interested to attend the funeral. About a dozen officers wanted to. He bought their air tickets at his expense. When Nehru learnt about it, he was annoyed even more."{MKN} {Adv/157}

The above was confirmed when KM Munshi wrote: "When Sardar

died in Bombay, Jawaharlal issued a direction to the Ministers and Secretaries not to go to Bombay to attend the funeral. Among the Ministers, I was in Matheran (Bombay) at the time. Sri NV Gadgil, Sri Satyanarayan Sinha and Sri VP Menon disregarded the direction and attended the funeral. Jawaharlal also requested [President Dr] Rajendra Prasad not to go to Bombay; it was a strange request, to which Rajendra Prasad did not accede."{RNPS/45}

It is hard to believe the supposedly cultured person Nehru could be so ungracious and could go to such lengths upon death of a colleague and a great national leader and freedom fighter!

This is from the preface of 'Patel–A Life' by Rajmohan Gandhi {RG/ix} :

"The establishment of independent India derived legitimacy and power, broadly speaking, from the exertions of three men, Gandhi, Nehru and Patel. But while its acknowledgements are fulsome in the case of Nehru and dutiful in case of Gandhi, they are niggardly in the case of Patel.

"'That there is today an India to think and talk about,' President Rajendra Prasad wrote in his diary on May 13, 1959, 'is very largely due to Sardar Patel's statesmanship and firm administration.' 'Yet,' added Prasad, 'we are apt to ignore him.'

"Falling in 1989, the centenary of Jawaharlal's birth found expression on a thousand billboards, in commemorative TV serials, in festivals and on numerous other platforms. Occurring on October 31, 1975 … *the Patel centenary was, by contrast, wholly neglected by official India and by the rest of the Establishment* , and since then the curtain drawn on the life of one of modern India's most remarkable sons has been occasionally and partially lifted…"{RG/ix}

### No Collected Works by the Govt

This is from the foreword of S Nijalingappa to the book, 'Inside Story of Sardar Patel—The Diary of Maniben Patel: 1936- 50': "Strangely, however, while the collected works of many other leaders [notably, Nehru and Gandhi] have been published by the

government since Independence, the collected or selected works of two foremost leaders, namely Sardar Patel and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, were never taken up by any official agency. It is for this reason that we constituted the Sardar Patel Society, had it registered, collected funds and published the Collected works of Sardar Patel in fifteen volumes..."

#### No Memorial in the Capital

In the capital, in the prime area, you have Rajghat for Gandhiji, Shanti Van for Nehru, Shakti Sthal for Indira Gandhi, Veer Bhumi for Rajiv Gandhi, Vijay Ghat for Shastri, Kishan Ghat for Charan Singh, besides many museums or memorials for the Nehru-Gandhis, but no memorial to either Subhas Bose or to Sardar Patel in the capital, when next to Gandhiji the latter two deserve the highest respect!

The residence in Delhi where Sardar lived when he was the Deputy Prime Minister of the country has been razed and there is no sign that he had ever lived there. Nehru's house, on the other hand, has been turned into a museum.

Nehru's meanness and small-mindedness can be gauged from the fact that he made NO arrangements to have a portrait of Sardar Patel put up in the Central Hall of Parliament, like it was done for other prominent leaders. Apparently, he saw to it that such a portrait was not put up, like he had similarly done in case of Netaji Subhas Bose.

It was Maharaja Jivaji Rao Scindia of Gwalior, who had since become the first Rajpramukh of Madhya Bharat, who felt much irked by that glaring (and, apparently, deliberate) omission, and presented a Sardar Patel's portrait to be put up in the Central Hall of Parliament in 1954. The unveiling ceremony was performed by President Dr Rajendra Prasad.{BK/427}

### Upcoming Sardar's Statue of Unity

Thanks to the initiative of Narendra Modi, a statue of Sardar Patel would be coming up on the river island *Sadhu Bet* near Vadodara in Gujarat, facing the Narmada Dam 3.2 kilometres away. It would be called the *Statue of Unity* . The then Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stone of statue on 31 October 2013, the

138th birth anniversary of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

At 182 metres (597 feet) in height, it would be the tallest statue in the world. The aggregate height of the statue from its base would be 240 metres comprising base level of 58 metres and statue of 182 metres. The construction would use steel frame and RCC. The statue would have bronze cladding. The project area around the statue is planned to be spread over 20,000 square meters, surrounded by an artificial lake. The contract for design, construction and maintenance has been awarded to L&T for about 3,000 crores by the Gujarat State Government, and the work has commenced since October 2014. The project would be jointly financed by the State and the Union governments, and through contributions by private parties. It would take about 4 years for completion. After completion, it is expected to generate about 15,000 direct jobs for tribal people.

For visitors, access to the Statue would be via a 5 km boat ride. The base would have three-levels comprising a Memorial Garden and a large museum-exhibition hall. There would be an Observation Deck situated at a height of around 500 ft from the river bed that would provide visitors a panoramic view of the beautiful Satpura and Vindhyachal mountain ranges, the 212 km long Sardar Sarovar Reservoir, and the 12 km long Garudeshwar Reservoir. Overlooking the Narmada river and the Statue, there would be a canopied public plaza comprising food stalls, gift shops, retail kiosks and other amenities.

Not only would it be a fitting tribute to the great Sardar, who had hitherto not been given his due by the Congress governments and the Nehru-Gandhi Dynasty, it would be a breathtakingly beautiful and inspiring national monument that would become a highly sought-after and busy tourist destination, generating good business, revenues and employment.
