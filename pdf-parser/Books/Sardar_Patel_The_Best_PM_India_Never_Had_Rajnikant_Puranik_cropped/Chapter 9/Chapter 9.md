# Sardar vs. Nehru on China & Tibet

#### Sardar Patel's Approach

When one examines Nehru's disastrous and woefully irresponsible approach in respect of China and Tibet (detailed further down), one can't help wishing "*if only Sardar Patel had been there in lieu of Nehru, and Gandhi had not hoisted Nehru as the PM on India overriding Patel* ".

Sardar's Letter to Nehru on China and Tibet

Sardar Patel wrote a letter dated *7 November 1950* , about five weeks before his death, to Nehru on Tibet and China, which has since become famous for being prophetic and is often quoted. It demonstrates that Sardar Patel had a far firmer grasp on external affairs than Nehru had, and that he was a much greater internationalist. It is reproduced below verbatim (certain portions are marked in *italics* for emphasis by the author of this book).{SP2} {BK2/215- 22}{DD/471-5}

> D.O. No. 821-DPM/50 New Delhi 7 November 1950

My Dear Jawaharlal,

Ever since my return from Ahmedabad and after the cabinet meeting the same day which I had to attend at practically fifteen minutes' notice and for which I regret I was not able to read all the papers, I have been anxiously thinking over the problem of Tibet and I thought I should share with you what is passing through my mind.

I have carefully gone through the correspondence between the External Affairs Ministry and our Ambassador in Peking and through

him the Chinese Government. I have tried to peruse this correspondence as favourably to our Ambassador and the Chinese Government as possible, *but I regret to say that neither of them comes out well as a result of this study* . *The Chinese Government has tried to delude us by professions of peaceful intention* . *My own feeling is that at a crucial period they managed to instill into our Ambassador a false sense of confidence in their so-called desire to settle the Tibetan problem by peaceful means* .

There can be no doubt that during the period covered by this correspondence the Chinese must have been concentrating for an onslaught on Tibet. *The final action of the Chinese, in my judgement, is little short of perfidy. The tragedy of it is that the Tibetans put faith in us; they chose to be guided by us; and we have been unable to get them out of the meshes of Chinese diplomacy or Chinese malevolence* . From the latest position, it appears that we shall not be able to rescue the Dalai Lama.

*Our Ambassador has been at great pains to find an explanation or justification for Chinese policy and actions* . As the External Affairs Ministry remarked in one of their telegrams, there was a lack of firmness and unnecessary apology in one or two representations that he made to the Chinese Government on our behalf.

It is impossible to imagine any sensible person believing in the so-called threat to China from Anglo-American machinations in Tibet. Therefore, if the Chinese put faith in this, they must have distrusted us so completely as to have taken us as tools or stooges of Anglo-American diplomacy or strategy. This feeling, if genuinely entertained by the Chinese in spite of your direct approaches to them, indicates that even though we regard ourselves as the friends of China, the Chinese do not regard us as their friends. *With the Communist mentality of "whoever is not with them being against them", this is a significant pointer, of which we have to take due note* .

*During the last several months, outside the Russian camp, we have practically been alone in championing the cause of Chinese entry into UN* and in securing from the Americans assurances on the question of Formosa. We have done everything we could to assuage Chinese feelings, to allay its apprehensions and to defend its

legitimate claims in our discussions and correspondence with America and Britain and in the UN. In spite of this, China is not convinced about our disinterestedness; it continues to regard us with suspicion and the whole psychology is one, at least outwardly, of scepticism perhaps mixed with a little hostility.

I doubt if we can go any further than we have done already to convince China of our good intentions, friendliness and goodwill. In Peking we have an Ambassador who is eminently suitable for putting across the friendly point of view. Even he seems to have failed to convert the Chinese. *Their last telegram to us is an act of gross discourtesy not only in the summary way it disposes of our protest against the entry of Chinese forces into Tibet but also in the wild insinuation that our attitude is determined by foreign influences. It looks as though it is not a friend speaking in that language but a potential enemy* .

In the background of this, we have to consider what new situation now faces us as a result of the disappearance of Tibet, as we knew it, and the expansion of China almost up to our gates. *Throughout history we have seldom been worried about our north-east frontier. The Himalayas have been regarded as an impenetrable barrier against any threat from the north. We had a friendly Tibet which gave us no trouble.* The Chinese were divided. They had their own domestic problems and never bothered us about frontiers.

In 1914, we entered into a convention with Tibet which was not endorsed by the Chinese. We seem to have regarded Tibetan autonomy as extending to independent treaty relationship. Presumably, all that we required was Chinese counter-signature. *The Chinese interpretation of suzerainty seems to be different. We can, therefore, safely assume that very soon they will disown all the stipulations which Tibet has entered into with us in the past. That throws into the melting pot all frontier and commercial settlements with Tibet on which we have been functioning and acting during the last half a century* .

China is no longer divided. It is united and strong. All along the Himalayas in the north and north-east, we have on our side of the frontier a population ethnologically and culturally not different from

Tibetans and Mongoloids. *The undefined state of the frontier* and the existence on our side of a population with its affinities to the Tibetans or Chinese have all the elements of the potential trouble between China and ourselves. *Recent and bitter history also tells us that Communism is no shield against imperialism and that the communists are as good or as bad imperialists as any other* .

Chinese ambitions in this respect not only cover the Himalayan slopes on our side but also include the important part of Assam. They have their ambitions in Burma also. Burma has the added difficulty that it has no McMahon Line round which to build up even the semblance of an agreement. *Chinese irredentism and communist imperialism are different from the expansionism or imperialism of the western powers. The former has a cloak of ideology which makes it ten times more dangerous* .

*In the guise of ideological expansion lie concealed racial, national or historical claims. The danger from the north and north-east, therefore, becomes both communist and imperialist. While our western and north-western threat to security is still as prominent as before, a new threat has developed from the north and north-east* .

Thus, for the first time, after centuries, India's defence has to concentrate itself on two fronts simultaneously. Our defence measures have so far been based on the calculations of superiority over Pakistan. *In our calculations we shall now have to reckon with communist China in the north and in the north-east* , a communist China which has definite ambitions and aims and which does not, in any way, seem friendly disposed towards us.

Let us also consider the political conditions on this potentially troublesome frontier. Our northern and north-eastern approaches consist of Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling and the tribal areas in Assam. From the point of view of communication, there are weak spots. Continuous defensive lines do not exist. There is almost an unlimited scope for infiltration. Police protection is limited to a very small number of passes. There, too, our outposts do not seem to be fully manned. The contact of these areas with us is by no means close and intimate.

The people inhabiting these portions have no established loyalty

or devotion to India. Even Darjeeling and Kalimpong areas are not free from pro-Mongoloid prejudices. During the last three years, we have not been able to make any appreciable approaches to the Nagas and other hill tribes in Assam. *European missionaries and other visitors had been in touch with them, but their influence was in no way friendly to India or Indians* . In Sikkim, there was political ferment some time ago. It is quite possible that discontent is smouldering there.

Bhutan is comparatively quiet, but its affinity with Tibetans would be a handicap. Nepal has a weak oligarchic regime based almost entirely on force: it is in conflict with a turbulent element of the population as well as with enlightened ideas of the modern age. In these circumstances, to make people alive to the new danger or to make them defensively strong is a very difficult task indeed and that difficulty can be got over only by enlightened firmness, strength and a clear line of policy.

I am sure the Chinese and their source of inspiration, Soviet Union, would not miss any opportunity of exploiting these weak spots, partly in support of their ideology and partly in support of their ambitions. In my judgement the situation is one which we cannot afford either to be complacent or to be vacillating. We must have a clear idea of what we wish to achieve and also of the methods by which we should achieve it. *Any faltering or lack of decisiveness in formulating our objectives or in pursuing our policies to attain those objectives is bound to weaken us and increase the threats which are so evident* .

Side by side with these external dangers, we shall now have to face serious internal problems as well. I have already asked [HVR] Iyengar to send to the External Affairs Ministry a copy of the Intelligence Bureau's appreciation of these matters. Hitherto, the Communist Party of India has found some difficulty in contacting communists abroad, or in getting supplies of arms, literature, etc., from them. They had to contend with the difficult Burmese and Pakistan frontiers on the east or with the long seaboard. They shall now have a comparatively easy means of access to Chinese communists and through them to other foreign communists. Infiltration of spies, fifth columnists and communists would now be

easier.

Instead of having to deal with isolated communist pockets in Telangana and Warangal we may have to deal with communist threats to our security along our northern and north-eastern frontiers, where, for supplies of arms and ammunition, they can safely depend on communist arsenals in China.

The whole situation thus raises a number of problems on which we must come to an early decision so that we can, as I said earlier, formulate the objectives of our policy and decide the method by which those objectives are to be attained. *It is also clear that the action will have to be fairly comprehensive* , involving not only our defence strategy and state of preparations but also problem of internal security to deal with which we have not a moment to lose. We shall also have to deal with administrative and political problems in the weak spots along the frontier to which I have already referred.

It is of course, impossible to be exhaustive in setting out all these problems. *I am, however, giving below some of the problems which, in my opinion, require early solution and round which we have to build our administrative or military policies and measures to implement them* .

a) A military and intelligence appreciation of the Chinese threat to India both on the frontier and to internal security.

b) An examination of military position and such redisposition of our forces as might be necessary, particularly with the idea of guarding important routes or areas which are likely to be the subject of dispute.

c) An appraisement of the strength of our forces and, if necessary, reconsideration of our retrenchment plans for the Army in the light of the new threat.

d) *A long-term consideration of our defence needs. My own feeling is that, unless we assure our supplies of arms, ammunition and armour, we would be making our defence perpetually weak and we would not be able to stand up to the double threat of difficulties both from the west and north-west and north and north-east* .

e) *The question of China's entry into the UN. In view of the rebuff which China has given us and the method which it has followed in*

*dealing with Tibet, I am doubtful whether we can advocate its claim any longer. There would probably be a threat in the UN virtually to outlaw China, in view of its active participation in the Korean war. We must determine our attitude on this question also* .

f) The political and administrative steps which we should take to strengthen our northern and north-eastern frontier. This would include the whole of the border, ie. Nepal, Bhutan, Sikkim, Darjeeling and the tribal territory in Assam.

g) Measures of internal security in the border areas as well as the states flanking those areas such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Assam.

h) *Improvement of our communication, road, rail, air and wireless, in these areas and with the frontier outposts* .

i) *The future of our mission at Lhasa and the trade posts at Gyangtse and Yatung and the forces which we have in operation in Tibet to guard the trade routes* .

j) *The policy in regard to the McMahon Line* .

These are some of the questions which occur to my mind.

It is possible that a consideration of these matters may lead us into wider question of our relationship with China, Russia, America, Britain and Burma. This, however, would be of a general nature, though some might be basically very important, e.g., we might have to consider whether we should not enter into closer association with Burma in order to strengthen the latter in its dealings with China. I do not rule out the possibility that, before applying pressure on us, China might apply pressure on Burma. With Burma, the frontier is entirely undefined and the Chinese territorial claims are more substantial. In its present position, Burma might offer an easier problem to China, and therefore, might claim its first attention.

I suggest that we meet early to have a general discussion on these problems and decide on such steps as we might think to be immediately necessary and direct, quick examination of other problems with a view to taking early measures to deal with them.

Yours,

Vallabhbhai Patel.

Reportedly, there is nothing on record to show that Nehru acknowledged the above letter, and took up follow-up action as suggested by Patel. He perhaps thought that given his foreign-affairs "expertise" he didn't need any advice!!

In fact, like other documents inconvenient to the Dynasty, this letter of Sardar too was kept a secret and came to light only 18 years after it was written.

*Wrote Durga Das: "Not long afterwards, the situation across the northern border took a turn for the worse [1950], resulting in what was perhaps the last clash between Patel and Nehru in the Cabinet. Red China invaded Tibet and Nepal was in the grip of internal turmoil. It was well known that Patel and Prasad differed from Nehru on Tibet. They had urged him to ensure that Tibet continued as an independent buffer between China and India. Now their fears proved correct. Nehru felt upset because Peking had disregarded his counsel…"* {DD/304}

Wrote Durga Das further:

"At the last talk I had with him [Sardar Patel], a few days before his death in Bombay on 15th December 1950, Patel showed me a letter dated 7 th November 1950 he had written to Nehru [above letter]. (The letter was published by K.M. Munshi in Bhavan's Journal in its issue of 26th February 1967; because of its historic importance its text is given in Appendix II.) After I finished reading it he [Patel] said: '*I have loved Nehru but he has not reciprocated. I have been eating my heart out because I have not been able to make him see the dangers ahead. China wants to establish its hegemony over South-East Asia. We cannot shut our eyes to this because imperialism is appearing in a new garb. He does not realise that people work only when they have the employment motive or the profit motive* [that must have been in the context of Nehru's socialism]*. He is being misled by his courtiers. I have grave apprehensions about the future* .'"{DD/305}

### Nehru, China & Tibet

## Nehru's Meek, Delusional Note of 1950

In sharp contrast to the sparkling wisdom of Sardar Patel's letter to Nehru on China and Tibet, here are extracts from Nehru's meek, defeatist, fanciful, and delusional note{JN4} dated *18 November 1950* illustrating the self-certified foreign-affairs-expert and internationalist's lack of grasp and depth, and gross misconceptions on China and Tibet, though not as a response to Patel's letter (*author's comments below are in square brackets in italics, and are NOT part of Nehru's Note* ):

"…8. I think it may be taken for granted that China will take possession, in a political sense at least, of the whole of Tibet. There is no likelihood whatsoever of Tibet being able to resist this or stop it. It is equally unlikely that any foreign power can prevent it. We cannot do so… [*Make convenient assumptions so that one does not have to act. India didn't have to go on war on the side of Tibet, but it could surely have supported them diplomatically in world forums!* ]

"…10. *If world war comes* , then all kinds of difficult and intricate problems arise and each one of these problems will be inter-related with others. Even the question of defence of India assumes a different shape and cannot be isolated from other world factors. [*Nehru was prone to talk in terms of world war to skirt questions on what India ought to do* .] I think that it is exceedingly unlikely that we may have to face any real military invasion from the Chinese side, whether in peace or in war, in the foreseeable future. I base this conclusion on a consideration of various world factors. [*Nehru showed himself off as an expert in world affairs, and drew conclusions that suited his meek mental makeup* .] In peace, such an invasion would undoubtedly lead to world war… It is inconceivable that it should divert its forces and its strength across the inhospitable terrain of Tibet and undertake a wild adventure across the Himalayas. [*Since China won't do so, why bother—carry on as usual* .] Any such attempt will greatly weaken its capacity to meet its real enemies on other fronts. **Thus I rule out any major attack on India**

**by China** *.* I think these considerations should be borne in mind, because there is far too much loose talk about China attacking and overrunning India. If we lose our sense of perspective and world strategy [*Nehruvian "big words"—talk in terms of world strategy* !] and give way to unreasoning fears, then any policy that we might have is likely to fail…

"11. **While there is, in my opinion, practically no chance of a major attack on India by China,** there are certainly chances of gradual infiltration across our border and possibly of entering and taking possession of disputed territory, if there is obstruction to this happening. We must therefore take all necessary precautions to prevent this. But, again, we must differentiate between these precautions and those that might be necessary to meet a real attack.

"12. If we really feared an attack and had to make full provision for it, this would cast an intolerable burden on us, financial and otherwise, and it would weaken our general defence position. There are limits beyond which we cannot go, at least for some years [*But, did Nehru do the needful even in 12 long years prior to 1962* !], and a spreading out of our army on distant frontiers would be bad from every military or strategic point of view…

"14. The idea that communism inevitably means expansion and war, or to put it more precisely, that Chinese communism means inevitably an expansion towards India, is rather naïve. It may mean that in certain circumstances. Those circumstances would depend upon many factors, which I need not go into here…

"16. These arguments lead to the conclusion that while we should be prepared, to the best of our ability, for all contingencies, the real protection that we should seek is some kind of understanding of China. If we have not got that, then both our present and our future are imperilled and no distant power can save us. I think on the whole that China desires this too for obvious reasons. If this is so, then we should fashion our present policy accordingly… [*But, did Nehru reach, or even tried to reach, proper understanding with China? NO. Please see details in the next chapter on India-China war* .]

"17. We cannot save Tibet, as we should have liked to do, and our very attempts to save it might well bring greater trouble to it.

[*What a convenient assumption: if we attempt to save Tibet, it will sink into greater trouble! Hence, as a wise, kind and empathetic gesture, let us not help Tibet!! Alas, with Sardar Patel not in action (he was sick, and expired a month later), there was none to challenge the wild and convenient assumptions of Nehru* .] It would be unfair to Tibet for us to bring this trouble upon her without having the capacity to help her effectively…

"18. …We have said that [we] are not going to sponsor this appeal [*Tibet's appeal in the UN Security Council* ] , but if it comes up we shall state our viewpoint. [*Why should India have not sponsored Tibet's just appeal? Was that the way to treat our friendly and culturally close neighbour of centuries?* ] This viewpoint cannot be one of full support of the Tibetan appeal, because that goes far and claims full independence… But it will not take us or Tibet very far. It will only hasten the downfall of Tibet. No outsider will be able to help her and China, suspicious and apprehensive of these tactics, will make sure of much speedier and fuller possession of Tibet than she might otherwise have done. We shall thus not only fail in our endeavour but at the same time have really a hostile China on our doorstep… [*So, did Nehru manage to avert the hostile China on our doorstep? Was he able to avert war? Winston Churchill had rightly remarked: "An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile, hoping it will eat him last."* ]

"19. I think that in no event should we sponsor Tibet's appeal. I would personally think that it would be a good thing if that appeal is not heard in the Security Council or the General Assembly. [*Not only would Nehru not sponsor appeal of a neighbour (Tibet) in distress, he fondly hoped other countries too would spurn Tibet, and not sponsor its appeal! Why? Because, that would have forced India into taking a stand when what India preferred by way of its "wise" policy of the "internationalist and foreign-affairs expert" Nehru was to bury its head in sand* .] If it is considered there, there is bound to be a great deal of bitter speaking and accusation, which will worsen the situation as regards Tibet, as well as the possibility of widespread war, without helping it in the least. It must be remembered that neither the UK nor the USA, nor indeed any other power is particularly interested in Tibet or the future of that country. What they

are interested in is embarrassing China [*and, gentleman Nehru felt it was a sin to even embarrass China* ]. Our interest, on the other hand, is Tibet, and if we cannot serve that interest, we fail…

"20. Therefore, it will be better not to discuss Tibet's appeal in the UN. Suppose, however, that it comes up for discussion, in spite of our not wishing this, what then? I would suggest that our representative should state our case as moderately as possible and ask the Security Council or the Assembly to give expression to their desire that the Sino-Tibetan question should be settled peacefully… [*How could it be settled peacefully, unless China, the invader, withdrew? But, that demand Nehru never made* .]…"

### Nehru's Other Delusional Notes

Wrote Nehru in a note to the Secretary General, Ministry of External Affairs on 9 July 1949:

"Whatever may be the ultimate fate of Tibet in relation to China, I think there is practically no chance of any military danger to India arising from any possible change in Tibet. Geographically, this is very difficult and practically it would be a foolish adventure [*So, what happened in 1962?* ]. In India is to be influenced or an attempt made to bring pressure on it, Tibet is not the route for it."{AS/29}

Delude yourself and others that whatever happens in Tibet, India would remain unaffected—so why worry! Then, were the British foolish in taking care of the norther borders and Tibet? Please see the subchapter 'Independent India: Less Concerned than the British about Itself!' further down.

Nehru also wrote:

"I do not think there is any necessity at present for our Defence ministry, or any part of it, to consider possible military repercussions on the Indo-Tibetan frontier. The event is remote and may not arise at all. Any present thought being given to it will affect the balance we are trying to create in India. It may also not remain a secret and that would be unfortunate."{AS/29}

Contrast the above two delusional notes of Nehru with what Dalvi

wrote in his book '*Himalayan Blunder'* :

*"In October 1950 I was a student at the Defence services Staff College in Wellington, South India. Soon after the news of the Chinese entry in into Tibet reached us, the Commandant, General WDA (Joe) Lentaigne, strode into the main lecture hall, interrupted the lecturer and proceeded to denounce our leaders for their short-sightedness and inaction, in the face of Chinese action...he said that India's back door had been opened...He predicted that India would have to pay dearly for failure to act... His last prophetic remark was that some of the students present in the hall would be fighting the Chinese before retirement." {JPD/15}*

Nehru finally admitted: "We feel India has been ill-repaid for her diplomatic friendliness toward Peking... Difficult to say the Chinese have deliberately deceived us...We may have deceived ourselves..."{AS/38}
