# Sardar's Functioning

"*The Mahatma was the most respected, Jawaharlal Nehru the most loved and Subhas Bose the most longed-for. But in terms of the iron control he exercised over the largest political apparatus in the country and the grip he had on political currents and cross-currents in virtually every province in India, the power wielded by the Patidar from Karamsad [Sardar Patel], Gujarat, had no match. No nearmatch, either. Not by far* …"{URL3}

—Gopalkrishna Gandhi

"*Dressed in his Dhoti, Patel conjures up the vision of a Roman Emperor in his toga. There are, in fact, Roman qualities about this man—administrative talent, the capacity to take and sustain strong decisions, and a certain serenity which invariably accompanies real strength of character… In spite of all these preoccupations, Patel has a shrewd grasp of India's strategic position in the world at large… Off duty…he is indeed the embodiment of the gentle Hindu, full of benevolence and smiles* ."{ACJ/174}

—Allan Campbell-Johnson:

"Common talk among the members of the Indian Civil Service post-Independence used to be: '*If the dead body of the Sardar were stuffed and placed on a chair, he could still rule.* '"{BK/xi, xii}

—Balraj Krishna

# Sardar's Distinguishing Qualities

Sardar Patel was blessed with rare qualities of fortitude, integrity and iron determination. His exceptional success in handling of the integration of 548 Princely States practically demonstrated his farsightedness, his acumen, his tactful and innovative diplomacy, his skill in conflict resolution, and his quick decision-taking ability.

Patel never loaded or overloaded himself with files and paperwork and notings. What mattered for him were results and efficiency.

Patel was a very good judge of people, and he generally managed to select very competent people to work with him. He was a gifted team builder. Under his guidance, his various teams showed excellent results in the integration of the Princely States, in partition of assets between India and Pakistan, and in handling the difficult period of partition and after. Among the Indian leaders he was undoubtedly the greatest administrator, and showed his trend-setting ability, among other things, in quickly setting up an all-India Indian Administrative Services. For details, please check subchapters below.

With his stern, granite-like face, and penetrating hawkish eyes, Sardar Patel naturally invoked awe and respect. Patel's enormous success as a great administrator was thanks to his qualities of head and heart. He was sharp, was quick to grasp essentials, and had an iron-will to achieve what he wanted. He had a tremendous capacity to listen patiently and attentively. He was free and frank, and didn't mince words.

Patel was quick-witted, and had a great sense of humour. He used to regale Gandhi with his cracks when both were together in Yerwada Jail in 1932. Gandhi had written in a letter from Yerwada : "*Sardar Vallabhbhai is with me. His jokes make me laugh until I can laugh no more—not once, but several times every day* ."{BK/159} Indulging in sardonic humour, Sardar had commented to Gandhi in Yerwada on the Gandhi-Irwin Pact: "*You can compromise with anyone. How does that matter to you? After all a bania has no pride in his moustache and let's it hang down* !"{BK/163} Again in Yerwada, when a British doctor who had come to examine Gandhi ridiculed Indians for spending lakhs on feeding beggars, Sardar retorted: "*Yes. But a larger sum is spent on dacoits* ."{BK/164} With the doctor unable to catch the drift, Patel helpfully clarified: "*There are so many dacoits who have come from Britain! They are no better than looters.* " {BK/164}

#### Patel & IAS

It was generally believed that the ICS officers, who were regarded as protégés of the British, would be fittingly booted out after Independence, and would be replaced by patriotic persons. Nehru had himself once remarked of the Indian Civil Service (ICS): "I think it was Voltaire who defined the 'Holy Roman Empire' as something which was neither holy, nor Roman, nor an empire. Just as someone else once defined the Indian Civil Service, with which we are unfortunately still afflicted in this country, as *neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service.* "{KSMC/215}

Rather than adding another difficulty to the already difficult situation after partition, and lest there be further chaos, Patel accommodated Indian ICS officers, after obtaining from them a commitment to serve Free India with loyalty. However, Sardar did not go beyond a point in accommodation them. Mountbatten had sought compensation from India for loss of careers for ICS and IPS officers who chose or were asked to leave on transfer of power. Despite pressure, Patel put his foot down, and rejected the request outright! He was a tough man to deal with.

Sardar decided that the ICS would help manage the transfer of power, there being no alternative; and that Indian Administrative Service (IAS), a new civil service, would succeed the ICS. Convincing others about IAS was not easy. Provincial Chief Ministers were against all-India officers. They preferred provincial services officers, because being under them, they could have full control. That precisely Patel was against. He wanted all-India service officers who could take unbiased, independent decisions, without coming under the local provincial pressure. Realising that it were the British Civil Servants/ICS who had helped found and then run the British Empire, Patel wanted the new IAS to be partners in administering the country.

It must nevertheless be pointed out that thanks to the Congress not having worked out a large number of critical issues prior to independence when they had all the time in the world to do so, Sardar Patel had to perforce resort to ad hoc measures on

administration of such a vast and complex country, and do what he thought was best with regard to the ICS, IAS, IPS, and the like.

While in the then prevailing emergency situation it was the only prudent thing to do in the short term, as Sardar Patel did, the complete government babudom and the criminal-justice system (which have since become the biggest curse) should have been thoroughly reviewed, reformed and drastically restructured for the new, independent India. Unfortunately, Sardar died too early, and Nehru had no talent is such matters—indeed, he was comfortable with the rotten colonial legacy.

# Patel's Administration

Other qualities apart, Patel was a superb administrator. Realising that he would have to depend upon the administrators, and not politicians, to ensure the country runs properly, particularly in the chaotic times, he called a large group of senior civil servants in early 1947, had detailed discussions with them, and appealing to their patriotism, called upon them to dedicate themselves in the service of the nation. He let them know that they were all together as partners in efficient and just administration. It had a very positive effect. This and his subsequent interactions with the civil servants, his manner of administration and decision-taking, his standing by them enthused the civil servants to give their best. They also developed a high regard and respect for Patel.

Patel was a very good judge of people, and he generally managed to select very competent people to work with him. He then put full faith in people working under him, encouraged them, supported them, and exhorted them to always give their honest and considered opinion, without bothering whether or not Patel and others would like those opinions. This kept Patel supplied with correct information, palatable or otherwise; and provided him with honest opinions, options, and solutions.

This was in sharp contrast to Nehru, who preferred only sycophants, yes-men and hangers-on who would kowtow to him.

Patel never loaded or overloaded himself with files and

paperwork and notings. What mattered for him were results and efficiency. He didn't bury himself in files, and gave his notings. Secretaries came to him after thoroughly reading the files and preparing themselves, gave him oral briefings, and on that basis, after discussions, he gave his oral decisions that the secretaries noted. No paperwork for him. He had too much work to do, and too many decisions to take to indulge in files and papers. But, he had a photographic memory. He remembered all his oral decisions, and stood by his decisions, and backed up his secretaries when required.

Nehru, on the other hand, rather than taking quick decisions, or in lieu of taking decisions, loved paper-work and writing unnecessarily long and laborious notes and letters, more as a show-off, and less to get the work done. Nehru went to the ridiculous extent of even dictating telegraphic and mail replies, correcting and re-correcting their grammar and composition—something that a busy, competent leader ought to delegate to the army of babus reporting to them.

A very senior bureaucrat described an episode when he went to Patel for a very critical and major decision. The bureaucrat briefed him on all aspects. The Sardar gave his decision. Incredulous, the bureaucrat asked him if he wouldn't look at the papers. Sardar asked him matter-of-factly if the bureaucrat had missed out explaining or highlighting something that was in the files and papers. The bureaucrat replied in the negative. The Sardar then said there was no need for him to do what the bureaucrat was supposed to do. The bureaucrat was impressed by the Sardar's prompt, clear, and unambiguous decision, and what was more he was bold-out by the confidence reposed in him by the Sardar. Who wouldn't die to work for such a leader!

Sardar once affirmed: *"My Secretary can write a note opposed to my views. I have given that freedom to all my secretaries. I have told them, 'If you do not give your honest opinion for the fear that it will displease your Minister, then, please, you had better go. I will bring another Secretary.'" {BK/481}*

Once a bureaucrat, who had an unpleasant experience with another very senior politician, asked Patel in some context if he

really wanted his honest opinion. Patel erupted: "*Does Government pay you Rs 4000 a month for your dishonest opinions? It is for you to give an honest opinion; and it is for me to accept it or not* ." {BK/481}

Such remarks, conversations and episodes involving the Sardar quickly spread among the bureaucracy, who loved it. It motivated them to work honestly, diligently, and without fear. That bureaucrats like VP Menon, V Shankar and HM Patel achieved such wonderful results (details elsewhere in this book) was thanks to their association with Patel.

Wrote MKK Nair: "On April 27, 1948, Sardar Patel wrote to Nehru, 'I need hardly emphasize that an efficient, disciplined and contended Service, assured of its prospects as a result of diligent and honest work, is a sine qua non of sound administration under a democratic regime even more than under an authoritarian rule. The Service must be above the party and we should ensure that political considerations, either in recruitment or in discipline and control are reduced to the minimum, if not eliminated altogether.'{MKN}

Patel's enormous success as a great administrator was thanks to his qualities of head and heart. He was sharp, was quick to grasp essentials, and had an iron-will to achieve what he wanted. He had a tremendous capacity to listen patiently and attentively. He was witty and humorous, free and frank, and didn't mince words. He knew when to say "No!" But, he was discreet in his use of words. He excelled in his unerring judgement. He was just, polite, considerate, communicative, and accommodating. He gave respect, and received respect from all. He was a stern realist, meant business, and was decisive. His decisions never brooked delay. He used to be cool, composed, in control, and alert even in crisis.

Philip Mason, a British ICS, had commented that Patel was "*a natural administrator who did not seem to need experience* ."{BK/492} Things seemed to come to him instinctively and intuitively. He belongs to that rare class of administrators who are born, not made.

Wrote MKK Nair:

"VP called an attender and told him, 'Take this man outside.' Neshamani [Diwan of a Princely State] went out immediately. Neshamani then wrote a long letter of complaint to Sardar

Patel saying that V P Menon was a useless fellow and drunkard who in an inebriated state had insulted him and sent him out of his room. When this reached Sardar Patel, VP had not reached back in Delhi. Patel called his Private Secretary, V Shankar, ICS and asked him, 'Does VP have a habit of consuming liquor?' 'Yes' Shankar told him. 'What does he usually drink?' was what Patel wanted to know and Shankar told him, 'He drinks only Scotch Whisky.' 'Then please advise all Secretaries to drink Scotch Whisky' Patel told him. This became an amusing topic of discussion at high-level comradeship meetings in Delhi."{MKN}

# Nehru, a Poor Administrator—in Sharp Contrast

A few instances are already given above, including that on paperwork. This is what KF Rustamji, who had worked with Nehru, had to say:

"No big decision could be taken in India by anyone, except Nehru. He kept about and below him men who would always turn to him for decisions, or who, if they took decisions would soon be told that they were wrong… How did this work in practice? It meant that on every major problem when there was a doubt about government policy, that doubt would be removed by the PM… There were good, clever men, advisers in the government, who were able to read the PM's mind, or make an accurate forecast of the way he would think. But these men did not exercise their own critical judgement. They merely anticipated a decision which could be easily done. If it could not be easily anticipated, they awaited the Oracle's pronouncement… Modern government is such a complex affair that if a policy is uncertain, those who function at a distance (like ambassadors and delegates to the UN) or lower below (like Under Secretaries) are constantly kept guessing."{Rust/72}

### Rustamji also wrote:

"The one test which Nehru applied to men whom he took into the inner circle was loyalty to him. It did not matter if a man had no mind of his own. He must, however, have enough

intelligence to avoid irritation. He should be able to understand what the PM said, and if he asked questions, he should do so intelligently so that an opening may be provided for JN to amplify his points for another half an hour or so… He must put all his faith in Nehru, believe in Nehru, admire and adore Nehru, and say worshipful things now and again which could be brushed aside with gratified indifference…"{Rust/194}

Rajaji wrote in Swarajya of 21.10.1961: "Does [Nehru] not realise that a fine cadre of officials have now been made into spineless flatterers and partisans?... I see Chief Ministers, finance and food ministers going about extorting money for the party without fear or shame… I happen to remember a time when such things could not be thought of…"{RG3/383}

# Sardar, Constitution and Minorities

As Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Minorities set up by the Constituent Assembly, Sardar Patel tactfully outmanoeuvred leftout-in-India Muslim Leaguers and Jinnah's agents, and even Maulana Azad, who were trying to ensure separate electorates and reservation of seats for the Muslims. Patel was determined to ensure that the seeds of separation that had been sown by the British by way of separate Muslim electorates and seats were not re-sown in the new Constitution being made. Patel's triumph in this respect was hailed by Nehru as a "*historic turn in our destiny* ".

Patel set in motion the critical policies in the Constituent Assembly through his confidants like GB Pant and KM Munshi. He was discreet and diplomatic, and avoided imposing his will. Yet, he ensured through his deft manoeuvres that nothing harmful, like the separate Minority electorates, became part of the Constitution. Several leading Muslim leaders had even demanded provision in the Constitution for appointment of Muslim Qazis to administer *Sharia Laws* !

Sardar: Non-Dynastic & Non-Nepotistic, unlike Nehru

Sardar was against anyone, including his kin, using his name to gain favour or get unfair advantage.

Sardar Patel had gone to the extent of telling his son and grandson, when they visited him [Sardar] after he suffered a heartattack in Delhi: "*As long as I am in this chair, don't visit Delhi, unless I am unwell and you have to see me...All sorts of people will contact you. Take care* ."{RG/473}

Unlike Indira Gandhi, Maniben Patel, Sardar's daughter, was a freedom fighter, and underwent several jail terms. Yet Sardar Patel never promoted her post-independence. Even Sardar's son Dahyabhai was a freedom fighter and was jailed for two years during the Quit India Movement, but Sardar never promoted him.

Here are extracts from a report dated 18 March 2009 in *The Times of India* by Prashant Rupera:

"As the country gears up for yet another Lok Sabha polls, TOI traced the family members of Sardar Patel, who are still lying low to keep the promise that the Iron Man had taken to abstain from power.

"Very few know that Iron Man's youngest grandson is still alive and settled in Vadodara after a stint in academia at the US. Sardar's family consisted of wife Zaverba, son Dahyabhai and daughter Maniben. While Maniben remained unmarried till her death in 1993, Dahyabhai had two sons Bipin and Gautam. Bipin, who had no children, passed away in January 2004, and the only one to carry forward Sardar's bloodline is 69 year-old Gautam, whose son Kedar is settled in the US.

"'We have abstained from sharing any views on Sardar Patel or his life, as we would fall into the trap of politics of one or the other party,' Gautam's wife Nandini told TOI. Her husband preferred to join Stanford University, as they were nourished with an ideology, which asked them not to misuse Sardar's name and his fame of being the most powerful man in independent India…

"It is not that politicians have not approached the family. 'There have been times when different people approached us for different purposes. We have received requests to take part in some programmes on Sardar's life. But we refused, as even Sardarsaheb wanted so,' said 70-year-old Bhupendrabhai Patel, son of Sardar's nephew Manu. Patel lives with his three brothers in Vidyanagar and owns a music shop…"

Compare the above with how Nehru pulled out all the stops to promote Indira Gandhi.

Durga Das writes in his book that in 1957 in his weekly column in Hindustan Times he wrote Nehru was building up his daughter for succession. He says he had checked with Maulana Azad before writing the column, and Azad had said he too had independently reached the same conclusion. Even Govind Ballabh Pant had the same opinion. Later, when Nehru remonstrated with Durga Das on the column, to mollify Nehru, Durga Das assured him that what he had written would bring good publicity to Indira and would stand her in good stead—at which Nehru felt happy and smiled.{DD/370}

Although Indira Gandhi had done little work for the Congress, she was made a member of the Congress Working Committee—entry directly from the top, rather than rising from the bottom. There were many seniors in the Congress who felt unhappy and commented, "We are not dead yet." She was then made President of the Congress, to the astonishment of all, after an intense behind the scenes drama, managed through others by Nehru. Nehru had also started developing her as a public figure, which included giving her exposure to foreign dignitaries and guests. Kamraj Plan was also used to clear the way for Indira from the seniors. Acharya Kripalani believed that the evils in the country emanated from the top and that Nehru was the pace-setter in abusing patronage and power. {DD/371}

Wrote Rajmohan Gandhi: "Suddenly, at this juncture, Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal's daughter, was named party president. Her talents were yet a secret, and she had no experience of party work. Several of Nehru's colleagues were offended by the choice but said nothing. C.R. [Rajaji] was outraged."{RG3/373}

Wrote Kuldip Nayar:

"This was where I first heard that Congress President V.N. Dhebar was resigning and Indira Gandhi was taking over. Pant had supported Nehru at Vinoba's ashram but not at the CWC when Indira Gandhi was nominated as the party president. He was careful not to oppose Nehru's daughter directly but argued that her frail health would come in the way of the extensive travels the Congress president was required to undertake. Raising his voice, Nehru told Pant that 'she was healthier than both of us' and could put in longer hours of work. The subsequent discussions, as I noted, were to fix the date on which she would assume charge. This was the first time that dynastic politics came to the fore, and the Congress since then has been following the practice of invariably having a member of Nehru family at the helm of affairs...Left to Nehru, he would have liked Indira to succeed him as prime minister, but too many Congress leaders, with a long stint of sacrifice and struggle for the country's freedom, were still on the scene at the time."{KN}

One may say that Nehru did not make Indira Gandhi the PM. But, he was working towards it. However, before he could fulfil his mission he passed away. Though he had done the ground work given the necessary visibility to her. Lal Bahadur *Shastri* had himself told that "*in Panditji's mind is his daughter* ".

Writes Kuldip Nayar: "I ventured to ask Shastri one day: 'Who do you think Nehru has in mind as his successor?' 'Unke dil main to unki saputri hai [In his heart is his daughter],' said Shastri... Nijalingappa said he was pretty sure that Nehru had his daughter in mind as his successor. In his diary, he wrote on 15 July 1969 that Nehru 'was always grooming her for the prime-ministership obviously and patently'."{KN}

Apart from the above dynastic streak vis-à-vis Indira, Nehru had a nepotistic streak. During the Nehruvian era of 1947–64 there were many Pandits, Saprus, Kauls, Katjus, Dhars, Nehrus, and their kins in various government posts. Wrote Neville Maxwell: "An official (non-Kashmiri, non-Brahmin) who worked closely with Nehru for a time wrote that enemies of the Prime minister used to say that his

search for talent and gift for talent spotting was limited to those around him and particularly to Kashmiris, and amongst them, those who were in one way or another connected with the Nehru family…"{Max}

# No Hypocrisy in Money Matters

People like Nehru and Gandhi understood too well the importance of money to run an organisation like the Congress, and to win elections. Yet, they shied away from the responsibility of garnering funds lest their image should get sullied.

This is from a blog-post of Swapan Dasgupta: '"*I have heard* ", Nehru told Ghosh [Atulya Ghosh: West Bengal Congress supremo in the early 1960s] accusingly, "*that you are a bit too friendly with Calcutta's Marwari businessmen* ." Never inclined to kowtow to someone he regarded as a poseur, Ghosh's reply was characteristically blunt: "*What you have heard is right. Our party needs money, not merely for Bengal but for UP and Bihar too. Who do you think funds us? Without that money you wouldn't be wearing that rose on your lapel* ." Nehru was taken aback by this insolence and complained to his old friend Dr BC Roy who was chief minister of West Bengal. Dr Roy laughed it off but delighted in repeating the story to others.'{SDG}

Here is a description of Sardar Patel's attitude, in sharp contrast. Gandhi had hang-ups on collection of money for the 1946 elections. However, realising the critical importance of funds, Vallabhbhai Patel took on the responsibility, and did the needful. He wrote to Gandhi later: "*I did the work as I felt it was unavoidable. We would have all been blamed if it had not been done* ."{RG2/L-5987} GD Birla was told by Gandhi: "*I do not like Sardar collecting money from businessmen* ." When Birla conveyed those remarks to Patel, he retorted: "*That is not his [Gandhi's] concern. Gandhi is a Mahatma. I am not. I have to do the job* ."{RG2/L-5994}

#### Democrat Patel vs. Autocrat Nehru

It was unfortunate that Nehru used to be autocratic and wanted all power to himself, even though he generally made poor decisions, as the results of his decisions showed, and as the history proved.

In sharp contrast, even though Patel generally made prompt, timely and correct decisions, he tended to be democratic. Patel could afford to be autocratic and dictatorial, and the nation could afford it, given the correctness and quality of his decisions, yet he remained democratic; while the nation could not really afford the generally wrong decisions that Nehru took, yet Nehru remained autocratic.

*Had Nehru been democratic, open, and transparent, hopefully many of his potential mistakes would have been corrected through democratic discussions in the Cabinet.* Even as major and as disastrous a decision as that on Kashmir, Nehru took himself without taking the Cabinet, or even Patel, into confidence—the country suffered, and is still suffering!

### Tandon's Election

The "great democrat" Nehru, who had most undemocratically become the first Prime Minister even when none voted for him (please see details earlier), manoeuvred for a complete domination over the party in 1950, just before Patel's demise, by having a Congress President of his choice elected.

Nehru unilaterally declared the socialist JB Kripalani as the candidate. Patel gave full support to Purushottam Das Tandon for the presidentship. Nehru, the pseudo-secular, had his objections to the selection of Tandon. The objections didn't really make sense, like Tandon attending a *Refugees' Conference* , and so on. Nehru threatened to resign if Tandon was elected President. Despite the threat, Tandon won with 1306 votes against Kripalani's 1092. *Nehru, the power-hungry person, of course, didn't resign.* On the next day of the election results, when Rajaji came to meet Patel, Patel asked him jocularly: "*Have you brought Jawaharlal's resignation?* " {RG2/L-9007}

### Nehru: Both PM & Party President

*Patel's death was the beginning of the end of internal democracy in the Congress* .

To gain Nehru's favour, sycophancy began in high gear; and then it got established as the main trait of the Nehru-Dynasty-led Congress, becoming worse with each generation. Sycophants in the CWC left it to Nehru, and not the party, to select candidates for the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, increasing Nehru's clout many-fold. Nehru gradually outmanoeuvred Tandon, and forced his resignation from the presidentship of the party.

Although already having critical responsibilities to fulfil as a Prime Minister, with the additional charge of the External Affairs, "democratic" Nehru took on the additional job as president of the party in 1951, by manipulating his elevation, so as to become all powerful. The normal practice in the Congress was to elect a new president each year, but ignoring it, Nehru kept getting himself reelected, and remained president for a continuous term of four years.

### John Mathai, Nehru & Patel

John Mathai (1886–1959) was an economist who served as India's first Railway Minister and subsequently as India's Finance Minister between 1949 and 1951. Incidentally, Verghese Kurien of Amul fame was his nephew; while his son, Ravi Mathai, was the Founder Director of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

Mathai was made to resign by Nehru following his objection to the increasing power of the Planning Commission. In a press statement upon his resignation, Mathai said, inter alia: "I consider the Planning Commission not merely ill-timed but in its working and general set-up ill-conceived. The Planning Commission was tending to become a parallel cabinet… it would weaken the authority of the Finance Ministry and gradually reduce the Cabinet to practically a registering authority… The Planning Commission was totally unnecessary and in fact hardly qualified for its work… there was a general tendency amongst the various Ministries to disregard the authority of the Standing Finance Committee and that some of the greatest offenders were the Ministers directly under the control of the Prime

Minister. When departures from accepted practice were approved by the Prime Minister, it has a demoralizing effect on other departments of Government."

Apart from the above, Mathai was particularly distressed about the manner in which Pandit Nehru dealt with issues of governance. Whenever someone pointed out mistakes of Nehru, he would either blame others or arrogantly brush them aside.

Initially prejudiced against Sardar Patel, and being pro-Nehru, Mathai soon discovered Nehru's "feet of clay" and remarked:

"…Under Nehru the Cabinet had never functioned, and all decisions were taken privately by the Prime Minister and the individual Minister concerned. Even when a decision was endorsed in the Cabinet, the Prime Minister went back on it and reversed the decision… The only time when the Indian Cabinet really functioned was when Nehru was away in Washington for a few weeks towards the end of October 1948 and when Sardar Patel was acting as Prime Minister. For the first time the cabinet functioned with joint responsibility; and the acting Prime Minister conducted meetings as the British Prime Minister would have."{BK/505}
