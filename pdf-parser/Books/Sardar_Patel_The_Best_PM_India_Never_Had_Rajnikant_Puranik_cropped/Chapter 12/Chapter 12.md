# Sardar vs. Nehruvian "Secularism"

### Nehru's Pseudo-Secular Position

Secular doctrine mandates separation of the state from religion. It is the principle of the separation of government institutions and government functionaries mandated to represent the state from religious institutions, religious authorities, and religious functionaries. It's a belief that religion should not play a role in the government. A secular state is neutral in the matters of different religious beliefs.

A secular state can't impose religious beliefs and practices upon people. The decisions and acts of a secular state should not be influenced by religious beliefs and/or practices. Secularism is not anti-religion, it is religion-neutral.

Nehru blatantly misused "secularism" for minority-appeasement and vote-bank politics.

Curiously, both the Muslim League and the Jamait-ul-Ulema could team with, and even fight elections on the Congress tickets that wasn't communal, as per Nehru's self-serving definition of 'secularism'. Were communal and 'non-secular' only those who dared to safeguard Hindu interests? Nehru took care not to define the terms like 'secularism' and 'communalism' and clarify what was meant by a secular state, for that would have robbed him of the flexibility in exploiting them politically. As his tenure hurtled towards disaster, these terms became more and more useful in his vote-bank politics, and as a diversionary discourse.

Wrote Durga Das: "But [Maulana] Azad [who was close to Nehru] revised his opinion of Nehru in the last two years of his life. Indeed, he went to the extent of expressing regret for being unfair to Patel and asserting that he was sure that the country would have been better off if Patel had been Prime Minister. What motivated this

change? Towards the end of his life, Azad realised that the best protection for the Muslims was the goodwill of the Hindus and a strong government. He told me he had come to the conclusion that Nehru's policies had weakened the administration and that his economic theories had failed to improve the living conditions of the people, especially the Muslims."{DD/377-8}

In the Ajmer communal riots soon after independence, notwithstanding the mischief of the Muslims, Nehru intervened through his private secretary HVR Iyengar to mollycoddle violent Muslims, and ensured that as many Hindus (even if innocent) as Muslims were arrested. On the other hand, Patel stood firmly with the Chief Secretary of the State, Shankar Prasad, and opposed Nehru's unjust intervention.

Nehru turned a blind eye to illegal and rampant proselytization by the Christian missionaries that adversely affected national interests. This was particularly so in the Northeast where Nehru went by the advice of the Christian missionaries. The net effect was the secessionist movements in the North-eastern states.

Nehru insisted that Urdu was the language of the people of Delhi, and should accordingly be given official recognition. When the Home Minister Pant told him that the statistics showed only 6% of the Delhiwalas had claimed Urdu as their language, Nehru tried to rubbish the statistics, though he didn't press further with his crazy idea.

Nehru was also in favour of Persian-Arabic script in which Urdu is written, rather than Devanagari script in which Hindi and Sanskrit are written.

The Constituent Assembly's pledge of building one nation with one citizenship became a victim of Nehru's minority-majority syndrome. All those who opposed him were disparaged, labelled non-secular and communal, and weeded out. Gradually, a coterie around Nehru vigorously spread his defective pseudo-secular, anti-Hindu, poverty-perpetuating and misery-multiplying socialistic claptrap, and discredited and sidelined all those who refused to toe Nehru's line. Leaders who differed exited, and leaders who remained became parrots, bereft of individuality and fresh ideas. Commented

## Ambedkar on Appeasement

Wrote Ambedkar{Amb3} :

"…He [Gandhi] has never called the Muslims to account even when they have been guilty of gross crimes against Hindus…

"It is a notorious fact that many prominent Hindus who had offended the religious susceptibilities of the Muslims either by their writings or by their part in the Shuddhi movement have been murdered by some fanatic Musalmans. First to suffer was Swami Shraddhanand, who was shot by Abdul Rashid on 23rd December 1926 when he was lying in his sick bed. This was followed by the murder of Lala Nanakchand, a prominent Arya Samajist of Delhi… Nathuramal Sharma was murdered by Abdul Qayum in September 1934. It was an act of great daring. For Sharma was stabbed to death in the Court of the Judicial Commissioner of Sind where he was seated awaiting the hearing of his appeal against his conviction under Section 195, I. P. C., for the publication of a pamphlet on the history of Islam. Khanna, the Secretary of the Hindu Sabha, was severely assaulted in 1938 by the Mahomedans after the Session of the Hindu Maha Sabha held in Ahmedabad and very narrowly escaped death…

"This is, of course, a very short list and could be easily expanded. But whether the number of prominent Hindus killed by fanatic Muslims is large or small matters little. What matters is the attitude of those who count, towards these murderers. The murderers paid the penalty of law where law is enforced. The leading Moslems, however, never condemned these criminals. On the contrary, they were hailed as religious martyrs and agitation was carried on for clemency being shown to them. As an illustration of this attitude, one may refer to Mr. Barkat Alli, a Barrister of Lahore, who argued the appeal of Abdul Qayum. He went to the length of saying that Qayum was not guilty of murder of Nathuramal because his act was

justifiable by the law of the Koran. This attitude of the Moslems is quite understandable. What is not understandable is the attitude of Mr. Gandhi…

"Mr. Gandhi has been very punctilious in the matter of condemning any and every act of violence and has forced the Congress, much against its will to condemn it. But Mr. Gandhi has never protested against such murders. Not only have the Musalmans not condemned these outrages but even Mr. Gandhi has never called upon the leading Muslims to condemn them. He has kept silent over them. Such an attitude can be explained only on the ground that Mr. Gandhi was anxious to preserve Hindu-Moslem unity and did not mind the murders of a few Hindus, if it could be achieved by sacrificing their lives…

"This attitude to excuse the Muslims any wrong, lest it should injure the cause of unity, is well illustrated by what Mr. Gandhi had to say in the matter of the Mopla [*Moplah* ] riots.

"The following instances of Muslim intransigence, over which Mr. Gandhi kept mum are recorded by Swami Shraddhanand…: 'As regards the removal of untouchability it has been authoritatively ruled several times that it is the duty of Hindus to expiate for their past sins and non-Hindus should have nothing to do with it. But the Mahomedan and the Christian Congressmen have openly revolted against the dictum of Mr. Gandhi at Vaikorn and other places. Even such an unbiased leader as Mr. Yakub Hassan, presiding over a meeting called to present an address to me at Madras, openly enjoined upon Musalmans the duty of converting all the untouchables in India to Islam.' But Mr. Gandhi said nothing by way of remonstrance either to the Muslims or to the Christians…"

# Patel's Just and Correct Position

Before Independence.

Patel was against the Muslim Minority, represented by Jinnah, the Muslim League, and others, deviously and unjustly trying to extract in a democratic setup a position for itself equal to or higher than the

Hindu Majority, with the active support and encouragement of the British, who had their own vested interest. It amounted to placing a veto in their hands.

Although Patel was among the closest colleagues of Gandhi, he drastically differed from Gandhi on the Muslim question. Patel was most certainly not communal, but he was against unjustified appeasement of Muslims. He also felt that Gandhi-Nehru appeasement of Muslims would adversely affect freedom struggle, rather than taking it forward—and, it indeed turned out that way.

#### After Independence.

Thanks to the poison spread by Jinnah, the Muslim League and other Muslim leaders, many Muslims who had stayed back in India still looked up to Pakistan as their real home and nation, continued with or adopted a hostile attitude towards the majority community, supported Pakistan on Kashmir rather than India, kept up demands similar to what had brought about the partition by the Muslim League (reservation of seats), and indulged in activities not expected of a citizen of democratic India.

Patel wanted the Muslims who had stayed back to change their attitude. He wanted Hindus and Muslims to forgive and forget, and to live as equal citizens of India in harmony.

Dr Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari (1880–1936), a former president of the Indian National Congress and also the Muslim League, a foundermember of the Jamia Millia Islamia University and its Chancellor between 1928 and 1936, had said: "The true safeguard of a minority is the goodwill of the majority." Rafiq Zararia had said later: "The Indian Muslims must cultivate the Hindus… remove the cobwebs of religious prejudices and historical distortions which have bedevilled their relations with the Hindus."

Similarly, Patel desired harmony between Hindus and Muslims, not by giving in to the unreasonable demands of the Muslims, or by favouring them at the expense of the majority community, like Nehru and Gandhi were prone to do, but by treating them on par as equal citizens, with neither any favour, nor with any prejudice against.

Even though Patel differed from Gandhi, Nehru, Maulana Azad

and others in his approach to the question of Minorities, he was totally non-communal. Patel's approach was that of a no-nonsense, fair, judicious, and unbiased administrator, who didn't believe in favouring either Hindus or Muslims just to get popular, or be regarded as a "great secular" or a "Mahatma".

The true test of that is what a person actually does. And Patel's actions speak for themselves. Patel was Home Minister, and his favourite IG of Police was a Muslim. Despite what Nizam of Hyderabad and Nawab of Bhopal did against India, once they came around, Patel didn't treat them as enemies, and took revenge, but was, instead, most fair to them, and both of them effusively praised Patel for his generosity and excellent treatment. Similarly, in the matter of partition of assets between India and Pakistan, the Pakistani team was full of praise for him—please see details in the subchapter on partition of assets.

What is worth noting is that socialists and seculars like Jayaprakash Narayan, who used to be pro-Nehru and anti-Patel, started saying things similar to what Patel had been saying, albeit a decade or two after independence when they began to get disenchanted with Nehruvian politics.

## Extracts of Patel's Forthright Speeches

There had been unsettling rabble-rousing and provocative speeches during the Mussalman-e-Hind Lucknow Conference attended by thousands of Muslims (and by Maulana Azad too) in December 1947—so soon after the ordeal of partition. Could Hindus have called such a conference in Pakistan, and spoken thus? Certainly not. But, in Gandhi-Nehru era of appeasement, even after the blow of partition, Muslim leaders could take liberties!

Patel didn't believe in remaining a mute spectator to such things, like Gandhi and Nehru, and soon after the above Conference, he spoke thus in Lucknow {RG/461} :

"…Muslim Leaguers call me their greatest enemy. Formerly they used to call Mahatma Gandhi their Enemy Number One. Now they think Gandhi is their friend, and have substituted me in his place… I am a true friend of the Muslims... I believe in plain-speaking. I do not know how to mince matters. I want to

tell you frankly that mere declarations of loyalty to the Indian Union will not help you at this critical juncture. You must give practical proof of your declarations. I ask you why you do not unequivocally denounce Pakistan for attacking Indian territory... Is it not your duty to condemn all acts of aggression against India?...

"In the recent All-India Muslim Conference, why did you not open your mouth on Kashmir?... In the Constituent Assembly one of the Lucknow Muslim Leaguers pleaded for separate electorates and reservation of seats. I had to open my mouth and say that he could not have it both ways. Now he is in Pakistan… Those who want to go to Pakistan can go there and live in peace. Let us live here in peace to work for ourselves… I want to say a word as a friend of the Muslims and it is the duty of a good friend to speak frankly: It is your duty now to sail in the same boat [with Hindus/Others] and sink or swim together. I want to tell you clearly that you cannot ride on two horses. You select one horse, whichever you like best."{RG/461}

In the Constituent Assembly, Patel had stated: "It is up to the majority community, by its generosity, to create a sense of confidence in the minorities… If the minorities have honestly come to the conclusion that, in the changed conditions of the country, it is in the interest of all to lay down real and genuine foundations of a secular State, then nothing is better for the minorities than to trust the good sense and sense of fairness of the majority and to place confidence in then… In the long run it would be in the interest of all to forget that there is anything like majority or minority in this country, and that in India there is only one community."{BNS/212}
