# Sardar & the Integration of

## the Princely States

## Princely States: An Overview

Lord Richard Wellesley, who was the British Governor-General during 1798–1805, introduced the doctrine of subsidiary alliance that gradually led to a large number of Indian Princely States becoming only nominally sovereign by surrendering to the British under a *Paramountcy Agreement* what really make a state sovereign: Communications, Defence, and Foreign Policy. Under the terms of the paramountcy the troops of the British Army were permanently stationed within their territories, and their maintenance was heavily subsidised by the Princely States! That is, the Princely States paid the British for keeping the Princely States under the British military control!! The Subsidiary Alliance system proved extremely advantageous to the British, as it enabled them to maintain a large army at the cost of the Indian states. Such terms led to disbandment of the soldiers of the Princely States, depriving them of their hereditary livelihood, spreading unemployment, poverty and misery. The first such Subsidiary Treaty was signed with the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1798. *There were 562 such Princely States at the time of independence in 1947, covering 40% of the area of India* .

The Princely States had played a valuable role for the British in helping them triumph in the First War of Independence of 1857, also called the 1857-Mutiny. Many of the rulers of the Princely States aided the British either directly or indirectly to limit and suppress the revolt. While several Princely States, notably Nepal, Hyderabad and Patiala, provided military aid to the East India Company; many helped limit the uprising through their passive loyalty to the British.

The British Professor LF Rushbrook Williams called the Princely States "*a network of friendly fortresses in debatable territory* ". Wrote Governor-General Lord Canning: "The safety of our rule is increased, not diminished, by the maintenance of Native Chiefs."

A princely state was a nominally-sovereign or semi-sovereign monarchy under a local, regional ruler in a subsidiary alliance with the British Raj. It was not directly governed by the British. It was governed by a local ruler under an indirect British rule. They were subject to the paramountcy of the British Crown. Similar arrangements existed under the British rule in Africa, Malaya, and the Arabian Peninsula.

Prior to Independence, about 60% of the area of the undivided India, with 75% of the population—about 300 million out of a total of 400 million—was directly controlled by the British (hence called British India) through its representative designated as the Viceroy.

The remaining 40% of the area, with 25% of the population about 100 million—was ruled by the princes: Maharajas, Rajas, Nawabs, Nizam, and so on.

There were 562 such Princely States. The largest of these was J&K—Jammu & Kashmir—followed by Hyderabad, each of which was almost as big as the mainland Britain.

327 or 58% of these 562 Princely States were very small states, with an average area of about 20 square miles, average population of about 3000, and average annual revenue of about 22,000 rupees. 222 or about 40% of the 562 states, covering an area of about 22,000 square miles, were in just one region in Saurashtra in Gujarat state—Kathiawar, a peninsular region bounded on the north by the wetland of the Rann of Kutch, on the northwest by the Gulf of Kutch, on the west and south by the Arabian Sea, and on the southeast and east by the Gulf of Khambhat. There were 27 princely states in Orissa and 14 in Chhattisgarh, the biggest being Mayurbhanj and Bastar respectively.

Roughly a quarter of the total had the status of a 'salute state'. Salute state was one whose ruler was honoured by receiving 9 to 21 gun salutes, depending upon its status, on ceremonial occasions. Rulers entitled to 11 gun salutes and above received the style of

Highness. Being the 'Faithful Ally of the British Empire' (a title bestowed on him by the Raj for being most dog-like), the Nizam of Hyderabad was honoured with an exalted style by the British: 'Exalted Highness'. The premier 21-gun salute states were Hyderabad and Jammu & Kashmir.

In the Chamber of Princes—an advisory body constituted under the GoI Act 1919—only 109 States were represented directly, 127 were allowed 12 seats, and the remaining 326 were considered too small to be represented.

Rulers of all the princely states owed allegiance to the British Crown, and acknowledged British *paramountcy* through individual treaties. The States were allowed governance in internal matters such as law and order, civil liberties, health, education and economic development, while the British took care of the defence, foreign policy and communications. Their citizens were not British subjects. The British stationed company troops in the capital of each state under the control of a *British Resident* . The troops, while "protecting" the state, were also keeping princes in line—a service for which they had to pay the British! The *British Resident* could always have his way—if he so chose.

#### Pathetic Princes & their Princely States

To know about the Princes, Maharajas and Maharanis it is worth reading the books 'Maharaja' and 'Maharani' by Diwan Jarmani Dass.{JD}{JD2} Most of them were autocrats, tyrants, spendthrifts, and shameless exploiters. The All-India States Peoples' Conference was an organisation that represented the 100 million subjects of the Princely States—it regarded many of the princes as tyrants.

As long as the Princely States remained loyal to the British, and did not commit an intolerably outrageous act from the British political angle, they were left alone by the British, even if they engaged in gross exploitation of their subjects, tyranny, shameless profligacy, or mad acts like grand marriages of dogs and bitches like the Nawab of Junagadh (please see details under the subchapter 'Sardar, Junagadh and the Crazy Nawab') used to engage in.

Wrote MJ Akbar: "By the twentieth century many of its [of Princely

Order/States] scions were either perverts or caricatures, and very often both… their only apparent interests were the quality of their horses, the number of their women and the potency of their aphrodisiacs. The British were most content with this state of affairs [It meant the British power was safe and would remain unchallenged.]."{Akb/169}

Sardar's personal views on the princely order were more critical than Nehru:

*"Today's princes are the product of Rajkumar College! They are like rotten fruit! The Princes are sent there so as to turn them out as incompetent, worthless human beings, deprived of the power of independent thinking, and whose manners and morals are of the depraved…" {Shod2}*

Back in the 1920s and 1930s, Sardar Patel had commented on various occasions:{BK/296-7}

"The condition of the Indian [Princely] States is both disorderly and pitiable. Nowhere in the world will one find such strange institutions. Even when they are proclaimed as independent kingdoms, there are no limits to their slavery. On behalf of the British Empire there is a chowkidar in the person of the Resident [a British officer] to superintend over the Princes. It is considered a matter of wisdom to administer the State in accordance with his wishes. For the Princes to claim the Empire's friendship is sheer nonsense, like friendship between a lion and a jackal!" Declaring that "the whole of India is one country", Patel told the Princes that "they will be sadly mistaken if they can rest content with trumpeting their loyalty to the Empire. The time will come when what they do not do on advice, they will have to do in their hour of defeat." On another occasion, addressing a gathering, Patel remarked: "We in British India are no doubt slaves. But, you living in the [Princely] States are doubly slaves. You are slaves of a slave! That's why your condition is worse."{BK/296-7}

Most of the princes didn't want the British to leave. What otherwise would happen to their autocracy, power, and profligacy? No wonder HH Ali Nawaz Khan, the Mir of Khairpur, had said: " *The interests of the Indian native rulers are identical with those of the*

*British government. They believe if the present status is altered it will injure their interests* ."{Tunz/217}

Dividing India into Hundreds of Pieces

How to continue the Raj? Keep India as divided as possible. Are Hindus and Muslims trying to come together politically to unseat the British? Is the Congress established in 1885 trying to forge a common platform of Hindus and Muslims? Recognise there are three groups: Hindus, Muslims and the British. Why allow Hindus + Muslims? If it can't be Hindus + British, why not try for British + Muslims? The seeds of that (British + Muslims) were sown through the Act of 1892. The same was actively promoted by the Governor General and the Viceroy of India Lord Curzon from 1899 to 1905 (division of Bengal), and after him by Lord Minto (foundation of the Muslim League) between 1905 and 1910.

Among other major divisions manipulated by the British were (a)attempt to unhinge the untouchables or dalits from the Hindu mainstream; and (b)promotion of the Aryan-Dravidian fiction to divide the North from South, and give impetus to the Christian Missionaries for proselytization leveraging on the false propaganda.

Wrote Durga Das: "The policy of divide and rule was given a new dimension because while Muslim separatism could take care of the situation in the Indo-Gangetic plain, the regions below the Vindhyas had to be tackled differently. Here a beginning was made with the sponsoring of a non-Brahmin movement. This was followed by a subtle attempt to drive a wedge between the Dravidian and the Aryan. Their culture, it was claimed on the basis of zealous research on the part of a Christian missionary, were distinct and apart; Tamil was an older language than Sanskrit and its literature far richer."{DD/59}

To Lord Chelmsford, who was the Viceroy of India from 1916 to 1921, goes the credit of fortifying yet another division in India in the face of the nationalist upsurge—those of the Princely States. He promoted the *Chamber of Princes* as a counterpoise.

#### Lapse of Paramountcy

British Government's Cabinet Mission published *Memorandum on States' Treaties and Paramountcy* on 12th May 1946 that envisaged bringing the political arrangements between the Princely States and the British Crown to an end, and for the rights surrendered by the States—defence, foreign policy and communications—to the British to revert to the States when the Dominions of India and Pakistan came be created. Thus, with the withdrawal of paramountcy, the Princely States were to become independent, and the division of British India was not to affect the States at all.

562 independent States! That would have meant ominous prospects of civil wars, military takeovers, and total chaos—more terrible than what happened during the partition!

That may well have been the objective of the British. Else, why could they not have so arranged that the Princely States too had to either go to India or to Pakistan depending upon their contiguity and other factors. The Paramountcy could have been inherited by the succeeding dominions. But, British wanted it to lapse, and create difficulties for India. They wanted India to remain divided into as many parts as possible. In fact, Sir Conrad Corfield, the pro-princes and anti-India head of the powerful Political Department of British-India, had lobbied in London and had left no stones unturned to ensure that the "lapse of paramountcy" was incorporated in *The Indian Independence Act 1947* , so that the Princely States had the third option—that of independence.

'Lapse of Paramountcy' was among the greatest disservices done by the British to India. Notably, Jinnah lapped it up for several reasons:

(1)He wanted as many pieces of India as possible.

(2)Not many states were contiguous with Pakistan to have joined it, so it didn't affect Pakistan as much as it affected India. Ultimately 548 States joined India, while only 14 States went to Pakistan.

(3)Thanks to "Lapse of Paramountcy", and the option to the States to join India or Pakistan or remain independent, Jinnah could play his games of expanding Pakistan or contracting India. He tried to grab Kashmir; he schemed to let Hyderabad remain independent;

he tried his level best to get several Rajasthan states and Bhopal to come over to his side.

Blessing in Disguise, thanks to Sardar & VP!

The malafide intention of the British behind the "Lapse of Paramountcy", and the malicious support of Jinnah and the AIML to the scheme, as described above, was so adroitly, wisely, and professionally handled by Sardar Patel and his deputy VP Menon, that what would have been an unmitigated curse (especially, had it been handled by Nehru and his cronies) and a disaster for the young nation turned out to be a blessing in disguise! What matters is how you handle an adverse situation!!

Although VP Menon remonstrated that the lapse of paramountcy was "*the greatest disservice the British had done us as well as the rulers* "{VPM1/66} , he also highlighted the positive view:

"At the same time, I suggested to Sardar that the British Government's decision to extinguish paramountcy might prove a not unmixed evil and that it was possible that good might yet come of it. The biggest advantage was that we would be writing on a clean slate, unhampered by treaties. I reminded him how the federal negotiations with the rulers had foundered on the rock of treaty rights."{VPM1/67}

The transfer of paramountcy to India would have meant India honouring the provisions of those treaties, including non-interference in the internal affairs of the states, that were totally unsuited to a democratic nation. Implementation of uniform and democratic policies across the nation would have met with severe confrontation with the princely states who were inclined to continue their exploitive, autocratic rule. It would have also resulted in the massively complex task of managing relationships with 562 states!

The positive of the transfer of paramountcy to India was mainly, and perhaps only, that the states would have remained part of India, and not broken away as independent states. But, that task was anyway deftly handled by Sardar Patel and VP Menon. So, even though there was no transfer of paramountcy by the British, it did not affect India, because India managed through Sardar Patel and VP Menon what the transfer of paramountcy would have given.

However, all the negatives of the transfer of paramountcy were done away with by not having that transfer at all.

### How Sardar Patel Turned the Tables

Thanks to Sardar Patel, the adversity or the negativity of the "Lapse of Paramountcy" was turned into a massive advantage, when he managed to merge one state after another with lightning speed, expediting the whole process, which otherwise might have taken many, many years.

Sardar Patel's role in consolidating 222 states in Kathiawar was described by Nehru as "*a great step forward...one of the most notable in contemporary Indian history...a far-sighted act of statesmanship... Six months ago it would have been considered an idle dream to think of an administrative merger of hundreds of Kathiawar States, let alone such a merger accompanied by full responsible government* ."{BK2/112}

Writes Leonard Mosley in 'The Last Days of the British Raj' that the British had not factored in what Sardar Patel was capable of:

"Sir Conrad Corfield and other defenders of the Princes were, however, being a little too optimistic. At the very moment that they breathed the heady air of victory something came out of the blue and floored them. The blow came from the clasped hands of those two able political operators, Sardar Patel and VP Menon. When the Congress Party had decided to form a States Ministry they picked Patel as the obvious man to head it. Their mood was belligerent. They despised the Princes and they resented the British for lapsing paramountcy. They hoped and expected that the strong man of the Party would roll up his dhoti and wade in with sound, fury, and effect. Patel was far too wily a negotiator to do such a thing, particularly since he had the measure of Sir Conrad Corfield and admired him as a skilled and dangerous adversary. This was, he decided, no time for flailing fists and loud cries of screaming rage and fury. The blow must be subtle, unexpected, and must leave no unnecessary bruises..."{Mos/189}

*Sir Stafford Cripps had estimated it would take India 10 to 15 years, if not more, to liquidate the Indian Princely States and merge them with India. It was a surprise to all, and a tribute to the Sardar's abilities, that he took, not 10 to 15 years, but less than 10 to 15 months to merge all the 548 Princely States with India, extending India's geographical area by a whopping 40%.*

Writes Patrick French:

"…The Minister was Sardar Patel, his secretary was V.P. Menon, and by the end of November [1947] they would between them have added more territory to India than was lost to Pakistan through partition."{PF/314}

Wrote Durga Das: "But what Sardar Patel accomplished, through the integration of these [Princely] States into the Indian polity in consolidating the country's post-independence stability and strength, Nehru the theorist would probably have flinched from attempting himself."{DD/49}

#### Jinnah's Nefarious Game

Over 97% of the Princely States were in the territory that finally became India. Only 14 or 2.5% of the 562 princely States were in the area adjacent to Pakistan, while 548 or 97.5% were in the area adjacent to India!

Since Pakistan was barely affected, it was no wonder Jinnah supported sovereignty of each State and advocated that they need not join either the Constituent Assembly of India or Pakistan. Jinnah and Muslim League would have been very happy if it was not one India, but partitioned portion of British India plus hundreds of independent states that could have varied alignments with foreign countries, including Pakistan, becoming a source of permanent headache for the emerging India.

The Hindu-Muslim majority considerations as they applied to British India did not apply to the Princely States, because the British policy on the Princely States as per the 'Memorandum on States' Treaties and Paramountcy' of 12 May 1946, which forms the constitutional and legal base, only talked of reverting of power back to the Princely States from the British. Therefore, what rajas or

maharajas did with their states was their own business. In fact, even Jinnah had categorically stated that his plans for Pakistan—on the basis of Muslim majority areas—did not extend to the Princely States. What is more, Sheikh Abdullah had ridiculed Jinnah that his Pakistan halted at the customs barrier between British India and J&K!

## Instrument of Accession (IoA)

The draft of the Instrument of Accession (IoA) prepared by the States Department headed by Sardar Patel, was circulated on 25 July 1947 when Lord Mountbatten as Viceroy of India addressed the Chamber of Princes. He advised the princes, at the instance of the States Department headed by Sardar Patel, that although legally they would become independent, they should accede to one or the other of the two dominions before the official transfer of power—that later happened on 14/15 August, 1947—keeping in mind the geographical contiguity of their States. The draft Instrument of Accession finally became part of Section 6 of the Government of India Act, 1935, and Section 9 of the Indian Independence Act, 1947.

Following the above meeting on 25 July 1947, after six days and nights of hectic work, three types of Instrument of Accession (**IoA** ) suiting the three categories of the Princely States were finalised on 31 July 1947.

**IoA-1** was meant for the rulers of fully empowered States that numbered 140. These 140 Princely States acceded to the Dominion of India on the three subjects of defence, external affairs and communications—their content being as per List 1 of Schedule VII to the Government of India Act of 1935, reproduced in Schedule-1 annexed to the Instrument. Accession was not to result in any financial liability on the part of the acceding States.

**IoA-2** was meant for over 300 estates and talukas situated in Kathiawar and Gujarat on which the Crown exercised certain powers and jurisdiction, and which were not really states as such, but were designated as "states". Under the Attachment Scheme of 1943 some of these estates and talukas were tagged on to adjoining bigger States. IOA-2 vested all the residuary powers and jurisdiction in the Central Government.

**IoA-3** was meant for intermediate rulers, higher in status to those covered under IoA-2, but lower to those covered under IoA-1: such states numbered over 70, and were in Kathiawar, Central India and the Shimla Hills. IoA-3 ensured the concerned rulers did not exercise powers higher than what they had prior to 15 August 1947.

Another agreement, the *Standstill Agreement* , was drawn up stipulating that all agreements and administrative arrangements then existing between the Crown and the States would continue till new arrangements were made. The Standstill Agreement was common to all the three categories of states.

The above Agreements were approved by two sub-committees. Thereafter, they were finally approved on 31 July 1947 in a meeting of the full Negotiating Committee of the Princely States, comprising 25 rulers or their representatives.

#### Thanks to Sardar Patel…

It is easy to be critical without appreciating the complexities and the consequences. There were leaders who panned the whole mechanism of the integration of the states ridiculing accession on just three subjects, without any further binding commitment. They didn't take into account the fact that the devious "3 June Plan" of the British had assured lapse of paramountcy to the Princely States making them free to remain independent or merge with the two dominions. Independent India was not free to dictate terms to the Princely States. It was only when Junagadh acceded to Pakistan that the critics realised the adverse possibilities; and came to value the prudence of Sardar Patel and VP Menon in devising a sound policy of accession.

Although the efforts for accession of the Princely States had been going on earlier too; between *25 July 1947* and 15 August 1947 there were mere 20 days; and Sardar Patel had assumed charge of the States department only on 5 July 1947; yet, thanks to an effective mix of techniques—persuasion, call to patriotism, privy purses, titles, palaces, arm-twisting, threats—used by Sardar Patel, ably assisted by VP Menon, all of the 548 States, except 3, acceded to India by 15 August 1947, and the rest 3 later.

This is what Alex Von Tunzelmann says in Indian *Summer* :

"...*Whatever may be said about Mountbatten's tactics or the machinations of Patel, their achievement remains remarkable. Between them, and in less than a year, it may be argued that these two men achieved a larger India, more closely integrated, than had 90 years of British raj, 180 years of the Mughal Empire, or 130 years of Asoka and the Maurya rulers.* {Tunz/226}

"...*He [Sardar Patel] was impervious to Mountbatten's famous charm, describing the new Viceroy as 'a toy for Jawaharlalji to play with—while we arrange the revolution'* ... {Tunz/169}

"...*For Patel's part, he realised immediately that Mountbatten, with his own semi-royal status and personal friendship with many of the princes, was uniquely suited to help India achieve its aim of leaving no state behind* ."{Tunz/169}

Wrote Karan Singh, son of Maharaja Hari Singh of J&K:

"...As far as the Sardar is concerned, he achieved a task the like of which had never before been attempted in world history. He succeeded in integrating over 500 Indian states and principalities into a united India with the consent and cooperation of the princes themselves, except in the cases of Hyderabad and Junagadh. The peaceful transition from feudalism to democracy laid the solid foundation of Indian unity, and this is an achievement for which the entire nation, regardless of party affiliation, will remain eternally indebted to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, rightly called the Iron Man of India."{Exp1}

The wise Sardar successfully implemented the integration of the 548 Princely States as a systematic five-stage strategic process:

(1)Merger;

(2)Democratization;

(3)Centralization;

(4)Constitutionalization; and

(5)Re–organization.

His tactics were: "sam, daam, dand, bhed".

Not even Samrat Ashoka in the 2nd century BCE, or Emperor

Chandragupta Maurya in the 3rd century BCE 'Golden Age of India', or Akbar in the 15th century CE could integrate the whole of India into one nation with one central authority as did the Sardar within so short a time.

By ceding Pakistan, India lost an area of about 3,65,000 square miles and a population of about 82 million. By the integration of the Princely States, India gained an area of nearly 5,00,000 square miles and a population of about 90 million.

Not just geographical, Sardar Patel managed to achieve integration and unity of India in other crucial aspects too: political, administrative, cultural and emotional. Said Sardar Patel:

"Almost overnight we have introduced in these [Princely] States the superstructure of a modern system of Government. The inspiration and stimulus has come from above rather than from below and unless the transplanted growth takes a healthy root in the soil, there will be a danger of collapse and chaos. Now, citizens of both former states and provinces have the same fundamental rights, and the same relationship to the centre."{VPM1/333}

It can be unhesitatingly said that the most important factor that has contributed to the stability of India has been the integration of the Princely States; and that without Sardar the score would not have been 548 out of 548—there would have been several States less, and they would have, like Kashmir, created huge problems.

Had Sardar NOT been there…

While some of the Maharajas and Nawabs who then ruled were sensible, realistic and patriotic; many were dreaming of becoming independent rulers—some had even prepared to send their representatives to the UN.

*What if Sardar had not been there?*

Had Sardar not been there, the country would have been fragmented into several pieces. We would have had several Pakistans and Kashmirs. Going from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, or from Dwarka to Dibrugarh, would have meant crossing the international borders of several countries, with its requirement of

passport, and visas from those countries! India would have had to enter into agreements with several countries for sharing of riverwaters and building of dams. India's economic integration would have gone for a toss. Moving goods across India would have meant crossing multiple customs barriers.

Non-settlement of the Kashmir issue by Nehru has caused India such a huge permanent headache through the decades. Imagine the situation if Nehru had a free hand in creating several more Kashmirs and Pakistans! Travancore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Junagadh, Border States of Rajasthan, and several more were already on their way to becoming a Pakistan or a Kashmir!! With several countries around, and in-between, India would have had a tough time taking care of its defence.

This is what Mountbatten conveyed to Patel on 19 June 1948, just prior to his departure from India:

"There is no doubt that by far the most important achievement of the present government is the unification of the [Princely] States into the Dominion of India. *Had you [Patel] failed in this, the results would have been disastrous. But since you succeeded, no one can see the disastrous results that have been avoided. I feel no one has given you adequate recognition of the miracle which you and your faithful VP [VP Menon] have produced. Nothing has so added to the prestige of the present Government than the brilliant policy you have followed with the States* ."{BK2/149}

#### Sardar, Junagadh and the Crazy Nawab

The area of Junagadh state was about 3,337 square miles. It is to the south-west of Kathiawar. Its neighbours were all Indian States, and to its south and south-west is the Arabian Sea. Junagadh had no geographical contiguity with Pakistan. Its distance by sea, from Port Veraval to Karachi, is about 300 miles. Its railways and posts and telegraphs were an integral part of the British India; and were administered by the Government of India. Out of its population of about 6.7 lacs, 82% were Hindu. The people of the state desired

merger with India.

Its provisional government, *Arzi Hakumat* , headed by Samaldas Gandhi, also desired the same. However, the Nawab of Junagadh signed the *Instrument of Accession* in favour of Pakistan on 15 August 1947. He was aided by his diwan, Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto father of the late prime minister of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto—who was close to Jinnah. The Dewan of Junagadh, Abdul Kadir Mohammed Hussain, had invited Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, a Muslim League politician of Karachi, to come to Junagadh and join the State Council of Ministers in early 1947. When the Dewan went abroad for medical treatment, Sir Shah Nawaz took over.

The accession was kept a closely guarded secret by Pakistan. Jinnah had reckoned that if sufficient time passed before the matter became known, India would accept the accession as a fait accompli. There were only some rumours; and India made an enquiry with the Pakistan High Commissioner to India in the matter. There was no response. A reminder on 6 September 1947 also elicited no response. It was only on 13 September 1947—about a month after the accession—that India was informed that Pakistan had accepted Junagadh's accession and had also signed the *Standstill Agreement* .

Mountbatten's Dirty Game

The British too knew of the accession earlier, but had kept quiet. Mountbatten promptly recognised Junagadh as Pakistani territory, and advised so to the King in his report. He even stated in his report:

"My chief concern as Governor-General was to prevent the Government of India from committing itself on the Junagadh issue to an act of war against what was now Pakistan territory."(BK2/119}

Mountbatten revealed: "Pakistan is in no position even to declare war, since I happen to know that their military commanders [British, at the top level, at that time] have put it to them in writing that a declaration of war with India can only end in the inevitable and ultimate defeat of Pakistan."{BK2/120}

Pakistan was the British creation in their own selfish strategic

interest to control the middle-east oil, and they certainly did not want Pakistan to disappear before taking roots.

Mountbatten was least concerned that Junagadh, a Hindumajority state, had acceded to Pakistan. In sharp contrast, he was much concerned that J&K had acceded to India, and played all his dirty games to ensure that the accession became disputed by fooling the gullible Nehru. After Junagadh had acceded to Pakistan Mountbatten wanted to make sure India did not use its armed forces to occupy Junagadh. He played his tricks on Nehru and Gandhi to ensure the same.

## Nehru-Gandhi's Soft-Pedalling

Nehru, the PM, remained silent! Jinnah had correctly assessed that an ever indecisive and vacillating Nehru would only indulge in his usual "*international situation and international reaction* " high-talk, but would, again as usual, soft-pedal the whole matter in order to avoid taking any decision or action. As for Lord Mountbatten, the cunning Jinnah knew Mountbatten would not allow India to take any precipitate action. All that Jinnah wanted was that there should be no physical action from India's side. Gandhi, being a pacifist, and more concerned about his "Mahatma" label and its associated brand of "non-violence", never considered appropriate action to gain back Junagadh. Given Nehru-Gandhi inaction, only Sardar Patel could have been the rescuer.

"He [Sardar Patel] rejected Nehru's soft-pedalling in the suggestion that 'it would be desirable for us to send a message to the British Government about the Junagadh affair' with a polite comment: 'I am not quite sure whether we need say anything to the British Government at this stage.' Patel was not willing to let India revert to the pre-Independence years and allow the British to play their earlier partisan role which was pro-Muslim and pro-Jinnah."{BK/359}

#### Iron-Man Calls the Bluff

Sardar Patel vehemently objected to the "forcible dragging of over 80 percent of Hindu population of Junagadh into Pakistan by accession in defiance of all democratic principles."

Commented Patel: "After Partition, we had a huge problem. Those who partitioned the country had mental reservations. They thought that this partition was not the last word, and they started the game immediately thereafter. Among the Kathiawar States, they went to Junagadh and got its accession to Pakistan… We woke up in time and those who tried to play the game saw that we were not sleeping."{BK2/119}

Jinnah and Mountbatten had failed to factor-in the fact that if there were pacifists on India's side unassertive on India's interests like Gandhi and Nehru whom they could manage, fool-around and outmanoeuvre; there was also a wise, don't-meddle-with-us Iron-Man on India's side.

All of Mountbatten's diversionary tactics failed to work on Sardar Patel. Mountbatten tried his options one after the other, as each failed. He counselled Patel on one premise after another: Adverse world opinion! Needless war! War when so many urgent tasks demanded attention! Why not refer the matter to the UNO? If at all necessary, use only the Central Reserve Police, not the Indian Army!

Sardar Patel rejected all of Mountbatten's options and suggestions, and went in for military operations to settle the issue once and for all. That required guts—something that Nehru and Gandhi lacked. Patel did not let the matter linger, like in cases of Kashmir or Hyderabad. Patel tactfully kept Mountbatten in the dark, and moved troops before Mountbatten came to know.

Kathiawar Defence Force, a newly created command of Indian troops, was first deployed in the territory adjoining Junagadh, and then occupied Babariawad and Mangrol, which Junagadh had claimed as its territory.

Sardar planned and executed the Junagadh operation so well that the Nawab of Junagadh fled to Pakistan on *26 October 1947* leaving the state to Shahnawaz Bhutto, who, facing collapse of the administration, invited India on 7 November 1947 to intervene, and left for Pakistan on 8 November 1947. The Indian army moved in on *9 November 1947* , and Sardar Patel arrived to a grand reception on the Diwali day of 13 November 1947.

Writes V Shankar{Shan1} :

"...But he [Sardar Patel] had to contend with two important factors, one of them being Lord Mountbatten...Sardar had to be particularly patient because very often Lord Mountbatten succeeded in enlisting Pandit Nehru's sympathies for his point of view...He was convinced that, in this matter of national importance, police action could not be ruled out in the case of Hyderabad and that the threat of its accession to Pakistan must be removed at all costs. As regards Junagadh he was not prepared for any compromise and finally succeeded in evolving and executing his own plans despite Lord Mountbatten's counsels against precipitating matters or his suggestion of a plebiscite [under UN auspices] ...He [Sardar] remarked with a twinkle in his eye*, 'Don't you see we have two U.N. experts—one the Prime Minister [Nehru] and the other Lord Mountbatten—and I have to steer my way between them. However, I have my own idea of plebiscite. You wait and see...'"* {Shan1}

#### Plebiscite

A plebiscite was held in Junagadh by India. At the instance of Sardar Patel, it was conducted not by the UN, but by an Indian ICS officer, CB Nagarkar, on 20 February 1948, in which 99%—all but 91 persons—voted to join India.

Sardar was not gullible like Nehru to allow himself to be made a fool of by letting Mountbatten have his way, refer the matter to the UN—which Mountbatten had suggested for Junagadh too—and allow domestic matters to be internationalised, like that of J&K, and be exploited by Pakistan and the UK.

## Legal Position & Sardar's Bold Step

The legal position was that the *Instrument of Accession* , once signed, was final and irrevocable. That was the case with J&K too. Therefore, once the same was signed by the Nawab for Junagadh in favour of Pakistan, how could it be revoked? Actually, it was not a question of revocation. Looking to the public pressure, Nawab simply ran away, or rather, flew away to Pakistan, emptying the state treasury of its cash and securities, rather than defending his position.

He knew his position was not tenable. Besides Junagadh was not a state contiguous with Pakistan, unlike J&K. Pakistan had indeed claimed the accession of Junagadh as *final and irrevocable* on account of the nature of the instrument—something it does not agree to with respect to J&K, for which the *Instrument of Accession* was signed in favour of India!

There are several interesting episodes related to Junagadh. The Nawab of Junagadh also claimed overlordship of Babariawad and Mangrol. They had signed the *Instrument of Accession* in favour of India on 18 September 1947: the Nawab of Junagadh sought to have the accession revoked, but it was held that revocation was unlawful, accession being a one-way street. Nawab then sent his troops to Babariawad to assert his claim.

Writes C Dasgupta in his book, 'War and Diplomacy in Kashmir 1947-48':

"At the end of September [1947], the Indian government decided that a show of force was unavoidable. Sardar Patel pointed out that by sending its armed personnel into Babariawad, Junagadh had committed an act of war against India. The princely state which had acceded to India had a right to expect that India would protect them against aggression. A weak posture would undermine India's standing with the Princely States and would have repercussions in Hyderabad, where the Nizam was holding out against accession. In an effort to head him off from this course of action, *Mountbatten suggested lodging a complaint to the United Nations against Junagadh's act of aggression... Patel observed that possession was nine-tenths of the law and he would in no circumstances lower India's position by going to any court as a plaintiff. The Governor-General asked him whether he was prepared to take the risk of an armed clash in Kathiawar leading to war with Pakistan. The Deputy Prime Minister* [Sardar Patel] *was unmoved. He said he was ready to take the risk* ..."{DG/27}

Sardar was really a Sardar—he lived up to his title! Without Sardar, one does not know what other Kashmir-like states or additional Pakistans would have been created—especially, if

Mountbatten and Nehru had a free run. If Sardar Patel had not taken the action that he did in Junagadh, and allowed the status quo—its accession to Pakistan on 15 August 1947—to continue, India would have faced difficult situation in Hyderabad. Indeed Kasim Rizvi, the leader of Hyderabad's Razakar, had questioned: "Why is the Sardar thundering about Hyderabad when he cannot control even little Junagadh?"{BK/358}

#### The Crazy Nawab

There are many stories of the eccentricity of the Nawab and of his love for dogs, including his expenditure of £21,000 on the wedding of two of his dogs{Tunz/216} . In the chapter 'A Junagadh Bitch that was a Princess' in 'Maharaja'{JD} , Diwan Jarmani Dass states that on the occasion of the marriage of his favourite bitch Roshanara, the Nawab had invited Rajas, Maharajas, Viceroy and other distinguished guests, had declared state holiday for three days, and had entertained over 50,000 guests. The book describes the crazy reception of the bridegroom—a dog:

"The bridegroom's party was received by the Nawab of Junagadh at the railway station, accompanied by 250 male dogs in gorgeous clothes and jewellery who came in procession from the palace to the station on elephants with silver and gold howdahs. The Ministers and officials of the State and the members of the Royal family of Junagadh were also present at the station to receive Bobby, the bridegroom."{JD/198}

The Nawab fled with his dogs, emptying the treasury of cash and valuables. Leonard Mosley recounts in 'The Last Days of the British Raj': "The Nawab had already fled to Pakistan in his private plane. He crammed aboard as many of his dogs as he could, plus his four wives. One of them discovered, at the last moment, that she had left her child behind in the palace and asked the Nawab to wait while she fetched her. The moment she left the airfield, the Nawab loaded in two more dogs and took off without his wife..."{Mos/210-1}

### Hyderabad: How Sardar Prevented Pakistan-II

## Historical Background

The State of Hyderabad then ruled by Nizam Ali Khan first came under the paramountcy of the British in 1766. However, breaking his treaty with the British, the Nizam allied himself with Hyder Ali of Mysore in 1767. Their joint forces were defeated by the British in 1768, and Hyderabad State again came under the paramountcy of the British. In 1799 the Nizam helped East India Company defeat Tipu Sultan. Nizam Mir Usman Ali Khan, the seventh Nizam, ruled the State at the time of Independence. He was granted the title 'Faithful Ally of the British Government'.

## Status at Independence

At the time of Independence, Hyderabad was a premier State, with an area of about 2,14,000 square kilometres, population of 16 million, and an annual revenue of 26 crores. It had its own coinage, paper currency and stamps. 85% of its population of 1.6 crores was Hindu. However, the Police, the Army, and the Civil Services were almost completely the preserve of the Muslims. Even in its Legislative Assembly set up in 1946 the Muslims were in majority, despite forming a mere 15% of the population.

There is a gulf of difference between AP[Andhra Pradesh] of today and the Hyderabad State of that time. The old Hyderabad State comprised Telangana, four current Kannada districts in the Gulberga division, and four Maharashtra districts in the Aurangabad division. Upon linguistic reorganisation in 1956, while the Telangana region of the old Hyderabad State remained in Andhra, the other districts went to Maharashtra and Karnataka. Coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema belonging to the Madras Presidency were added to AP. Hyderabad city is part of Telangana.

#### Razakars and Nizam

A fanatical Muslim organisation, Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen, headed by one Kasim Razvi had been fomenting trouble. They came to be

known as the Razakars. At the instance of Kasim Razvi, Nizam appointed Mir Laik Ali as Prime Minister and president of his Executive Council. Laik Ali was a Hyderabadi businessman, who had also been a representative of Pakistan at the UN till September 1947. With this the Hyderabad Government came virtually under Razvi.

Razvi met Sardar and Menon in Delhi to tell that Hyderabad would never surrender its independence, and that Hindus were happy under Nizam; but *if India insisted on a plebiscite, it is the sword which would decide the final result* . Razvi further told Sardar Patel, "*We shall fight and die to the last men* ," to which Patel responded, "*How can I stop you from committing suicide?* "{RG/476}

In his speeches in March 1948 and later, Kasim Razvi exhorted the Muslims "*to march forward with Koran in one hand and a sword in the other to hound out the enemy* ." He declared that "*the 45 million Muslims in India would be our fifth columnists in any showdown* "{BK2/138} .

Razvi challenged that "*if the Indian Union attempted to enter Hyderabad, it would find nothing but the bones and ashes of 15 million Hindus residing in the State* ."{BK/408} .

He boasted on 12 April 1948 that "*the day is not far off when the waves of bay of Bengal would be washing the feet of our Sovereign* " {BK/409} ; and that he would "*hoist the Asaf Jahi flag on the Red Fort in India* ." Razakars continued their criminal anti-Hindu activities. {BK/409}

At the suggestion of his British and Muslim advisers, the Nizam had planned out several ways to strengthen his position: acquiring port facilities at Goa from Portugal; getting approval for a rail-corridor from Hyderabad to Goa; taking mine-leases in mineral-rich Bastar; readying more air-fields; acquiring weapons; recruiting more Muslims in the army; recruiting British soldiers; getting Muslims from other states to move into Hyderabad state; converting Dalits to Islam; unleashing militia comprising local Muslims, Pathans and Arabs to intimidate non-Muslims; scaring away Hindus out of Hyderabad state; and so on.

Mir Laik Ali had bluffed and boasted: "If the Union Government takes any action against Hyderabad, a hundred thousand men are

ready to join our army. We also have a hundred bombers in Saudi Arabia ready to bomb Bombay."{URL16}

#### Nizam–British–Mountbatten–Nehru vs. Sardar Patel

Soon after the announcement of the *3-June-1947 Plan* or the *Mountbatte n Plan* of the partition of India, Nizam declared on 12 June 1947 that he would neither join India nor Pakistan, but would remain independent. He wanted to secure the Dominion Status for his State from the British, like the one proposed for partitioned India and Pakistan, although the same was not allowed for any Princely State.

After much haggling, Sir Walter Monckton, Constitutional Advisor to Nizam, suggested to Mountbatten that Hyderabad could offer a treaty to India surrendering Defence, External Affairs and Communications as required in the Instrument of Accession, but would not sign the Instrument of Accession. Interestingly, Monckton was a friend of Mountbatten, and it was Mountbatten who had secured Monckton's services for the Nizam to negotiate with India. {BK/399} The British, Mountbatten and Monckton were indeed working in co-ordination to fool India, and get independent or autonomous status for Hyderabad—by talking about 'association' rather than 'accession' with India—so that it remained under the British influence and control.

Sardar Patel rejected the above proposal point blank, for it would have affected the position with the other States, who were ready to sign the Instrument of Accession. Sardar also told that if it was not acceptable to Nizam, referendum should be held and the mandate of the people should be treated as final. Mountbatten accordingly advised Nizam of the offer of holding referendum supervised by the British officials. This Nizam rejected.

Wrote VP Menon:

"Warming up Sardar said, 'You know as well as I do where power resides and with whom the fate of the negotiations must finally lie in Hyderabad. The gentleman [Kasim Razvi] who seems to dominate Hyderabad has given his answer. He has categorically stated that if the Indian Dominion comes to Hyderabad it will find nothing but the bones and ashes of one

and a half crore of Hindus. If that is the position, then it seriously undermines the whole future of the Nizam and his dynasty. I am speaking to you plainly because I do not want you to be under any misapprehension. The Hyderabad problem will have to be settled as has been done in the case of other States. No other way is possible. We cannot agree to the continuance of an isolated spot which would destroy the very Union which we have built up with our blood and toil. At the same time, we do wish to maintain friendly relations and to seek a friendly solution. That does not mean that we shall ever agree to Hyderabad's independence. If its demand to maintain an independent status is persisted in, it is bound to fail.'"{VPM1/242}

"But every time any action against Hyderabad was mooted, the communal bogey was put forward as an excuse for inaction."{VPM1/254}

Like their pro-Pakistan attitude, many in the Press in Britain and many prominent British leaders were pro-Hyderabad and anti-India. Hyderabad had been their *most faithful ally* , and they wanted it to be independent and pro-Britain. They did not care if it was a cancer right in the heart of India and had predominant Hindu population of over 85%. Their stand and support, and that of Pakistan, emboldened the Razakars and the Nizam.

While Mountbatten and the British had nothing to say on the grossly unethical, illegal and even barbarous acts of Pakistan in J&K, and of states like Hyderabad; it is significant that Mountbatten, thanks to the elevated position accorded to him by Nehru and Gandhi, was liberal in his moral lectures to India, and wanted India "*to adopt ethical and correct behaviour towards Hyderabad, and to act in such a way as could be defended before the bar of world opinion* ."{BK2/129} However, moral lectures to Pakistan were out of his ambit. Pakistan or Muslims could behave or misbehave however they chose: that's how not just the British, but even the great, liberal Mahatmas and seculars—Gandhi and Nehru—indulged them.

V Shankar writes in 'My Reminiscences of Sardar Patel'{Shan} :

"Hyderabad occupied a special position in the British scheme

of things and therefore touched a special chord in Lord Mountbatten...The '*faithful ally'* concept still ruled the attitude of every British of importance... all the other rulers were watching whether the Indian Government would concede to it a position different from the other states...

"Lastly, on Hyderabad, Pandit Nehru and some others in Delhi were prepared to take a special line; in this Mrs Sarojini Naidu and Miss Padmaja Naidu, both of whom occupied a special position in Pandit Nehru's esteem, were not without influence. There were also forces which were not slow or hesitant to point out the special position of the Muslims in the state... Apart from Lord Mountbatten's understandable sympathy for the Muslim position in Hyderabad, shared by Pandit Nehru, in anything that concerned Pakistan even indirectly, he was for compromise and conciliation to the maximum extent possible...

*"Sardar [Patel] was aware of the influence which Lord Mountbatten exercised over both Pandit Nehru and Gandhiji; often that influence was decisive... Sardar had made up his mind that Hyderabad must fit into his policy regarding the Indian states... I know how deeply anguished he used to feel at his helplessness in settling the problem with his accustomed swiftness..."* {Shan}

Nehru never showed similar indulgence towards the Maharaja of Kashmir. Indeed, he was unreasonably hostile to the Maharaja of Kashmir, unnecessarily friendly and brotherly towards Sheikh Abdullah; but indulgent towards the Nizam under whose regime the innocent Hindus were being terrorised by the Razakars and Muslim militias.

Mountbatten, also Chairman of the Defence Committee, had recorded:

"Pandit Nehru said openly at the meeting, and subsequently assured me privately, that he would not allow any orders to be given for operations to start unless there really was an event, such as a wholesale massacre of Hindus within the State, which would patently justify, in the eyes of the world, action by

the Government of India."{RG/480-81}

What would the world think? What Mountbatten thought? What about his own image? These seemed to weigh more with Nehru. Why couldn't he also think the opposite: that the world would consider India a sissy and a fool to ignore its own national interests. But, apparently Nehru found arguments for only those courses of action where he didn't have to act! Or, where he could avoid decisions and difficulties.

This, despite what DN Panigrahi writes in 'Jammu and Kashmir, the Cold War and the West':

"Even more sensational disclosures were made by Nehru. Based on intelligence reports, it was mentioned that one William Barton, formerly of the Indian Civil Service, went to Lisbon on behalf of the Nizam of Hyderabad to enter into a treaty with Portugal for the use of Goa as a port in case of need. 'We are informed,' Nehru continued, 'that the British Secret Service men have been loaned to Hyderabad government. They are working in the London office of the Pakistan Embassy...'"{Pani/157-8}

By October 1947 Sardar Patel had got sick of negotiations with the Nizam's representatives, and wanted to break off the negotiations. However, Mountbatten pleaded for more time. Why? The British didn't wish to displease their faithful ally. Patel was not the only person deciding. There were Gandhi, Nehru, Mountbatten and others. Despite Sardar's objections, a Standstill (status quo) Agreement was signed between India and Hyderabad in November 1947 for a year. In the subsequent months, Hyderabad loaned rupees twenty crores to Pakistan, placed orders for arms elsewhere, and stepped up its nefarious, anti-Hindu activities through Razakars.

Multiple delegations had discussed numerous proposals with Hyderabad, all to no avail. Mountbatten too tried, but failed. Finally, his tenure over, he left India on *21 June 1948* . But, before leaving, he tried once more to get very favourable terms for the Nizam by getting Sardar Patel to sign a document as a farewell gift to him. Sardar signed knowing the stubborn Nizam would reject those terms. And, Nizam did reject the document! The moment that happened

Sardar declared that thenceforth Hyderabad would be treated on par with other states, and not as a special state.

KM Munshi recalled that a day after Mountbatten had left he had called up Patel, who had responded cheerfully: "Well Munshi, how are you? Is everything all right? What about your Nizam?" KM Munshi was then the Agent-General of India in Hyderabad State. When Munshi asked Patel about a query he had received on behalf of the Nizam on the "Mountbatten Settlement", Patel shot back, laughing:

"Tell him [Nizam] that the Settlement has gone to England. The terms and the talks which Lord Mountbatten had have gone with him. Now the settlement with the Nizam will have to be on the lines of settlements with the other states."{BK2/140-41}

Operation Polo, thanks to Sardar Patel, and Despite Nehru

Distressed about Nehru's reluctance to act, Patel had written to NV Gadgil on 21 June 1948:

"I am rather worried about Hyderabad. This is the time when we should take firm and definite action. There should be no vacillation; and the more public the action is the greater effect it will have on the morale of our people, both here and in Hyderabad, and will convince our opponents that we mean business. There should be no lack of definiteness or strength about our actions. If, even now, we relax, we shall not only be doing a disservice to the country, but would be digging our own grave."{BK2/141}

One JV Joshi, in his letter of resignation from the Nizam's Executive Council, wrote that law and order had completely broken down in many districts and that the Nizam's Police—comprising almost exclusively of Muslims—was colluding with the Razakars in loot, arson and murder of Hindus, and molestation and rape of their females. He stated having himself witnessed such scenes and even scenes where Brahmins were killed and their eyes gouged out. It was estimated that besides the Hyderabad State forces of over 40,000, there were about 2,00,000 Razakars with small arms, and a number of Pathans lately imported. It became morally difficult for India to remain a mute witness to the mayhem, that turned worse by

August 1948.

Resistance by Nehru & the British to Any Action On the use of force by India to settle the Hyderabad issue, V Shankar writes{Shan} :

"The entire staff for the purpose had been alerted and the timing depended on how long it would take for Sardar to overcome the resistance to this course by C Rajagopalachari, who succeeded Lord Mountbatten as Governor General, and by Pandit Nehru, who found in C Rajagopalachari an intellectual support for his non-violent policy towards Hyderabad.." Shankar quotes Sardar's response to a query, "Many have asked me the question what is going to happen to Hyderabad. They forget that when I spoke at Junagadh, I said openly that if Hyderabad did not behave properly, it would have to go the way Junagadh did. The words still stand and I stand by these words."

"…The situation in Hyderabad was progressing towards a climax. Under Sardar's constant pressure, and despite the opposition of Pandit Nehru and Rajaji, the decision was taken to march into Hyderabad and thereby to put an end both to the suspended animation in which the State stood and the atrocities on the local population which had become a matter of daily occurrence."{Shan}

Wrote MKK Nayar: "Indian Army's C-in-C was an Englishman named Bucher and the Southern Command was headed by Lieutenant General Rajendra Singhji. Patel knew that Nehru would not agree to military intervention, but anyway sent an instruction through V P Menon to Rajendra Singhji to be ready to act if the need arose. Major General Chaudhry commanded the First Armored Division which was stationed in the South and Rajendra Singhji decided to keep it ready for war."{MKN}

In the Cabinet meeting on 8 September 1948, while the States Ministry under Sardar Patel pressed for occupation of Hyderabad to put an end to the chaos there; *Nehru strongly opposed the move* and was highly critical of the attitude of the States Ministry [under Sardar Patel].

MKK Nayar also wrote: "Patel believed that the army should be sent to put an end to the Nizam's highhandedness. At about that time, the Nizam sent an emissary to Pakistan and transferred a large sum of money from his Government's account in London to Pakistan. At a cabinet meeting, Patel described these happenings and advised that the army may be sent to end the terror-regime in Hyderabad. Nehru who was usually calm, peaceful and good mannered, lost his self-control and said, '*You are a total communalist and I shall not accept your advice* .' Patel remained unfazed and left the room with his papers. He stopped attending cabinet meetings and even speaking with Nehru after that."{MKN}

*Writes Kuldip Nayar: "...Reports circulating at the time said that even then Nehru was not in favour of marching troops into Hyderabad lest the matter be taken up by the UN... It is true that Patel chafed at the 'do-nothing attitude of the Indian government'..." {KN}*

Sardar Patel's daughter's 'The Diary of Maniben Patel: 1936-50' states:

"About Hyderabad, Bapu [her father, Sardar Patel] said if his counselling had been accepted—the problem would have been long solved...Bapu replied [to Rajaji], '...Our viewpoint is different. I don't want the future generation to curse me that these people when they got an opportunity did not do it and kept this ulcer [Hyderabad princely state] in the heart of India...It is States Ministry's [which was under Sardar Patel] function [to make Hyderabad state accede to India]. How long are you and Panditji going to bypass the States Ministry and carry on...Bapu told Rajaji that Jawaharlal continued his aberration for an hour and a half in the Cabinet—that we should decide our attitude about Hyderabad. The question will be raised in the UN...Bapu said, 'I am very clear in my mind if we have to fight—Nizam is finished. We cannot keep this ulcer in the heart of the union. His dynasty is finished.' He (Jawaharlal) was very angry/hot on this point."{Mani/210}

Nehru was so opposed to the use of force against Hyderabad that after Patel got the same approved by the cabinet Nehru called his

cabinet colleague Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee and remonstrated with him for supporting Patel on the issue, and warned him [being a Bengali] that India's action would lead to retaliation by Pakistan, which was likely to invade West Bengal, and bomb Calcutta. Unexpected by Nehru, Mukherjee nonchalantly responded that the people of Bengal and Calcutta had enough patriotism to suffer and sacrifice for the national cause, and would be overjoyed when they learn that General JN Chaudhuri, a Bengali, had conquered Hyderabad!

Sardar's Decision for Action & Attempt to Abort it

Sardar Patel finally prevailed. A decision was finally taken on 9 September 1948 to carry out *Operation Polo* against Hyderabad by sending troops under the command of Major-General JN Chaudhuri.

Jinnah died two days before—on 11 September 1948. In view of the same, the British C-in-C General Bucher had requested for postponement of the operations, but Patel had overruled him: British were looking for ways to save and support Hyderabad. General Bucher had even rung up early morning at 3am HM Patel and others on the D-day of 13 September 1948 to have the operations cancelled or postponed. General Bucher had even contacted his Pakistani counterpart on the Hyderabad action, against the code of secrecy, as detailed by MKK Nair in his book 'The Story of an Era Told Without Ill-will':

"V P Menon returned to his office after the meeting and quickly planned things to do next. The Commander in-Chief of Pakistan was also an Englishman who nursed feelings of enmity for Indian leaders. When Bucher took over from General Lockhart as Commander in-Chief, he had sworn allegiance to India in God's name. Soon after Bucher heard from V P Menon, he instructed Rajendra Singh who in turn asked General Chaudhry to begin military action at three next morning. At seven that evening, Bucher contacted Karachi and spoke with his counterpart there. The conversation was in French. Next morning at ten, V P Menon walked into Bucher's room. Assuming that he had come for details of the Hyderabad action, Bucher brought him up to date with its progress. VP then said, 'I know all that. I have come for something else. Did you speak with

Pakistan's Commander in-Chief yesterday evening?' Hearing this, Bucher's face went pale. 'VP, are you saying that we friends cannot speak with each other?' 'Was that a friendly conversation?' 'Do you doubt it?' 'Why did you speak in French?' 'Have you started tapping telephones?' "Shouldn't we if circumstance warrant? Was it really a friendly chat?' 'Of course!' V P Menon took out a document and gave to Bucher. It was the transcript of the previous evening's conversation and an English translation which read: Bucher: Attack on Hyderabad begins tonight. Will not last many days. If you have to do anything, do it right away. Pakistan C-in-C: Thanks. Shall inform Liaqat Ali. Jinnah is on his deathbed. Bucher: After I do my duty, I shall be in your hands.' Bucher who had pretended to be offended by telephone-tapping was sweating now. He looked sorrowfully at V P Menon and said, 'What should I do, VP? I have made a mistake. I am sorry.' V P Menon asked him, 'Did you not swear allegiance to India in the name of God, with your hand on the Bible?' Bucher: 'VP, please save me. I am willing to atone for what I have done. Don't humiliate me. Help me for our old friendship.' V P Menon obtained a letter from Bucher that read, 'I resign on personal and health grounds. Please accept it immediately' and left. General Cariappa was then given charge of the Indian Army."{MKN}

#### The Actual Operations

Very tactfully, Sardar Patel waited for Mountbatten to first go from India for ever, which he did on 21 June 1948—lest he should interfere in the matter. Patel's most formidable obstacle lay in Mountbatten and Nehru, who had been converted by Mountbatten to his point of view—not to let Indian Army move into Hyderabad. Had Gandhi been alive, perhaps Nehru-Gandhi combine would not have allowed the action that Sardar took—Gandhi being a pacifist.

...Sardar [Patel] was aware of the influence which Lord Mountbatten exercised over both Pandit Nehru and Gandhiji; often that influence was decisive... Sardar had made up his mind that Hyderabad must fit into his policy regarding the Indian states... I know how deeply anguished he used to feel at his helplessness in settling the problem with his accustomed swiftness... the decision about the Police Action in Hyderabad in which case Sardar [Patel]

described the dissent of Rajaji and Pandit Nehru as '*the wailing of two widows as to how their departed husband [meaning Gandhiji] would have reacted to the decision involving such a departure from non-violence* .'

—V Shankar{Shan}

Sardar Patel had fixed the zero hour for the Army to move into Hyderabad twice, and twice he had to postpone it under intense political pressure from Nehru and Rajaji [C.R.]. When the zero hour was fixed the third time by Patel, again it was sought to be cancelled in response to the appeal of the Nizam to Rajaji. Nehru and Rajaji instead directed VP Menon and HM Patel to draft suitable reply to Nizam on his appeal. Nehru and Rajaji didn't realise that the Nizam was all along buying time to strengthen himself, and not to reach any amicable settlement. By then Sardar had had enough of Hamlet Nehru.

While the reply to Nizam was being readied, Sardar Patel, summarily announced that the Army had already moved in, and nothing could be done to halt it. This he did after taking the Defence Minister, Baldev Singh, into confidence!{DD/285}

The operations commenced on 13 September 1948, and after about four days of operations lasting 108 hours{VPM1/256} , the Hyderabad Army surrendered, with Major-General El Edroos, commander of the Hyderabad Army, asking his troops to yield; and Major-General JN Chaudhuri entered Hyderabad city on 18 September 1948, taking charge as Military Governor. His administration continued till December 1949. Kasim Razvi was arrested on 19 September 1948.

Major-General JN Chaudhuri had recorded what Sardar Patel had told him prior to the Hyderabad-action: "If I did well, I would take the credit; but if things went wrong, I would be blamed, but whatever I did, I would be supported. This was the wonderful thing about working with Sardar Patel. He gave a feeling of intimacy."{JNC/146} The trust that Sardar Patel reposed in his men, and the wholehearted backing that he gave them spurred them to action, success and victory.

Wrote MKK Nayar: "The Indian Army set out on fourteenth of

August and reached the outskirts of Hyderabad on sixteenth morning. The Nizam's commander advised him to surrender. The Nizam was an escapist and he was also not averse to sacrificing others to save himself. He secretly contacted Munshi in Delhi and agreed to sign the Instrument of Accession. He had quickly come to this decision because of some sad tidings from Karachi. Jinnah had died and the news had stunned Ali and Razvi who were leading the bloodshed in Hyderabad. Razvi had in fact disappeared. Within a few hours of receiving Nizam's message in Delhi, V P Menon flew into Hyderabad. He was not satisfied with obtaining a mere signature of the Nizam on the Agreement. He made him issue a proclamation declaring unconditional surrender to the Indian Government. VP also secured from Nizam an authorization to his London banker to transfer to the Government of India the money in his account there. VP oversaw the establishment of military rule in Hyderabad under General Chaudhry and went back to Delhi."{MKN}

Wrote Durga Das on the above episode: "I kept the tab on this midnight drama from my house through telephonic contact with Patel's residence. Not unexpectedly, Nehru and C.R. [Rajaji] were at once agitated and worried about whether it would provoke retaliation by Pakistan. But, within twenty-four hours, the action was successfully underway and there were smiles all around."{DD/285}

Had Sardar Patel not showed such determination and guts, and had he not ignored the tame alternative suggested by Nehru and Rajaji, Hyderabad would have been another Kashmir or Pakistan!

## Nizam's Come-Down

Nizam had not only appealed to the President of the USA to intervene; but had also sent a delegation to the UN Security Council to present his case. He finally withdrew his case from the UN on 23 September 1948. On 23 November 1949, the Nizam issued a *firman* accepting the Constitution of India that was being framed then.

## Sardar Patel, Post Liberation

Post Liberation, the Nizam personally received Sardar Patel at the airport when he visited Hyderabad. True to his nature of never walking over his fallen enemies, Sardar Patel was most courteous

with the Nizam. That won the Nizam over, and both remained good friends thereafter. The Nizam subsequently wrote to Sardar: "*Your great personality is a valuable asset to India at this critical period when the whole world is in turmoil* ." The Nizam wrote to Sardar several times enquiring about his health.

Addressing the gathering at Osmania University, Sardar Patel said: "Now we must draw a curtain on the past. Everyone in the country should join together in making India a great country. People must maintain complete communal amity; for, we have all been born and brought up on the Indian soil, and we have to live and die together on the same soil."

On his visit to Hyderabad in October 1950, addressing a public rally at Fateh Maidan, Patel said:

"…We are prepared to forget and forgive, but if anyone wishes to be a martyr and gets his name registered in God's book as such, how can we help it?... I do wish to say to the Muslims that they are equals, that they have equal rights as Indian citizens, and that they are entitled to live in peace and in complete protection of the law and the Government. At the same time, every Indian citizen, whether he is a Hindu or a Muslim, will have to behave as an Indian, feel as an Indian and act as an Indian, and sooner he realises this the better. Some think that Pakistan is a place of pilgrimage for them. If they really believe that is so, it is their duty to leave without delay. We shall place no difficulty in their path… Such a departure would be in the interests not only of the man who feels this way, but also in the interests of the Muslims of India."{BK/418}
