# Kashmir, Sardar & Botch-up by Nehru

### J&K Problem thanks to Nehru usurping Patel's Role

The vexed J&K problem that has been bedevilling India since independence would actually have been a non-issue, and solved soon after independence, had the responsibility to handle it remained with Sardar Patel. But, Nehru, in his hubris, usurped Sardar's role, and committed one blunder after another to create a problem from a non-problem, and then to so complicate the problem as to make it virtually insolvable—ignoring sane advices from Sardar Patel and from other quarters.

As described in detail in earlier chapters, the matter of Princely States was under the States Ministry, which was under the charge of Sardar Patel. Patel had ably dealt with the complexity of over 500 Princely States. As such J&K should also have been left to Patel. However, Nehru intervened and interfered, and without formally consulting Sardar Patel, or, as a matter of courtesy, informing him, sought to take the matter of J&K away from the States Ministry under Sardar, and decided to handle it himself.

Without the concurrence of Sardar, and without even the courtesy of informing him, Nehru appointed N Gopalaswami Ayyangar as a Cabinet Minister without portfolio to assist him (Nehru) in handling Kashmir. It was this Gopalaswami who had very badly messed up India's case in the UN later.

Sardar became aware of Gopalaswami's role indirectly when he [Gopalaswami] issued a note in connection with J&K, without consulting Sardar. Wrote Patel to Gopalaswami on 22 December 1947: "*This question should have been referred to and dealt with by the Ministry of States… I would suggest that the relative papers may now be transferred to the States Ministry and in future the Kashmir*

*administration may be asked to deal with that Ministry direct* ."

Gopalaswami let the position be known to Sardar (that what he was doing was at the behest of the PM Nehru), and expressed his willingness to dissociate himself from the J&K matter if the DyPM Patel so desired. Realising the position, Patel wrote back to Gopalaswami the next day on 23 December 1947: "I would rather withdraw my letter and let you deal with matters as you deem best than give you cause for annoyance."

Meanwhile, Nehru, when he became aware of Patel's above letter of 22 December 1947, chose to write a rather harsh and bossy letter to Patel on 23 December 1947{Arpi5} :

"Gopalaswami Ayyangar has been especially asked to help in Kashmir matters. Both for this reason and because of his intimate knowledge and experience of Kashmir he had to be given full latitude. I really do not see where the States Ministry comes into the picture, except that it should be kept informed of steps taken. All this was done at my instance and I do not propose to abdicate my functions in regard to matters for which I consider myself responsible. May I say that the manner of approach to Gopalaswami was hardly in keeping with the courtesy due to a colleague?"{RG/447/L-7686}

Response to such an intemperate letter was on expected lines. Patel wrote to Nehru on 23 December 1947 {Arpi5} :

"Your letter of today has been received just now at 7 p.m. and I am writing immediately to tell you this. It has caused me considerable pain. Before I received your letter I had already written to Gopalaswami a letter of which a copy is enclosed herewith. If I had known (that) he had sent you copies of our correspondence I would have sent to you a copy of my letter to him straightaway. In any case, your letter makes it clear to me that I must not or at least cannot continue as a Member of Government and hence I am hereby tendering my resignation. I am grateful to you for the courtesy and kindness shown to me during the period of office which was a period of considerable strain."{RG/447}

Apparently, the letter was not sent at Gandhi's instance, upon

Mountbatten's advice that without Patel the Government could not be run.{BK2/162}

Disenchanted and frustrated with Nehru's hubris, and his improper and thoughtless ways, Patel expressed to Gandhi his wish to dissociate himself from the government in December 1947 and again in January 1948.

Writes Balraj Krishna:

"In taking away Kashmir from the States Ministry and placing it under the charge of Ayyangar who was Minister without Portfolio, Nehru was acting under Abdullah's influence. To all intents and purposes, he was discarding Patel for Abdullah, ignoring how Patel had stood by his side both as a loyal friend and as a pillar of strength through the tempestuous, nervewracking, fateful months preceding and following the transfer of power."{BK/388}

Nehru wrote a long note to Gandhi on 6 January 1948 seeking his arbitration for his differences with Patel. Gandhi referred the letter to Patel. Patel responded to Gandhi:

"I have tried my best to appreciate what he [Nehru] says on the subject [Hindu-Muslim relations], but howsoever much I have tried to understand it on the twin basis of democracy and Cabinet responsibility, I have found myself unable to agree with his conception of the Prime Minister's duties and functions. That conception, if accepted, would raise the Prime Minister to the position of a virtual dictator, for he claims 'full freedom to act when and how he chooses'. This in my opinion is wholly opposed to democratic and Cabinet system of government. The Prime Minister's position, according to my conception, is certainly pre-eminent; he is first among equals. However, he has no overriding powers over his colleagues; if he had any, a Cabinet and Cabinet responsibility would be superfluous…"*{LMS/177}*

Wrote Durga Das: "Two days earlier [before Gandhi's assassination on 30 January 1948] I had met Azad and learnt from him that tension between Nehru and Patel had mounted to a point where the Prime Minister had angrily thumped the table at a Cabinet

meeting and said: '*Patel, you do what you like. I will not have it* .' … Nehru's outburst was basically sparked by the feeling, fed by his courtiers and hangers-on, *that Patel was taking the country to the Right* … [Now, what was wrong in taking the country to the right! Nehru took the country to dogs with his leftism and povertyperpetuating socialism!] …When I called on Patel the following day, he told me that *Nehru* had '*lost his head* ' and he, for his part, had made up his mind *not to stand 'the nonsense any more'* . *He said he was going to see Gandhi and tell him he was quitting* . I said Bapu would never agree to let him go… Patel quietly replied: '*The old man has gone senile. He wants Mountbatten to bring Jawahar and me together* .'…"{DD/277}

Before Gandhi could resolve Patel-Nehru differences, he was assassinated on 30 January 1948. That forced Nehru and Patel together. For the sake of the nation, and to honour the request of the departed soul (Gandhi), Patel sacrificed himself.

It would have been good for India had Patel not given way to sentimentality upon Gandhi's death, and fought out Nehru to its logical end: that is, he should have marshalled all his forces, unseated Nehru, saved India from the depths to which Nehru had ultimately condemned it to, and taken India towards the heights like only he could have.

# Nehru's Blunders, ignoring Sardar's Sane Advice

Nehru failed to comprehend the British Vested Interests

The J&K issue got stretched and complicated thanks to the vested interests of the UK. In fact, both the Partition and the J&K imbroglio are interlinked.

The West wanted to check the expansionist ambitions of communist Russia and China towards the Middle-East and the Indian Ocean. Also, the largest oil reserves happened to be in the Middle-East, and therefore the Middle-East had to be secured for the UK, and the West. How to do that? The regions adjoining Russia and China had to be under their influence: that is, northern India

bordering Russia and J&K.

The British found to their dismay that the Indian leaders, with their socialist and pro-Soviet bend, were unlikely to cooperate with Britain on foreign policy, military matters, cold war against the communists and in securing Middle-East oil.

The Muslim League, on the other hand, gladly ticked the dhobilist of the British requirements. In fact, if Jinnah had not been cooperative, the British would have picked up some other Muslim leader and made a Jinnah of him. The British military establishment had become a strong proponent of Pakistan, and of J&K as part of Pakistan, on account of its promise of cooperation in the military matters. Once the British establishment firmed up that their national and foreign policy interests were best served by having the regions that ultimately formed West-Pakistan and J&K under their influence, they became even more rabidly pro-Muslim League, pro-Pakistan, and in favour of J&K going to Pakistan.

Continued hold of the British after Independence.

Dubious Role of Mountbatten & the British Army Chiefs.

Another factor that had a decisive bearing on the Kashmir issue was the continued hold of the British on India in certain critical matters even after independence. Of course, you can't really blame the British for that as it were the Indian leaders, particularly Nehru, who invited or allowed the British "help" or interference.

During the initial period of independence, the Commander-in-Chiefs of both the Indian and the Pakistani Army were British— Lockhart, followed by Bucher for India; and Messervey, followed by Gracey for Pakistan—with another British, Sir Claude Auchinleck, as the Supreme Commander, to whom the chiefs of the army, the air force and the navy of both India and Pakistan reported. There were also many British officers in both the armies: many more in the Pakistani Army, than the Indian, as the British were mostly pro-Pakistan and anti-India.

The role of Mountbatten in the integration of the three states that created problems—Junagadh, Hyderabad and J&K—was dubious. Where the British interests were not affected—in respect of the other Princely States—he did try to help India. But, where the British

interests clashed with the Indian interests, he helped the British interests.

Mountbatten attempted to refer both the Junagadh and the Hyderabad cases to the UN. Fortunately, they were firmly rejected by Sardar Patel. British did all that was possible to prevent Indian army action in Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir.

A British as the first governor-general and the British army chiefs of independent India—that's queer. What kind of independence movement was it that installed a British to the top-most position of independent India! Totally lacking in any self-respect!! Couldn't we find a competent Indians for the posts? If Jinnah could handle the responsibility as governor-general of Pakistan; couldn't an Indian play a similar role? Did Indian independence struggle of many decades fail to throw up a single such Indian? Why Gandhi didn't volunteer to take up the responsibility?

Writes Claude Arpi: "*Nehru's sentimental attachment to the Mountbattens deeply vitiated the Kashmir issue. It was certainly the most important factor for the failure to find a solution in the first years of the conflict* ."{Arpi3} {Arpi4/323}

Mountbatten visited Kashmir between June 18 and June 23, 1947 and reportedly lobbied with Maharaja Hari Singh to accede to Pakistan. He even assured the Maharaja that India would not take it otherwise if he did so{VPM1/271} —blatantly advancing the British and the Pakistani interests to the detriment of India! Why was such a person made the first Governor General of free India? Why was Nehru so sold out on Mountbatten? Was it thanks to Lady Mountbatten?

Mountbatten was a representative of Britain, and it was natural for him, rather, expected of him, to safeguard and promote the interests of Britain; and keeping British Government informed of the goings on, including confidential matters. Britain wanted Kashmir, a strategic territory, to be under their influence. That was possible if it was either independent or with Pakistan, which was pro-West. Towards this aim, Mountbatten ensured that as governor-general he did not remain just a titular head. He manipulated to get himself appointed as head of the Defence Committee of India ensuring that C-in-C of

both the Indian and the Pakistani Army and the Supreme Commander, Auchinleck, reported to him. In that capacity, Mountbatten secretively co-ordinated with the transitional British Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army; had private strategy sessions with the transitional British C-in-C of the Indian Army, without the knowledge of the Indian leaders; and manipulated to the extent feasible, decisions and actions in the direction the British Government wanted.

Sarila points out: "*Another factor that distinctly influenced the situation was Nehru's offer to Mountbatten to chair the Defence Committee of the Indian Cabinet. It was this committee and not the Indian Cabinet as a whole that made decisions on Kashmir war policy. This power gave the governor-general enormous power to influence the course of fighting* ."{Sar/357}

Nehru, by allowing the critical decisions on Kashmir to be taken by the Defence Committee headed/chaired by Mountbatten between August 1947 to June 1948, rather than by the Cabinet (which was the right and legitimate forum), allowed the matters to be controlled by the British and Mountbatten, having their own vested interests, that were in conflict with those of India. Ultimately, through these machinations, the clever British managed to dupe India into referring the J&K affair to the UN. {DG/43}

Writes C Dasgupta in his book, 'War and Diplomacy in Kashmir 1947-48':

"The role of Mountbatten and the British service chiefs made it virtually impossible for India to meet this requirement [of secrecy and surprise of military operations in J&K] in 1947-48. Not only were brakes applied on plans to strike at the invaders at their bases across the border but the British government was kept informed at every stage and was thus enabled to take diplomatic steps to close India's military options."{DG/109}

Height of the matter was that General Cariappa, who lead successful operations in Kashmir, including 'Operation Kipper' and 'Operation Vijay', in order to succeed, had to not only fight the enemy headed by the British Army Chief for Pakistan, Messervey,

but had to keep his own British Army Chief for India, Roy Bucher, in the dark, lest he leak or abort the plans.{DG/137}

Earlier, "the decision that arms should be supplied to Kashmir [in early October 1947] on top-priority basis was simply derailed by the [British] Commander-in-Chief [of India], General Lockhart, acting in collusion with Field Marshal Auchinleck."{DG/42}

Nehru discovered that India's British Commander-in-Chief had known of Pakistani-led tribal invasion of Kashmir in advance, but had withheld that vital information from India. He had to subsequently resign.{DG/133}

Writes Dasgupta: "The strategic solution envisioned by Nehru as early as in December 1947 could not be implemented in practice so long as a British general held the post of Commander-in-Chief."{DG/190}

Nehru teamed-up with Sheikh Abdullah, who Deceived

Sheikh Abdullah had endeared himself to Nehru—who had called him *my blood-brother* —and others by projecting an anti-feudal, democratic, leftist, pro-India, pro-Congress, and above all, a secular image: perhaps to get Hari Singh out of the way, and then to sit in his place; for his later actions belied that image, and disappointed and shocked Nehru.

S. Gopal, Nehru's biographer, had written that Nehru regarded Abdullah as 'an old friend and colleague and blood-brother'. Nehru held Abdullah beyond suspicion, and trusted him fully. *For Nehru, Abdullah was Kashmir, and Kashmir was Abdullah! {* BK/372}

To have reposed such blind faith in Sheikh Abdullah and in his capability to deliver, grossly overestimating his popularity and remaining innocently unsuspicious of his intentions, even to the extent of being unfair, unjust and insulting to the Maharaja, reflected negatively on the expected leader-like qualities from Nehru.

Sheikh Abdullah was made 'Head of the Emergency Administration' in J&K on 30 October 1947 by Maharaja Hari Singh at the instance of Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi. He took oath as Prime Minister of Kashmir on 17 March 1948. He was accused of rigging elections to the Constituent Assembly in 1951. He was

dismissed as Prime Minister on 8 August 1953, and was arrested and later jailed for eleven years upon being accused of conspiracy against the State in what came to be known as the 'Kashmir Conspiracy Case'. Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed was appointed in his place—it was him who had arrested Sheikh Abdullah. Wrote MO Mathai:

"When Feroze Gandhi [Indira Gandhi's husband] heard of the arrest of Sheikh Abdullah in 1953 he came to my study beaming. He said that Bakshi did a foolish thing in arresting Sheikh Abdullah, and added that Bakshi should have had Sheikh Abdullah taken to the top of a lonely hill on the Azad Kashmir border, pushed down and shot, and published the news that Abdullah had fled to Pakistan." {Mac2/L-5660}

Wrote Balraj Krishna:

"Nehru himself came round to Patel's view later in 1962, when he told Mullik of Abdullah's 'communal activities throughout the period he had acted as the National Conference leader. It was the Pakistani aggression which had mellowed him a little for a short time, because the tribals had committed gruesome atrocities on the Muslim population in the Valley. But, as soon as he became Prime Minister, he came out in his true colours once again and started his anti-Hindu activities... his entire outlook and behaviour was based on the fact that the Kashmir Valley had a Muslim majority.'"{BK/395-6}

Reliance on Abdullah, rather than on Maharaja States V Shankar:{Shan}

"...Pandit Nehru regarded it as axiomatic that only Sheikh Abdullah could deliver the goods and was prepared to make any concessions to him to seek his support...*Sardar did not trust Sheikh nor did he share Pandit Nehru's assessment of his influence in the State. He felt that our case in Jammu and Kashmir had to be met on the basis of the Maharaja executing the Instrument of Accession, the thought of antagonising the one on whose signature on that document alone we could justify our legal case in Jammu and Kashmir was distressing to him* ...

"Sardar also felt it would be in the long-term interests of India to

utilise the Maharaja's undoubted influence among the various sections of the people to force a permanent bond between the State and India...He was doubtful if the weakening of the administrative authority by the Maharaja to the extent demanded by the Sheikh was in the interests of the State and India. He felt that the last thing that should occur at that critical period was for the Maharaja and the Sheikh to work at cross-purposes with each other or for the already disillusioned people of the State to harbour doubts about the future of the Government or the Maharaja…

"Sardar Patel also came into conflict with Pt Nehru and Gopalaswami Ayyangar owing to the personal rift between the Maharaja and Sheikh Abdullah. It can scarcely be denied that the latter wanted the Maharaja's head on a charger and taking advantage of the wrong assessment by Pandit Nehru and Gopalaswami Ayyangar of the extent of his influence in the Valley he literally wanted to dictate his own terms. Sardar Patel had shrewdly come to the conclusion that Sheikh Abdullah would not be able to deliver the goods in the event of a plebiscite which, thanks to Lord Mountbatten, was the ruling consideration of the time. Consequently, he did not want to put all eggs in the Abdullah basket."{Shan}

# Why Hari Singh Vacillated?

Let's pose a counterfactual: If only Hari Singh had signed the Instrument of Accession earlier—before 15 August 1947! Why did Maharaja Hari Singh vacillate?

It is true that had Maharaja Hari Singh signed the *Instrument of Accession* earlier to 14 August 1947, perhaps the J&K issue would not have erupted at all, because Pakistan itself would not have come into existence by then. But, you never know. Pakistan would have still created problems. And it certainly had strong backing of Britain and Mountbatten. However, let us try to understand why he signed belatedly.

### Writes B Krishna:

"Nehru's bias in favour of Abdullah was evident from what he said in August 1945 at the annual session of the National Conference at Sopore in the Valley, '*If non-Muslims want to live in Kashmir, they should join the National Conference or*

*bid goodbye to the country...If Pandits do not join it, no safeguards and weightages will protect them* .'"{BK/374}

Half a million Kashmiri Pandits would, some forty-five years later, pay for Nehru's sins, and be ethnically cleansed out of Kashmir their home for thousands of years.

After his election as the Congress president in 1946, Nehru gave his full support to Abdullah, whom he called his blood brother. Sheikh Abdullah launched the Quit Kashmir agitation against the Maharajah in May 1946 leading to his arrest. *Quit Kashmir* , fashioned after *Quit India* was obviously misleading, for Maharaja Hari Singh, unlike the English, was not an outsider. Sheikh Abdullah would have indulged in such acts knowing he would receive tacit support from Nehru.{SB2} Kripalani, who visited Kashmir in May 1946, stated that he was convinced that the *Quit Kashmir* movement was 'abusive and mischievous'{BK/375} . Sheikh Abdullah was sentenced to three years imprisonment. In June 1946, Nehru decided to go to the Valley to free Abdullah. Though prohibited to enter the State, Nehru decided to defy the ban. He proclaimed that he wanted to take on the autocratic and the feudal rule that prevailed in Kashmir.

Nehru did not seem to realise that the support of the princes and their collaboration would be indispensable in the coming months for persuading them to accede to India. To take on the Maharaja at that stage, and that too as Congress president, did not appear to be politically wise. Sardar Patel and others tried to dissuade him, yet he went.

Sardar wrote to DP Mishra:

"He [Nehru] has done many things recently which have caused us great embarrassment. His actions in Kashmir…are acts of emotional insanity and it puts tremendous strain on us to set the matters right." {BK/243-4}

Even Gandhi, when he went for his only visit to Kashmir in 1947, pointedly rejected the hospitality of the Maharaja, and remained the guest of the National Conference of Sheikh Abdullah.

Rebuffed thus by Gandhi, having been consistently rubbed the wrong way, experiencing the hostility of Nehru towards him over the last many months, and watching the commitment being shown to his

arch enemy, Sheikh Abdullah, why Hari Singh, anybody in his place —Nehru himself, were he in Maharaja's shoes—would have hesitated to accede to India. Hari Singh calculated that he only stood to lose by joining India, and that he would have no future with Nehru and Gandhi at the helm. Pakistan he surely did not wish to join. But the Maharaja certainly did not relish the insistence from Nehru to hand over power to Sheikh Abdullah—as if he [the Maharaja] were some foreign power who should hand over power to a native. So, Hari Singh started considering his option for independence, which was legally permissible.

Hari Singh did have preference for India over Pakistan . Incidentally, while Pakistan had signed Standstill Agreement (status quo) with J&K; India did not sign it, even though offered. Why?

If Nehru had dealt with Hari Singh wisely looking to the political options, had Nehru not allowed his personal bias to dominate, had Nehru accommodated Maharaja suitably, had Nehru convinced him that his interests would be suitably protected if he joined India, Hari Singh may not have dithered and would have signed the Instrument of Accession well before 15 August 1947; and J&K would never have been an issue at all! There was nothing bad about being anti-feudal and hence anti-Maharaja, only it was imprudent, given the situation. Nehru should have tackled Hari Singh like Sardar Patel tackled the other 547 rajas and maharajas. However, Nehru, rather than giving a sympathetic hearing to Maharaja, and tackling him in a way that could lead to a favourable decision, appeared to be vindictive.

Mountbatten was reported to have remarked about Nehru:

"I thought he [Nehru] wanted to make the Maharaja lick his boots..."{MND/47}

Further, the Maharaja did offer accession in September, 1947, which Nehru refused, laying down conditions unacceptable to the Maharaja! Was it not queer—the nation being favoured with accession laying down conditions!! But, that was Nehru!!!

Sardar's Correct Assessment of Sheikh Abdullah

BN Mullik, who was the then Deputy Director of the IB—the Intelligence Bureau—with charge of Kashmir, and later head of the IB, wrote in his book, '*My Years with Nehru: Kashmir'* that his report

of Kashmir of 1949 stating, inter alia, intense local anti-Pak feelings and no weakening in Sheikh Abdulla's ideological commitment to India so pleased Nehru that he had copies of the report circulated to all embassies and ministries. However, the realist and wise Sardar Patel, with a gifted for making right judgements, was not amused. Here are extracts from the book:

"…Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was unhappy. This report of mine apparently went against the views which he had held about Kashmir in general and Sheikh Abdullah in particular. *He suspected that the Sheikh was not genuine and was misleading Pandit Nehru and was not happy that the report should have been given such wide circulation* … A few days after I had sent the report, the Home Secretary informed me that the Sardar did not agree with my assessment and had taken exception to the fact that I had submitted this report without first consulting him…

I got a summons to see the Sardar the next day. He was not well and was seated on his bed. He looked at me quietly for some time. Then he asked me whether I had written the report, a copy of which was in his hands. I replied in the affirmative. He asked me why I had sent a copy of this to Jawaharlal without consulting him. I replied that I had submitted the report to the Director. Sardar Patel then enquired whether I knew that Jawaharlal had sent copies of this report to all our embassies abroad and what was my reaction to this. I said that I had heard about the circulation only the previous day from the Home Secretary and I was naturally happy to hear that the Prime Minister thought so well of my report that he had thought fit to circulate it to our Ambassadors abroad. *The Sardar then said that he did not agree with my assessment of the situation in Kashmir in general and of Sheikh Abdullah in particular* …

The Sardar then gave me his own views about Sheikh Abdullah. *He apprehended that Sheikh Abdullah would ultimately let down India and Jawaharlal Nehru and would come out in his real colours* ; his antipathy to the Maharaja was not really an antipathy to a ruler as such, but to the

Dogras in general and with the Dogras he identified the rest of the majority community in India. In his slow voice, he firmly told me that my assessment of Sheikh Abdullah was wrong, though my assessment of public opinion in Kashmir valley about accession was probably correct. After having pointed out what he considered to be my error in judgment, he was, however, good enough to say that *he agreed with my views that I should submit only independent assessments to the Government and not tailor them to suit the known or anticipated views of particular leaders* . *He said that I would soon discover my error but* , at the same time, he complimented me on the way the report had been written and the pains I had taken over it. *This was the greatness of the Sardar.* Whilst disagreeing with my views, he recognised my right to express them…

*That day I came back to my office wondering whether I had really made a mistake in my assessment of Kashmir and whether what the Sardar had said was not right after all. Events, as they turned out subsequently, proved that the Sardar was right and I was not. Within three years we found ourselves fighting against Sheikh Abdullah* . Sardar Patel was dead by then. Yet, I feel that possibly events might have turned out differently and the subsequent pain, turmoil, and embarrassments could have been avoided if the special difficulties of Kashmir had been understood by all concerned and they had guided their talks and modified their actions on the basis of this understanding. *Probably, things would not have come to this pass at all if the Sardar was still living, because Sheikh Abdullah had a very wholesome respect and fear for him* ."{BNM2/16-17}

Writes Howard Schaffer: "The Indians had made Abdullah a member of their UN delegation, no doubt in the expectation that he would be an effective spokesman for India's cause. They could not have calculated that he would undercut their position by calling for Kashmir's independence in a private conversation with Austin. Apparently caught by surprise, the ambassador gave Abdullah no encouragement..."{Sch} Incidentally, Warren R. Austin was the US

permanent representative—their ambassador—to the UN.

# Sept-47: Nehru Refused J&K Accession Offer!

By June-July 1947 Maharaja Hari Singh of J&K had begun to take steps towards final accession with India. For example he dismissed his Prime Minister Ram Chandra Kak, a Kashmiri Pandit, who had been advising him on aligning with Pakistan! And, later, replaced him with Mehr Chand Mahajan, a lawyer, who had been a Congress nominee on the Boundary Commission, and, after independence, became the third Chief Justice of India on 4 January 1954. Looking to all this, Nehru should have been tactical in creating a conducive atmosphere, and in taking Hari Singh into confidence, so that Maharaja's decision to accede with India would have been expedited, and all the subsequent troubles on account of his late accession would have been avoided. Instead, Nehru acted adversarial with the Maharaja, putting forth conditions for accession (as if Nehru was doing the Maharaja a favour by allowing him to accede to India, rather than the other way round!) that were repugnant to the Maharaja.

"There have been suggestions that the Maharaja had decided in August 1947, or certainly by mid-September, that he had no option but to join India, and that he was just waiting for the best moment and the most advantageous terms," writes Andrew Whitehead in 'A Mission in Kashmir'.{AW/101}

By August–September 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh had decided to offer Kashmir's accession to India; but, most unbelievably, it was refused by Nehru, who first wanted Sheikh Abdullah to be freed and installed as the prime minister of the State—something not acceptable to the Maharaja. Was it not queer? The nation being favoured with accession laying down conditions, rather than the state agreeing to merge! But, that was Nehru!!

States Sarila in 'The Shadow of the Great Game': "Mountbatten added: 'He [Patel] has also attacked Nehru for the first time saying "*I regret our leader has followed the lofty ideas into the skies and has no contact left with earth or reality* "'...This outburst probably reflected Patel's frustration with Nehru at the time, for refusing to accept the Maharaja of Kashmir's accession to India unless and until

a government under Sheikh Abdullah was installed."{Sar/370}

Oct-47: Dilly-Dallying by Mountbatten & Nehru to Sardar's Proposal of Sending Indian Army to J&K

Looking to the precarious situation, Sardar Patel proposed sending the Indian Army to J&K. However, Mountbatten insisted that unless the Instrument of Accession was signed by J&K in favour of India, India should not send army to Kashmir. This, notwithstanding the fact that Pakistani raiders, backed by their army had invaded J&K, and were engaged in killing and looting and raping! About half the Maharaja's forces were Muslim, the rest being Dogra. The Muslim elements had deserted and had joined the Pakistani forces.

It had been claimed by Pakistan and also conveyed to Mountbatten that the tribesmen were acting independently and Pakistani army was not involved. Suffice it to say that much later, during negotiations, when Mountbatten had queried Jinnah on "How the tribesmen were to be called off?" Jinnah had promptly responded that all he had to do was to give them the orders to come out!

On Friday, 24 October 1947, the raiders, backed by the Pakistani army, attacked the Mohore Power House causing black out in Srinagar. On the same day, the Maharaja of J&K sought military help from India.

The Defence Committee of India, headed by Mountbatten, met on the morning of Saturday, 25 October 1947. However, rather than ordering action to save Srinagar, it directed VP Menon, Sam Manekshaw and a few senior military officers to fly to Srinagar the same day to check the position first hand. *This was actually a deliberate ploy of Mountbatten to pass time and not allow counteraction by India, and let Pakistan gain an upper hand by force, as the British desired* —because Mountbatten would have known through the British C-in-C of the Pakistan army as to what Pakistan was up to. VP Menon and company flew to Srinagar and found the state of affairs to be worse than what was reported. They advised Hari Singh to hurry to the safety of Jammu, along with his family and valuables —which he did. Hari Singh drove the same night to Jammu, 200 kilometres away.

VP Menon, Sam Manekshaw, MC Mahajan, the premier of J&K, and colleagues returned to Delhi from Srinagar early morning on Sunday, 26 October 1947, and reported the desperate situation to the Defence Committee. They advised that it would not be possible to save Srinagar and its people unless the troops were immediately air-lifted. Even the Srinagar air-strip was in danger of being imminently occupied by the raiders, in which case even that only possibility of air-lifting troops would close.

Notwithstanding the desperate situation, and knowing that unless help was sent immediately, both the Muslims and the Pandits of Srinagar would be butchered by the Pakistani raiders, and the Valley of Kashmir would be lost to Pakistan, Mountbatten, to buy time, still insisted that unless the Instrument of Accession was signed by J&K in favour of India, India should not send army to Kashmir, and Nehru went along with it.

VP Menon flew to Jammu the same day—Sunday, 26 October 1947—with the Instrument of Accession to have it signed by Hari Singh, which he did.

The Instrument of Accession signed by Hari Singh on Monday, 26 October 1947, and brought back by VP Menon, was accepted by the then Governor General of India, Lord Mountbatten, on 27 October 1947. With the signing of the *Instrument* and its acceptance, J&K legally became a part of India, and it became incumbent upon India to defend its territory, send in its army and throw out the raiders.

The Defence Committee meeting was held on 27 October 1947, presided by Mountbatten. It was attended by Nehru, Patel, Sardar Baldev Singh and other ministers. VP Menon, HM Patel and Sam Manekshaw were invitees. After the accession papers were presented by Sardar Patel, Sam Manekshaw apprised the Committee of the Military situation. Sam informed the Committee that the raiders were hardly seven to nine kilometres from Srinagar; and unless the troops were flown in immediately, Srinagar would be lost, because going by road would take days, and once the raiders got to the airport and Srinagar, it would not be possible to fly-in the troops. He further informed that everything was ready at the airport, and the troops could be immediately air-lifted, once the orders were

issued.

*Mountbatten—serving the pro-Pakistani British interests—tried to stall, saying it was too late.* Even though J&K had satisfied Mountbatten's condition of accession for sending in the Indian army, Mountbatten tried his best to stall the Indian military help to J&K on the pretext that it was too late, raiders being already at the door of Srinagar. But, who made it late in the first place—Mountbatten himself. Sardar Patel then took the necessary action, ignoring both Mountbatten and Nehru.

*Even when the need for action became urgent, "Mountbatten threw his weight against any precipitate action, emphasising the need for further information,"* writes C Dasgupta in his book, '*War and Diplomacy in Kashmir 1947-48'* {DG/45} . Even after further information was available through VP Menon and Sam Manekshaw, who had been specially flown to Srinagar for the purpose on 25 October 1947, and who advised urgent airlift of troops, *Mountbatten showed reluctance* . Writes Dasgupta "...*the service chiefs [all British], supported by Mountbatten, sought to dissuade the ministers from an airlift on the grounds that it involved great risks and dangers* ."{DG/47}

British were serving pro-Pakistani British interests. But, Nehru? Why couldn't Nehru recognise the British machinations and come to grips with the unfolding crisis that required prompt action from India of airlifting troops to Srinagar, failing which there was a definite possibility of India losing Kashmir forever. What was critical was timely action, not dithering. Sending troops later or leaving the matter to the UN would have meant allowing Pakistan to occupy Kashmir by force, and Kashmir becoming part of Pakistan as a fait accompli, which Pakistan wanted, and to which Britain was more than willing to turn a blind eye. *But for Sardar Patel, it is doubtful—because the British didn't want it and Nehru had hang-ups and was reluctant—if the prompt action of airlifting troops to Srinagar would have been taken* , as corroborated by the following words of Sam Manekshaw.

Recounted Sam Manekshaw, who later became the first Field Marshal in the Indian army, in his interview with Prem Shankar Jha{Jha1} :

"At the morning meeting he [VP Menon/Patel] handed over the (*Accession* ) thing. Mountbatten turned around and said, 'come on Manekji (He called me Manekji instead of Manekshaw), what is the military situation?' I gave him the military situation, and told him that unless we flew in troops immediately, we would have lost Srinagar, because going by road would take days, and once the tribesmen got to the airport and Srinagar, we couldn't fly troops in. Everything was ready at the airport. *As usual Nehru talked about the United Nations, Russia, Africa, God almighty, everybody, until Sardar Patel lost his temper. He said, 'Jawaharlal, do you want Kashmir, or do you want to give it away.' He (Nehru) said, 'Of course, I want Kashmir.' Then he (Patel) said 'Please give your orders.' And before he could say anything Sardar Patel turned to me and said, 'You have got your orders.' I walked out, and we started flying in troops..."* {Jha1/135}

It has also been reported that the J&K premier, Mehar Chand Mahajan, even threatened to proceed to Karachi and offer Kashmir to Jinnah, if India could not secure safety of the people of J&K. Despite tremendous practical difficulties, lack of preparation, and the short notice, the Indian Army rose to the occasion and chased the raiders out of the valley.

It is worth factoring-in the fact that had the Indian army not reached Srinagar in time, there would have been a large scale massacre and mayhem by the Pakistani raiders in Srinagar and surrounding areas, which in turn would have had repercussions all over India. But, Mountbatten and the British didn't seem to value Indian lives.

# Unconditional Accession Made Conditional by Mountbatten–Nehru

Was the Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh for J&K different from other Princely States, and did it incorporate some special provisions? No. The Instrument of Accession was standard and common for all Princely States. There was no provision in it for any ruler to add or subtract conditions. It was required to be signed unchanged. With regard to J&K, it is worth re-emphasising

that (a)the Instrument of Accession signed was no different from those signed by the other Princely States; (b)it was signed by Hari Singh unconditionally; and (c)it was accepted by the Governor General, Lord Mountbatten, unconditionally. That is, the whole process was no different from the one that applied to the other 547 Princely States that acceded to India.

Enclosing his signed 'Instrument of Accession' in the standard format (like for all the other princely states—please see above), Maharaja Hari Singh wrote to the Governor-General of India Mountbatten on 26 October 1947:

"With the conditions obtaining at present in my state and the great emergency of the situation as it exists, I have no option but to ask for help from the Indian Dominion. Naturally they cannot send the help asked for by me without my State acceding to the Dominion of India. I have accordingly decided to do so and I attach the Instrument of Accession for acceptance by your Government."{Jag/86}

Through a separate letter, Mountbatten advised Maharaja Hari Singh that the accession was subject to reference to the people of J&K:

"In the special circumstances mentioned by Your Highness, my Government [so, Mountbatten regarded independent India's government as his government!] have decided to accept the accession of Kashmir State to the Dominion of India. Consistent with their policy that, in the case of any State where the issue of accession has been the subject of dispute, the question of accession should be decided in accordance with the wishes of the people of the State, it is my Government's wish that, as soon as law and order have been restored in Kashmir and her soil cleared of the invader, the question of the State's accession should be settled by a reference to the people..."{AW/114}{Jag/86}

Notably, Maharaja Hari Singh had stipulated NO condition when he signed the Instrument of Accession. Even Sheikh Abdullah, who had favoured accession to India, never insisted on any condition rather, he wanted accession to be unconditional, lest any uncertainty

should remain.

It was Mountbatten who wrote a separate letter to Hari Singh advising that the accession was temporary, and was conditional upon ascertaining the wishes of the people of Kashmir, that is, holding a plebiscite. *Who gave Mountbatten the authority to write such a letter? Who was he to make the accession conditional? Did he obtain the Cabinet approval?* [No!] As Governor General of India, appointed by Indians, was he serving the Indian interests, or the Pakistani and the British interests? He was no more the Viceroy of the British India to be taking independent decisions on his own.

Why had the Indian leaders, particularly Nehru as the head of the government, not made it clear to Mountbatten that he could not act on his own on critical matters—that he had to take the permission of the cabinet?

When the other 547 states acceded to India, did he write such a letter to each of them or put this condition?

One can understand conditions being stipulated by the party offering you the favour of accession. That is, the Maharaja stipulating conditions for his accession to India—however, he stipulated no conditions! But, for the party being favoured with accession to stipulate conditions—that's absurd! Why should India have put conditions upon J&K for its accession? Was India doing a favour to J&K for allowing it to accede to India?

*Had it been a Governor General who was an Indian like say Gandhi or Rajagopalachari or Ambedkar, and not a British like Mountbatten, would he have tried to make the accession conditional? And, had he done so, would the Indian public have ever forgiven him?*

*Or, was it Nehru who acquiesced to writing of such a letter by Mountbatten?* Even if the deed was done without his knowledge, Nehru should have objected to it and should have got it annulled or withdrawn. However, most likely Nehru was a party to it.

The Indian Independence Act 1947 enacted by the British Parliament also incorporated the Memorandum on States' Treaties and Paramountcy of 12 May 1946 as per which the princely states were to regain full sovereignty with the creation of the two dominions

of India and Pakistan from the British India on 15 August 1947, with the ruler of the Princely State being the ONLY authority to offer accession to India or Pakistan, or to remain independent, regardless of the religious composition of the people of that state, there being NO provision for 'reference to the people' or plebiscite.

Therefore, with the signing of the unconditional *Instrument of Accession* by the Maharaja of J&K on 26 October 1947 in favour of India, J&K's accession to India was full, final, irrevocable and totally legal as per the International Law.

Legally, that separate letter of Mountbatten (please see above) made absolutely NO difference.

In fact, Mountbatten's action of writing the above letter was unconstitutional and illegal. Even Nehru had NO legal authority to approve of such a letter. What is more, there was NO cabinet sanction for it!

India should have stuck to this incontestable legal position of the irrevocable accession of J&K to India, like for the other 547 states, on the strength of the signing of the *Instrument of Accession* . *This is what Sardar Patel strongly advocated* . Even US considered ours as an ironclad legal position in 1948. Writes C Dasgupta in his book, '*War and Diplomacy in Kashmir 1947-48'* : "The fundamental difference between the American and British positions lay in the fact that the United States was prepared in 1947-48 to recognise India's sovereign rights in Kashmir."{DG/121} However, Nehru failed to leverage on that.

The funny thing is that the "*reference to the people* " or plebiscite was requested neither by Maharaja Hari Singh, nor by Sheikh Abdullah, nor by the people of J&K, nor even by Jinnah(!!) at that time! It was only thanks to Mountbatten and Nehru!{Hing/200} The position was retrievable, but together they spoiled the case, by going with it further by referring it to the UN.

The British, through Mountbatten, managed to dupe Nehru and India. Of course, Mountbatten's game would have fallen flat had India and Nehru factored-in the vested interests of the British and Mountbatten.

# Nov-47: Sardar's Firm Actions

Writes C Dasgupta in his book, 'War and Diplomacy in Kashmir 1947-48':

"The Supreme Commander's [Field Marshal Auchinleck] days in India were, however, numbered. He had incurred the wrath of Sardar Patel for what the latter perceived as partiality towards Pakistan in the matter of division of military stores. His role in Junagadh affair added fuel to the fire. Patel justifiably concluded that in the final analysis the British officers at the helm of the armed forces took their orders from the Supreme Commander, not the Indian government. He charged the Field Marshall with 'throttling the initiative of the Headquarters Indian Army and acting as the advanced outpost of Pakistan'. Mountbatten tried his best to defend Auchinleck, but to no avail."{DG/51}

Nehru discovered that India's British Commander-in-Chief had known of Pakistani-led tribal invasion of Kashmir in advance, but had withheld that vital information from India. He had to subsequently resign.{DG/133}

Expectedly, Pakistanis wanted him [Auchinleck—to whom both Indian and Pakistani army heads reported] and his Supreme Headquarters, comprising all British officers, to continue, but they had to wind up by 30 November 1947 in view of India's stand, thanks to Sardar Patel's uncompromising position, even though they were originally scheduled to remain for a year after independence, that is, up to 15 August 1948.

Sardar Patel first forced army action in Kashmir despite Nehru's reluctance and Mountbatten's resistance; and then proceeded to strengthen Indian army's position in Kashmir, as would be clear from the following.

Sardar Patel and Defence Minister Baldev Singh visited Srinagar on 3 November 1947, and took a decision to set up the Divisional HQ of the Army there. This indicated that India meant to stay put for a long haul in Kashmir. This utterly frustrated Pakistan and all its grand designs.

Writes Rajmohan Gandhi: "*In the judgement of Sheikh Abdullah,*

*scarcely an uncritical Patel fan, 'events took a decisive turn' after Vallabhbhai's Srinagar visit.* '*The Sardar did not lose even one minute* . He studied the situation and said that the enemy must be driven back.'{RG/445}

"Major General Kulwant Singh and several hundred soldiers were flown to Srinagar the next day. Taking over from Sen, Kulwant Singh freed Baramula on November 8...

"'In the last week of October 1947,' N.V. Gadgil has recalled, Patel 'took out a map and pointing to the Jammu-Pathankot area said that the 65-mile road between the two towns had to be made capable of carrying heavy army traffic within eight months.' He had seen at once that the battle would be long. When Gadgil, the Minister for Works, pointed out that 'rivers, rivulets, hills and mountains' were not so obvious on the map, Vallabhbhai said simply, 'You have to do it.' Around 10,000 workers were brought from Rajasthan in special trains. Floodlights enabled night work. Labour camps, dispensaries, mobile cinemas and markets supported the drive. The 65 miles were completed on time."{BK/369-70}

30-May-48: Sardar Dismissed Jinnah–Mountbatten Demand

Unlike Nehru, Sardar Patel was very firm in his dealings. Writes Rajmohan Gandhi: "Returning from London on the night of May 30 [1948], Mountbatten, in his own words, 'sent V.P.Menon to see Patel to obtain his agreement to six months joint control [with Pakistan] of Calcutta', which is what Jinnah had been pressing for. The Viceroy recorded Patel's reply: '*Not even for six hours!* ' Earlier...Jinnah had demanded an 800-mile 'corridor' to link West and East Pakistan. Patel called the claim '*such fantastic nonsense as not to be taken seriously* '. It died a quick and unremembered death."{RG2}

1-Jan-49: How Nehru Allowed Creation of PoK

On 13 August 1948 the UN Security Council (a)called for ceasefire; (b)agreed that India could retain part of its troops in J&K; (c)asked aggressor Pakistan to withdraw all its regular and irregular forces from J&K; and (d)said that the status of J&K would be determined by reference to the people, after (a), (b) and (c) were complied with.

Pakistan refused implementation of (a) and (c). Pakistan later realised it was not able to force a military solution, and agreed for ceasefire effective 1 January 1949.

Thanks to the Indian Army, the raiders were forced to retreat, and were on the run. This war, started by Pakistan in October 1947, lasted 15 months, and ended on 1 January 1949.

Indian Army's Grand Achievements

Let's look at the two concrete cases from among the many feats of daring and bravery by the Indian army which helped throw the enemy out.

Pakistani raiders' determined bid to occupy Ladakh was frustrated by the superior Indian strategy of airlifting troops to Leh. Air Commodore Mehar Chand flew his plane amazingly to 23,000 feet above sea-level—without oxygen—on an unchartered course to land his plane, with troops, at Leh at the height of about 12000 feet!

Another daring feat was that of Major-General Thimayya. He took his tanks to a height of about 12000 feet on the snow-capped Zojila Pass—something unique in history, as nobody had taken tanks to such heights and in such hazardous conditions before—and routed the enemy, destroying all their bunkers. Incidentally, it was this brave and competent Thimayya who was humiliated by Krishna Menon, when he was Defence Minister in Nehru's cabinet, forcing Thimayya to resign! Later, after Thimayya withdrew his resignation at the instance of Nehru, even Nehru behaved with him in a way that amounted to his double humiliation!!

How Nehru Allowed Creation of PoK

The military commanders directly involved in the operations of clearing J&K from the raiders and the Pak-army were KM Cariappa, the General Officer C-in-C, Western Command, and Major-General Thimayya, the operational commander.

As per the biography of late Field Marshal KM Cariappa, they both requested Nehru in December 1948 for a little more time to clear J&K of Pakistani raiders completely, but Nehru did not heed them. Thimayya had told Nehru that the Army needed two weeks more to regain lost territory but Nehru was adamant. It is said that Thimayya found Nehru's attitude inexplicable, and left Teen Murti

Bhavan, the official residence of the PM, in disgust.

The capture of Muzzafarabad, now the capital of PoK, was imminent. The Army, however, was ordered to suspend all offensive operations with effect from *1 January 1949* , even though the enemy did not cease fighting. The Indian Army was very disappointed by the decision, but orders were orders. Thanks to ordering of ceasefire with immediate effect by Nehru, *PoK—Pakistan Occupied Kashmir* —came into existence; else the whole of Kashmir would have been with India. And, now it is this PoK which is used by Pakistan to send terrorists into J&K.

When Cariappa asked Nehru about the decision a few years later, Nehru conceded that the ceasefire order ought to have been delayed!

Shakespeare had rightly articulated: *There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune; Omitted, all the voyage of their life Is bound in shallows and in miseries; And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures.*

As per a report, the ceasefire decision was remote-controlled by Mountbatten, who was by then back in England—such influence Mountbatten still exercised over Nehru.

Commented General SPP Thorat:

"Our forces might have succeeded in evicting the invaders, if the Prime Minister had not held them in check, and later ordered the ceasefire… Obviously great pressure must have been brought to bear on him by the [former Governor-General]… Panditji was a great personal and family friend of Lord Mountbatten."{BK2/160}

Wrote NV Gadgil, the then Cabinet Minister for Works and Mines in the Nehru's Cabinet, in his autobiography 'Government from Inside':

"In truth, Nehru did not show much enthusiasm for Kashmir's accession at the time… Both the Maharaja and [Meherchand] Mahajan [Premier of Kashmir] pressed for the acceptance of

Kashmir's accession, but Nehru would not move. [Nehru then was being guided by Sheikh Abdullah]… If our army had not received instructions to stop fighting before that date [1 January 1949], it would have cleared the raiders from whole of Kashmir… The restrain imposed upon our army was motivated by the hope that Pakistan would be satisfied with a bit of Kashmir occupied by it. Of course, some of us opposed this view… Sheikh Abdullah was an ordinary person elevated to an extraordinary position by the Government of India… I am afraid that Nehru is responsible for the prolongation of the problem through his willingness to compromise at every stage... Had Vallabhbhai [Patel] been the man to handle the Kashmir question, he would have settled it long ago. At least, he would never have settled with a partial control of Jammu & Kashmir. He would have occupied the whole of the State and would never have allowed it to be elevated to international importance."{Mak/445-6} {DFI} {HJS}

MO Mathai wrote: "Nehru… ordered a ceasefire in Kashmir at a time when our forces were in a sound position and poised to roll back the enemy. Nehru's decision, which was impulsive, was a grievous error much resented by the armed forces. Nehru's was an imitative and an absorptive mind… Essentially, Gandhi's was an original mind, while Nehru's was a second-rate one. He was all heart and less mind. This is reflected in his books also." {Mac/170}

Wrote BM Kaul in 'Confrontation with Pakistan': "We were politically unwise in accepting the ceasefire in view of our successes at the time in Uri, Tithwal, and Kargil." {YGB/17}

As per the article "Nehru's Pacifism and the Failed Recapture of Kashmir" by Sandeep Bamzai in ORF: "...To keep abreast with the developments in Kashmir, Nehru had dispatched his private secretary and 'eyes and ears' Dwarka Nath Kachru to the frontline... Some of Kachru's correspondence is extremely damaging, the prism far too revealing of how the Indian Army first pushed back the raiders and then vanquished the Pakistan Army regulars, even having them on the run... Previously unpublished correspondence [Nehru-Kachru] reveal that Nehru's pacifism—guided by the principles of fair play [?!] and the fact that India had referred the Kashmir matter to the United

Nations erroneously on Lord Mountbatten's insistence—meant that the Indian Army was refused permission to go all the way and reclaim what eventually became PoK and the Northern Areas…"{URL51}

# Reference to the UN

Wrote V Shankar:

"Lord Mountbatten persuaded Pandit Nehru to make a broadcast in which he was to announce that the accession would be subject to a plebiscite under the UN auspices. This was scheduled at 8.30pm on 28 October [1947]. Sardar used to insist on seeing the texts of important broadcasts including those of the prime minister. Pandit Nehru had a very busy day and could not send the text before 8.15pm. Sardar read it and noticed the embarrassing commitment. He tried to contact Pandit Nehru but the latter had left for the Broadcasting House. Sardar then commissioned me to go to the Broadcasting House and ask Pandit Nehru to delete the offending phrase 'under UN auspices'..." {Shan1}

However, by the time Shankar reached the place, the deed was done.

It was imprudent on the part of Nehru to have made this commitment of "plebiscite under UN auspices" at the instance of a British, Lord Mountbatten, having his own axe to grind, without taking the cabinet and the patriotic Indians who mattered—Sardar Patel and others—into confidence!

It seems that Nehru, the claimed expert on international affairs, was innocent about the functioning of the UNSC—UN Security Council. He was apparently under the impression that UNSC functioned on the basis of the high ideals enshrined in the UN Charter and looked to the merits of the cases referred to it. That the member-nations of the UNSC acted in their own selfish national interests and engaged in power-game was apparently not known to the foreign-affairs expert Nehru.

Reference to the UN was something Sardar Patel, Dr Ambedkar

and others were against, however, Nehru again went ahead with it publicly in his radio broadcast on 2 November 1947. Incidentally, plebiscite was held in Junagadh also, but it was conducted by India itself on 20 February 1948, as arranged by Sardar Patel.

With the reference to the UN not yet a reality, being only a stated Indian intention, and with the Indian troops landing in J&K to spoil the British plan, the British cooked up an alternate plan to ensure that their selfish purpose (most of J&K adjoining Russia and China remaining under their influence by being part of Pakistan) was served without even reference to the UN (where it could take indeterminate time), or by resorting to the democratic option of a plebiscite, where the results could go the Indian way. A top-secret note dated 6 November 1947 of Noel Baker, UK Secretary of State of Commonwealth Relations, proposed partition of J&K whereby only Jammu was to be allocated to India.{Pani/34-36} That there had been such a proposal was confirmed when Nehru wrote to the then Indian High Commissioner in the UK, Krishna Menon, on 20 February 1948 informing that Mountbatten had similarly hinted at the partition of Kashmir with only Jammu going to India. {Sar/338}

What was galling was that unlike the wise Sardar Patel, Dr Ambedkar and others, Gandhi was in favour of reference to the UN. Mountbatten had met Gandhi in November 1947, and found that Gandhi was favourably inclined to invocate the UN.{Sar/366}

Rather than retrieving himself from his radio-broadcasts in which he had talked of 'Reference to the UN' on J&K, Nehru made the follow-up blunder of making a statement about "reference to the people" of J&K in the Parliament on 25 November 1947. He also reiterated the possibility of UN-overseen plebiscite.

All the representations made to Nehru against the UN-overseen plebiscite by Sardar Patel, Dr Ambedkar and others fell on deaf ears —Nehru was too much under the ill influence of Mountbatten.

Till then there was only a talk about "reference to people" and "reference to the UN" by Nehru. The matter was not actually referred to the UN.

Finding that the things had begun to go in India's favour (thanks to Sardar Patel's actions), despite all the mischief of the Pakistanis

and the unjust support of the British, Mountbatten persuaded Nehru to refer the matter to the UN, thus internationalising the issue, to the detriment of India.

Mountbatten seemed to have a single point remedy for any controversial issue of accession of a princely state to India: refer it to the UN. It is not as if there was any real evidence of the UN having solved any contentious issue. In fact, things were more likely to get messed up by referring to the UN, as political considerations of various countries would come into play.

However, the purpose of Mountbatten to suggest such a reference to the UN was to allow for further consideration from the Pakistani angle. That was to please the British establishment back in London, where almost all favoured Pakistan over India. And, in some cases, like J&K, get the big powers like the UK and the US manipulate the outcome at the UN in their favour.

While Sardar Patel was against internationalising the issue by making such a reference to the UN, Nehru ultimately agreed. That was a huge error on the part of Nehru, for it converted a domestic issue into an international issue. J&K had signed the Instrument of Accession, and was thus part of India, and hence anything concerning J&K was an internal, domestic issue.

At the instance of Mountbatten and under pressure from Nehru, the Indian Cabinet agreed to refer the matter to the UN on 20 December 1947 under Article 35 of the UN Charter, as a follow up of what Nehru had already publicly committed several times, even though Sardar Patel and Dr Ambedkar were not in favour of the same. *India scored a self-goal, with Nehru formally referring the J&K matter to the UN on 1 January 1948.* With the issue internationalised, India suffered greatly, both domestically and internationally—it became like the sword of Damocles. And continues to be so!

Was Edwina a factor in persuading Nehru to go by Mountbatten's suggestion? Maulana Azad, a pro-Nehru person, expresses bewilderment in his autobiography as to how a person like Jawaharlal was won over by Lord Mountbatten; mentions Nehru's weakness of being impulsive and amenable to personal influences,

and wonders if the Lady Mountbatten factor was responsible.

Wrote Durga Das: "...Patel added that Nehru was unduly amenable to Mountbatten's influence. Nehru had 'always leaned on someone'. He was under Bapu's protective wing and 'now he leans on Mountbatten'."{DD/240}

*Nehru himself regretted his decision: "Kashmir issue has given us a great deal of trouble… the attitude of the great powers has been astonishing. Some of them have shown active partisanship for Pakistan… We feel we have not been given a square deal." {BK2/159}*

It is indeed strange that Nehru, who claimed to be an expert in international affairs, and who had therefore also kept charge of the External Affairs, didn't know the basics of international dealings: every country advances its own self-interest; that UN was a forum for power game; and no country is bothered about what is just and what is unjust. Further, he didn't take the practical lesson from what Sardar Patel did in the case of Junagadh: Patel ignored Mountbatten's advice to refer the Junagadh case to the UN. If one had to talk of "reference to the people", why "reference to the people overseen by UN". It could have been "reference to the people conducted by India itself, as for Junagadh".

# Jan-48: Disastrous Indian Presentation in the UN

India and Pakistan presented their cases at the UN in January 1948. The Indian case was presented by Gopalaswami Aiyangar, Minister for Kashmir Affairs, specifically appointed by Nehru in his cabinet. Aiyangar was the leader of the Indian team that also included Sheikh Abdullah.

Quipped Chaudhry Sir Muhammad Zafrullah Khan (1893-1985), the Pakistani representative in the UN, when he came to know about Gopalaswami Aiyangar as India's representative: "*You are offering me Kashmir on a platter* ."{BK/387}

Earlier, instead of Aiyangar, the name of Sir Girija Shankar Bajpai, the then Secretary-General (senior-most position) in the Ministry of External Affairs and certainly a much more capable person, was suggested; but, on account of opposition he was

dropped, as he was known to have been too close to the British during the pre-independence period.{Akb3/129} B ut then, why was he made the Secretary-General at all!

Sardar Patel was opposed to Gopalaswami Aiyangar leading the Indian team in the UN. He considered him to be not competent enough. Patel had instead suggested the name of CP Ramaswami Iyer, who had been the Diwan of Travancore (please see details about him in the earlier chapter 'Integration of the Princely States', subchapter 'Travancore'). CP, as he was called, was a very competent intellectual, statesman and a diplomat, with many foreign contacts in the UK and the US. He would have presented India's case effectively.

But, Nehru ignored Patel's advice, and stuck to Gopalaswami Aiyangar.

Here is a tell-tale description of what happened in the UN, as told by Shakunthala Jagannathan, CP's granddaughter:

"I was a student living in New York, when the question of Kashmir came up in the U.N. Accompanied by several Indian and American friends, I attended the Security council session, oozing with confidence on India's stand. First came Sir Zafrullah Khan's impassioned and brilliant speech on behalf of Pakistan which was powerful enough to shake up our confidence. When he sat down, we Indians breathed a sigh of relief. The Indian delegation was then asked to present their case. The delegate concerned put up his hand, stood up, and said, "I protest!"… We had expected that our case, so much stronger, would shake up the U.N.! Instead our presentation on that day resulted in a debacle, right before our eyes..."{SJ/45- 46}

1948: British Lobbied at the UN for J&K to go to Pakistan

Britain lobbied in the UN that J&K should go to Pakistan as 77% of its population was Muslim. This was despite The Indian Independence Act 1947 enacted by them and their own Memorandum on States' Treaties and Paramountcy of 12 May 1946 which did not provide for religious majority–minority consideration, or reference to the people, and unambiguously stipulated that the ruler

of a Princely State was the sole legal authority to decide on accession. Hence, Britain was lobbying for something that was ILLEGAL and UNCONSTITUTIONAL as per the laws they had themselves enacted.

Further, if Hindu or Muslim majority was a factor, why was it that the British advanced no similar arguments of Hindu majority when the issues of Hyderabad and Junagadh came up?

Looking to what transpired in the UN, Nehru realised his folly of referring the matter to the UN. The UK, the US and their allies, led by the UK, began playing politics of favouring Pakistan over India, ignoring the fact of Pakistani aggression in J&K.

Patel later told the British Under Secretary of State, Arthur Henderson:

"Unfortunately, it is my experience that the attitude of an average Englishman in India is instinctively against us… We should never have gone to the UNO… at the UNO, not only has the dispute been prolonged but the merits of our case have been completely lost in the interaction of power politics… we were so terribly disappointed at the attitude of your delegation… it was, we maintain, the attitude of Noel Baker that tilted the balance against us. But for his lead, I doubt if the USA and some other powers would have gone against us."{BK2/159}

Significantly, the US demonstrated an honest appreciation of India's stand during 1947-48. The US admitted the unchallengeable legality of J&K's accession into India. The US further elaborated that the accession could be reversed only if India lost the plebiscite, which India had itself offered.{Sar/404}

> 1948: Britain Claimed in the UN: No Pakistani Aggression in J&K

In the UN Security Council the British delegation took the position that there was no case of aggression by Pakistan, as Pakistan was in no way involved in sending the tribal raiders to J&K, despite enough proof to the contrary. *The British had to tell those lies because they were themselves a party to it, having connived with the*

*Pakistani army* . And, not just connived, the British army officers, including General Gracey, actively helped the Pakistani forces and tribal-raiders both in the planning and in the execution of aggression against India, and in the illegal occupation of India's territory. {Pani/59}

All through the British acted anti-India. It is amazing that these brutal British who looted India, became rich at its cost, humiliated and exploited its people, misbehaved and acted arrogant, insulted its culture and religion and used grossly intemperate, crude and abusive language while they lorded here, used Indians in its armed forces to subjugate other nations and were even abusive towards them despite using their services; acted even more uncivilised when in the process of leaving India and after having left India. You won't find another example of such thankless, uncivilised people in the history of civilisation. Just one quote of Winston Churchill should suffice to illustrate their unabashed thanklessness, utter crudeness, uncivilised behaviour, lack of culture and their being out and out racist: " *I hate Indians. They are a beastly people with a beastly religion* ."{Chur1}

### 1948: India Outmanoeuvred

British managed to outmanoeuvre Indian leaders. They not only managed to partition the country, they also managed to put the blame on India and Pakistan, and on Hindus and Muslims, absolving themselves of all wrong-doing. Similarly, the British managed to create a huge problem for India on J&K by getting it internationalised through reference to the UN, and having the accession questioned in that forum. And how did they do it? By making India itself refer the case to the UN!

If we go by the results, while the Britain, thanks to their iniquitous methods, managed to protect their strategic interests that were endangered with their losing the two-century-old empire, and Jinnah got his Pakistan, India was a big loser—it was severed into two and was left to lick its wounds!

Judging from the angle of the UK, the US and the West, Britain's *Partition Strategy* was very successful, and yielded excellent results for them: they secured their oil-interests; Pakistan joined the Baghdad Pact, then CENTO, then entered into a bilateral pact with

the US, provided air bases to them, helped spy against Soviet Union, and so on, followed by active involvement in driving away the Russians from Afghanistan—which ultimately led to the collapse of the USSR.

However, despite all these facts, there have been so many in India, and there are so many still who sing for the British! They are the victims of subtle British propaganda. Or, influenced by the pro-British Indian writers and lackeys. Or, are simply ill-read and plain ignorant. There is no cure for being ill-informed or ignorant.

But, of course, the blame for the J&K mess and the partition cannot be put on the English alone, absolving us of all responsibility. The British were doing what suited their interests. India should have been smart enough to know their games and to protect its own interests. Ultimately, the blame has to be taken by the Indian nationalists. They were upholding ideals quite divorced from the realities. They ignored the reality of the power politics in international affairs. They seemed to have disinterest in foreign affairs—the disinterest extended to the questions of security and defence, notwithstanding Nehru's self-certification as a foreign-affairs expert and an "internationalist"! Their political assessments and judgements were poor. They miscalculated.

Nehru, Gandhi, and the Congress whom the Indian public trusted with leadership, statesmanship, acumen, vision and far-sightedness were left blinking their eyes—the leaders were woefully out of depth to understand the British designs.

Article-370, thanks to Nehru, and despite Sardar

(Nehru's J&K Blunder-23)

Gopalaswami Aiyangar, appointed by Nehru, moved Article 306A —which later became Article 370 in the Indian Constitution—in the Constituent Assembly on 17 October 1949 guaranteeing special status to J&K. This was at the instance of Sheikh Abdullah, and with the concurrence of Nehru. Although many in the Constituent Assembly were not in favour of it, they consented, keeping in view Nehru's wish, who was then the main person steering the J&K policy. Those not in favour included Ambedkar, Maulana Hasrat Mohani, Sardar Patel, and many others.

India, which was a Dominion, became a Republic on 26 January 1950, and Article 370 came into force for J&K.

Having achieved what he wanted through the Article 370, having got rid of the Maharaja, and with Nehru having surrendered all leverages by putting all eggs in one basket (that of Sheikh Abdullah), Sheikh Abdullah gradually began to act difficult. By this stage, ambassadors of the US and other countries began to meet him. This made Abdullah feel powerful enough to start unfolding his actual agenda—of independent *Sheikhdom* . The British were supportive. Said Clement Attlee in London on 11 November 1953: "Kashmir should belong neither to India nor to Pakistan but be independent."{Jag/98} Nehru now began to feel the heat. To his colleagues he could not say, as he had gone against their advice. However, in his letter to his sister, Vijaylakhmi Pandit, he expressed his bitterness.

Why was special provision made for J&K? Why Article 370? Let's examine.

J&K had nominated four representatives to the Indian Constituent Assembly in June 1949—the nominations were made by Yuvraj Karan Singh on the advice of the Council of Ministers of the State's Interim Government led by Sheikh Abdullah.

The J&K representatives in the Indian Constituent Assembly chose to act differently from the other Princely States—at the behest

of Sheikh Abdullah. While the other Princely States were agreeable to a common Constitution, J&K representatives stated they were not inclined to accept the future Constitution of India, and they would rather have their own separate State Constitution. This, they insisted, was allowed as per clause 7 of the Instrument of Accession. It is another matter that the representatives of the other States could also have taken the same position as J&K, for they too had signed the *Instrument of Accession,* which had the same content and format as that signed for J&K by the Maharaja. The J&K representatives also stated that till their new State Constitution was framed, they would be governed by the old Constitution Act of 1939.

It was to accommodate this that a special provision had to be made for J&K in the Constitution of India. That provision is Article 370. Of course, Article 370 was conceived as a temporary arrangement, with hopes of a full integration in time to come. The Article itself is labelled "*Temporary provisions with respect to the State of Jammu and Kashmir* ". J&K State Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1957, comprising 158 Sections, of which Section 3 says, "*The State of Jammu and Kashmir is and shall be an integral part of the Union of India* ."

But why were such special provisions allowed. They could have been blocked by the Constituent Assembly?

Interestingly, poor Hari Singh was already out of the picture. Special provisions or no special provisions—he stood neither to gain nor to lose. It was Abdullah, who after getting rid of the Maharaja, was trying to secure and upgrade his status.

Nehru had brought in Gopalaswami Ayyangar as a Minister without Portfolio to look after the J&K affairs. Before his visit to Europe, Nehru had finalised the draft provisions relating to J&K with Sheikh Abdullah, which later became Article 370. He had entrusted to Gopalaswami Ayyangar the task of piloting these provisions through the Constituent Assembly. Ayyangar did the needful. His presentation provoked angry protests from all sides. Most were opposed to any discriminatory treatment for J&K. The proposal of Article 370 was torn to pieces by the Constituent Assembly. Ayyangar was the lone defender, and Maulana Azad was not able to

effectively support him.

In the debate, Maulana Hasrat Mohani of UP stated that while he was not opposed to all the concessions that were being granted to his friend Sheikh Abdullah, why make such discrimination; if all those concessions were to be granted to the Kashmir, why not to the Baroda ruler too.

Even Ambedkar was opposed to it. Nehru had sent Abdullah to Dr Ambedkar to explain to him the position and to draft an appropriate Article for the Constitution. Ambedkar had remarked:

"Mr Abdullah, you want that India should defend Kashmir, India should develop Kashmir and Kashmiris should have equal rights as the citizens of India, but you don't want India and any citizen of India to have any rights in Kashmir. I am the Law minister of India. I cannot betray the interest of my country."{SNS/106}

Nehru, who was then abroad, rang up Patel and requested him to get the Article 370 through, and it was for that reason alone that Patel relented, as Sardar did not wish to embarrass Nehru in his absence. But Sardar commented, "*Jawaharlal royega* [Nehru will rue this]."{RG/517}

Strangely, Nehru made a statement on Kashmir in 1952, when Sardar Patel was no more, "Sardar Patel was all the time dealing with these matters."

Wrote V Shankar:

"When I was working as his [Gopalaswami Ayyangar] joint secretary the self-same Article [370] came in for criticism in the Lok Sabha. In defence, Pandit Nehru took the stand that the Article was dealt with by Sardar in his absence and he was not responsible for it. I met Gopalaswami the same day evening as he was walking on the lawn of his residence. I questioned the bonafides of Pandit Nehru's stand. Gopalaswami's reaction was one of anger and he said, 'It is an ill return to the Sardar for the magnanimity he had shown in accepting Panditji's point of view against his better judgment.' He added, 'I have told Jawaharlal this already.'"{Shan2/63}

There are many adverse consequences of Article 370. Some of them are: (1)Regionalism, parochialism and secessionism. (2)Denial of fundamental right to an Indian citizen to settle in J&K permanently. (3)Denial of fundamental right to an Indian citizen to purchase property in J&K. (4)Deprivation of right to vote to an Indian citizen, as he or she cannot become a citizen of J&K. (5)Denial of jobs—an Indian citizen, who is not also a citizen of J&K, cannot get a job in J&K. (6)A woman, who is a permanent citizen of the State, loses her property, including ancestral property, if she gets married to a man who is not a citizen of the State. Also, she can't get a job in the State, nor can she get admission in colleges getting financial aid from the State or the Union Government. (7)Hindu immigrants who were ousted from their ancestral homes in West Pakistan at the time of partition and settled in J&K have not yet been given citizenship. This includes their children and grand-children. Of course, the biggest negative is that it has come in the way of full integration of the State, which has gravely harmed both J&K and India.

Article 370 helps protect the corrupt J&K politicians from the more stringent central provisions, and keeps them out of reach of CAG. To the general public, it does not benefit. It is actually counterproductive. If J&K were like any other state in India, there would have been much more private investment in it, leading to prosperity.

Jagmohan, who had also been Governor of J&K, writes in his book, '*My Frozen Turbulence in Kashmir'* :

"Article 370 is nothing but a feeding ground for the parasites at the heart of paradise. It skins the poor. It deceives them with its mirage. It lines the pockets of the 'power elites'. It fans the ego of the new 'sultans'. In essence, it creates a land without justice...It suffocates the very idea of India and fogs the vision of a great social and cultural crucible from Kashmir to Kanyakumari...Over the years, Article 370 has become an instrument of exploitation at the hands of the ruling political elites and other vested interests in bureaucracy, business, the judiciary and bar...It breeds separatist forces which in turn sustain and strengthen Article 370. Apart from politicians, the richer classes have found it convenient to amass wealth and not allow healthy financial legislation to come to the State.

The provisions of the Wealth Tax and other beneficial laws of the Union have not been allowed to operate in the State under the cover of Article 370..."{Jag/230}

Even if Article 370 had to be introduced for whatever reason, it could have been made applicable only to the Valley, and Jammu and Ladakh could have been kept out through certain special provisions, or by spinning them off as separate mini-states or union territories. That would at least have ensured Jammu and Ladakh developed unhindered by the needless restrictions that were the by-products of Article 370. Why make Jammu and Ladakh suffer for the politics of the Valley? There are enough statistics to show that the people of Jammu and Ladakh have been short-changed and benefits have been largely cornered for the Valley.

### Sardar's 547 Successes & Nehru's Kashmir Failure

A troubling question is that if Sardar Patel and VP Menon could manage accession of 547 states, why could Nehru not manage smooth accession of even one state he had taken charge of—J&K?

The answer actually boils down to political wisdom, political acumen, political competence and astuteness; and also the ability to size-up people. Sardar Patel and VP Menon so dealt with the princes that their egos were satisfied, their patriotic feelings were aroused, and their apprehensions were removed. Princes also got to retain certain material benefits, and were bestowed with some honorary positions. They, thus, felt respected. In return, they agreed to merge their States with India. Had Sardar and Menon acted otherwise, they would not have been able to achieve the desired results. Of course, in exceptional cases, arm-twisting too was resorted to.

Expansion of India's geography by about 40% and consolidation of its post-independence stability through the integration of the Princely States demanded great foresight, sharp mind, deep wisdom, high-level diplomacy, sagacity, boldness, guts, readiness to act and timely action—thankfully for India, Sardar Patel answered to that rare combination of qualities and requirements. Nehru just did not have it in him to accomplish all that; he would have flinched from

even attempting it; and had he taken the plunge, he would have made a royal mess of it.

Like Durga Das wrote:

"VP Menon gave me details of these prolonged talks. Mountbatten was just flattering the old man[Gandhi], he said. He is doing business with Sardar and has Nehru in his pocket. Sardar is playing a deep game. He, in turn, is flattering Mountbatten and using him to net the Princes..."{DD/240-41}

See the wisdom and tact of Sardar Patel to get all the Princely States to unite with India! Incidentally, Durga Das was a highly respected and renowned journalist who was a contemporary of the leaders of the Independence movement. He also contributed to the Indian Independence Struggle. He was born in 1900 and passed away in 1974. Prior to Independence he was with the API, the Associated Press of India, which later became the PTI, then with The Statesman and The Hindustan Times. He retired as the Managing Director and Editor-in-Chief of The Hindustan Times in 1959. He knew most of the leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Rajaji and Prasad personally. He had also communicated with the viceroys.

By ranting against feudalism and princes and maharajas—which Nehru did, however right he may have been technically—one did not achieve the desired results or reach an amicable solution. As if by accommodating the rajas and maharajas, Sardar Patel and VP Menon gave fillip to the feudal forces. In fact, they finished them by minimal, modest accommodation, without a shot being fired—except for Hyderabad.

On Sardar's personal views on the princely order, please check the subchapter 'Pathetic Princes & their Princely States' above. Patel had told them:

"Many Princes seem to believe that they should collect arms to establish their authority. But India is not the same today as she was when the British came here… In the end, every State will have to come in [join/merge with India]. But those who come in last will deny themselves the honour they will enjoy now… Those among them who have ability, intelligence and bravery can take up leadership of the Army. They can also

enjoy the glory of serving India abroad as our ambassadors. What for are you rotting in your small pits? Come out into the open ocean of national life."{BK/318-9}

Patel's such addresses to the Princes had their salutary effect, and many came over offering their state's merger.

Patel knew where and when and how to criticise them; when to keep quiet about them; when to threaten, and when to dangle carrots; and how to encourage them to merge their State and join the mainstream, the ultimate aim being to acquire for India all those States that the princes controlled. However, Patel had said: "In those days we were thinking that it was no use fighting with the princes because they themselves were not free agents under foreign rule."

Nehru's over-activism and blind support for Muslims and Sheikh Abdullah in Kashmir during 1946-47 at the expense of the Kashmiri Pandits, and his rancour and hostility towards the Maharaja made the Maharaja apprehensive and distrustful of Nehru and India, and he therefore delayed the state's integration with India till forced by the Pakistani aggression of October 1947. Curiously, the woollyheaded 'secular' Nehru did not show similar enthusiasm and activism in the states ruled by Muslims like Junagadh or Hyderabad, despite the widely-known cruelties of Razakars against Hyderabad state's Hindu subjects!

Why did Nehru think he could afford to treat Maharaja Hari Singh the way he did? He felt that in Sheikh Abdullah he had a great ally. Nehru thought that the majority of the people were with Sheikh Abdullah, who, he felt, was a great democrat, a leftist, and a secular person. Nehru wanted to demonstrate how he was totally against the feudal forces, and how their days were numbered, and how much he was for the progressive, secular and left forces like Sheikh Abdullah. It was an honest and sincere attempt on the part of Nehru, but appeared to be a little immature—lacking in political wisdom.

Later, when it was too late, Nehru realised what Sheikh Abdullah actually was. BN Mullik recounted how Nehru came round to Patel's views, and told him in 1962 of Sheikh Abdullah's communal activities all through.

Nehru trusted Sheikh to deliver—an uncertain and doubtful

possibility—ignoring what he could have got through Hari Singh with much, much lesser hassle. So, by unnecessarily rubbing Maharaja Hari Singh the wrong way, Nehru perhaps spiked what could have been a smooth merger of Kashmir with India.

Apart from, "I thought he [Nehru] wanted to make the Maharaja lick his boots..."{MND/47} ; Mountbatten had made another observation:

"I am glad to say that Nehru has not been put in charge of the new [Princely] States Department, which would have wrecked everything. Patel, who is essentially a realist and very sensible, is going to take it over...Even better news is that VP Menon is to be the Secretary."{BK2/91}

Durga Das wrote: "All were agreed on one thing: While Gandhi was the architect of India's freedom, Sardar [Patel] was the architect of India's unity."{DD/305}

On Kashmir, Dr Mookerjee wrote forthrightly to Nehru on various occasion in 1953:

"…One common feature of your speeches has been and is the abundance of abuses and vituperation which you have poured forth on those who differ from you. You have ascribed us all sorts of base motives and have even dubbed us as betrayers of the country's interests. I have no desire to emulate you in this respect… [On communalism] This is most unfair charge and unconsciously you have been recently indulging in such attacks only to hide the weakness of your case. Our approach to the [Kashmir] problem is actuated by highest national and patriotic considerations…. You will forgive me if I fail to appreciate your repeated reference to possible international complications as a result of Jammu movement. No one today will claim that your handling of the Kashmir problem has enhanced our international prestige or has won us wide international support or sympathy. On the other hand, your policy in this behalf has added to complications both at home and abroad…" {Mak/429}

Sardar, VP Menon & Kashmir

An intriguing question is: Why Sardar Patel and VP Menon did not put in as much efforts for Kashmir to accede to India by 15 August 1947, or even later, as they did for the other 547 princely States? Why did they leave it to Nehru?

Wrote Sardar Patel to Maharaja Hari Singh on 3 July 1947:

"...I am sorry to find that there is considerable misapprehension in your mind about the Congress. Allow me to assure your Highness that the Congress is not only not your enemy, as you happen to believe, but there are in the Congress many strong supporters of your state...as a sincere friend and well-wisher of the state, I wish to assure you that the interest of Kashmir lies in joining the Indian Union and its Constituent Assembly without any delay..."{URL13}

V Shankar writes:

"So long as Pakistan's armed intervention persisted in Kashmir, Sardar was firm on settling the dispute on the battlefield, rather than through parleys in the UN Security Council. In this matter he found himself completely opposed to the line of action and policies adumbrated by Lord Mountbatten who was successful in persuading not only Pandit Nehru but also Gandhiji to accept them. Mountbatten diverted the mind of Pandit Nehru in two directions—conferences with Pakistan and a reference to the UN. For the latter he secured Gandhiji's blessings...He [Sardar] was for utilising the opportunity to finalise the accession without much ado or any further formalities."{Shan1}

It was not as if Sardar Patel and VP Menon had left the J&K matter to Nehru. It was Nehru who had decided to handle J&K himself. Please check details under the heading "Kashmir, Nehru's Hubris & Patel's Resignation" above.

Notably, even the Deputy Prime Minister of J&K between 1947- 53, Bakhshi Ghulam Muhammad of the National Conference, had become so disturbed and alarmed at the way the J&K issue was being messed up that he met Sardar Patel and requested:

"Why do you [Sardar Patel] not take over the problem and finish it like Hyderabad? Patel replied cryptically: You go to

your friend [Nehru] and tell him to keep his hands off Kashmir problem for two months and I will undertake to solve it."{Mak/440- 41}

Although VP Menon had stated that given their preoccupation with tackling the other 547 states, they had little time for Kashmir, it was more a case of sour grapes, the effective charge of J&K being with Gopalaswami and Nehru.

Writes Rajmohan Gandhi in his book 'Patel–A Life':

"Patel was as strongly against the reference to the UN and preferred 'timely action' on the ground, but Kashmir was Jawaharlal's baby by now and Vallabhbhai did not insist on his prescriptions when, at the end of December, Nehru announced that he had decided to go to the UN. Jawaharlal obtained Mahatma's reluctant consent... Patel's misgivings were amply fulfilled after India invited the UN's assistance..."{RG/448}

Jayaprakash Narayan, who had been pro-Nehru and anti-Patel had this to admit later:

"Kashmir issue, being left to Nehru, proved to be unfortunate for the nation. Because of Panditji's mishandling, the issue did no longer remain an internal affair, as it should be, but is smouldering as an international issue in the United Nations and its Security Council, making it possible for Pakistan to rake it up every now and then. Many a veteran leader in the country maintains that had the matter been handled by the Sardar, he would have found a satisfactory solution, and thus prevented it becoming a perennial headache for us and a cause of bitterness and animosity between India and Pakistan."{BK/396-7}

Sardar Patel had reportedly remarked to HV Kamath that had Nehru and Gopalaswami Aiyangar not made Kashmir their close preserve, separating it from his portfolio of Home and States, he would have tackled the problem as purposefully as he had already done for Hyderabad.

Sardar Patel had told Air Marshal Thomas Elmhirst:

"If all the decisions rested on me, I think that I would be in

favour of extending this little affair in Kashmir to a full-scale war with Pakistan… Let us get it over once and for all, and settle down as a united continent."{BK2/157}

These are the remarks of Rafi Ahmed Kidwai, a close friend and a confidant of Nehru, from Durga Das's book: "*You know, I never go to Nehru to seek advice or guidance. I take a decision and just present it to him as a fait accompli. Nehru's mind is too complex to wrestle with the intricacies of a problem. Those who go to him for advice rarely get a lead—and that only serves to delay matters...Nehru does not understand economics, and is led by the nose by 'professors' and 'experts' who pander to his whims and fancies...We should have absorbed Kashmir for good and all...I do not know where we are going. The country needs a man like Patel* ."{DD/379}

Communist MN Roy, no friend of Patel, was also of the opinion that had Kashmir affair remained with Patel, and had Nehru not taken it away from him, Patel would have solved the J&K issue soon after partition. He wrote in "Men I Met" on Patel:

"…Could Sardar Patel have had his way on the Kashmir issue, India would not be today spending fifty percent of her revenue on military budget… the Sardar had no choice but to play the game, but one could be sure that he loathes the stupidity clothes in the glamour of popular heroes [hint on Nehru]…"{Roy/17}

There is also a view that being a realist, Sardar Patel, looking to the reality of the Muslim majority in the Valley, was amenable to the idea of a mutually acceptable arrangement between India and Pakistan where (a)India got to retain Jammu and Ladakh, (b)Pakistan got to retain the areas occupied by it—PoK, and (c)India gave away Kashmir Valley to Pakistan, (d)in return for adjustments in favour of India elsewhere, like in East Bengal.

Patel had never really opened his mind on Kashmir—in view of what all Nehru had [wrongly] done, and the fact Nehru had kept to himself the Kashmir portfolio, he thought it was best he was not explicit, lest the matters got more complicated. Although his odd remarks here and there reveal his discomfort. For example, he was reported to have remarked to Dr Rajendra Prasad that when India

had given away Punjab, Sind, the NWFP, and East Bengal on account of their Muslim-majority, what value was there in a small valley of Kashmir—will the people there ever agree to live happily with us? Sardar had also reportedly told Minoo Masani that but for Nehru, he could have settled the Kashmir issue with Pakistan through East Bengal—Kashmir Valley (other than Ladakh and Jammu) swap.{BK/518} VP Menon's view was similar. Even Field Marshall Auchinleck was of the opinion that since East Bengal Muslims were closer to West Bengal Muslims culturally and linguistically, "East Bengal—Kashmir Valley" swap was a sensible proposition.{BK2/163-64}
