| Apr 1942                    | Jinnah termed the secession clause in the Cripps<br>offer as an implicit recognition of Pakistan; but<br>rejected the proposal, as what he wanted was an<br>explicit recognition of the right of the "Muslim<br>nation" to separate.<br>Both Gandhi and Patel rejected the proposal,<br>mainly on account of the secession clause.                                                                                                                  |

| 29 Apr 1946 | Even though 12 of the 15 PCCs (80%) voted in<br>favour of Patel, Gandhi dictatorially,<br>undemocratically, and unethically made Nehru the<br>president of the Congress, and therefore the first<br>Prime Minister.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 12 May 1946 | British Government's Cabinet Mission published<br>'Memorandum on States' Treaties and<br>Paramountcy' that envisaged bringing the political<br>arrangements between the Princely States and<br>the British Crown to an end, and for the rights<br>surrendered by the States—defence, foreign<br>policy and communications—to the British to<br>revert to the States when the Dominions of India<br>and Pakistan come be created. Thus, with the<br>withdrawal of paramountcy, all the 562 Princely<br>States were to become independent. Thankfully,<br>Sardar Patel frustrated the British design. |
| 16 May 1946 | The Cabinet Mission unilaterally proposed a "16-<br>May-1946 Cabinet Mission Plan".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 16 Jun 1946 | "16-June-1946 Cabinet Mission Plan" for the<br>Interim Govt. Muslim League accepted both the<br>16-May-1946 and the 16-June-1946 Cabinet<br>Mission Plans. However, Gandhi and the<br>Congress didn't accept either. Jinnah was on the<br>seventh heaven, looking forward to be invited to<br>form the government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 25 Jun 1946          | Patel risked his all and took a private, personal<br>initiative to negotiate the matter with the British.<br>He ultimately persuaded the CWC, against<br>Gandhi's advice, to accept the 16-May-1946 Plan,<br>while rejecting the 16-June-1946 Plan, to thwart<br>the Muslim League from forming the government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 8 Mar 1947           | To nip the problem in the bud, without prior<br>consultation with or approval by Gandhi (as Patel<br>had his doubts), Sardar Patel took up the<br>groupings (of Cabinet Mission Plan) challenge<br>head on by promptly agreeing (at his level) to the<br>demands of the Sikh and Hindu leaders for the<br>division of Punjab (and, by implication, Bengal)<br>without wasting any time, and had a resolution for<br>the purpose passed by the CWC on 8 March<br>1947. It was not meant as an endorsement for<br>Pakistan, but a forewarning to the Muslims as to<br>what would happen (partition of Punjab and<br>Bengal) if they insisted on Pakistan. |

| May 1947    | Mountbatten Plan: Mountbatten came up with a<br>plan to quit India, duly revised and approved by<br>London. The outline of the plan was to transfer<br>power to the provinces or groups of provinces for<br>an interim period, who would then decide whether<br>to join India or Pakistan or remain independent.<br>There were no takers for the plan.                                                                                                                           |

Menon<br>had opined that a unitary India under the Cabinet<br>Mission Plan was an illusion; and it was better for<br>the country to be divided than gravitate towards<br>civil war. |

| Sep 1947    | Maharaja Hari Singh offered Kashmir's accession<br>to India. But it was refused by Nehru, who first<br>wanted Sheikh Abdullah to be freed and installed<br>as the PM of the State! Patel was angry and<br>frustrated with Nehru for this. Had Nehru done<br>what Patel wanted, Kashmir problem would not<br>have arisen at all. |
| 13 Sep 1947 | On 13 September 1947 India was informed by<br>Pakistan that it had accepted Junagadh's<br>accession.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Oct 1947    | Kashmir was invaded by over 5,000 Pathan<br>tribesmen in October 1947, backed by the<br>Pakistani army men.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 24 Oct 1947 | Pakistani raiders attacked the Mohore Power<br>House causing black out in Srinagar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 26 Oct 1947 | Sardar planned and executed the Junagadh<br>operation so well that the Nawab of Junagadh fled<br>to Pakistan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 27 Oct 1947 | Mountbatten accepted the Instrument of<br>Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh on 26<br>October 1947. With the above formality done, J&K<br>legally became a part of India, and it became<br>incumbent upon India to defend its territory, send<br>in its army and throw out the raiders.                                    |
| 28 Oct 1947 | In a radio broadcast, Nehru committed that the<br>J&K accession would be subject to a plebiscite<br>under the UN auspices. This Nehru did at the<br>persuasion of Mountbatten, without taking the<br>Indian cabinet or Sardar Patel into confidence!                                                                            |
| 2 Nov 1947  | Reference to the UN was something Sardar Patel,<br>Dr Ambedkar and others were against, however,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|             | Nehru again went ahead with it publicly in his<br>radio broadcast on 2 November 1947.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Dec 1947    | The Indian Cabinet at the instance of Sardar Patel<br>pushed for a very strong military action to fully<br>clear J&K of the raiders. Further, it wanted<br>creation of a demilitarized zone beyond the<br>borders, and proper monitoring, lest any raiders<br>camp be reactivated. This would have ensured<br>there was never a so-called Azad Kashmir or a<br>PoK (Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir). But, Nehru<br>failed to rise to the occasion.           |
| 9 Nov 1947  | The Indian army moved into Junagadh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 13 Nov 1947 | Sardar Patel arrived in Junagadh to a grand<br>reception on the Diwali day.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1 Jan 1948  | India scored a self-goal, with Nehru formally<br>referring the J&K matter to the UN, under<br>pressure from Mountbatten.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 12 Jan 1948 | Patel stated in a Press Conference that the issue<br>of giving rupees 55 crores to Pakistan could not<br>be dissociated from the related issues like<br>Pakistani aggression in J&K.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 13 Jan 1948 | Gandhi conveyed to Patel that withholding 55<br>crores from Pakistan was what Mountbatten had<br>opined to him as "a dishonourable act…<br>unstatesman-like and unwise", and what he<br>[Gandhi] thought was immoral. Why didn't Gandhi<br>and Mountbatten consider the immorality of<br>Pakistan in attacking Kashmir which had already<br>acceded to India?
