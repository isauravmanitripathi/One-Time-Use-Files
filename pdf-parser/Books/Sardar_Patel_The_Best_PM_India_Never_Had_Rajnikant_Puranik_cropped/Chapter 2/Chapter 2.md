# Biographical Outline

"*Work is undoubtedly worship but laughter is life. Anyone who takes life too seriously must prepare himself for a miserable existence. Anyone who greets joys and sorrows with equal facility can really get the best of life* ."

—Sardar Patel{Sag}

Sardar Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel was born on *31 October 1875* at *Nadiad* in a family of Patidars (Patels). 1875 was also the year 'Vande Mataram', which later became the national song, was written by Bankim Chandra Chatterjee, which he included in his novel 'Anandmath' published in 1882. The term patidar signified people who had obtained clear title to land.

Nadiad is a town halfway between Ahmedabad and Baroda, a distance of 75 miles or 121 kilometres, in Kheda (Kaira) district in Gujarat. The town is named after "nats", the rope dancers. Its historical name is Natapadra or Natpur. The town has close association with number 9. It has 9 villages, 9 lakes, 9 routes/roads exiting out, and 9 step-wells, one on each exit-road.

The Patidars of Nadiad had played a notable role in India's *First War for Independence* of 1857. Jhaverbhai Galabhai Patel, father of Vallabhbhai, a Leva (warrior class) Patidar, belonged to that group, and had participated in that War of Independence. He had joined Rani of Jhansi. After the war, Jhaverbhai was held prisoner by Malharrao Holkar at Indore. One day, playing chess within the sight of his prisoner Jhaverbhai, Holkar was so pleasantly surprised and impressed by Jhaverbhai correcting him whenever he made wrong moves that he granted him freedom.

Jhaverbhai was a farmer having 10-acre of farmland in Karamsad village in Borsad taluka in Kheda district of Gujarat. Karamsad was about five miles from Anand and twelve miles from Nadiad.

Vallabhbhai's mother, Ladba, belonged to Nadiad. Ladba was the second wife of Jhaverbhai, the first having expired, without any issues. They had five sons, Somabhai, Narsinghbhai, Vitthalbhai, Vallabhbhai, and Kasibhai, Vallabhbhai being their fourth son, and a daughter (youngest) named Dahiba.

Vallabhbhai married Jhaverba, and set up his household in Godhra, where he practised law. They were blessed with a daughter, Maniben, in April 1903, and a son, Dahyabhai, in November 1906. Jhaverba was hospitalised in Mumbai for cancer in 1909, but despite successful emergency surgery, she passed away in the hospital. Sardar did not remarry.

# Childhood Anecdotes

Right since childhood Vallabhbhai rebelled against wrong-doing. While in schools, he once learnt a teacher was making illegal gains by selling text-books and stationery in black. He first cautioned the teacher, and when that didn't work, gave a warning. When that too failed, he organised a strike. That did the teacher in.

While Vallabhbhai was in class-VI, a teacher caned a student rather badly, and for little or no fault of his. In those days corporal punishments were common. Vallabhbhai gathered all the classmates and sat on strike against the cruelty. The principal was forced to enquire into the matter, and found Vallabhbhai's complaint justified. The teacher was warned never again to repeat the mistake.

Once, when in school, Vallabhbhai and his classmates remonstrated with their teacher regularly being late for the class. To teach the students a lesson, the teacher assigned homework as a punishment for their impudence. Vallabhbhai, however, came to school the next day without doing the homework given as punishment. The punishment doubled. Upon repeated defiance the punishment grew until it meant doing certain *padas* 200 times! And Vallabhbhai was given the last warning by the teacher. *Padas* in Gujarati mean sums. But, *padas* also mean buffaloes. Next day Vallabhbhai came with the figure 200 written on his slate. When the teacher queried what it meant, Vallabhbhai replied with an innocent

face that hardly had he written 200 on his slate when the *padas* ran away!{Sag}

## "On Childhood" by Sardar Patel

"The Editor has assigned to me one of the most difficult jobs which I have had to perform during a life of heavy responsibilities of various types in different positions. Sitting in this city of weird mixture of the old and the new, it is difficult to switch one's mind back more than three scores of years and recall one's life when one was a child. As a child it always pays to be either the eldest or the youngest. As the eldest, a child is the centre of paternal hopes; as the youngest, he is the object of paternal affection. It is the privilege of the eldest to order about all his younger brothers and sisters. As the youngest one has to bear the brunt of accumulated orders; but at the same time, unless one is particularly unfortunate, one gets accumulated blessings as well as showers of affection. Having been born between these two extremes, I naturally had the usual independence, initiative and resources of a middling. When the time came, I could exercise a will of my own. It was seldom, that I had to take into account the responsibilities which devolve upon the eldest child or the debt of affection which bends the back of the youngest…"

#### Education

Vallabhbhai's initial schooling was in Karamsad. After that he studied in Petlad which had a school that taught English—he lived there independently with several young students who had rented a house, and were managing their own affairs. They cooked their own meals—Vallabhbhai became the organizer. From Petlad he shifted to Nadiad. He soon became a leader there, organising strikes, picketing and demonstrations against injustice. He even campaigned in the municipal elections there in favour of one of his teachers who was a contestant. He was accepted as a helpful, constructive

student leader by his colleagues, juniors and seniors, and even by teachers who sought his help to have their grievances sorted out with the headmaster! Formative years crucially determine the direction in which a person is likely to succeed. Vallabhbhai's early success as a leader, organiser, and decision-taker immensely helped build his confidence, and propelled him forward into a national leader.

In those days, a matriculate could become a lawyer by taking the Pleaders' ('Mukhtari' or Junior Pleader) Examination. Not having the means to finance his higher studies, Vallabhbhai, after completing high school, started working as an assistant to an advocate at Nadiad, and borrowing books from him, engaged in self-study for the examination. He sat for the District Pleaders' Examination in 1900, and cleared it. Soon after, he started his practice in Godhra.

Sardar had been saving money from his practice to be able to go to England for higher studies. In Sardar's own words: "I longed to go overseas to see the people of England who, living 7,000 miles away, were able to rule us for so long. My father had no means to enable me to fulfil my ambitions. I was told that only if I could get 7 to 10 thousand rupees I would be able to proceed to England... I therefore studied very earnestly for my law examination and resolved firmly to save sufficient money for a visit to England."{NDP/11}

When Sardar had saved enough he applied for a pass and a ticket. The same arrived in the name of VJ Patel. The initials of his elder brother Vitthalbhai were also VJ. Vitthalbhai expressed his desire to go instead, remonstrating that the turn of the elder brother came first! Large-hearted Sardar promptly made the sacrifice and allowed his elder brother to go at his (Sardar's) expense. Not only that, Sardar also met Vithalbhai's expenses in England. Vitthalbhai passed in first class, obtaining first rank, and a prize of 50 pounds. He returned from England as barrister in 1908, and started practising in Bombay.

Sardar, thereafter, again started saving up, and when he had collected enough, sailed for England in July 1910 for higher education at age 36. He was so committed and determined to complete his studies as soon as possible, especially since his means

were meagre, that utilising the time on the long journey on ship, he complete Roman Law on the way.

He enrolled at the Middle Temple, one of the Inns of Court, as London's law colleges were called, for a 36-month course.

He had self-financed his travel to England, his stay there, and fee. With his limited means he had to be frugal. He stayed in a modest boarding house in Bayswater. He could not afford to buy all the books needed. He therefore made fullest possible use of the Middle Temple library. He used to be there punctually at nine in the morning when it opened, and remained there till the time of its closure at six in the evening. Even though it was far away from his place of stay—over fifteen kilometres—he used to walk both ways. He was a diligent student. He won a five-pound prize for topping a paper on Equity in 1911. His classmate, Godfrey Davis, who later became Chief Justice of Sindh, too won the prize.

If one was diligent and cleared the terms with honours, it was possible to complete the 36-month, 12-terms (4 per year) course earlier than stipulated. Sardar Patel took advantage of the special concession for the meritorious students getting honours, and appeared for the final examinations in June 1912 after about two years, *obtaining first class with honours, getting first rank, and thus topping the class, and winning a prize of 50 pounds* ! After the examinations, there was an obligatory term of six months and minimum dinners to be done, before he could be called to the Bar, a great honour. The ceremony of being called to the Bar was held with the usual dignity and pomp on 27 January 1913. Members marched in procession. As Patel had obtained the first rank, he was given a position of honour. Sardar returned to India on 13 February 1913.

#### Career

Working as an assistant to an advocate at Nadiad after matriculation was highly educative for Sardar, for he keenly watched all court proceedings, and became thoroughly familiar with the workings of the courts. Sardar Patel minutely observed the tricks the police adopted to trap the innocent, and the way they framed

charges. Patel's sharp mind would discover the hidden loopholes, and help innocents get justice.

After passing the District Pleaders' Examination, Vallabhbhai followed his elder brother, Vithalbhai, to the bar at Godhra in 1900. In 1902, he shifted to Borsad (Balsad), a taluka headquarter, where he practised as a criminal lawyer for nearly eight years, and *built a formidable practice as a most successful criminal lawyer* . *Patel's hallmark was extraordinary thoroughness in preparation of his cases, and supreme confidence in courts verging on audacity* .

Patel practised law in Godhra, Borsad and Anand.

After returning from England, and reaching Bombay on 13 February 1913, Patel contacted the Chief Justice of the High Court Sir Basil Scott, who, after examining Patel's proficiency, offered him the post of a judge. However, Vallabhbhai politely declined, as he wanted to set up his own law practise.

Soon after, Patel settled in Ahmedabad—a smartly-dressed person donning a felt-hat, he impressed everyone at the bar, not just by his turn-out, but by his through professionalism, his skills as a lawyer, and his penetrating cross-examination. His gift of sizing-up persons, correct judgement of people, and quick assessment of adversaries and witnesses, besides his swagger and his bold, fearless, frank, forthright and domineering nature, helped him dominate in his profession, and later in his political career. He soon excelled as a barrister in Ahmedabad, and went on to have a roaring practice. He became the highest paid lawyer in Ahmedabad, arousing envy and awe among others.

While practising in Ahmedabad, Patel donned European-style clothes. He was a regular at the lawyer's club, and became a skilled bridge player.

Nehru was unsuccessful in the profession he was trained in (a lawyer), and could hardly earn any money, despite the strong support and good practice of his father. Both he and his family were dependent upon his father for support. This was in sharp contrast to his adversary like Jinnah who had a roaring legal practice, and was essentially a self-made man. This was also in sharp contrast to his colleagues, Sardar Patel, Dr Rajendra Prasad, Rajaji, and host of

others, who were very successful lawyers earning fat income, and who willingly gave up their practice on the call of Gandhi.

## Elder Brother Vithalbhai

Apart from financing his elder brother's education in England (please see above), Sardar supported Vithalbhai's entry into politics in the Bombay Presidency by taking care of his family in Ahmedabad.

During Sardar's absence from India for studies in England, his elder brother Vithalbhai had taken care of Sardar's two children, Maniben and Dahya. After Sardar returned from England, the two brothers reached a pact: "one of us should serve the country and the other the family". Thereafter, it was Sardar's responsibility to take care of Vithalbhai's family and their expenses. Commented Sardar Patel later: "My brother gave up his flourishing practice and started on a career of public service, while I bore the burden of maintaining the household. I had thus to commit all the sins and he performed all the good deeds; but I reconciled myself with the thought that I could claim at least a share of his good work!"{NDP/22}

Vithalbhai (1873–1933) was the third of five Patel brothers, and was four years elder to Vallabhbhai Patel. He was born in Nadiad in Gujarat, and was raised in Karamsad. He married Diwaliba at a young age. She died in 1915. Vithalbhai remained a widower thereafter.

Vithalbhai studied in London at the Middle Temple Inn, and completed the 36-month course in 30 months. He topped his class, something his younger brother Vallabhbhai repeated later.

Vithalbhai grew up to be a very successful lawyer. When he devoted himself full-time to the cause of freedom, he gave up his thriving law practice.

Unlike his younger brother Vallabhbhai, Vithalbhai was not a devoted follower of Gandhi. After withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation Movement by Gandhi in 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, Vithalbhai left the Congress to co-found the Swaraj Party along with

Chittaranjan Das and Motilal Nehru. Vithalbhai was respected for his wit and oratorical skills. He was an outstanding legislator, and became the first Indian speaker of the Central Assembly.

Vithalbhai rejoined the Congress upon the declaration of Purna Swaraj (Complete Independence) in 1930. He was subsequently imprisoned, but was released in 1931 on health grounds.

However, Vithalbhai left the Congress after the end of the Salt Satyagraha, and became a fierce critic of Gandhi. He became a strong ally of Subhas Chandra Bose. Both Bose and Vithalbhai happened to be in Vienna in 1933 for medical treatment, and came close, their political views being similar. Among other things, they jointly stated: "...as a political leader Mahatma Gandhi has failed.... and a change of leadership is necessary..." Subhas Bose and Vithalbhai travelled together across Europe mobilising funds. They also met the President of Ireland.

Even as Subhas Bose's health improved, unfortunately, Vithalbhai's health took a turn for the worse. When he came to know of the condition, Vallabhbhai wrote several anxious letters to Vithalbhai, but apparently none reached him: Vithalbhai felt neglected. Subhas Bose and colleagues took much care of Vithalbhai. However, he expired in Geneva, Switzerland, on 22 October 1933. His body was flown to India. As Vallabhbhai was then in jail, Vallabhbhai's son, Dahyabhai, performed the last rites.

Before his death, Vithalbhai willed three-fourths of his estate amounting to (at that time) rupees 1,20,000 on 2 October 1933 to Subhas Bose for carrying forward the political work they had jointly embarked upon. A portion of the will read: "The balance of my assets after disposal of the above-mentioned four gifts is to be handed over to Subhas Chandra Bose (son of Janaki Nath Bose) of 1, Woodburn Park, Calcutta, to be spent by the said Subhas Chandra Bose or by his nominee or nominees according to his instructions for the political upliftment of India and preferably for publicity work on behalf of India's cause in other countries."

The will, duly signed by Vithalbhai, was witnessed by three Bengalis, who happened to be in Vienna then: SC Guha, AC Chatterji, and CC Basu. Gordhanbhai Patel was the sole executor of

the will, as the other co-executor, PT Patel, had expired after Vithalbhai's death.

Dispute and doubts on the will were raised on several counts. However, in 1938, Sardar Patel proposed to Subhas Bose, who was then the Congress President, that the disputed money be left to a special committee of the Congress. Bose agreed. But, the two could not agree on who all would be the members of that committee.

Gordhanbhai Patel, the executor of the will, moved Bombay High Court for a ruling on the interpretation of the will in January 1939. Both sides—Subhas Bose and Sardar Patel—engaged lawyers. Justice BJ Wadia finally ruled that the specifics on which Subhas Bose was to spend the money as per the will were vague, hence invalid; and therefore the money should go to the legal heirs of Vithalbhai.

Subhas Bose appealed against the judgement, strongly backed by his brother, Sarat Bose. Chief Justices Beaumont and Kania, however, confirmed Wadia's ruling.

Sardar Patel and family did not use the proceeds for any personal purpose. They created "Vithalbhai Memorial Trust" for charitable purposes, to which all the money (Rs.1,20,000) went. Vallabhbhai had already obtained in writing from all possible legal heirs of Vithalbhai that they would NOT take any money from the proceeds of the estate. {RG2/L-4089-4114}

#### Wife Jhaverba

Jhaverba, wife of Sardar Patel, was born in 1880 in village Gana in Anand district of Gujarat. Her father Desaibhai Patel was a farmer. She married Vallabhbhai in 1892 when the two were respectively 12 and 17 years old. She was diagnosed with cancer and was admitted to Cama Hospital in Mumbai in 1909. Unfortunately, she didn't survive, and died at a young age of 29 on 11 January 1909. At that time, Vallabhbhai was 34 years old, and their daughter Maniben and son Dahyabhai were just 6 and 3 years old respectively. The tragedy devastated Patel's home life. Like his three brothers who too had lost their wives at an early age, Vallabhbhai decided not to

remarry.

#### Daughter Maniben

Maniben Patel, the only daughter of Sardar Patel, was born on 3 April 1903. Her mother, Jhaverba, unfortunately died of cancer in 1909 when Maniben was just 6 years old.

When Sardar Patel left for higher studies for England in 1910, his children remained in Mumbai with his elder brother Vithalbhai at Bandra. Maniben studied in Mumbai at St. Joseph's Convent until 1917. She graduated from Gujarat Vidyapith at Ahmedabad in 1924.

Influenced by Gandhi, she switched to khadi at a tender age of 16, and started working regularly at the Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. Unexpectedly, Maniben and her brother Dahyabhai had switched to khadi even before Sardar had himself done so, even though Sardar had already been Gandhi's second-in-command! The siblings wondered why their father had lagged behind, but never queried him. Sardar switched to khadi a little later in 1921. Most of the garments that Sardar Patel wore after 1921 were woven out of the yarn made by Maniben.

In 1921, just when 17, she put all her gold bangles, earrings and other ornaments, gold wrist-watch, and jewels in a bundle of cloth and, after obtaining her father's nod, deposited them in the cause of freedom at the Gandhi Ashram.

Unlike Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, Maniben was a freedom fighter, who actively participated in the non-cooperation movements. During the Bardoli Satyagraha in 1928, she along with many other ladies helped out in the camps. For her active role in the Salt Satyagraha of 1930 and thereafter she was arrested and imprisoned on several occasions.

During her stint in Sabarmati jail, Sardar Patel wrote to her: "*Look after all the other women prisoners, and see that they come out braver than when they went in* …". {RG2/L-3423}

In January 1932, she was arrested along with Kasturba Gandhi for defying a ban on meetings in Bardoli. She was released in May

1932, but was re-arrested in July 1932 for defying a ban in Kheda, and was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment, which she spent in Belgaum jail.

For her role in arousing people in the villages in Rajkot she was arrested in December 1938. Gandhi was much impressed with her work, and had remarked that Maniben was showing her mettle; and that he [Gandhi] had not seen another daughter like her.

British response to the Congress conditions for cooperation in the war efforts for the Second World War was totally disappointing. That led Gandhi to initiate "Selective", rather than "Mass", Disobedience through select leaders. Each Satyagrahi had to recite the unlawful statement: "It is wrong to help the British war effort with men or money." Participating in the same, Sardar Patel was arrested in November 1940, and was sent to Yerwada jail in Pune; while Maniben was arrested in December 1940 and sent to Belgaum jail. Released in May 1941, she again wished to court arrest, but Gandhi stopped her, looking to her frail health.

Later, Maniben underwent prolonged imprisonment during the Quit India Movement of 1942. She was arrested along with Kasturba Gandhi in August 1942, and was in detention at the Aga Khan's Palace in Pune, where Gandhi was lodged. Maniben was released in March 1944. But, she was rearrested in May 1944 in Bardoli in Gujarat, and was sent to Surat jail. From Surat she was sent to Yerwada jail.

She didn't get married, and served her father till his death in 1950. After Sardar Patel passed away, she worked for various charities, and for the Sardar Patel Memorial Trust till her death in 1990.

She was elected to Lok Sabha as an MP (1952-57) from South Kaira in 1952, and as an MP (1957-62) from Anand in 1957. She was a Rajya Sabha member during 1964-70. She also served as the Secretary of the Gujarat State Congress during 1953-56, and as its Vice-President during 1957-64. She had left Congress(I) to join Congress(O), and had opposed Emergency. She was elected to Lok Sabha from Mehsana on the Janata Party ticket in 1977.

She had meticulously maintained a diary during the freedom

movement, and even after independence, till 1950. The same was published as "*Inside Story of Sardar Patel: The Diary of Maniben Patel, 1936-50* "{Mani} in 2001, after her death.

The following is based on a telling episode about her described by Balraj Krishna{IFJ/9}{BK/494-5} :

Sardar Patel gave up his highly remunerative legal practice when he joined Gandhi in the independence struggle. He kept no property or savings. Even after independence, when he became the Deputy Prime Minister, he and his daughter Maniben continued with their austere life. After a massive heart attack, when Patel was convalescing at the Dehra Dun Circuit House, Mahavir Tyagi visited him. Incidentally, Mahavir Tyagi (1899–1980) was a well-known parliamentarian from Dehra Dun. He was in the British Indian Army and was posted in Persia when he resigned upon the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre of 13 April 1919. He was court-martialled in Quetta, capital of Baluchistan, and externed from Baluchistan with all pay deposits forfeited. Returning home, Tyagi joined the freedom movement.

Seeing Maniben wearing a Khadi sari with a huge patch sewed over a torn portion, Mahavir Tyagi commented in good humour: "Maniben, you think yourself to be 'great', being the daughter of a man who has, within a year, established a farflung 'Empire' [by merging the numerous Princely States]. Not so was [the Empire] of Rama or Krishna, or of Ashoka, Akbar, or of the British! As the daughter of one who is the 'Sardar' of big Rajas and Maharajas, don't you feel ashamed of wearing such a sari?... If you happen to go round my town, people will take you for a beggar and offer you some money." Patel, joining in the fun, remarked: "The bazaar is full of people. By evening she will be able to collect a good amount." Dr Sushila Nayyar intervened: "Tyagi, Maniben spends the whole day in looking after Sardar Saheb. Then she has to find time to write her diary and spin yarn on the charkha. Of the yarn thus spun, clothes are stitched for Sardar Saheb, as he doesn't purchase cloth from Khadi Bhandar. When his dhotis and kurtas are torn, Maniben makes her cloth out of them…"

'*I too had a dream'* —an autobiography of Dr Verghese Kurien of Anand Dairy fame, as told to Gouri Salvi, the author—is a great story full of interesting anecdotes. It is worth reading such real life stories. Among the many interesting episodes in the book, one, rather shocking anecdote relates to Maniben. The anecdote below is based on this book of Kurien{VK1} and other sources.

Sardar Patel's wife, Jhaverba, had expired back in 1909, and he was being looked after by his daughter, Maniben, who chose not to get married. Maniben was a devoted patriot, and a dedicated Congress worker, who gave her all to the nation, and to the Freedom Struggle. Sardar Patel did not have any bank balances or property. Even though he was earning substantially as a very successful lawyer, once he got into the Freedom Movement, he gave up everything. Sardar was the very example of Gandhian simplicity. He used to say that, "Bapu has told that those in politics should not hold property, and I hold none." Such were the ideals then. Contrast this with the multi-crorepati leaders of today. When Sardar Patel expired, he had left nothing for his daughter. With Sardar no more, she had to vacate the house. She was left all alone to fend for herself, with no money and no house. Sardar had instructed her to give a bag and a book to Nehru upon his death.

After Sardar's death—which happened in Mumbai—Maniben dutifully went to Delhi, took an appointment with Nehru and met him. She handed over to him the bag and the book. It seems the book was an account book, and the bag contained rupees 35 lacs. After having done so, she waited for Nehru to express sympathy, enquire as to what she intended doing, where would she stay, her monetary position, whether she wanted anything, and what he could do for her. But, Nehru showed no interest and said nothing. After some time, she left disappointed.

She returned to Ahmedabad to stay with a cousin. Neither Nehru, nor the Congress Party bothered about her well-being. Such was the fate of the lady who gave her all to the nation and of the daughter of a person who made India what it is today! Contrast this with the

Nehru Dynasty, who enjoyed all the fruits, while others had done all the sacrifices.

## Son Dahyabhai Patel

Dahyabhai Patel (1906–1973), the only son of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was educated in Bombay and Gujarat, and graduated from Gujarat Vidyapith, Ahmedabad. Like his sister, Dahyabhai was also a freedom fighter. He took part in the Quit India movement, and was imprisoned between 1942 to 1944.

Dahyabhai married Yashoda in 1925. The marriage was solemnised in Gandhi Ashram in Ahmedabad. They had a son, Bipin, who was born in 1927. Yashoda expired early, in 1932. Dahyabhai later remarried, and had another son, Gautam, through his second wife Bhanumati. While Maniben used to spin cloth for him, Sardar Patel was dependent upon his son Dahyabhai for his modest expenses, and used to stay with him when in Mumbai.

Dahyabhai initially worked for an insurance company, and later became a businessman. He had a flat in Prabhadevi, Mumbai. He shifted to Opera House in 1937, and then to Hem Prabha on Marine Drive. Post-independence, he won elections to the Lok Sabha in 1957 and 1962. He also served in the Rajya Sabha.

Unlike Nehru, Sardar Patel was totally non-nepotistic. He had told Dahyabhai and Dahyabhai's son, when they visited him [Sardar Patel] after he suffered a heart-attack in Delhi after independence : "As long as I am in this chair, don't visit Delhi, unless I am unwell and you have to see me...All sorts of people will contact you. Take care."{RG/473}

## To Heavenly Abode

Sardar Patel's health began to deteriorate from the second week of November 1950. By the first week of December 1950 he had realised his end was near. His daughter Maniben heard him repeat periodically: "*Zindagi ka ye tamasha chand roz* ".{RG/531}

Doctors advised Patel should move to milder weather of Mumbai; and he was accordingly flown to Mumbai on 12 December 1950. He was taken to Birla House at Malabar Hill and put under oxygen. He remained in considerable pain.

A little before 3am on Friday, 15 December 1950 he suffered a heart attack, and lost consciousness. Revived after several hours, he sipped some water, but again lost consciousness. He breathed his last at 9.37am.

A long stream of people paid their last respects to him at Birla House. Milling crowds witnessed his cortege to the cremation ground. He was cremated the same day evening at Sonapur. His wife, Zhaverba, and his elder brother, Vithalbhai, too had been cremated there. His son Dahyabhai lit the fire. Nehru, Rajaji and President Rajendra Prasad flew in to attend the funeral.

Dr Rajendra Prasad spoke on the occasion: "*Sardar's body is being consumed by fire, but no fire on earth can consume his fame. We grieve for ourselves, not for him* ."{RG/533} Said Rajaji: "*What inspiration, courage, confidence and force incarnate Vallabhbhai was! We will not see the like of him again* ."{RG/533}
