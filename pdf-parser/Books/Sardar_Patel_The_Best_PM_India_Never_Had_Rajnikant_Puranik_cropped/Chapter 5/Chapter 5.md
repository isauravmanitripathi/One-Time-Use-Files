#### Feb–1947: Attlee's "Quit India" Deadline Declaration

On 20 February 1947 the British PM Clement Attlee announced that Britain would quit India by June 1948. He also announced: "HMG will have to consider to whom the powers of the Central Government in British India should be handed over on the due date, whether as a whole to some form of Central Government for British India, or in some areas to the existing provincial governments, or in such other way as may seem most reasonable and in the best interests of the Indian people."

The hint was for partition and Pakistan. Former Secretary of State of India, Samuel John Gurney Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood, commented that Attlee's declaration was an "unconditional surrender, at the expense of many to whom we have given specific pledges for generations past, which would lead to a division of India under the worst possible circumstances" and that it would "imperil the peace and prosperity of India".{VPM2/340/L-6446}

While Patel maintained his discreet silence on Attlee's declaration, intriguingly, Nehru termed it as "wise and courageous"{SG2/337} , even though it was an invitation to anarchy and chaos, as became apparent very soon.

# 22 March 1947: Mountbatten Arrives

Lord Mountbatten, the new Viceroy, arrived in India on 22 March 1947 and took charge two days later. In the course of his first speech, he said that his was not a normal viceroyalty. The British Government were resolved to transfer power by June 1948 and a solution had to be found in a few months' time.

# April 1947: Gandhi's PM Offer for Jinnah

To explore the possibility of averting partition, Gandhi had made the following proposal to Mountbatten on 1 April 1947: Dissolution of Interim Government then headed by Nehru. Inviting Jinnah to take over. Allowing Jinnah to form a cabinet of his choice. If Jinnah ran the government in India's interest, the Congress would continue to cooperate with him, and not use its majority to thwart him. Who would decide if Jinnah was running the government in India's interest? Not Congress or Gandhi, but Mountbatten! Further, Jinnah could continue to advocate Pakistan—but peacefully!!

Absurd proposal! But, that was Mahatma. Who gave authority to Gandhi to condemn the majority to the mercy of the minority, and the Muslim League. What were the credentials of Jinnah and the Muslim League that they could be entrusted with the fate of the majority? Why would Mountbatten decide whether or not Jinnah was running the government in India's interest? Was Mountbatten an impartial observer? Didn't he represent India's tormentors of two centuries? Wasn't Gandhi aware that Mountbatten was there to safeguard and advance the interests of Britain, and not of India? Even assuming Mountbatten was an impartial observer, was he competent to determine what really was in the interest of India? Even if he were both impartial and competent, how long was he to remain in India to act as a referee? What sort of self-respect was it if those "fighting" for India's freedom were to depend upon a representative of the power from whom they were seeking freedom to act as a referee and adjudicate what was in India's interest? Taken aback by Gandhi's extraordinary proposal, Mountbatten sought Gandhi's permission to discuss the proposal with Nehru and Maulana Azad in confidence. Gandhi agreed. Mountbatten didn't include Patel with Nehru and Azad. He knew Patel would dismiss it as a fantastic nonsense.

Gandhi repeated his proposal to Mountbatten the next day on 2 April 1947. Mountbatten told him he was interested in the proposal when Gandhi asked him specifically if he supported it. Gandhi advised Mountbatten he would try to persuade the Congress to accept it, and would tour India for support.

Shortly after the above meeting, Mountbatten met Maulana Azad,

who not only expressed his approval for Gandhi's proposal, but was enthusiastic about it, and encouraged Mountbatten to get Jinnah to accept it. Maulana Azad generally used to be in favour of anything that gave more weightage and power to Muslims.

Having favoured Nehru undemocratically—overriding the 80% support of the PCCs for Patel—with the post of PM, Gandhi had expected to bring Nehru to his side. Gandhi should have known that a person like Nehru who unabashedly demanded to be anointed PM most undemocratically—not a single PCC had voted in his favour for the sake of power could not be expected to yield his position to Jinnah. Although Mountbatten deployed people to talk to Nehru to dissuade him from accepting Gandhi's plan should he be so persuaded, the same was really not necessary.

Curiously, Mountbatten never discussed Gandhi's plan with the person Gandhi wanted to hand over power to: Jinnah. In a meeting, Mountbatten had only indirectly mentioned his wish of seeing Jinnah as PM, something about which Jinnah showed keen eagerness; but Mountbatten did not deliberate on the matter further. Gandhi & Co failed to appreciate the simple fact that Mountbatten was no dogooder for India, he was HMG's representative, and HMG had a vested interest in the partition of India. No wonder Mountbatten would have exerted his all to ensure Gandhi's scheme never succeeded.

It makes one's heart sink, and leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, to find that our top freedom fighters were not really fighters, but pleaders with their adversaries, and dependent on their "good-will", their "fairness", their "sense of justice", their "commitment to what was good for India", and their "empathy" to deliver us in one-piece, and in good shape, from their clutches!

As expected, Patel had firmly opposed the plan. Patel hated Muslim appeasement. Being a wise and practical person, Patel also knew that given the embittered and surcharged atmosphere there was no way Hindus would tolerate or suffer Muslim rule.

On the evening of 10 April 1947. Nehru, Patel and many members of the CWC met Gandhi and told him they were opposed to his plan. Only Badshah Ghaffar Khan supported Gandhi. On 11

April 1947 Gandhi advised Mountbatten of his defeat vis-à-vis the plan, and left Delhi. Rajaji noted in his diary entry on 13 April 1947: "*Gandhiji's ill-conceived plan of solving the present difficulties was objected to by everybody and scotched* ."{RG3/270}

# May 1947: Mountbatten's Initial Plan that Failed

Just over a month into his job, Mountbatten prepared a plan for Britain to quit India, and sent it to London with Ismay and Abell on 2 May 1947. He moved to Shimla in summer, and invited Nehru there with a view to get him on his side. On 10 May 1947 Mountbatten received back his plan from London, revised and approved. Full of hope and enthusiasm, Mountbatten showed the plan to Nehru.

The outline of the plan was to transfer power to the provinces or groups of provinces for an interim period, who would then decide whether to join India or Pakistan or remain independent. Some kind of central authority would be formed to deal with overall defence. Members of the Legislative Assemblies of Bengal and Punjab would decide whether or not to partition their respective provinces. The plan also envisaged holding re-election in NWFP.

When shown, VP Menon had expressed his disapproval for the plan. Menon was against giving initial independence to the provinces or to their groups. A patriot, he had even stated that if the plan was accepted, he would resign.

Nehru's reaction to the plan was fortunately negative. Nehru opined the plan would adversely affect Central Authority, provoke civil conflict and unrest, and would give a fillip to the Balkanisation of India, resulting in multiple Ulsters. Having assured London he would bring Nehru over to his side on the plan (What was the source of his confidence?), Mountbatten faced deep embarrassment. With his buoyancy punctured, Mountbatten desperately looked for a way out.

# Patel & Partition, the Lesser Evil

Patel realised that governing India along with the Muslim League would be a nightmare. To placate the Muslim League, Sir Norman Smith had offered a wild solution: 7 seats in the Council to the League against 6 of the Congress! Patel had responded to Smith: "*If you think that generosity will placate the Muslim Oliver Twist then*

*you do not understand either the Muslim mind or the situation* ."{RG/387}

Patel had stated to Sir Richard Stafford Cripps on 15 December 1946:

"If strong action had been taken or allowed to be taken, when Direct Action Day was fixed by the Muslim League, all this colossal loss of life and property and the blood-curling events would not have happened. The Viceroy took the contrary view and every action of his since the Great Calcutta Killing has been in the direction of encouraging the Muslim League and putting pressure on us towards appeasement."{RG2/L-6664}

Having experienced the machinations of the Muslim League in the Interim Government, Sardar Patel rightly concluded it was not possible to govern the country jointly with the Muslim League then or in future. He realised the inevitability of the Partition around December 1946, and was perhaps the first tall Congress leader to do so, apart from CR (Rajaji), who had expressed such a possibility long ago. It took Congress another six months to reach the same conclusion.

VP Menon had outlined to Patel in late December 1946 a scheme of partition, transfer of power and Dominion Status to which Patel had responded positively. Partition was to save India from civil war; while the Dominion Status would ensure the British cooperation in smooth transfer of power, particularly with the military under their command.

Concluding there would not be peace in united Punjab, and no place for them, Hindus and Sikhs demanded East Punjab. Seizing the opportunity, and as a rebuff to the League, Patel promptly agreed to the demand for partition of Punjab, and of Bengal, by implication. Other Congress leaders agreed, and on 8 March 1947 the CWC proposed the same. Jinnah and the Muslim League, who had coveted the whole of Punjab and Bengal as part of Pakistan, irretrievably lost East Punjab by their ill-thought violent act. The CWC resolution meant the Congress was ready to yield Pakistan. Earlier, on 4 March 1947, Patel had written to Jinnah's close friend K Dwarkadas: "*If the League insists on Pakistan, the only alternative is*

*the division of Punjab and Bengal* ."{RG/390}

The above initiative for partition taken by Patel, and Patel's ensuring the necessary resolution was passed as above on 8 March 1947 by the CWC came as a bolt from the blue for Gandhi. Gandhi was not consulted.

*Wrote Gandhi to Patel:* "Try to explain to me your Punjab resolution if you can. I cannot understand it."

*Responded Patel:* "It is difficult to explain to you the resolution on Punjab. It was adopted after the deepest deliberation. Nothing has been done in a hurry, or without a full thought. That you have expressed your views against it, we learnt from the papers. But you are, of course, entitled to say what you feel right."{BK2/80}

The resolution indeed was the only answer to Jinnah demanding partition, for it meant he would neither get full Punjab, nor full Bengal, and not Assam either. But for Patel and the resolution he sponsored, the vicious stalemate that had gone on for too long would not have been broken. Patel had firmed up his resolve to get as much territory for India as possible, and to totally frustrate Jinnah's grand design of a large Pakistan with full Punjab, full Bengal and Assam—Jinnah ultimately got what he himself admitted: "*moth-eaten Pakistan* ".{RG3/248} Patel had also hoped that confronted with the crumbs of "*truncated and moth-eaten Pakistan* ", Jinnah might still desist from demanding partition. It was like catching the bull by the horns.

Patel got the above resolution passed also to checkmate Gandhi lest he came up with some harmful appeasement move, or a move of some 'large-hearted' surrender.

Patel had grasped that continued resistance to partition and Pakistan would only mean further spread of communal strife and riots, cleavages within even the police force and the army leading to a situation that would have further favoured Jinnah's and British interests, and might have lead to whole of Group-B and Group-C becoming Pakistan.

Back in the sixteenth century, Tulsi Das had given his pearl of wisdom: "Budh ardh tajain, lukh sarvasa jata"—*realising that the whole would go, the wise surrender half* .

In the event, India surrendered only one-fourth, and retained three-fourth! Although Pakistan had been claiming the whole of Assam, Bengal and Punjab; India retained the whole of Assam (but for one district), while forcing partition of Bengal and Punjab.

Sardar Patel was the first prominent Indian leader who agreed to go in for the partition. The initial concurrence for the Partition was on 10 May 1947. It demonstrated his decisiveness, ability to take unpleasant, but necessary decisions, and high order of statesmanship. On 11 May 1947, while Acharya Kripalani confessed, "*When we are faced with thorny problems, and Gandhi's advice is not available, we consider Sardar Patel as our leader* " {RG/400} ; Sarojini Naidu had stated that Sardar Patel was "*the man of decision and the man of action in our counsels* " {RG/400} . It was Sardar who convinced the rest on the wisdom of partition.

The CWC ratified Patel and Nehru's acceptance of the partition plan on 2 June 1947 by 157 votes to 27, with 32 remaining neutral. Sardar Patel delivered a key note address at the CWC as under:

"I fully appreciate the fears of our brothers from [the Muslimmajority areas]. Nobody likes the division of India and my heart is heavy. But the choice is between one division and many divisions. We must face facts, cannot give in to emotionalism and sentimentality. The Working Committee has not acted out of fear. But I am afraid that all our toil and hard work of these many years might go waste and prove unfruitful. My nine months in office have completely disillusioned me regarding the supposed merits of the Cabinet Mission Plan. Except for a few honourable exceptions, Muslim officials from top to bottom are working for the League. The communal veto given to the League in the mission plan would have blocked India's progress at every stage. Whether or not we like it, de facto Pakistan already exists in Punjab and Bengal. Under the circumstances I would prefer a de jure Pakistan which may make the League more responsible. Freedom is coming. We have 75 to 80 % of India, which we can make strong with our genius. The League can develop the rest of the country."{RG/403}

Patel Refuses East-West Corridor to Jinnah, 30 May 1947

Unlike Nehru, Sardar Patel was very firm in his dealings. Writes Rajmohan Gandhi in his book 'Patel–A Life': "Returning from London on the night of May 30, Mountbatten, in his own words, 'sent V.P.Menon to see Patel to obtain his agreement to six months joint control [with Pakistan] of Calcutta', which is what Jinnah had been pressing for. The Viceroy recorded Patel's reply: '*Not even for six hours!* ' Earlier...Jinnah had demanded an 800-mile 'corridor' to link West and East Pakistan. Patel called the claim '*such fantastic nonsense as not to be taken seriously* '. It died a quick and unremembered death."

# VP Menon–Mountbatten Plan, June 1947

VP Menon, the Constitutional Adviser and Political Reforms Commissioner to the Viceroy, came to Mountbatten's rescue, and suggested a way out for the British to transfer power. He gave Mountbatten an outline for transfer of power that he had prepared earlier, but which was not favourably seen by the authorities prior to Mountbatten.

Menon's scheme, prepared in 1946, envisaged transfer of power by the British to two Central Governments on Dominion basis, and separation of the Muslim-majority areas from India.

During December 1946–January 1947 Menon had discussed the matter with Sardar Patel. Menon had opined that a unitary India under the Cabinet Mission Plan was an illusion; and the proposed 3 tier constitution would be unwieldy and difficult to work. It was better for the country to be divided than gravitate towards civil war. Menon had suggested that the best solution was partition and transfer of power to two central governments based on the Dominion Status; the advantages being (a)avoidance of civil war; (b)peaceful transfer of power; (c)greater likelihood of its acceptance in Britain, particularly by the Conservatives like Churchill on account of the "Dominion Status", and membership of the two dominions in the Commonwealth; (d)continued services of the British bureaucracy and the British army officers during the transitional period; (e)reassurance to the Princes on continuity, and better possibility of their peaceful merger with either of the two dominions; (f)strong

central governments for each of the dominions to guard against centrifugal forces; and (g)facilitation for framing a constitution unhampered by communal and provincial/regional considerations. Sardar Patel had given Menon a positive response.

Mountbatten and Nehru broadly agreed with Menon's outline of the scheme, and asked him to prepare a draft plan. Knowing that without Patel's backing the plan would be a non-starter, Menon sent an advance copy of the plan to Patel. Patel's response was expectedly positive, for the plan had his pre-approval. On Nehru's hang-ups on membership of the Commonwealth as a condition in the plan, Patel assured Nehru that he would take care that the plan was approved by the Congress, provided the other conditions were met. Patel knew the Commonwealth-condition was put to satisfy conservatives like Churchill, and obtain their approval for the passage of the Indian Independence Bill. All that Patel wanted assurance for was that the British parliament pass a bill to grant independence to India, and that the British actually quit within two months; and importantly, while they let the paramountcy for the Indian Princely States lapse, they don't interfere or take sides on their merger with India.

Jinnah, as usual, did act difficult, and stipulated additional conditions, including the wild one like an 800-mile corridor to link East and West Pakistan; but his tantrums didn't work, and he had to ultimately agree to what Mountbatten (or rather, VP Menon) had proposed, and what the Congress was agreeable to. Why that change in Jinnah? With their goal (Pakistan) achieved, Jinnah's mentors in London like Churchill (who had propped him up to get Pakistan as it was in the strategic interests of the British) conveyed to him to not act difficult any more, as he couldn't get more than what was on offer.

Apprehensive that Gandhi may yet come in the way of the partition plan, Mountbatten personally met Gandhi to explain the position. Gandhi accepted the position.

Mountbatten announced the Partition Plan, 3 June 1947 The CWC ratified Patel and Nehru's acceptance of the partition plan on 2 June 1947 by 157 votes to 27, with 32 remaining neutral.

On 3 June 1947, Mountbatten announced the Partition Plan: Power to be relinquished to the two Governments of India and Pakistan on the basis of Dominion Status by 15 August 1947, much earlier than the original date of June 1948. In regard to the Princely States, the plan laid down that the policy of His Majesty's Government towards the Indian Princely States contained in the Cabinet Mission memorandum of 12 May 1946 would remained unchanged—the British paramountcy would lapse, and their status would revert to what it was before.

On the night of 3 June 1947, Nehru, Jinnah and Baldev Singh on behalf of the Congress, AIML, and Sikhs respectively aired their acceptance of the VP Menon-Mountbatten Partition Plan. Jinnah was not happy with the truncated Pakistan that he was getting, but when Mountbatten firmly told him he could get no more, and that the only alternative was united India, Jinnah agreed.

Mountbatten wrote to his mother on 14 June 1947: "I must stress the importance of Patel in the agreements so far reached. He has a rough exterior and an uncompromising manner… he has never wavered and has stood firm against inner voices and neutral indecisions that have sometimes afflicted his colleagues. Patel's realism has also been a big factor in the acceptance of the Dominion Status formula."{ACJ/136/L-2430}

#### June 1947: AICC Meet to Ratify Partition

Although Gandhiji had hang-ups, most of the top leadership of the Congress had realised the inevitability of the Partition. Gandhiji had told the CWC on 2 June 1946 when it took the decision in favour of Partition that although he disagreed, he will not stand in the way. Gandhi had earlier commented:

"Today I find myself all alone. Even the Sardar and Jawaharlal think that my reading is wrong and peace is sure to return if partition is agreed upon... They did not like my telling the Viceroy that even if there was to be partition, it should not be through British intervention... They wonder if I have not deteriorated with age."{RG/401}

Patel had himself admitted:

"For several years, Gandhi and I were in perfect agreement.

Mostly we agreed instinctively; but when the time for a big decision on the question of India's independence came, we differed. I felt that we had to take independence there and then. We had, therefore, to agree to partition. I came to this conclusion after a great deal of heart-searching and with a great deal of sorrow. But I felt that if we did not accept partition, India would be split into many bits and completely ruined."{ISS1} {NS/90}

Gandhi's role as a guide, or the one with a veto-power, had ended long back. Much earlier when he had expressed his wish to quit, none in the CWC had asked him not to do so.

Gandhi told Durga Das in 1946:

"When I met him [Gandhi], he said there was too much deceit all round and added that Patel and Rajen Babu (Rajendra Prasad) had ceased to be his 'yes man'."{DD/226}

But, Gandhi had finally acquiesced to the Partition. Perhaps he also took into account the alternate consequence Patel reportedly talked of:

"It is a question of civil war or partition. As for civil war, no one can say where it will start and where it will end. True, the Hindus might win in the end but only after paying an unpredictable and huge price."{RG/401}

Indeed, the Muslim League call for Pakistan and partition could only have been resisted if the Congress was prepared for a strong, sustained retaliatory violence, and a long drawn-out communal strife in cities, towns and villages. However, that was apparently beyond the Congress leadership brought up on Gandhian non-violence. The Congress leadership was incapable of American style civil war. If Netaji Subhas had been there, one could have thought about it.

It is also worth noting that the Hindus and Sikhs of East Punjab and the Hindus of West Bengal had openly demanded partition. Gandhiji had himself admitted in his prayer meeting on 10 June 1947 that as "non-Muslim India is overwhelmingly in favour of partition", he "could not coerce public opinion."{RG/401}

The AICC met on 14 June 1947 to consider and ratify the CWC decision in favour of partition. There were voices against the

partition. When Nehru and Patel failed to persuade some members, Gandhi intervened and appealed to members to support the CWC and its decision for partition, in the absence of an alternative.

Gandhi advised that political realism demanded acceptance of the Mountbatten Plan, and acceptance of the partitionresolution moved by Pandit Govind Ballabh Pant. While 29 voted for the resolution, 15 voted against—notwithstanding Gandhi's appeal to vote in favour of the resolution.{Azad/215}

A senior leader who stood out against partition, and voted against the Pant resolution, was *Purshottamdas Tandon* . He stated he was prepared to suffer the British rule a little longer than pay the heavy price of partition. He claimed the Nehru government had been intimidated by the Muslim League. He got a huge applause when at the end of his speech he said: "*Let us fight both the British and the [Muslim] League* ."{DD/248}

Wrote Maulana Azad:

"…Gandhi's conversion to the Mountbatten [Partition] Plan had been a cause of surprise and regret to me. He now spoke openly in the Working Committee [CWC] in favour of partition."{Azad/210}

# Diabolical League–British Design

Groupings, Partition & Pakistan

The British and the Muslim had started working in tandem to ensure partition and Pakistan, and to make as large a Pakistan as possible—as per the "16 May 1946 *Cabinet Mission Plan* " groupings, where *Group-B (* Punjab, Sindh, NWFP, Baluchistan), combined with *Group-C* (Assam and Bengal) could form Pakistan; leaving just *Group-A* (Madras, UP, Central provinces, Bombay, Bihar and Orissa) for India.

The achievement of the same required practical proof on the ground that Muslims and Hindus cannot live together, and that Muslims dominated those provinces. That required violence and riots —Jinnah and the Muslim League were willing to invest on that; and

the British were willing to look the other way when that happens. Gandhians were for non-violence, and hence for non-retaliation. That suited both the adversaries—the Muslim League and the British tremendously. The British, of course, had all along been highly grateful to Gandhi for his guiding political principle of non-violence, and had, in gratitude, helped elevate him to the status of 'Mahatma'.

Ghaznafar Ali of the Muslim League had stated: "Mohammad Bin Qasim and Mahmud of Ghazni invaded India with armies composed of only a few thousands, and yet were able to overpower lakhs of Hindus. God willing, a few lakhs of Muslims will yet overwhelm crores of Hindus."

# Jinnah's Absurd 'Logic'

On one hand Jinnah had been arguing for and justifying Pakistan on the plea that Hindus and Muslims formed two nations, and that they couldn't live together; while on the other hand he wanted the whole of Group-B *(* Punjab, Sindh, NWFP, Baluchistan) and Group-C (Assam and Bengal) provinces to form Pakistan; leaving just Group-A (Madras, UP, Central provinces, Bombay, Bihar and Orissa) for India. If Hindus and Muslims formed two nations, and they could not live together, as Jinnah argued, why would Hindu-majority Assam go to form Pakistan; and how were Hindus to live with Muslims in undivided Punjab and Bengal?

When Mountbatten brought up the issue of partition of Punjab and Bengal, Jinnah advanced the counter-logic that the Hindus of Punjab and Bengal were respectively first Punjabis and Bengalis rather than being Hindus or Congressis, and therefore the provinces could not be divided, and the whole of them should form Pakistan. Mountbatten promptly pointed out the contradictions in Jinnah's argument, telling him that if his logic were to be accepted there could be no case for Pakistan too! "I am afraid I drove the old gentleman quite mad," reported Mountbatten jovially, "because whichever was his argument went I always pursued it to a stage beyond which he did not wish it to go."{Tunz/182-3}

#### Bengal

Jinnah and Muslim League's diabolical design behind the

Calcutta riots was to somehow make Calcutta a Muslim-majority city, and ensure its inclusion in Pakistan. The idea was to force exodus of Hindus out of Calcutta, trigger counter-riots against Muslims in Bihar, and thus force migration of Muslims out of Bihar, and into Calcutta, increasing its Muslim population.

The riots spread to Bihar, UP, Punjab and NWFP. It all suited Jinnah: Hindus and Muslims can't live together; Pakistan must be granted. The British didn't bother much to quell the riots. They watched bemused—happy to let the world know what would happen without them. Further, the British had a vested interest in the creation of Pakistan; and they were delighted the ground was being readied for the purpose.

Law and order was a provincial matter, and Bengal was under the majority control of the Muslim League, which, rather than quelling riots, was instigating it. Sardar Patel as Home Minister in the Interim Government asked for central takeover of the areas, but the demand was rejected by Viceroy Wavell. Patel wrote to Viceroy Wavell on 25 October 1946: "It would indeed be a tragic paradox if we who have undertaken the responsibility of the Government of India should be powerless to do anything to terminate the reign of terror."

The British were blatantly favouring the Muslim League over the Congress. This became further obvious when Viceroy Wavell, who remained blind to the riots in Calcutta and Noakhali in Bengal, promptly sent his Deputy Private Secretary Ian Scott on a mission to enquire into the riots in Bihar, where the Provincial Government was under the Congress. Significantly, Jinnah issued a press-statement on 26 November 1946 in the context of the Bihar riots asking for "Transfer of Population": transfer of Muslims out of Bihar. Ian Scott conveniently suggested Bengal as the location of the Muslim evacuee camps. The Muslim League and the British administration were working in tandem to ensure Bengal became Pakistan!

Both the British and the Muslim League wanted the riots and chaos to spread across Bengal, Assam, Punjab, Sind, NWFP, and other areas. More the chaos and riots, more the justification for partition and Pakistan. When Patel insisted with Viceroy Wavell for enforcement of Martial Law in disturbed areas, Wavell refused

saying it was not necessary!

When the question of partition of Bengal and Punjab rose, Jinnah pleaded with Mountbatten "not to destroy the unity of Bengal and Punjab, which had national characteristics in common: common history, common ways of life, common language, and where Hindus have stronger feelings as Bengalis or Punjabis than they have as members of the Congress." In saying so, Jinnah apparently missed the irony that his logic also went against the logic of Pakistan!

Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (1892–1963), the then premier of Bengal, who had been responsible for the Calcutta Killings of 1946, was desperate to avoid any partition of Bengal, for he had ambition to head Group-C, Bengal plus Assam, as a separate nation. He had the backing of the British Governor, and had also secured the backing of the Congress Leaders, Sarat Chandra Bose and Kiran Shankar Ray, who desired an undivided Bengal. Kiran Shankar Ray was from East Bengal, and was leader of the Congress in the Bengal Legislative Assembly. Suhrawardy even proceeded to threaten those who supported division, and stated that "Calcutta will be sacked and burnt in case the partition idea is favoured."{Das/113}

Given such a situation, Dr Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and KC Neogy beseeched Sardar Patel: "…all our eyes are turned towards you in the hope that you will not fail to take whatever action is possible to save Bengal and Calcutta from utter ruin and bloodshed."{DD2/39}

Patel responded: "Bengal cannot be isolated from the Indian Union. Talk of the idea of a sovereign republic of independent Bengal is a trap to induce the unwary and unwise to enter into the parlour of the Muslim League. The Congress Working Committee is fully aware of the situation in Bengal. Bengal has got to be partitioned if the non-Muslim population is to survive."{DD2/43}

Patel thereafter wrote to both Sarat Chandra Bose and Kiran Shankar Ray. It had the desired effect. Jinnah, rattled by the Congress demand for partition of Bengal and Punjab, called it a "sinister move actuated by spite and bitterness."{VPM2/355}

# Nehru–Liaquat Pact 1950

With indescribable atrocities against Hindus in East Bengal going

unabated, the GoI made an appeal to Pakistan to call a halt on the same. But, there was little response.

It is worth noting in this connection that Gandhian non-violent principles yielded NOTHING. It was only tit-for-tat that brought Pakistan to the negotiating table.

In Rajlakshmi Debi's Bangla novel Kamal-lata, quoted by Tathagata Roy in his book 'My People, Uprooted: A Saga of the Hindus of Eastern Bengal' (Chapter 6), there is a conversation described between a Hindu from Mymensingh town and a Muslim from a Calcutta suburb sometime just after partition. In the process of haggling the Muslim says "*Excuse me, but your position and ours are not the same. So long as Mahatma Gandhi is alive we have no fears. But you won't be able to live here [East Bengal] much longer* ."

There was a marked difference between Punjab and Bengal in respect of the partition. In Punjab, the carnage was on both sides, East Punjab and West Punjab, although more in the Muslimdominated West Punjab. In Bengal, the mayhem was mostly in the Muslim-dominated East Bengal. In Punjab, the migration was both ways: Muslims migrating from East Punjab in India to Pakistan, and Hindus migrating from Pakistan to East Punjab in India. In a way, there was a population transfer between West Punjab and East Punjab. In Bengal, the predominant migration was that of Hindus from East Bengal/Pakistan to West Bengal/India. There was a reverse migration of Muslims too, but comparatively far less.

However, the continued violence against the Hindus in East Bengal had begun provoking retaliation in West Bengal. For example, the anti-Muslim riots in Howrah turned serious from 26 March 1950 onwards, leading to the beginning of migration of Muslims from West Bengal to East Bengal by March 1950. That is, the population transfer that had happened in Punjab in 1947-48 began to happen in Bengal belatedly by March 1950. It is this which alarmed Pakistan and the Muslim League leaders, who had hitherto been inciting the mobs in East Bengal, and were happy at Hindus being at the receiving end.

It was only when the anti-Muslim riots in Howrah, in retaliation of the on-going carnage in East Bengal, took a serious turn from 26

March 1950 onwards that the Pakistan PM Liaquat Ali made his first conciliatory gesture in a speech at Karachi on 29 March 1950, and expressed his intention to travel to New Delhi on 2 April 1950 to work out a solution with Nehru.

Liaquat Ali hurried to New Delhi on 2 April 1950, and signed the Nehru–Liaquat Pact, also called the Delhi Pact, on 8 April 1950. It provided for safety of refugees when they returned to dispose of their property; return of abducted women and looted property; derecognition of forced conversions; complete and equal right of citizenship and security of life and properties to minorities; and setting up of Minority Commission in each country.

As expected, while India firmly implemented the Pact, not Pakistan. While the anti-Muslim violence in West Bengal was put down with a firm hand, and the migration of Muslims from West Bengal to East Bengal ceased; the violence against the Hindus in East Bengal continued unabated, so also the migration of Hindus from East Bengal to West Bengal. That is, the carnage became only one-sided: that of Hindus in East Bengal. Also, the migration became only one way: Pakistan to India.

Looking to the track-record of the Muslim League leaders, who had themselves been inciting the mobs, Nehru should have known what the result of the pact would be. *Sardar Patel was unhappy with the Pact, but being in the cabinet, didn't oppose it. However, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and KC Niyogee, the two central ministers from West Bengal, immediately resigned from the Union Cabinet in protest against the Pact.*

Rather than facilitating transfer of population between West and East Bengal, and removing forever the problem and the poison, Nehru extracted the following "benefits" for India from the Nehru-Liaquat pact: (1)Checked depletion of Muslim population from West Bengal and Assam by stopping their migration to Pakistan. (2)Increased the population of Muslims in West Bengal and Assam by allowing their reverse migration—allowing Muslims to return who had migrated. (3)Allowed fresh migration of Muslims from East Bengal. (5)Condemned the Hindus in East Bengal (a)to violence, (b)to second-class status, and (c)to remain at the mercy of Muslims.

(6)Forced subsequent migration of Hindus from East Bengal to West Bengal (as the atrocities did not subside in Pakistan).

#### Punjab

Attlee's announcement on 20 February 1947 of quitting India by June 1948 led to uncertainty in Punjab. Barely days after—from 2 March 1947—cadres of the Muslim League at the provocation of its leaders began to hoist League flag over government buildings and demonstrating against the Punjab Premier Khizr Hyat Khan of the Unionist Party (ruling Punjab in coalition with the Congress) who was seen as inimical to the interests of the Muslims and the Muslim League.

The Muslim League unleashed Calcutta-type Direct Action in several cities in Punjab. Riots started. Markets in Lahore and Amritsar were set ablaze. League-provoked mobs of several thousand equipped with guns, and led by demobilised (after the World War-II) Muslim soldiers, attacked defenceless Hindus and Sikhs in cities, towns and villages, particularly in West Punjab, and perpetrated unspeakable atrocities on men, women and children. Thousands were killed. Significantly, while little action was taken against the Muslim mobs, and the Muslim League agitators, who had been spreading chaos and indulging in riots, rapes, killings and mayhem for over a month, the police fired upon the Hindu-Sikh mobs demonstrating in protest.

Patel's appeal to Viceroy Wavell to act against the rioters fell on deaf ears. Even though Patel was the Home Minister, he lacked jurisdiction to act in Punjab or Bengal, as the law and order was a state subject.

Eventually, Sikhs and Hindus also formed their private armies for self-defence. Mountbatten soon had a taste of Patel's forthrightness when he told him what he had earlier told Wavell, and was deliberately ignored: "If you will not act yourself, then turn over the full authority to the Central Government and let us stop the Muslim League war in Punjab and the NWFP; let us stop the Muslim League army being mobilised in Bengal to attack Assam; let us govern."

# Patel & the Partition of Assets

Geographical partition was not the only partition. There had to be partition and equitable distribution of cash in treasuries, bank balances, records and archives, railways, institutes, printing presses, hospitals, army, government employees, and so on—a formidable task, with potential for massive controversies and disagreements. Formidable tasks requires formidable people. Sardar Patel was the natural choice to head the task for India. Heaviest burdens fell on him. And, tasks that others did not dare to touch, like the integration of the Princely States, were left to him to tackle.

The two main officials were HM Patel for India, and Chaudhary Muhammad Ali for Pakistan. They were overall in-charge, and guided ten expert committees looking into various division of assets and liabilities. What the expert committees could not resolve went to HM Patel and Chaudhary Muhammad Ali; what they, in turn, could not settle went to a Partition Council. The Partition Council comprised Sardar Patel and Rajendra Prasad, with Rajaji as alternate member. Pakistan was represented by MA Jinnah and Liaqat Ali, with Abdur Rab Nishtar as an alternate member.

The Partition Council held a number of meetings till 15 August 1947 to divide the assets. However, the work was so massive it continued till December 1947.

Despite Sardar Patel's other critical engagements, particularly related to integration of the Princely States, and massive work relating to law and order and refugees, he was a regular at each meeting, and kept a hawk's eye on its working and decisions. The reports of the Partition Council, including those of its expert committees, fill thirteen volumes!

HM Patel's words on Sardar Patel and his leadership of the Partition Council: "…farsightedness, generosity and breadth of mind… [Sardar Patel] made himself available for consultation at all hours… It was he who made decisions on behalf of India... With an almost unerring instinct he knew precisely what the right course was, and it can be said that we have gone wrong only where we somehow

succeeded in persuading him against his own instinctive view."{RG/416}

The Pakistan side was much impressed by Patel, his positive attitude, and his decisiveness. At the concluding session of the Partition Council, Abdur Rab Nishtar voiced his admiration for the constructive approach and statesmanship of Patel, and went to the extent of saying that the Pakistani Ministers would continue to look upon him as their elder brother!

# 55 crores to Pakistan: Patel vs. Nehru-Gandhi

India and Pakistan had agreed in November 1947 that Rupees 55 crores remained to be transferred to Pakistan, as its share of the assets of undivided India.

However, at the insistence of Patel, India informed Pakistan, within two hours of the agreement, that the actual implementation of the agreement would hinge on a settlement on Kashmir. Said Patel: "In the division of assets we treated Pakistan generously. But we cannot tolerate even a pie being spent for making bullets to be shot at us. The settlement of assets is like a consent decree. The decree will be executed when all the outstanding points are satisfactorily settled."{RG/461}

Pakistan had been pressing India for rupees 55 crores (over USD 500 million in today's terms). In the Cabinet meeting in January 1948 Patel stated that the money if given would surely be used by Pakistan to arm itself for use in Kashmir, hence the payment should be delayed. Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, NV Gadgil and Dr BR Ambedkar backed Patel. Nehru too expressed his total agreement. The Cabinet therefore decided to withhold the money. Patel told in a Press Conference on 12 January 1948 that the issue of 55 crores could not be dissociated from the other related issues.{RG/462}

Gandhi conveyed to Patel the next day (13 January 1948) that withholding 55 crores from Pakistan was what Mountbatten had opined to him as "a dishonourable act… unstatesman-like and unwise"{RG/462} , and what he [Gandhi] thought was immoral. Patel was furious and asked of Mountbatten: "How can you as a constitutional Governor-General do this behind my back? Do you

know the facts?..."{RG/462}

Gandhi was apparently innocent of the fact that Mountbatten and the British were bent upon favouring Pakistan—even on Kashmir, despite Pakistan's aggression. How could a top leader be so blind to the realities? Unfortunately, Nehru, rather than supporting Patel, and sticking to what he had himself fully agreed to, and had got passed in the Cabinet, went back on his commitment, and commented to Gandhi: "Yes, it was passed but we don't have a case. It is legal quibbling."{RG/463}

Gandhi and Nehru, rather than being prudent about what was in the best interest of the nation, went by what the British colonial representative Mountbatten, having his own axe to grind, had to say, and the Cabinet decision was reversed to let Pakistan have the money, and trouble India further in J&K!

Why didn't Gandhi and Mountbatten consider the immorality of Pakistan in attacking Kashmir which had already acceded to India? If Pakistan had agreed to desist from its illegal action in Kashmir, it would have got the money anyway. And for Nehru, kowtowing to Mountbatten and Gandhi was a priority, rather than standing up for the Cabinet decision, of which he was a part. People like Sardar Patel were out of place in such a scenario.

Gandhi went on a fast to force the issue in his favour (it was one of the several issues that led him to fast). Patel yielded, Gandhi won, and India lost. But, it also resulted in the tragedy of Gandhi's death. Wrote Rajmohan Gandhi: "Wounded by Mountbatten's backbiting and Jawaharlal's disloyalty and bitter at Gandhi's stand on the 55 crores, Patel felt too that the timing of Gandhi's fast 'was hopelessly wrong'."{RG/464}

All those leaders, including Mountbatten and Nehru, who encouraged or prompted Gandhi into that unreasonable position were indirectly guilty of his untimely death. Patel had said something similar to General Roy Bucher: "At our meeting in Dehra Dun, the Sardar [Patel] told me that those who persuaded the Mahatma to suggest that monies (Rs. 55 crore) held in India should be despatched to Pakistan were responsible for the tragedy, and that after the monies were sent off, the Mahatma was moved up to be the

first to be assassinated on the books of a very well-known Hindu revolutionary society. I distinctly remember the Sardar saying: 'You know quite well that for Gandhi to express a wish was almost an order.'" It was on Gandhi's insistence that [his] security had been withdrawn."{BK2/xxi-xxii}
