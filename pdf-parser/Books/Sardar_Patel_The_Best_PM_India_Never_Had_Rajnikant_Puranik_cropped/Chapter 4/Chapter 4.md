# Sardar & Run-up to Freedom, 1944-47

#### Sidelining of Gandhi & Emergence of Patel-Nehru

After the release of Gandhi from prison on 6 May 1944, his role in the freedom movement and transfer of power gradually dwindled.

As long as Gandhi was soft on the British (before 1942), the British gave him due importance, and even helped his projection as a Mahatma. However, after Quit India he almost became like a persona non grata for the British. That lessened his stature and clout in the Congress too. Besides, the British found him to be too complex and unreliable a person to do further business with. The British therefore turned to Sardar Patel and Nehru.

Sardar Patel had internally (although he was not explicit about it) realised that Gandhian methods had ultimately fetched little for India; and if he [Sardar Patel] had to contribute something worthwhile for the country in its critical hours after his release from jail in 1945, he had to ignore Gandhi and Gandhism, and chart out a course on his own. Without doubt, Sardar was far more capable a person, but by being subservient to Gandhi, his vast potential had remained untapped. The British also found Patel to be a frank and forthright person capable of taking decisions, convincing others, and standing by those decisions. They therefore began doing business with Patel, ignoring Gandhi.

In response to Gandhi's announcement in Calcutta on 9 August 1947 that he would spend the rest of his life in Pakistan, Mountbatten reported to London:

"This will infuriate Jinnah, but will be great relief to Congress for, as I have said before, his [Gandhi's] influence is largely negative or even destructive." {Tunz/236}

Gandhi had said in a prayer meeting on 1 April 1947:

"No one listens to me anymore. I am a small man. True, there was a time when mine was a big voice. Then everyone obeyed what I said; now neither the Congress nor the Hindus nor the Muslims listen to me... I am crying in the wilderness."{CWMG/Vol-94}

Gandhi had remarked a few weeks before his death, in a prayer meeting in New Delhi on 25 November 1947:

"…But, today I have become a sort of burden. There was a time when my word was law. But it is no longer so."{CWMG/Vol-97/394}

# Bose, INA Trials & Mutiny

# 18 August 1945: False Claim of Netaji's Death

It was claimed that Netaji Subhas had perished in a plane crash in Taipei. Sarat Chandra Bose, the elder brother of Netaji, had stated in 1947: "Subhash is alive and Jawaharlal knows it." What is surprising is that neither Nehru, nor Patel nor Rajaji nor Gandhi or any other top Congress leader endeavoured to find out the facts on Netaji's death, or made an effort to trace him! Why?

November 1945—May 1946 : INA Red-Fort Trials

Members of the INA (Indian National Army) were tried for "waging war against the King-Emperor". The trials unleashed massive patriotic fervour. Immense public pressure forced the then British Army Chief to commute the sentences. For details, please read 'Bose(s) & INA/ Indian National Army'.

# February 1946 : Mutiny in the Indian Army

INA trials triggered unrest in the Indian armed forces. Mutiny broke out in the Royal Indian Navy (RIN) covering ships and shore establishments throughout India from Karachi to Bombay and from Vishakhapatnam to Calcutta.

Rebellion among the naval ratings in RIN (Royal Indian Navy) started at Bombay on 19 February 1946. Thrilled by the INA fight

and trials, they wanted to contribute their strength towards India's freedom. The insulting behaviour of the senior British military officers had also contributed to the disenchantment of the Indian military staff. The British commanding officer of the HMIS Talwar used to call his Indian men 'black niggers' and 'coolie bastards'. The naval ratings took over HMIS Talwar and signal school, and hauled down the Union Jack. The NCSC (Naval Central Strike Committee) was set up, and several ships which were seized began flying the flags of the Congress and the Muslim League. The mutiny quickly spread to other ships, and over 7000 sailors joined in. Some of the warships seized threatened to fire at the British barracks, and at British community bastions on the seafront. On 21 February 1946 there was an exchange of fire between the loyal troops and the naval ratings on mutiny. At some places, Indian army men began ignoring orders from the British superiors. In Madras and Pune, the British garrisons had to face revolts.

In the second half of February 1946 members of the Royal Indian Air Force (RIAF) went on a hunger strike for their grievances. RAIF personnel at Allahabad, Delhi, Karachi, Madras, and Pune also revolted. Another Army mutiny took place at Jabalpur during the last week of February 1946. It lasted about two weeks. It was suppressed by force. Later, many were court-martialled and sentenced. A number of them were dismissed.

Many workers, students and members of the general public took to the streets in protest. The mutineers began to receive significant militant support from the general public. By 19 February 1946 over 3,00,000 mill-workers and dockers of the naval dockyard went on strike. Planning to take their agitation forward by teaming up with the Indian political parties, they approached the Congress leader Aruna Asaf Ali who happened to be then in Bombay. Aruna Asaf Ali, however, was not of much help, and directed them to Sardar Patel.

However, with no support forthcoming from the political parties, and totally cornered, the naval ratings were left with no options. As a last resort, they approached Sardar Patel, who telling them there ought to be discipline in the navy, advised them to surrender! In tears, the NCSC President MS Khan conveyed Sardar Patel's message to his colleagues on 22 February 1946. By then the mutiny

was in its fourth day. Sardar Patel had, however, assured them that if they surrender, the Congress would do all it could to ensure there was no victimisation, and that their legitimate demands were met. Muslims among the naval ratings then desired to know what Jinnah had to say. It later turned out that Jinnah's advice was no different from that of Patel. The mutiny terminated on 23 February 1946. Over 230 lost their lives and over a thousand were injured in the mutiny and the associated rioting in Bombay.

The British Commander-in-Chief Field Marshall Claude Auchinleck recorded: "*It is no use shutting one's eye to the fact that any Indian worth his salt is a nationalist… Wholesale defections and disintegration of the Indian Army was possible* ."

Perhaps Bose, INA, and the above mutinies contributed far more to gaining independence for India than the Gandhian movement of over three decades.

### Elections 1945-46

Elections to the Central and the Provincial Assemblies were scheduled at the end of 1945, and were to extend into 1946. The franchise for the elections was still limited to about 10% of the population for the Provinces, and less than 1% for the Centre. Sardar Patel was not in favour of elections at that juncture for several reasons: many Congress leaders and cadres were still in jails; Patel and others were released from jails only in June 1945, and have had little time to prepare for elections; electoral rolls were not revised, leaving many young out of the fold. Yet, Maulana Azad, as the Congress President then, agreed for elections. Why? Did he secretly desire an advantage for the Muslims, and the Muslim League? One doesn't know. In any case, why didn't he heed the wise counsel of Patel?

The Congress did manage to get considerable Muslim votes a decade earlier in the 1936 elections. However, in the 1945-46 elections, it was almost a clean sweep by the Muslim League in Muslim areas. The Muslim League decidedly commanded the Muslim vote, except in NWFP, thanks to the Seemant Gandhi Khan

Abdul Ghaffar Khan. The Muslim League got all the 30 Muslim seats (100%) in the Central Assembly, and 427 of the 507 Muslim seats (84%) in the 11 provinces.

Many factors led to such favourable results for the Jinnah's Muslim League: resignation of the Congress ministries in 1939, leaving the field open for the British and their collaborators, the Muslim League; "Quit India" call of 1942 that amounted to the Congress quitting the political scene for the next 3 years; growing Raj–League bonhomie at the expense of Raj–Congress relationship; Islam-in-danger cry; hope for creation of Pakistan; perception in the Muslim mind of Jinnah as a powerful leader, what with Gandhi repeatedly knocking at his doors, and Viceroy Wavell [deliberately, and as per a well laid-out British plan] capitulating to his conditions in the Shimla Conference.

The results further boosted Jinnah's stature, and he became even more aggressive, uncompromising, intransigent and intractable in his unreasonable demands.

#### Election Results

The Congress won 56 seats in the Central Assembly and 930 in the provinces, thanks to the non-Muslim vote which was firmly with it.

In Sind, out of a total of 60, the Congress had won 22, and the Muslim League 27 seats. In Punjab, out of a total of 175, Muslim League won 75, Unionists 21, Congress 51, Sikhs 21, and independents 7. In Bengal, out of a total of 250, Muslim League won 115, Other Muslims 3, Congress 62, Other Hindu Parties and Scheduled Castes 31, Krishak Praja Party 5, Communists 3, Christians and Anglo-Indians 6, and Europeans 25.

The overall position could have been much better had Azad, as President of the Congress, not acted dictatorial, and heeded Patel's advice.

#### Azad's Blunders in Sind, Punjab and Bengal

In Sind, Patel had brought several non-Muslim League Muslims to his side, notably the Chief Minister Ghulam Hussain Hidayatullah, Maula Bux, and his brother Allah Bux; and was confident of

managing a majority of 35 seats out of 60. Wrote Stanley Wolpert in his book 'Jinnah of Pakistan': "It was a most bitter pill for Jinnah to swallow. He had laboured long and hard for an independent province of Sind. Now the Sardar, the Congress's strong man, the shrew organisational hand…had snatched the plum from Jinnah's lips just as he was about to savour its sweetness."{Wolp/164}

Azad, however, was involved in his own pointless exercise in Sind of aligning with the Muslim League to form a ministry, against the advice of Patel, and without the approval of the CWC. He undid the work of Patel; and ultimately it was the Muslim League which formed the ministry in a coalition that excluded the Congress.

Similarly, Azad messed up both Punjab and Bengal. As the Congress President, and as a Muslim, he had ruled that it would be he who would deal with, and take final decisions on, the Muslimmajority provinces. Azad was devoted to protecting and furthering Muslim interests. He was in the Congress because he felt he could advance Muslim interests better by being in the Congress, rather than by being in the Muslim League. In his arrogance, he ignored Patel. Azad lacked the organisational ability, wisdom and tact of Patel, and the Congress suffered at the critical juncture. The magic that Patel could weave in 1937-elections, he could not do in 1945- 46, thanks to Azad trying to be one up. Azad's secret machinations vis-à-vis the *Cabinet Mission Plan* that favoured the Muslimdominated *Groupings* so disturbed Gandhi that he was compelled to ask for his resignation from the post of the Congress President.

# Cabinet Mission, March 1946

Massive public support in favour of the INA soldiers in the INA trials, and a consequent surge in patriotic fervour and unrest in the army and navy leading to mutiny, convinced the British they could no longer rely on the Indian army to continue to rule India, and must pack up.

On 17 February 1946 Lord Pethick-Lawrence announced in the British Parliament that a Cabinet Mission would be sent to India to discuss Indian freedom. Prime Minister Clement Attlee told the

House of Commons on 15 March 1946: "If India elects for independence she has a right to do so." The Raj had, at last, decided to pack up.

A British Cabinet Mission comprising three cabinet ministers— Lord Pethick-Lawrence, the Secretary of State for India, Sir Stafford Cripps, President of the Board of Trade, and AV Alexander, the First Lord of the Admiralty—arrived in India on 23 March 1946 at the initiative of Clement Attlee, the Prime Minister of the UK, to discuss and plan for the Indian independence, and the transfer of power to Indian leadership. Their discussions with the INC (Indian National Congress) and the IML (all-India Muslim League) did not yield a common ground acceptable to both.

# 16-May-1946 Cabinet Mission Plan

So as to make headway, the Cabinet Mission unilaterally proposed a plan (what has come to be known as the "16 May Cabinet Mission Plan"), that was announced by PM Attlee in the House of Commons on 16 May 1946.

The State Paper comprising the Cabinet Mission proposals first stated why the conflicting demands of the INC and the IML were not accepted. The Cabinet Mission Paper stated that even though they appreciated the anxiety of the League to protect themselves from the perpetual majority Hindu rule, the IML's demand for a separate nation was rejected on the following grounds:

(a)Pakistan was no solution for the Minority, as, on one hand, it would leave sizable number of Muslims in "Hindu" India, while, on the other hand, it would leave sizable number of non-Muslims in Pakistan.

(b)There was no justification in including the predominant non-Muslim districts of Punjab, Bengal and Assam in Pakistan.

(c)Creation of Muslim-majority Pakistan would necessitate partition of Punjab and Bengal: something which is contrary to the wishes and detrimental to the interests of the inhabitants of those provinces.

(d)Division of Punjab would mean division of the Sikh community, which would be most unjust and unfair to them.

(e)As West Pakistan would be separated from the East Pakistan by hundreds of miles, their joint administration and defence would be very challenging.

The main provisions of the "May 16 Cabinet Mission Plan" were as under:

(1)Independence to be granted to a UNITED dominion of India, which would be a loose confederation of provinces. IML's demand for Pakistan was turned down.

(2)Central Government at Delhi would handle nationwide affairs like defence, currency and finance, communications and foreign affairs, while the rest of the powers and responsibility would belong to the provinces.

(3)British paramountcy over the Princely States would lapse upon transfer of power; it would NOT be transferred to the new Government, making them (Princely States) independent. It was hoped the Princely States would negotiate their way in the Union Government.

(4)To frame the constitution, a Constituent Assembly would be formed comprising 293 representatives of the Provincial Assemblies (in proportion to population) and 93 members of the Princely States.

(5)Provincial Legislatures would be grouped as detailed below.

Groupings & the Catch therein

As per the "16 May Cabinet Mission Plan" Provincial Legislatures were to be grouped as under:

(A)*Group-A* : Madras, UP, Central provinces, Bombay, Bihar and Orissa.

(B)*Group-B* : Punjab, Sindh, NWFP, Baluchistan.

(C)*Group-C* : Assam and Bengal. Assam then included the whole of Northeast.

Whether the groupings were compulsory or voluntary was left vague. Did Assam, for example, had a right to opt out of Group-C? This was left vague.

The grouping, as above, effectively gave weightage to the idea of Pakistan, even though the Cabinet Mission rejected the demand for

a separate nation of Pakistan. Group-B comprised Muslim-majority provinces. 22 of the 35 seats were allocated to Muslims in Group-B. Hindu-majority Assam too came under Muslim-majority Group-C by being clubbed with Bengal. 36 of the 70 seats in Group-C were allocated to Muslims. As such, two of the three groups became Muslim-majority groups.

Compared to what happened upon Partition in 1947 Group-B represented greater West Pakistan, by including whole of Punjab; and Group-C represented greater East Pakistan, by including whole of Bengal plus Assam, and Assam then included the whole of North-Eastern States. Group-B and Group-C being Muslim-majority groups were effectively Pakistan.

#### 16-June-1946 Cabinet Mission Plan : Interim Govt.

On 16 June 1946 the Cabinet Mission outlined the procedure for the formation of the Interim Government: a council of 14 members comprising 6 Congress Hindus (Nehru, Sardar Patel, Rajendra Prasad, Rajaji, Dr HK Mahtab and Jagjivan Ram), 5 League Muslims (MA Jinnah, Liaquat Ali Khan, Nawab Mohammad Ismail Khan, Khwaja Sir Nazimuddin, Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar), Baldev Singh as a Sikh, NP Engineer as a Parsi and Dr John Matthai as a Christian.

#### Jinnah's Stand

Jinnah was initially reluctant to accept the "16 May Cabinet Mission Plan" as it did not provide for a separate nation of Pakistan which his Muslim League had been campaigning for. However, after deliberations with the British politicians and officials he realised that the provisions for the Muslims in the "16 May Cabinet Mission Plan" were the best Britain could offer and the Muslim League could secure, and it would be foolish to reject it. There were, of course, many Muslims who wondered why they were led astray with the false promise of a separate nation if the "16 May Cabinet Mission Plan" was acceptable to the Muslim League. However, after various clarifications and assurances, Muslim League accepted the "16 May Cabinet Mission Plan" on 6 June 1946; and subsequently it accepted "16 June Plan" too for the Interim Government. However, the resolution adopted by the Muslim League on 6 June 1946 reiterated

that its unalterable final objective was to ensure a sovereign State of Pakistan.

# Congress Stand

Maulana Azad, the then President of the Congress, finding the proposed Groupings overall favoured the Muslims, wrote secretly to Viceroy Wavell, and to the Cabinet Mission, without consulting the CWC, on the possibility of bringing the Congress around on Groupings. He was also willing to have no Muslim representative from the Congress side in the government, as Jinnah had been demanding. Such acts of Azad were like stabs in the back. Gandhi was so hugely disturbed that he compelled Azad to resign.{BK/242}

The Congress and Gandhi were not comfortable with either of the two plans of the Cabinet Mission, particularly after the nature of clarifications given by the Cabinet Mission and Viceroy Wavell on the groupings. They didn't accept either plan. Given this situation, Jinnah was on the seventh heaven, looking forward to be invited to form the interim government.

# Patel's Critical Initiative

However, Patel was determined to thwart the Muslim League and Jinnah. He was determined he won't let Jinnah walk away with the trophy. Given Gandhi's hang-ups and muddle-headedness, and the confusion and uncertainty prevailing among the other members of the CWC, including Nehru, Rajaji, Kriplani, Azad, and others, Patel risked his all and took a private, personal initiative to negotiate the matter with the British.

Sir BN Rau, a Raj official, called privately on Patel around 20 June 1946. Patel realised that 'May 16 Plan' had to be accepted, even with its flaws, if 'June 16 Plan' was to be rejected, for it was the only route to power, and the only way to scuttle Jinnah. Once in power, the flaws could be addressed. During the critical period between 22 and 24 June there were several private discussions between Patel and members of the Cabinet Mission and Raj officials. Sudhir Ghosh, a go-between for the Raj had stated: "I told Cripps and Pethick-Lawrence that the only advice I could give them about salvaging something out of the wreckage was that they should have

a private talk with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who was the only man amongst the Congress leaders who was a practical statesman."

The ultimate result of Patel's individual exertions was that the Congress accepted the 'May 16 Plan', while rejecting the 'June 16 Plan', even though Gandhi was not agreeable, and had this to say to the CWC: "I admit defeat. I cannot advise you to accept the May 16 proposition... But you should follow my intuition only if it appeals to your reason."

When Jinnah came to know that the Congress had accepted the 'May 16 Plan', while rejecting the 'June 16 Plan', he impressed upon Viceroy Wavell that as the League had accepted both the plans, in all fairness, the League should be invited to form the Interim Government. Jinnah was certain that he would be called upon. But, thanks to Patel's play of the dice, that didn't happen.

Jinnah was furious at the proverbial slip between the cup and the lips. He termed what happened as a deceit of the Congress, and a betrayal of trust by the Cabinet Mission and the Viceroy, and alleged a secret deal between Vallabhbhai Patel and the Cabinet Mission. {VT/37}

Rajaji, in a letter to Patel, later conceded that the CWC's decision of 25 June 1946 to accepted the 'May 16 Plan', while rejecting the 'June 16 Plan' was "all due to your [Patel's] firm and thoughtful stand."

Patel was clear in his goal: bringing the Congress to power, and scuttling the Muslim League's strategy of getting inflated share in power. Thanks to Patel's initiative and his firm lead, the CWC rejected Gandhi's advice. In the national interest, Patel had to defy Gandhi, and he did, and succeeded in thwarting the formation of Jinnah's government.

Viceroy Wavell could not help feeling he had been outmanoeuvred by Patel, and in a letter to King George VI wrote: "Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is the recognized 'tough' of the Congress Working Committee and by far the most forcible character amongst them. He is probably the only one of them capable of standing up to Gandhi."{VT/37}

During the earlier discussions stage, Wavell had remarked:

"Patel's face of cold angry disapproval was a study… in khadi, but wearing it more like a Roman toga, and with rather a Roman face, powerful, clever, uncompromising, very seldom speaking, but listening with obvious disapproval."{Wav/259/L-6278}

The Cabinet Mission left India on 29 June 1946, but before leaving told the Congress and the League that the 'June 16 Plan' was dead; and that in view of both having accepted the May 16 Plan, a new way forward would be attempted shortly.

However, Patel manoeuvred to ensure the Congress was invited to form an interim government, so that the situation descending into a chaos could be controlled, and the Muslim League shown its place. When Jinnah realised he would be left out in the cold, he hurried to ensure the Muslim League too joined the Interim Government.

# July 1946: Nehru's Monumental Blunder

Thanks to Gandhi, Nehru had become the President of the Congress at the end of April 1946, and hence the would be first PM. Nehru did a blunder at the very start of his Presidency. After the AICC ratification of the CWC's acceptance of the 'May 16 Cabinet Mission Plan' on 25 June 1946, Nehru remarked at the AICC on 7 July 1946: "…*We are not bound by a single thing except that we have decided to go into the Constituent Assembly... When India is free, India will do just what she likes* …"{Mak/83}

At a press conference in Mumbai 3 days later on 10 July 1946, he declared that the Congress would be "*completely unfettered by agreements and free to meet all situations as they arise* " {Azad/164} , and that "*the central government was likely to be much stronger than what the Cabinet Mission envisaged* ."

*Nehru also emphasised that the Congress regarded itself free to change or modify the cabinet Mission Plan as it thought best* . {Azad/165} How could Nehru talk of unilaterally changing what was mutually agreed upon by the Congress, the Muslim League, and the British? What then was the sanctity of the agreement?

Nehru then made controversial remarks on the grouping proposed in the May 16 Plan. As it was, Jinnah was under severe pressure from his colleagues and supporters for having accepted the

'May 16 Plan', and thus giving up on an independent Islamic State of Pakistan. Nehru's statement gave Jinnah an excuse to repudiate his earlier acceptance of the Plan, and demand a separate state of Pakistan.

Nehru's indiscretion (remarks quoted above) put paid to the scheme of united India, precipitated Jinnah's call for Pakistan, and resulted in the AIML's ghastly Direct Action Day call for 16 August 1946 that led to the *Calcutta Carnage* , the *Great Calcutta Killings* the worst communal riot instigated by the Muslim League, that left 5,000 to 10,000 dead, 15,000 injured, and about one lakh homeless! Maulana Azad called Nehru's act "*one of those unfortunate events which change the course of history* ."{Azad/164}

The Congress tried its best to back-track on Nehru's statement, and issued statements reassuring its commitment on 'May 16 Plan'. But, the deed was done. Jinnah had got the excuse and the opportunity he wanted. Perhaps Jinnah also believed that Nehru's statement exposed the real mind and intention of the Congress.

# Interim Government, Sep-1946

Nehru, who had since [most undemocratically] become the Congress President [thanks to Gandhi's grossly unethical partiality], was invited by Viceroy Wavell on 12 August 1946 to form an Interim Government. It was formed on 2 September 1946. It comprised 7 Congressmen (Nehru, Sardar Patel, Rajaji, Rajendra Prasad, Sarat Chandra Bose, Jagjivan Ram and Asaf Ali), 2 non-Congress Muslims (Shafaat Ahmad Khan and Ali Zaheer), and 3 from other minorities (Baldev Singh, John Mathai and CH Bhabha). Nehru kept the External Affairs ministry, while Sardar headed Home and Information & Broadcasting.

#### 15-Oct-1946: AIML joins Interim Govt to Wreck it from Within

Rather than acting against the Muslim League for their repudiation of the Cabinet Mission Plan, followed by their Direct Action Day of 16 August 1946, and inciting the ghastly Calcutta Communal Carnage, Viceroy Wavell invited the Muslim League to

join the Interim Government at the Centre. The Muslim League, keen to get into power, joined the Interim Government on 15 October 1946.

Upon League's entry Sarat Chandra Bose, Shafaat Ahmad Khan and Ali Zaheer left the ministry; and five Muslim League members became ministers, which included Liaqat Ali as Finance Minister, and Jogendra Nath Mandal, a Scheduled Caste Hindu from Bengal (perhaps in revenge of the Congress retaining a Muslim, Asaf Ali).

With the joining of the League, trouble started, and the government's functioning was badly hampered. Indeed, the very purpose of Jinnah for the Muslim League to join the government was to "*wreck it from within* "! The aim of the Muslim League, encouraged and aided by the British, was to achieve Pakistan by sabotage inside the government, and by Direct Action (riots), disorder, and chaos outside.

A League nominee in the government, Ghaznafar Ali Khan frankly admitted:

*"We are going into the Interim Government to get a foothold to fight for our cherished goal of Pakistan… The Interim Government is one of the fronts of Direct Action campaign." {Jal/227}*

Sardar Patel had prophetically remarked to Wavell as early as on 12 June 1946: "Jinnah would only use his position in the Interim Government for purely communal and disruptive purposes and to break up India". {BK2/84}

Ministries and departments controlled by the League became like Muslim jagirs, so much so that it was as if every Muslim officer had become a guard of the League. Refused Home Portfolio by Patel, the League snatched Finance, a critical portfolio, and made Liaqat Ali its head. Nehru did the blunder of giving the Finance portfolio to Liaqat Ali. Liaqat made full misuse of his portfolio to choke finance to the Congress ministries, and tighten the screws on the industrialists financing the Congress—by throwing Nehruvian socialism in Nehru's face. The Congress Ministers found to their dismay that they could not even appoint a peon without an approval from the Finance Ministry headed by Liaqat Ali. Ministries and departments controlled

by the League became like Muslim jagirs, so much so that it was as if every Muslim officer had become a guard of the League. The aim of the Muslim League, encouraged and aided by the British, was to achieve Pakistan by sabotaging the government from inside, and by *Direct Action* (riots), disorder, and chaos outside. They succeeded. Nehru, Patel, and other Congress Ministers realised it was not possible to run a government with the Muslim League, and the sooner they got rid of them the better. Perhaps the only way to do so was Partition and Pakistan, which is what the Muslim League and the British had conspired for.

# Patel's New Home & Colleagues, Oct-1946

In October 1946 Patel shifted from Birla House to a bungalow at 1, Aurangzeb Road (now, thankfully, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road) allotted to him as a minister in the government.

# V Shankar & HM Patel

Vijay Shankar (V Shankar), a young ICS officer, had since joined Sardar as private secretary. His "*Reminiscences of Sardar Patel, Volume 1 and 2* " {Shan} are worth reading. Sadly, the books related to Sardar Patel (including VP Menon's books) are either out-of-print or are absent from circulation.

Another key person who joined Patel was HM Patel (1904–1993), ICS, as Cabinet Secretary in the Home Ministry during 1946–50. He also played a major role in division of assets between India and Pakistan upon partition. He later joined the Swatantra Party of Rajaji. From 1977 to 1980, he served as the Finance Minister and later as the Home Minister of India. Wrote MO Mathai of him: "H.M. Patel had established a reputation as a competent civil servant… Like an elephant, he needed only three hours of sleep at night. He used his ample spare time in reading."{Mac2/L-3792}

# VP Menon

Of course, the most significant person who joined Patel was VP

Menon.

Upon being asked by Viceroy Lord Wavell who his successor should be, the then British Reforms Commissioner had recommended: "Without a doubt, V P Menon. There is no British officer in India now who is his equal. Nor for that matter, any Indian."{MKN}

When Viceroy Wavell asked VP Menon his views on the Cabinet Mission Plan of 1946, he commented presciently: "Truth is always bitter. None of the recommendations of the Mission will be agreed to by Indian political leaders. A quarrelsome India is the secret purpose of the recommendations."{MKN}

Vappala Pangunni (VP) Menon (1893–1965) was the Constitutional Adviser and Political Reforms Commissioner to the last three Viceroys during the British rule in India. He had an in-depth understanding of the British and Indian politics.

Son of a school headmaster, Menon, a Keralite born in Malabar, had modest beginning working as a railway stoker, miner, an English teacher, a clerk, before joining the Indian Civil Service in a junior post in 1914. By dint of his honesty, sincerity, competence, brilliance and hard work, he rose through the ranks to become the highest serving Indian officer in British India. He had also attended the Indian Round Table Conferences in London.

Senior British staff of Mountbatten had advised him that although VP Menon was a fine gentleman and a very competent professional; being a Hindu, and being close to the Congress, he ought not to be taken into confidence as before. However, Menon's stellar role in Shimla in May 1947 that retrieved Mountbatten from his embarrassing situation so impressed Mountbatten that Menon became one of his most trusted advisors thereafter.

VP Menon had frankly predicted to Mountbatten that neither the Congress nor the AIML would accept his May-1947. When that happened Mountbatten told VP Menon: "VP, you were right. I should have consulted you earlier. Now help me with a new draft." Sitting there that night, VP Menon dictated to Mountbatten's PA what became the British Parliament Resolution granting Dominion Status to India and Pakistan in 1947!{MKN} It was VP Menon's scheme for

partition and creation of the two dominions of India and Pakistan that was ultimately adopted, after modifications.

After independence, Menon was appointed secretary of the Ministry of the States headed by Sardar Patel. Menon impressed Patel with his political genius and work ethic, and became his trusted colleague, and a right-hand man. Menon played a major role both in negotiating the "*Transfer of Power* " from the British, and in the "*Integration of the Princely States* ". It was VP Menon who had drafted the "Instrument of Accession" and insisted upon the necessity of accession of the Princely States into India before the date of independence of 15 August 1947, and tactfully implemented it along with Sardar Patel.

VP Menon had flown to Srinagar along with Sam Manekshaw and MC Mahajan (J&K Premier) on 25 October 1947{VPM1/273} to assess the situation in Kashmir; returned on 26 October 1947, and recommended immediate air-lifting of Indian troops to Srinagar to save Kashmir from Pakistan-backed raiders; and then flew to Jammu the same day and got the "Instrument of Accession" signed by Maharaja Hari Singh in India's favour. {VPM1/274-5}

VP Menon's two books "*The Transfer of Power in India* "{VPM2} and "*The Story of Integration of the Indian States* " {VPM1} are must-read references on the subjects from the horse's mouth.

Unlike the dominant crowd of unenlightened, zero-in-the-basicsof-economics, socialist-communist imitators who joined the Congress, Socialist Parties, or the Communist Party, Menon joined the Swatantra Party of Rajaji that believed in the free market economy.

For his unmatched contribution for the integration of the Indian Princely States that enhanced India's geographical area by a whopping 40%, and for his critical positive role in the transfer of power from the British to India, *VP Menon certainly deserved a Bharat Ratna* . But, when Nehru and Indira (Rajiv too) refused to recognise even Sardar Patel for *Bharat Ratna* , and shamelessly pinned the award on themselves when they were the ones deciding upon the same as prime ministers, where was the question of recognising Sardar Patel's deputy?

Wrote MKK Nair: "*V P Menon's name ought to be written in letters of gold in Indian history. But he did not get the credit due for what he had achieved. Those who sinned most against him were Nehru and a few other politicians* ."{MKN}

Indeed, despite his proven capabilities, Nehru made no use of VP Menon's unmatched talents after the death of Sardar Patel—so partisan was Nehru: anything or anyone related to Patel invited Nehru's contempt, deserving to be ignored or obliterated or erased from the public memory.

Wrote MKK Nair:

"After Patel's death, Nehru decided to ignore VP Menon totally. Thus, VP Menon who was amongst the most brilliant administrators in Indian history was eased out. A little before VP left the Government, Nehru had appointed him as a stopgap Governor of Orissa when Asif Ali went on a short sabbatical. Even political tenderfoots knew that Nehru did not like to hear V P Menon and his contributions being praised. So they wilfully ignored and obliterated him and his unforgettable contributions to the unity, strength and security of India."{MKN}
