## Nehru vs. Sardar

*"The second [the first being Netaji Bose] Chanakyan figure contributing to the evolution of India's foreign policy was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel...[his] bringing about the accession of the Princely States to the new dominion of India was primarily an exercise in foreign relations..."*

—JN Dixit, 'Makers of India's Foreign Policy'{Dix/61}

Nehru: Foreign to Foreign Policy?

Nehru used to show himself off as an "internationalist", and an expert in international affairs. Not only that, he used to be condescending towards those not up to the mark in world affairs, in his opinion, and was downright contemptuous towards them. His hubris knew no bounds. On Sardar Patel he had commented: "… Also it is difficult for him [Sardar Patel] to think internationally. In this he represents our people far more than I do."{RG2/L-5725} What airs! As if he [Nehru] himself had great knowledge, depth and clarity of thinking on international affairs and India's foreign policy!

Proof of pudding is in the eating. Empty verbiage can't substitute for actual results. Nehru's foreign policy was a monumental failure. While being the prime minister, Nehru also held the portfolio of foreign affairs, regarding himself as a great, irreplaceable expert in the area. One wishes he had chosen a competent person for the job, for in practically all areas of foreign policies India grievously suffered.

Nehru's policy and strategy in J&K—part of the Foreign Policy, in a way, particularly after its reference to the UN—actually gave birth to the Kashmir Problem. He failed to solve the problem he had

himself created, and actually made it more complicated.

Even after doing the initial few blunders on Kashmir, Nehru could have retrieved the situation had he heeded the sane advice of Sardar Patel and others, but he was too arrogant, and too sold out to Mountbatten to do any course correction. Instead, he kept making the bad situation worse and worse by committing more and more blunders.

But for Sardar Patel, and left to Nehru, both Hyderabad and Junagadh would have been another Pakistan or Kashmir.

Nehru allowed Tibet, our peaceful neighbour and a buffer between us and China, to be erased as a nation, without even recording a protest in the UN, thereby making our northern borders insecure, and putting a question mark on the future of the water resources that originate in Tibet. Nehru focussed on the Korean conflict happening far away from India, while soft-peddling the Tibet invasion next door, even though Tibet was so critical to our national security interests. Wasn't it ironic that Nehru internationalised a matter he should not have, while he refused to internationalise a matter that he should have. He referred J&K, an internal, domestic matter, to the UN, which he should not have internationalised; while he refused to refer Tibet, a serious, external security matter, to the UN, which he should have.

Despite what China did to Tibet, India signed 'The Panchsheel Agreement' with China on 29 April 1954. The agreement itself was titled "Agreement on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India" thus acknowledging Tibet as a part of China. India gained nothing through the Agreement, and all benefits accrued to China. Nehru did not even insist on prior settlement of borders, ignoring the sane advice of Girija Shankar Bajpai of the External Affairs Ministry. Panchsheel is actually a most eloquent example of the naivety of the Indian diplomacy and a shining example of what an international agreement should not be! Acharya Kriplani had rightly commented: "This great doctrine was born in sin, because it was enunciated to put the seal of our approval upon the destruction of an ancient nation which was associated with us spiritually and culturally... It was a nation which wanted to live its own

life and it sought to have been allowed to live its own life..."

Both the US and the USSR were willing to accommodate India as a Permanent Member of the UNSC (United Nations Security Council) in 1955, in lieu of Taiwan, or as a sixth member, after amending the UN charter. This Nehru refused! Nehru wanted the seat to be given to PRC (Peoples Republic of China), as Nehru did not want China to be marginalised! It was almost as if Nehru, for reasons one cannot fathom, totally ignored India's own strategic interests!

Nehru failed to negotiate with China on a peaceful settlement of borders, so vital to India's security. Doing so was not difficult considering that China at that time was not strong, had numerous external and internal problems to contend with, and was therefore willing for a "give and take", particularly Aksai Chin—McMahon Line swap: recognition of McMahon Line by China in return for India's recognition of China's claim on Aksai Chin, with minor adjustments. For over a decade (the whole of fifties and the early sixties), umpteen occasions presented themselves, both during the numerous visits of Zhou En Lai to India and the visit of Nehru to China, to settle the issue, but Nehru frittered away all the opportunities. Nehru let go even the Panchsheel moment to close the issue.

The then US president John F Kennedy was an admirer of Indian democracy, and when he learnt that China was on its way to detonate a nuclear device, he wanted that it ought to be a democratic country like India, and not communist China, which should have nuclear capability. The Kennedy administration was ready to help India out with nuclear deterrence. But, Nehru rejected the offer. Currently, India has been canvassing support from various countries to become a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in vain, so far. Had Nehru gone along with Kennedy's advice, India would have detonated a nuclear device well before China. Had that happened, not only would India have been a member of the NSG long, long ago, but China would not have dared to attack India, nor would Pakistan have taken liberties to attack India in 1965.

Nehru's policies resulted in thousands of kilometres of all land

boundaries of India, whether in the north or east or west or northeast or northwest, becoming sensitive and insecure, requiring massive investments to protect them. Thanks to Gandhi and his choice for the first PM of India, perhaps India is the only country of its size in the world with such a long unsettled border with a giant neighbour, and disputes with another. Rather than solving a plethora of severe problems crying for attention, the Nehruvian era added new problems, and not just added them, made them more difficult and almost insolvable, the most severe being securing the long borders.

Rather than having strong allies on its side to deter others, India, thanks to Nehru's self-defeating foreign policies, remained nonaligned so that Pakistan (aligned with the West) and China (aligned with the USSR) felt free to attack India, knowing it to be a non-risky business as no country would come to the rescue of a non-aligned India in its hours of distress. Common sense dictated that till you became strong enough to defend yourself, have sensible pacts with some strong nations to take care of your security. Non-aligned policy fetched no gains for India. If India had aligned itself with the US and the West, not only would India have been much better off economically, China would not have dared to attack India, nor would Pakistan have either attacked Kashmir or played mischief in J&K. Further, the UK and the USA would not have favoured Pakistan over India on Kashmir, and the Kashmir issue would have been solved in India's favour long ago.

Writes Fareed Zakaria in 'The Post-American World':

"Nehru rooted India's foreign policy in abstract ideas rather than a strategic conception of national interests. He disdained alliances, pacts, and treaties, seeing them as part of the old rules of realpolitik, and was uninterested in military matters... Nehru tended to put hope above calculation. When he was warned that Communist China would probably seek to annex Tibet, for example, he doubted it, arguing that it would be foolish and impractical adventure. And even after Beijing did annex Tibet in 1951, Nehru would not reassess the nature of Chinese interests along India's northern border…"{Zak/148}

Walter Crocker writes in 'Nehru: A Contemporary's Estimate': "He [Nehru] insisted on keeping the portfolio of external affairs for

himself. It was a disadvantage to him that he did so, because, as head of the whole government of India, he had to deal with a range of internal problems already too much for one mind. And it was a disadvantage to the Indian foreign office and the Indian diplomatic service. In effect he did damage to both, and at a formative and impressionable stage of their growth..."{Croc/56}

If ours was a good foreign policy, how come all our major neighbours became our enemies? And, a friendly neighbour, Tibet, disappeared as an independent nation? How come all our borders turned insecure during the Nehruvian era, costing us a fortune to defend them? How come no nation came to India's rescue (including Nehru's non-aligned friends) in its war with China, except the nation Nehru and Krishna Menon always panned—the United States; or the nation Nehru refused to recognise—Israel? You evaluate a policy by its results, not by its verbosity and pompousness.

*Nehru himself had this to admit: "We were getting out of touch with reality in the modern world and we were living in an artificial atmosphere of our creation."*

### Sardar Patel & Foreign Policy

Sardar Patel, who Nehru had snobbishly derided as someone who was incapable of thinking "internationally", had a real grasp on the subject as obvious both from his actions and his pronouncements.

Sardar Patel's letter dated 7 November 1950, about five weeks before his death, to Nehru on Tibet and China, which has since become famous for being prophetic and is often quoted, is reproduced in full in the earlier chapter.

Writes Rajmohan Gandhi in "Patel: A Life": "As for the ability to include international factors in national strategies, Vallabhbhai, as time would show, probably possessed it in a greater measure than Nehru." {RG2/L-5741}

Adds Rajmohan Gandhi in the same book: "*But it [Sardar's mind]*

*was sharp as a razor and seasoned by a lifetime's interest in people. Weighing the men in Ahmednagar, Pattabhi [Sitaramiah] called Patel 'the most wise'* .'' {RG2/L-5748}

Basically, while Nehru followed the Marxist line in the economic, social, historical, religious, cultural and academic affairs, that perpetuated poverty and misery, made India forever a developing, third-rate, third-world country, and an international beggar, and distorted and belittled India's heritage; Sardar Patel favoured a sensible capitalist, free-market economy, and Gandhian values. Further, while Nehru followed a pacifist, self-defeating, spineless Gandhian policy in foreign affairs and external security, including that on the integration of the Princely States, particularly Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh; Sardar Patel favoured an aggressive, non-Gandhian, Curzonian (like that of Lord Curzon) policy.

Integration of the Princely States into India before and after independence was an act that required a policy akin to a national foreign policy. In this too, Nehru failed, as we know from the failure of his Kashmir policy.

Writes JN Dixit in his book 'Makers of India's Foreign Policy':

"The second [the first being SC Bose] Chanakyan figure contributing to the evolution of India's foreign policy was Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel...[his] bringing about the accession of the Princely States to the new dominion of India was primarily an exercise in foreign relations... To compound these uncertainties, Jawaharlal Nehru and some other like-minded Congress leaders wanted to let the people's movement in each of these [there were 562!] Princely States decide the political status of their respective territories. Sardar Patel realized that the princes, as well as the people's movements in these Princely States, would be subject to the crosscurrents of princely pleasures, feudal loyalties and blandishments from interested British officials and Pakistani leaders. He, therefore, embarked on a systematic and vigorous campaign to persuade the princes and the peoples of their states to join India... Patel showed a capacity to exercise decisive political will to negotiate in accordance with India's interests and to resort to the calibrated use of coercive

force to meet India's interests... Even more significant, however, were Patel's profoundly prescient views and assessments on India's relations with Pakistan and China..."{Dix/61}

Unfortunately, Sardar did not live long. Had he survived another decade, India would have been internally and externally secure, and would not have had Kashmir, Pakistan or China problem; and consequently the problem of terrorism it has been grappling with.

#### Patel, Goa & Nehru

Nehru adopted for Goa his usual dilly-dallying, indecisive, faulty approach, driven by, or under the excuse or cover of the non-violent Gandhian principles, which had in practice been ineffective.

Nehru always showed unwarranted concern for the international opinion. He assumed the world would view India negatively if India used force to evict the Portuguese from Goa—as if they would have gone away otherwise! It didn't occur to him the world would consider Indian leadership incompetent not to be doing what was in its national interest.

The "foreign-affairs expert" and "highly knowledgeable internationalist" didn't know that all countries had been using diplomacy, pressure and violence to achieve their goal; and that none achieved anything through love and non-violence and noncooperation. Even the Indian independence was NOT on account of the Gandhian non-violence and non-cooperation; but on account of other reasons (please check the author's book 'Revealing Facts about India's Freedom Struggle' available on Amazon). While Nehru's tame Gandhian approach yielded no positive benefits, it made the issue more and more complicated and difficult to resolve as the time passed.

Ultimately, after a lapse of fourteen long years after independence, India had to use violence to liberate Goa.

During a long discussion on Goa in the Foreign Affairs Committee in 1950, Sardar Patel kept to himself listening to the various tame

alternatives, then suddenly said at the end, "*Shall we go in? It is two hours' work!* " {RG/508} 'Nehru resisted this suggestion vehemently…'{RG/508} Patel was very keen to fulfil the assurance given to the Goa Congress in his letter of 14 May 1946 promising freedom from foreign domination. *Patel was all for using force to settle the matter quickly. But, Nehru was too lacking-in-action to take any effective steps. Patel felt exasperated* .
