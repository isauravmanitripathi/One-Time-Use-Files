# Sardar vs. Nehru's Socialistic Nightmare

### Theory of Non-Affluent Society

Marxism and socialism were something Nehru was sold out on since the 1920s, wrote approvingly about in his books, advocated vigorously all through, and, unfortunately for India, implemented it post-independence in his own Nehruvian way.

Nehru stuck to his position on socialism and communism despite the increasing evidence of their global failure, and the immense misery and totalitarianism they brought about. And, despite irrationally and unscientifically ignoring the facts and evidence, he flaunted himself as of a rational and scientific temperament.

For anything to be scientifically correct, it has to be proved truly and convincingly in practice, without a shadow of doubt. Till the same is done, it remains merely a conjecture, a hypothesis, a theory. *Has the so-called scientific socialism or Marxism proved successful anywhere in the world in practice?* No.

Facts, figures, statistics and ground-level experiences of various countries prove that all brands of leftist politics—Communist, Socialist, Fabian, Nehruvian, and so on—are inherently incapable of delivering anything positive for any nation or for its poor. In fact, they have actually been at the root of poverty, want and stagnation.

*Dismal fate of all nations that went socialist proves the point.* Take USSR. It claimed to be following *scientific* socialism or Marxism. But, what were its practical results? It drew an iron-curtain so that no one got to see the disaster: the wide-spread poverty and famine and suppression of human rights. Had things been really good, why would USSR be so secretive about it, and not let those interested journalists, writers, academicians, researchers, politicians, sociologists, and general public—have unrestricted access and see

the state of affairs for themselves, especially when they wanted other nations to emulate them, and go communist! Why only guided tours, under strict supervision? Whom were they fooling?

Perhaps people like Nehru. One guided tour in 1920s, and Nehru returned fully sold out, like school-boys taken on guided tours! Subsequent guided-tours of both Nehru and his daughter postindependence to the USSR, and both were re-sold!! Ultimately the USSR fell apart, and all its parts are still struggling to throw away the bad old days of communism.

Nehru wrote in 'Discovery of India':

"…I had no doubt that the Soviet Revolution had advanced human society by a great leap and had lit a bright flame which could not be smothered, and that it had laid the foundations for that new civilization towards which the world could advance."{JN}

Contrast this with what Bertrand Russel had to say after his visit to Russia:

"…the time I spent in Russia was one of continually increasing nightmare. I have said in print what, on reflection, appeared to me to be the truth, but I have not expressed the sense of utter horror which overwhelmed me while I was there. Cruelty, poverty, suspicion, prosecution formed the very air we breathed. Our conversations were continually spied upon… There was a hypocritical pretence of equality… I felt that everything that I valued in human life was being destroyed in the interest of a glib and narrow philosophy, and that in the process untold misery was being inflicted upon many millions of people…"{BNS/191-2}

Ultimately the USSR fell apart, and all its parts are still struggling to throw away the bad old days of communism. Millions died from hunger and famine in Soviet Russia, yet the communist leadership did not have the heart to save them by seeking help from outside, lest the outside world became aware of the pathetic conditions. Same with China under Mao—about 40 million perished in famines!

Country-wise unofficial estimates of the total number of persons who perished thanks to communism, through man-made famines

and state-terror, as per The Black Book of Communism are: USSR– 20 million, China–65 million, Cambodia–2 million, North Korea–2 million; the world-total being around 100 million! Compare this with the estimate of Holocaust victims at about 6 million, and total World War II military deaths of all countries put together at about 25 million.

Take the case of East Germany: contrast it with the prosperity in West Germany. Why the Berlin Wall ultimately fell? See the fate of the East-European countries: Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania. Consider the case of Albania under its Mao— Enver Hoxha. What of Cuba under the "great" revolutionary, Fidel Castro: it is now desperately trying to shed its socialistic past. Note the growing economy of Vietnam after the gradual shedding of its communist policies. The terrible fate of Cambodians under the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot—brought out so chillingly in the movie, The Killing Fields! Appalling conditions in North Korea: George Orwell's "1984" continuing in the 21st century!

There is not a single example of a country which prospered or whose poor were better off under communism or socialism. The democratic countries like the UK which were going downhill with their socialistic policies did course correction under Thatcher and prospered. Near home, see the unfortunate and the pathetic fate of India and its poor thanks to India's socialistic policies, which are only gradually getting dismantled.

#### Democracy and Socialism: Are they compatible?

Many say they don't like capitalism, but they want democracy. Many talk of democratic socialism. But what is the historical origin of "democracy"? Did socialism give rise to democracy? Did communism give rise to democracy? No. Historically, all socialist and communist societies have curbed freedom, democracy being a far cry. Did a feudal system or a monarchical system or a dictatorship give rise to democracy? No.

It was the mercantile-industrial capitalism that led to democracy. Democracy and capitalism go together. Competitive capitalism needs democracy to thrive. Vice versa, democracy can thrive where

competitive capitalism exists. Of course, vitiated forms of capitalism, like crony capitalism, can go along with dictatorships and oligarchies.

However, socialism and communism, where the state dominates and predominantly controls the means of production, can't have real democracy, because true democracy is unsuited to those systems. That's why when India went more socialist under Indira resulting in difficult economic conditions, she had to wind up democracy and declare Emergency.

It's not as if there is a menu of systems, and one can choose which to adopt. Constructivism does not work in the field of economics. A set of complex economic, mercantile, industrial, societal, survival, cultural, psychological and organisational factors have led to the evolution of free enterprise and capitalism. Free enterprise and capitalism were not something that were first theorised, then planned, and then implemented or rammed down. They evolved as a sequence of civilisational growth, were taken cognizance of, and then theorised after the fact. Facts and practice led to the theory, and then the theory enhanced the practice. Thereafter, it was a beneficial evolving cycle, each helping enhance the other. Democracy, in turn, evolved out of free enterprise and capitalism; and again there was a cyclical effect between the two, each helping enhance the other.

In comparison, there is nothing natural, organic or evolutionary about Socialism, Communism or Gandhiism. They are all artificial constructs. You first theorise. Then you plan how the theory could be implemented in practice. And, when you implement you find there are just too many variables, too many unknowns, and too many practical difficulties and unforeseen human factors and frailties to contend with. Russians tried it for over 70 years, failed, reverted, and have since been struggling to implement capitalism. Same with the East European countries that went communist thanks to Russia. China wisely junked its Maoism before it was too late, and steered itself capably into a version of capitalism.

Gandhiism! Nehru, Gandhi's chosen disciple, shuddered even to try it, despite Gandhi's persuasion. It is another matter that Nehru tried another bad artificial prescription—imitating the Soviets. In fact,

Gandhi could not implement his own prescriptions satisfactorily even in the restricted environment of his own ashrams.

## Nehruvian Socialistic Suicide

Nehru uncritically accepted socialism. It is strange that while Nehru's books approvingly talk of Marxism and socialism, there is no comparative analysis by him of much more proven competing economic thoughts. It was as if Adam Smith, Alfred Marshall, JS Mill, John Maynard Keynes and others did not exist for Nehru. Nor did he care to read Milton Friedman (1912–2006) or Friedrich Hayek (1899–1992). Nehru just went by what was popular and fashionable among the upper classes in Britain, without any deep study of economics (despite many years in jail where he had all the time in the world, and access to books), or even a reasonable or understanding of its basics, although economics is a most vital subject for any political leader. Economics is a serious subject for its affects the lives of millions, and for Nehru to take up a firm position on one trend of economics without critical appraisal of the alternatives was not only unwise in the academic sense, it proved disastrous to the nation in practice.

Further, even if Nehru mistakenly believed that communism was doing good for one country, the USSR, how was it that he did not notice the many countries prospering under capitalism, like the US, the Western-European and the South-East Asian countries. Was Nehru, the "scientifically-minded" person, going more by personal bias, whims and fancies, rather than by facts!

As the Nehru years rolled by, the numbers started causing concern, state of the nation went from bad to worse, and famine conditions developed. Scientific thinking, of which Nehru was a passionate advocate, demands that you take facts and statistics seriously, analyse data, find the reason, check where you have gone wrong, find what other countries are doing and succeeding, and do a course correction. But, since you were never genuinely scientific in the first place, where was the question of any course correction? You and your socialism and your path could not be wrong. You cannot

lose face. Persist. Invent excuses: Public Sector is not supposed to make profit!

Although one can't doubt Nehru's good intentions, one can't ignore the fact that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

Post-independence, and till the early 1950s, India did command great respect and prestige around the world, and there were lots of expectations from democratic India as a beacon for other developing countries, particularly the erstwhile colonial ones, to follow. Unfortunately, Nehru's policies proved so disastrous on the ground that all hopes stood belied. Nehru's socialism delivered a monumental tragedy lacking not only in growth and poverty alleviation, but also in delivering social justice.

Nehru, through his anti-private-sector policies, throttled industrialisation. Although, in comparison with the deliberate neglect in the British period, the progress in industrialisation during the Nehru period was much better owing to significant public sector investments. British set up or allowed setting up of only those minimal things that helped them in their trade, business and greed not what was required for a country like India.

Post-independence industrialisation was also helped by the very significant second world war sterling debt repayments by the UK, and aid by other countries like the US, the USSR and Germany. However, when the repayment of the sterling debt by the UK tapered off, and not much further foreign aid was forthcoming, and the public sector into which Nehru had sunk the investment was either in loss or not able to generate adequate surplus, the industrialisation momentum began to taper off, as there were no funds; and given Nehru's socialistic approach, the private sector was anyway shackled!

Further, not learning anything from Japan and others, who had dramatically prospered with their outward-looking, export-led growth, India under Nehru went in for inward-looking, import-substitution model, denying itself a world-class, competitive culture, incentive for production of quality products, share in the world-trade, and the consequent prosperity.

Instead, India invested heavily in the inefficient public sector,

over-regulated and strangulated private enterprise, shunned foreign capital, and ignored better technology. India under Nehru also neglected the two vital sectors—agriculture and education.

Investment in the public sector leviathan was a huge two-thirds of the country's investable funds during Nehru's time, but to little avail the public sector churned out shoddy goods and remained in loss. Of the entire paid-up capital in India, the share of the public sector rose to a massive 70% by 1978, with little benefits accruing to the nation. Our extremely scarce resources were squandered and precious public money was literally burnt by the Dynasty in trying to do business; while the sectors for which a government is primarily responsible remained neglected, and were starved of funds.

The Western-European countries devastated by the Second World War—particularly West Germany, which was reduced to rubble—recovered from the ashes, progressed and became highly prosperous. Japan was totally ravaged by the War and the Atomic Bomb. Remember that Raj Kapoor song of the fifties, "Mera joota hai Japani ..." pointing to the torn shoes, representing the condition of Japan then. Japan systematically went about regenerating itself economically—something that Nehru should have copied. Japan first made education universal and compulsory. Agriculture was then modernised. Infrastructure—roads, rails and telecommunications was drastically improved; and all villages were linked. First light industries, and then heavy industries were established. Thanks to these measures, Japan recovered quickly, and grew at over 9% for over twenty-three years, to become one of the largest economies of the world. India, in contrast, was untouched by the war and the devastation. Yet, India remained a poor third-rate third-world country unable even to feed its hungry millions.

Why did India fail? There are any number of convenient and false explanations: problem of national character; people not being hardworking; lack of discipline; colonial baggage; democracy, which is "soft"—what is needed is dictatorship, preferably military dictatorship. Those who advance such pleas should be asked: "Why is the economy doing relatively much better now? Have the lazy of the old days suddenly become very hard-working? Has the national character changed for the better? Are people now more disciplined?"

The real reason for the woes had nothing to do with those factors. It was a plain, bad, borrowed Nehruvian economic model of socialism that did us in.

What They Said of Nehru & Socialism

This permit-licence-raj is not a bee in my bonnet but a great boaconstrictor that has coiled itself around the economy.

*—Rajaji in Swarajya of 15.1.1966* {RG3/415}

Poor countries are poor because those who have power make choices that create poverty. Such countries develop "extractive" institutions that "keep poor countries poor".

*—Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson, 'Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity and Poverty'*

Socialist institutions tend to be extractive. Nehru was the founder of the extractive institutions that have been at the root of India remaining a third-rate third-world nation.

> To cure the British disease with socialism was like trying to cure leukaemia with leeches. *—Margaret Thatcher*

Raja Vyapari taya Praja Bhikhari. —*Indian proverb*

The whole political vision of the left, including socialism and communism, has failed by virtually every empirical test, in countries all around the world. But this has only led leftist intellectuals to evade and denigrate empirical evidence… …When the world fails to conform to their vision, then it seems obvious to the ideologues that it is the world that is wrong, not that their vision is uninformed or unrealistic.

*—Thomas Sowell*

If the future is full of hope it is largely because of Soviet Russia. *—Nehru*

If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there'd be a shortage of sand. *—Milton Friedman*

> A young man who isn't a socialist hasn't got a heart; an old man who is a socialist hasn't got a head. *—David Lloyd George, the British PM in 1920*

People who believe in evolution in biology often believe in creationism in government. In other words, they believe that the universe and all the creatures in it could have evolved spontaneously, but that the economy is too complicated to operate without being directed by politicians.

*—Thomas Sowell*

Mr Jawaharlal Nehru returned from Cambridge with notions of how an all-governing interventionist state can force people into happiness and prosperity through socialism...He sticks to this bias in spite of the demonstration of world experience against it... I hate the present folly and arrogance as much as I hated the foreign arrogance of those [British] days."

*—Rajaji* {RG3/378}

Nehru's inability to rise above his deep-rooted Marxist equation of Western capitalism with imperialism, and his almost paranoid, partly aristocratic, distrust of free enterprise in its most successful form as 'vulgar', cost India dearly in retarding its overall development for the remaining years of his rule, as well as for the even longer reign of his more narrowly doctrinaire daughter.

*—Stanley Wolpert, 'Nehru: A Tryst with Destiny'* {Wolp2/447}

He [Nehru] had no idea of economics. He talked of Socialism, but he did not know how to define it. He talked of social justice, but I told him he could have this only when there was an increase in production. He did not grasp that. So you need a leader who understands economic issues and will invigorate your economy.

*—Chester Bowles, the then US Ambassador to India*

While I usually came back from meeting Gandhiji elated and inspired but always a bit sceptical, and from talks with Jawaharlal fired with

emotional zeal but often confused and unconvinced, meetings with Vallabhbhai were a joy from which I returned with renewed confidence in the future of our country. I have often thought that if fate had decreed that he, instead of Jawaharlal, would be younger of the two, India would have followed a very different path and would be in better economic shape than it is today. {BK2/v} {Lala/174}

*— JRD Tata*

Sardar Patel vs. Socialists

The socialist-communist bug had started bugging several Indian leaders since the 1920s. Many fell for it out of a fashion. It was "progressive", "forward-looking", "scientific-minded", "pro-poor", "on the right side of evolving history" to be so. Nehru, who knew or understood next to nothing on economics, also fell for it: it made him look intellectual and pro-poor, even as he lived like an aristocrat (on his father's money)—imitating British upper class leftists! How the failed idea of the 19th century became so appealing is a mystery. Illiterates in economics fell for it, and even now fall for it!

Socialistic wordings crept into the pronouncements of the Congress when its Karachi resolution of 1931, drafted, inter alia, by Jawaharlal Nehru committed itself, among other things, to "state ownership or control of key industries and services".

After Nehru became Congress president in 1936, he extolled the virtues of socialism at the Lucknow session of the Congress. In the Congress Working Committee of 14 Nehru [as President] had included 3 socialists: Jayaprakash Narain (JP), Acharya Narendra Dev and Achyut Patwardhan. Subhas Bose too was there. Soon after, Nehru had begun to sing socialism in party forums.

This led to an acrimonious exchange between Patel and Nehru. Patel objected to Nehru championing a creed of socialism which the Congress had not even accepted. Sardar chastised a group of Congress politicians for "*claptrap, catchwords and mere learned talk* " {Grov/373} when they initiated the *Congress Socialist Party* as a faction within the Congress in 1934. Sardar frankly told Acharya Narendra Dev what he thought of the Socialists. Patel described the Congress

Socialists as mere '*sappers and miners* ' of the Communist Party. Socialists Minoo Masani, Jayaprakash Narain and others who used to be with Nehru later realised the truth of Patel's statements. Socialists controlled about a third of the delegates in AICC, and along with communists, they had planned to capture Congress. But, Patel stood like a rock, and frustrated their efforts.

However, at that time, in the 1930s and 1940s, the opposition to socialistic-communistic creed by the stalwarts like Gandhi, Patel, Rajaji, Rajendra Prasad was unfortunately not as well-grounded, and not as effective, as it should have been. The virus was not nipped in the bud through an informed debate, and that led to its spread. Gandhi & Co lacked the intellectual rigour to squarely deal with the question. When Nehru, Socialists & Co strutted around showing themselves as intellectuals, radicals and progressives; rather than exposing them, Gandhi & Co went out of their way to show that they were more socialistic—simple living, no property, working for the good of the public, particularly the poor. They were indirectly extolling socialism! They were assuming socialism-communism was pro-worker, pro-peasant and pro-poor, and that its proponents believed in simple living; when it was actually the reverse.

Rather than showing Nehru & Co the error of their ways on socialism–communism, Gandhi humoured Nehru. Gandhi & Co only pointed out the socialists were trying to move too fast. They wanted a step at a time. First gain independence, then do the rest. And, of course, avoid class war. They never attempted to show that socialism and communism were bogus solutions to end poverty; and that even after independence it would be foolhardy to adopt socialistic creed. There was enough material available, and sufficient examples, to expose the socialistic-communistic creed, but Gandhi & Co did not study or analyse them, or make use of them.

Emboldened by Nehru as the Congress President in 1936, the socialists–communists also wanted to actively meddle in the affairs of the Princely States. You are not able to do enough to get rid of the British from British India, but you want to poke your nose in the over 500 Princely States too! Irresponsibility and Socialism–Communism– Nehruvianism went hand in hand. Nehruvianism was more a show off as something radical to remain popular, particularly with the

young. Gandhi disapproved of meddling in the Princely States; and so also Patel. Thanks to the same, Patel could ensure merger of all the Princely States into India; while Nehru badly messed up the only Princely State he had taken (rather, usurped) charge of, namely Kashmir.

Nehru led the country down the socialistic quagmire once the opponents of socialism like Sardar Patel and Gandhi were no more. Sardar Patel had remarked that "*a government which engages itself in trading* [read business] *activities will come to grief* "{PNC/V-15/2} .

In his book 'The Great Divide' HV Hodson claims that in the list of the cabinet submitted by Nehru in August 1947, Sardar Patel's name was initially missing! There could have been three reasons for it [not given in that book]: *One* , Nehru feared Patel would oppose his socialistic policies. *Two* , Patel commanded much greater support and respect and had the power to have Nehru's policies out-voted. *Three* , Nehru, the "great democrat", wanted to have only his way, and didn't wish to share power.

Sardar Patel never believed socialism was a panacea like Nehru and many other socialists, including Jayaprakash Narayan and Rammanohar Lohia, believed. Sardar was liberal enough to even offer a deal to the socialists on these lines: "*Select a province and run it on socialist principles. If they did better than others, he would gladly hand over the country to them* ."{RG/491} The offer was not taken, as JP and Lohia later recalled.

Said Sardar: "*Unlike many who indulge in the parrot-cry of socialism, I have no property of my own. Before you talk of socialism you must ask yourself how much wealth you have created by your labour… By experience, I am convinced that what is necessary for us is to learn how to produce more wealth and then to produce wealth and thereafter to think what to do with it* ."{SP3}

Though Patel openly befriended Birlas and businessmen, he was independent of them. He never sought personal favours from them either for himself or for his family. He led a simple life. Even though Patel was a very successful lawyer earning substantially, once he got into the Freedom Movement, he gave up everything. Sardar was the epitome of Gandhian simplicity. He used to say: "*Bapu has told*

*that those in politics should not hold property, and I hold none* ." His only daughter Maniben stayed in a one-room apartment till her death in the 1980s. Patel was unlike the Leftists who took money from the capitalists and abused them. Patel was unlike the Nehrus who lived it off royally.

Sardar Patel had little patience with socialists: he found them to be mostly just talkers, and with as many sub-groups as the subcastes in India. He had commented at the end of 1934: "*There are 84 castes among Brahmins whereas, it would seem, there are 85 different types of socialists* !"{RG2/L-4243} He was also averse to an organised socialist sub-group within the Congress.

Raising the dual membership issue, Patel had persuaded the Congress Working Committee (CWC) in 1948 to amend the party constitution to prohibit the existence of other parties with "a separate membership, constitution and programme" within the Congress, resulting in the exit of the Congress Socialist Party (CSP) from the Congress. Socialists, including CSP, were close to Nehru, and this move came in the way of Nehru imposing his complete domination on the party organisation.

It is also worth noting that unlike Nehru, who grew up enjoying an aristocratic life; who even later "*was completely out of touch with the Indian life even of his time, except with the life of the self-segregating Anglicised set of upper India who lived in the so-called Civil Lines* " {NC2} as Nirad Chaudhuri describes in his 'Autobiography of an Unknown Indian, Part-II'; and for whom Socialism, Communism, Fabianism were more of academics, and devices to appear learned and empathetic towards the poor, and were, in realty, tools to become popular and garner votes; Sardar Patel came from poor, peasant background; was a rooted peasant leader thoroughly familiar with the lives and problems of farmers and peasants; had successfully led several notable peasant agitations against the British; and was among the very first Congress leaders to get associated with Ahmadabad's Textile Labour Association back in 1917, much before Gandhi's non-cooperation movement commenced. He was the Chairman of BB&CI Railway Workers Union in 1920. Patel was too rooted to get into the airy nonsense of socialism that ultimately condemned India to remain a poor, hungry,

third-rate, third-world country, even as socialists and their dynasties enjoyed a good lifestyle.

He wanted industries to spread and grow, as he believed "no country can prosper without industries; nor can labour, in the modern sense, survive without industry."{SP3} While he wanted industrialists to realise that the "labour is a driving force for the stabilisation of freedom; and no Government can afford to ignore what should be due to them"{SP3} ; stressing the necessity for first creating wealth before it could be distributed, he told labour "if there is no water in the well, none can draw any to drink." On socialism-nationalisation, he commented, "Nationalisation is worthwhile only if we can manage to run industries. We have neither men nor the resources even to run our administration."{Grov/205} Of course, nationalisation and state and public-sectors have since amply proved in practice, not only in India, but globally, that even if you have the men, money and resources, it is disastrous for any country to make business its business—which Nehru-Indira Dynasty did.

During his inaugural address at 'Indian National Trade Union Congress' (INTUC) Session in Indore on 6 May 1949, Sardar Patel said, inter alia: "…Some people want the Government to run everything, leaving out the capitalists. But the Government of India today has not the resources to run all industry by itself. If we try, we will not be able to run it for twelve months, and we will incur losses. We have to act with discretion…" {SP3}

While Patel looked upon socialists as immature and misguided romantics, and hence didn't consider them as foes; he intensely disliked communists, and had a contempt for them. He considered communists to be trouble creators spreading disaffection and violence, having extraterritorial loyalties, being dictated by people outside India, and betraying the interests of the country, and working at cross-purposes with whatever was in the interest of the Indian people, their freedom, and prosperity.

On 11 November 1949, addressing a conference of businessmen, industrialists and labour leaders, Sardar Patel offered a practical solution to the country's economic problems saying that "the key to our economic situation lies in increased production". Said Patel:

"Spend less, save more and invest as much as possible, should hence-forward be the motto of every citizen in the country and all of you must see that it becomes the guiding principle of your life. You can select for yourself any suitable means of investment which are open to you, but only make sure that all the money that you save is spent for national cause."

Sardar Patel was not in favour of nationalisation, public sector, and socialist system. He favoured private players and liberal economic policies. Sardar's economic model comprised three pillars: Industrial Growth, Promotion of Private Entities, and Liberal Government Policies. Ideas of Sardar Patel ultimately came as reforms of 1991, though not wholly.

Here is practical example of Sardar's wise approach, and Nehru's unwise socialistic fad. Wrote Durga Das{DD/317} :

"…What mainly derailed businessmen politically was the action the government took against firms suspected of evading taxes. Liaquat Ali [then Finance Minister in the joint Congress-League government under Nehru as the PM in 1946-47] had proposed a commission of inquiry and drawn up a list of about 150 business houses under suspicion. [This Liaquat Ali of the Muslim League had done deliberately to hit at the financiers of the Congress; but Nehru was too full of himself to understand the implications]. This action paralysed business leaders and most of them never recovered from the shock.

"Sardar Patel told me that businessmen offered to settle their dues collectively by depositing Rs500 million [a big amount then] in the exchequer. This would have enabled them to bring out their black money and use it legitimately.

"Patel favoured the deal because he wanted business to play its full role in activating the country's economy [a very sensible suggestion]. But Nehru, for reasons of ideology [which later took India to dogs], would not listen to him. The result was that not only did black market money not come out but it kept multiplying. [That's what happens: socialist policies always result in the opposite of what they claim to intend.]"{DD/317}

Had Sardar Patel's Free Market Economy Model been adopted,

India would have been a prosperous, first-rate, first-world country by 1980!

#### Sardar's Role in White Revolution

The idea of co-operatives for milk industry was the brainchild of Patel. He was instrumental in motivating farmers to join the cooperative movement so as to break the monopoly of middlemen in milk collection and distribution, and place the power in the hands of the farmers and milk-producers.

Once when a delegation of Gujarati farmers came to him citing their inability to send their milk production to the markets without being fleeced by middlemen, Sardar Patel advised them to organize the processing and sale of milk by themselves, and guided them to create the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers' Union Limited, that came to be known as AMUL. He further advised that the cooperative should have its own pasteurization plant. In fact, Sardar Patel had advocated farmers' co-operatives as early as 1942.

Once the villagers agreed to Sardar's proposal, Sardar sent Morarji Desai, his trusted deputy, to Kaira District to organize milk cooperative. Desai held a meeting in Samarkha village on 4 January 1946, and resolved that milk producers' co-operative societies would be organized in each village of Kaira District to collect milk from their member-farmers. All the milk societies would federate into a Union which would own milk processing facilities. This marked the beginning of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers' Union Limited, later popularly known as Amul.
