# **Fundamental Rights** and **Directive Principles of State Policy**

# K C Markandan

The Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles had their roots deep in the struggle for independence. And they were included in the constitution in the hope and expectation that one day the tree of true liberty would bloom in India. The Rights and Principles, thus, connect India's future, present and past, adding greatly to the significance of their inclusion in the constitution, and giving strength to the pursuit of the social revolution in India.

In the Directive Principles, however, one finds an even clearer statement of the social revolution. They aim at making the Indian masses free in the positive sense, free from the passivity engendered by centuries of coercion by society and by nature, free from the object, physical conditions that have prevented them from fulfilling their best selves.<sup>1</sup> To do this, the State is to apply the precepts, contained in the Directive Principles when making laws. These principles are not justiciable, a court cannot enforce them, but they are to be, nevertheless, 'fundamental in the governance of the country'.<sup>2</sup> The essence of the Directive Principles lies in Article 38, which echoing the Preamble, reads:

The State shall strive to promote the welfare of the people by securing and protecting as effectively as it may a social order in which justice, social, economic, and political, shall inform all the institutions of a national life.

Although the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles appear in the constitution as distinct entities, it was the Assembly that separated them; the leaders of the independence movement had drawn no distinction between the positive and negative obligations of the State. Assuming that the constitutional conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy is real, one way to resolve it would be to study the background in which these rights and principles were incorporated in the original constitution with the actual intention of founding fathers in regard to them. Instead of doing that, the judiciary starting with the decision in the *Golak Nath* case (1967) (which put the power to amend the Fundamental Rights beyond Parliament's purview) chose to interpret the constitution according to their varying lights and in the process destroyed its intrinsic harmony. The executive and the legislature have, on their part, disfigured the document through a series of amendments calculated not so much to resolve the apparent conflict between the constitutional provisions, as to assert their own supremacy over the judicial arm of the government. The constitution has become a plaything in the hands of its own creatures, namely, the organs, institutions and functionaries provided by it.

The main question today is, how the constitution can be saved from further misinterpretation and mutilation. In fact, had the constitution been correctly understood, both in letter and spirit, no conflict would have arisen. The constitution is a sterling document drawn up after mature consideration by some of the best minds of the time. Some critics have called it a bagful of borrowings, a jumble of contradictions. But if they are borrowings, they have not been taken mechanically. In fact, the two most remarkable features about the content and style of the constitution are the precision in the choice of works and the avoidance of any redundancy.

It is less than charitable to assume that the founding fathers lacked the sense to realize that situations would arise when the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principle's might conflict. Article 31 includes the fundamental right to property enforceable in a court of law, while Article 39, clauses (b) and (c), provide for acquisition of property for the purpose of equitable distribution, but makes it non-enforceable in law. If this be a contradiction, a further question that arises is whether the judiciary, entrusted with enforcing Article 31 should prevent the executive and the legislature from performing their constitutional function under Article 39 (b)<sup>3</sup> and (c)<sup>4</sup> even when that function conflicts with Article 31. It was never the intention of the framers that what might appear in the context of today as an inevitable conflict to become a conflict at all. Their intention when they framed what appears to be "conflicting provisions" was that the judiciary would normally enforce the fundamental right to property under Article 31, but when the State chose to acquire property for purposes of equitable distribution under Article 39(b), the judiciary would, by a process of harmonious interpretation, allow the State to discharge its constitutional function, instead of asserting its own right to enforce the Fundamental Rights. In other words, the principle adopted was that the extent of the enforceability of Article 31 would depend on State action under Article 39(b) and (e). In fact, it was even thought of at one stage of the Constituent Assembly deliberations that an explicit provision should be made in the constitution that in the case of conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles, the latter should prevail.<sup>5</sup> But then this proposal was given up as unnecessary and redundant on the ground that the various organs of the government, created under the constitution, would be responsible enough to work in a complementary manner performing their prescribed functions without coming in conflict. Only, what was considered as redundant at that time has now come to be proved for in the constitution, although in a different manner and with a limited objective, in the shape of the new Article 31(c). This article enjoins that State action under Article 39(b) and (c) shall override the Fundamental Rights, more particularly the right to property under Article 31. To the extent state legislatures too are expected to follow the Directive Principles, the new Article 31(c) empowers these legislatures as well to make laws in pursuance of the Directive Principles, which would have an overriding effect on the fundamental right to property. In fact, it would be legitimate to extend the ambit of the legislative power under Article 39(b) and (c) even to municipal authorities because they are also instruments for implementing the Directive Principles.

The artificial nature of the present day conflict between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles would be clear if one looks into the historical circumstances in which they came to be incorporated in the constitution. The Fundamental Rights Sub-committee was entrusted with the task of framing the Fundamental Rights as well as the Directive Principles. It would be worthwhile to recall in this respect that both part III and IV were originally designated and drafted as Fundamental Rights. The Committee had a long list of rights including political, social, economic, and so on. A scrutiny of this list reflects that the rights fell into two categories: (1) those that could be assured to the citizens without any serious difficulty, and, hence enforceable in a court of law, and (2) those that were for some reason or other, difficult to be ensured and, therefore, impracticable to be legally enforced. It was clear that a special effort would have to be made by the government to secure the second type of rights for the citizens; as such, till these were capable of realization, there was no point in making them enforceable in a court of law. So, it was obvious that as and when the State was in a position to ensure to the citizens these rights (which were termed as the Directive Principles of State Policy) and laws were enacted for this purpose, they should become rights in the same manner as the Fundamental Rights. In other words, when the Directive Principles become realisable, they should also become enforceable. Thus, the intention clearly was to enlarge the chapter on Fundamental Rights by a progressive transfer to it from that part of the constitution dealing with the Directive Principles.

Strictly speaking, there is no conflict between the Directive Principles of State Policy as non-enforceable rights and Fundamental Rights as enforceable ones. The Fundamental Rights cannot be whittled down, but at the same time the purpose cannot be achieved by treating the Directive Principles as things of no consequence at all. It is here that courts on the one hand and the executive and the legislature on the other should endeavour to harmonize the Directive Principles with the Fundamental Rights. Positively also the Directive Principles enjoys a judicial status because of the nature of the principles contained in it. They being 'fundamental in the governance of the country', it devolves on the judiciary to see to their fulfilment. Also, as it is the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws, it is incumbent upon the judiciary not only to interpret the laws made thereunder but also to see to their faithful compliance.

Right from the time the constitution came into force, the State has been directing its policy towards the fulfillment of all the objectives contained in the Directive Principles of the State Policy with a varying degree of success. Generally speaking, there has been considerable amount of difficulty in securing the social ideals for more than one reason. For instance, some states are reluctant to introduce prohibition<sup>6</sup> for if they did so, it would suffer a serious loss in revenue which it could not otherwise offset. In the case of securing for the citizens a uniform civil code,<sup>7</sup> there is the difficulty of reconciling the vast number of varying practices. Adequate protection to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from social injustice and exploitation is difficult in view of the existing prejudices against them. Article 45 of the constitution envisages the provision of free and compulsory education for children up to the age of 14 years, within a period of 10 years from the commencement of the constitution. This object has not met with success, not so much because of slackness on the part of the central as well as the state governments, or non-availability of funds, but because of the following three factors beyond the control of the aggregate state:

- 1. Difficulties of bringing sufficient numbers of girls to school.
- 2. Extreme backwardness of certain areas and certain sections of the population in matters of education.
- 3. Wastage due to parents discontinuing their children from attending school immediately after they are able to earn for the family. For this reason, more than one-half of the children never reach class IV, and hence fail to gain permanent literacy.

The framers of the constitution were clear that though the Fundamental Rights could not be abridged or taken away by a law made by the State, they could be by an *amendment* of the constitution. Accordingly, the term "law" in Article 13(2) was not to take in, in its inclusive definition, an amendment to the constitution. The doubt over this kicked up in *Golak Nath's* case was not all that new. It needs to be recalled that to clarify this position, the Constituent Assembly unanimously decided on an amendment on 29th April 1947, to the effect that although the Fundamental Rights could not be abridged or taken away by law, they could nevertheless be curtailed by an amendment of the constitution.<sup>8</sup> It might then be asked why the constitution, as finally adopted, did not make this provision explicitly. The answer lies in the fact that the Drafting Committee which examined this matter found that such a provision was unnecessary in as much as no Article or part of the constitution was exempted from the purview of the amending clause of the constitution.<sup>9</sup> While the Fundamental Rights as incorporated in the constitution were not to be abridged or taken away, they were to be subject to the constitutional law. That was the reason why the term "law" was defined in Article 13, clause 3(a), rather elaborately. If this basic scheme of the constitution had been appreciated by the judiciary, they would not have gone the way they did in the *Golak Nath* case, nor would it have been necessary for the Parliament to bring forth a series of amendments to the constitution.

# **Directive Principles and Fundamental Rights—Written Words and the Spirit of the Constitution**

From the foregoing pages, it is reasonable to come to the conclusion that there cannot be a conflict between the Directive Principles of State Policy and the Fundamental Rights in the Indian constitution. The framers of the constitution had intended to provide these two chapters so that they may supplement and complement each other. This is evident not only from the records of the Constituent Assembly, but also from the written words and phraseology of the constitution. As already pointed out, the framers of the constitution had a long list of rights from which they have picked up some to be put in the chapter on Fundamental Rights and some others to be put in the chapter on Directive Principles of the State Policy. Since some of the rights could be ensured to the citizens without much difficulty to the individuals they have put them as Fundamental Rights and made them enforceable by the courts of law. As for the other set of rights, since they anticipated difficulty in ensuring them for the people of India straightway, the difficulties, such as finance, difficulties consequent on social customs and traditions, the founding fathers had thought of putting them in another chapter. Because of these difficulties, they further thought that it may be prudent to make them non-enforceable in the courts of law. Lest they should be looked upon by the judiciary as less important than Fundamental Rights, the framers of the constitution took a realistic view and made to Directive Principles non-enforceable in the courts of law. If the Fundamental Rights are important because they are so entailed, the Directive Principles are equally important because the framers have said that the Directive Principles are "fundamental in the governance of the country" and "it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws."<sup>10</sup> As a matter of fact, one could think of the Directive Principles as more important than Fundamental Rights, because the former are concerned with conferring certain rights for the society as a whole as against the latter which are concerned with the conferment of the rights for the individuals. Certainly society is more important than the individual. As the arguments presented above state, that truly speaking, the Directive Principles are more fundamental than Fundamental Rights from the point of view of the constitution since the ideas enshrined in it, 'Justice, Social, Economic, and Political', are loftier in conception and seek to secure to the individual tangible benefit of great significance than Fundamental Rights.<sup>11</sup> It was suggested by B.N. Rau that in case of conflict between Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles the former should be made subservient to the latter, otherwise the framers of the constitution might be accused "of sucking the Bill of rights".<sup>12</sup> Evidence to this effect which was the intention of the founding fathers is also available from the Constituent Assembly records. Sir B.N. Rau, to recall, suggested through an amendment, the incorporation of an Article as a preface to the chapter on Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy to the effect that as and when the two parts appear to come in conflict the Directive Principles would prevail.<sup>13</sup> This preface was not provided for in the constitution explicitly because it was felt by the founding fathers that it would be redundant. It was also felt that it would be quite obvious that the rights of the individual would certainly be less important than the rights of society and that in case of conflict, the individual rights should be subordinated to the social rights. Read in this context, it was certainly the intention of the framers of the constitution that the individuals had Fundamental Rights, but as and when the government of the day passed a legislation in order to confer a social right in pursuance of the Directive Principles of State Policy, the Fundamental Rights of the individual would cease to be operative. This was how the framers of the constitution wished the judiciary to view the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy. Unfortunately, however, as the judiciary could not appreciate this position and constantly took the view that the Fundamental Rights were more important than Directive Principles of States Policy, a conflict arose. To the judiciary the Directive Principles had not much of relevance viewed in relationship with the Fundamental Rights. This position, therefore, necessitated the constitution Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth amendments.

The above-mentioned amendments are in reality redundant and unnecessary, because what has been sought to be achieved by these amendments is already implicit. In fact, these amendments have been necessitated due to the interpretation of the judiciary contrary to the intention of the founding fathers. If these two amendments, although pointed out as redundant, had not been effected, there would have been a never-ending conflict between the judiciary on the one hand, and the executive and legislature on the other. The judiciary would always give primacy to Fundamental Rights and set aside relegating to the background Laws made by the executive and the legislature in pursuance of a Directive Principles of State Policy. The government, on the other hand, by amending the constitution would try to clarify the position.

The position of the Fundamental Rights *vis-à-vis* the Directive Principles of State Policy, therefore, appear to be that the Fundamental Rights should be enforced by the judiciary so long as they do not conflict with the Directive Principles of State Policy. But, once such a conflict arises, the judiciary ought to withdraw to allow the Directive Principles to prevail. Secondly, the Fundamental Rights should be enlarged by translating the Directive Principles into laws. Also, The Fundamental Rights could be whittled down or even totally effaced by an amendment of the constitution. It follows that the Fundamental Rights were not meant to be sacrosanct or transcendental. These were incorporated in the constitution of free India to signify, first, the emancipation of the country from the British rule and, secondly, the right of the minority communities to be protected against any possible tyranny of majority rule. Those who framed the constitution did not intend to pit these rights against the Directive Principles of State Policy. Rather, they expected that the organs of government would interpret and use these rights in a manner that would help implement the Directive Principles. The framers of the constitutions saw no incongruity, nor any possibility of a conflict, between Parts III and IV of the constitution. The Fundamental Rights embodied in Part III are intended to secure the main objectives of the constitution enumerated in its Preamble, that is*,* "social, economic, and political justice". These very words occur in Article 38 which is the main plank of Part IV thereby implying that there is no conflict between Parts III and IV.

# **Directive Principles of State Policy: Nature and Significance**

A novel feature of our polity is the inclusion of a chapter on Directive Principles of State or Social Policy as an integral part of the constitution. They are deliberately included by the framers of the constitution to bring about, primarily, a desired socio-economic pattern of society into existence.

# ❑❑ **Origins**

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the recognition of the Fundamental Rights of man, in the constitutions of states, became a general principle of constitutional law of the civilized states. The constitution of Egypt of 19th April and of Abyssinia of 6th July 1931 contained declarations of rights of individuals. The declaration of Fundamental Rights was also found in the Latin American constitutions. The enunciation of social and economic policies became a regular feature in the constitutions framed in the post-war years recognizing thereby that justice was to be secured not only in the political field for the individuals alone, but also in the social and economic spheres, for the society as a whole. The state was, therefore, called upon to play a more positive role to achieve the common good without sacrificing the good of the individual. The practice with regard to the enumeration of social and economic policies within the framework of the constitution has not been uniform. It has varied from country to country depending upon its social and economic progress.

## **Constitutional Precedents**

The constitution of the Principality of Liechtenstein<sup>14</sup> of 5th October 1921, and the constitution of the Spanish Republic of 9th December 1931, both professing the Roman Catholic religion are out of those constitutions which had provided for social and economic matters, and require special mention. In the constitution of Liechtenstein, the chapter commencing with the 'Directive' provides that the supreme duty of the State was to advance the public welfare, goes on to include in its fourteen articles, matters relating to education, public health, industrial and agricultural labour, public utilities, natural resources, currency, credit and taxation, poor relief, social insurance, and reform of the legal system. The Spanish 'directives' was an improvement on the Liechtenstein 'directives' in the sense that it broadened the 'directives' by including in matters relating to the family and culture apart from social and economic matters. The enunciation of social and economic policies, however, found a distinctive place in the constitution of Ireland which came into force on 29th December 1937.<sup>15</sup> A distinction was made in it between 'Fundamental Rights' relating to personal rights and other rights relating to the family, education, private property and religion and Directive Principles of Social Policy which contains social and economic matters. The Irish constitutional provisions relating to social and economic matters, thus, made a significant advancement<sup>16</sup> in this regard in comparison to other constitutions of the world. It made a distinction between justiciable and non-justiciable rights and found a place in the constitutional documents for non-justiciable rights which was till then unknown. The title given to the provisions of this chapter as "Directive Principle of Social Policy" and their being non-justiciable in character not only enlarged the scope of the 'Directives', but also it applicability.

# **Case for its Provision**

It is worthy to note here as to what principles should be kept in view while laying down the 'Directives' in the constitutional framework; what should be the basic contents; and in what manner should they be stated. First and foremost consideration is to avoid any sort of partisan zeal. Secondly, that 'Directives' should appeal to popular imagination. Thirdly, the 'Directives' should not occasion violent and lasting controversy. The function of the provision contained in the 'Directives' is to give a particularly solemn sanction and status to principles which are regarded of great importance. In regard to the content, it should be said that no model 'Directives' could be set for adoption by all countries. The most that could be done is to lay down

#### **112** ✽ CHAPTER 6

certain generally acceptable objectives. Writing about Indian 'Directives' Where says:

"Difficult to justify to the practical minded British observer, perhaps, is the large section embodying the 'Directive Principles of State Policy'. As these principles cannot be enforced in any court, they amount to a little more than a manifesto of aims and aspirations. In this matter of declarations of rights and of Directives of State Policy, the Indian Constituent Assembly has followed the Irish constitution and European practice rather than the less colourful and more legalistic documents which serve as constitution for other members of the Commonwealth.

One thing is certain. If these declarations of liberal principles, strange as they may seem in a legal document to British eyes, help the Indian constitution on its way and assist its people in working their government, they are more than justified. This is the biggest liberal experiment in the government of men by themselves that has ever been tried."<sup>17</sup>

Apart from the Irish constitution wherein the distinction between rights justiciable and non-justiciable were made, Sir. B.N. Rau also found a similar distinction recognized by Dr. Lauterpacht in his 'International Bill of the Rights of Man'. The substantial provisions of the Bill were in two parts; Part I dealt with rights meant to be enforced by the ordinary courts, and Part II dealt with rights incapable of or unsuitable for such enforcement. Impressed with that distinction in Fundamental Rights as justiciable and non-justiciable in the Irish constitution and reinforced by Dr. Lauterpacht's recognition of the same, Sir B.N. Rau suggested for adopting in the Indian constitution the Irish plan<sup>18</sup> and separating the two classes of rights: Part A dealing with Fundamental Principles of State Policy, and Part B with Fundamental Rights. The suggestion of Sir B.N. Rau could not find any acceptance for even if a list of rights could be prepared for inclusion in the Indian constitution to further divide them in to justiciable and non-justiciable rights was indeed a difficult task. The difficulty in dividing rights into justiciable and non-justiciable was also pointed out by the Sapru Committee.<sup>19</sup> Sir Alladi Krishnaswami Ayyar also stressed the need for making a distinction between rights which were justiciable and rights which were merely intended as 'a guide and directive objective to State Policy'. On the other hand, K.M. Munshi was not very particular in making any distinction between justiciable and non-justiciable rights and including the latter in the constitution. Ultimately, the Fundamental Rights Sub-committee resolved that a distinction should be made in the list of Fundamental Rights as justiciable and non-justiciable. The Subcommittee examined the Directive Principles of Social Policy on 30th March 1947. According to the first set of 'Directive Principles of Social Policy as framed on 30th March 1947 by the Sub-committee was: "The principle of Social Policy set forth, in this part, are intended for the general guidance of the appropriate legislatures and governments in India (hereinafter collectively called as the State). The application of these principles, in legislation and administration, shall be the care of the State and shall not be cognizable by any court.<sup>20</sup> On the next day, 31st March 1947, the Sub-committee decided to insert the following Preamble to the Directive Principles of Social Policy:

"The principles of social policy set forth in this part are intended for the general guidance of the State. The application of these principles in legislation and administration shall be the care of the State and shall not be cognizable by any court".<sup>21</sup>

The members went on to adopt the provisions based on Rau's draft of the effect that the State should raise the level of nutrition and the living standard of the people, and promote international peace and justice dealings between nations.<sup>22</sup> Certain changes and counter-changes were made during the next several weeks, but in general, the first stage of drafting the Directive Principles was over. The Minorities Sub-committee suggested two changes in the clause relating to non-justiciable rights as framed by the Fundamental Rights Sub-committee. Two other changes effected by the Advisory Committee in the list of non-justiciable rights recommended by the Fundamental Rights Sub-committee were (1) Clause 33<sup>23</sup> was given the sub-title 'Preamble' and the rest a subtitle 'Principles', and (2) the substitution of the world 'are not' for the words 'shall not be' in the second sentence of Clause 33.<sup>24</sup>

The second stage in the framing of the principles took place on the Assembly floor in November and December 1948, during the debate on the Draft constitution. An earlier debate-held in August 1947, on the occasion of Sardar Patel's presentation of the Advisory Committee's Supplementary Report, was of little consequence.

The assembly's attitude towards the draft revealed two major reactions: one that the Directives did not go far enough towards establishing a socialist state and the other that they should have placed greater emphasis on certain institutions. By November 1948, there were scores of amendments to the Principles as a consequence to these two major reactions. Some Assembly members sought to make the promotion of cottage industry a government responsibility and make it a duty of the State to prevent the slaughter of cattle and to improve animal husbandry and agriculture. In the Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar admitted, 'a considerable amount of feeling'<sup>25</sup> in favour of government encouragement for cottage industries, and this forced him to accept an amendment placing the promotion of cottage industries, and this forced him to accept an amendment placing 'the promotion of cottage industries' in the Directive Principles.<sup>26</sup> The provision pertaining to the improvement of agricultural and animal husbandry techniques and the prohibition of cow slaughter was also added. The prohibition of liquor and harmful drugs (*e.g.,* opium) also became a fundamental principle of governance.

The second major reaction to the draft principles was that they did not go far enough in encouraging a socialist society. In this respect, most of the amendments were voted down in the Assembly and in the Congress party meetings were withdrawn by the initiators. Those substantive amendments reaching the Assembly floor were not adopted because the majority of the members held with the 'oligarchy' that the Principles should be kept general, leaving enough room for the people of different ways of thinking to reach the goal of economic democracy.<sup>27</sup>

# **Nature of the Directives**

Chapter IV of the Indian constitution relating to the Directive Principles of State Policy was the subject of animated discussion in the Constituent Assembly. On the one hand, one member preferred to label it as "pious expressions" and "pious superfluities", another member characterized it as 'vague' and 'adrift'. A third linked it to 'a cheque on a bank payable when able' because of its non-justiciable and non-binding character, a fourth took it to be analogous to an 'election manifesto' and as such there was no place for it in the constitution, and a fifth member called its inclusion in the constitution as 'undemocratic' and 'opposed to parliamentary democracy' and went to the extent of suggesting its deletion from the constitution. On the other hand, Professor Shibban Lal Saksena<sup>28</sup> considered it to be 'an important chapter laying down the principles which would govern the policy of the State;' Pandit Thakur Das Bhargava<sup>29</sup> regarded it to be the 'essence of the constitution and justified the way the Directives were worded, and S.V. Krishnamurthy Rao<sup>30</sup> deemed it as containing 'the germs of a socialist government' and he said that the part relating to the Directives in the constitution should come in immediately after the Preamble.

One member went to the extent of pointing out that the chapter on Directives was "one of the most cardinal, important, and creative chapters of the constitution." Pandit Hirday Nath Kunzru<sup>31</sup> did not attach any 'value' to any of the Principles included in the Chapter on Directive Principles, and T.T. Krishnanamachari, a member of the drafting committee, preferred to label it as 'a veritable dustbin of sentiment.' V.S. Sarwate (United States of Gwalior-Indore-Malva-Madhya Bharat) was, however, inclined to believe that 'all the principles given in this chapter are of such a nature that they are fundamental, that they are basic, and that efforts to implement them to the fullest extent would have to the taken as long as society goes on.<sup>32</sup> Members also criticized the distinction made between justiciable and non-justiciable rights. For instance, Somnath Lahiri (Bengal, General) observed:<sup>33</sup>

"It is rather difficult to make a distinction between what are justiciable rights and what are not. For instance, when we make a provision that people should have the right to work, that is, unemployment should not be allowed to exist on our country, it would be social rights. If you make it an inalienable provision of our Fundamental Rights, naturally it will have to be justiciable. Similarly, take the question of nationalization of land. If one wants to say that the land belongs to the people and to nobody else, that would be a social and fundamental right no doubt...it will also be a justiciable right. Therefore, it is rather arbitrary to make any distinction between what are justiciable and what are social and economic rights".

Promath Ranjan Thakur (Bengal, General) said:

"I do not know why economic Fundamental Rights should not be included in these justiciable rights., Economic rights are essential while framing a country's constitution and they must also be made justiciable".<sup>34</sup>

Renuka Ray (West Bengal, General) said:

The provision that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law with the details about compensation when property was taken by the State for public purpose in accordance with law, should be put under directives and not under rights which are justiciable and enforceable in courts of law.<sup>35</sup>

Vishwambhar Dayal Tripathi also thought:

"There is no ground for thinking that the Directive Principles of State Policy as embodied in the Draft constitution would at all affect the future structure of society in India.'<sup>36</sup>

Members also expressed the view that in the absence of provisions in this chapter making it obligatory, it was quite possible that none of these provisions might ever be realized in their life time.<sup>37</sup> To overcome this difficulty, Krishna Chandra Sharma (U.P., General) suggested the addition of a provision to the Directives to the effect that any law made in contravention of these Principles shall to the extent be void'.<sup>38</sup> He added that it would give jurisdiction to a court of law, though only a negative right to the people, to move a court that a law which went against the interests of the people should be declared void. On 4th November 1948, Dr. Ambedkar merely stated what the Directives were like and justified their inclusion in the constitution.

From the discussion in the Constituent Assembly, the following points emerge in respect of the Directive Principles of State Policy:

- 1. That the Directives are like Instruments of Instructions to the legislature and the executive and as such could be justified for inclusion in the constitution;
- 2. That the Directives cannot or will not be ignored by any responsible government or any legislature elected on the basis of universal suffrage for the sanction behind them is not the courts but the electorate;
- 3. That the Directives lay down the ideal of economic democracy.
- Article 37 brings forth a three-fold characteristic of the Directives, namely;
- a. That the Directives shall not be enforceable by any court;
- b. That the Directives are fundamental in the governance of the country despite the fact that the judiciary cannot see to their effective compliance;

 c. That it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws.

As regards to the language used, it shows the binding nature of the duties of obligations of the State towards the constitution. Excepting for the language used in four Articles (Articles 43, 44, 45 and 51) the latter Part of Article 47 and the first part of Article 48, wherein the word 'endeavour' is used, it seems to be in the nature of Commands—institutional orders to the State asking it to perform certain specific functions, that is, social, economic, cultural, etc. The term, 'primary duties' indicates that the directives are a sort of duty is used in Article 47. The word 'strive', used in Article 38, was interpreted by Dr. Ambedkar to mean that it had binding character.<sup>39</sup> Judged in the context, therefore, the word 'endeavour' used in Articles 43, 44, 45, 51, and parts of Articles 47 and 48 would also mean that the State has got to put its best efforts in order to achieve the objectives mentioned therein.

It is important to take into consideration, how and for what purpose, the Directives came to be incorporated into the constitution, for assessing the nature and significance of the Directives.<sup>40</sup> It has already been noted that the Directives came to be incorporated in constitutions to ensure social and economic democracy in addition to political democracy. Directives partake the nature of the rights, but are different from the rights contained in the chapter on Fundamental Rights. Part IV confers on the people Positive Rights while Part III grants to the people Negative Rights, rights not to be harmed and it is easier for the law to prevent the infliction of harm than to enforce positive benefits. It is because of practical difficulty of enforcement of positive rights that Article 37 states that these rights 'shall not be enforceable by the courts'. It is undesirable for the court to order the state to do any particular work and the exchequer may not have enough money to implement them or pay damages for failure to do so. It is for this reason that Part IV has not set, save in one instance, namely, Article 45, a time limit for their fulfillment.

It is also worthy to recall that Part III and Part IV were originally designated as Fundamental Rights. The Fundamental Rights Sub-committee recommended 'the list of Fundamental Rights should be prepared in two parts, the first part consisting of Directive Principles of Social Policy.'<sup>41</sup> Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel also came to the conclusion that Fundamental Rights should be divided into two parts, the first part justiciable and the other non-justiciable.

To know the real nature and significance of these rights, all the above considerations have to be borne in mind. It is incorrect to consider them wholly as rights, duties, and obligations or even as principles though they partake the nature of each one of them. They are rights which the individual enjoys in his collective capacity by virtue of being a member of the Welfare State. Similarly, they are duties of the State to establish social order in which social, economic, and political justice would prevail. They are duties in the moral sense and the constitution enjoins that the State shall perform these duties in the absence of legal enforcement. Directives are not obligations merely though they partake its nature. It is not even mere principles as the heading shows, but unlike the principles, Directives are binding in character. Directives are in the nature of duties, which the constitution calls upon the State to perform to achieve a Welfare State. Directives aim at achieving social and economic democracy. They are directives from the constitution to the State, asking it to perform certain duties fundamental in character with the assurance that in the performance of these duties there shall be no compulsion by individuals acting through the judiciary.

Further, it could be said that some critics have given exaggerated importance to the statement that 'the principles enunciated in this part are not enforceable by a court of law' restricts the real nature and significance of the Directives in the Indian constitution. But, they seem to forget that there are such things like conventions in the constitutional matters and the same are not enforceable through courts and they are often of equal value and effect with legally enforceable principles. Today the generally accepted view is that a rule is a legal rule not because it is recognized by the courts of law, but because it prescribes a norm of conduct.

The significant expression contained in Article 38 "Justice, social, economic, and political" gives the proper key to the understanding of the nature and significance, on the base of which the entire structure of the Directives has been built. The Directives in the Indian constitution lend flexibility to the written constitution, by enabling it to adjust according to the circumstances. It was for this reason that the Prime Minister characterized the Directives as representing something "dynamic" as against Fundamental Rights which he said represented something "static". Directive Principles are the deliberate formulation of national policy. They were not formulated by any particular political party or any particular organ of the government, but by the representatives of a nation who assembled to lay down the constitution for the government of the country. They indicate to the people of the country as to what the State might do for them and what it seeks to achieve. Directive Principles also constitute a pledge by the framers of the constitution to the people of India and failure would bring not only breach of faith, but would also render a vital part of the constitution a dead letter. Truly speaking, the Directive Principles are more fundamental than Fundamental Rights from the point of view of the constitution since it contained the ideals, 'Justice, social, economic, and political'. It is for this reason that both in the Objectives Resolutions and in the Preamble to the constitution the ideal of "Justice, social, economic, and political" is mentioned prior to the securing of guarantees under Fundamental Rights.

Another important thing to be noted is with regard to the nature of Directives and that is their enunciation in a general and non-detailed way, unlike the other constitutions in which provisions of economic and social matters are laid in a detailed manner. It also lends flexibility to the constitution and enables different governments to achieve the ideas contained in the constitution with varying methods of approach without resorting to alterations and amendments in the constitution.

## **Analysis of the Articles**

There were initially sixteen Articles of the constitution, from 36-51 that dealt with the Directive Principles. The 42nd Amendment added three more articles, namely, 39A, 43A, and 48A; modified clause (f) to Article 39; and a small usual change in Article 49. These cover a wide range of state activity embracing economic, social, legal, educational, administration, cultural, and international issues.

Article 37 confers non-enforceable rights on any person and imposes non-enforceable obligation on the State. The principal object in enacting the Directive Principle appears to have been to set standards of achievements before the legislature and the executive, the local and other authorities, by which their success or failure could be judged. The key to the Directive Principles is found in Article 37 which states, "The provisions contained in this part shall not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws".

Article 38 provides that the State shall endeavour to promote the welfare of the people by effectively securing and protecting a social order in which social, economic, and political justice shall inform all the institutions of national life. Article 39 particularises certain objectives, it provides that the State should direct its policy towards securing the right of the citizens, men and women, to an adequate means of livelihood, that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community be so distributed as best to subserve the common good, that the economic system should not result in the concentration of wealth and the means of production to the common detriment, that there should be equal pay for equal work for both men and women; that the State should endeavour to secure the health and strength of workers, men and women, and to ensure that the tender age of children is not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age and strength, and that childhood and youth are protected from exploitation and from moral and material abandonment. Through the 42nd Amendment made in 1976, free legal aid was provided to those denied by reason of economic or other disabilities. These and other directions are designed in Part IV to bring about a Welfare State.

Article 40 directs that the "State shall take steps to organize village *panchayats* and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government".

Article 41 directs the State within the limits of its economic capacity and development to make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education, and to public assistance in case of unemployment, old age, sickness, and disablement and in other cases of undeserved want. Article 42 directs the State to make provisions for just and humane condition of work and maternity relief. Article 43 provides that the State should endeavour to secure to all workers, by legislation, economic organization, or in any other way, a living, wage, conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life, and the full enjoyment of leisure, and social and cultural opportunities. A new Article 43A, was inserted through 42nd Amendment to ensure through legislation .the participation of workers in management. Article 44 provided that the State should endeavour to secure a Uniform Civil Code for the citizens.

The Directive Principles lay considerable emphasis on education. Article 45 directs the State to make effective provisions for securing the rights to education. It directs that the State shall endeavour to provide within a period of ten years from the commencement of the constitution, free and compulsory education for all children less than fourteen years of age. The directive contained in Article 45 has not been fulfilled, though primary education has been made increasingly free and compulsory. Article 46 directs the State to promote special care, the educational interests of the weaker sections of the population, and in particular the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation. According to Article 46, the State was at liberty to do anything to achieve that object so long as no other provision of the constitution was contravened; but Article 46 could not override Articles 15(1) and 29(2), nor could an exception be read into those Articles in favour of the backward classes. It has been held that Article 46 did not permit the State to discriminate in favour of Harijans so as to contravene the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Article 15(1).

Article 47 directs the State to regard the raising of the level of nutrition and the standard of living of its people as among its primary duties. It deals not only with raising the standard of living of the people, but also directs that the improvement of public health should be a primary duty of the State and in particular, "the State shall endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medical purposes, of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health."

Article 48 directs the State for the organization of agriculture and animal husbandry. According to Article 49 it should be the obligation of the State to protect every monument, place and objects of national importance.

A new Article, 49A, was inserted during the 42nd Amendment. Under this Article, the State would endeavour to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife of the country.

According to Article 50, the State shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive. Many of the States have implemented this directive either wholly or in part. Article 51 directs that the State shall endeavour to promote international peace and security, maintain just and respectful relations between nations, foster respects of International law and treaty obligations, in the dealings of organized peoples with one another, and encourage the settlement of international disputes through arbitration.

# **Attitude of Executive, Legislature and Judiciary towards Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy**

It emerges from the foregoing discussion that the Fundamental Rights are in the nature of general duties which the State is obliged to perform for the benefit of the individual and that the Directive Principles of State Policy are in the nature of specific duties which the State undertakes to do for the good of the society as a whole. A conflict between the two sets of rights, either directly or indirectly, seems to be apparent. A conflict, even if it arises, becomes magnified indeed with the constitution of an independent judiciary charged with the function of safeguarding the Fundamental Rights of the Individual as against the duty of the legislative and executive organs of the government of looking after the welfare of the society as a whole. The judiciary might try to avoid a conflict by refusing to take cognizance of the Directives on the ground that they are non-enforceable in character but it would be drawn into it, for the simple reason that the Directives form a part of the constitution. A situation may arise when the State in due discharge of its duty, under the Directive Principles, may make law prejudicial to Fundamental Rights, or an aggrieved individual in support of his rights cites the Directive Principles. In either case, there is room for conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy or, in other words, between the executive and legislature on the one hand and the judiciary on the other. If such a situation arises that court is bound to give preference to the former for they are enforceable in character. The State, on the other hand, bound by its 'duty' would give preference to the Directives.

It should be pointed out that there is no inherent conflict between the rights contained in Parts II and IV and the attitude of the courts towards the directives would not have been so hostile if the real meaning of the words 'shall not be enforceable' used in Article 37 had been comprehended. When Sir B.N. Rau suggested the inclusion of these directives, he did not anticipate any conflict between the provisions of the two chapters, but with the elevation of the status of the 'directives' as 'fundamental in the governance of the country' and the substitution of the word 'duty' for the word 'care' left the possibility of a conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles. He, therefore, suggested that in case of conflict the 'directives' should prevail. The words 'shall not be enforceable' used in the chapter on Directives were not really meant to offend the judiciary or to restrict its ambit as the guarantor of the Fundamental Rights of the individuals. It is not correct to say that the judiciary being charged with the function of safeguarding the rights of individual would be oblivious to the rights of the society as a whole.

The occasion for a conflict between the 'Directive Principles' and the 'Fundamental Rights' however came before the judiciary for the first time in the case, *State of Madras vs. Champakam Dorairajan* in 1951.<sup>42</sup> The petitioner, a Brahmin lady, contended that the Madras Communal Government Order violated her Fundamental Rights under Article 15(1) which prohibits discrimination on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, and place of birth and Article 29(2) which protects the citizens from denial of admission into any educational institution. As against this, the State of Madras contended that such a discriminatory treatment was justified under Article 46 of Part IV which imposes a duty on the State to promote the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the population, and in particular, of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. In this regard, Chief Justice Rajamannar gave his view and Justice Viswanath Sastri supported his views by saying that Article 37 expressly states that the provision of Part IV shall not be enforceable by any court. The rights conferred by Articles 15(1) and 29(2) are made justiciable by Articles 32 and 226 of the constitution.

Justice Somasundaram, however, dissented from the other two judges and drew the attention of the latter part of Article 37 which emphasized the 'fundamental character' of the 'Directives'. He observed:<sup>43</sup>

"Article 46 of the constitution is a very relevant and important Article to be considered in this connection. This is placed in the chapter relating to Directive Principles of State Policy. Article 37 states that though the provisions in that part are not enforceable in court, nevertheless the principles therein are fundamental in the governance of the country. Article 46 may not override Articles 15(1) and 29(2) in Part III. Articles 15(1) and 29(2) must be read with Article 46 of the constitution. In distributing the seats, State can take into account the fundamental principles embodied in the Article which it cannot ignore."

The Supreme Court rejected the above contention and held:<sup>44</sup>

"The chapter of Fundamental Rights is sacrosanct and not liable to be abridged by any legislative or executive Act or order, except to the extent provided in the appropriate Article in Part III. The Directive Principles of State Policy have to conform to and run subsidiary to the chapter of Fundamental Rights".

In *Om Parkash vs. State of Punjab*<sup>45</sup>, 1961, the Punjab High Court rejected the contention that the provision of Part IV could not be enforced by any court, Article 46 could not override Article 29(2); and the High Court of Bombay in *Jagwnat Kaur vs. State of Bombay*, <sup>46</sup> 1952, following the Supreme Court's decision in the Champakam Dorairjan's case, 1951, subordinated the Directives to Fundamental Rights. The following points, therefore, emerge from the above decision:

- 1. The Directive Principles of State Policy cannot override the provisions in Part III as the latter are made enforceable by appropriate writs or orders or directions under Article 32, whereas the former are expressly made unenforceable by any court.
- 2. The chapter on Fundamental Rights is sacrosanct and not liable to be abridged by any legislature or executive Act or order, except to the extent provided in the appropriate Articles in Part III.
- 3. The Directive Principles of State Policy have to conform to and run subsidiary to the chapter on Fundamental Rights.
- 4. The State action under Directive Principles is subject to the legislative and executive powers.
- 5. The State action under Directive Principles is also subject to the limitations conferred on the State under different provisions of the constitution, an inference of which there is no basis.

In other words, the attitude of the judiciary towards the Directives was not only to make it subordinate, but also not to give effect to it if it came in conflict for the mere reason that the Directives are 'not enforceable' in a court of law. Thus, the Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in *Fram Nusserwanji Balsara vs. State of Bombay 1950*, <sup>47</sup> wherein the legislative competence of the Bombay Legislature to enact the Bombay Prohibition Act in view of Article 47 was questioned held that Article 47 could not confer legislative competence where it was otherwise lacking. In *Ajaib Singh vs. State of Punjab*, <sup>48</sup> 1952, when Article 51 was cited in support of the petitioner's contention, Justice Bhandari of the Punjab High Court held that "Article 51 cannot empower the Parliament to make a law which can deprive a citizen of India of the Fundamental Rights conferred upon him".

In *Biswambhar vs. State of Orissa*, <sup>49</sup> 1953, when Article 51 of Directives was cited, Narasimhan, CJ., observed that Article 51 being in the chapter dealing with Directive Principles is not enforceable in this court in view of the express bar of Article 37."

The verdict of the Supreme Court in the *Champakam Dorairjan's* case resulted in the amendments of Article 15 of the constitution. Thus, although the Supreme Court had given its verdict, subordinating the Directive Principles to Fundamental Rights on the interpretation of the clause 'not enforceable in the courts of law' Parliament by amending the constitutional provision relating to Fundamental Rights impressed upon the judiciary that in the view of the State the Principles enunciated in Part IV, were more sacrosanct than the rights contained in Part III and in case of conflict between the two Parts, the latter has to yield to the former. After the amendment, however, the Courts could not reconcile with the discrimination in educational matters under Article 46. Article 31 was thrice amended (First, Fourth, and Seventeenth, to give effect to agrarian and economic reforms envisaged under the Directives in Article 39, and more especially in 39A).

It is worthy to note, however, that after the first and fourth amendment there was increasing recognition of the fact that although the Directives were non-justiciable in character, the courts were to recognize their importance for the reason that the Directives formed a vital part of the constitutional document. The Directives were no longer to be set aside or ignored when it came into conflict with Fundamental Rights. In *M.H. Quareshi vs. State of Bihar*, <sup>50</sup> 1958, the Supreme Court maintained that although the Directives should conform to and run subsidiary to the chapter on Fundamental Rights, it would not reject the Directive Principles, but would give it a harmonious interpretation provided that the Executive and the Legislature do not take away or abridge the Fundamental Rights while implementing the Directive Principles.

While in the cases discussed in the preceding paragraphs, the outlook of the judiciary in regard to Fundamental Rights vis a-vis the Directives came up in the first instance before the High Court, the Supreme Court was directly confronted with the question four times till this day. For the first time, the question came up on the case *Shankri Prasad vs. Union of India and the State of Bihar 1951*. <sup>51</sup> In this case, the validity of the constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, which inserted, *inter alia,* Articles 31A and B in the constitution came to be questioned. This amendment was made under Article 368 of the constitution by the Provisional Parliament. The Supreme Court held in that case (Patanjali Sastri, J., speaking for himself and Hiralal, C.J., Mukerjee, Das, and Chandrasekhra Ayyar, J.J.) that Parliament had power to amend Part III of the constitution. The Court came to that conclusion on two grounds, namely: (1) the word 'law' in Article 13(2) was one made in exercise of legislative power; and (2) there were two Articles, i.e., 13(2) and 368, each of which was widely phrased, and, therefore, harmonious construction required that one should be so read as to be controlled and qualified by the other, and having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the judgment. Article 13 must be read, subject to Article 368.

The question came up for the second time in *Sajjan Singh vs. State of Rajashtan*, <sup>52</sup> 1964 in the context of the validity of the constitution (Seventeenth Amendment) Act. The Supreme Court by a majority of 3:2 (Gajendragadkar, CJ., Wanchoo, and Raghubar Dayal, J.J.) for the majority and Hidayatullah and Mudholkar, J.J. for the minority upheld:

- 1. The correctness of the decision on Sankari Parsad's case although the correctness of the decision in that case was not questioned;
- 2. That the Seventeenth Amendment did not require ratification under the provision to Article 368 because of its indirect effect upon Article 226, etc.; and
- 3. That the power conferred by Article 368 included the power to take away Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Part Ill; that the power to amend was very wide and could not be controlled by the literal dictionary meaning of the word 'amend' and the word 'law' in Article 13(2) did not include amendment of the constitution made in pursuance of Article 368. Therefore, they doubted the competence of Parliament to make any amendment to Part III of the constitution.

#### **124** ✽ CHAPTER 6

The question came up for the third time in the case of *Golak Nath and others vs. the State of Punjab*<sup>53</sup> in connection again with the constitutional validity of the constitution's Seventeenth Amendment. Opportunity, therefore, was availed of to constitute a Special Bench of eleven judges of the Supreme Court to consider the correctness of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Sankari Parsad's case, which was accepted as correct by the majority in Sajjan Singh's case.

The Supreme Court, in its judgement in the Golak Nath's case, delivered on 27th February 1968, by a majority of 6:5 held *inter alia*: (1) that Parliament has no power to amend any of the provisions of Part III of the constitution so as to take away or abridge the Fundamental Rights enshrined; (2) that amendment is 'law' within the meaning of Article 13(2). Actually, there were two judgements on behalf of the majority and three on behalf of the minority. Subba Rao, C.J. on behalf of himself, Shah, Sikri, Shelat, and Vidialingam, J.J. held:(1) that the power of the Parliament to amend the constitution is derived from Articles 245, 246, and 248 of the constitution and not from Article 368 thereof which only deals with procedure. Amendment is a legislative procedure; (2) that amendment is law within the meaning of Article 13 of the constitution and therefore, it is void; and (3) that the parliament will have no power from the date of their decision to amend any of the provisions of Part III of the constitution as to take away or abridge the Fundamental Rights enshrined therein.

The judgement in the *Golak Nath's* case resulted in a serious situation, apart from the fact that the interpretation of the Supreme Court was erroneous. To get over this difficulty and to show what exactly the spirit of the constitution was, the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth amendments to the constitution were affected. The Twenty-fourth amendment to the constitution is the result of the Supreme Court's judgement in *Golak Nath's* case. In it, the Supreme Court reversed its previous judgement by a narrow majority, its own earlier decisions upholding the power of Parliament to amend all parts of constitution including Part III relating to Fundamental Rights. The constitution's Twenty-fourth Amendment<sup>54</sup> had made five changes in the basic document:

- 1. A new clause is added to Article 13 to the effect that Article 13 would not be a bar to amendment of Part III of the constitution under Article 368.
- 2. A new clause is added to Article 368 emphasizing the fact that Article 13 would not debar the amendment of the constitution, including Part III, sought to be made under Article 368.
- 3. An alteration in the marginal heading to Article 368 provides not only the procedure for amendment of the constitution, but also empowers Parliament to amend the constitution.
- 4. A clause is added to Article 368 specifying clearly, that under the constitution, Parliament could, in the exercise of its constituent power amend by way of addition, variation or repeal any provision of the constitution in accordance with the procedure laid down under Article 368.

5. A clarificatory provision is made in the existing provision to Article 368 to the effect that it would be obligatory on the part of the President to give assent to a constitution Amendment Bill when it is presented to him after it had been passed by the two Houses of Parliament and in cases where ratification by the requisite number of State Legislatures is required, after that had been obtained.

The Twenty-fifth amendment in effect wrote into the constitution that in case of conflict between the Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles of State Policy, the latter shall prevail. The Twenty-fifth amendment shut out the jurisdiction of the court by holding that once a legislation was declared to be in pursuance of the implementation of the Directive Principles of State Policy even if it conflicted with any Article relating to Fundamental Rights, the courts could not entertain the case. Under the Twenty-fifth amendment, it was possible even for the State Legislature to override Fundamental Rights if it sought to implement the Directive Principles of State Policy. However, a distinction was made between the power vested on the Parliament and the power vested on the State Legislatures in the matters of giving primacy to Directive Principles of State Policy. Whereas, in the case of Parliament a mere declaration by it that a contemplated legislation was for the purpose of implementing Directive Principles of State Policy was sufficient to shut out the court's jurisdiction, in the case of the State Legislatures, it was necessary of the State Legislatures that a declaration so made shall be approved and assented to by the President of India.<sup>55</sup>

The *Golak Nath* judgement and the 24th and 25th constitution Bills which sought to nullify its effect came up before the Supreme Court's scrutiny in the *Kesavananda Bharati's* case is 1973. The Special Bench held by a majority of 7 : 6 on 24th April 1973, that the constitution empowered Parliament the right to alter, abridge or abrogate the Fundamental Rights guaranteed by the constitution. The Court held that the part of the constitution (Twenty-fifth) Amendment Act, 1971, establishing the primacy of the Directive Principles of State Policy of the Fundamental Rights in respect of certain articles was valid although the second part of the Act which said that 'now law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy' was held to be unconstitutional and void. In other words, 'the Supreme Court for the first time accepted the primacy of the Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights', rejecting, however, the denial of the Court's jurisdiction to pronounce its verdict on the validity of law passed in pursuance of the Directive Principles of State Policy.

While partial primacy of Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights came about as a result of the Fundamental Rights cases, its total primacy came about in an entirely different manner and under altogether different circumstances. It was made a part of a package of comprehensive constitutional changes brought about through the constitution (42nd) Amendment and during the period of emergency. The clamour for constitutional changes came in the wake of Allahabad High Court's judgement, setting aside the election of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to the Lok Sabha in 1971, and, consequently, Parliament enacting the constitution (Thirty-ninth) amendment empowering it to set up a new forum for resolving disputes relating to the election of the President, Vice-President, the Prime Minister, and the Speaker. During the consideration of the Thirty-ninth Amendment Bill, the Law Minister Gokhale observed that the time had come to have a fresh look at the whole fundamental structure of the constitution so that it could be altered to meet the changed circumstances. A constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, however, unanimously upheld on 7th November 1975, the election of Indira Gandhi to the Lok Sabha, setting aside the High Court judgment of 12th June.

Meanwhile, in a submission made by the Central Government that the 1973 judgement of the Supreme Court in the *Kesavananda Bharati's* case, holding that the basic structure of the constitution could not be altered or reviewed, a full Bench of the Supreme Court was convened on 10th November 1975. The plea taken for the review was to decide a large number of cases involving nationalization of coal mines, textile units, and sugar factories as well as court jurisdiction in disputes involving administrative personnel. On 12th November, however, Chief Justice A.N. Ray announced that the review bench had been dissolved.

Three new Directives were added to the existing Directive Principles through the constitution (42nd) Amendment. Those were:

- 1. *Article 39A—Equal Justice and Free Legal Aid:* The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on the basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.
- 2. *Article 43A—Participation of Workers in Management to Industries:* The State shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way, to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organizations engaged in any industry.
- 3. *Article 49A—Protection and Improvement of Environment and Safeguarding of Forests and Wildlife:* The State shall endeavour to protect and to improve the environment and safeguard the forests and wildlife in the country.

Article 39A reflects the increasing recognition of the fact that legal aid is now regarded as an essential part of the administration of justice. In England, the first Legal Aid Act was passed on 30th July 1949.

Article 48A reflects an increasing awareness of people all over the world of the need to preserve the environment from pollution, especially in the urban areas. Smoke, industrial waste, deleterious exhaust fumes from motor cars, and other combustion engines are injurious to the health and well-being of the people and foul atmosphere. The preservation of forests and their renewal by afforestation has long been recognized in India as of great importance both with reference to rainfall and to prevent erosion of the soil by depriving it of forests which protect it. The preservation of wildlife is looked upon as necessary for the 'preservation of ecological balance.'

The Janata Party which came to power in 1977 sought to confine, through Clause 8 of the constitution (44th) Amendment Bill, 1978, the protection afforded to Article 31 C only to laws giving effect to the policy of States towards securing the Directive Principles specified in Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 39. This would have had the effect of restoring that Article to the form to which it stood before the amendment made to the Article by the 42nd Amendment Act. But, this part of the Bill which was adopted by the Lok Sabha on 23rd August 1978, was rejected by the Rajya Sabha. So much so that in the 44th Amendment Act as finally adopted by the Parliament on 7th December 1978, this provision remained unaffected.

The judiciary still clings to the basic feature argument and despite the 42nd amendment, has held in Minerva Mills and Vaman Rao's cases that the primacy of Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights in its entirety cannot be sustained.

The government's attitude was also the verdict of the Supreme Court in Minerva Mills and Vaman Rao's cases in the matter of primacy of the Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights needs a comment. A careful reading of the statement of objects and reasons of the 44th Amendment Bill would reveal that their difficulty in accepting the primacy of the Directive Principles over Fundamental Rights was that it was affected through an amendment during "emergency" and not during the normal circumstances. The revival of basic structures are meant on the part of the judiciary in the aforesaid cases was for the same reason. The taste of the emergency, it should be remembered, was too bitter to be forgotten for both the judiciary and the government. In short, their non-acceptance of the primacy of Directive Principles is due to political reasons rather than to legal and constitutional.
