# **Education in India**

### Sonali Chitalkar

ritish rule in India has been interpreted in various ways in the overall pframework, within which colonialism and imperialism have been understood. This framework ranges from the 'political economy' approach of Adam Smith and Ricardo and includes the Marxist-Leninist interpretations of imperialism and colonialism. Significant advances in understanding colonialism were made by Hobson, Hilferding and Luxemberg, After World War II and the national liberation movements which followed, most former colonies won national independence. This led to the dissolution of empires and to the end of colonialism. Most post-war Marxist approaches to imperialism consider that ex-colonies and developing countries are still subordinated to imperialist countries through dependency relations. Thus, a special type of development of the countries dependent on imperialism is the characteristic of the international capitalist division of labour within the framework of the world capitalist system. The dependence created by colonialism is still manifested in all the key spheres of the developing countries' economic life. Dependency theories, the world-systems theories of hegemony, in the world economy have all illuminated current concerns with imperialism and colonialism.

Though different in nature and content, almost all these understandings centre on the link between colonialism and the development of capitalism. Interpretations of colonial education policies, had for a long time, curiously glossed over this link. For instance, in India, colonial education policies were rather simplistically linked to the British need for a 'brown sahib' to aid in the administration of colonial India. This essay sketches how notions like that of a 'brown sahib' was one of the many desired outcomes of colonial education policy in India. British education policy was a part of the overall colonial enterprise which was essentially rooted in the then current liberalcapitalist political philosophies. The achievement of freedom from British rule did not end this association. It is argued that post-colonial education policies are also an extension of colonial education policies in a neo-liberal manifestation.

### ❑❑ **Education Policy Under Colonial Rule**

#### **The Beginnings**

Till the English victories in the Battles of Plassey (1757) and Buxar (1764), the English East India Company was a trading body. It was not interested in social reform and education in India, which were largely missionary concerns. The Charter Act of 1813 was significant not only for restricting the Company's monopoly over Indian trade but also because it provided a sum of one lakh rupees annually to be 'set apart for the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of indigenous sciences among the inhabitants of British territories in India'. The focus in this period was on the Indian knowledge and science and not on European education. The Charter of 1813 is considered significant as an enunciation of the principle of State responsibility for education in India.

#### **Between 1823 and 1835**

This clause of the Charter Act of 1813, however, remained inoperative till 1823 when the famous Anglicist-Orientalist erupted over the content and medium of education in India. The former pushed for the promotion of English and modern education, while the latter for Oriental subjects and vernacular languages. Macaulay's minutes of 1835 settled the controversy in the favour of the Anglicists.

 The teaching of English started in several Government schools and colleges after the establishment of the General Committee of Public Instructions (GCOPI) in 1823. This Committee drew up a plan for establishing a preparatory English school in every district and a College in every division. Whereas the schools were supposed to teach English, the colleges were expected to impart education in European knowledge and science.

A radical change was introduced in the education policy of the then Government of India, when Macauly assumed the Chairmanship of the GCOPI following the 1833 Charter of the Company. As has been mentioned already, Macauly advocated a more aggressive policy for teaching English and European knowledge and science, gradually replacing the teaching of Sanskrit, Arabic and other local languages by English and prohibiting the publication of books relating to oriental learning. After his proposals were approved by Lord William Bentick in 1935, schools and colleges teaching English and European knowledge and science became entitled to receive Government aid. This inevitably had an adverse effect on the traditional educational system in India.

#### **Wood's Dispatch and After**

A significant development, in the effort to spread English education and teaching European knowledge and science, was the Charles Wood's dispatch of 1854, the highlights of which were:

- The purpose of education in India would be the spread of European knowledge and science.
- Oriental learning was not necessary for progress; vernacular education would continue to get Government aid.
- English would be the medium of instruction in higher classes.
- Each Presidency would have a Department of Education under a Director of Public Instructions. Under him would be various Inspectors of Schools.
- A University would be established in each of the Presidency towns of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras.
- Government grant would be available to only those schools which provide secular education and which are under Government inspection.
- Educational qualification would be an important condition for appointment to Government jobs.

It would be significant to pause and unravel colonial education policies in the light of these seven significant policy declarations on education that have been mentioned above.

The year 1830 in England saw the ascendency of the Whigs (referred to as the Liberal party after 1834) came to power. This political change had significant impact on India. Though the construction of the 'colonial citizen' was already under way, through the development of railways and telegraph, education policy in India served to nourish its liberal roots in England. Thus much of the content and form of colonial education policies can be understood if we appreciate that 'the state's role according to liberalism was to assist civil society to fulfill its goal of ensuring individual rights, particularly the right to hold and increase property'. Thus the cultivation of a colonial citizen, through the formation of a civil society in India, of the type that existed in England, became the core enterprise of colonial education policy. What was this colonial citizen and how was he similar to his English counterpart?

In England, the idea of a civil society and the ideal of rational behaviour was a valued ideal. Its most central tenet was that 'rational behaviour meant translating the concern for the safety of property into the desire to strengthen the State's efforts to establish order'. Education policy in India was structured to facilitate this process in the colony. However, 'in India … the dream of the English bourgeoisie merely provided the vocabulary with which a miniscule civil society could legitimize its rise in the midst of exploitation of the working population'.

Thus the language of 'mass education', 'civil society' and 'citizen' used in policy in colonial India 'gave a very long life to eighteenth century English diction, in which 'people' and 'citizen' meant only men of status or property.

Hereafter two core themes emerge in education policy in India and they carry forward to present day education policies. The first was the division that colonialism engineered in India, between the small educated elite which was the beneficiary, 'the citizen' in colonial India and the masses. The other was the gender dimension of education policy in colonial and independent India.

The main education policies after the Woods dispatch were as follows:

- The Education Commission of 1882 also called the Hunter Commission
- The Universities Commission of 1902
- Government Resolution on Educational policy in 1913
- The Calcutta University Commission of 1917
- The Hartog Committee of 1929
- The Sapru committee in 1934
- The Aboot-Wood report 1936-37
- The Zakir Hussain Committee report 1937
- The Sargent Report of 1944

The main policy framework that is indicated in these reports leads to the emergence of the following themes in policy.

 Firstly, a gradual withdrawal of the State from the direct support and management of institutions of higher education can be evidenced. Secondly, there is evidence of tracking into vocational and technical education as a separate stream for those who were unfit for general education. Thirdly, with the exception of the Zakir Hussain Committee's Report and the Sargent Report, policies focused on the development of secondary and higher education thus privileging the already privileged classes who had benefited from colonial education policies. This was not a policy without deeply iniquitous outcomes. It led to 'the unplanned, haphazard and indiscriminate expansion of secondary and higher education'.

Overall, India has been more successful in meeting secondary and higher education targets rather than primary education goals. Literature touts this as an achievement.

This 'achievement' is again a reflection, of the social, political and economic forces at work. Thus 'the class-base of political power naturally led to a greater emphasis on secondary and higher education which benefit the 'haves' rather than the 'have nots' so that the expansion programmes at these stages received early attention, greater priority and more adequate allocations than those of mass education.'

The Zakir Hussain Committee deserves special mention in policy as it stands out as the only colonial education policy recommendation that attempted to reorient colonial education policy towards the benefit of the masses rather than the colonial elite. It focused on free and compulsory education for seven years and on a nation-wide scale envisioned that the medium of instruction be the mother- tongue. The scheme of education suggested by it is popularly known as the "Wardha Scheme", the main features of which are as follows-

● A Basic Craft was to serve as the centre of instruction. The idea is not to teach some Handicraft side by side with liberal education, but a craft or vocation was to become the basis of education;

- The core of the Wardha scheme was that it was supposed to be self-supporting to the extent of covering teachers' salaries and making pupils self-supporting after the completion of their course;
- Manual labour was insisted on so that every individual may learn to earn his living through it in later life;
- Pedagogy was closely coordinated with the child's life, i.e., his home and village crafts and occupations.

The Gandhian vision of education proposed by the Wardha scheme was promptly disowned both by the colonialist and nationalist discourse. Since 'nationalist discourse drew heavily from the Brahmanical tradition it could not provide room for non-esoteric forms of knowledge' as proposed by Gandhi. Further, 'practioners of the nationalist discourse, as it matured towards Indian Independence could afford to be paternalistic in the style of English administrators'. This paternalism is observed in post colonial education policies in India.

#### **Educational Policy in Independent India**

After independence, the University Education Commission of 1948 was appointed by the Government of India under the Chairmanship of Dr. S. Radhakrishnan. The Commission made important suggestions for improving the standard of university education in the country such as the introduction of a three-year degree course for the first university degree, greater use of tutorial system of instruction, formulation of new aims, emphasis on developing critical thinking. The Radhakrishnan Commission had surveyed the field of secondary education in a passing manner and had admitted that 'our secondary education remains the weakest link in our educational machinery and needs urgent reform'. This fact was the reason d'être of an All India Commission for Secondary Education appointed in 1952 under the chairmanship of Dr. A. Lakshmanswamy Mudaliar.

However, between these two commissions came the forty-fifth amendment to the Indian constitution, 1949, which states 'The State shall endeavor to provide, within a period of ten years from the commencement of this constitution, for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years'. All subsequent policy formulations in education need to be seen against this amendment.

The Mudalair Commission of 1952 offered a number of suggestions to adjust secondary education with the new goals and needs for free India. The aim was now to train youth for intermediate leadership and for democratic citizenship. Secondary education was to be a terminal stage for a large majority of the nation's youth, who would take up their places in society after their school education and provide leadership to the general masses. The Commission was equally concerned with qualitative improvement of the schools. To develop individual talent, curricular offerings were extended and diversified. To achieve the new aims of education, changes in methods of teaching were suggested. New trends in examination, guidance and extracurricular work were brought into the school programmes. Multipurpose secondary school was a new concept recommended by the Commission. Inclusion of craft, social studies and general science in the curriculum was aimed at orienting students towards an industrial and science-centred democratic life.

The Government of India in October 1964, set up the Kothari Education Commission, to deliberate on the national pattern of education and on the general policies for the Development of education at all stages ranging from the primary to post-graduate stage and in all its aspects, besides examining a host of educational problems in their social and economic context.

Based on the recommendations of the commission, the National Policy on Education, 1968 was passed by the Government of India. The National Policy of 1968 marked a significant step in the history of education in post-Independence India. It aimed to promote national progress, a sense of common citizenship and culture, and to strengthen national integration. It laid stress on the need for a radical reconstruction of the education system, to improve its quality at all stages and gave much greater attention to science and technology, the cultivation of moral values and a closer relation between education and the life of the people.

However the most significant aspect of the 1968 policy was the promise of schooling of equitable quality for all. The Common School System was accepted in the first National Policy on Education-1968 (i.e., NPE-1968) in order to 'equalize educational opportunity for all children and to promote social cohesion and national integration'. Subsequently the National Policy on Education 1986 made the following commitment:

*The concept of a National System of Education implies that, up to a given level, all students, irrespective of caste, creed, location or sex, have access to education of a comparable quality. To achieve this, the Government will initiate appropriately funded programmes. Effective measures will be taken in the direction of the Common School System recommended in the 1968 policy.* (National Policy on Education-1986, Section 3.2 also retained in the policy revised in 1992).

It is in the background of the National Policy on Education 1986 that a dichotomy between policy and practice in education is revealed.

Gradually through practice there was the abdication of constitutional obligation and steady dilution of policy relating to free education of equitable quality. The policy framework of NPE-1986 and the programme design of POA-1986 and Programme of Action 1992 contained the promise of school education of equitable quality for all, was 'designed to basically promote exclusion of crores of children from elementary education and introduce inequality by institutionalizing low-quality multiple tracks or parallel streams of education. It was this character of NPE-1986 that provided both the foundation and the necessary socio-political space to international funding agencies, including the World Bank, to exacerbate abdication, accelerate the pace of exclusion and further marginalize people's aspirations for a Common School System and genuine Neighbourhood Schools'.

Thus the NPE, 1986, institutionalized non-formal education for out of school children and girls who could not come to formal schools, permanently relegating them to the margins of the educational and social system.

The next big policy formulation in education has been the Right to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE, 2009). In conceiving the RTE Act, has perpetuated the differential tiers of schooling institutionalized by the NPE 1986. As a result, children of different sections of society have access to varying quality of schooling in accordance with their socioeconomic status or ability to purchase schooling in the market. This is evident from the very definition of "school" in clause (n) of Section 2, which provides for four categories of schools of varying quality and provisions.

The Act insists on compartmentalizing the fundamental right to education of every child from 6 to 14 years in these categories. For instance, Section 5 provides for the right of the child to seek transfer to another school under certain circumstances. However, at the same time, it restricts the right of the child to seek transfer to schools of "specified category" (that is, Kendriya Vidyalayas, Navodaya Vidyalayas and other similar elite schools) and private, unaided schools.

This implies that the majority of the children in the 6-14 age groups shall be denied education in schools which the State itself considers, rightly or wrongly, as providers of higher quality education. This goes against the very basis of education as a Fundamental Right.

In the Act there is the provision of 25 per cent seats being reserved in schools of "specified category" and inprivate schools, aided or unaided (Section 12), for "children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group in the neighborhood". This amounts to the declaration that at present private schools are not only of higher quality compared with Government schools but shall remain so even after the Act is implemented.

### **Elementary Education Policy in India**

The neo-liberal agenda on education can be most clearly seen in elementary education in India. Firstly, the Government of India announced a proposal (September 2009) to set up model schools under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Model. Secondly, Public expenditures on education in general and particularly on elementary education in India are steadily showing a declining trend.

The privatization agenda is being pursued in elementary education on the basis of empirical research is that in no way justify policies for privatization. Such empirical researches selectively highlight deficiencies in public school education. It is important to understand how a 'coalition of interests' are engaging in the alteration of common sense in elementary education in India and effectively pushing privatization and school choice policies.

The arguments for privatization of elementary education are organized around four key issues. The key claim is that a large and underestimated private sector already exists in elementary education in India. The importance of this sector is underlined by showing that this sector is popular amongst the poor. A group of studies demonstrate that private schools are more effective and efficient and finally that the efficiency of this sector rests on lower relative costs.

It is estimated that a very large number of private un-recognized schools exist that are not counted.

The importance of this sector is demonstrated by studies which say that in urban India, Government and aided schools together absorbed only 39 per cent of the new primary enrolment over the period. The remaining 61 per cent is being absorbed in low fee paying private schools. With regards to the popularity of these schools amongst the poor, findings from the MIMAP survey, 1996 in India show that, of all school-enrolled, children aged between 5-10 years old living below the poverty line, 14.8 per cent attended private schools (8 per cent in rural and 36 per cent in urban India). These findings have been supported by Pradhan and Subramaniam (2000), PROBE Team (1999) and by Tooley and Dixon (2003) for Andhra Pradesh. These studies demonstrate that the use of private schools is greatest at the primary level.

One of the focal points in the literature favouring privatization is that private schools are more effective in terms of achievement. This conclusion is reached on the basis of survey results based on standardized testing. Private schools are considered more efficient in terms of controlling teacher absenteeism etc. Teacher absenteeism is identified as one of the major problems in Government schools.

Lastly, a major point of debate is the lower cost advantage of private schools. This is mainly due to market-clearing teacher salaries and lower cost per unit attainment. Attainments in these studies are measured on the basis of standardized testing on small sample surveys.

Most of the studies described above are looking at cost advantage from the supply side. The main cost component used is teachers salary and Pupil Teacher Ratios. It is more accurate to look at demand side costs for private schools. Not doing so may conceal higher complementary costs (e.g., textbooks, private tuitions, capitation, extra-curricular, rents illegally siphoned off by private managements etc). Most important, average cost incurred by the households on tuitions fees is likely to be high as compared to cost calculations based on teachers' salaries. Similar conclusions have been reached by an important group of studies that have undertaken demand side computation of cost. Household survey in Rural Areas reveals that private education is more costly, in rural areas. It is worth noting that in urban areas this figure might be higher.

An Eight-State survey of schools and households is revealing in terms of quality of schooling. In the eight states surveyed, almost 90 per cent students go to government schools except in UP (73 per cent) and TN (74 per cent). Pupil Teacher Ratios's are high in government schools.

Government schools also have a higher percentage of trained teachers. A comparison can be made by looking at the percentage of untrained teachers in government schools with private schools. In Andhra Pradesh there are only 8.6 per cent untrained teachers in Government schools whereas there are 62 per cent untrained teachers in private schools. In Assam the same ratio is 32.5 per cent as compared to 75 per cent. Similarly in Bihar it is 1 per cent as against 68 per cent. In Madhya Pradesh the same ratio is 18 per cent and 74 per cent. Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal reveal similar trends.

The same study also reveals that private schooling is a burden for households.

Thus per pupil cost advantage of private schools, claimed by many studies may be washed away, if we look at demand side measures and use differential measures for computing cost of private and public schooling.

As mentioned above a number of studies demonstrate that almost 15 per cent of all school-enrolled children aged between 5-10 years old living below the poverty line are opting to study in low-cost private schools. Further it is asserted that 61 per cent of all the increase in total primary school enrolment in the period 1986-1993 was 'absorbed' by private schools. Both these assertions are significant if taken at face value. Especially if almost one-seventh of the BPL population in India finds private sector education a better option than public schools then it an obvious matter of concern.

The veracity of BPL estimates is a disputed fact for India. In India, the official poverty estimates dropped from 37.6 per cent in 1993-94 (NSS–50th Round) to 27.7 per cent (NSS-55th Round). However, experts estimate higher levels of poverty for the NSS-55th Round. Based on expert estimates, India's corrected headcount ratios for the 55th NSS Round ranges between 30.6 per cent and 37.1 per cent. There is indeed a large gap in the estimates provided officially and those by the experts. Popli use parametric, semi-parametric and non-parametric approaches to obtain the headcount measure of poverty for the year 1999-2000 based on Household Expenditure Survey data of 1993-94 and show that there is a decline in India's poverty by about 5 per cent, which is less than that estimated officially (9.9 per cent).

Thus not only are BPL estimates skewed, studies show that these are biased as well. The major issue is the implementation of the census in which there is high level of exclusion of the genuine poor households from the BPL list, thereby leading to under-representation and mis-representation in identification of poor households and distortion of ground realities. Ground level studies in west Bengal have shown how the implementation of the BPL Census has been blatantly managed in favour of non-poor households by the Panchayats.

Thus, the sweeping conclusion is that low-cost private schools are preferred by the poor especially that BPL is a sweeping conclusion to say the least. Are those opting for low cost schools really BPL?

Further data on absorption of new enrollees utilized by Kingdon was examined where simulations have been used to project the astounding figure of sixty-one per cent for urban India. Firstly this needs to be weighed against the availability of public schooling in the area. Secondly, simulations in themselves are a crude tool of estimating increase in enrolment. The response of enrolment to population growth both in the private and public sector are not as causally defined or as simplistic as demonstrated by Kingdon.

One of the major points for critique of public schools is that they are more effective per unit cost of attainment.

A variety of methods have been used for demonstrating this result. One common feature of these studies is that they are one time small sample surveys mostly based on tools developed by Pratham. The tools used for these surveys are simple and have been standardized on a large sample. Based on these surveys, it has been demonstrated that students in Government schools do not have basic skills in numeracy and language. Studies like Kingdon and Jimneez and Lockheed have tried to control for background factors and have then concluded that private schools have a greater per unit cost attainment.

The methodology of the studies described above flies in the face of educational learning theories that are the basis of the educational system in India since the NCF 2005. Standardized, one shot surveys are not the most efficient way of measuring attainment which is individualized and constructively attained to say the least. Further the most important criteria, for measuring the quality of schools, is the quality of constructive teachinglearning process which has not been assessed by any of the studies mentioned above.

The second point of critique is that the studies described above take no note of the fact that education has inter-generational benefits and it is not correct to compare subjects on the basis of one shot surveys. Controlling for background factors might take care of statistical validity of results but fails to capture the inter-generational effects of schooling. Starting with the Coleman Report there is a long history of school quality research in different contexts, particularly in the United States, which suggests that much of the apparent differences in schools are due to parental choices that propel children from certain backgrounds into certain types of schools. Thus school effects are yet not conclusively proven. Standardized testing may not be the best way of measuring and comparing achievements. Household factors and selectivity bias need to be accounted for while drawing conclusions on effectivity.

The other major point of debate in the push for privatization is that private schools are more efficient. Public schooling is seen as being inefficient in terms of how it uses resources and particularly in ensuring teacher presence.

Almost all the literature on efficiency of private school quotes the World Bank Harvard study of teacher absence. The main finding of this study which is picked and repeatedly quoted is that almost 11 to 25 per cent of public school teachers are absent from work on any particular day. It further found that private school teachers are 2-4 percentages more likely to be present in school than Government school teachers. The World Bank study mentions many more results which are ignored while selectively quoting it on teacher's absence.

Some of the results of the study mentioned above are stated below.

- Teacher compensation has little effect on absence*;* infrastructure provides a stronger incentive to attend school and improving monitoring increases the marginal cost of teacher absence.
- There is little evidence to suggest that greater local ties are associated with lower teacher absence.
- Teachers in private schools and contract teachers, who face very different incentives, have similar or slightly lower absence rates while being paid a fraction of Government teachers' salaries. None of these conclusions signal privatization *per se*.

These results show that teacher absence is not just found in Government schools and is obviously a more complex phenomena requiring deeper study and thicker descriptions and not necessarily market based solutions.

Studies like those of Kingdon, 1996, have pegged their criticism of public schools solely on the criteria of teacher absenteeism and teacher unionism. There is a concern here as has been demonstrated by Panchmukhi and Mehrotra that the oversupply of potential teachers (trained or untrained) may push the market clearing wages for teachers too low. The response to this concern has been that market-clearing wages are desirable for teachers and have even demonstrated that market clearing wages are sufficient for generating a decent standard of living in Uttar Pradesh.

The further argument is that teacher salaries constitute an economic rent because of their absence from school. While the argument for enforcing teacher presence in schools is a valid one, the argument on economic rents needs to be scrutinzsed. The privatization process has to ensure that these rents are eliminated. Privatisation will simply imply that economic rents are being shifted from the teacher to the private sector. It will not ensure that rents are eliminated. Teacher's presence and effective teaching are variables that beg a deeper analysis.

#### **622** ✽ CHAPTER 35

From the above critique it becomes very clear that there is no clear logic for privatization in elementary education in India. Indian education policy is situated within an overbearing economic and political context of international competitiveness as is evident from the clear push towards privatization in all sectors after the Structural Adjustment Policies of 1991. However, policy in any sector is not a positive prescription and has certain very well defined normative aspects to it.

Some of the questions which are relevant in the context of policy are as follows: What are the social relations, subject positions and opportunities generated within education policy?

Answers to this from the Indian context are as follows: One of the primary subjects in elementary education in India, whether in the private or public sector, is the teacher. The other prime subject is the student-parent. In the public sector the teacher is considerably unionized and empowered. Thus social relations are not exploitative in the public sector and could be highly exploitative in the private sector as shown in previous sections.

It is, when one looks at opportunities generated by the policy of privatization, that the direction of policy making in India becomes clearer. Privatization already exists in elementary education in India through the medium of private unaided schools. The massive expansion of private unaided schools and private unrecognized schools, as some of the studies documented above reveal, has been phenomenal in the last few years. It would be worth asking if private school managements have heavy direct and indirect political involvement and whether further opportunities are being generated for this section.

The rush for privatization is being pursued as a policy imperative and can be explained by Olson, who theorizes that "only a separate and 'selective' incentive will stimulate a rational individual in a latent group to act in a group-oriented way"; that is, only a benefit reserved strictly for group members will motivate one to join and contribute to the group. This means that individuals will act collectively to provide private goods, but not to provide public goods. The selected 'elite' group of policy makers, that is, acting collectively to privatize education; it is also the group that is benefitting from commercialization of education.

Olson also predicted that small distributional coalitions tend to form over time in countries. Groups like cotton-farmers, steel-producers, and labour unions will have the incentives to form lobby groups and influence policies in their favor. Since the benefits of these policies are selective incentives concentrated amongst the few coalition's members, the costs are diffused throughout the whole population, the "Logic" dictates that there will be little public resistance to them. Hence as time goes on, these distributional coalitions accumulate in greater and greater numbers.

Both the theoretical insights provided above find their way in explaining the push for privatization in elementary education in India. Privatization will ultimately lead to the transformation of education into a private good and cooperation will ensue amongst coalitions to ensure that this actually happens despite little logic for the policy thrust. Since the benefits are restricted and costs are diffused, little resistance is seen to the policy of privatization in India and the policy rolls on.

Supported by an international pressure and strong internal coalitions there emerges a strong privatization narrative.

There are a few important dynamics of this narrative. There is 'scaffolding of these privatization narratives into institutions and operative networks'. This is followed by constant talk of privatisation. Fairclough (2000) theorizes that much of the action of Governments is the language. In India this 'talk' can be noticed in the Government's policy position on elementary education which is 'dichotomous and even contradictory'. On one hand there is a commitment to EFA and on the other a rollback of resources. Thus statements and fragments of government policies do not make a coherent whole. This is followed by a discourse of derision to pathologi*z*e the public sector. The slew of researches on the 'sick and dispensable' character of publicly provided elementary education in India needs to be evaluated in this context.

The working of the PPP model in education can also be illuminated through theory of the 'Corporate Welfare complex'. The Whitfield complex can be identified in India. Wipro (Azim Premji Foundation), Pratham, ICICI Lombard, Teach India (Bennet-Coleman), Educomp to name a few have taken up education related activities in a major way and are leading examples of Corporate Welfare.

Whitfield further identifies three features of this complex: There emerges a relationship between public (client) agencies and private contractors to whom a number of State functions are outsourced. Slowly these contracts get so over extended that private interests start to take control over public facilities thereby altering the very nature of the cotract. Regulatory and financial concessions to private interests, tax breaks and subsidies follow the development of this public private partnership. The call for PPP in elementary education in India can be explained against this theoretical background. Entities like Pratham which are not for profit are slowly tying up with State Governments for improving the delivery of education under tie-up schemes. The cutting edge of such collaborations and their effectiveness are a matter of research.

Thus clearly, privatization in elementary education is not justified simply on arguments of efficiency and better quality of private provision. It is established above that it is based on research that is contestable in its outcomes. It is still being pursued by a coalition of interested classes for private benefit.

An important outcome of this relentless attack on public education has been the 'alteration of common sense'. Private schools are universally considered 'more efficient' and as undisputed deliverers of quality education. There is a sense of empowerment being offered to parents as consumers while policies like the creation of a publicly funded Common school system through neighbourhood schools could have delivered the constitutional promise of 'education of equitable quality to all'.

### **Gender in Education Policy**

The principle of gender equality is enshrined in the Indian constitution in its Preamble, Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties and Directive Principles. The constitution not only grants equality to women, but also empowers the State to adopt measures of positive discrimination in favour of women.

Within the framework of a democratic policy; our laws, development policies, Plans and programmes have aimed at women's advancement in different spheres. From the Fifth Five Year Plan (1974-78) onwards there has been a marked shift in the approach to women's issues from welfare to development. In recent years, the empowerment of women has been recognized as the central issue in determining the status of women. The National Commission for Women was set up by an Act of Parliament in 1990 to safeguard the rights and legal entitlements of women. The 73rd and 74th Amendments (1993) to the constitution of India have provided for reservation of seats in the local bodies of Panchayats and Municipalities for women, thus laying a strong foundation for their participation in decision making at the local levels.

India has also ratified various international conventions and human rights instruments committing to secure equal rights of women; mainly among them is the ratification of the Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1993.

The Mexico Plan of Action (1975), the Nairobi Forward Looking Strategies (1985), the Beijing Declaration as well as the Platform for Action (1995) and the Outcome Document adopted by the UNGA Session on Gender Equality and Development & Peace for the 21st century, titled "Further actions and initiatives to implement the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action" have been endorsed by India for appropriate policy follow up.

 However, there still exists a wide gap between the goals enunciated in the constitution, legislation, policies, plans, programmes and related mechanisms on the one hand and the situational reality of the status of women in India, on the other. Gender disparity manifests itself in various forms, the most obvious being the trend of continuously declining female ratio in the population in the last few decades. Social stereotyping and violence at the domestic and societal levels are some of the other manifestations. Discrimination against girl children, adolescent girls and women persists in parts of the country.

The underlying causes of gender inequality are related to social and economic structure, which is based on informal and formal norms, and practices. Consequently, the access of women, particularly those belonging to weaker sections including Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes/Other backward Classes and minorities, majority of whom are in the rural areas and in the informal, unorganized sector to education, health and productive resources, among others, is inadequate. Therefore, they remain largely marginalized, poor and socially excluded.

Gender represents a unique concern in India. Gender is 'the key narrative of the nation and has been central as an issue, as a crisis or a problem from the times of the colonial encounter.' In colonial times not only did the 'native' require to be emancipated but 'the woman' shackled by patriarchy was also a target of rescue. Thus 'awakening, progress and change are the key terms used in the context of women's education from the nineteenth century onwards.' It seems that both the colonial state as well as the nationalist discourse was steeped in reformist zeal towards improving the overall condition of women.

Thus for colonial rulers, 'the atrocities practiced against women in India became at once a confirmation of their own modernity and a moral ground on which the civilizing mission could be launched'. However an immediate ambivalence is noticed when policies for education for women are the question. Two core contradictions can be identified as the roots of this ambivalence. The first contradiction is the pure-impure dichotomy closely followed by the public-private duality in relation to women in India. Women were and are regarded as pure due their fertility and role as mothers. Thus they also become repositories of family honor, the protection of which is possible only in the private space of the household. Thus there is a distinct discomfort with pulling the woman out of the private space of the family and household into the public spaces of education.

The public-private dichotomy has dominated the discourse of girl's education through colonial times to present times. Restricting women to the private domain ensured control over their sexuality, whereas 'formal education involves moving into public spaces or interaction with males and socialization as boys moving away from the eventual goal of wifehood and marriage.' Despite this complex interplay of push and pull factors in women's education it had 'definitely come to be a public issue by the 1920s. However there was no radical break with the contradictions identified earlier. Apart from Gandhi, who bought women into public spaces in a significant way, there was little done to alter the centuries' old discourse on women and their education in India.

In the absence of such a radical break there is virtual silence on Gender issues in education policy in India. The post-colonial state has preferred to develop policies to advance girls education. Thus special programmes like Mahila Samakhya have been launched. However even policies like the Right to Free and Elementary Education Act 2009, do not document and emanate a gender concern.

That social structures restrict the ontological view of a female is evident if education policy is reviewed in India.

Women have been conceived as mothers and nurturers ot only in India but in most of Asia. This view was current till the 1960's and was reflected in the differentiated curricula for boys and girls in schools. The Hansa Mehta committee on differentiation of curricula for boys and girls (1964) came down strongly on this view. The committee viewed differentiation as a perpetuation of existing traditions of unequal division of labour, and rejected differentiation on grounds of gender difference as 'unscientific'.

The Kothari commission Report (1964-66) shifted the policy discourse on women's education by coming down on gender differences as socially constructed and unscientific. It looked upon women's education as a contribution to national development and as instrumental to reproducing future citizens.

The National Curriculum Framework of 1975 taking a cue from the Kothari Commission report advocated the 10 + 2 + 3 system. The first 10 years would comprise a common curriculum for all students. Thus the issue of differentiation of curricula on a gender basis was laid to rest at least at the policy level. The Kothari Commission had recommended that adopting science and technology education was essential for social and economic transformation.

The year 1975 was significant for the declaration of the International Women's Year by the United Nations and the setting up of the Committee on the Status of Women in India (CSWI) by the Ministry of Education. The report of the CSWI was a landmark document that substantively shifted the discourse on women's rights. While bringing to focus the entrenched inequities on which women were located, it moved away from generalizations and stressed the different experiences of women from different economic sections of society. It concluded that women's productive roles had hitherto remained unacknowledged in policies and consequently their needs had remained unaddressed.

The committee pointed out that in the realm of social values and attitudes, formal education had failed to initiate change and that if anything, education had served to deepen class differences between women since independence. The committee problematized the notion of relevance of knowledge for women. It sought to extend the definition of knowledge to the hitherto and unexplored domain of local and specific needs of women. The committee pointed out that the premise that education should equip women for roles within the domestic sphere negated their substantive contributions within the productive sphere.

The *Shrama Shakti* report, or the report of the National Commission on Self-employed Women and Women of the Informal Sector, was the first committee which made visible the role and contribution of women in the unorganized sector of the economy.

Education for this large section of women workers needed to address their 'contextualized' and 'diverse' needs. The Commission noted that to promote equality it will not only be necessary to provide for equal opportunities for all, but also its conditions of success.

It recommended that syllabi need to be made more relevant for children of rural areas, by offering practical subjects like animal husbandry and cattle care as options along with subjects like history and science. It also recommended that textbooks be revised to bring women into greater focus.

The National Policy on Education, NPE (1986), has been hailed as a path-breaking document as it emphasized the re-orientation of the national education system to play a 'positive interventionist role in the empowerment of women… the development of new values through redesigned curricula, textbooks, training and orientation of teachers, decision-makers and administrators….'

Coming as it did in the wake of the women's movement, the vision of the NPE echoed the demand that education be 'used as an agent of basic change in the status of women'. Textbooks were revised at various levels following the NPE's recommendations. The NCERT also brought a series of teachers' handbooks to address gender equality in classrooms through curricular transactions.

Analysis of post-NPE textbooks shows, however, that revisions were few, piece-meal and utterly cosmetic.

The NPE Review Committee pointed out that although the NPE (1986) gave prominent space to education for gender equality, there was no reference to gender in the entire chapter on the 'content and process of school education', except for a mention that 'equality of the sexes' is to be one of the ten core curriculum areas. Indeed, the NPERC recommended that a gender perspective be explicitly built into the entire curriculum, including the hidden curriculum.

While the National Curriculum Framework, 2000 was largely seen as regressive for gender equality, the National Curriculum Framework, 2005 focuses on Gender and education of marginalized groups.

Thus a review of policy shows that "education", "equality" and "empowerment" of girls have been used as words in policy and educational documents for long without there being a Gender perspective being built into policy.

For "Equality" as a goal, strategies adopted have focused on increasing representation of these notions of gender in educational material sensitive portrayals of discrimination that girls and women face, portraying positive role models and enacting role reversals of stereotypes neutralizing texts of any gendered references, the formal or sameness approach that focuses on equal treatment rather than equality of outcome*.* 

Parity has been the major objective, not just in terms of enrolment or retention of girls, but also in terms of the curriculum and content. Equality, in this formal approach, is seen as mere parity or identical treatment across gender. Parity is a concept that deals with boys and girls being offered equal access to school, equal facilities and even equal representation in the curriculum and textbooks, but all in numerical and formal terms. Such identical treatment dictates that all practices be gender neutral. This does not necessarily recognize the specific concerns of women in education.

Thus, while ideas of empowerment led to the formation of specific programmes like the Mahila Samakhya Programme for adolescent girls and women, the question however remains if targeted programmes in the' girls education' framework can be an alternative to paradigmatic changes in the system of education for Gender equality of women.

### **Vocational Education and Skills Development**

The emphasis on vocational and technical education is evident from the era of Dalhousie in colonial India. In 1847, a Civil engineering college had been established in Roorkee. Dalhousie sought to replicate this in all the three presidencies with the aim of supporting the colonial Government's expansion in railways and telegraph in India. The Dispatch of 1854; for the first time, recognized the need of giving the people an education of "such a character as may be practically useful to the people of India in their different spheres of life." In 1904, the Governor General, Council of Indian Education, made resolution regarding technical education and its promotion. The Hartog Committee (1929) proposed the diversion of more students towards industrial or commerce career at the end of middle stage. Similar emphasis was found in the Sargent Plan (1944).

In recent years skill development has emerged as a key outcome of concern for secondary education in India. Secondary education itself now is seen as a key stage in the skills development framework. Unlike before where it was seen merely as a conduit to higher education now secondary education has to be effective enough to act as a terminal stage in education. Thus it is charged with creating a threshold level of skills in a graduate. Inevitably skill development is being linked with vocationalisation of education. In policy, skills development is also being underpinned by an ideological thrust on the knowledge economy.

The second half of the nineties decade saw an immense thrust on the idea of a knowledge society with the OECD and the world bank defining "*knowledge-based economies*"–as 'economies which are directly based on the production, distribution and use of knowledge and information' (OECD 1996). Clear identifying features of the knowledge society are codification of knowledge and its transmission through information technology, employment demand for a highly skilled workforce and emphasis on collaborative networks for diffusion of knowledge. The hinge on which the knowledge society operates is science and technology. The key transformational tool is Government policy, specifically State education policy.

Thus societies must transform in at least four areas for becoming knowledge economies. Overall education systems have to be capable of 'skilling human capital'. Collaborative networks are also an essential feature of knowledge economies and have to be created. Thus 'Knowwho' involves information about who knows what and who knows how to do what. It involves the formation of special social relationships which make it possible to get access to experts and use their knowledge efficiently.' Curriculum must change accordingly to focus on science and technology. Finally policy has to orient itself to skill development and vocationalization.

Skill development policy has been pursued by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) and Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) in India. They formulate policies for the Vocational Education and Training (VET). The MHRD is assisted by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT).The AICTE prepares curriculum and imparts vocational higher education through polytechnics while the NCERT prepares curriculum and imparts vocational education at school level and through open schools.

The MoLE is assisted by Directorate General of Employment and Training (DGE & T) which imparts vocational training through Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) and Skills Development Initiative Scheme (SDIS). The CTS provides training to 1.2 million people through Industrial Training Institutes (it is). SDIS provides training to 1 million people through Vocational Training Providers (VTPs).

Both the ministries are developing separate frameworks called National Vocational Qualification Framework (NVQF) and National Vocational Educational Qualification Framework (NVEQF) for curriculum design, standardization and certification.

All these initiatives are underpinned by National Policy on Skills Development (NPSD) which is the main driver policy. It has set a target of providing skills training to 500 million people by 2022. Under NPSD, National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a Public Private Partnership (PPP) has been set up to provide funding, facilitation and advocacy by means of 21 Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). All policies are framed at the Centre and implemented at State level by the States.

The National Policy on Skills Development, 2009, clearly reflects the focus on skills development and on the role of schools in advancing skills development in India. It enumerates a range of employability skills, including vocational skills as essential to skills development. It also mandates that curricula be repositories of these skills. Thus if Skill Development is treated as the core process, in India as in the rest of the world, policy envisages vocationalization as a route to skill development.

Vocationalisation of education has historically been seen as a route to skill development in school. It aims at laying foundations for the world of work. UNESCO associates Vocational Education (VE) with the upper secondary stage of education and defines it as education designed to prepare skilled personnel at lower level of qualifications for one or group of occupations, traders or jobs. Recognizing this, The National Policy on Education of India in 1986 made in education system, apart from organizing the education structure into 10 + 2 + 3 pattern, it majorly promoted vocational education at +2 stage as a separate stream.

Accordingly the NCERT proposed a scheme for introduction of vocational education. A Centrally Sponsored Scheme (CSS 1988) was introduced in 1988. This policy was further revised by NCERT in 1992, for the purpose of creating skilled manpower. The focus of this revision was to orient vocational education for the creation of highly skilled workers and to make education job-oriented and relevant for which curriculum restructuring was undertaken. Significantly there was the urgency to integrate academic and vocational skills and bring vocational education under a national qualification framework, to increase vertical mobility.

The scheme is again under review to attune policy to the needs of a globalized knowledge economy. The focus of this revision is on furthering the agenda underscored above. Additionally there is a focus on inculcation of lifelong learning, public-private partnership, tracking at lower secondary level of education etc.

Despite the policy focus on vocational education, it was realized that the vocational education stream is quite small enrolling less than three per cent of students at the upper secondary level. Additionally there were problems even in skills outcomes of vocational education courses. The main issues in vocational education were low enrollment, weak labor market outcomes and lack of employability skills in students graduating from vocational courses.

The World bank further advises that 'to make the existing vocational education system relevant to market needs, a major restructuring of the system and how it is managed will be needed'. Further the policy direction suggested by the World Bank includes *ensuring private sector participation in management of institutions and curriculum design,* moving from a system which is exclusively financed by the Government to a system which is increasingly financed by the private sector and by students paying user fees, *ensuring that vocational education is not a dead end* is not seen as an option of last resort by prospective students etc.

Separate tracking failed to deliver outcomes in India as in the rest of the world. This led to a multi-pronged policy attempt to restructure secondary school education for skill development. At least two policy agendas have been analyzed above. The National Curriculum Framework for school Education, 2005, governs the academic content of school education. The National Vocational Education Qualifications Framework governs vocational education in Indian schools up-to higher levels of education.

Accordingly, currently policy is seeking to operationalize the National Vocational Education Qualifications Framework (NVEQF) to facilitate lateral and vertical mobility for students. Four main issues give rise to a rationale for a National Qualifications framework.

The National Vocational Educational Qualification Framework (NVEQF) is expected to bring school level vocational education and polytechnics under its purview. One of its objectives is to facilitate international recognition of national standards and that of Indian qualifications from secondary to doctorate levels of education. The framework will have a competency based modular approach with provision of credit accumulation and transfer. There will be collaboration with industry for development of quality standards, model curriculum, assessment and testing procedures. It aims to facilitate vertical and horizontal mobility of students and provide them options of multiple entry and exit through schools, colleges and institutes of vocational education.

The NVEQF serves as an instrument for classifying qualifications according to a set of criteria for levels of learning outcomes. It has specified levels of learning achievements, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 10 levels which depend on the complexity of learning; 1 is the least complex and 10 the most complex.

Levels 1-2 are of the standard of secondary education and basic vocational trades training. Levels 3-4 are similar to advanced trade certificate or vocational certificate. Levels 5-6 are approximate to diploma, and graduate certificates/advanced diploma qualifications. Levels 7-10 approximate to qualifications of graduate and postgraduate standard.

Each level on the NVEQF is described by a statement of learning known as a level descriptor. The level descriptor provides a broad indication of learning outcomes that are appropriate to a qualification at that level. They are designed to support the reviewing of specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria in order to develop particular modules and units and to assign credits at the appropriate level.

The NVEQF has been piloted in Haryana and it involves the extension of vocational education to secondary level (classes 9-10), in addition to higher secondary level in Government schools (classes 11-12). This in itself is a controversial policy decision.

In India, the National Curriculum Framework for School Education, 2005, (henceforth NCF, 2005) provides a reference point for understanding the policy context of curricular and structural changes for skills development. The focus of the NCF (2005) is on restoring 'dignity of labor' and repositioning the fundamental elements of Nai-Talim or Gandhian Basic Education. In this model, 'work' at school had myriad applicability. It could be used pedagogically to link the context of the learner to the subject matter at hand. In the process it would become a medium of skill-formation. This beautiful integration was ruptured by policy in two ways. Firstly the Kothari Commission (1964-66) introduced the concept of work experience that later got extended to the idea of Socially Useful Productive Work (SUPW). Operationalized in this manner, 'work' got relegated to a few allocated time slots in the school day. Later the National Policy on Education (1986) created two distinct streams at the secondary level-the vocational and the academic.

In order to remedy this rupture, the NCF, 2005, positions the idea of 'work centered education'. This formulation gives place to generic competencies, also identified by the World Bank as markers of employability in the globalized 'knowledge economy'. The position paper of the National Focus Group on Work and Education clearly identifies some generic competencies that a child would acquire throughout the primary and middle stages of Education. It is here that Indian curricular policy reforms paradigm clashes with the skills-development approach of the OECD-World Bank. Despite the core agreement on generic skills, the NVEQF looks at competency based outcomes, whereas The National Curriculum Framework clearly pushes curriculum policy towards a Gandhian work based skills development approach.

Theoretically both these policy frameworks are in opposite directions. Competency based curriculum theories see curriculum as a body of knowledge to be transmitted; and attempts to achieve certain ends in students-the product. The view of curriculum, as a product, implies that objectives are set as a plan drawn up, and then applied, and the the outcomes (products) measured. It is a way of thinking about education that is concerned with competencies. Franklin Bobbitt (1918) and Ralph W. Tyler (1949) are two theorists that dominate theory and practice within this tradition.

This approach to curriculum theory involves detailed attention to what people need to know in order to work, live their lives and so on. A restricted, example of this approach can be found in many training programmes, where particular tasks or jobs have been analyzed-broken down into their component elements-and lists of competencies drawn up.

 Bobbitt's work and theory met with mixed responses with one sayin criticism that was made, and can continue to be made, of such approaches is that there is no social vision or programme to guide the process of curriculum construction. It is a technical exercise.

 The attraction of this way of approaching curriculum theory and practice is that it is systematic and has considerable organizing power. Central to the approach is the formulation of behavioral objectives, providing a clear notion of outcome so that content and method may be organized and the results evaluated. The NVEQF clearly pulls in this direction.

 Another way of looking at curriculum theory and practice is via process. In this sense curriculum is not a physical thing, but rather the interaction of teachers, students and knowledge. In other words, curriculum is what actually happens in the classroom.

 Lawrence Stenhouse (1975) theorized the process model of curriculum theory and practice. He defined curriculum tentatively: 'A curriculum is an attempt to communicate the essential principles and features of an educational proposal in such a form that it is open to critical scrutiny and capable of effective translation into practice' which we will now implement.

As Cornbleth (1990) has argued, curriculum cannot be taken out of context, and the context in which it was formed was the school. Curriculum theory and practice only makes sense when considered alongside notions like class, teacher, course, lesson and so on. It is not a concept that stands on its own. Apart from its Vygovtskian roots the National curriculum framework is based on the above theoretical structure.

Thus in India policy basically pulls in two different directions as far as curriculum policy for skill development is concerned. This has implications for teacher's quality and capacity and teacher's education, both of which are central to skill development. The curriculum and qualifications framework envisaged by the NVEQF demands that along with vocational trainers there is a need for teachers who can understand and implement the integration of general and academic streams of education. Teachers need to be trained to recognize competencies and assess them, all of which are essential to skill development outcomes.

Like in other areas, policy in skill development and vocationalization are underpinned by an urgency reflected in arguments of dismal quality and scores. In a departure from past policy, two Indian states-Himachal Pradesh and Tamil Nadu participated in the PISA 2009+. The results of the assessment have since then been referred to for pushing a skills development agenda in India.

PISA tests students in reading and numeracy, key skills required for a knowledge economy. The average reading literacy score for Himachal Pradesh, one of the educationally better states in India, was the lowest average reading score observed in PISA 2009 and PISA 2009+. In Himachal Pradesh, 11 per cent of students are estimated to have a proficiency in reading literacy that is at or above the baseline. It can be tentatively said that 89 per cent of students in Himachal Pradesh are estimated to be below this baseline level as compared to 81 per cent of student performing at or above the baseline level in reading in the OECD countries. In Tamil Nadu, 17 per cent of students are estimated to have a proficiency in reading literacy that is at or above the baseline. This can be roughly interpreted to mean that 83 per cent of students in Tamil Nadu are estimated to be below this baseline level.

Students in the Tamil Nadu attained a mean score on the PISA mathematical literacy scale as the same observed in Himachal Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu-India, 15 per cent of students are proficient in mathematics at least to the baseline level. This compares to 75 per cent in the OECD countries, on average.

Scores on scientific literacy scale in the same assessment were as follows. In Himachal Pradesh 11 per cent of students are proficient in science at least to the baseline level. Students in Tamil Nadu in India were estimated to have a mean score on the scientific literacy scale, which is below the means of all OECD countries, but significantly above the mean observed in the other Indian state, Himachal Pradesh. In Tamil Nadu-India, 16 per cent of students are proficient in science at least to the baseline level as compared to 82 per cent in the OECD countries, on average.

#### **634** ✽ CHAPTER 35

Proficiency in English language is also considered an important skill in the globalized knowledge economy. Advantage in English language communication is one of the key factors parents consider while opting for private school education in India. Do Indian graduates really acquire this skill in schools? The Wall Street Journal describes the difficulty that many organizations are having in recruiting able graduates in India. It states that the number of high school and college graduates who come through the door and who can communicate effectively in English is staggeringly low and that many lack a grasp of educational basics such as reading comprehension. It cites a Customer Contact company that can hire just three out of 100 applicants.

It is accepted that English is important in Indian schools. However, some of the literature surveyed surprisingly claims that most of the population does not gain this skill through the secondary school system. Many secondary schools still rely on an outdated grammar-based approach to teaching English that does not prepare students to communicate effectively in the language.

Thus, with contestable evidence of falling scores in science and mathematics and lack of proficiency in English, amongst Indian secondary school and university, graduates a sense of pessimism created around education, creating a discourse for policy shifts of the kind outlined above.

### **Higher Education Policy in India**

Higher education has been 'the one area where we have always exceeded our targets'. However, this 'achievement' is again a reflection of, not so much a result of coherent and well planned policies. Since colonial times 'the class-base of political power naturally led to a greater emphasis on secondary and higher education which benefit the 'haves' rather than the 'have nots' so that the expansion of programmes at these stages received early attention, greater priority and more adequate allocations than those of mass education'.

Expansion of education in the colonial times and early years of independence can also be explained on the basis of the expansion of industry, both in public and private sectors, and the large expansion of the services sector (including governmental services at all levels). This created an immense demand for the products of secondary schools and universities.

Higher education policies take a sudden critical turn in the 1990's which was a decade of turmoil in higher education; and the government approaches meant almost 'killing of higher education'. The defining characteristics in higher education after the 1990's are a clear absence of policy in higher education accompanied by public sector disinvestment in this sector.

Like in elementary education the roots of the turn policy in higher education can be traced to the National Policy on Education (1986).

According to the NPE-86 "Higher education provides people with an opportunity to reflect on the critical social, economic, cultural, moral and spiritual issues facing humanity. It contributes to national development through dissemination of specialized knowledge and skills. It is therefore crucial factor for survival*.* Being at the apex of the educational pyramid, it has also a key role in producing teachers for the education system." Therefore, it proposed, "in the near future, the main emphasis will be on consolidation of, and expansion of facilities in the existing institutions. Urgent steps will be taken to protect the system from degradation."

 The NPE however proposed raising of resources by "mobilizing donations", "raising fees", "effecting some savings by efficient use of facilities", "levying a cess or charge on the user agencies". The policy document clearly stated that all these measures will "reduce the burden on State resources" and create "a greater sense of responsibility within the educational system."

In the NPE, higher education would work only through the "creation of a system of performance appraisals of institutions according to standards and norms set at the National or State levels" The policy also upheld the creation of "the spirit of autonomy for educational institutions".

The paradigm reflected by the National Policy on Education, 1986, follows exactly the policies prescribed by the World Bank's for restructuring of higher education in developing countries. (World Bank 1986). From the eighties the World Bank positioned a picture in higher education through all their documents and publications. The general picture painted positioned a shortage of funds. The only way out was for students to bear a large part of the burden of education costs. It was argued that only the relatively better off students were able to enter higher education; subsidizing those makes for inequality and not egalitarianism; if the same subsidy were shifted instead to primary education, the effect would be towards equality. The World Bank had suggested cost recovery from students (parents), educational loans to students desirous of higher education, and pure private educational institutions, which would charge fees sufficient to meet costs and make a profit.

A least the following key points emerge from the World Bank initiated prescriptions for higher education.

- Higher education should not have the highest priority claim on incremental public resources available for education in many developing countries, especially those that have not yet achieved adequate access, equity and quality at the primary and secondary levels.
- The social rates of return on investments in primary and secondary education usually exceed the returns on higher education.
- Cost recovery may be increased for public institutions by means of elimination of subsidies.

- Strong participation of the private sector because for such sector the creation of such institutions might be more attractive due to a low cost per student.
- Even though governments must establish a general framework for the functioning of private institutions, the World Bank advised "the avoidance of regulation on the cost of enrollment and tuition", and "the establishment of accreditation and evaluation mechanisms for such institutions."
- The World Bank recommended that the representatives of the private business sector should be included in the "Government agencies that work with public and private universities."

The government took several measures and constituted several committees for the implementation of the National Policy on Education and for gradual withdrawal of subsidy to higher education as dictated by the World Bank. Among the significant steps that it immediately took are:

- Freezing budgets for higher education.
- Financial reforms to raise resources through the creation of self-financing courses, the creation of student loans lie any other consumer goods loans without any social vision.
- The reclassification of higher education as a Merit good and subsequently as a Merit 2 good.

An indication of the influence of cororates in higher education was the Ambani-Birla report "A Policy Framework for Reforms in Education" which was invited by the government and was tabled in April 2000. Considering education as a very profitable market, these two industrialists made a case for full cost recovery from students and immediate privatization of entire higher education except those areas of education involving "liberal arts and performing arts."

Clearly there is a privatization agenda being pursued by the Indian state for higher education. There is clear and persistent statement of this agenda in Plan documents. The approach paper to the twelfth five year plan states that 'private initiatives in higher education including PPP models will be actively promoted'. Both the eleventh and the twelfth plans are pegged to the concept of inclusive growth. However despite there being no clear and established link between inclusive growth and privatization, PPP is the policy that is proposed by both plans. This is a clear case of contradiction. Six directional statements are made in the twelfth plan that indicates a move towards privatization. These are:

- Removal of entry barriers for private participation.
- Encouragement of PPP.
- Reexamination of the not-for-profit tag in higher education.
- Access of public funds to private players.

● Creation of large education hubs in the country under public sector enterprises but supported by private sector.

Thus 'many of the recent policy initiatives mark a transition in the history of higher education in India … from a system imbedded in welfare statism to a system based on neo-liberal market philosophy.' In a final word, the transition seems to be complete and dangerously irreversible.'

Five higher education bills proposed after 2000 clearly indicate the Indian states policy shift towards privatization in higher education.

- The Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill, 2010 was introduced in the Lok Sabha in May 2010.
- The Educational Tribunals Bill 2010.
- The Higher Education and Research (THER) Bill 2011 and was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in December 2011. An all powerful commission is sought to be created for the centralization of all aspects related to higher education including starting of a university.
- Another draft bill for starting innovation universities was also circulated. It also re-modified as Universities for Research and Innovation Bill, 2012 and was introduced in the Lok Sabha in May 2012.
- The Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Bill does not fulfill the objective of social control over self-financing or private unaided institutions. The fees and salaries to teachers will not be regulated as the minister assured private school principals.

### **Conclusion**

Thus, there is a clear continuity from the colonial era in Indian education to the present policy regime constructed by the Indian state. The educational ideal of the colonial times was not a brown sahib but a colonial citizen who was subservient to the needs of the colonial state. This citizen was dressed in concepts of rational behavior and practiced in the norms of civil society. Education provided the site for this dressing and practice. However, whereas the liberal ideal of civil society was based on 'equality, autonomy, freedom of entry and exit, contract, deliberative procedures of decision making…'. In the colonial state 'the domain of civil social institutions is restricted to a fairly small section of citizens.' Colonial education policy is also underpinned with a problematic notion of gender which has carried down to present times. Gender as a category of educational policy analysis has been replaced by girl's education as the central concern of policy.

Education has also become a site where technological change of the recent decades is entrenched and proliferating. A key element of this technological change is the centrality that Information and Communication technology has come to acquire in India. This change in technology is coupled with the increasing emphasis on professionalization of education. The themes of 'skill', 'quality', 'efficiency' and 'privatization' are the doors through which this technological change has entered education policy discourse in India. While technological change itself is natural to human progress, the issue of equity takes precedence over technology. Thus we see a digital divide which is economic, social or cultural deprivation generated by missing ICT access and skills. In the modern knowledge and information based world, economic opportunities, such as employability, depend on ICT access and skills, further privileging the elite over the deprived sections of Indian society.

In India, the State has thrown its weight behind the educational and technological needs of the elite. Apple (1979) reveals how the State's powerful investment in education can disrupt the dissemination of knowledge in society, not only by projecting a particular ideological position, but also by excluding particular demands, interests and knowledge-forms, preventing them from crystallizing as sources of contradiction and dissent. The knowledge of the ruling class, sets stringent limits on other knowledge production, in order to restrain forms of cultural and political response that could undermine their powerful position in society.

 The neo-liberal project in fact involves 'an immense task to create a truly organic ideology, one that seeks to spread throughout society and to create a new form of national popular will'. Thus 'what has been accomplished has been a successful translation of an economic-doctrine into the language of experience, moral imperative and common sense'.

Apple thus draws attention towards the process by which 'elements of ideologies of groups in dominance become truly popular'. The popularity of these ideas is achieved by pushing them in a 'rupture' in the beliefs of 'historically' less powerful groups. This rupture is used to build a 'shift in common sense'. This rupture originates from real and contradictory experiences of a large portion of the population. They connect with real needs, fears and hopes of a group of people.

 In education policy in India, policy makers have been able to latch on to the concern that parents have about the economic future of their children. This has been combined with a sustained effort to shift 'common sense' associated with schooling. Through sustained 'construction of commonsense', private schools have been equated with 'efficiency and quality' whereas public school have been equated with inefficiency and low quality. Government schooling does suffer from problems of state failure and thus pose a real problem, but these necessitate a different set of policy responses rather than a simplistic move towards the market. Education policy has found and utilized a rupture in the lives of ordinary people and has 'cemented conservative educational positions into our daily life.' This cementing is being done on the basis of research that contains preconceived notions of the efficacy of markets.

No matter how radical some of these proposed reforms may be but they have redefined the terrain of debate for all things educational. Understanding this redefined terrain is essential for analysis of the discourse of educational policy reform in India.

Thus education aids in the formation of a 'subservient citizen'. Under the colonial State the ideal citizen was the subservient citizen. Colonial education policy also aimed at implanting 'civil society' in India. While colonialism had its run in India till 1947 in post-independence, the ideal of a subservient citizen continued to dominate education policy. In the era of structural readjustment policies, the idea of subservient citizen has undergone change. Now the citizen is the consumer whose commonsense has been so altered that 'now equality means guaranteeing individual choice in a free market'. The role of the State now is not merely administrative and coercive and an arm of capitalism but rather as 'educative and formative.' It 'exercises moral and educative leadership of a new hegemonic bloc by gaining active consent over those it rules'. As a result, education policy is shifting to display at least the following key features:

- A shift towards Public-Private Participation in elementary as well as higher education.
- Imposition of standards in education thus centralizing government control over curriculum, teaching and research.
- The growing pressure to make the needs of business and industry into the primary goals of the education system.
